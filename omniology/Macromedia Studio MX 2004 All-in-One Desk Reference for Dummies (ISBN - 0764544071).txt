About the Authors
Damon Dean has been working in Internet technologies and development for
nearly a decade as an Editor, Producer, and Developer. As a Development
Editor for Sybex, Damon was responsible for developing both the multimedia
and computer game book lines. After developing those properties into prof-
itable units, he moved on to Postlinear Entertainment, where he produced
and designed online multiplayer computer games for publishers such as Sega
and MGM. Three years later, Damon took his software development skills and
moved into Web development. As a founding member of 415 Productions,
Damon worked with several large companies, including Credit Suisse, Robert
Mondavi, HP, and BART. His application design and development resume
includes architecting and building Content Management Systems, Extranets,
corporate Intranets, and enterprise CRMs. After four years at 415, Damon
moved on in the summer of 2001 to be the Internet Services Director at a 
private foundation in Oakland, CA.
Damon has written several books dating back to 1996. His first book, A Pocket
Tour of Multimedia on the Internet (Sybex), was eventually translated into five
languages. In 1997, Damon began a relationship with Wiley Publishing (formerly
IDG Books), and has written several books for them, including Web Channel
Development For Dummies, FrontPage 2000 For Dummies Quick Reference, Act!
2000 For Dummies Quick Reference (Co-Author), and most recently, Cascading
Style Sheets For Dummies.
Andy Cowitt is a freelance Web developer who spent five years learning the
trade at the award-winning firm, 415, Inc. While at 415, Andy worked on multi-
media presentations and Web sites for Apple, Oracle, Macromedia, the San
Francisco Symphony, KQED, and Stag’s Leap Wine Cellars. He’s been using
Macromedia’s products since each of them arrived on the scene. In his spare
time, Andy plays guitar and ukulele and makes videos. He lives in Oakland
with illustrator Michael Wertz and their dog, Olive.

Acknowledgments
Damon Dean and Andy Cowitt: As with any book, there’s a big cast of char-
acters that help to bring it all together. First and foremost, we’d like to
acknowledge the patient, thoughtful work of editors: Project Editor Paul
Levesque, Copy Editor Jean Rogers, and Technical Editors, Danilo Celic,
Jim Kelly, Ron Rockwell and Sheldon Sargent. Additionally, we’d like to thank
Acquisitions Editor Steve Hayes, who for some reason, keeps asking us to
come back and write books. I guess we miss our deadlines better than the
other guys.
Damon would like to thank Craig Ziegler, Vincent James, Eric Schmidt, and
Daniel Hai, all of whom work at the California HealthCare Foundation, for
their support while writing this book. In addition, Damon would like to thank
his friends and family, who consistently put up with his crankiness as this
book got closer and closer to being completed, specifically Chris Jennings,
Ryan Clifford, Matthew Allington, and of course, his parents, John Dean and
Kathy Dean. He’d also like to thank his grandmother . . . just because.
Andy wishes to thank his parents, Ben and Adria Cowitt, and his extended
family, with special nods to Michael Wertz, Phil Benson, and especially
Damon Dean, for all their encouragement and support.

Macromedia Studio MX 2004 All-in-One Desk Reference For Dummies
xxx

Introduction
M
acromedia has always been known as a leading-edge design company.
Since it introduced Director more than a decade ago, Macromedia
has shrewdly developed products (like Fireworks and Dreamweaver) and
acquired products (such as Flash and FreeHand) geared toward turning
artists into developers. With its acquisition of Allaire, Macromedia added
a powerful technology platform to its suite of design-oriented products.
Macromedia Studio MX 2004 represents the natural evolution and integra-
tion of the Macromedia products into a single set of Web development tools.
The result? We’ve worked in Web development since its inception, and we
can honestly say that there’s never been a product that is as user friendly,
powerful, and complete as Macromedia Studio MX 2004.
About This Book
Macromedia Studio MX 2004 All-in-One Desk Reference For Dummies (we know,
it’s a mouthful) is designed to be a hands-on, easy-to-understand guide to the
features in all the Macromedia Studio products. The no-nonsense approach is
designed to help you begin to build Web sites by covering the basics in a clear
and concise fashion. The way we see it, you’ve got things to do, and reading a
book, even a clever one, takes up valuable time. The faster we can help you
do something or answer a question, the better.
How to Use This Book
You can use this book in a few different ways:
✦As a reference: If you already have a Web site and use Macromedia
Studio, this book can be a handy refresher for that thing you couldn’t
quite remember how to do. Whether it’s exporting graphics to
Macromedia Flash from FreeHand, or the right syntax for a query
in ColdFusion, use this book to fill in those gaps that we all have . . .
especially as we get older.
✦To guide you through building a Web site: Several authors contributed
to the creation of this book. All of us have a wealth of experience in the
process of building Web sites. In this book, we’ve tried to impart as
much of our collective knowledge about the processes and pitfalls of
building Web sites using these tools as we can.

Three Presumptuous Assumptions
2
✦To learn about the tools: In this All-in-One Desk Reference, each mini-
book has at most 150 pages to cover a product or topic, which means
that we get right to the point and make the topics covered easy to
understand. We believe that this approach makes figuring out these
products easier.
Three Presumptuous Assumptions
Before you dive in to the book, we thought we should give you some advance
warning of our expectations. We know, you’re the audience, so we shouldn’t
be presuming anything! But, just so you know where we’re coming from, here
are our three basic assumptions about you, the reader:
✦You’re in a hurry. Frankly, if you wanted a more in-depth book, you’d
have picked up a regular For Dummies book on one or all of these prod-
ucts. Hence the no-nonsense, get it done, and keep on moving approach
you’re gonna see inside this book.
✦You know something about Web development. This isn’t a book where
we’re going to spend a lot of time talking about HTML and how it works.
So you won’t find a chapter anywhere in this book titled, “What the
Internet Is and How It Works.”
✦You’ll experiment on your own. The approach here is to give you
quick, useful examples of how things work across all these products. In
some cases, the examples can be fairly sophisticated. In most cases,
though, it’s the basics. Our hope is that you’ll take those basic examples
and build your own, more complex ones on top of that, according to the
complexity of your site.
Macintosh versus Windows
Macromedia Studio is both a Windows and a Macintosh product. In this book,
you see us use the Windows commands, and the figures are all showing
Windows XP. The reason we chose to use the Windows version is because
the ColdFusion MX 6.1 Developer Edition is included on the Windows version,
but not the Macintosh version of the product. If you are using Macromedia
Studio on the Mac, you can still do everything in Book VI if you’re using
ColdFusion at your place of business or if your Internet Service Provider (ISP)
supports ColdFusion.
In general, you can convert between Windows (PC) and Macintosh key com-
mands by using the following equivalencies:

How This Book Is Organized
3
✦The Ctrl key on a PC is equivalent to the Cmd (Ô) key on a Mac.
✦The Alt key on a PC is equivalent to the Option key on a Mac.
✦The Enter key on a PC is equivalent to the Return key on a Mac.
How This Book Is Organized
Like all the All-in-One Desk References, this book’s chapters are organized
into minibooks. Most of the minibooks revolve around products, but one is
geared toward the Web development process. The following sections
describe each minibook in more detail.
Book I: An Introduction to Building Web Sites
Before we jump into the products in the Macromedia Studio suite, we want
to frame the conversation around how Web sites get built: things to con-
sider, organizing yourself, and so on. This minibook walks you through how
to figure out what it is you’re really building, and how you should go about
preparing to build it.
Book II: Dreamweaver MX 2004
Dreamweaver MX 2004 is the crux of any Web development effort with
Macromedia Studio, so naturally, this is a good place to start. In this mini-
book, you get a hands-on look at how you can use Dreamweaver to create
and manage your Web sites, whether they’re more design-oriented (with
Macromedia Flash) or technology-driven (with ColdFusion).
Book III: Fireworks MX 2004
Whereas Dreamweaver is the tool that helps you manage your Web site,
Fireworks MX 2004 is designed to spur your creative vision. This minibook
shows you how to use the variety of tools in this impressive program to
bring the look and feel of your site to life. It also shows you how to use
Fireworks in conjunction with the other Macromedia Studio products (such
as Macromedia Flash) effectively.
Book IV: FreeHand MX
This is the minibook for the true illustrators. Whether the final product is a
Flash-based or a traditional HTML-based site, FreeHand MX gives designers
the tools they need to create compelling imagery. In this minibook, you find
out how to turn your ideas into working graphical art to be used in a variety
of Web applications.

Book V: Macromedia Flash MX 2004
Macromedia Flash MX 2004 is probably the most exciting of the Macromedia
products. Macromedia Flash delivers animation, sound, and interactivity to
the Web like no other product ever has. If you’ve ever wanted to find out
how to use this tool to add some new zeal to your Web site, then this is the
minibook for you!
Book VI: ColdFusion MX 6.1 Developer Edition
ColdFusion, once left for dead by many in the industry, now appears well
poised to lead mainstream Web development into the dynamic content
arena. In this minibook, you too can find out just how easy it is to use
ColdFusion to create dynamic Web sites.
Book VII: Contribute 2
In this minibook, we introduce you to the newest member of the Macromedia
family, Contribute 2. Designed as a collaborative tool that turns your hard
development work into an easy interface for non-techies to update and pub-
lish content to the Web, Contribute puts the power of building Web sites in
the hands of the people you work with. In this minibook, you find everything
you need to know to get you and your collaborators up and running with
Contribute in no time flat.
Icons Used in This Book
Along the way, when there’s something of interest to point out, we toss in
one of the icons you see in the left margins. When you see one, slow down
for a moment to check it out to see what’s up!
If there’s a way to make something easier, or a more commonly accepted
way of doing something, we tell you about it. This is the icon to look for!
When we really want to reinforce something, we throw in a Remember icon.
Pitfall ahead! That’s what this icon is all about. If something could cause
trouble, we let you know.

Where to Go from Here

Because we love technology, you have to forgive us for geeking out every
now and then. When we do, though, we let you know with this icon.
This icon highlights new features in the Macromedia Studio MX 2004 suite of
products.
Where to Go from Here
If you’ve read this far, then you may actually be a candidate for reading this
book cover to cover! From here, we suggest you dive right in to whatever
section you’re most interested in. Remember, all these minibooks are self-
contained and don’t require you to read the others. So have at it. It’s buffet
time, and your plate needs fillin’ up!

S
o you want to build a Web site? Well, congratulations! If you’re read-
ing this book, then you’ve probably already purchased a copy of
Macromedia Studio MX 2004, and you’re ready to dive right in. Macromedia
Studio is a fantastic tool that enables you to create a wide array of content
and graphics to deploy on a Web site that is dynamic and easy to maintain.
But software isn’t all you need in order to create a wonderful Web site. It
also takes creativity, a good eye, a well-thought-out plan, and some serious
soul searching about why you want to undertake this endeavor in the first
place. This chapter offers some insight into how sites get built, why they are
created, and who they are aimed at. So grab your pen and paper and get
ready to jot down your own ideas about the great site that you want to
build.
Understanding Why People Build Web Sites
In the early days of the Internet, all Web sites generally looked the same and
served similar functions. Back then, an average Web site could be described
as a big online book with linked pages. In short, in its infancy, the Internet
was not all that interesting graphically and was severely lacking in interac-
tive sophistication.
All that has changed. Today’s Internet is a dynamic amalgam of text, graph-
ics, interactive tools, commerce, and communication. If you are part of a
business, an association, the government, or an academic institution,
chances are a Web site supports some or all of the mission of the group. But
not every venture requires a Web site, which naturally leads to the question,
“Why build a Web site?” Most organizations and individuals establish a pres-
ence on the Internet for one or more of the following reasons:

Finding Your Place on the Web
10
✦To sell a product or service directly online, as shown in Figure 1-1
✦To provide information or tools
✦To provide an extension of — or support for — products and services
✦To find other organizations or people to work in a particular area of
interest
✦To introduce and promote an organization and its mission
✦To remain competitive with other organizations that are already on the
Internet
✦To promote community development by bringing groups of people
together around ideas, people, or causes, either online or in person
✦To share artwork, writing, or photographs
Finding Your Place on the Web
Before you begin to think about the kind of site you’re going to build (either
for yourself or for your organization), you should consider each of the fol-
lowing questions carefully. Doing so can help you target your site to an
appropriate audience and prepare yourself for the work ahead.

Book I
Chapter 1

Finding Your Place on the Web
11
✦Consider your content:
• What is the content going to be on your site? Is it unique?
• How often will you be updating this content?
• Are there any other sites that already do what you want to do? If so,
how will you differentiate your site?
Consider the early explosion of sites during the dot-com boom. At one
point, more than five pet sites were all trying to hawk their wares to
users. Only one survived, and that was because it was a traditional
retailer first. Market saturation is a sure way to spell doom for your ven-
ture, so be sure to check out the competition first!
✦Select a format and interface:
• In what formats will your content be delivered? Will you just use text
and graphics, or will you also need animation and/or forms that
respond to user input?
• What are the technical requirements needed to view your content?
Will users need a video or audio player or plug-in? For example, to
view a Flash animation, users need the Macromedia Flash Player
plug-in.
✦Know your audience:
• What audience or audiences are you trying to reach with this content?
• Do they need or want it?
• Is there any other place they can get this content already?
• What are the demographics and technical capabilities of this 
audience?
• If your site has more than one audience, are there differences
between them and do they need the content delivered differently? If
so, you will want to take advantage of ColdFusion’s dynamic script-
ing language to deliver different content to different audiences.
✦Manage your workload:
• How much time and effort are you willing to give in order to support
this site?
• Are other people working on the site with you?
• Who’s going to create the graphical design for the site? Of course, if
it’s you, you’ve got powerful tools at your disposal with Macromedia
Studio MX 2004.
• Are there any deadlines you need to keep in mind when developing
your site?

What Drives People to the Web
12
These questions have no right or wrong answers. Instead, they’re designed
to help you formulate an idea of where you’re going when you’re building a
site. Frankly, if you’re building a personal site, then these questions are moot
to some degree because you can build whatever you want and it may not
matter whether someone else can read it or see it. Of course, if you’re think-
ing about selling your new products on the Web, then these questions can be
critical to your overall business success, not just your Web site’s success.
For example, if you find that a number of other sites have similar products or
a similar focus to what you had in mind for your site, you may consider not
building a site at all or changing the focus of the products you are selling.
What Drives People to the Web
What kinds of services, you may be wondering, are people looking for on the
Internet? Six years ago, the Internet was largely a research medium, meaning
that people would hit the Internet to try to find information about something
fairly academic or obscure. This is not surprising, given that universities
were the first groups to start putting their content online.
Today, the number of reasons people head to the Internet has grown dra-
matically, and includes the following:
✦To research, compare, and purchase products
✦To find and interact with other people (business colleagues, friends,
romantic interests)
✦To get daily news and information delivered in real time
✦To search for and find information about any topic or organization of
interest
✦To deliver and promote their own messages and products to others on
the Web
✦To watch or listen to events, online and otherwise, delivered in a variety
of audio and video formats
✦To educate themselves via online classes and enrollment in universities
✦To play games and entertain themselves
✦To complete all sorts of personal and professional tasks that can now be
done securely online, such as online banking, personal finance, invest-
ing, tax submission, travel, donating, and procurement
These items run the gamut of professional and personal, and they cross
demographic lines. What is common among most online users, though, is that
they begin their online usage with a focused purpose, and that focus then
bleeds over into surfing for things that interest them throughout the Web.

Choosing the Right Type of Web Site

Choosing the Right Type of Web Site
For all its diversity in content, the Internet really doesn’t have that many dif-
ferent types of Web sites. Why do so many Web sites look alike? The main
reason is that people want their sites to be easy to use, free (or close to it),
and similar to other sites they’ve seen or experienced. This has resulted in
the emergence of some standard types of Web sites. A number of compo-
nents for these sites can be found in ColdFusion. Where applicable, we’ve
noted it in the following list. The most common types of sites include:
✦The Product Site: The most common type of site. Generally, the site
offers some basic information about a company, its products, staff 
members, perhaps a product demo, and a way to contact the organiza-
tion to get more information. Examples of this kind of site would be
www.symantec.com, www.amf.com, and www.nadelectronics.com.
✦The Commerce Site: A storefront on the Internet. Whether it’s a single
company that carries just their own specialized products or a retailer that
sells a wide array of products, these sites are geared towards purchasing
products and offering accessories to complement those products. An
example of this kind of site would be www.macys.com. ColdFusion offers
tools that can help you to add a shopping cart, a search function, and
more to your site easily.
✦The Portal Site: A site that aggregates content from a wide variety of
sources. Portal sites tend to be rich in content and links but short on
graphics. The idea is to provide users with a launching pad to other 
destinations on the Internet, though in recent years, many of these 
portals are adding features to try to keep their users on their own site.
An example of this kind of site is www.yahoo.com. ColdFusion includes
robust search capabilities that enable you to have more content-rich
sites that are easily indexed and searched.
✦The News Site: A site that, in general, mirrors an offline counterpart,
such as ABC News. These sites provide a lot of the same information
as their offline counterparts through the use of text, video, audio, and
graphics, and also provide services geared towards the online audience,
such as chat sessions, newsletters, and personalized content. An exam-
ple of this kind of site would be www.cnn.com. ColdFusion includes
tools for adding chat to your site as well.
✦The Application Site: A type of site that offers perhaps the greatest 
diversity of all the sites. Application sites are geared towards a specific
purpose, such as banking, investing, automobile purchasing, travel plan-
ning, photo galleries, event planning, or online greetings. Some of the
commonalities among these sites include user accounts, password pro-
tection, and the widespread use of e-mail campaigns to try to keep users
coming back. Examples of this kind of site include www.egreetings.com,
www.imotors.com, and www.bankofamerica.com.

Macromedia Studio MX 2004: Your Ally in Development
14
✦The Personal Site: Personal sites also offer a great deal of variety in
their design and function. Personal sites usually include some of the
designer’s work, opinions, and rants; links to other sites; and pictures.
Examples of this kind of site would be www.loungeboy.com and
www.katswindow.net.
Macromedia Studio MX 2004:
Your Ally in Development
After you’ve answered a number of the questions in the “Finding Your Place
on the Web” section, you may be wondering how you’re going to build your
grand Web site. Well, don’t fret. With Macromedia Studio, you have the most
complete, user-friendly, and popular development suite on the market. Even
though professionals use these products all the time, the programs in the
Macromedia Studio suite are truly designed for the first-time Web developer.
With an array of tutorials, wizards, and interfaces that keep you as distant
from the code as you want to be, Macromedia Studio makes the Herculean
task of building powerful Web applications seem like just another project.
The goal with Macromedia Studio is to help you, the developer, build com-
pelling and powerful Web sites in the shortest amount of time, while simulta-
neously helping you alleviate cost and resource issues common to Web
development. Macromedia Studio includes several tools to help make this
happen:
✦Dreamweaver MX 2004: The premier tool for easily building Web pages.
In recent versions, it has been combined with ColdFusion to make devel-
oping dynamic Web applications much easier.
✦Fireworks MX 2004: A leading tool for the graphical development of a
site. Fireworks helps you design the look and feel of your site, as well as
prepare the graphics for inclusion in an HTML or CFML file.
✦Macromedia Flash MX 2004: The world’s most popular tool for adding
animation and sound to Web sites. Macromedia Flash will truly change
the way any site works.
✦FreeHand MX: The Web developer’s best friend for creating illustrations
for Fireworks and Macromedia Flash.
✦ColdFusion MX 6.1 Developer Edition: Give yourself the powerful tools
to add databases, e-mail servers, and other dynamic elements to your
site. ColdFusion allows you to take control of one of the most powerful —
but also easy to learn — scripting languages for the development of com-
pelling Web applications.

✦Contribute 2: Collaborate with others and take all the development
hassle out of building (and maintaining) Web sites with Contribute.
Using this tool in combination with Dreamweaver will help you design
Web sites in such a way that just about anyone in your organization
who can use a word processing program will be able to add and modify
content on the site.
Before You Start: Things to Know
Hopefully, all this information hasn’t scared you into dropping this book and
deciding to open a lemonade stand instead. This last section is just a quick
check of some things you should be aware of before you jump into this ven-
ture called Web development:
✦Plan ahead. Building a Web site always takes longer than you think, so
give yourself more time than you originally planned for!
✦Get organized. Remember to categorize your content and use those
categories as the initial architecture for your site when you’re doing the
user interface design.
✦Always do the user interface design before the graphics design. The
user interface design specifies how your site will work, while the graphi-
cal design is the look and feel. If you do the graphics before the architec-
ture is done, you’ll likely end up redoing a lot of your design after you’ve
figured out how your site is going to work.
✦Not all browsers are the same. Internet Explorer and Netscape
Navigator are the two most common browsers, and in recent versions,
they’ve adopted the same standards. But there are still quirky differ-
ences between the two browsers, and you have to check your work on
both browsers.
✦Not all platforms are the same. If only they were! Explorer and Navigator
work slightly differently on the Mac, in Windows, and in Unix. If you’re
developing on the PC, find a friend or a graphic designer with a Mac
and check your work on her system as well. Dreamweaver also includes
some tools to help you verify whether your site will work the way you
hope it does on a variety of platforms.
✦Learn from sites you like. If you like the way a page looks — but can’t
imagine how such a design could have been translated to the Web —
you can view the source code in your browser to see how the page was
constructed. Seeing how other people have coded their pages can spur
you on to create your own unique designs.

Before You Start: Things to Know
16
✦Lots of stuff can be had for free. The Web is filled with geeks like us
who have made all sorts of crazy applications, like chat engines, bulletin
boards, and even wholesale applications. A lot of them can be had for
free or something close to it. This is where sites like www.google.com
and www.download.com can be your friends.
✦Old content equals a dead site. You have to be prepared to update your
site on a semi-regular basis. When content is stale, people will notice,
and they will stop coming.
✦If you build it, tell someone. It’s one thing to build a site. Site-search
spiders will eventually find you, but if you really want to be seen, then
you really need to promote yourself. When you’re done building,
remember, it’s time to start promoting.
✦Don’t be afraid to ask. Building sites can be fun, but it can be especially
frustrating if you can’t figure out how to do something. Well, here’s a
secret: Developers like to talk about what they do. So if you’re stuck, try
finding a user group or searching the Web for an answer to your ques-
tion. Someone may have come across the problem before, and if they
haven’t, then there are plenty of resources for the asking. Macromedia
is also very good about supporting these kinds of groups, so you can
always check out its Web site at www.macromedia.com for listings of
developer resources.

Chapter 2: Developing
Web Content
In This Chapter
 Developing content: An overview
 Categorizing Web content
 Organizing your content
 Creating your content
 Prepping your content for the Web
O
ne of the things you find out when you do Web development for a living
is that the Internet is all about repetition. No matter how many sites
you build, the discussion always begins with “So, what’s the content gonna
be for this site?” Usually, the response is a blank stare. Companies, organiza-
tions, and individuals usually come to the conclusion that they need a Web
site long before they’ve thought about what should be on that site.
Some basic rules of content development are common to all Web sites. This
chapter gives you the basics to consider as you’re doing perhaps the most
important part of building your Web site: contemplating, designing, and cre-
ating your content.
Developing Content: A Four-Step Process
Developing your content strategy can be the best part of building a Web site
because it’s the one time you can sit around a table with your fellow col-
leagues (or your trusty pet, if you’re building a personal site) and truly be
creative about the kinds of things you want on your Web site. When you’re
in the throes of development, you may find yourself uttering: “Remember
when we thought this was a good idea!”
Content development follows a fairly structured course in the modern world
of Web design. It usually includes the following four basic steps:
1. Brainstorm the types of information that you want to include on your
Web site.
2. Put that information into categories that make sense for the type of Web
site you’re building and the way you want users to interact with the site.

Choosing and Organizing Content
18
3. Gather and create the content for the site.
4. Prepare your content for the Web.
A great temptation is to just start building a site the moment something cool
comes along, be it an idea, a graphic, or even words. The reason to do all
this planning before even cracking any HTML code in Dreamweaver or gen-
erating any graphics in Fireworks is to make sure that you don’t get too far
down the path of development and suddenly find yourself backed into a
corner, trying to put content where it doesn’t really belong.
Choosing and Organizing Content
You may be wondering just what, exactly, is considered content. Here’s a
little content quiz consisting of three simple yes or no questions:
1. Is a mailing list sign-up form, as shown in Figure 2-1, considered content?
2. Is a downloadable file considered content?
3. Is a picture of a product, or even of your pet ferret, considered content?
The answer to all these questions is yes. In practical terms, every single
thing you put on a Web site is considered content.
Figure 2-1:
Hmm . . .

Classifying common types of Web content
The fact that everything is content doesn’t really help you get your site
organized. Thankfully, while anything can be content, things tend to show
up on Web sites in some pretty common formats.
As you begin to think about what you want to put on your Web site, you
should also consider the different forms that you want that content to take.
To give you a kick-start, Table 2-1 includes the most common forms of con-
tent and the data that makes up that content.

Categorizing your content
In addition to organizing your content by its file type, assigning meaningful
categories to your content makes developing your site infinitely easier. You
can organize your content in any way that makes logical sense for the site
you’re building. Most of the time, a single piece of content can be catego-
rized in more than one way, so don’t worry about limiting yourself to just
one classification method.
The following list includes some of the most common ways to categorize
content:
✦Organizing by concept: This varies from site to site, but this method
entails organizing your site by the major thematic elements, as defined
by the content that you’re going to be putting up. An example of this is
organizing a company site around the various products it offers.
✦Classifying by function: Functions are things you can do on a site and
can serve as organizing principles for your site. For example, a financial
services company may categorize its content around a series of investing

and banking tools. In fact, that financial services company may choose
to categorize its content not only by the tools on the site (functions) but
also by the various products it offers (concepts), which demonstrates
that there’s more than one way to slice content.
✦Categorizing by logical steps: Some sites dispense with the notion of
concepts or functions altogether and focus on tasks that get something
done. Online auto sites, for example, like to walk visitors through a series
of steps to find the car they’re looking for, offering related content at
appropriate points along the way.
✦Sorting by topics or keywords: Sites with a diverse array of content
tend to offer users a couple of ways of getting at information. Keywords
(topics) are a common way to associate content with more than one
area of interest. For example, a music store may organize its site by con-
cepts such as instruments, sheet music, and accessories, and sort the
content by topics such as pianos, drums, guitars, amplifiers, and flutes,
to name just a few.
✦Arranging hierarchically: This method of categorization assumes
that some content elements are more important than others, which
is reflected in how the content is displayed on the site. Hierarchy is
often used in conjunction with another categorization scheme. To go
back to the banking example for a moment, imagine that you’ve got
your portfolio online. Usually, your portfolio is organized by concept
or function, as well as by hierarchy. The portfolio is given more promi-
nence than the other products the bank sells, because the folks at the
bank know that the content in the portfolio is more important to
the user.
✦Grouping by type: As noted in the previous section, content type is
the other major way to categorize content. On a number of media sites,
such as the ABC News site (www.abcnews.com), you can easily find all
the video content in a single location, in addition to being able to get
your news by feature area.
Creating Content for the Web
If you’ve got the right tools, creating content for the Web is a breeze. And
because you’ve got a copy of Macromedia Studio MX 2004, you’ve already
got a host of tools that can help you create all sorts of content for your site.
To recap, here is a list of some of the content you can create with the prod-
ucts in the Macromedia Studio suite:
✦Fireworks MX 2004: Create quality photorealistic graphics that can be
used in Dreamweaver or Macromedia Flash.

Book I
Chapter 2

Web Content
Creating Content for the Web
21
✦Dreamweaver MX 2004: Create pages from basic HTML to complete
database driven applications, as well as use the publishing tools to help
you maintain your site.
✦FreeHand MX: Make illustrations that can be used to create the look
and feel of your Web site or your Flash movie.
✦Macromedia Flash MX 2004: Create animations that bring your site
to life.
✦ColdFusion MX 6.1 Developer Edition: Create dynamic, database-
driven applications.
✦Contribute 2: Have non-technical colleagues add and modify content on
the site in both the development and maintenance phases of the Web
site’s life.
In addition to these tools, you’ll find that other non-Macromedia software
tools can be essential to generating and managing content:
✦Microsoft Word: Word is the most common word processor in the
world for a reason. When you’re creating text for Web sites, there’s still
no better tool out there than Word for quickly and easily creating text.
✦Adobe Acrobat: The Acrobat PDF format has become the downloadable
document format of choice in the Web world. If you’re going to develop
large, professionally-designed text- and image-heavy documents for the
Web, then investing in the full version of Adobe Acrobat is worth the
money. PDF files ensure that your documents will always have the same
look and feel, regardless of what browser or platform users may have.
Offering PDF files for download will also make your users happy
because they only need to download the free Adobe Acrobat Reader to
read your PDF documents.
✦Microsoft Excel: As a spreadsheet, Excel can serve two very useful pur-
poses. It can help you manage your content by providing you with a
nice tool to manage your categorized data. With Excel, you can also
save data in CSV format, which is the most common data format for
importing into a database. So, for example, if you are providing your
users with a list of the names and addresses of people in your associa-
tion, then you might consider providing the information in CSV format,
so that users can import the contact information directly into their own
address book.
✦Microsoft Access (or equivalent): Access is a database. If you create an
e-commerce site, you’ll find that your product data is best kept in a
database, rather than in plain text. Access is the most commonly avail-
able database (though not necessarily the most robust), and is easily
compatible with ColdFusion.

Prepping Content for the Web
22
Prepping Content for the Web
When preparing your content for delivery to the Web, here are a few handy
tips to keep in mind:
✦Have a plan: If you haven’t gone through the process of content devel-
opment outlined previously in this chapter, your content is likely to be
disorganized. Be sure you have an overview of your content, as well as
an outline that shows all the various formats that your content will take
and how you’re choosing to categorize it.
✦Choose the right format: Take a long, hard look at your content. Are
you using the right format for certain types of content? Are your graph-
ics in acceptable formats, such as GIF and JPEG? Are your downloadable
items in PDF format? Be sure you’re using the commonly accepted Web
file formats, and if you’re not, be sure to create some text to explain why
you’re not using standard formats.
✦Be consistent: The Web relies on developers being at least somewhat con-
sistent. So if you have a product data sheet available in PDF format, make
sure that your other documents are in PDF format. Similarly, try to stick
to the same audio and video formats. That way, when people get to your
site, they’ll know what to expect, and they’re not likely to get frustrated.
✦Make your content more easily digestible: One last thing to keep in
mind: Just because you’ve written the Great American Novel and you
want to put it on the Web doesn’t mean that you should just put the
whole thing up in one huge piece. The Web is made to deliver content in
small chunks, and the best sites give viewers the facts first, and then let
people delve deeper at their leisure. Remember, people are busy, and
they may just need to get the facts quickly. For you as the developer,
this means creating highlights, summaries, thumbnails, or charts that
provide an introduction or an overview to your core content.

You’ve probably heard that old saying, “A craftsman never blames his
tools.” Nowhere is that saying more appropriate than with Macromedia
Studio MX 2004. With six incredibly powerful tools at your fingertips, you
can create compelling and dynamic sites in no time flat.
Of course, even though a craftsman never blames his (or her) tools, a crafts-
man does need to know which tools to use for a given job, and sometimes,
in the world of Web development, that’s not always so clear. This chapter is
designed to clarify this issue by highlighting the do’s and don’ts of each of
the Macromedia Studio products.
If you’re already familiar with the products in Macromedia Studio, then
just take a gander at the following section and then head right to Book I,
Chapter 4.
Before You Begin: When Not to Use
Macromedia Studio MX 2004
Although you certainly can use Macromedia Studio for every bit of your site
development, some things are better done outside the tool suite:
✦Content development and management: This is the process of develop-
ing the written content for the site, as well as managing the collection
and status of each piece of content on the site. Products like Microsoft
Word, WordPerfect, Microsoft Excel, and Microsoft Access are more
appropriate tools for this job.

Using Dreamweaver MX 2004 for Web Development
24
✦Project management: This is the process of managing the steps of
the project from start to finish, as well as where and how to allocate
resources to the project. You may want to use Microsoft Project or
Microsoft Excel to manage your project.
Using Dreamweaver MX 2004 for Web Development
No matter how graphic intensive or dynamic you want your site to be, you’ll
always come back to the fact that you have to build your Web site with
something. In Macromedia Studio, Dreamweaver is the Web development
workhorse. You can use Dreamweaver, shown in Figure 3-1, for a host of
practical Web development tasks:
✦Create and edit HTML or ColdFusion Markup Language code (or code
using ASP, JSP, and the like).
✦Create “Sites” — a confusing Dreamweaver term that means a place
either locally on your computer or on a remote server where you keep
all the content for your Web site. When your content is in a
Dreamweaver Site, you can set up page templates and run various
reports on your site content.
✦Upload all your Web pages from your local computer to a Web server on
the Internet that houses your site.
✦Set up connections between your Web site and a database to make the
site dynamic.
✦Preview your work using Macromedia’s Preview in Browser tools before
you publish it on the Web.
✦Review code for errors and badly formed code.
The best way to think of Dreamweaver is as the glue that binds your site
together. Other Macromedia products like Macromedia Flash and Fireworks
help to add flair and pizzazz to your site, but to actually include the files
that these applications produce in your site requires the HTML and publish-
ing tools that only Dreamweaver offers.
Ultimately, most of your content ends up in an HTML or CFML (ColdFusion)
page (or, depending on your server technology, an ASP, JSP, or other kind
of page), so if you don’t have Microsoft Word or WordPerfect, Dreamweaver
can also be used to create content as you would in a word processing 
program.

Designing with Fireworks MX 2004
Fireworks is easily the most versatile of all the tools in Macromedia Studio.
As shown in Figure 3-2, Fireworks is primarily geared towards creating the
graphical design of your site. With Fireworks, you can accomplish the fol-
lowing tasks:
✦Create graphical elements that make up the look and feel of your site by
using the Fireworks text and editing tools.
✦Apply filters that create photo-quality effects for the imagery in your
site.
✦Manipulate text to be used in graphical elements.
✦Use layers to manage the depth and positioning of elements on the
screen during your graphics development.
✦Slice up your page design into multiple images in preparation for inte-
gration into HTML using Dreamweaver.
✦Use tools to optimize the size and color of images on your site.

ment tasks.

These are just the core elements of Fireworks. In addition to being a power-
ful graphics development tool, Fireworks also incorporates elements of
FreeHand, Dreamweaver, and even Macromedia Flash, providing you with
additional functionality, such as the following:
✦Creating vector images that can be used in Macromedia Flash animations.
✦Creating basic animations and publishing your images as a Flash movie.
✦Creating image rollovers that are common to most sites nowadays using
the scripting language JavaScript.
✦Generating the HTML to accompany your sliced images. Within the Web
layer in Fireworks, you can divide an image into multiple pieces, each of
which is called a slice. (See Book III, Chapter 6 for more information
about slices.)
All told, you can use Fireworks for a variety of development tasks.
Illustrating with FreeHand MX
At first glance, with the flexibility of Fireworks, you may think that FreeHand
MX is the odd man out in Macromedia Studio. Not true! Although many of the
Figure 3-2:

Chapter 3

tools are identical to those you find in Fireworks, FreeHand offers illustrators
and Flash animation developers a greater degree of control and integration in
their work.
Some of the things that distinguish FreeHand (shown in Figure 3-3) from
Fireworks include the following:
✦A wider array of line art creation and manipulation tools
✦Greater control of styles
✦Better color management tools
✦Increased integration with Macromedia Flash
✦More import and export options
These distinctions may seem a bit subtle, and to some degree, they are.
However, when you get down to the nuts and bolts of building Macromedia
Flash animations, for example, you’ll see that FreeHand provides nearly
seamless integration with the product, offering you a more diverse palette
for developing compelling animations.

After you’ve got a few Web sites under your belt, you may find that HTML
and graphics alone seem lifeless. Sure, they’re necessary, but soon you’ll
begin to wonder what else you can do to add some pizzazz to your sites.
That’s where Macromedia Flash comes in. Macromedia Flash enables you
to add animation, sound, and interactivity to your site.
Macromedia Flash, shown in Figure 3-4, can radically change the way your
site works. Macromedia Flash allows you to create a more compelling user
experience. Gone are the boundaries created by HTML and limited graphics.
Although you still need help from the other Macromedia Studio products,
you can think of Macromedia Flash as an entirely new development platform
for building your site.
In order to view the Flash movies you create, visitors to your site will need
to have the Flash plug-in installed in their browser. Luckily, almost everyone
with a standard graphical Web browser like Internet Explorer, Netscape
Navigator, or Safari has some version of the Flash plug-in installed.

Managing Your Site with Contribute 2
29
Creating a Dynamic Site with ColdFusion 
MX 6.1 Developer Edition
Static HTML only gets you so far with Web development. After you’ve built
that first-generation site, you may soon find that your Web site development
needs have grown and you require more out of your development tools. What
do we mean by more? Well, imagine you want to do any of the following:
✦Customize the content of a site based on how a visitor got there.
✦Personalize the site by letting users choose their own content.
✦Open a store on the Internet with a host of product information con-
tained in databases.
✦Create interactivity in your site through the use of forms.
All these items go beyond what Dreamweaver or Macromedia Flash can pro-
vide as development tools. After you hit this proverbial Web development
wall, it’s time to turn to ColdFusion, which provides the following tools:
✦A custom scripting language that enables you to query databases, create
and test variables, and extend the functionality of your site through the
use of specific ColdFusion tags and functions. For more information
about ColdFusion’s scripting language, be sure to check out Book VI.
✦An application server (a program on a computer that serves a specific
function) that reads the custom scripting language and turns it into HTML
that people can see in their browser.
✦An administrative component that enables you to configure all the dif-
ferent elements of your site, such as databases, virtual directories, log
files that capture site tracking information, and e-mail features.
Managing Your Site with Contribute 2
By adding Contribute 2 to the Macromedia Studio family, Macromedia pro-
vides developers with a new tool to help them manage the content on their
sites. Designed for the lay person, Contribute allows you to manage a handful
of Web development tasks quickly and easily, including:
✦Creating and editing Web pages on a site
✦Adding images and links to a page
✦Creating tables and text
✦Publishing pages to a Web site

Managing Your Site with Contribute 2
30
Now, you may be thinking that sounds an awful lot like what you do with
Dreamweaver. In fact, Contribute, in a nutshell, is a tool that allows users to
accomplish Dreamweaver-like tasks without jeopardizing any of the underly-
ing code structure of a Web site. That goes for both site development and
site maintenance.
During the development phase, if your site has many pages that share an
identical design but need different content, the HTML developer can create
a Dreamweaver template of the design, and non-technical colleagues can
create multiple pages based on the template using Contribute, each page
with its own content but all with a protected common layout.
When the site is up and running, Contribute allows people with no knowl-
edge of HTML to make changes to content on the site. And built-in safe-
guards prevent two (or more) people from making changes to the same page
at the same time.

T
he late-night, caffeine-fueled, build-it-as-you-go model of Web development
was fine when the industry was just getting started. However, Web devel-
opment today is a more standardized practice and is subject to repeatable
processes, just like other areas of software development. The result of the
growing maturity in the industry is a set of “best practices” for Web develop-
ment. Think of a best practice as an industry-accepted, commonly-agreed-upon
way of performing a task or set of tasks.
Certainly, you can still build a Web site in more than one way. Best practices
are designed just to give you some guidance in the following areas:
✦Ensuring that the site is easy to build and easier to maintain
✦Helping you avoid doing unnecessary work on a site
✦Confirming that your Web site is built according to industry standards
✦Making certain that you have the right people involved in the site devel-
opment at the right time
Each of the sections of this chapter deals with a common aspect of Web
development and provides you with the key points for making that part of
the development run smoothly.
You should be aware that these tips and suggestions are not absolutes.
Every site is a bit different, but you can use this chapter as a checklist guide
for the kinds of things you can do. Your site may require more or less atten-
tion depending on your requirements.

Following the Best Path of Development
32
Additionally, this chapter is limited to the general best practices for devel-
oping sites. Each of the chapters within Book II through Book VII covers the
best way to perform operations with each of the individual Macromedia
Studio MX 2004 products.
Following the Best Path of Development
The early days of Web sites saw a wide variety of methods and approaches to
development, but today most common types of Web sites follow an accepted
path from start to finish. Building a Web site takes six basic steps. The details
within each step can be specific to the type of site you’re building — product
site, e-commerce site, and so on — but the basic steps remain the same.
Step one: Develop a site concept
Before you can build a site, you must have a mission and purpose for it. This
process involves asking yourself and your colleagues a number of questions
about whom you’re trying to reach and why. Book I, Chapter 1 includes
more information on this process.
Step two: Define your requirements
After you’ve decided what your site is all about, you need to come up with
some basic requirements for the site. Requirements are the minimum stan-
dards that the site must conform to. These requirements break out along
the following categories:
✦Feature requirements: The basic set of site features and what those fea-
tures need to accomplish.
✦Technical requirements: The minimum technical specifications for the
site. Table 4-1 includes the common technical requirements for Web sites.
✦Design requirements: The aesthetic and accessibility requirements for
the site. Design requirements may include things such as using the
proper corporate colors, and accessibility requirements generally
include things like adding a text-only version of a site so that it can be
read by text readers (browsers designed for the visually impaired).

Step three: Generate content
During this step, you work to generate the various types of text, images, and
so on that will make up the content of your site. Book I, Chapter 2 covers the
details of generating content for Web sites.
Step four: Design the site
This step covers four different aspects of design, and in general, they follow
this sequence:
1. Complete the feature design.
In the second step of Web site development, you set out the requirements
for features on the site. Here, you get down to the nitty-gritty and design
exactly how those features will work. For example, if you want to collect
mailing list information, you need to articulate precisely how the informa-
tion is captured, what kind of response is sent to a user, and where the
captured information goes.
2. Work through the user interface design.
The user interface design is the way the site works, minus the aesthet-
ics. It includes the composition of pages, the structure and look of the
content, and it applies the logic of the feature design above.
3. Consider the graphics design.
After the feature and user interface design are complete, your site is
ready for the aesthetics. You may want to create graphics for logos,
icons, navigation, sidebars, backgrounds, and other site elements.
4. Complete the technical design of the site.
Truth be told, you can do the technical design after you complete the
user interface design, but usually it ends up being the last design step.
You must design the technical components that enable all the features
of the site to be realized.

Following the Best Path of Development
34
Step five: Build the site
After you’ve completed the design step, you’re ready to start building the
site. This includes generating all the code, supporting databases, generating
HTML, and posting content. Building the site can take weeks, and you
should keep a number of basic rules of development in mind when building
your site. Here are the most critical ones:
✦Work internally. Don’t do all your development work on the site for
everyone to see. Be sure to work on the site either internally (on your
corporate network or your personal machine) or on a different URL
than the final address. This way you can make all the mistakes you like
and the real world isn’t likely to see them.
✦Go wide, then deep. A good strategy is to always build the structure of
the site first, including the navigation, and then fill it in with the content
within individual sections. Figure 4-1 shows the navigational structure
of a typical site, with primary navigation running across the top and
secondary navigation running down the left. Primary navigation allows
visitors to get to the main sections of the site, while secondary naviga-
tion allows visitors to “drill down” to specific pages in the section.
✦Centralize your images. Centralizing your images makes finding images
and generating the proper code that much easier. The norm is to include
all images in a folder called images at the root level of your site.
Figure 4-1:
The typical
inverted
L shape
of a site’s
navigation.

Book I
Chapter 4
Best Practices for
Web Development
Following the Best Path of Development
35
✦Whenever possible, use relative paths. Using a relative path simply
means that your links from one file to another within your site — HTML
files, images, PDFs, and so on — are relative to the location of the file
you’re currently working on. This makes changing links and moving
things around in folders that much easier. Dreamweaver defaults to
using relative paths. An absolute path (for example, http://www.
mysite.com/section/page.htm) includes the site’s URL, which is
not only cumbersome but also difficult to use during development.
✦Keep filenames simple. Always keep your filenames in lowercase letters,
and don’t include spaces in filenames, folder names, or URLs. This
ensures that no matter what type of Web server your site is hosted 
on — Windows, Macintosh, or Unix — the files can be read by any Web
browser.
✦Use folders to segment your content. This provides your site with a
structure that makes finding and managing your content and code
easier.
✦Always comment your code. Commenting code is a common software
development practice. As you’re writing your code, you add comments
next to major features and functions so that someone else can under-
stand your work if you’re not there to explain it to them. Browsers
ignore comments when displaying the page (but you can see com-
ments, if they’re in the code, by using your browser’s View Source 
command). If the code is logically laid out with comments, managing
it is much easier. Figure 4-2 shows what commented code looks like in
Dreamweaver MX 2004. HTML comments always appear in this format:
<!-- comment here -->. JavaScript, ColdFusion, and other types of
Web code each have their own comment conventions.
Figure 4-2:

Following the Best Path of Development
36
✦Do everything you can to protect your applications. Hacking is serious
business, and the last thing you want to have happen is for your site to
be compromised. Here are just some of the things you can do to ensure
that your site is designed with security in mind:
• Always use digital certificates when sending users private information
over the Internet. A digital certificate is a secure, encrypted digital key
that ensures that only the user’s Web browser and the server that
issued the key can see the data being transmitted back and forth. You
can find out more about digital certificates at www.verisign.com.
• If you’re doing e-commerce, don’t use Microsoft Access. Access isn’t
nearly as secure as Microsoft’s SQL Server.
• Never query a database directly for a user’s private information, such
as username, password, or credit card numbers. With SQL, you can use
stored procedures to query a database and mask the code from poten-
tial hackers. While stored procedures are outside the scope of this
book, you can read more about them in Anthony T. Mann’s Microsoft
SQL Server 2000 For Dummies, published by Wiley Publishing, Inc.
• Always try to build your applications in three tiers. A three-tiered
application, the concept of which is shown in Figure 4-3, ensures
that the business logic for your site is separate from your display
code and your database logic. This is more secure, and it makes
changing components of your Web application easier because of the
modular nature of a three-tiered application.
In the three-tiered model, the Web browser can only talk to an inter-
mediary application or object (sometimes called a COM object) and
can only pass a finite set of variables to this intermediary. In turn,
the intermediary negotiates with the data layer to retrieve only the
specified information, which it passes back to the display layer. This
ensures that the end user can’t directly connect to the data layer.
✦Set up a mechanism for sharing files. When you’re working on the same
files with more than one person, set up a convention for sharing the files,
so as to avoid overwriting each other’s work. Dreamweaver comes with
some source control tools that help in this process, as does Contribute,
but you may not want to rely just on their built-in protections. You
should have an agreed-upon procedure for working on the same files.
Step six: Test and deploy your site
Before you can launch your site, you need to test it. Although test plans
vary depending upon the sophistication of the site, here are four good
things you should do when testing your site:

Book I
Chapter 4
Best Practices for
Web Development
Following the Best Path of Development
37
✦Check your site on multiple browsers. Testing your site on various cur-
rent and previous versions of browsers ensures that it works for the
largest possible number of users. You should also check on different
platforms as well (PC and Mac at the least).
You can get old versions of the Netscape browser at http://wp.
netscape.com/download/archive.html?cp=dowarc and old versions
of Internet Explorer at www.oldversion.com/program.php?n=msie.
You can find a wide variety of old versions of many browsers at
http://browsers.evolt.org.
✦Try your site with different Web connections of varying download
speeds. If you’re building your site at work, you may have a very fast
Internet connection. Try viewing and navigating your site using a dial-up
56 Kbps connection to see how well your site loads at that speed. If
pages load within a few seconds, then your site is in good shape.

Getting the Right People at the Right Time
38
✦Test all of your forms and features. Walk through each form, again
preferably on multiple browsers and operating systems, to ensure that
all your tools and forms work properly.
✦Enlist your friends and colleagues as site testers. The more people that
look at your site, the better. You’re probably too close to the site by the
time you’ve finished it anyway, and fresh eyes can see things you can’t.
Also, other people are likely to give you good feedback on structure and
ease of use.
After you’ve finished testing your site, which generally takes at least a week,
you should give yourself at least another week to fix any problems you’ve
found during the testing phase.
When you’re ready to roll out your site, a good idea is to do a soft launch
first. A soft launch is when you launch a site but don’t really tell anyone
about it. People who already know something about you or may be looking
for your site will start to check it out and may provide you with some addi-
tional feedback. But you won’t be faced with a big barrage of people, and
you’ll have a chance to troubleshoot anything you may have overlooked in
making the jump from working on a site internally to having a site out there
live for the real world.
Getting the Right People at the Right Time
If you’re building a site on your own, then you are always the right person at
the right time. In most cases, however, you’re building a site with a group of
people. Some of these people are site builders, and others are around to
approve content and give general direction. Keeping all the parts moving
smoothly can be tricky. The following sections help you get the right people
on board at the right time.
Building a team
Just how big is this project you’re working on? How much money do you
have to spend? When do you need it done? The answers to these three ques-
tions let you know just how big of a team you may need to build to complete
your site. If you plan to assemble an internal team to build your site, these
are the roles that you absolutely need:
✦Producer: Perhaps this is you. The producer (sometimes also referred
to as a Project Manager) manages all the resources of the project, inter-
nal and external. This means keeping the master budget and schedule,
and providing all the resources with their tasks and deadlines. Largely

39
overlooked, the producer is the conduit that keeps the project moving
from start to finish.
✦Programmer: Programmers come in all shapes and sizes. Some can
only do HTML, while others are adept at building all sorts of software
applications. If you’ve got a smaller project, you should only need one
programmer (who might also go by the title Engineer or Integrator), but
if your project is larger, you should consider having an integrator for
lower-level HTML coding and a senior programmer for more complex
coding tasks.
✦Designers: Again, if you’re building a smaller site, you can probably get
away with having a designer who does both user interface design and
graphical design. Alternatively, as the producer, you’re probably quali-
fied to handle the user interface duties as well as fill the feature design
role. The larger the site, the more you’d want to look at separate spe-
cialists for user interface and graphical design.
✦Content Specialists: Generating content is always overlooked in build-
ing a team. Whether you have a contract writer or someone internal to
your organization who is good at collecting and synthesizing data, it’s
always a good idea to have someone around dedicated to developing
content for the site.
✦Quality Assurance: Someone’s gotta test the site, and as we mention
previously, you’re probably not the ideal person to do it. The best
testers are meticulous, accountant-types who like to poke and prod at
things and find holes. A lot of times, this function can be contracted out.
✦Approvers: Unless you’re building the site for yourself, then you’re
probably accountable to someone. Those would be your approvers, and
yes, they’re an essential part of the team, because ultimately, they are
the ones who give you the yea or nay on whether your site gets up on
the Internet!
If you were to contract out these resources through a single firm or through
a variety of independent contractors, you’d still be looking for each of these
skill sets. The method of employment doesn’t really matter, though it’s
worth noting that it’s generally cheaper to contract the resources yourself.
Firms, on the other hand, offer complete teams, tried-and-true processes,
and an existing code base (prewritten and tested code) that you don’t gen-
erally get when you build an internal team from scratch.

Getting the Right People at the Right Time
40
Involving the right people at the right time
Knowing when to get people involved can be tricky. Ideally, you’d want
everyone there all the time, but that can get expensive, so you want to get
people on board at the right time for the right tasks. Table 4-2 includes
many of the key milestones in a Web development project and who you
really need to have involved during those parts of the process.

f you’re looking for a Web design tool that’s both easy enough for begin-
ners and sophisticated enough for Web design gurus, you’ve come to the
right place. Dreamweaver MX 2004 from Macromedia is a powerful program
that enables you to create almost any type of Web page. This chapter covers
the Dreamweaver basics and introduces you to some of the program’s
essential tools.
Dreamweaver is the industry standard for Web site design and production.
Whether you’re interested in creating a site for fun, such as an online photo
album or a site devoted to one of your hobbies, or for business, such as an
online store, Dreamweaver’s flexible interface provides simultaneous graphi-
cal and HTML editing. In other words, using Dreamweaver, you can not only
lay out pages like an artist, you can also fine-tune the associated code like a
programmer. Additionally, Dreamweaver’s built-in FTP features enable you
to upload your site to the Web in a snap, so that you can share your master-
pieces with the world.
Exploring the New Dreamweaver MX 2004 Interface
With Dreamweaver MX, Macromedia integrated ColdFusion and HomeSite
into one single, powerful interface, though you had the choice of working
with that new interface or with the old Dreamweaver 4 interface (or,
in Macromedia parlance, workspace). With Dreamweaver MX 2004,

Exploring the New Dreamweaver MX 2004 Interface
44
Macromedia dropped the Dreamweaver 4 workspace and allows you to
choose from only two versions of the Dreamweaver workspace: Designer
style and HomeSite/Coder-Style.
Selecting a workspace on start-up
When you start Dreamweaver for the first time, you’re asked to choose the
way you want your workspace set up, as shown in Figure 1-1. You have two
options:
✦Designer: The WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) interface,
which shows the page you are working on much like it would be in a
Web browser. This style is more appropriate for Web design novices
working on basic HTML pages.
✦HomeSite/Coder-Style: The style that shows the page you are working
on as an editable text document, which is appropriate for experienced
coders and for pages on which you’re editing ColdFusion Markup
Language (CFML) or other dynamic code.
You can switch between the two styles, or even combine them, at the click
of a button. See the “Introducing the Document Window” section, later in
this chapter, for details.
Introducing the new Start page
After you’ve selected a workspace, when you launch Dreamweaver by
double-clicking its icon on the desktop or by selecting it from the Windows
Start menu, you’ll see something new to Dreamweaver: a Start page, as
shown in Figure 1-2. The Start page allows you to perform the following
tasks with a single click of your mouse:

✦Open pages you’ve recently edited: Simply click the file name of the
page you want to open.
✦Create a new page in one of seven formats: Simply click the type of
page you want to create, from basic HTML to ColdFusion (CFML) to CSS
(Cascading Style Sheet).
✦Create a new Dreamweaver Site: Click the Dreamweaver Site icon (in
the Create New column) to open the Site Definition wizard, which guides
you through the process of setting up the directory location, FTP infor-
mation, server technology (if applicable), and more for your Web site.
See Book II, Chapter 3 for details on Dreamweaver Sites.
✦Create a new page based on Dreamweaver’s built-in samples: Click an
option in the Create from Samples column to open the New Document
dialog box and choose from the preset formatting options for that type
of page.
The Start page also gives you fast access to a quick tour and set of tutorials
for Dreamweaver, and to Macromedia’s Dreamweaver Exchange page, where
you can find lots of nifty widgets that extend Dreamweaver’s capabilities.
If you find the Start page incompatible with your working methods, you can
prevent it from appearing in the future by selecting the Don’t Show Again
check box at the lower-left corner of the page.

Introducing the Document Window
46
Introducing the Document Window
Your primary workspace in Dreamweaver is the Document window, which
appears automatically when you open a page in Dreamweaver. In the
Document window, you construct your individual Web pages using panels
and dialog boxes to format your work. The three primary views in
Dreamweaver are as follows:
✦Design view: The graphical view of your document, as shown in
Figure 1-3. You can select this view by choosing View➪Design.
✦Code view: This view shows the underlying code of your document. You
can select this view by choosing View➪Code.
✦Split view: As you may expect, this is a split screen view that includes
both the Code and Design windows. You can select this view by choos-
ing View➪Code and Design.
You can toggle between these views easily at any time by clicking their cor-
responding buttons at the top left of the Document window.

Choosing among Standard, Expanded Table, and Layout Modes
47
When you have several documents open in a site, you can select which doc-
ument you want to work on by clicking the document’s name at the top of
the Dreamweaver Document window. You can also click the Site tab in the
Files panel to work on an entire site.
The Insert bar sits directly underneath Dreamweaver’s main menu. It gives
you quick access to eight sets of buttons you can use to insert everything
from tables to Flash movies to form elements in your page. To select one of
the eight categories, click the Insert bar’s name (Common, Layout, and so
on) and choose a new category from the drop-down list.
Choosing among Standard, Expanded
Table, and Layout Modes
You can view content in your Document window using the Standard mode,
the Expanded Table mode, or the Layout mode. The Standard mode is the
default (Figure 1-3 shows a page in Standard mode, with the Insert bar set to
Common). The Expanded Table mode makes it easier for you to select
tables and cells (though if you want to resize the table or row or column,
you need to do so in Standard mode). The Expanded Table mode is most
useful for editing existing tables. The Layout mode provides a simpler inter-
face for drawing and editing tables and table cells.
Two special tools are available only when working in Layout mode: the Draw
Layout Cell button and the Draw Layout Table button. A table created with
the Draw Layout Table tool is shown in Figure 1-4. Both of these tools can
help you generate tables or table cells quickly and easily in Dreamweaver,
and are described in more detail in Book II, Chapter 2.
To change to the Layout mode, select the Layout Insert bar at the top left of
the Document window and click the Layout Mode button, or choose View➪
Table Mode➪Layout Mode, or use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+F6. When
you’re in Layout mode, press Ctrl+F6 or click the Layout Mode button to
return to Standard mode.
To change to Expanded Table mode, select the Layout Insert bar at the top
left of the Document window and click the Expanded Table Mode button at
the top of the Document window, or choose View➪Table Mode➪Expanded
Table Mode, or use the keyboard shortcut F6. When you’re in Expanded
Table mode, press F6 or click the Expanded Table Mode button to return to
Standard mode. Note: The Expanded Table mode is not available in the Code
View.

Examining Your Site with the Files Panel
48
Examining Your Site with the Files Panel
Dreamweaver offers Web developers the opportunity to work on individual
files that make up a Web site, as well as to manage their entire Web site, all
through the Dreamweaver interface. This concept is called, not surprisingly,
a Site; to avoid confusion, we call them Dreamweaver Sites. Dreamweaver
Sites can include the following elements:
✦HTML, CFM, ASP, and other files that make up the code of the site
✦Graphics, such as GIF and JPEG files
✦Documents, such as PDF files and DOC files
✦Directories (folders that might contain any of the above)
Dreamweaver Sites are initially viewable within the Files panel (which is
open by default; if the Files panel is not open, you can open it by pressing
F8). To expand the Files panel so it fills your screen, or to collapse the panel
back to panel size, click the Expand/Collapse button (the icon of the two-
row, two-column box with an arrow in the middle, at the right of the panel).
The Web site management tools for Dreamweaver Sites are designed to give
you total control over the way in which your Web site is built and main-
tained from your local computer. The key features of the Dreamweaver Site
tools include:
Figure 1-4:

49
✦Asset management tools that help you manage all the files that make up
your site. For example, these tools keep track of all your files and the
links between files. Anytime you move a file, the tools will change the
related links in other files.
✦Basic source control to ensure that files don’t get overwritten. These
tools lock files so that when you’re working on a particular file, others
on your team can’t edit that same file.
✦Publishing tools that allow you to use FTP to upload the content from
your site locally to the remote server where the site is housed.
✦Utilities that create site maps, check links, check the HTML code, and
run reports on who’s been working on what.
Dreamweaver Sites are covered in more detail in Book II, Chapter 3.
Exploring Toolbar Buttons
Dreamweaver provides you with a number of useful view buttons (shown in
Figure 1-5 and Figure 1-6) that you can use to see different views of your site
or to perform various functions. You can easily switch among views to
examine your site in different ways. Each Dreamweaver view offers special-
ized menus and tools to help you perform your work in that view. Certain
views are available for an individual document or page, whereas other views
are available for the entire site. At any time while you work, you can choose
to preview your site in target Web browsers, which enables you to see your
site from the user’s perspective.

Some of these items may be unavailable, depending on what view you’re in
and what you have selected in a document or panel.
Using Panels and Inspectors
You can use Dreamweaver panels and inspectors to enter details about all
aspects of your Web site. These interfaces offer areas where you can add
and format page features, set up navigation and behaviors, and manage the
workflow of building your site.
Understanding the role of panels
A panel typically provides information about all instances of a particular
page feature. For example, the Layers panel lists information about all the
layers on the current page.
The Tag Inspector panel gives you easy access to various properties and
behaviors specific to what object you have selected on your page. The Tag
Inspector panel updates continually, depending on what you have selected
on your page (if you have nothing selected on the page, the panel displays
properties and behaviors of the whole page itself, as shown in Figure 1-7).
Note that the Tag Inspector panel’s name reflects the tag being inspected.
To switch among tabs in a panel, just click the tab names.

52
You can dock, expand, and collapse panels. See the section on customizing
your work environment in Book III, Chapter 1 for information on working
with panels.
Working with the Properties panel
The Properties panel, like the Tag Inspector panel, changes based on the
individual document object you have selected on your page and contains
details on attributes of the object. For example, selecting text on a page
opens the Text Property inspector in the Properties panel, where you can
format the size, font, color, link, and other attributes of the text. (Figure 1-4
shows the Properties panel with a Layout Table selected.) To make certain
that the Properties panel is shown below the Document window, choose
Window➪Properties.
The Properties panel has a small down arrow in the lower-right corner,
called an Expander button. Click the button to enlarge the Properties panel
to view additional formatting options. In an expanded Properties panel, click
the small up arrow in the lower-right corner to collapse the panel.
Getting Help
Dreamweaver offers a variety of tools to help you find the answer to virtu-
ally any question you have about the program. The Help tools provide basic
information for beginners, as well as advanced references detailing HTML
and JavaScript code.
You can get help by clicking the Help button — the small question mark —
in the top-right corner of some panels. Similarly, you can open the Options
menu in the top-right corner of any panel and select Help from the list.
You can also access help by using the Help menu located on the main menu.
Just choose Help and then select one of the following options:
✦Getting Started and Tutorials: Gives you quick access to basic informa-
tion to get you up and running quickly, as well as to step-by-step tutori-
als where you can learn by doing.
✦Using Dreamweaver: Provides definitions and itemized steps in per-
forming routine Dreamweaver tasks. It contains Help Contents, Index,
and Search categories.
✦Using ColdFusion: Provides information about coding dynamic sites
using ColdFusion technology.

of the Code panel by clicking the Reference button in the Document
window.
✦Extensions: Provides assistance in performing more advanced
Dreamweaver tasks, especially tasks involving the integration of adjunct
programs, such as Macromedia Flash, with Dreamweaver. This help
option contains nitty-gritty information about application programming
interfaces (APIs) — specific software interfaces that allow you to 
integrate Dreamweaver with databases, the C and Java programming
languages, and much more.
✦Dreamweaver Support Center, and Macromedia Online Forums:
Connects you to the Web, where you can find constantly updated infor-
mation on working with Dreamweaver, answers to Frequently Asked
Questions, and program extensions. You can also join a developer’s
forum, where you can chat with other Dreamweaver users to get (and
give) help.

T
he most significant (and, fortunately, the easiest) process in building a Web
site is creating the individual pages that convey the site’s content. Even if
you plan on creating an ultra-hip site chock full of animation and interactive
forms, you spend the vast majority of your site-building effort constructing
basic Web pages comprised of words and images. This chapter shows you how
to set up, color, and name individual Web pages. You also discover how to add
basic elements, such as text, graphics, and tables, to your pages.
Setting Ruler and Grid Options
in the Document Window
Dreamweaver offers you complete control over how you work in the
Document window by providing two guide tools — rulers and a grid — to
help you lay out your work accurately. You can customize a variety of guide
tool attributes, such as ruler increments and grid snapping, to suit your per-
sonal preferences and speed Web page development.
Here’s a brief look at all your options with rulers and grids:
✦Turning rulers on and off: Using rulers — both horizontal and vertical —
in the Document window can help you measure and position page ele-
ments. Toggle the rulers on and off by choosing View➪Rulers➪Show or
by pressing Ctrl+Alt+R.

Setting Ruler and Grid Options in the Document Window
56
✦Moving and resetting the origin: By default, the origin, or (0,0) 
coordinate, of a Dreamweaver ruler is set to the upper-left corner of
the Document window. You can reposition it to any coordinate in the
Document window by clicking the origin cross hairs and dragging them
to new coordinates, which can be useful if you want to use the rulers to
position elements of a table whose upper-left corner doesn’t sit at (0,0)
in the Document window. Reset the origin to its default position by
choosing View➪Rulers➪Reset Origin.
✦Changing ruler measurement units: You can change the ruler’s measur-
ing increment by choosing View➪Rulers and then choosing Pixels,
Inches, or Centimeters.
✦Viewing the grid: Dreamweaver provides a Document Window grid
that can assist you in visually positioning and aligning page elements.
You can toggle the grid on and off by choosing View➪Grid➪Show Grid
or by using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Alt+G. The grid is shown in
Figure 2-1.
✦Activating and deactivating grid snapping: The Document window grid
offers a snapping feature that causes a layer or Layout table/cell to
automatically align precisely with the snap-to points you define, which
can be useful when you draw, resize, or move a layer (see Book II,
Chapter 5 for the skinny on layers). You can toggle grid snapping on and
off by choosing View➪Grid➪Snap to Grid.

You can adjust how the grid appears in the Document window in the Grid
Settings dialog box. To do so, open the Grid Settings dialog box by choosing
View➪Grid➪Grid Settings and change any (or all) of the attributes that
appear. When you finish, click the Apply button to view the effect of your
changes. Click OK to accept the changes and close the dialog box.
Creating and Opening Pages
You have several ways to create a new page in Dreamweaver:
✦On the Start page, scan through the Create New column and click the
type of page you want to create from scratch.
✦On the Start page, click one of the options in the Create from Samples
column to open the New Document dialog box and make a new page
with many common settings precoded.
✦Choose File➪New or use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+N, which opens the
New Document dialog box, from which you can create pages from
scratch or from templates.
To open an existing page, do any of the following:
✦On the Start page, click the name of the page in the Open Recent column.
✦Double-click the page’s filename in the Files tab of the Files panel.
✦Choose File➪Open or use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+O, which opens
the Open dialog box, which you can use to browse to the page you want
to open.
Adjusting page size
When you design Web pages, you must con-
sider how your target audiences will view them.
People looking at your page may view it at any
number of screen resolutions from 640 x 480 to
1024 x 768 or beyond. Your audience may even
view your pages using WebTV, with a resolution
of 544 x 376. Because pages appear differently
at different resolutions, Dreamweaver offers
you the ability to build your pages for a variety of
monitor resolutions. The higher the resolution,
the larger the workspace in your Document
window.
If you want to size your pages, you must be in the
Design workspace, and your Document window
can’t be maximized in the integrated workspace.
To size your pages, click the Window Size
Indicator (the height by width numbers and
downward-pointing arrow at the bottom right of
the Document window) and select a standard
size — for example, 640 x 480 — from the drop-
down list. (The Selecting Edit Sizes option on the
drop-down list allows you to specify any height
and width dimensions you want.)

Establishing Page Properties
58
Establishing Page Properties
The Page Properties dialog box provides you with control over how several
key page properties appear, including the title of the page, page background
color, link colors, and page margins. Selections apply only to the current
page, not to the entire site. Open a Page Properties dialog box similar to the
one shown in Figure 2-2 by choosing Modify➪Page Properties or by pressing
Ctrl+J. Then make changes to any of the following in each of the five cate-
gories (Appearance, Links, Headings, Title/Encoding, and Tracing Image):
✦Page Font, Font Size, Text Color, Background Color, Background
Image: Choose a font or set of fonts from the Page Font drop-down list;
add a style (bold or italic) if desired. Click the Color box next to each
property and pick a color from the Web safe color palette that appears,
or enter a hexadecimal color code directly in any Color Code text field.
You can also customize your own colors by selecting the color wheel
and entering either RGB values or Hue, Saturation, and Luminosity
values, as shown in Figure 2-3. For more information about using colors
for the Web, see Book III, Chapter 2. Book III, Chapter 3 includes infor-
mation on how to use the color picker to select colors in both
Dreamweaver and Fireworks. For Background image, click the Browse
button to locate the image file that you want to appear as the Document
window background. If the image is smaller than the available back-
ground area, the image is tiled (repeated in a checkerboard fashion, like
floor tiles) to fill the background.
Even if you choose to use a background image, select a complementary
background color — the color shows while the background image is
downloading.

✦Left Margin, Right Margin, Top Margin, and Bottom Margin: Enter
a number (in pixels) in these text fields to set up margins that affect
how your page appears in modern browsers. Enter a whole number
for the number of pixels of buffer space you want between the left,
right, top, and bottom edges of your document and the content of the
document.
✦Link Font and Size, Color for Links, Rollover Links, Visited Links, and
Active Links: Choose a font or set of fonts from the drop-down list; add
a style (bold or italic) if desired. Click the Color box next to each prop-
erty and pick a color from the Web safe color palette that appears, or
enter a hexadecimal color code directly in any Color Code text field.
You can also customize your own colors (see the preceding point on
Text Color).
✦Underline Style: Select an option from the drop-down list.
✦Heading Font, Sizes, and Colors: Choose a font or set of fonts from the
drop-down list; add a style (bold or italic) if desired. For as many of the
six standard HTML heading levels as necessary, select a font size. If you
choose a numeric value, the unit-of-measurement drop-down list to the
right becomes active so you can select an option. Click the Color box
next to each heading and pick a color from the Web safe color palette
that appears, or enter a hexadecimal color code directly in any Color
Code text field. You can also customize your own colors (see the pre-
ceding point on Text Color).
✦Title/Encoding: Enter a page title in the text field. This title appears
in the title bar area of the window both during construction in
Dreamweaver and when the page is viewed in a Web browser. Select
an Encoding format if your site requires the use of non-Western fonts
(Japanese or Cyrillic, for example). If your site is in English, you can
leave the setting at the default, Western European.

✦Tracing Image: Click the Browse button to locate the image file you
want to use as a guide for laying out your Web page in the Document
window. This feature is handy for developers who prefer to mock up
a portion of their Web page design in a graphics program and then 
re-create that design in their Web pages. Tracing images appear in
Dreamweaver only as a pattern to help guide you in creating an
actual Web page; the tracing image never appears on the finished
Web page.
✦Image Transparency: Drag the slider to adjust the visibility level of the
tracing image. At 0 percent, the tracing image is invisible; at 100 per-
cent, the image is completely opaque.
Click the Apply button to view the effect of any property you change. Click
OK to accept your changes and close the Page Properties dialog box.

As we mention in Book II, Chapter 1, Dreamweaver has three different design
views: Design, Code, and Split (Code and Design). The following sections
apply when you’re working in the Design view or Split view of Dreamweaver.
In these views, you can enter and manipulate text on a Web page in
Dreamweaver by using similar procedures to those you use when working
with a word-processing document.
Adding, editing, and deleting text
To enter text on a page, click in the Document window and begin typing.
Your mouse pointer appears as a blinking cursor that moves along with the
text you enter. When you reach the end of a line, the text automatically
wraps to the next line. Dreamweaver automatically adds the associated
code for your new text in the HTML for the page.
To delete text from a page, in the Document window, select the chunk that
you want to delete and press Backspace or Delete on your keyboard.
You can also modify how text appears on a page by editing its font, size,
color, alignment, and other attributes. To modify text in the Document
window, click and drag to select the text you want to modify. The Properties
panel loads the Text Property inspector, as shown in Figure 2-4 (the Tag
Inspector panel also reflects the selection). If the Text Property inspector is
not open, choose Window➪Properties to open it. In the Text Property
inspector, modify any of the following properties:

61
✦Format: From the Format drop-down list, select a default text style.
Heading 1 is the largest style and Heading 6 is the smallest, but none
of the headings correlates with a specific pixel size unless you set it to
do so. Select Paragraph for the basic body text of your pages. Select
Preformatted if you want spaces, tabs, and new lines in a paragraph to
show up in a browser (ordinarily, when you add multiple spaces in a row
or tabs to your HTML — this is particularly obvious in the Dreamweaver
document’s Code view — they appear as single spaces in a browser).
✦Font: Select a font face from the Font drop-down list. Browsers show
your text formatted as the first font in your selection that resides on the
user’s computer. Choosing Edit Font List allows you to add additional
fonts you may have installed on your computer to the Font drop-down
list. Most computers will have standard fonts like Arial and Helvetica
and won’t have less common fonts like, say, Univers or Futura.
✦Style: Dreamweaver has been updated to work better with CSS styles.
Styles defined within the document or in a linked stylesheet will be
available from the Style drop-down list. You can also use the drop-down
list to attach a stylesheet and create and edit styles.
✦Size: Select a font size from the Size drop-down list. The options include
none (choosing this option displays text in the default size), specific
numbers, generic sizes XX-small to XX-large, and relative sizes Smaller
and Larger. If you select a number, the unit-of-measurement drop-down
list becomes available so that you can specify what the font size
number refers to (pixels, ems, and so on).
✦Color: Click the color box and select a text color from the Web safe
color palette that appears. Alternatively, you may enter a hexa-
decima color code directly in any color code text field. (To set the
default text color for a page, check out the “Establishing Page
Properties” section, earlier in this chapter.)
✦Bold or Italic: Click the Bold button to make your selected text appear
in bold. Click the Italic button to italicize your selected text. You can
click either button or both.
✦Alignment: Click an alignment button to align your text. Choices are
Left, Center, Right, and Justify.

✦Link: Type a URL in this field to transform selected text into a hypertext
link. You can also use the Point to File tool to link to a file. To link to a
file using this tool, just follow these steps:
1. Open the Files panel by choosing Window➪Files or by pressing F8.
2. Open the Explorer to the folder location that includes the file you
want to link to by selecting the collapsing menu squares.
Alternatively, skip to Step 3 and hover your cursor over the folder
that contains the file; the folder will expand so you can select the file
within.
3. Click and hold the Point to File button in the Text Property inspec-
tor and drag the pointer to the file you want to link to. Release the
mouse button when the pointer is over the file.
The Point to File button looks like a compass without the needle or a
clock face without hands or numbers. It’s located to the right of the
Links field.
When you’re dragging the button, a line appears from the origin
point to your cursor, as shown in Figure 2-5.
After you let go of the mouse button, the link to the file appears in
the Link text field. If you select the Link drop-down list, it shows you
your recent links as well.

✦Target: If you are linking the selected text, you can specify how the
linked page will open when the user clicks the link by selecting one of
the following options from the drop-down list:
• _blank: Opens the link in a new window.
• _parent: Opens the link in the parent of the currently opened
window. If the window with the link in it is not in a frame, the linked
page opens in the same window as the link. If the link is in a frame,
the linked window will open in the parent frame or in the parent
window of the frame with the link. See Book II, Chapter 4 for more
information about frames.
• _self: Opens the link in the currently opened window; this is the
default target.
• _top: Opens the link in the top-level window, replacing frames, if any.
✦List: Click the Unordered List button next to the Target field to trans-
form text into an unordered (bulleted) list; click the Ordered List button
to transform text into an ordered (numbered) list.
✦Placement: Click the Text Outdent button you find next to the Ordered
List button to outdent (decrease the indent) the selected text; click the
Text Indent button to indent the selected text. If you outdent an item in
a bulleted or numbered list, the item will no longer be a list item.
Inserting a line break
When you want to start a new line in a word-processing program, you press
the Enter key. If you press Enter in Dreamweaver, you create a paragraph
break, which starts a new paragraph, creating a blank space between para-
graphs. If you want to start a new line directly under another line of text
and without the big space between lines, you need to insert a line break. In
Dreamweaver, you create a line break by choosing Insert➪HTML➪Special
Characters➪Line Break or by pressing Shift+Enter. Alternatively, you may
click the Insert Line Break button from the HTML category of the Insert bar.
Dreamweaver places the cursor at the start of the next line and inserts the
line break HTML code.
Working with Images
Aside from entering text, manipulating images on a Web page is probably the
most common Dreamweaver function you perform. You can add or delete an
image and modify its properties to create an aesthetically pleasing layout
that effectively conveys the information you want to deliver to the user.

Working with Images
64
To see how to place an image on the background of your page, check out the
“Establishing Page Properties” section, earlier in this chapter.
Inserting an image
To insert an image on a page, follow these steps:
1. Choose Insert➪Image.
Alternatively, you can click the Insert Image button in the Common cate-
gory of the Insert bar.
2. In the Select Image Source dialog box that appears (shown in Figure
2-6), click the image you want to insert.
If the image is outside the folder that holds your HTML document, use
the Look In drop-down list to browse to the file you want.
3. Click OK to insert the image.
Note: Every image you want to include on a Web page should reside
within the root folder of the current site (typically, you should have
your HTML files in the site root folder — the master folder that holds
everything on your site — and all your images in an images folder that’s
also in the site’s root folder). If you attempt to insert an image from
another location, Dreamweaver asks whether you want to copy the
image to the current site root folder. Click Yes. In the Copy File As dialog
box, you can enter a new name for the image in the File Name text field,
or you can accept the current name and click the Save button.
Figure 2-6:
Select an
image.

Always be sure you have saved your HTML file at least once before you
insert an image into it. If your file isn’t saved, Dreamweaver won’t know
where to place the image in relation to the file. After you’ve saved the file in
a particular folder, the location is known and Dreamweaver can include the
correct relative location of the image.
Put a check in the Preview Images check box at the bottom of the Select
Image Source dialog box to view a thumbnail of the image before you select
it for insertion. The preview area also tells you the size of the image and the
expected download time.
Deleting or moving an image
To delete an image from a page, click the image in the Document window
and press the Delete key on your keyboard.
If you want to move the image from one place on the page to another, you
can click the image in the Document window, press Ctrl+X to cut the image,
click the spot on the page where you want to move the image, and press
Ctrl+V to paste the image. You can also move an image by clicking and drag-
ging it to a new location.
Modifying an image
You can modify how an image appears on a page by editing its size and
alignment, adding a border, and changing other attributes.
To modify an image, click the image in the Document window to select it. If
the Image Property inspector does not appear, choose Window➪Properties
to open it.
To see all the options the Image Property inspector offers, click the down
arrow in the bottom right-hand corner of the Image Property inspector.
(Clicking the up arrow displays fewer options.)
You can do any of the following things to modify the way an image appears:
✦Resize the image: Click and drag a sizing handle to change the dimen-
sions of the image. To resize the image maintaining the same propor-
tions, hold down the Shift key as you drag a sizing handle. You can also
resize the image by typing new pixel dimensions in the W and H text
fields in the Image Property inspector. Click the Resample button to
conform the resized image to the new dimensions (otherwise resizing in
Dreamweaver changes the dimensions in which the browser draws the
image, but leaves the image file itself untouched — and image quality
will suffer when the browser resizes the image). If you want the resized

Working with Images
66
image to look its best, you may be better off resizing the image in
Fireworks, because Fireworks gives you more control over the resizing
process. To edit the image in Fireworks, select the image and click the
Fireworks button in the Edit section of the Properties panel.
✦Align the image: In the Image Property inspector, click an alignment
button to position the image on the page (or within a cell if the image is
located in a table cell). Alignment button choices are Left, Center, and
Right. To align an image with special word wrapping, select one of the
alignment options, which are detailed in Table 2-1, from the Align drop-
down list that appears when you position your image near a bunch of
text.
✦Add a border to the image: In the Image Property inspector, enter a
number in the Border text field to add a border of that thickness to the
image. Border thickness is measured in pixels.
✦Pad an image with spaces: In the Image Property inspector, enter a
number in pixels in the V Space (V for vertical) text field for the space
you want to appear between the top and bottom of the image and other
page elements; then enter a number in pixels in the H Space (H for hori-
zontal) text field for the space you want to appear between the image
and page elements on either side of the image.
✦Make the image a link: In the Image Property inspector, enter a URL in
the Link text field.
✦Specify alternative text for the image: In the Image Property inspector,
enter alternative text in the Alt text field. (Specifying alternative text
ensures that when viewers’ browsers don’t — or can’t — display the
image, some meaningful text appears instead, and also serves as an
alternative for sight-impaired visitors to your page.)
✦Name the image: In the Image Property inspector, enter a name in the
text field next to the thumbnail image. (Naming an image is important if
you want to refer to that image using a behavior or scripting language,
such as JavaScript, but is otherwise unnecessary.)
✦Edit the image: In the Image Property inspector, click the Edit button.
Dreamweaver allows you to optimize, crop, resample an image, adjust
its brightness and contrast, and sharpen it by using the buttons in the
Edit section of the Image Property inspector. If you want the most con-
trol over the process of editing the image, click the Fireworks button to
open the image in Fireworks. You’ll have the choice of working directly
with the image or opening the source file the image came from. In most
cases, you maintain the highest image quality by manipulating the pre-
optimized source version of the image and then exporting it as a new
GIF or JPEG. If you don’t see the Fireworks icon in the Edit section of the

Book II
Chapter 2

Web Pages
Working with Links
67
Properties panel when you select an image, you may have to set it (or
another program) as your primary image editor. See Book II, Chapter 8
for instructions on making Fireworks your primary image editor.
✦Change the image file: In the Image Property inspector, enter a different
filename in the Src text field (or click the File Folder button to browse
for image files).
✦Add an image map: In Dreamweaver, you can add multiple hyperlinked
hotspots to images to create an image map. In the bottom left of the
Image Property inspector, you see an arrow pointer and some image
tools (a rectangle, circle, and free form hotspot creator). With these
tools, you can create hotspots on your images, and you can specify the
following for each hotspot:
• The link location for the hotspot
• The target window for the link
• The alternate text for the hotspot

Working with Links
Linking your page to other Web pages enables you to direct visitors to
related content on the Web. To insert a link, you must specify an image or
some text to serve as the link; you must also specify the link location to
which you want to send your visitors. The link can go to a page within your
site or to a page elsewhere on the Web.

Working with Links
68
Inserting a link
To insert a link on a page, follow these steps:
1. Select the text or image you want to make into a link.
Doing so opens the Property inspector for your text or image. If the
Property inspector does not appear, choose Window➪Properties to
open it.
2. In the Link area of the Property inspector, enter the destination URL
of the link (text or image) that you created in Step 1.
The URL you specify can be any valid URL, for example, a Web page
within your own site (somePage.html), a page on the Web (http://
www.someSite.com/somePage.html), or even an e-mail address
(mailto:somebody@somewhere.com).
Alternatively, you may click the File Folder button you see in the
Property inspector to display the Select File dialog box. After you
browse your computer using the Select File dialog box and select a
file, click OK to make that file the target of a link.
To create an e-mail link quickly, click anywhere in your document and choose
Insert➪Email Link. Specifying the same value for the Text and E-mail fields
that appear allows folks who haven’t configured their Web browsers to handle
e-mail automatically to see the e-mail address on the page. Then, they can
copy and paste the e-mail address information into their e-mail program of
choice.
Deleting a link
To delete a link from text or an image, without deleting the text or image
itself, follow these steps:
1. Select the text or image you want to remove the link from.
The Property inspector for your text or image opens. If the Property
inspector doesn’t appear, choose Window➪Properties to open it.
2. In the Property inspector, delete the URL from the Link text field.
Note that if you delete a linked image or linked text from a page, the link
gets deleted along with the text or image.
Using named anchors
When you want to create a navigational link that connects users not only to
a page, but also to a specific location on the page, you need to create a
named anchor. Named anchors are frequently used for jumping to exact
positions within a large block of text so that users don’t have to scroll
through paragraph after paragraph to find the information they need.

Book II
Chapter 2
Creating Basic
Web Pages
Working with Links
69
Setting up named anchors is especially useful when creating links from a
directory or a table of contents to the content it presents.
Inserting a named anchor
Place an anchor anywhere on your Web page as follows:
1. In the Document window, click at the position you want to insert the
named anchor.
2. Click the Named Anchor button on the Common category of the
Insert bar or choose Insert➪Named Anchor.
The Named Anchor dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 2-7. If the
Insert bar is set to a different category, click and hold the category
name and select Common from the drop-down list.
3. Type a name in the Anchor Name text field.
4. Click OK.
It’s a good idea to insert the named anchor tag slightly above the actual
position where you want the link to target. Doing so gives your targeted con-
tent a little padding on top. Otherwise, the top of your image or your first
line of text appears flush with the top of the browser window.
Linking to a named anchor
To link to a named anchor, follow the procedure outlined in the “Inserting a
link” section, earlier in this chapter, with the following modifications:
✦Linking to a named anchor on the current page: In the Link text field
of the Property inspector, type a pound sign (#) followed by the anchor
name.
✦Linking to a named anchor on a different page: In the Link text field of
the Property inspector, type the page’s URL followed by a pound sign
and then the anchor name.
Be sure not to include any spaces in the names of anchors. These may not
be read by the various Web browsers.

Anchor
dialog box.

Working with Tables
70
Working with Tables
You can position objects (such as text blocks, images, or animations) rela-
tive to each other on a page in two basic ways:
✦Using tables: A time-honored Web tradition for page layout, tables are
grids of cells defined by columns and rows. Cells can have set sizes and
alignments and may contain anything you can put on a Web page,
including other tables.
✦Using layers: Layers can be positioned precisely, and in Dreamweaver,
layers are in some ways easier to use than tables. For instructions on
how to lay out your Web page with layers, see Book II, Chapter 5.
Adding a table to a Web page can help you lay out page elements more easily
in the Document window. Tables consist of as many holding areas, or cells,
as you want, and you can place virtually any Web element, such as text or an
image, into a cell. Cells are organized horizontally into rows and vertically
into columns. Dreamweaver provides you with complete control over the size,
position, color, and other attributes of your table. And you can edit these
attributes at any time via the Table Property inspector.
Inserting a table
To insert a table into a Web page, just follow these steps:
1. Click in the document where you want the table to go.
2. Choose Insert➪Table or use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Alt+T, or
click the Table button in the Common category of the Insert bar.
The Insert Table dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 2-8. If the Insert
bar is set to a different category, click and hold the category name and
select Common from the drop-down list.
3. Enter the number of rows and columns you want the table to have in
the corresponding Rows and Columns fields.
You can always add or remove rows or columns later.
4. Use the Table Width field to set a width for the table.
The width can be either a set number of pixels or a percentage of the
area that bounds the table (the page itself, or, if the table is nested in a
cell, that cell).
5. In the Border Thickness field, enter a number for how many pixels
thick you want the border of your table to be.
If you don’t want the table border to show (which you probably don’t if
you’re using the table for page layout purposes), enter 0 (zero).

Book II
Chapter 2
Creating Basic
Web Pages
Working with Tables
71
6. In the Cell Padding field, enter a whole number for the amount of
pixels you want between the border of the cell and the text or object
inside the cell.
The cell padding applies to the top, bottom, left, and right of the inside
of each and every cell.
7. In the Cell Spacing field, enter a number for the amount of pixels you
want between the cells.
The cell spacing applies to the whole table; you can’t have different cell
spacing for individual rows or columns.
8. If your table has a header row or header column (or both), click the
button (None, Left, Top, or Both) that represents the header structure
of your table.
The text in a header row has special formatting, which you can define in
a stylesheet. If you’re creating a table for layout purposes, you won’t
want a header row or column, so make sure None is selected.
9. In the Accessibility section of the Insert Table dialog box, enter a cap-
tion and summary for the table if you need to describe the table for a
sight-impaired audience.
If you’re making the table for page layout purposes, leave these blank.
10. Click OK.
The Insert Table dialog box disappears, and the empty table appears in
your document.
Figure 2-8:
Fill out the
Insert Table
dialog box
to create a
table.

Working with Tables
72
An empty table is shown in Figure 2-9. To enter data into the table, just click
on an individual cell and enter the content you want in that cell. You can
modify any of the table’s attributes by selecting the table and changing the
attributes in the Properties inspector or the Tag Inspector panel.
Deleting a table
To delete a table from a page, click the border of the table to select it and
then press the Backspace or Delete key. Dreamweaver removes the table
from your page and deletes the associated code in the HTML for the page.
Naturally, everything that was in the table is also deleted from the page.
Using layout tables
The use of tables is central to the traditional way of building great Web pages
(for information on laying out pages with layers, see Book II, Chapter 5). What
happens, though, when you want to put an image right smack in the middle of
a page, or when you want to have one column of information along the right
side of the page, and a square text block at the bottom of the page? You can
nest tables, which involves building new tables inside of cells of other tables.
This is the tried and true method for a lot of developers, but creating nested
tables is complicated and not at all fun, especially with complex pages.
Thankfully, Dreamweaver offers an easy way to work with complex tables
called layout tables. With a layout table, you tell Dreamweaver where you
Figure 2-9:
A simple
table.

Book II
Chapter 2
Creating Basic
Web Pages
Working with Tables
73
want to put something on the screen, and the program generates all the
required table work to make it happen.
To create a layout table, just follow these steps:
1. Click the Layout view button in the Layout category on the Insert bar.
If the Insert bar is set to a different category, click and hold the category
name and select Layout from the drop-down list.
2. Click the Layout Table button (just to the right of the Layout view
button).
3. Click and drag the cross hair to create the layout table of your choice.
A light green table appears, as shown in Figure 2-10, with the dimen-
sions you gave it.
4. To create individual cells within that table, click the Draw Layout Cell
button to the right of the Layout Table button and draw a cell any-
where within the table.
If you create a layout cell outside a layout table, Dreamweaver will
create both the cell and the table to support it. Note that you cannot
draw a new cell that overlaps an existing cell in the table.

Previewing Your Work
74
If you create a layout cell, you can immediately edit the cell you created.
However, if you create a layout table, you either have to switch back to
Standard view to edit the single cell of that table or create a layout cell
within the table before you can edit the table.
Storing information in table cells
After you insert a table on a page, you can add or delete elements, such as
text and images, in the table cells:
✦Adding an image to a cell: To add an image to a table cell, click in a table
cell and choose Insert➪Image. Browse and select an image you want to
add to the cell, and then click OK. (For more information on inserting
images, flip to the “Inserting an image” section, earlier in this chapter.)
✦Adding text to a cell: To add text to a table cell, click to position the
cursor in a table cell and type the text you want placed inside the cell.
✦Deleting an image from a cell: To delete an image from a table cell,
select the image and press Backspace or Delete.
✦Deleting text from a cell: To delete text from a table cell, select the text
and press Backspace or Delete.
Previewing Your Work
Whether you’re working in Code view or Design view, at some point you’ll
want to see the page as visitors to your site will see it: in a browser such as
Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator. If you have two or more browsers
on your computer, you can preview your page in any of the browsers —
without leaving Dreamweaver — by using the Preview in Browser feature.
To preview your page in your primary browser, choose File➪Preview in
Browser➪Browser Name or use the keyboard shortcut F12. The keyboard
shortcut for previewing in your secondary browser is Shift+F12.

reamweaver MX 2004 can be used to create many different kinds of
Web pages. During the course of building a Web site, you’ll add pages,
graphics, links, and all sorts of related information into a single location to
be posted eventually to a Web server on the Internet. After your site is com-
plete, you’ll probably want to make updates and fixes. Heck, you may even
be making more than one site at the same time!
To help facilitate management of your Web site (or sites), Dreamweaver
offers a suite of site management tools. These tools are collectively called a
Dreamweaver Site. This chapter explores how you can use these tools to
manage your Web site more easily.
Defining a Site in Dreamweaver MX 2004
Figure 3-1 shows a typical relationship between where you build your Web
site (your desktop) and where the site actually lives on the Internet (a Web
server). Dreamweaver Sites facilitate getting all the correct information
from your desktop to the Web server and generally make the Web page 
creation process easier. Specifically, a Dreamweaver Site enables you to do
the following:
✦Move files seamlessly back and forth between your local machine and
your Web server
✦Keep all your site files in a single location

Creating Your First Site
76
✦Generate pages for your site based on templates that you create
✦Run reports on the pages in your site to check links, page load, and
other key functions
✦Use source- and version-control to manage who works on what files and
when they do it, which can prevent team members from accidentally
overwriting each other’s work when building or maintaining a site 
collaboratively
Creating Your First Site
Earlier versions of Dreamweaver required every Web page you created or
edited to be part of a Dreamweaver Site. With Dreamweaver MX 2004,
Macromedia has removed that often-cumbersome requirement. Nevertheless,
if you’re working with a set of files regularly in Dreamweaver, or if you’re man-
aging several sites, you’re likely to find using Dreamweaver Sites an efficient
way of working.
You can create a site in Dreamweaver manually or by using a wizard, as the
following sections describe.
Creating a site manually
This section shows you how to create a Dreamweaver Site manually. The fol-
lowing steps walk you through inputting the minimum amount of information
that you need to enter to create your site. However, you can choose from a
number of other options, and they are covered in the “Using Advanced Site
Options” section, later in this chapter.

To create a basic site manually, follow these steps:
1. Choose Site➪Manage Sites.
The Manage Sites dialog box appears. You can also open the Manage
Sites dialog box by choosing Manage Sites from the drop-down list in
the Files panel that shows the current site.
2. Click the New button.
A pop-up menu appears with the choices Site and FTP & RDS Server.
3. Select Site.
The Site Definition dialog box appears, open to the Advanced tab by
default. The Local Info options, shown in Figure 3-2, appear by default.
4. Set the options for your site by filling out each of the following pieces
of information:
• Site Name: Choose a name that you can remember easily and that
applies to the function of the site.
• Local Root Folder: This is the location on your hard drive where you
want to store the files that make up your site. Again, you should title

the folder something intuitive and easy to remember. If you want to
browse for a folder, just click the folder icon to the right of the text
field.
• Refresh Local File List Automatically: When this option is selected,
Dreamweaver refreshes the list of files in your site every time you
copy a file into the site. The option is selected by default. 
• Default Images Folder: This is the standard directory for images
used on your site. Dreamweaver adds images here when you copy
image files into your site. A good practice is to name this folder
images (if your site is going to be hosted on a UNIX-based server, you
need to be consistent about using upper- and lowercase letters in file-
names and links to those files from your site). If you want to browse
for the directory, just click the folder icon next to the text field.
• HTTP Address: This is the URL of your Web site. Dreamweaver uses
this to verify that links in your site are working properly.
• Enable Cache: Selecting this option speeds up Dreamweaver’s site
management tools and is required for the Assets panel to work. See
your documentation for information about using the Assets panel.
5. Click OK to create the site.
Dreamweaver creates a folder for your site if it doesn’t exist on your hard
drive, but it doesn’t create the images directory within that folder. Thus, it’s
always a good idea to create your folders on the hard drive first, and then
create your site.
Creating a site using a wizard
You may think that using a wizard to create a site is easier, which is true if
you’re creating a complex site. However, if you’re creating a simple site (one
that you’ll be working on by yourself and that doesn’t employ a server tech-
nology or testing server, for example) the manual route is the way to go.
To use the wizard, follow these steps:
1. Choose Site➪Manage Sites.
The Manage Sites dialog box appears.
2. Click the New button.
A pop-up menu appears with the choices Site and FTP & RDS Server.
3. Select Site.
The Site Definition dialog box appears, open to the Advanced tab by
default. (It just so happens that the Advanced tab has all the stuff
for defining your site manually, whereas the Basic tab holds the Site
Definition wizard.)

4. Click the Basic tab to access the wizard, as shown in Figure 3-3.
5. Enter a name for your site in the appropriate text field, and then click
Next.
The Editing Files, Part 2 page of the wizard appears.
6. If your site is going to be dynamic, choose a server technology to
process Web pages before they’re sent to the user, and then click Next.
Select a technology by selecting the Yes radio button and selecting your
Web serving technology from the drop-down list. Dreamweaver provides
you with several server options, including several flavors of ASP, plus
JSP, PHP, and (of course) ColdFusion. If you’re not using a server 
technology, select the No radio button.
7. In the new page that appears, choose how you want to edit your files,
and then click Next.
If you have selected to use a server technology on the Editing Files, Part 2
page, then on the Editing Files, Part 3 page you get the Dynamic options
shown in Table 3-1; if you’re not using a server technology, you get the
Static options. Click the radio button next to the option you want to
choose.

8. In the new page that appears, configure your testing environment,
and then click Next.
Based on the editing and testing methodology you chose in Step 7, you
are asked to configure your testing environment. Here are the various
options:
• Edit and Test Locally: For this method, you are asked to provide the
local URL for testing. Usually, this is http://localhost/folder,
where folder is the name of the root folder of your site.
In order to ensure that this method works properly, always make
sure that you create your site within the directory for http://
localhost on your hard drive. For most Windows 2000 or XP
computers, this location is C:\inetpub\wwwroot\ by default.
• Edit Locally, Then Upload to Remote Testing Server: If you select
this route, click Next to see a page where you can select a method of
connecting to the remote location for your site. Your options are
Local/Network, FTP, RDS (Remote Development Services, used in
conjunction with ColdFusion), and the always popular, “I’ll set this
up later.” Figure 3-4 shows the Local/Network option.
• Edit Directly on (Remote Testing) Server Using Local Network: If
you’ve chosen this option, then you are asked for the URL of the
remote server, as shown in Figure 3-5, so that Dreamweaver knows
where to look to test your site. If you want to edit directly on the
remote testing server using FTP or RDS, click the Create an FTP or
RDS server connection text link on the first page of the wizard.

Dreamweaver includes options for source control, which you can use to
prevent team members from overwriting each others’ work when col-
laborating. You can choose to enable it here by selecting the Yes radio
button. File sharing is discussed in more detail in the section, “Using
Source Control,” later in this chapter.
10. Review your settings and click Done to set up your site.
The Site Definition dialog box closes. Click Done to close the Manage
Sites dialog box.
Setting Up a Remote Connection
After you create your site, either by using the wizard or by setting it up man-
ually, it’s a good idea to get connected to the place where the remote ver-
sion of your site (the one users will access via the World Wide Web) will live.
Dreamweaver can connect to a remote server in a variety of ways. The route
you choose depends largely on how you plan to build and maintain your
site. You have essentially three different scenarios:
✦Creating and testing your site solely on your own computer: For exam-
ple, this may be the case if you’re building your site for someone else, say
a client. Here the remote server is your computer — not all that remote!
✦Creating your site on your computer, but testing it somewhere else:
This is the most common situation. Dreamweaver has three different
delivery options for this scenario: FTP, Remote Development Services
(RDS), and local network connection.
✦Creating and testing your site on a remote machine: In this case, the
options are the same as in the previous bullet. The only difference is
that when you’re editing, you’re editing files directly on the remote loca-
tion, leaving nothing on your local machine.
In many cases, your remote location is at an externally hosted Internet
Service Provider (ISP). If you’ve got an account set up with an ISP, make sure
to get the following information, which is required for Dreamweaver to set
up a connection to your remote Web server:
✦An IP address or a URL to be used when posting your files
✦A folder on the remote server where you are supposed to keep your site
files
✦A username for your account
✦A password for your account

Book II
Chapter 3
Creating and Using
Dreamweaver Sites
Setting Up a Remote Connection
83
To set up a remote connection, follow these steps:
1. Choose Site➪Manage Sites to bring up the Manage Sites dialog box,
shown in Figure 3-6.
2. Select your site from the list on the left, and then click the Edit
button.
The Site Definition dialog box appears, open to the Advanced tab.
3. From the Category list on the left, select Remote Info.
Along the right side of the dialog box, the Local Info options are
replaced with the Remote Info options. If you haven’t set up a connec-
tion previously, all you see is the Access drop-down list.
4. Select an option from the Access drop-down list.
You can choose from several Access options in this list, including:
• FTP: The industry standard File Transfer Protocol.
• Local/Network: A location on your local (meaning office, home
office, and so on) network.
• RDS: ColdFusion’s Remote Development Services allows secure
remote access to files within a ColdFusion application server.
• SourceSafe Database: SourceSafe is Microsoft’s version control
application, which helps prevent the accidental overwriting of
files when you’re collaborating with others to build the site. With
Dreamweaver, you can integrate SourceSafe and use it for your 
version control.
• WebDAV: This stands for Web-based Distributed Authoring and
Versioning. Like SourceSafe, it’s a standard for version control
and is used with Web servers like Apache Web Server and
Microsoft’s IIS.
Figure 3-6:
The
Manage
Sites
dialog box.

Setting Up a Remote Connection
84
5. Fill out the appropriate information for the connection type you
selected.
Leave the source control settings alone for the moment, which are
described in the “Using Source Control” section, later in this chapter.
The following list describes the information needed for each connection
type:
• FTP: In addition to the four items we note at the beginning of this
section (host, folder, username, and password), you also need to
select the Passive FTP check box if you plan to use Passive FTP
(required for some servers). If there’s a firewall you need to work
through, you can click the Firewall Settings button to set the Firewall
preferences in the dialog box that appears, as shown in Figure 3-7.
Select the Use Secure FTP (SFTP) check box if you want to use
encrypted secure logins (again, not likely). After you’ve added the
necessary settings, you’re able to connect to your ISP.
If you select Automatically Upload Files to Server on Save,
Dreamweaver will automatically make a connection to the remote
server and upload your file each time you save it.
Select the Enable File Check In and Check Out option if you’re work-
ing in a collaborative environment and you want to ensure that other
team members can’t work on a file at the same time you’re working
on it. If you select this option, you need to add information that will
identify you to your collaborators.
• Local/Network: Here, you only need to specify the location of the
remote folder on the network or a local drive, which you can enter
Figure 3-7:
Setting your
Firewall
preferences.

manually or by clicking the folder icon to browse the network for the
folder location. You can also select the Refresh check box if you’d
like the list of files on your site to be automatically refreshed when a
new file is added.
• RDS: If you select RDS from the drop-down list, you need to click the
Settings button next to the list to configure the RDS connection, as
shown in Figure 3-8. To configure RDS, you need a host name (IP
address or URL), port number (the default is 80), the directory of
the site on the host, a username, and a password. If you don’t want
the password saved, then deselect the Save check box.
• SourceSafe: As with RDS, with SourceSafe you have to click the
Settings button next to the drop-down list. Then you specify the
location of the SourceSafe Database Path (a path to an .ini file, 
usually on a network volume), the name of the project, a username,
and a password. If you don’t want the password saved, then deselect
the Save check box.
• WebDAV: With WebDAV, you must also click the Settings button next
to the drop-down list to configure the connection. You need the URL
of the connection, a username, a password, and an e-mail address. If
you don’t want the password saved, then deselect the Save check box.
6. Click OK to put the changes into effect.
Using Advanced Site Options
If you used the wizard to create your site, you may have been struck by the
array of questions asked. That’s because you can configure a number of
advanced settings with Dreamweaver. Most of them you’re not likely to
need, but just in case, we describe them in the following sections. You can
access all these options by selecting the name of the item in the Category
list of the Site Definition dialog box (refer to Figure 3-2).
Figure 3-8:
The
Configure

dialog box.

Using Advanced Site Options
86
Testing your server
Select Testing Server from the Category list on the Advanced tab of the Site
Definition dialog box to access the options for setting up your testing server.
If you’re building a dynamic site, you need to have a Web server running
that can process the pages and render them as HTML. (For more on how
this is accomplished, see Book VI, Chapter 3.) To specify a Web serving
technology, do the following:
1. Select a Web server from the Server Model drop-down list, as shown
in Figure 3-9.
You have several options here, but if you’re working within the
Macromedia model, your selection is probably going to be ColdFusion.
2. Select an Access type.
You can choose FTP or Local/Network. If you chose RDS on the Remote
Info screen, you see an RDS option here as well. Choosing any of them
provides additional fields for you to fill out, as specified for each Access
type in the “Setting Up a Remote Connection” section, earlier in this
chapter. Choose None if you don’t want to use a testing server.
3. Click OK to save your settings.

Cloaking
Cloaking is a handy and appropriately named feature in Dreamweaver Sites.
When enabled, cloaking allows you to hide different file types or folders
from Dreamweaver’s site tools. This can be especially helpful if you keep
your raw asset files (your source Fireworks PNGs, Flash FLAs, and so on)
in the same directory as the site itself, but you don’t want the files uploaded
or downloaded, included in reports, or otherwise touched by various
Dreamweaver operations. To engage this feature, click the Advanced tab of
the Site Definition dialog box and select Cloaking from the Category list on
the left. Then select the Enable Cloaking check box, as well as the Cloak
Files Ending With check box, and add the file extensions for the file types
you want to mask. See the online Help files for more details.
Using Design Notes
Design Notes aren’t really necessary unless you’re working on your site 
collaboratively in Dreamweaver with other people. Then, Design Notes can
be especially helpful. For example, you can use Design Notes to let others
know the status of a given file. To engage Design Notes, click the Advanced
tab of the Site Definition dialog box, select Design Notes from the Category
list on the left, and then simply select the Maintain Design Notes check box.
If you want to move the notes to the server when the site is published, so
that other team members can access them, select the Upload Design Notes
for Sharing check box.
Setting up a site map
If you select Site Map Layout in the Category list in the Site Definition dialog
box, you can set up the specifics of how you’d like your site’s Site Map to
look. You can specify the following:
✦The home page for the site map, which can be different from the home
page (index.htm) of the site
✦The number and width of the columns of the map
✦The labels for the site map icons
✦Whether or not to display items marked hidden
✦Whether or not to display dependent files
Selecting columns for the File view
For the File view, shown in Figure 3-10, you have six built-in columns to
choose from: Name, Notes, Size, Type, Modified, and Checked Out By.

Using Advanced Site Options
88
However, you can also add and remove your own columns by clicking the
(+) and (–) buttons, respectively. For a column you create, you can also
specify the following:
✦The column name
✦The column’s Design Note association, if its contents relate to a specific
Design Note
✦The text alignment for the column
✦The option to show or not show the column in the File view (Note: The
Name column cannot be hidden or moved.)
✦Whether or not to share the column so other workers on the site can
see it (Note: You must have Maintain Design Notes checked to share a
column.)
Enabling Contribute compatibility
To enable compatibility with Contribute 2, click the Advanced tab of the Site
Definition dialog box and select Contribute from the Category list on the left.
Select the Enable Contribute Compatibility check box if you plan to have
people maintain your site using Contribute. Selecting this option allows you to
perform many administrative functions related to Contribute. (For example,
you can send Connection Keys based on your Dreamweaver Site setups.)

Publishing Your Site
After you’ve set up a remote site in a Dreamweaver Site, publishing your site
is a snap. To publish your site to a remote server, just follow these steps:
1. If the Files panel isn’t already open, open it by choosing Window➪
Files or by pressing F8.
2. On the File tab, click the Expand/Collapse button (the button on the
far right of the toolbar) to switch to File view mode.
This brings up the File view shown in Figure 3-11.
3. If you haven’t connected to the remote server since you launched
Dreamweaver most recently, click the Connection button at the left of
the Files panel toolbar to establish a connection with the remote
server.
4. Select a file and click the Put button on the toolbar (upward pointing
blue arrow) to copy a file from the local server to the remote server
or the Get button (downward pointing green arrow) to copy a file
from the remote server to the local server.
If you’re copying files for the first time, simply select the site’s root
folder and click the Put button. To copy files from the Local to Remote
servers, or vice versa, you can also simply click and drag the elements
from local to remote, or vice versa. If you use this method, be careful
to place files in the correct folders.
Figure 3-11:
Remote and
local sites.

Maintaining Your Site
90
If you ever want to see what’s going on behind the scenes when you’re copy-
ing those files, just click the FTP button in the toolbar in File view. The
Results panel appears/expands and shows you the remote connections
being set and all the commands for the files being sent (the File view col-
lapses back to the Files panel as well).
Maintaining Your Site
After your site is built, you want to make sure that it’s running at peak effi-
ciency. To help in this effort, Dreamweaver offers some valuable tools that
can help you keep on top of the wide array of items that go into keeping
your site running smoothly. We describe the two basic types of tools,
reports and link checkers, in detail in the following sections.
Running reports
Reports encapsulate information about various aspects of your site at the
time the reports are run, giving you a snapshot of things, such as which files
on your site are currently being worked on by different team members,
whether all the images on a selected page have Alt tags, and more. To run a
report in Dreamweaver, just follow these steps:
1. Choose Site➪Reports.
The Reports dialog box, shown in Figure 3-12, appears.
2. Choose what you want to run the report against.
You can choose to run a report on the currently selected document, the
entire site, selected files in the site, or a folder within the site. Select one
of these options from the Report On drop-down list.
Figure 3-12:
The Reports
dialog box.

Book II
Chapter 3
Creating and Using
Dreamweaver Sites
Maintaining Your Site
91
3. Select the reports you want to run by selecting the check box next to
their names.
You can run nine possible reports, across two categories:
• Checked Out By: This report tells you what files in source control
are currently being used by different members of the team. If you
want the report to show only which files are currently checked out
by a particular team member, click the Report Settings button at the
bottom of the dialog box while the report is selected and add an
individual’s name to the text field in the Checked Out By dialog box
that pops up.
• Design Notes: This report prints out all the Design Notes associated
with files on the site. To filter your results via the Design Notes
dialog box, shown in Figure 3-13, click the Report Settings button
while the Design Notes report is selected.
• Recently Modified: This report shows which files have been modi-
fied within parameters you set by clicking the Report Settings button
and specifying in the Recently Modified dialog box.
• Combinable Nested Font Tags: This report details locations in the
code where overlapping Font tags could be merged. For example, if
you change the size of a block of text, your code might contain
something like this:
<FONT face=”Arial”><FONT size=”2”>Some
text.</FONT></FONT>
When it could and should be
<FONT face=”Arial” size=”2”>Some text.</FONT>
Figure 3-13:
Filtering
results.

Using Source Control
92
• Accessibility: If you run this report, the site files are scanned to find
places where the code is not ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act)
compliant. For more information about accessibility, browse to the
W3C Web Accessibility Initiative pages at www.w3.org/WAI/
Resources/.
• Missing Alt Text: This report looks for images to make sure they
have Alt text (see the section on modifying an image in Book II,
Chapter 2 for a little info on Alt text).
• Redundant Nested Tags: This report searches the code for locations
where extra tags can be eliminated.
• Removable Empty Tags: If you’re working in Design mode and moving
lots of things around, sometimes the underlying code can be left with
lingering, empty tags. This tool finds those empty tags.
• Untitled Documents: This report searches for pages that may have a
filename but don’t have a title.
4. Click OK to run the reports.
The results appear in the Site Reports tab of the Results panel, as
shown in Figure 3-14.
Checking links
In addition to the reports that help clean up your code, Dreamweaver can
also check the links on your site. To run the Link Check report, choose
Site➪Check Links Sitewide or press Shift+F8. You see the results in the Link
Checker tab in the Results panel. The report shows broken links, external
links, and orphaned files.
Using Source Control
Source control allows team members to check out a document in your site,
thereby locking it and making it uneditable by others until the team member
who checked it out checks it back in again. This process is intended to
ensure that files don’t get overwritten accidentally and that data doesn’t get
lost during the development process.
Figure 3-14:
The Results
panel.

Book II
Chapter 3
Creating and Using
Dreamweaver Sites
Using Source Control
93
In most large-scale software development projects, where you’ve got multi-
tudes of people working on a single code-base, source control is critical. If
your site requires that more than three people work on the same pages and
code, you should consider taking advantage of this feature in Dreamweaver.
To set up source control, do the following:
1. Choose Site➪Manage Sites, select your site, and then click the Edit
button to open the Site Definition dialog box.
2. Click the Advanced tab if it’s not already open and select Remote Info
from the Category list on the left.
3. Set your source control options at the bottom of the screen.
When you enable file check in and check out, the following options
become available:
• Check out files automatically when you open a document within the
site
• Provide your name and e-mail address for site reporting and infor-
mational purposes
You must have selected an Access option on the Remote Info screen
before you can get the Check In/Check Out options to show up at the
bottom of the page. See the “Setting Up a Remote Connection” section,
earlier in this chapter, for more information about Access options.
4. Click OK to save your settings.
To work with a file after you’ve enabled source control, right-click the file
from the Files panel and select one of the following options:
✦Get: Retrieves the most recent version of the file and copies it locally.
✦Check Out: Makes your local version the only editable version of a docu-
ment and ensures that others can’t open and save the file.
✦Put: Copies the local version of your file to the remote location.
✦Check In: Puts your local version of the file on the server and unlocks it
so that others can check it out and work on it if need be.

Chapter 4: Punching Up Your
Pages with Forms and Frames
In This Chapter
 Incorporating forms into your Web page
 Structuring your pages with frames
T
wo of the more popular Web page features, forms and frames, are also
two of the most advanced features. You use them in your Web pages to
serve the following functions:
✦Forms: Enable you to gather information and feedback from the users
who visit your Web pages. Forms can consist of text fields, buttons,
check boxes, radio buttons, and drop-down lists, which enable the user
to enter information or to choose among options you present.
✦Frames: Enable you to construct sophisticated navigational schemes for
your Web site. Frames are actually separate Web pages that are parti-
tioned off so that two or more can be displayed in the same browser
window at the same time. For example, one frame may be a navigational
page consisting of a list of links to other pages; that frame remains in
place in its portion of the browser window even when the user clicks a
link to display a different Web page in the other frame.
In this chapter, you see how to work with these powerful features in
Dreamweaver MX 2004.
Incorporating Forms into Web Pages
Forms on the Web serve the same purpose as the paper-based forms you
fill out — they provide a structured format for gathering specific informa-
tion. The difference is that Web-based forms usually require less time for
keyboard-savvy users to fill out (and using Web-based forms also saves a
few trees otherwise destined for a paper mill).
Dreamweaver offers you a number of handy tools for creating Web-based
forms that you can easily include on your Web pages. You can incorporate
everything from text fields to radio buttons, and you can create surveys,
gather user data, and conduct e-commerce.

Incorporating Forms into Web Pages
96
Creating Web-based forms requires two steps:
1. Creating the form that users see and interact with, which we demon-
strate how to do using Dreamweaver in this chapter.
2. Creating the processing program that accepts and processes form
input, which we cover in more detail in Book VI, Chapter 4.
Adding a form
Before you can insert specific form objects, such as check boxes, on your
Web page, you must first add a form to the page so that the appropriate
code is added to the HTML.
To add a form to a page, click in the Document window where you want to
add the form and choose Insert➪Form➪Form or click the Form button from
the Forms category on the Insert bar. (If the Insert bar is set to a different
category, click and hold the category name and select Common from the
drop-down list.)
Dreamweaver adds the form to the page as indicated by the red dashed
lines and also adds the associated form tag to your HTML page code, as
shown in Figure 4-1. You can now insert form objects inside the red dashed
lines of the form.
Figure 4-1:
The dashed
lines mean
you’ve
created a
form!

Book II
Chapter 4
Punching Up
Your Pages with
Forms and Frames
Incorporating Forms into Web Pages
97
If you attempt to add a form object without first adding a form, a dialog box
appears, asking whether you want to add a form tag. Click Yes to add both
the form tag and the object to your page.
Specifying form properties
A form has six properties that you can set using the Form Property inspec-
tor: Form Name, Action, Method, Enctype, Target, and Class. Click the form
to open the Form Property inspector. (If the Property inspector does not
appear, open it by choosing Window➪Properties.) Then specify the follow-
ing properties:
✦Form Name: Enter an alphanumeric name in the empty text field (the
name should start with a letter, but it can be made up of both letters
and numbers). The advantage of naming your form is that you can use
the name to reference the form in a scripting language that you use to
retrieve, store, and manipulate the form data.
✦Action: Enter the URL of the application document/file that processes
the form data. Alternatively, you can browse to the location by clicking
the folder and making a selection in the Select File dialog box.
You can select the following three common actions:
• Enter the URL of a ColdFusion page that evaluates the form after it’s
been submitted.
• Enter the JavaScript program that runs after the user submits the
form. The action appears as follows:
javascript:function()
Here, function refers to the name of your form-handling function.
• Enter a mailto: address where the form data goes after the user
clicks the Submit button. A mailto: address appears similar to the
following:
mailto:gruntworker@formhandling.com
✦Method: Select a method from the drop-down list for how the form data
passes to the processing entity that you specified in the Action field.
Choices are Default, GET, and POST. (Default and GET are the same.)
GET sends the form data by appending it to the URL that the Action
specifies. POST sends the form data as a separate entity. GET limits the
amount of data that can pass along, but POST does not.
In other words, if you were to choose GET, the URL sent to the server
might look something like http://www.server.com/coldfusionpage.
cfm&bowlingballcolor=blue, with the form data stuck onto the end.
If you were to choose POST instead, the URL would just look something
like http://www.server.com/coldfusionpage.cfm.

Incorporating Forms into Web Pages
98
Most of the time, whether you choose GET or POST doesn’t really make
a difference. However, there are times when you may want to choose
one over the other. For example, for security purposes, you may not
want information, such as a credit card number, ever being shown in a
browser’s history. And if the user might choose to bookmark the URL,
whether or not to have all of the form data appear could affect your
decision. If the form data included secure user information (such as the
credit card example), then you probably wouldn’t want to have the form
data appear. However, if the form data includes search criteria, the user
might want to bookmark the URL complete with the search parameters.
Data received at the specified mailto: address is not formatted for
easy reading: It appears as strings of code with the form data embedded
within it. This may depend on the encoding option, which we are about
to discuss.
✦Enctype: This is an optional attribute. For enctype, your choices are
application/x-www-form-urlencoded (the default), and multipart/
form-data. application/x-www-form-urlencoded replaces all blank
characters in the text with a plus sign (+), and other non-printing char-
acters with symbols and numbers. This is often necessary for the server
to interpret the information it is receiving — for example, when you’ve
used the GET method, the browser would not be able to process a URL
with blank spaces in it. Multipart/form-data does not do this conver-
sion, but instead transfers the information as a compound MIME docu-
ment. Multipart/form-data is the method that must be used if you are
using an <INPUT TYPE=”file”> element in the form. Instead of either
of these two options, you can type in text/plain, which will also send the
data unencoded; however, this is not a W3C standard.
✦Target: This is also an optional attribute. If you do not specify a target,
the server will assume that you want any information that is sent back
to the browser (the URL of the response page, for example) sent to the
same window or frame that your original form is in. If you wish the form
submission’s results to appear in a different frame or window, you must
specify the name of the target window in this attribute.
✦Class: You can apply a CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) class to the form as
a whole and to some form elements in order to control how those form
elements appear in a browser. For example, you can specify the color of
a text field by assigning it a style. This attribute is also optional. For
details on using CSS style sheets, take a look at Cascading Style Sheets
For Dummies, by Damon Dean (published by Wiley Publishing, Inc.).
Labeling form objects
Dreamweaver enables you to provide descriptors for form objects and 
provide the user with directions about how to complete the information

requested for each option. To add descriptors to form objects, simply posi-
tion your cursor in the form and begin typing. Then insert the form object
you want.
Using text fields
Text fields are blank text boxes that you can insert in your form to hold
alphanumeric information that the user types. You can set up a text field to
hold a single line of text, multiple lines of text, or a password, as follows:
✦Single line: Provides space for the user to enter a single word or short
phrase of text.
✦Multi line: Provides space for the user to enter a longer string of text.
Appropriate for a comment box.
✦Password: Provides space for the user to enter a password. An asterisk
or other placeholder appears in the text field for each character that the
user types.
To add a text field, follow these steps:
1. In the Document window, click where you want to add the text field
and choose Insert➪Form➪Text Field, or click the Insert Text Field
button on the Form category of the Insert bar.
If the Insert bar is set to a different category, click and hold the category
name and select Form from the drop-down list.
Dreamweaver adds a text field to your form, and a Text Field Property
inspector appears. If the Text Field Property inspector does not appear,
choose Window➪Properties to open the inspector.
2. Fill in the following fields of the Text Field Property inspector to
define the parameters of the text field:
• TextField name: Enter a name in the empty field. The field is refer-
enced by this name in the HTML page code.
• Char Width: Enter a whole number for the approximate visible
width of the field. (The width is approximate because text charac-
ters in your form are displayed differently according to users’
browser settings.)
• Max Chars: (Applies to Single line and Password fields only.) Enter
a whole number to indicate the maximum number of characters that
the user can enter in the field. Max Chars can be different from Char
Width.
• Num Lines: (Applies to Multi line fields only.) This specifies the
height, in lines, of the form element, and may be affected by the set-
ting for Wrap (see below).

Incorporating Forms into Web Pages
100
• Type: Select a radio button for Single line, Multi line, or Password.
• Init Val: (Optional) Enter an alphanumeric word or phrase that occu-
pies the text field when the user first encounters the field. Users
can enter their own information over the Init Val. If you leave this
attribute blank, the user will see a standard empty text field.
• Wrap: (Applies to Multi line fields only.) Select an option for text
wrapping from the drop-down list. Options consist of Default, Off,
Virtual, or Physical. Default and Off are the same and do not wrap
text until the user presses the Enter key. The Virtual option wraps
text on the user’s screen but not when the form is submitted. The
Physical option wraps text both on the user’s screen and when the
form is submitted.
• Class: (Optional) You may assign a CSS class to a text field to affect
the appearance of the field or the text within it. For details on using
CSS style sheets, look up Cascading Style Sheets For Dummies, by
Damon Dean (published by Wiley Publishing, Inc.).
Setting up buttons
After a user enters data into a form, the user must then perform some sort
of task to transmit the data from his or her computer to another computer
that can process the information. Dreamweaver offers you three buttons
you can use to activate your form: Submit Form, Reset Form, and None:
✦Submit Form: After the user clicks this button, the form data scoots off
to another computer based on the specified action. (You see how to set
the action of a form in the “Specifying form properties” section, earlier
in this chapter.)
✦Reset Form: After the user clicks this button, it erases all data entered
into the form, resetting each form field to its initial value.
✦None: After the user clicks this button, it executes the programming
function that the Web designer assigned to it (for example, performs a
mathematical calculation or sends the user to a different URL).
Follow these steps to insert a button into your form:
1. Click where you want to add the button in the Document window and
choose Insert➪Form➪Button, or click Insert Button on the Form cate-
gory of the Insert bar.
If the Insert bar is set to a different category, click and hold the category
name and select Form from the drop-down list.
Dreamweaver adds a button to your form and the Button Property
inspector becomes visible. If the Button Property inspector does not
appear, choose Window➪Properties to open the inspector.

2. Fill in the following fields of the Button Property inspector to define
the parameters of the button:
• Button name: Enter a name in the empty text field. This name identi-
fies the button in the HTML code.
• Label: Enter the text that you want to appear on the button.
• Action: Select a radio button to indicate the function of the button.
Choices consist of Submit form, Reset form, and None.
• Class: (Optional) You can assign a CSS style to affect the button’s
appearance (color, width, and the like).
You can create a graphical Submit button — a button created from a small
image — by choosing Insert➪Form➪Image Field or by clicking the Image
Field button in the Form category of the Insert bar. Then browse to the
image file in your site or type the path to and name of the image file directly
into the File Name field.
Adding other form elements
In addition to the text fields and buttons, you can add a variety of form ele-
ments that help your users give you information. Figure 4-2 shows some of
the useful form elements you can add to your forms. To insert any of the ele-
ments you see in Figure 4-2, follow these steps:
1. Position your cursor in the area of the Document window where you
want to add the element.
2. Click the appropriate button in the Form category of the Insert bar (see
Figure 4-2), or choose Insert➪Form Objects➪Desired Form Element.
If the Insert bar is set to a different category, click and hold the category
name and select Form from the drop-down list.

Dreamweaver adds the element to your form, and the appropriate
inspector appears. (If the appropriate inspector does not appear, open
it by choosing Windows➪Properties.)
3. Fill in the fields of the inspector.
If you’re adding a radio group, jump menu, or image, a dialog box will
pop up and ask you for additional information. Fill in your choices for
each of these.
4. Click OK to apply your selections and close the dialog box.
Structuring Pages with Frames
Frames are divisions of a Web page that enable you to load information inde-
pendently into distinct regions of the browser window. Frames are useful if
you want to display certain information on-screen while changing other
information. You frequently see three-frame pages on the Web — the top
frame shows the site’s title graphic, the left frame shows the navigation bar,
and the large body frame changes to show the content that you select.
A special HTML page called a frameset defines the structure and formatting
of frames on your Web page. As you work with frames, be aware that you
must always save the frameset page to lay out the size, position, and bor-
ders of your frames, along with the content that you want to display in each
frame. And keep in mind that different browsers may draw the frames
slightly differently, even if you specify exact pixel dimensions.
Adding frames
You can add a frame to a frameless Document window or to an existing
frame within the Document window. Adding a frame to an existing frame
divides the existing frame into two or more regions.
To add a frame, click the Document window or existing frame in the area
where you want to add the frame. Then click the Frames button in the Form
category of the Insert bar and choose from the list of options that pops up.
You can also get to an equivalent list (the same options, some with slightly
different names, and no icons) by choosing Insert➪HTML➪Frames➪Frame
Option, where Frame Option is one of the choices detailed in Table 4-1.

A third method of adding a frame is to drag the outer border of the current
frame, or Alt+click in the inner border. You can then follow the steps in the
next section to modify this new frame.
Modifying frames
You use the Frame Property inspector to select the source page that appears
in a frame. You also use the Frame Property inspector to format the appear-
ance of an individual frame. To modify a frame, follow these steps:
1. If the Properties panel is not already open, open it by choosing
Window➪Properties or by using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+F3.
2. In the Frames panel, Alt+click the frame that you want to modify the
attributes of.
Note: You can’t simply click a frame to open its associated Frame
Property inspector. If you click a frame, you’re actually clicking the
source page that resides in the frame — a process identical to clicking
in the Document window for that page. To select a specific frame, press
the Alt key and click in the frame. You see the Frame Property inspector
for an individual frame, and the selected frame is marked with a dashed
line, as shown in Figure 4-3.
A Frame Property inspector appears for the selected frame. If the
inspector doesn’t appear, open it by choosing Window➪Properties.

Structuring Pages with Frames
104
3. In the Frame Property inspector or the Attributes tab of the Tag
Inspector panel, enter a name for your frame in the Frame Name text
field.
This name is the name by which the frame is referenced in the Frames
panel, target drop-down lists, and the HTML page code. The frame name
must start with a letter, and you should not use hyphens, spaces, or peri-
ods. You should also avoid using JavaScript-reserved names, such as
top. Although these words and symbols may be accepted, if you are
using any scripting (JavaScript, VBScript) to manipulate your frames,
the results may be inconsistent or wrong. It’s a good idea to get into the
habit of avoiding these words and characters. Word separation can be
indicated by capitalization, and underscore characters can also be used.
4. In the Src text field, enter the name of the source page whose content
you intend to display in the frame.
Alternatively, you can click the Src folder and browse to select the
source page.
5. Select a scrolling option for your selected frame from the Scroll drop-
down list. The options are as follows:
• Yes: Adds scroll bars to the frame, whether they’re needed or not.
• No: Doesn’t add scroll bars to the frame, even if a scroll bar is
needed to display the entire frame.

• Auto: Places one or more scroll bars in the frame if the frame con-
tents exceed the frame boundaries.
• Default: Places one or more scroll bars in the frame, depending on
the user’s browser settings.
6. Select the No Resize check box if you don’t want the user to be able
to resize the frame.
If you do want the user to be able to resize the frame, leave the check
box deselected.
7. Format the frame border appearance by selecting a choice from the
Borders drop-down list:
• Yes: Creates a three-dimensional look for the borders. (This doesn’t
work in all browsers.)
• No: Creates a single-color flat look for the borders, or if No is
selected for each of the frames in a frameset, no border appears.
• Default: Enables the user’s browser to set how borders appear.
8. Select a border color for the frame by clicking the Border Color
swatch and selecting a color from the Color palette that appears.
Alternatively, you can enter a hexadecimal color code in the Border
Color text field. This doesn’t work in all browsers and is optional. If your
frames don’t have borders, then the border color will not apply.
9. Enter a number in pixels in the Margin Width and the Margin Height
text fields.
Margin Width specifies the horizontal standoff space between the frame
content and the frame border. Margin Height specifies the vertical
standoff space between the frame content and the frame border. This
is in addition to any values that the page called into the frame already
has assigned.
Deleting frames
To delete a frame, select the frame border and drag it to the edge of the
parent frame or to the edge of the Document window — whichever is closer.
If you only have two frames on the page, this action will result in a frameset
with only one page in it.
Saving frames
Saving a frame means that you’re saving the HTML page from which the
source content of the frame originates. To save a frame, follow these steps:
1. Select the frame by clicking in it.
2. Choose File➪Save Frame.

Structuring Pages with Frames
106
3. The first time you save the frame, enter a name in the File Name text
field of the Save As dialog box that appears, and then click the Save
button.
Future saves require that you complete only Steps 1 and 2.
Saving framesets
Saving a frameset means saving the layout of frame positions, frame names,
and border formatting on a page. Keep in mind that you must save individ-
ual frames to save the content contained in those frames. To save a frame-
set, follow these steps:
1. Select the frameset by clicking one of its borders.
2. Choose File➪Save Frameset.
Note: This will not work if the frameset is nested.
3. The first time you save the frameset, enter a name in the File Name
text field of the Save As dialog box that appears, and then click Save.
Future saves require that you complete only Steps 1 and 2.
If you have made changes to individual frames — not just the frameset —
since your last save, Dreamweaver asks if you want to save individual
frames. Make sure that you do so.
Setting no-frames content
Text-based browsers and many older browsers frequently don’t support
frames and can’t correctly display pages that you create by using frames.
To help ensure that the maximum number of users can view your page cor-
rectly, Dreamweaver offers you a method for building no-frames pages as
companions to your frame-enabled pages. To create a no-frames page for
your current frameset, follow these steps:
1. Choose Modify➪Frameset➪Edit NoFrames Content.
A blank, NoFrames Content page appears in the Document window and
replaces your frame-enabled page, as shown in Figure 4-4.
2. On the NoFrames Content page, insert the content that you want to
appear in NoFrames browsers.
This content can include text, images, and other page elements.
3. Return to your frame-enabled page by choosing Modify➪Frameset➪
Edit NoFrames Content.

Targeting content
You can set up a two-frame frameset in which you use the left frame for navi-
gation and the main frame to display any link that the user clicks in the navi-
gation frame. Simply set up the link to target the main frame as the location
where you want the selected HTML page to open.
Set up a target by following these steps:
1. Select the text or image that you want to act as a link.
Doing so opens the associated Property inspector. If the inspector doesn’t
appear, open it by choosing Window➪Properties.
2. In the Link field, enter the name of the HTML source page that will
appear in the frame.
Alternatively, you can click the Link folder and browse to select the
source page.
3. From the Target drop-down list, select the target frame where the link
is to appear.
All available targets are listed in the drop-down list, as shown in
Figure 4-5. These targets include the names of all frames that you set
up and also the following system-wide targets:
Figure 4-4:

Structuring Pages with Frames
108
• _blank: Opens a new browser window and shows the link in that
window. The current window remains open.
• _parent: Opens the link in a window that replaces the frameset 
containing the current page.
• _self: Opens the link in the current frame. The linked page replaces
the page in the current frame. If you want the link to open in the 
current frame, you can select _self, or you can leave the Target
area in the Property inspector empty.
• _top: Opens the link in a window that replaces the outermost frame-
set of the current page. (Same as _parent, unless you’re using
nested framesets.)
Targeting can work in more complicated framesets using the same basic
process. Whichever frame you target is the one that will update when the
user clicks a link targeting that frame.

 Placing objects in a layer
 Changing layer properties
 Nesting layers
T
o lay out the content of your Web page precisely, you can use tables
(see Book II, Chapter 2), or you can use the latest and greatest layout
aid: layers. You can think of layers in Dreamweaver MX 2004 as separate
pieces of transparent paper that you fill with content (images, text, and so
on) and shuffle, stack, position, and overlap until your Web page looks
exactly the way you want.
Dreamweaver layers use a now common companion to HTML called
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) in order to place your content anywhere
on the screen. However, you should be aware that Cascading Style Sheets
are only supported in Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator versions
above 4.0. For more information about Cascading Style Sheets, check out
Cascading Style Sheets For Dummies, by Damon Dean (published by Wiley
Publishing, Inc.).
Before you begin working with layers, you may find it useful to have the
Design panel open to the Layers tab. To do this, choose Window➪Layers,
or if you’re in hurry, simply press F2.
Adding a Layer
Adding a layer to the workspace of your Document window, shown in
Figure 5-1, can be done using one of the following two methods:

Selecting a Layer
110
✦Choose Insert➪Layout Objects➪Layer. If there is nothing on the page
already, as in this case, a new layer appears in the upper-left corner of
your Document window.
✦Click the Draw Layer button ( just to the left of the Standard button)
on the Layout category of the Insert bar. (If the Insert bar is not set to
the Layout category, click the category name and choose Layout from
the drop-down list.) Position the cross hair cursor anywhere in your
Document window and click and drag until the layer obtains the dimen-
sions you want. Release the mouse button.
If you set a layer’s visibility to Hidden, it may be invisible in the Document
window. To see it, simply click the name of the layer in the Layers tab of the
Design panel. Now you can see the layer, even though its visibility remains
set to Hidden. See the “Changing the visibility of a layer” section, later in
this chapter, for details on Visibility settings.
Selecting a Layer
Selecting a layer enables you to identify which layer you want to affect when
executing a layer operation, such as moving or naming the layer. Use any of
the following methods to select a layer:
Figure 5-1:
Adding a
layer to the
Document
window.

Book II
Chapter 5
Laying Out Pages
with Layers
Changing Layer Properties
111
✦In the Document window, click on the boundary of the layer. (Your
cursor will turn into a four-pointed arrow when you place it over a
layer boundary.)
✦In the Document window, click anywhere inside the layer while holding
down the Shift key. (Note: This won’t work if the insertion point is
already inside the layer you want to select.)
✦In the Layers tab of the Design panel, click the name of the layer.
Selection handles appear on the boundary of the layer to indicate that you
have selected it.
Deleting a Layer
Deleting a layer removes the layer, the layer’s contents, and the layer
marker from the Document window. To delete a layer, select the layer and
press the Delete or Backspace key.
Don’t delete a layer if you want to remove it from one page and add it to
another. Instead, cut the layer by choosing Edit➪Cut. Open the page where
you want to add the layer and choose Edit➪Paste.
Placing Objects in a Layer
To add an object to a layer, click inside the layer and follow the normal pro-
cedure for adding the object. For instance, add text to a layer by clicking
inside the layer and typing text; add other objects to a layer by clicking
inside the layer and choosing Insert➪Object, where Object is the name of the
item you want to add to the layer.
Changing Layer Properties
You can change lots of properties of layers, including:
✦Background: You can add a background image or color to a layer.
✦Name: Naming a layer can help you keep track of objects on a complex
page, and is necessary if you want to apply Behaviors to the layer.
✦Alignment: You can align layers with each other.
✦Visibility: Layers (and the objects on them) can be visible or invisible.

Changing Layer Properties
112
✦Position: Layers can be nested inside other layers; they can also be
stacked in different orders.
✦Size: You can change the layer’s height and width.
✦Location: You can move a layer to any location on a page.
We show you how to edit each of these layer properties in the following 
sections.
Including a background image or color in a layer
By default, an unnested layer does not have a color or background image,
and will just display what lies beneath it, as if it were transparent. (A nested
child layer, if it’s empty, will show the color or background image of its
parent. For more about nested layers, see the section, “Nesting Layers,”
later in this chapter.)
You can change the background of any layer by adding a background image
or color as follows:
1. Select the layer that you want to change the background of.
If the Layer Property inspector does not appear, open it by choosing
Window➪Properties.
2. In the Layer Property inspector, change one of the following:
• Bg Image: Click the folder to the right of the text field and browse to
select a background image from the Select Image Source dialog box
that appears. Click the Select button to accept your image choice
and close the dialog box. The path to and name of the background
image appear in the Bg Image field, and the image is added to the
background of the layer. Figure 5-2 shows a layer with a background
image.
• Bg Color: Click the color box (the little gray box with an arrow on it)
and select a color from the color palette that appears. Alternatively,
you can enter a hexadecimal number for a color in the Bg Color field.
The new color appears in the background of the selected layer.
Naming a layer
The first layer you add to a page is automatically named Layer1; the second
layer you add is named Layer2; and so on. You can change these default
number names to other names that help you more easily distinguish layers
when working with HTML and examining layers with the Layer Property
inspector or Layers tab of the Design panel.

Book II
Chapter 5

Changing Layer Properties
113
To name a layer using the Layers tab of the Design panel, follow these steps:
1. If the Layers tab of the Design panel is not already visible, choose
Window➪Layers or use the keyboard shortcut F2.
2. Double-click the Name column for the layer whose name you want to
change.
The current name is selected.
3. Enter a new name for the layer.
Get in the habit of appropriately naming your layers as soon as you create
them. The name BlueprintImageMap helps you remember a layer’s content
much better than Layer15. Remember that layer names cannot contain
spaces.
Aligning layers
Aligning layers with each other can help you precisely lay out visual content
in the Document window. You can align the top, left side, right side, or
bottom of layers.
Figure 5-2:
An image
added to a
background.

Changing Layer Properties
114
To align layers, select the layers you want to align by pressing and holding
the Shift key, and then clicking each layer in the Document window. Choose
Modify➪Align and choose one of the following options from the submenu:
✦Left: Assigns the x-coordinate of the last selected layer to all selected
layers.
✦Right: Aligns the right side of all selected layers with the right side of
the last selected layer.
✦Top: Assigns the y-coordinate of the last selected layer to all selected
layers.
✦Bottom: Aligns the bottom of all selected layers with the bottom of the
last selected layer.
✦Make Same Width: Gives all the layers the same width as the last
selected layer.
✦Make Same Height: Gives all the layers the same height as the last
selected layer.
Changing the visibility of a layer
You can specify whether a layer is visible or hidden when a Web page loads —
first appears in the user’s browser window — and as a result of specific
actions by the user. Visibility can change as many times as you want. Visibility
options consist of the following:
✦Default: The layer’s initial visibility is the default setting, which is visi-
ble. To edit layer default settings, choose Edit➪Preferences and the
Preferences dialog box (see Figure 5-3) appears, displaying the layer
default settings that you can change.
Figure 5-3:
Setting your

for layers.

Book II
Chapter 5

Changing Layer Properties
115
✦Inherit: For a nested layer, the layer’s initial visibility is the same as the
visibility of its parent. For an unnested layer, selecting the inherit option
causes the layer to appear as visible.
✦Visible: The layer’s initial visibility setting is visible.
✦Hidden: The layer’s initial visibility is hidden.
You can use either the Layer Property inspector or the Layers tab of the
Design panel to set layer visibility. By setting layer visibility, you can create
scripts that cause images to appear (or disappear) in response to user inter-
action. For example, you can create an image of a widget that appears on a
Web page after a user clicks a link marked, Click here to see our top-of-the-
line widget!
To set the initial visibility of a layer via the Layer Property inspector, select
the layer in the Document window to open the Layer Property inspector. If
the inspector does not appear, open it by choosing Window➪Properties.
Choose a visibility option from the Vis drop-down list.
Layering layers: Setting the z-index
The z-index of a layer indicates the layer’s position in a stack of multiple
layers. Z-indices are useful when you have a handful of layers — some con-
taining transparent portions, some of different sizes — stacked one on top of
the other. Changing the z-index of your layers lets you “shuffle” the layers —
much as you shuffle a deck of cards — to create interesting visual effects.
Z-indices are measured in whole numbers and do not have to be 
consecutive — for instance, you can have three layers with z-indices of
1, 3, and 7, respectively. The layer with the largest z-index sits on top of
the layer stack, and the layer with the smallest z-index sits on the bottom
of the layer stack. Layers with larger z-indices obscure those with smaller 
z-indices. You can change the z-index of a layer in either the Layer Property
inspector or the Layers tab of the Design panel.
To assign the z-index of a layer by using the Layer Property inspector, follow
these steps:
1. Select the layer to open the Layer Property inspector.
If the Layer Property inspector does not appear, open it by choosing
Window➪Properties.
2. Enter a new number in the Z-Index field of the Layer Property 
inspector.

Changing Layer Properties
116
To assign the z-index of a layer using the Layers tab of the Design panel,
follow these steps:
1. If the Layers tab of the Design panel is not already visible, choose
Window➪Layers or use the keyboard shortcut F2.
2. Click the Z column for the layer whose z-index you want to change.
The current z-index is selected.
3. Enter a new z-index for the layer.
The new number appears in the Z column for the selected layer, as
shown in Figure 5-4.
4. Click anywhere outside the Z column or press the Enter key.
Note that you can have multiple layers at the same z-index.
To assign relative z-indices to layers by reordering layers in the Layers tab
of the Design panel, follow these steps:
1. Open the Layers tab of the Design panel by choosing Window➪Layers
or by using the keyboard shortcut F2.
The Layers tab lists layers in order of descending z-index. Nested layers
are listed in descending order within their parent layer.
2. Click the name of a layer for which you want to change the z-index.
3. Drag the layer name into a new list position and release the mouse
button.
As you drag, the selected layer is indicated by a thick line.
Figure 5-5 shows the effect of changing a z-index. In the top image, the z-index
of the bowling pins is higher than the starry background image. As a result,
the bowling pins are on top. Conversely, in the bottom image, the starry back-
ground image has the higher z-index value, and as a result, it’s on top of the
bowling pins. Dreamweaver reorders the list in the Layers tab and renumbers
layer z-indices to reflect your change. Also, Dreamweaver updates the associ-
ated code for the layers’ z-indices in the HTML source code for your page.
Figure 5-4:

Because you don’t have to number the z-index of layers consecutively, con-
sider leaving gaps between indices, in case you later want to add new layers
into the middle of the stack. For instance, use only even numbers for your
indices so that you can easily sandwich a layer with an odd-numbered 
z-index in between.
Moving a layer
You may want to move a layer to another location in the Document window
or to a position relative to the grid or to other objects.
To move a layer, select the layer in the Document window and then reposi-
tion your selection by using one of the following three methods:
✦Click and drag the layer to a new location and release the mouse button.
✦Press the arrow keys you find on the numeric keypad on your keyboard
to nudge the layer up, down, left, or right one pixel at a time. If you hold
down the Shift key, every press of an arrow key moves the layer by
10 pixels.
Figure 5-5:

z-indices.

Nesting Layers
118
✦In the Layer Property inspector, enter a new value in the T (top) and L
(left) fields to indicate the pixel coordinates of the layer’s top-left
corner.
When moving layers, you can choose to enable or prevent layer overlap,
depending on how you want the final image montage to appear. You enable
or prevent layer overlap by selecting or deselecting the Prevent Overlaps
check box in the Layers tab of the Design panel.
Resizing a layer
Resizing a layer means changing its height and width dimensions. To resize
a layer, select the layer and perform one of the following tasks:
✦Click and drag a selection handle — one of the large dots on the layer
boundary — until the layer obtains the dimensions you desire.
✦In the Layer Property inspector, enter a new width in pixels at the W
field and a new height in pixels at the H field. If the Layer Property
inspector does not appear, open it by choosing Window➪Properties.
You can change the height and width dimensions of multiple layers at the
same time as follows:
1. Press and hold the Shift key while selecting each layer you want to
resize.
If the Multiple Layers Property inspector does not appear, open it by
choosing Window➪Properties.
2. In the Multiple Layers Property inspector, enter a new width in pixels
in the W field and a new height in pixels in the H field.
Nesting Layers
A nested layer is a layer that has all of its HTML code lying within another
layer. The nested layer is often referred to as a child layer, whereas the layer
on which it depends is called the parent layer. A child layer can be drawn
completely inside its parent (as shown in Figure 5-6), in an intersecting
arrangement with its parent, or completely unattached to its parent,
depending on the effect you want to achieve. A nested layer inherits the
same visibility of its parent and moves with the parent when the parent
layer is repositioned in the Document window. Some versions of Netscape
have issues with nested layers, so try to avoid using them if there is a sim-
pler way to accomplish the same thing.

119
Enabling nesting
To create nested layers in the Document window, you must first enable nest-
ing. To do so, follow these steps:
1. Choose Edit➪Preferences to open the Preferences dialog box or use
the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+U.
2. In the Preferences dialog box, select Layers in the Category area.
3. Select the Nesting check box.
4. Click OK to close the Preferences dialog box.
5. In the Document window, choose Window➪Layers to open the Layers
tab of the Design panel.
6. In the Layers tab, make sure that the Prevent Overlaps option is 
deselected.
Creating a new nested layer
Use either of these methods to draw a nested layer after enabling nesting:
✦Click inside an existing layer and choose Insert➪Layout Objects➪Layer.
A child layer of default size appears inside the parent layer.
Figure 5-6:

Nesting Layers
120
✦Select Layout Tools➪Draw Layer in the Layout category of the Insert
bar. Then click and drag your mouse in the parent layer, releasing the
mouse button when the layer has reached the dimensions you desire.
If the dimensions of the parent layer are smaller than the dimensions of the
child layer, the child layer will exceed the boundaries of the parent.
Nesting an existing layer
To change the nesting of an existing layer, follow these steps:
1. Open the Layers tab of the Design panel by choosing Window➪Layers
or using the keyboard shortcut F2.
2. In the Layers tab of the Design panel, press and hold the Ctrl key
while using the mouse to click and drag the intended child layer on
top of its new parent.
The child is in the correct position when you see a box appear around
the name of its intended parent layer.
3. Release the mouse button.
The new child-parent relationship is shown in the Layers tab of the
Design panel.
Dreamweaver draws the new child layer and updates the associated code
for changed layer-nesting in the HTML source code for your page.
Collapsing or expanding your view in the Layers tab
You can change how you view the names of nested layers in the Layers tab
of the Design panel by collapsing or expanding your view:
✦To collapse your view: Click the minus sign (–) in front of a parent layer.
Names of nested child layers for that parent are hidden.
✦To expand your view: Click the plus sign (+) in front of a parent layer.
Names of nested child layers appear underneath that parent layer.

O
ne of the biggest changes that came with the previous version of
Macromedia Studio was the integration of ColdFusion MX into
Dreamweaver MX. For years, the two products had a symbiotic relationship,
and as a result, their integration was an exceptionally smooth one.
Dreamweaver was always better than ColdFusion as a graphical HTML
editor. ColdFusion and its sister product, Macromedia HomeSite, were the
better choices for the HTML editor who preferred a coder-friendly interface.
This chapter provides the lowdown on the features in Dreamweaver that
bring ColdFusion to life.
This chapter only covers the ColdFusion features that are available in
Dreamweaver. For a complete run-down of ColdFusion and how it works,
check out Book VI.
Understanding the Integration of
ColdFusion and Dreamweaver
Before the MX version, Dreamweaver was largely geared toward the basics
of HTML editing, such as creating and editing tables, graphics placement,
text editing, and some basic site management tools. With the integration of
ColdFusion, Dreamweaver became more robust, with a host of features that
could make your site more dynamic.

Understanding the Integration of ColdFusion and Dreamweaver
122
Before Dreamweaver MX arrived, ColdFusion was made up of three 
components:
✦A Web-based application server that read HTML and ColdFusion code
and generated HTML for a browser to view.
✦A scripting language that enabled users to perform a number of
dynamic functions, such as querying databases and personalizing Web
pages based on user input.
✦A stand-alone development tool (ColdFusion Studio) that was used to
create ColdFusion code and manage some parts of the application
server.
In the previous version of Dreamweaver, ColdFusion Studio was simply 
integrated into the Dreamweaver interface. This resulted in a single
product that incorporates both the WYSIWYG (What You See Is What
You Get) interface that Dreamweaver users are accustomed to and the
more developer-friendly ColdFusion Studio code environment. The other
elements of ColdFusion remained largely the same.
In Dreamweaver, you can find ColdFusion features in the following areas:
✦Code view: Select Code view by choosing View➪Code. This is the devel-
opment view that was traditionally associated with ColdFusion Studio.
Figure 6-1 shows both the view from ColdFusion Studio 5 and the Code
view in Dreamweaver MX 2004. You can see that a lot of the physical 
features look the same.
✦Insert bar: If you’ve used the previous version of Dreamweaver, you’ll
notice a major interface change in the Insert function in Dreamweaver
MX 2004. In the previous version, there was an Insert panel that utilized
tabs to jump from section to section. In Dreamweaver MX 2004, when
you click the name at the far left on the Insert bar, a listing of all the
available sections (what Macromedia calls “categories”) pops up. Scroll
up or down and select a name to see the buttons in that category of the
Insert bar. You find ColdFusion-specific functions in the Common, CFML,
and Application categories.
✦Application panel: To bring up the Application panel, choose Window,
and then any of the following: Database, Bindings, Server Behaviors,
or Components. This brings up the Application panel with the appropri-
ate tab selected. Within the Application panel, you can configure data-
bases, set up links to your remote site, and create ColdFusion
components.

124
✦Code panel: The Code panel, not to be confused with Code view, pro-
vides some valuable reference information about your code. (The Code
panel is shown in Figure 6-2.) You can bring up the panel by choosing
either Snippets or Reference from the Window menu:
• Snippets tab: With the Snippets tab, you can create reusable chunks
(snippets) of code.
• Reference tab: The Reference tab gives you access to O’Reilly’s ref-
erence guides to HTML, Javascript, and more, as well as guides to
ColdFusion, ASP, and JSP.
In previous versions of Dreamweaver, Code view also included a 
Tag Inspector, which reviewed the quality of your HTML code. That function
is still there, though in Dreamweaver MX 2004, this feature has been given its
own floating panel. You can still get to it by selecting Window➪Code
Inspector.
Using Features on the Insert Bar
When you have a ColdFusion page open, the Insert bar gives you access to a
number of ColdFusion features, and using those ColdFusion features is
pretty straightforward. Almost all the features include a Help button to
explain to you precisely what the feature does.
To insert a ColdFusion feature, you follow these steps:
1. Select the category in the Insert bar for the element you want to
insert.
You can choose from three ColdFusion categories: Common, CFML
(ColdFusion Markup Language), and Application. The other categories
are for regular Dreamweaver features.
Figure 6-2:
The Code
panel.

Book II
Chapter 6
Using Features on the Insert Bar
125
2. Click the icon of the feature you want to insert.
If the feature has parameters that need to be set, a dialog box will
appear that allows you to set all the parameters for the selected feature.
Figure 6-3 shows a dialog box for a Cfquery tag (with Cfquery, you can
retrieve information from a database). For more information on how to
use all these features, check out Book VI.
If you move your mouse over an icon and keep it there, the name of the
feature appears over the icon, allowing you to see what function that
icon serves.
3. Enter all the pertinent information in the dialog box for the element
that you selected in Step 2.
Again, the information you must enter varies, depending on which tags
or elements you selected.
4. Click OK to insert the element.
In Dreamweaver MX 2004, the ColdFusion commands have been consolidated
from five tabs in the Insert panel to just three categories on the Insert bar.
The Common category includes a Tag Chooser button, from which you can
select ColdFusion CFML tags. Beyond that, all the ColdFusion features are
either in the CFML or the Application categories on the Insert bar.
The CFML category includes access to the largest number of CFML tags and
functions. Note that the last two icons on this category are entitled Flow
and Advanced. This is where buttons from the old CFML Flow and CFML
Advanced tabs landed. If you click these icons, you get pop-up menus,
shown in Figure 6-4, which reveal a number of other functions that you can
include in your documents. Here’s a complete listing of the buttons in the
CFML category:

Editing a Tag
128
Figure 6-5 shows the Application category of the Insert bar in Dreamweaver,
which allows you to access the following ColdFusion features:
✦Recordset: Allows you to connect to a database and retrieve data from
that database and creates the <CFQUERY> tag for you
✦Stored Procedure: Allows you to execute a stored procedure against an
SQL database and specify parameters to be passed as part of that call
✦Dynamic Data: Creates either dynamic text or a table, or populates vari-
ous form elements with data from a database
✦Repeated Region: Enables you to create a repeated region
✦Show Region: Enables you to show or not show a specific area of content
based on a set of criteria
✦Recordset Paging: Creates dynamic page-scrolling arrows for a 
recordset
✦Display Record Count: Shows how many records you have from a
given query — first, last, and total number
✦Master Detail Page Set: Creates a master detail page
✦Insert Record: Creates a form to insert a database record
✦Update Record: Creates a form to update a database record
✦Delete Record: Creates a form to delete a database record
✦User Authentication: Provides a series of tools to log a user in or out,
or to restrict access to a page
Editing a Tag
After you’ve inserted a tag into your ColdFusion code, you may need to edit
that tag. You can edit the code directly, or you can use the Tag Editor, which
provides a cleaner way to see all the parameters for your tag. (Note: Not all
Figure 6-5:
Getting

features.

Book II
Chapter 6
Getting Data from a Database
129
tags have this option. If you don’t see Edit Tag in Step 3, then you know the
tag you’re working with doesn’t support this feature.) To use the Tag Editor,
follow these steps:
1. If necessary, switch to the Code view in the Document window by
choosing View➪Code.
2. Place your cursor anywhere in the opening tag you want to edit.
3. Right-click and choose Edit Tag from the contextual menu.
The Edit Tag dialog box appears.
4. Change the value in the dialog box, and then click OK to update
the tag.
The value changes, depending on which tag you’re editing.
Getting Data from a Database
You can set up a database connection using the ColdFusion Administrator,
as described in Book VI, Chapter 6. Using the Dreamweaver interface, how-
ever, you can look directly into a database to see the tables and columns
that make up a database when you’re in Code view. More importantly, you
can then easily add those tables and columns to your ColdFusion code
simply by dragging them onto the screen. Here’s how:
1. Open the Application panel to the Databases tab by choosing
Window➪Database.
You see a list of the databases on your testing server. For this example,
we use the CompanyInfo database, one of the sample databases that
comes with ColdFusion.
2. Click the plus (+) button next to the CompanyInfo database.
This shows you the views, tables, and stored procedures for the 
database.
3. Expand the Employee table by clicking the plus (+) buttons next to
the first Tables and then the Employee table.
All the columns in the table should now be visible, as shown in Figure 6-6.
4. Click and drag the LastName column from the panel onto the work
area.
You see that this adds the column name to the work area.
Using
ColdFusion MX 6.1

Getting Data from a Database
130
For the feature described in the previous steps to work, you need to have an
active testing server configured, and you need to know the Remote Data
Services password for your testing server. Check out Book VI, Chapter 2 for
more information.
Now, by itself, this doesn’t really accomplish a whole lot. All you’ve really
done is drag a column name onto your work area. To really see it in action,
try adding the following code text to your page, in between the <BODY> tags:
<CFQUERY name=”DatabaseTest” datasource=”CompanyInfo”>
select LastName from Employee
</CFQUERY>
<CFOUTPUT query=”DatabaseTest”>
#lastname#<BR>
</CFOUTPUT>
Now, press the F12 key to preview the page in a Web browser, and you see a
whole list of last names, as shown in Figure 6-7. If you’d like, try adding
some other fields in the code between select and from, making sure that
the fields are all separated by commas. If you then add the field name to
CFOUTPUT, surrounded by pound signs (#), you see those fields displayed as
well. For more information on accessing data from a database using
ColdFusion, check out Book VI, Chapter 3.

Using the Bindings Tab
131
Using the Bindings Tab
The Bindings tab of the Application panel provides another interface to data
sources, and for someone unaccustomed to working with ColdFusion, it is an
easy way to begin to understand CFML. Binding, in the Dreamweaver vernac-
ular, is just a link between the page and some other datasource that provides
data to the page. With this interface, you can build the same query we used
in the example in the previous section, “Getting Data from a Database,” as 
follows:
1. Press Ctrl+N; in the New Page dialog box that appears, select
Dynamic Page and ColdFusion, and then click the Create button.
This creates a new ColdFusion document.
2. Save the document into a site that has a remote server configured to
see the sample ColdFusion databases.
3. Switch to the Bindings tab by choosing Window➪Bindings.
4. Click the plus (+) button and select Recordset (Query) from the drop-
down list.
The Recordset dialog box, shown in Figure 6-8, appears.
5. Type a name, such as DatabaseTest, into the Name field.
Figure 6-7:

names from

Using the Bindings Tab
132
6. Select CompanyInfo from the Data Source drop-down list.
You may also need to input the username and password for the testing
server. If you configured the remote testing server, then you should
know the username and password. If not, then you may need to check
with your organization’s database administrator.
7. Select the Employee table from the Table drop-down list.
8. Select the radio button labeled Selected from the Columns option,
and choose LastName from the scroll list (it will show up when you
select the radio button).
9. Leave the Filter and Sort fields set to None.
These two tools, which you should try as you get more comfortable
with using the Bindings tab, allow you to further refine and sort the data
from the Employee table.
10. Click OK to add the Binding.
Dreamweaver adds a new record in the Bindings tab and the following
code to the Code view:
<CFQUERY name=”DatabaseTest” datasource=”CompanyInfo”>
SELECT LastName FROM Employee
</CFQUERY>
This code tells the server to get all the last names from the Employee
table in the CompanyInfo database. When the page is read, this query
retrieves the data and makes it available to be output.
11. To make the last names output when the page is loaded, click and
drag the LastName lightning bolt icon from the Bindings tab on the
Application panel to the Document window.
Figure 6-8:

Recordset
dialog box.

Book II
Chapter 6
Introducing Server Behaviors and Components
133
Dreamweaver creates the following code and adds it to your workspace:
<CFOUTPUT query=”DatabaseTest”>
#DatabaseTest.LastName#
</CFOUTPUT>
This tells ColdFusion to display the LastNames (all of them) when the
page is loaded.
12. Press F12 to preview the page.
When the page loads, you’ll notice that the names are output one right
after another without anything in between them. You can add a line
break (<BR>) or a comma after #DatabaseTest.LastName#, and
ColdFusion will add the comma or line break after every record.
Queries are only one kind of Binding that Dreamweaver supports. You can
see all the others when you click the plus (+) button on the Bindings tab. As
you become more familiar with ColdFusion, you’ll no doubt want to use
some of these other kinds of Bindings, notably the Stored Procedure and the
Form, Session, Client, and Application variables.
Introducing Server Behaviors and Components
The Server Behavior and Components tabs in the Application panel are 
similar in both design and concept to the Bindings panel. The following 
sections cover them only cursorily, because to use these tools to their
fullest extent, you need an advanced working knowledge of ColdFusion
and code development.
Understanding server behaviors
Server behaviors are code elements that make a request to the ColdFusion
Server and receive some sort of data in return. If that sounds similar to the
preceding Bindings example, it is! You can do that Recordset example from
the earlier section, “Using the Bindings Tab,” in the Server Behaviors tab.
However, a number of more advanced server behaviors are beyond simple
queries that you can do from this tab. Table 6-1 describes each of the server
behaviors that Dreamweaver offers.

Considering components
Components are reusable bits of ColdFusion code that can be used through-
out your Dreamweaver Site. Dreamweaver comes with a number of sample
components to show you how they work. In practical terms, though, you
create your own components based on the needs of your site.
Suppose that you’re building a site that sells boxes online, and you have a
tool that calculates the volume of the various types of boxes that you sell.
Because it’s used globally by the site, this tool shouldn’t be repeated in
every single ColdFusion page. Instead, it should be in an area where all
pages can access it and just pass along the value obtained by performing a
calculation. If you built it as a component, this calculator could be accessed
anywhere, and if there are ever any changes to the tool (say you changed
from cubic feet to cubic meters), you’d only need to make the change once,
instead of many times.
The Components tab provides developers with a framework for building
these kinds of tools. From this tab, you can specify the following for a new
component:
✦General information about the component (such as its name and where
it’s located)
✦Properties of the component (queries, arrays, strings, and so on)
✦The functions associated with the component
✦The arguments (data) the component will accept from another page or
form

I
n previous chapters of Book II, we focus on providing a good working
knowledge of Dreamweaver MX 2004. Now we need to spend some time
looking at the more advanced uses of Dreamweaver in Web development. In
this chapter, we show you how to make images a bit more striking and how
you can bring some other multimedia elements to life.
Creating Clickable Image Maps with Hotspots
You can designate certain areas of an image as hotspots — active areas that
a user can click to open a link to another Web page or activate some other
behavior. Hotspots can be shaped like rectangles, circles, or polygons (irreg-
ular objects). The coordinates of the hotspots are grouped into chunks of
HTML code called image maps.
Creating a hotspot
Check out Figure 7-1. It shows a typical navigation bar for a site as a single
JPEG image. The following procedure shows you how to create an image
map for part of that image by adding hotspots:
1. Select the image to which you want to add a hotspot.
The Image Property inspector appears. If the bottom half of the Image
Property inspector is not visible, click the Expander button, which is
the down arrow in the bottom-right corner.

Creating Clickable Image Maps with Hotspots
136
2. In the Map area of the Image Property inspector, click the Hotspot
button for the shape you want to draw.
You can choose a rectangle, a circle, or a polygon. Your mouse pointer
becomes a cross hair cursor when you move it over the image.
3. Draw the hotspot according to the shape you select:
• Circle or rectangle: Click your cross hair cursor on the image and
drag diagonally to create a hotspot. Release the mouse button
when the hotspot reaches your desired dimensions. The area you
draw is highlighted light blue, and the Hotspot Property inspector
appears.
• Polygon: Click your cross hair cursor on the image once for each
point. The area you draw is highlighted light blue, and the Hotspot
Property inspector appears.
4. In the Hotspot Property inspector, supply the following information:
• Map: Enter a unique name for the image map.
• Link: Enter a URL or the name of an HTML file you want to open
when the user clicks the hotspot. Alternatively, you can click the
folder icon and browse to select the link from your files. Note:
Completing this field is optional. Instead, you may choose to attach
a behavior to the hotspot.
• Behaviors: To attach a behavior other than a link to the hotspot,
open the Behaviors tab of the Tag panel by choosing Window➪
Behaviors or by using the keyboard shortcut Shift+F3. Then click the
Add (+) button in the Behaviors panel, which opens a pop-up menu
of available behaviors, including Check Plugin, Play Sound, Popup
Message, Preload Images, and many others. Choose a behavior from
the pop-up menu, complete the information in the dialog box that
appears for your selected behavior, and click OK.
• Target: Complete this field if you entered a link in the Link field, and
you want the link to open in a window or frame other than the one
you’re linking from. Click the arrow and select from the drop-down
list a target window where you want your selected link to appear.
You can select from the following choices: _blank (opens the link
in a new window), _parent (opens the link in the parent of the

currently opened window; if the currently opened window was
opened from another frame, the link will open in that frame), _self
(the default; opens the link in the currently opened window; not
selecting a Target produces the same effect), and _top (opens the
link in the top-level window, replacing frames, if any). If you have
created frames, you can also select a frame name from this list. (See
Book II, Chapter 4 for more information about frames.)
• Alt: Enter the text you want to show when the user moves the
mouse pointer over the hotspot. Alt text also makes information
about the hotspot accessible to vision-impaired users.
Modifying a hotspot
If you need to change the size or shape of a hotspot after you’ve created it,
or you need to change the link, target, or Alt information for the hotspot,
use the following procedure to edit the hotspot:
1. On an image in the Document window, click the hotspot you want to
modify.
The Hotspot Property inspector appears. If the inspector does not
appear, open it by choosing Window➪Properties.
2. Edit the Link, Target, or Alt information you want to change in the
Hotspot Property inspector.
3. If you want to reshape or resize the hotspot, select the Arrow tool in
the Hotspot Property inspector, and then click any handle of the
selected hotspot and drag the handle to a new location.
4. If you want to reposition the hotspot, select the Arrow tool in the
Hotspot Property inspector, and then click anywhere within the
hotspot and drag it to a new location.
5. You can delete a hotspot by selecting it and pressing the Delete key
on your keyboard.
Adding Flash Text Rollovers
A text rollover is text that changes color when users move their mouse
pointer over it. (One color appears to “roll over” to the next color.) One way
to create text rollovers in Dreamweaver is by adding Flash text to your
pages, as described in the following section.
Flash text and Flash buttons are so called because Dreamweaver implements
these features using the same code that Macromedia Flash MX 2004 (the ani-
mation program included in the Macromedia Studio MX 2004 suite) uses.

Adding Flash Text Rollovers

Adding Flash text
To add hyperlinked Flash text that changes color when users roll their
mouse over it, follow these steps:
1. Click in the Document window where you want to add Flash text.
2. Choose Insert➪Media➪Flash Text.
Your page must be saved before you can insert Flash text. If the page
hasn’t been saved at least once, an alert pops up to remind you to save
the page so you can insert the Flash text.
3. In the Insert Flash Text dialog box, shown in Figure 7-2, select a font
from the Font drop-down list.
4. Enter a point size for your text in the Size text field.
5. If you want, you can also format the text.
You can click the Bold button and/or Italics button. You can also click
an alignment button. Alignment choices are Left, Center, and Right.
6. Select a Color (initial color) and a Rollover Color (color the text
changes to when users move their mouse pointer over it) by clicking
the color swatch in each area and selecting a color from the color
palette that appears.
7. Enter your text in the Text field. Select the Show Font option if you
want to view the characters in the Text field in your selected font.

or you can select from the following choices:
• _blank: Opens the link in a new window.
• _parent: Opens the link in the parent of the currently opened window.
• _self: Opens the link in the currently opened window; this is the
default. Leaving the Target area empty produces the same result.
• _top: Opens the link in the top-level window, replacing frames, if any.
10. Select a Background color by clicking the Bg Color swatch and select-
ing a color from the color palette that appears, or type in a hexadeci-
mal number.
Your Flash text appears over the background color you choose.
11. Enter a name for your Flash text component in the Save As field or
click the Browse button to select a name from your files.
You must save Flash text with an .swf extension.
12. Click OK to create your Flash text and close the dialog box.
To preview the rollover effect of your Flash text, select the Flash object in
the Document window to open the Flash Text Property inspector. In the
Property inspector, click the Play button to view your Flash text as it will
appear in the browser window. Click the Stop button when you’re done.
Changing Flash text
You can change an existing Flash text object by simply double-clicking the
object in the Document window, or by clicking the object, and then clicking
the Edit button in the Property inspector. Doing so opens the Insert Flash
Text dialog box, where you can change various attributes of the object as we
describe in the previous section.
Adding Flash Button Rollovers
Buttons that change appearance when users move their mouse pointer over
them — called button rollovers — are so popular that Dreamweaver gives
you a way to create them quickly and easily as Flash movies. To find out

Adding Flash Button Rollovers

how to create button rollovers using images and behaviors instead of Flash
button rollovers, see the “Inserting Image Rollovers” section, later in this
chapter. (Book III, Chapter 5 describes how to make rollovers in Fireworks
MX 2004 using images and behaviors.)
Adding a Flash button
To add a Flash button, follow these steps:
1. Click in the Document window where you want to add a Flash button.
2. Choose Insert➪Media➪Flash Button to open the Insert Flash Button
dialog box, as shown in Figure 7-3.
Your page must be saved before you can insert a Flash button. If the
page hasn’t been saved at least once, an alert pops up to remind you to
save the page so you can insert the Flash button.
3. In the Insert Flash Button dialog box, scroll through the button selec-
tions in the Style list and click to select a style.
You can preview the style in the Sample area of the dialog box — just
point to the sample with your mouse to see the Flash button in action.
You can get new Flash buttons on the Macromedia Dreamweaver MX 2004
Web site by clicking the Get More Styles button in the Insert Flash Button
dialog box. A Web page on Macromedia’s site opens in your browser.
Select the Flash Media option from the Categories drop-down list and

4. If your selected button has a placeholder for text, enter the text that
you want to appear on the button in the Button Text field.
Text centers within the button automatically. Button size is fixed, though,
so you must make sure your text is brief enough to fit on the button.
5. Select a font for your Flash button text from the Font drop-down list.
6. Enter a point size for your text in the Size field.
7. In the Link field, enter a URL or the name for the page that you want
to appear when the user clicks the Flash button.
Alternatively, you can click the Browse button to select a page from
your files.
8. From the Target drop-down list, select a target window where the
linked page will appear.
If you have created frames, you can select a frame name from this list,
or you can select from the following choices:
• _blank: Opens the link in a new window.
• _parent: Opens the link in the parent of the currently opened
window.
• _self: Opens the link in the currently opened window; this is the
default. Leaving the Target area empty produces the same result.
• _top: Opens the link in the top-level window, replacing frames,
if any.
9. Select a Background color by clicking the Bg Color swatch and select-
ing a color from the color palette that appears.
Alternatively, you can enter a hexadecimal color code in the Bg Color
field.
Your Flash button displays with the background color you select.
10. Enter a name for your Flash button in the Save As field or click the
Browse button to select a name from your files.
The Flash button filename requires an .swf extension. Dreamweaver
will add the extension automatically if you don’t enter it.
11. Click OK to create your Flash button and close the dialog box.
To see what a Flash button looks like in action, select the button in the
Document window to open the Flash Button Property inspector. In the
Property inspector, click the Play button to view your Flash button as it
appears in the browser window. Click the Stop button when you finish.

Changing a Flash button
To change an existing Flash button object, simply double-click the object in
the Document window, or click the object, and then click the Edit button in
the Property inspector. Doing so opens the Insert Flash Button dialog box,
where you can change your button as we describe in the previous section.
Inserting Image Rollovers
An image rollover (often just referred to as a rollover) is a behavior that
changes an image whenever users move their mouse pointer over the
image. Rollovers add interactivity to a Web page by helping users to see
what parts of the page are links to other Web pages.
A rollover is actually two images — one for normal display on a page (the
original image) and one that is slightly modified for display when the image
is rolled over (the rollover image). You can modify an image by changing
the color or position, adding a glow or a shadow, or you can add another
graphic — such as a dog changing from sleeping to wide-awake. For a
rollover to work best, the normal and rollover states of the image should
share the same width and height.
As with all images, you can’t create the original image or the rollover image
directly in Dreamweaver; you must use an image-editing program, such as
Fireworks, to generate the images.
Insert a rollover by following these steps:
1. Click inside the Document window where you want to insert the
image rollover.
2. On the Common category of the Insert bar, click and hold the Image
button and select Rollover Image from the pop-up menu.
The Insert Rollover Image dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 7-4.
Alternatively, you can select Insert➪Image Objects➪Rollover Image.
3. In the Insert Rollover Image dialog box, enter a unique name for the
rollover in the Image Name field, making sure there are no spaces in
the name.
The rollover is referred to by this name in the HTML page code. Keep
in mind that this rollover name refers to the combined original image/
rollover image pair.
4. Enter the name of the original image file in the Original Image field
or click the Browse button to select an image from your files.
The original image appears on the page when the user’s mouse pointer
is not over the image.

5. Enter the name of the rollover image file in the Rollover Image field
or click the Browse button to select an image from your files.
The rollover image appears on the page when the user’s mouse pointer
is over the image.
6. Select the Preload Rollover Image check box.
This feature makes the rollover action appear without delay to users as
they move the mouse pointer over the original image. It is selected by
default.
7. Enter Alternate text for the image to make it accessible to vision-
impaired visitors to your site.
This step is optional but recommended.
8. If you want to make the rollover image a link, enter a URL of the page
in the When Clicked, Go to URL text field.
Alternatively, you can click the Browse button to select a page from
your files.
9. Click OK to accept your choices and close the dialog box.
To check the rollover, preview your page in a browser by choosing File➪
Preview in Browser or by clicking the Preview in Browser button, and then
use your mouse to point to the original image. You can also press F12 to 
preview in the default preview browser. If you haven’t set a default preview
browser, you will have to do so using the Preview in Browser category in
Dreamweaver’s Preferences dialog box. See Dreamweaver’s help documenta-
tion for details.
Setting Up a Navigation Bar
A navigation bar is a group of buttons that users can access to move
throughout your Web site. Buttons within a navigation bar may present
users with options, such as moving backwards, moving forwards, returning
to the home page, or jumping to specific pages within the site.
Figure 7-4:
Creating
an image
rollover.

Setting Up a Navigation Bar
144
Each button in a navigation bar possesses properties similar to a rollover in
that the button changes state — or appears differently — based on where
the user is positioning the mouse pointer. However, a navigation bar button
can possess as many as four different states:
✦Up: The original state of the button
✦Over: How the button appears when a user moves their mouse pointer
over it
✦Down: How the button appears as a user is clicking it
✦Over While Down: How the button appears when the user moves
their mouse pointer over it after clicking it and arriving on the page it
represents
A navigation bar differs from individual rollovers in that clicking a naviga-
tion bar button in the Down state causes all other buttons in the bar to
revert to the Up state.
To create a navigation bar, just follow these steps:
1. Select the Navigation Bar button from the Common category of the
Insert bar or choose Insert➪Image Objects➪Navigation Bar.
Whichever method you choose, the Insert Navigation Bar dialog box
appears, as shown in Figure 7-5.
2. In the Insert Navigation Bar dialog box, enter a name for the first
button in the Element Name field.
The new button appears in the Nav Bar Elements field. Don’t use spaces
in the naming of any of these elements.

3. For each state of the button — Up Image, Over Image, Down Image,
and Over While Down Image — enter the name of the image file that
you want to use in the associated field.
Alternatively, you can click the Browse button for each field and select
an image from your files. You must supply the Up Image. All other states
are optional and can be left blank.
You don’t need to use all four navigation bar button states — creating
only Up and Down states works just fine.
4. Enter Alternate text for the image to make it accessible to vision-
impaired visitors to your site.
This step is optional but recommended.
5. In the When Clicked, Go to URL text field, enter a URL or the name for
the page you want to appear when the user clicks the navigation bar
button.
Alternatively, you can click the Browse button to select a page from
your files.
6. From the In drop-down list, select a target window where you want
the linked page to appear.
If you aren’t using frames, the only option is to use the Main window.
7. Click the Add Item (+) button to add another navigation bar button.
Repeat Steps 2 through 6 to format the new button.
Note: You can remove any button already created by clicking its name in
the Nav Bar Elements field and clicking the Remove Item (–) button. You
can also reorder the sequence of the buttons as they will appear on the
page by clicking a button name in the Nav Bar Elements field and click-
ing the up or down arrow button.
8. In the Options area, select the Preload Images check box if you want the
rollover effects to appear without delay when the user triggers them.
9. To set the current button to appear in the Down state when the user
first sees the navigation bar (which you might do to indicate the cur-
rent page is the one represented by the button), select the Show
“Down Image” Initially check box in the Options area.
The Over While Down state works in combination with this option.
10. Select Horizontally or Vertically from the Insert drop-down list to
position the navigation bar horizontally or vertically.
11. To set up the button images in a table format, select the Use Tables
check box.
This option is checked by default.
12. Click OK to accept your choices and close the dialog box.

Adding Audio and Video to Your Pages
146
To check the navigation bar, you must preview your page in a browser.
Choose File➪Preview in Browser or click the Preview in Browser button and
use your mouse to point to the buttons.
To change elements of an existing navigation bar, choose Modify➪Navigation
Bar. The Modify Navigation Bar dialog box is nearly identical to the Insert
Navigation Bar dialog box shown in Figure 7-5, except that you can no longer
change the orientation of the bar or access the Use Tables check box.
Adding Audio and Video to Your Pages
You have two basic options, which are described in detail in the following
sections, for adding downloadable audio and video to your Web pages:
✦Embedding: You can embed an audio or video file to display a playback
console on a Web page that users can use to play, rewind, and fast-
forward the media file. (You can also embed an audio file and make it
invisible to create a background audio effect.)
Users must have an appropriate plug-in installed on their machines to
play the embedded audio or video file. To ensure maximum compatibility,
you may wish to use SWFs to present audio and video.
✦Linking: You can link to an audio or video file to give users the choice of
whether or not to view that media file.
Keep in mind that most audio and video files are large — large enough that
many folks impatiently click the Stop button on their browsers before a Web
page chock-full of audio or video effects has a chance to finish loading. Keep
the following basic rules in mind to help you use audio and video effectively
in your Web pages:
✦Use audio and video only when plain text just won’t do.
✦Keep your audio and video clips as short (and corresponding file sizes
as small) as possible.
Embedding an audio or video clip
You can embed an audio or video file by following these steps:
1. In the Document window, click the location in your page where you
want to add an embedded audio or video file.

2. Click and hold the Media button in the Media category of the Insert bar
and select Plugin from the pop-up menu, or choose Insert➪Media➪
Plugin.
The Select File dialog box, shown in Figure 7-6, appears.
3. In the File Name field in the Select File dialog box, enter the path or
browse to the audio or video file that you want to embed and click OK.
If the file is outside your current root directory, Dreamweaver asks
whether you want to copy the file to your site’s root directory. Click Yes.
4. In the Plugin Property inspector, size the Plugin placeholder to any
dimensions you prefer.
You can either enter a width and height in the W and H text fields in the
Plugin Property inspector, or you can drag a handle on the placeholder
to manually resize.
Test in all your target browsers (the browsers your users are likely to
view your site with) to ensure that users can view all the audio playback
controls or video area and controls.
You can click the Play button in the Plugin Property inspector to play your
media file without previewing your page in a browser.
Embedding background music
Embedding background music (music that plays automatically after the user
opens a page) in your page can be controversial because users may be
Figure 7-6:
Select a
media file
to import.

Adding Audio and Video to Your Pages
148
unpleasantly surprised by audio when they are expecting silence, and
because users have no way to turn off the music from within the browser. If
you still want to embed background music in your page, follow these steps:
1. In the Document window, click the location in your page where you
want to add an embedded audio file.
This should be an out-of-the-way location, like the bottom of your page,
so the embedded audio doesn’t create an awkward space in your design.
2. Click and hold the Media button in the Media category of the Insert
bar and select Plugin from the pop-up menu, or choose Insert➪
Media➪Plugin.
The Select File dialog box appears.
3. In the File Name field in the Select File dialog box, enter the path to
the audio file that you want to embed and click OK.
If the file is outside your current root directory, Dreamweaver asks
whether you want to copy the file to your site root. Click Yes.
4. Enter a width and height of 2 in the W and H text fields in the Plugin
Property inspector.
5. Click the Parameters button to open the Parameters dialog box.
6. In the Parameters dialog box, click the Add (+) button to add a new
parameter.
7. Click in the Parameter column and type hidden.
8. Type true in the Value column.
Steps 7 and 8 hide the audio playback controls.
9. Click OK to complete the process and close the dialog box.
Linking to an audio or video clip
A simple and relatively trouble-free way to include audio and video clips on
a Web page is to link the page to an audio or video file. Users can click the
link if they want to hear or watch the clip. This selection opens a player out-
side the browser where the user can control playback.
You follow the same steps to create a link to an audio or video file that
resides in your root folder as you do to create a link to a Web page (see
Book II, Chapter 2); the only difference is that you specify a media file
instead of a URL for the link.

Adding Other Media
149
Adding Other Media
Dreamweaver enables you to easily insert a number of other multimedia for-
mats into your Web pages, including ActiveX, Java Applets, Macromedia
Flash, and Shockwave. After inserting any of these media formats, you can
set the control and playback features of the media in the Parameters dialog
box. Additionally, you can fine-tune the media action on your page by using
the Behaviors panel to create triggering actions that cause the media to
play, stop, and execute other functions.
Follow these directions to insert other media:
1. In the Document window, click the location in your page where you
want to add a multimedia file.
2. Click and hold the Media button in the Common category of the
Insert bar to view all the object types that you can insert, as shown
in Figure 7-7, and select the icon of the type of media file you want
to insert.
Alternatively, you can choose Insert➪Media➪Media Type, where Media
Type is the type of media file you want to insert.

The Select File dialog box appears.
• For Applet, Macromedia Flash, and Shockwave files: In the File
Name field in the Select File dialog box, enter the path to the media
and click OK. Your file is inserted, and the associated Property
inspector appears. You can change the selected file in the Plugin
Property inspector by typing a new name in the File text field or by
browsing in the File folder to select a file (for Applets, use the Code
text field). Select the Embed check box if you want Netscape
Navigator users to have access to the Applet.
• For ActiveX: An ActiveX placeholder is inserted, and the ActiveX
Property inspector appears. Enter the name of the ActiveX object
you want to play in the Class ID text field. Select the Embed check
box if you want Netscape Navigator users to have access to the
ActiveX object.
3. In the Property inspector for your selected media, enter dimensions
in the W and H text fields to size the Media placeholder to any dimen-
sions you choose.
4. In the Property inspector for your selected media, click the
Parameters button to open the Parameters dialog box, where you can
add parameters (like width, height, loop, and autoplay) appropriate
to the selected media type.
Using Dreamweaver MX 2004 Templates
Dreamweaver comes with many built-in layouts that you can use to create
pages or Dreamweaver templates quickly. The layouts are predesigned pages
with placeholder content. Make a new page from a layout, replace the place-
holder content with real content, and voilà — a professionally designed page!
To create a new page based on a built-in layout, just follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪New.
The New Document dialog box appears.
2. Select Table Based Layouts in the Category list on the left.
The Table Based Layouts appear in the middle column. Click any one to
see a preview in the Preview area, as shown in Figure 7-8.
3. When you’ve found the layout you want, select the Document option
in the lower-right corner and click the Create button.
An untitled HTML page opens in the Document window, with place-
holder content that you can replace with real content.

If you wanted to create your own template based on the built-in layout,
you could select the Template option in the lower-right corner of the
New Document dialog box.
You don’t have to use a built-in layout to create a Dreamweaver template:
You can make a Dreamweaver template based on any Web page. One cool
thing about Dreamweaver templates is that if you make a whole bunch of
pages based on a template, you can change the template and all the pages
based on it will be updated to match the template automatically. Another
cool thing is that you can make a template that other people can use in com-
bination with either Dreamweaver or Contribute 2 to create new pages that
conform to the template’s design.
To create a Dreamweaver template based on an existing HTML page, just
follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪New.
The New Document dialog box appears, with the General tab selected.
2. Select Basic Page from the Category list on the left, and then select
HTML Template from the list of Basic Pages that appear in the middle.
You can also select Template Page from the Category list and choose
HTML Template from the Template Page list that appears in the middle.
3. Create your page layout.
By default, nothing in the design of pages based on your template is
editable. You must create editable regions in order to make a useful 
template.

4. Click a table cell or other part of your layout that you want users to
be able to fill with content and select Insert➪Template Objects➪
Editable Region, or use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Alt+V.
The New Editable Region dialog box appears. If you have a placeholder
image already in the layout, you can right-click the image and choose
Templates➪New Editable Region from the contextual menu that pops up,
or you can select the image and use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Alt+V.
5. Name the region and click OK.
You can use the default name Dreamweaver gives to the region, but it’s
better if you name the region to reflect the content that will go into it
(for example, name the region Product Description). Figure 7-9 shows a
template with three editable regions. Editable regions are bound by a
light blue box with region name at the top left.
6. Repeat Steps 4 and 5 until you have made editable regions out of all
the areas of the page that you want to be editable in new pages based
on the template.
Anything inside an editable region can be replaced in a page based on
the template; anything outside the editable regions is locked and can’t
be changed in pages based on the template.
7. Choose File➪Save.
The Save As Template dialog box appears.
8. Choose the site the template belongs to from the drop-down list, enter
a name for the template in the Save As field, and click the Save button.
The template will now be available to anyone who has access to the
Dreamweaver site, either through Dreamweaver or with Contribute.

You may turn any existing page into a template. Choose File➪Save as
Template when the page is open. If you try to close the template without
having created editable regions (as described in the previous steps),
Dreamweaver gives you a warning message saying that the template does
not contain any editable regions. Click OK to close the warning dialog box,
create the editable regions in your template, and choose File➪Save to save
your template.
To create an HTML page based on an existing user-created template, follow
these steps:
1. Click the Templates icon in the Assets tab of the File panel. All avail-
able templates for the selected site appear.
If the Files panel is closed, select Window➪Assets or use the keyboard
shortcut F11.
2. Right-click the template you want to create the new page from and
choose New from Template, as shown in Figure 7-10.
The page opens as an HTML page in the Document window.

the New Document dialog box. (When you select the Templates tab, the
dialog box’s title bar changes to read New from Template and the Templates
options appear, as shown in Figure 7-11.)
Validating Your Code
Dreamweaver MX 2004 has a built-in code validator. The validator checks
your HTML for errors (for example, unclosed <TD> tags, or tags with invalid
attributes, such as <FONT width=113>). If you work exclusively in Design
view, you may never need to use the validator. If you work in Code view,
though, and you are creating long, complex pages, you may find it worth-
while to run the validator.
To validate your code (unless it’s XML), select File➪Check Page➪Validate
Markup. The Results panel opens and shows a list of warnings for any faults
in the code.
To validate XML code, select File➪Check Page➪Validate as XML. Because
XML has stricter requirements for well-formed code, you should take advan-
tage of Dreamweaver’s built-in validator if you’re writing XML.

ith the release of the Macromedia Studio MX 2004 suite,
Macromedia brought Fireworks MX 2004, Macromedia Flash MX
2004, Dreamweaver MX 2004, ColdFusion MX 6.1 Developer Edition, and
FreeHand MX closer together than ever before. Macromedia Studio MX 2004
also adds Contribute 2 to the mix. The applications in the suite have 
complementary — and in some cases overlapping — capabilities.
In order to take advantage of Dreamweaver’s integration with Fireworks and
Macromedia Flash, you need to make sure Design Notes are enabled. Design
Notes are Macromedia Studio’s way of tracking changes and establishing
links between exported files (such as GIFs or JPEGs) and their source files
(Fireworks PNG files, for example).
By default, Design Notes are enabled when you establish a new site. If you
disabled them and wish to re-enable them, just follow these steps:
1. In Dreamweaver, choose Site➪Manage Sites.
The Manage Sites dialog box appears.
2. Select the site by clicking it.
If you have a site open already, that site is already selected.
3. Click the Edit button.
The Site Definition dialog box opens.

4. If the Site Definition dialog box opens with the Basic tab selected,
click the Advanced tab.
The Advanced options appear.
5. Select Design Notes in the Category list.
The Design Notes options appear.
6. Select the Maintain Design Notes check box, as shown in Figure 8-1.
The Maintain Design Notes option is selected by default, but it can be
toggled on and off in the Site Definition dialog box.
7. If you’re working on the site with others, make sure the Upload
Design Notes for Sharing check box is selected.
The Upload Design Notes for Sharing option uploads your Design Notes
so that other people working on the site can have access to them. If
you’re the only person working on a site, you should deselect this
option to speed file transfers.
8. Click OK.
Disabling Design Notes is simple: Just follow the preceding steps, but in 
Step 6, deselect the Maintain Design Notes check box.

With Design Notes enabled, you can move seamlessly back and forth between
Dreamweaver and the other applications in the Macromedia Studio suite.
Integrating Dreamweaver with Fireworks
Fireworks is a Web design tool and Dreamweaver is an HTML editor, so you
may expect that the two applications complement each other well. In fact,
the two programs make a dynamite tag team.
The phrase Roundtrip HTML refers to the basic interaction between Fireworks
and Dreamweaver. Essentially, if you generate your HTML in Fireworks and
edit the code in Dreamweaver, Fireworks recognizes the changes you make in
Dreamweaver. That goes for links, image maps, behaviors shared by both pro-
grams, and edited HTML text. If you make radical changes to the overall
design of the page in Dreamweaver, however, Fireworks may not be able to
reconcile the HTML with the Fireworks PNG source file. In those cases,
Fireworks will write over your changed code with new code.
In order to take advantage of Roundtrip HMTL, you need to establish a few
settings, both in Dreamweaver and in Fireworks. In Dreamweaver, you need
to define a local site (see Book II, Chapter 3) and make Fireworks your pri-
mary image-editing application. To find out how, read the next section.
Making Fireworks your primary image editor
If you installed Dreamweaver along with the rest of Macromedia Studio,
Fireworks is your primary image-editing application by default. However, if
you changed that default setting, here’s how to return to the setting of
Fireworks as your primary image-editing application:
1. In Dreamweaver, choose Edit➪Preferences or use the keyboard
shortcut Ctrl+U.
The Preferences dialog box appears.
2. Select File Types / Editors in the Category list.
The File Types / Editors options appear in the Preferences dialog box, as
shown in Figure 8-2.
3. Select the .png extension in the Extensions list.
The extension is highlighted.
4. Click the plus (+) button over the Editors list.
If Fireworks is already listed in the Editors list, you don’t need to click
the plus (+) button.
Integrating
Dreamweaver
MX 2004

5. If you need to add Fireworks to the Editors list, navigate to
Fireworks.exe on your hard drive and double-click it.
If Fireworks is now the only application listed in the Editors area, it’s the
primary editor by default (Primary is in parentheses next to Fireworks).
6. If you have more than one image editor in the Editors list, select
Fireworks in the list and click the Make Primary button.
7. Repeat Steps 3 through 6 for the .gif, .jpg, .jpe, and .jpeg
extensions.
8. Click OK.
You may need to set a few preferences in Fireworks as well. See Book III,
Chapter 8 for information on how to set Launch and Edit preferences in
Fireworks.
Working with tables
Taking advantage of Roundtrip HTML means more than just setting 
preferences: You also need to know which application is best to use for 
particular types of changes. If you originally exported your HTML from
Fireworks and wish to make major structural changes to the table that 
constitutes your HTML page, we recommend that you modify your original
Fireworks PNG source file and re-export the HTML from there, rather than
using Dreamweaver to modify the code. Using Fireworks to change the table 
structure ensures that the slices in your Fireworks PNG source file will cor-
respond to the cells in your HTML table.
Here’s how to edit a table in Fireworks (provided the table was created when
you exported your page design as HTML from Fireworks) by launching it
from within Dreamweaver:
Figure 8-2:
The Dream-
weaver
Preferences
dialog box.

Book II
Chapter 8
Integrating Dreamweaver with Fireworks
159
1. Select the table in Dreamweaver.
The Property inspector updates to display the parameters of the table.
2. Click the Fireworks Edit button in the Property inspector.
If need be, you can navigate to the source Fireworks PNG file from within
the Dreamweaver Property inspector. The source file opens in Fireworks.
3. Make edits to the slices or guides as necessary.
4. Click the Done button when you’re finished editing.
The Fireworks window closes, and Dreamweaver updates the table and
images.
When you launch and edit a table in Fireworks, it may overwrite some
changes you may have made to the table structure in your Dreamweaver
code, if the changes you made in Dreamweaver are substantial. A warning
notifies you when Fireworks will overwrite the existing Dreamweaver edits.
When you want to leave the table structure intact but need to rename or
reoptimize an image, you can launch Fireworks from a selected image rather
than a selected table. Editing a JPEG image from its Fireworks PNG source
file rather than editing and resaving the already optimized image ensures
the highest image quality.
To launch and edit a PNG source file from an optimized image placed in
Dreamweaver (to change graphic text in a JPEG image, for example), follow
these steps:
1. Click the optimized image in the Dreamweaver Document window.
The Property inspector updates to display image parameters.
2. Click the Fireworks Edit button in the Property inspector, as shown
in Figure 8-3, or right-click the optimized image and choose Edit with
Fireworks from the contextual menu that appears.
If Dreamweaver cannot locate the source Fireworks PNG file, you’re
prompted to navigate to the source file. When you do, the source PNG
file opens in Fireworks. At the top of the Fireworks canvas, the words
“Editing from Dreamweaver” show that Roundtrip HTML is in effect.
Notice at the top left of the Property inspector that the Fireworks icon
and the designation FW Image identify the selected image as one cre-
ated in Fireworks. Note also the Fireworks Src text field at the bottom
middle of the Property inspector, which shows the path and name of the
source Fireworks PNG file.
3. Edit the image within the context of your overall page design.
The new version of the image will be exported at the specified settings,
which you may leave as is or change before clicking Done.

Dreamweaver
MX 2004

4. Click the Done button at the top left of the canvas.
The Fireworks window minimizes. When you look at the Document
window in Dreamweaver, you see the new image.
You can also launch and edit a GIF or JPEG image directly in Fireworks,
though it’s always best to edit from the source PNG when possible, both to
preserve image quality and to keep your source file in sync with your Web
page. If you don’t have a source PNG (or don’t need to keep your source
design file up to date) and you just want to tweak an image without changing
its width and height, you can do so easily as follows:
1. Double-click the image’s filename or corresponding icon on the Files
tab or Assets tab of the Files panel.
Fireworks launches, and your image appears on the canvas.
2. Make changes to the image.
3. Export the updated GIF or JPEG from Fireworks by choosing File➪
Export or using the key command Ctrl+Shift+R.
If necessary, navigate to the folder in which you keep the optimized
images for your site. A prompt warns you that the file already exists.
Click OK to replace the existing file.
4. Close the file in Fireworks.
When you close the file in Fireworks, an alert asks if you want to save
changes to your file. If you want Fireworks to save the file as a PNG,
click Yes. Otherwise, click No.
You can add a Fireworks-generated table to an open Dreamweaver document,
whether the document is blank or has code already in it:
1. Choose Insert➪Image Objects➪Fireworks HTML.
The Insert Fireworks HTML dialog box appears.

2. Type the pathname or click the Browse button and browse to the
Fireworks HTML file.
If the HTML file you select was not generated by Fireworks, an alert
informs you, and you won’t be able to insert the HTML.
3. Select the Delete File after Insertion check box if you don’t need to
save the Fireworks-generated HTML.
Unless you want a backup copy of the HTML, free from any edits you
might make in Dreamweaver, you can safely delete it.
4. Click OK.
If you want to nest tables but still use Roundtrip HTML, one way to do it is
to make a large table in Dreamweaver and insert Fireworks-generated tables
in the cells. Then, if you need to change one of the inserted tables, you can
select the table and edit it in Fireworks.
Integrating Dreamweaver with Macromedia Flash
You can create Flash buttons and Flash text without actually having
Macromedia Flash installed on your computer, thanks to Dreamweaver’s
Flash commands. If you’ve installed Macromedia Studio, though, you’ll 
probably prefer to create Flash movies in Macromedia Flash and let
Dreamweaver write the code to embed Flash SWF files in your HTML pages.
Inserting a Flash movie into 
a Dreamweaver document
Inserting a Flash SWF movie into a Dreamweaver document is easy, and
Dreamweaver offers easy access to many parameters of SWF movies directly
from the Property inspector, though you can’t edit a Flash SWF movie from
within Dreamweaver.
To insert an SWF file into an existing Dreamweaver HTML document, follow
these steps:
1. Click the spot in the page where you want the Flash movie to go.
2. Choose Insert➪Media➪Flash (or use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Alt+F)
or click and hold the Media button in the Common category of the
Insert bar and choose the Flash icon.
The Select File dialog box appears.
Integrating
Dreamweaver
MX 2004

3. Navigate to the SWF file and double-click it, or click it once and
click OK.
You can type the name of the file in the File Name text field instead if
you prefer. The Select File dialog box closes and your SWF movie is
placed where the cursor was last active.
Working with the Property inspector
When an SWF file is selected in the Document window, the Dreamweaver
Property inspector (shown in Figure 8-4) gives you access to many parame-
ters for the display of the movie, including:
✦Width and Height: Unless specified otherwise here in the W and H
fields, the SWF will display at the dimensions you set in Macromedia
Flash’s Document Properties dialog box.
✦Loop: You can toggle looping on or off by selecting or deselecting this
check box.
✦Autoplay: You can toggle autoplay on or off by selecting or deselecting
this check box. When Autoplay is selected, the SWF starts automatically
when the HTML page loads in the user’s browser window.
✦V Space and H Space: As with GIFs and JPEGs, you can set the vertical
and horizontal spacing to provide margins between SWFs and other
content that occupies the same table cell.
✦Quality: This drop-down list offers four options: High, Auto High, Auto
Low, and Low. The Low option sacrifices image quality to increase
smoothness in the flow of the animation.
✦Scale: This drop-down list gives you three choices: Show All, No Border,
and Exact Fit.
✦Align: This drop-down list offers access to all the options for aligning
the SWF within a table cell.

✦Background color (Bg): A background color chosen here overrides the
background color as set in Macromedia Flash’s Document Properties
dialog box.
The Property inspector also includes some other handy tools:
✦The Flash Edit button: This button opens the source FLA file in the
Macromedia Flash application.
✦The Reset Size button: This button restores the SWF to its original
dimensions.
✦The Play button: This button allows you to see the SWF file in action
without opening the page in a browser window.
✦The Parameters button: This button allows you to customize param-
eters passed to the SWF.
The Flash Edit button in the Property inspector is grayed out if you do not
have Macromedia Flash installed on your computer. When you want to edit
an SWF, you need to go back to the FLA source file to make your changes,
and then re-export the SWF. This is true except in the case of changing a link
in an SWF file, in which case Dreamweaver adds a Design Note to pass the
new link to the FLA source movie when you next launch and edit the FLA.
Editing a Flash movie in Dreamweaver
To edit a Flash movie from within Dreamweaver, just follow these steps:
1. Select the SWF file by clicking it in the Dreamweaver Document
window.
The Property inspector updates to display the Macromedia Flash
parameters. (Refer to Figure 8-4.)
2. Click the Edit button in the Property inspector.
If necessary, navigate to the FLA source file in the Locate Macromedia
Flash Document File dialog box and double-click the FLA, or click it once
and then click the Open button.
The source file opens in Macromedia Flash. The designation “Editing
from Dreamweaver” confirms that Macromedia Flash was launched from
within Dreamweaver.
3. Edit the Flash movie source file.
4. Click the Done button at the top left of the Flash stage.
Macromedia Flash exports an updated SWF to the proper directory, saves
the FLA file to its current directory, and closes. The new SWF appears in
the Dreamweaver Document window. If you changed the dimensions of the
Flash movie, click the Reset size button to update the Dreamweaver code.

Editing a link in an SWF file in Dreamweaver
Editing a link in an SWF file is similar to editing a Flash movie, but you need
to set up a few things beforehand:
✦Establish a home page and dependent pages in the Site Map.
✦Set the Site Map to display dependent files (as in Figure 8-5).
See the Dreamweaver Help files for details on setting up a Site Map.
After you’ve done that, you can change a link in an SWF by following these
steps:
1. Right-click the link displayed under the SWF in the Site Map and
choose Change Link from the contextual menu.
The Select HTML File dialog box appears.
2. Navigate to the file to which you want to link and double-click it, or
type a URL into the URL text field.
3. Click OK.
You can also update a link in an SWF while updating the same link in other
files by choosing Site➪Change Link Sitewide and inputting the old and new
links in the Change Link Sitewide dialog box that appears. Whether you
change the link only in the SWF file or in an SWF file as part of a sitewide
update, the FLA source file will not be updated until you launch and edit the
SWF from Dreamweaver.

Integrating Dreamweaver with ColdFusion
Dreamweaver fully absorbed ColdFusion, in the sense that Dreamweaver
became the working environment for ColdFusion. In Book VI, we describe
how to set up your ColdFusion server, as well as concepts in programming;
Book II, Chapter 6 offers the information you need to write CFML
(ColdFusion Markup Language) using Dreamweaver.
Integrating Dreamweaver with FreeHand
Though you can publish FreeHand documents as HTML (complete with
embedded SWF movies, URL links, and Flash actions), FreeHand MX is not
as tightly integrated with Dreamweaver as Fireworks is.
FreeHand is primarily a print-oriented design application, so it’s no surprise
that it lacks the kinds of controls Fireworks offers for image slicing and 
optimization.
In other words, if you’re designing for the Web, you’ll find Fireworks a much
better tool (not in the least for its solid integration with Dreamweaver).
Nonetheless, if you ever find yourself with an HTML file published by
FreeHand, rest assured that you can open and edit that file in Dreamweaver,
as you can with an HTML file created in any application.
Integrating Dreamweaver with Contribute
From the beginning, Contribute was built with Dreamweaver in mind. Now
with the release of version 2.0, Contribute has become more integrated with
the Macromedia Studio suite, and Dreamweaver in particular, than ever.
See the section on enabling Contribute compatibility in Book II, Chapter 3
for a quick discussion of what to do if you haven’t yet built your site and
want others to maintain it using Contribute.
If you’ve built a site already and want to be able to administer it without
leaving Dreamweaver, just follow these steps:
1. Choose Site➪Manage Sites.
The Manage Sites dialog box appears.
2. Select the site you want to administer and click Edit.
The Site Definition dialog box appears.

4. Click Contribute in the Category list.
The Contribute options load in the main part of the dialog box.
5. Select the Enable Contribute Compatibility check box if it’s not
already selected.
If you haven’t enabled Design Notes and Check In/Out, a dialog box
appears to alert you to that fact. Click OK to enable them. The
Contribute Site Settings dialog box appears.
6. Enter your name and e-mail address in the Site Settings dialog box
and click OK.
The dialog box closes, and new options appear in the Contribute page
of the Site Definition window.
7. Enter the remote site root URL (for example, http://www.
loungeboy.com) in the Site Root URL text field, if it’s not already
there, and click the Test button.
Dreamweaver confirms the URL is accurate by connecting to the site.
8. Click the Administer Site in Contribute button.
Either the Administrator Password dialog box appears, or, if there’s no
administrator for the site yet, a Contribute dialog box appears that asks
if you want to be the administrator for the site.
9a. If the Administrator Password dialog box appears, enter the password
and click OK.
9b. If the Contribute dialog box appears, asking if you want to be the
administrator (and you do want to be the administrator), click Yes.
The Administrator Password dialog box appears. Enter a password in
the New Password text field, and re-enter it in the Confirm New
Password text field below. Then click OK. Note that passwords are case-
sensitive. (If the Contribute dialog box appears and you don’t want to
be the administrator, click No.)
Contribute opens in the background, and the Administer Website dialog
box appears, as shown in Figure 8-6.
10. Make any changes to the Administer Website settings and click OK.
The Administer Website dialog box closes, and Contribute closes. For
information on the Administer Website options, see Book VII, Chapter 3.
11. Click OK in the Site Definition dialog box.
12. Click Done in the Manage Sites dialog box.

F
ireworks MX 2004 is the latest version of a graphics creation and edit-
ing program designed to streamline the process of making images for
the Web. In the days before the original version of Fireworks, making graph-
ics for the Web could be a frustrating and time-consuming process of trial
and error. Not only that, but the results often looked pretty bad.
With products like Fireworks, all that has changed. This chapter gives you a
brief introduction and tour of the product and shows you how to set up
Fireworks to fit your working style.
Understanding the Power of Fireworks
The basic process of making graphics for a Web site can be divided into two
major parts:
✦Creating the images: This consists of drawing, importing, and manipu-
lating pictures, as well as designing the overall page layout on the
Fireworks canvas.
✦Optimizing the images: This includes slicing the page layout into
pieces, selecting the proper compression format and level for each
piece, and exporting the individual pieces.
Fireworks has two different tools that make the process of creating graphics
for a Web site easier: layers and slices. Layers are a mainstay of graphics
development tools, such as Photoshop and FreeHand, and animation pro-
grams, such as Macromedia Flash. Layers make creating and editing graph-
ics a simpler proposition. Slices, first introduced by Macromedia in the
original version of Fireworks, offer an efficient way to divide a design into
individually optimized Web graphics. Both layers and slices are described
in more detail in the following sections.

Understanding the Power of Fireworks
172
Making designing easier with layers
We discuss layers in more detail in Book III, Chapter 5, but this section
serves as an introduction to the benefits of layers.
Layers act like transparent sheets that can be stacked one on top of the
other. You draw a separate element of the image on each transparency.
Any area where you haven’t put something remains transparent, so layers
beneath show through. In a typical file you might have several text layers
and many layers of backgrounds, icons, lines, shapes, and so on.
If you ever make mistakes or change your mind about things, layers can save
you lots of time as you design your site. Suppose that you’re doing calligra-
phy and illustration on fine paper. If you mess up one part of the image, the
whole thing is often ruined because you only have one layer to work with:
the paper. Short of cutting a piece out of the paper, you may not be able to
delete your mistakes. Layers offer a practical approach to fixing your errors.
Using layers provides many benefits. Some of the most practical advantages
include the following:
✦You can change any element of your design — text, bitmap, or vector
shape — without altering or destroying any other element.
✦You can apply effects to layers that are grouped together, decreasing
the amount of time it takes to edit an image. (Of course, you can also
apply effects to individual layers.)
✦You can easily move elements up and down in the stack of layers to
change the visual effect on the screen.
✦You can test new designs and effects in a snap because hiding and
showing elements of an image is extremely easy.
Creating slices
We discuss slices in more detail in Book III, Chapter 6, but here’s an intro-
duction to the concept of slices. Imagine for a moment that you’ve created
your masterpiece design for a new Web site. Your Fireworks file may include
lots of different kinds of imagery, including the following:
✦Logos
✦Navigation buttons
✦Header graphics, such as banners
✦Photos
✦Drawings
✦Animations

Book III
Chapter 1
Introduction to
Fireworks MX 2004
Understanding the Power of Fireworks
173
Before you can create your Web page, you’ve got to get all of these graphics
into a Web-friendly format, which is where slices come in. The idea is simple,
yet elegant: include a special layer in the program that can never be removed,
where you can create guides as to how you want the images to be “sliced” up
into separate, individually optimized, and hyperlinked images. Figure 1-1
shows that special layer, called the Web layer, and some slices in action.
Slices provide some key advantages over traditional methods of creating
images for the Web:
✦You can slice a design into more than one image at a time.
✦You can export multiple files in a single procedure.
✦You can control exactly where images are sliced, which helps prevent
you from making images with overlapping areas.
✦You have an increased ability to optimize image size (and thereby
reduce download time) by selecting the best optimization method for
each slice.
Slices guarantee that the layout of your Web page appears nearly identical
on every user’s screen to the design you create in Fireworks. (If you have
HTML text on your page, the appearance of that text may vary, depending
on which browser and platform the user views your page with.)

The Fireworks interface is set up to make accessing the tools quick and intu-
itive. When you start Fireworks, you’ll notice that it doesn’t create a new
document automatically — instead, you see something new with Fireworks
MX 2004: the Start Page, as shown in Figure 1-2. From the Start Page, you get
one-click access to:
✦Open a Recent Item: Just click the filename, or click the Open folder
and browse to a file to open the image in Fireworks.
✦Create New: Click the Fireworks File link to open a new, blank image.
✦Extend: Click the Fireworks Exchange link to browse to a part of the
Macromedia Web site that includes lots of free, downloadable cool tools
and graphical elements created by users like you.
✦Tutorials: Click the Take a Quick Tour of Fireworks link or the Take a
Fireworks Tutorial link to go through a tutorial.

If you don’t want the Start Page to show up every time you launch Fireworks,
click the Don’t Show Again check box at the bottom-left corner of the page.
To create a new Fireworks file (called a PNG file), just follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪New, or click the Fireworks File link on the Start Page.
The New Document dialog box appears.
2. Choose the canvas size for your document.
The default width and height are 500 pixels, and the default resolution is
72 pixels per inch. You can enter your own size in the fields provided
and change the unit of measurement by selecting one from the drop-
down list. You should leave the resolution at 72 pixels per inch unless
you’re designing for some medium other than the Web, like print.
3. Select a color for the canvas.
The default canvas color is white, but you can choose a custom color by
selecting the Custom radio button and then using the eyedropper to
choose a color from the color picker. You can also choose to have a
transparent background by selecting the Transparent radio button.
4. Click OK to create your new Fireworks document.
When you click OK, you see something that looks a lot like Figure 1-3.
The Tools panel: A bird’s-eye view
The panels lined along the left side of the screen are parts of the Tools
panel, which provides access to all the tools you use to make and modify
your graphics. The Tools panel divides tools into groups based on their
function, as described in the following list:
✦Select: Contains tools used to select an object, as well as tools used to
crop or otherwise manipulate the canvas.
✦Bitmap: Stores tools used to paint, draw, fill, and so on.
✦Vector: Contains tools used to create and manipulate vector graphics.
(See Book V, Chapter 1 for more on vector graphics.)
✦Web: Holds tools, such as the Slice tool, that are designed specifically
for getting images ready for the Web.
✦Colors: Stows away tools that control the color(s) of objects.
✦View: Holds tools that you can use to change your view of the canvas or
the screen.

An arrow at the lower-right corner of a tool’s icon indicates that the tool has
one or more specialized variations. You can click the arrow to activate a
pop-up menu that displays icons for the available variations.
The Tools panel: A bug’s-eye view
This section gives you the lowdown on the tools you’ll likely use the most in
the Tools panel. An arrow at the bottom right of the tool icon indicates there
are related tools available. Click the icon or the arrow to activate a pop-up
menu so that you can choose from all the available tools. When a tool is
selected, you can also cycle through the related tools by pressing certain
keys on your keyboard (for example, select the Marquee tool and press M to
toggle through the Marquee tools). The Tooltip for each tool includes the
key you can press to cycle through the options on the tool.
You get to see the tools in action in subsequent chapters, but for now, here
are the highlights for each of the three key categories of tools:
✦Select: The following four tools (clockwise from top left) make up the
Select section of the Tools panel:
• Pointer/Select Behind tool: Use the Pointer tool to select objects on
the canvas by clicking on them or clicking and dragging an area that

encompasses them. Use the new Select Behind tool when you want
to click an object on the canvas that is covered by other objects.
• Subselection tool: Use the Subselection tool to select an individual
object from a group.
• Crop/Export Area tool: Click the Crop tool and click-and-drag to
select an area on the canvas to crop an image. When you crop an
image, you discard everything outside the selected area from your
image. After you have selected the area that you want to keep,
double-click inside the area to crop. Use the Export Area tool to
create a new image from the area you select. After you have selected
the area you want to export, double-click inside the area to bring up
the Export Preview window.
• Scale/Skew/Distort tool: This tool is inactive (as indicated by the
dimmed icon) until you have selected an object on the canvas. Click
this tool and click and drag the transform handles at the corners of
the object to change its size and/or shape.
✦Bitmap: The following ten tools (clockwise from top left) make up the
Bitmap section of the Tools panel:
• Marquee/Oval Marquee tool: Click the Marquee tool and click and
drag to select a rectangular area on the canvas. If you want to select
a circle or oval area, use the Oval Marquee variation. When you
select an area, you select all objects that fall completely within 
the area.
• Lasso/Polygon Lasso tool: Click the Lasso tool and click and drag on
the canvas to select everything within an irregularly shaped area of
the canvas. If the shape you want to select is made up of straight
lines, use the Polygon Lasso.
• Brush tool: Click this tool to paint on the canvas. See Book III,
Chapter 3 for more information about the very versatile Brush tool.
• Eraser tool: Click the Eraser tool to erase a swath through any
bitmap object on the canvas.
• Rubber Stamp/Replace Color/Red Eye Removal tool: Click this tool
to copy a selected area of a bitmap to another spot on the canvas.
Alt+click the area that you want to copy, and then click and paint
where you want the copy to go. Use the new Replace Color tool to
swap one color for another wherever you click and drag the Replace
Color brush on the canvas. Simply click with the new Red Eye Removal
tool to replace red with black wherever you click the canvas.
• Paint Bucket/Gradient tool: Click this tool and then click a shape
on the canvas to fill the shape with a solid color (Paint Bucket) or
gradient. For details about gradients, see Book III, Chapter 4.

• Eyedropper tool: Click this handy tool to select a color from the
swatches in the color picker or from any object on the canvas by
clicking the desired color.
• Blur/Sharpen/Dodge/Burn/Smudge tool: Click this tool and click
and drag on the canvas to soften the focus of (Blur) or bring into
focus (Sharpen) an area of a bitmap image. Click the Dodge tool and
click and drag on the canvas to lighten an area of a bitmap image.
Click the Burn tool and click and drag to darken an area of a bitmap
image. Click the Smudge tool and click and drag on the canvas to
smear a part of an image into another part of the image, as if you
were finger painting. You can set the parameters for these tools in
the Property inspector.
• Pencil tool: Click the Pencil tool and click and drag to draw single-
pixel-width lines. If you want control over the thickness and texture
of the line you are creating, use the Brush tool.
• Magic Wand tool: Click the Magic Wand and click a bitmap to select
contiguous areas of solid or similar colors in your image.
✦Vector: The following six tools (clockwise from top left) make up the
Vector section of the Tools panel:
• Line tool: Throw your ruler away! With the Line tool, you can draw a
straight line every time. You can adjust the line’s thickness, color,
and other parameters in the Property inspector.
• Pen/Vector Path/Redraw Path tool: Click the Pen tool to create
vector graphics by drawing vector paths. You can use the Pen tool
to select points and let Fireworks connect the dots, or you can draw
the shape yourself with the Vector Path tool. You can use the Redraw
Path tool to change the shape of a vector graphic by clicking and
dragging any of the points that define the shape.
• Text tool: Click this tool and click the canvas to place and edit text
on the canvas. See Book III, Chapter 3 for information on how to
make the most of the Text tool.
• Knife tool: Click this tool and click and drag a line to cut vector
paths in two.
• Freeform/Reshape Area/Path Scrubber (Additive)/Path Scrubber
(Subtractive) tool: Use the Freeform tool to reshape a vector path by
pushing or pulling the stroke instead of moving the individual points
that define it. Use the Reshape Area tool to pull a vector path as if you
had grabbed it with your hand. Use the Path Scrubber tool to change
the color, thickness, and various other properties of the vector path. If
you have a graphics tablet, you can set the properties to vary based
on variations in the pressure or speed you use in drawing.
• Rectangle/Rounded Rectangle/Ellipse/Polygon tool: Create vector
shapes by clicking these tools and clicking and dragging on the canvas.

Across the aisle: The right-side panels
Four key panels appear on the right-hand side of the screen, opposite the
Tools panel. These panels include the following:
✦The Optimize panel: This panel enables you to set your export options
(GIF or JPEG, quality level, and so on). See Book III, Chapter 6 for more
information about the Optimize panel.
✦The Layers panel: This panel contains all your layer options and infor-
mation. The first layer is always the Web layer, which holds information
about the coordinates of the slices. (See Book III, Chapter 6 for more
about slices.)
✦The Assets panel: This panel provides a way to centralize and organize
links from Web objects to Web pages. Fireworks can actually generate
your entire Web page — images, code, and all.
✦The Frames and History panel: This panel gives you access to the
Frames area, where you can navigate easily among the frames in your
document. You use frames to make button rollovers and animations.
(See Book III, Chapter 5 for more details.) This panel also allows you to
view the History area, which is a list of your most recent actions.
The Property inspector
The Property inspector is docked to the bottom of the Document window.
This panel changes automatically to reflect the settings for the currently
selected tool or object.
The Property inspector allows you to see and adjust the parameters of
whatever object or tool you select. If you’re working on a text layer, for
example, the Property inspector gives you immediate access to and com-
plete control over the font, size, color, and other attributes of the text. 
When you select a shape, on the other hand, the Property inspector offers
you easy access to controls over the shape’s size, position on the canvas,
color, texture, and more.
If you ever want to hide all the panels temporarily, press F4 or the Tab key.
To make the panels visible, press F4 or the Tab key again.
Viewing and Previewing Your Work
While you work, you view the canvas with Original view selected. The other
three view options at the top of the canvas allow you to preview what your
optimized images will look like as follows:

Customizing Your Work Environment
180
✦Original: This is the default view in which you create and edit your design.
✦Preview: This view shows you what the page will look like when it is opti-
mized for the Web, based on your current image optimization settings.
✦2-Up: This view offers previews of what optimized images will look like,
but with a little something extra: a side-by-side comparison of the origi-
nal image and an optimized version of the image, or two optimization
settings.
✦4-Up: By selecting the 4-Up view, you can preview the original image and
three different optimization settings at the same time. You can compare
how they look and how big the resulting image file would be at each set-
ting, as well as how long the image would take to download at a particu-
lar modem speed.
Because every image compresses a little differently, you can never predict
exactly what an image might look like after it is optimized. The longer you
work with Fireworks, the better you get at narrowing the optimization
options before you preview; nevertheless, you may find it more efficient to
preview before you export. For more information about the purpose and art
of image optimization, see Book III, Chapter 6.
At the top right of the canvas is a feature introduced in the original
Fireworks: a Quick Export button. The Quick Export button allows you to
export files to, and even launch, other applications, such as Dreamweaver
MX 2004, Macromedia Flash MX 2004, and FreeHand MX. Export options for
Macromedia Director Shockwave Studio, Adobe Photoshop, and other pro-
grams are also available from the Quick Export button.
Customizing Your Work Environment
During different phases of the design process, you may find that you refer to
some panels constantly but other panels not at all. Unless you have a gigantic
monitor set to a high resolution, you’ll need to collapse some less-frequently
used panels to make room for more-frequently used ones.
Collapsing and expanding panels
Every panel’s name is displayed at the left on the top title bar in the panel.
To the left of the name sits a handy little arrow that points down to indicate
the panel is expanded and points to the panel name if the panel is collapsed.
You can expand or collapse a panel in two ways:
✦Click the name of the panel.
✦Click the arrow to the left of the panel name.

Book III
Chapter 1
Introduction to
Fireworks MX 2004
Customizing Your Work Environment
181
When the panel expands, it makes room for itself by forcing the panels
below it down — unless it’s a panel on the bottom, in which case it forces
the panels above it up. If there’s not enough room on your monitor to show
all the panels open at once, Fireworks collapses the panel directly beneath
or above the one you expanded.
If you have a panel expanded but still can’t see quite enough of it, you can
drag the panel open wider or longer by clicking on the left or bottom edge of
the panel and dragging it.
In addition to collapsing and expanding panels, you can also open and close
panels. Check out Table 1-1, which includes the key commands for closing
and opening panels.

Moving, docking, and grouping panels
When you open Fireworks for the first time, all the panels are docked and
grouped in the default configuration. (Refer to Figure 1-3 to see this default
configuration.) However, undocking and moving panels and putting them in
custom groups is easy.
To move a panel, follow these steps:
1. Click the gripper at the top left of the panel.
The gripper is made up of two parallel lines of dots at the top left, on
the panel’s title bar.
2. Drag the panel to the spot on the screen where you would like it to go.
3. Release the mouse button.
You now see the panel in the position you selected, in its own window,
as shown in Figure 1-4.

Customizing Your Work Environment
182
When you move a panel, you automatically undock it, but you don’t auto-
matically dock it somewhere else when you release the mouse button. The
panel remains floating in the Fireworks window until you dock it. To dock a
panel, follow these steps:
1. Place your cursor over the gripper at the top left of the panel.
The gripper is made up of two parallel lines of dots at the top left, on
the panel’s title bar.
2. Drag the panel to a docking area.
A docking area is anywhere along the outer edge of the Document
window or adjacent to a docked panel. When you have dragged the
panel over a docking area, a rectangle appears on the screen to give you
a preview of the space the panel would occupy if you docked it there.
3. Release the mouse button.
The panel is docked in its expanded state.
Fireworks allows you the option to consolidate or group panels, which pro-
vides a nice way to put the panels you like using together. To group a panel
with another panel, follow these steps:

1. Click the Panel Options icon (the three white lines and arrow) at the
top right of the panel you want to add to a group.
The Panel Options menu appears.
2. Select the Group Layers With option.
An additional pop-up menu appears.
3. Choose the panel you want to group the currently selected panel with.
The panel you added appears as a tab in the panel to which you added it.
Follow these steps to remove a panel from a group:
1. Click the tab of the panel you want to separate from the group.
2. Click the Panel Options icon at the top right of the panel.
The Panel Options menu appears.
3. Select the Close Panel Group option.
This closes not only the panel you want to close, but also any other
panels in that group.
4. Reopen any panels from the group that you didn’t want to close by
choosing them from the Window menu.
If you have moved your panels around and docked them to accommodate a
particular project or document, you can save your panel arrangement by
choosing Commands➪Panel Layout Sets➪Save Panel Layout and giving
your settings a name. You can then retrieve that layout set-up from the 
same location.
Setting Fireworks Preferences
Setting preferences allows you to customize the way Fireworks handles 
certain basic functions and displays certain items. To edit Fireworks prefer-
ences, choose Edit➪Preferences or use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+U.
As you can see in Figure 1-5, the Preferences dialog box has five tabs:
✦General
✦Editing
✦Launch and Edit
✦Folders
✦Import

Setting Fireworks Preferences
184
Setting General preferences
You can select the General tab on the Preferences dialog box and customize
the following settings:
✦Undo Steps: Set the value from 0 to 999. This setting affects Edit➪Undo/
Redo and also increases the number of possible steps in the History
panel. Be aware, however, that the more Undo steps you allow, the more
memory Fireworks requires. You must close and relaunch Fireworks to
use the new setting.
✦Color Defaults: Set the default colors for Stroke (a line or border), Fill
(the inside of a shape), and Highlight (the color that indicates what you
currently have selected). To apply the changes to the default Stroke and
Fill colors in the current document, you must click the Set Default
Stroke/Fill Colors button in the Tools panel.
✦Interpolation: Choose one of the four methods that Fireworks can use
to render a change to the image size:
• Bicubic Interpolation, the default method, generally yields the 
highest-quality results.
• Soft Interpolation blurs the image slightly.
• Bilinear Interpolation gives a sharpness level somewhere in
between Bicubic and Soft.
• Nearest Neighbor Interpolation sharpens edges.
For more details on changing image size, see Book III, Chapter 2.
✦Launch options: Select this check box if you want to see the Start Page
when you launch Fireworks; deselect the check box if you don’t want to
see the Start Page.

Setting Editing preferences
Select the Edit tab to access these editing preferences in Fireworks:
✦Precise Cursors: Select this check box if you prefer to use cross hairs as
a cursor instead of the custom cursors for each tool.
✦Delete Objects When Cropping: Leave this check box selected if you
want to delete objects and pixels that fall outside the area to which you
crop your image.
✦Brush-Size Painting Cursors: Select this check box if you want the
cursor size to represent the size of stroke you are about to make.
✦Bitmap Option: Select the Turn Off “Hide Edges” check box if you
always want to see the path selection feedback of a selected object.
✦Pen Tool Options: You have two options here:
• Select the Show Pen Preview check box if you want Fireworks to
show what your path will look like (before you actually draw the
line) based on the position of your cursor.
• Select the Show Solid Points check box if you want selected points
to appear hollow and deselected points to appear solid.
✦Pointer Tool Options: You have several options here:
• Select the Mouse Highlight check box if you want an object’s selection
feedback (the box that indicates that an object has been selected) to
activate when you roll the cursor over that object.
• Select the Preview Drag check box if you want to see an object as
you drag it.
• Select the Show Fill Handles check box if you want to be able to drag
handles to change the position, width, skew, and rotation of a gradi-
ent fill.
• Set the value of the Pick Distance option from 1 to 10 to specify how
close in pixels your cursor needs to be to an object for you to
select it.
• Set the value of the Snap Distance option from 1 to 10 to specify how
close to a grid or guide in pixels an object must be before the object
snaps to the grid or guide.
Setting Launch and Edit preferences
You set the Launch and Edit preferences to specify how you want Fireworks
to act when it’s launched from within other applications in the Macromedia
Studio MX 2004 suite.

Setting Fireworks Preferences
186
The options are the same whether you are choosing options under When
Editing from External Application or When Optimizing from External
Application:
✦Select the Ask When Launching option if you want Fireworks to ask you
whether or not to edit the PNG source file when you launch Fireworks
from within another application.
✦Select the Always Use Source PNG option if you want Fireworks always
to find the source PNG for editing an image from within another 
application.
✦Select the Never Use Source PNG option when you never want Fireworks
to locate and make available for editing the source file for an image you
are editing from within another application.
In most cases (with Macromedia Flash being an exception), if you edit an
image by launching Fireworks from within another application, Fireworks
attempts to locate the source PNG file for editing, regardless of the Launch
and Edit preferences.
Setting Folders preferences
Fireworks comes with its own effects, textures, and patterns, but the appli-
cation allows you to access additional materials for use in modifying bitmap
images. Select the Folders tab to gain access to the following:
✦Photoshop Plug-Ins: If you have Photoshop plug-ins you want to be able
to use in Fireworks, select the Photoshop Plug-Ins check box. Use the
dialog box to browse to the folder that holds those plug-ins.
✦Textures: If you have additional textures you would like to access from
within Fireworks, select the Textures check box. Use the dialog box to
browse to the folder that has the texture files.
✦Patterns: If you have additional patterns you would like to access from
within Fireworks, select the Patterns check box. Use the dialog box to
browse to the folder that has the pattern files.
If you change these preferences, you need to quit and relaunch Fireworks
for the changes to take effect.
You can access the effects, textures, and patterns from the Property inspec-
tor when you select an object.
Setting Import preferences
Set the Import preferences to tell Fireworks how you want to convert
Photoshop (.psd) files for editing in Fireworks:

Book III
Chapter 1
Introduction to

Getting Help
187
✦Layers: Three options are grouped under this heading:
• Select Convert to Fireworks Objects if you want Fireworks to make
each Photoshop layer into an object on its own Fireworks layer.
• Select the Share Layer Between Frames check box if you want each
layer of the Photoshop file to be shared across all Fireworks frames.
• Select Convert to Frames if you want Fireworks to import each
Photoshop layer as a Fireworks frame. That can save you a few steps
if the Photoshop file has layers that correspond to animation frames
or button states.
✦Text: Three options are grouped under this heading:
• Select Editable if you want to edit text layers from the Photoshop file
using the Fireworks Text tool. The text may look slightly different in
Fireworks, though it will be close.
• Select Maintain Appearance if you need the text in Fireworks to look
identical to the text in Photoshop but do not need to edit the text.
• Select the Use Flat Composite Image check box if you want to import
the Photoshop file as a flattened, one-layer image.
Getting Help
Fireworks offers several forms of assistance to users. If you can’t find the
answer to your question in this book, you have several good options avail-
able to you:
✦The Help menu: This menu offers links to appropriate parts of the
Macromedia Web site and an indexed, searchable online manual.
Press F1 to access the online manual at any time when you’re using
Fireworks. The online manual is always where we go first when we
need to figure out how to do something in Fireworks.
✦Fireworks tutorials: There are two basic Fireworks tutorials, one on
Graphic Design Basics and the other on Web Design Basics. You can
download them from the Web by clicking the “Take a Fireworks Tutorial”
link on the Fireworks Start page and then clicking the “Macromedia
Fireworks MX Tutorials” link in the Macromedia Fireworks MX 2004
Documentation section at the top of the page. Then click to download
the appropriate PDF and source files for your platform (PC or Mac).
The tutorials are quick, easy, and very helpful to the novice.
✦The installation CD-ROM: The CD-ROM from which you installed
Fireworks contains a couple of searchable, printable PDF files:

Getting Help
188
• The Using Fireworks PDF offers the basics.
• The Extending Fireworks PDF describes how you can use JavaScript
to control every command and setting in Fireworks.
You can copy the PDFs into the Fireworks folder on your hard drive
so you don’t have to rummage around for the installation CD when
you have a question the Help menu can’t answer.
✦Tooltips: Tooltips are built into the Fireworks user interface. Hover
the cursor over an interface element to see a brief description of the 
element’s function or capabilities.
If none of these resources gives you an answer to your question,
Macromedia offers both free Web-based support (including online forums)
and fee-based support via e-mail and telephone.

 Switching the view of your document
 Saving your documents
 Changing a document’s size
 Understanding color management
I
n this chapter, we introduce some of the basic processes of working with
Fireworks MX 2004. If you’re a regular computer user, many of these
processes will already be second nature to you. We show you how to create
and save a Fireworks document, how to change the magnification of your
document, and how to change the size of your document. We also offer
an introduction to some issues regarding the way colors are displayed on
the Web.
Creating a New Document
Before you can start creating or editing cool images with Fireworks, you
need to start the program and either create a brand-new blank document or
open an existing image that you want to change. You can open Fireworks in
several ways:
✦Select Fireworks MX 2004 from the Start menu.
✦Click the Fireworks icon in your taskbar or double-click the icon on your
desktop, if you have either of those options available.
✦Double-click the icon of an existing Fireworks PNG file.
✦Double-click the icon of any image associated with Fireworks. (During
installation, you can choose which file types will be associated with
Fireworks, including GIFs and JPEGs.)

Creating a New Document
190
No matter how you open Fireworks, you can create a new Fireworks docu-
ment by following these steps:
1. Choose File➪New or press Ctrl+N.
The New Document dialog box opens, displaying options for the size
and background color of your canvas, as well as the resolution of your
document, as shown in Figure 2-1. The default for all these settings is
determined by the settings of the most recently opened Fireworks docu-
ment. If those settings are what you want, simply click OK. Otherwise,
continue with the following steps.
2. Type numbers in the Width and Height text fields to set the width and
height of your canvas; use the drop-down list to select whether you
want the width and height of the canvas measured in pixels, inches,
or centimeters.
If you’re designing for the Web, pixels are most appropriate, because
pixels are the basic display units on computer monitors. If you’re
designing for print, inches or centimeters may work better.
You can use different units of measurement for the width and height,
although it would probably be more confusing than helpful.
3. Set the canvas color.
The default canvas color is white. You can also set the canvas to be
transparent, which can be useful if you’re making a graphic that you
want to have a transparent background. If your Web page is going to use
a particular color for the background, click the square to use the eye-
dropper to choose a color from the color picker, as shown in Figure 2-2.
4. Click OK.
Your canvas opens to the specified size and with the specified back-
ground color.

Changing Views of Your Document
After you start adding stuff to your canvas, you may find that you want to
make adjustments too fine to eyeball with the canvas at 100 percent size.
Fireworks offers several ways for you to increase and decrease the magnifi-
cation of your canvas. Changing the magnification doesn’t affect your docu-
ment’s size, it just changes your view of it, as if you’re looking at your
document through a magnifying glass.
To increase the magnification of the canvas so you can make fine adjust-
ments, use one of the following methods:
✦Choose View➪Zoom In or press Ctrl+=. Repeat as necessary to achieve
the desired view.
✦Choose View➪Magnification, and then select a magnification percent-
age greater than 100 percent. If you use this method, you can select
your magnification percentage directly, rather than stepping through
each level. Figure 2-3 shows this selection method.
✦Click the Magnification drop-down list at the bottom-right of the
canvas and select from the list of preset magnification levels.
✦Click the Zoom tool in the View section of the Tools panel, and then
click on the canvas. If you press Ctrl+Z, you can click and drag the
Zoom tool to Zoom in on the selected area of the canvas.
If your canvas is larger than the window in which you are viewing it, you can
decrease the magnification of the canvas so you can see the entire document
by using one of the following methods:
✦Choose View➪Zoom Out or press Ctrl+-. Repeat as necessary to
achieve the view you want.
✦Choose View➪Magnification, and then select a magnification percent-
age less than 100 percent. If you use this method, you can select your
magnification percentage directly, rather than stepping through
each level.

✦Click the Magnification drop-down list at the bottom of the canvas
and select from the list of preset magnification levels.
✦Click the Zoom tool in the View section of the Tools panel, and then
hold down the Alt key and click on the canvas. Notice that when you
press the Alt key while the Zoom tool is over the canvas, the plus sign in
the tool changes to a minus sign to indicate you can click to zoom out.
Several of the most common magnification levels can be accessed in one
step with the key commands listed in Table 2-1.

Saving Documents
You may have read this elsewhere, but it bears repeating: Save early and
save often. We can’t think of anything worse than working for hours on an
image, getting it just perfect, and having a power outage or other mishap
wipe out all that work in one cruel second.
Spare yourself the frustration of losing your work and save your documents
often by choosing File➪Save or by pressing Ctrl+S. When you save a file you
created in Fireworks using this method, you save the file in the native
Fireworks file format, PNG.
When you open and edit a TIFF, BMP, WBMP, GIF or JPEG, you can save as
that file type, instead of saving the edited file as a PNG. To exercise the
option, just save by choosing File➪Save or by pressing Ctrl+S. If you’ve
added Fireworks-specific things like slices or frames to your file, a dialog
box appears, asking how you want to save the file. If you save the file as its
original format, you’ll lose any of those Fireworks-specific features.
You can still use the Undo command after you have saved, so it never really
hurts to save your document. However, if you are concerned with preserving
intermediate versions of a document, you can save versions, rather than
saving over your previous work. If you want to try several different approaches
to a design but don’t want to clog one file with all of the approaches, use the
Save As command and name the file with a slight variation. (For example,
if your file is named homepage.png, you could name a second version
homepage_v02.png.) When you Save As, any changes to the file since you
last saved it will be saved in the new version of the file, not the old one.
To save a version of your document, follow these simple steps:
1. Choose File➪Save or press Ctrl+S to save the file in its current state,
with its current name.
2. Choose File➪Save As or press Ctrl+Shift+S.
The Save As dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 2-4.
3. Type a new filename.
If you have already named the file, the current name is filled in for you,
so you need to modify the filename in order to save the current version
of the document.
4. If you are editing a non-PNG file and want to save the file in its origi-
nal format, use the Save As Type drop-down list to select the format.
5. Click OK.
The new version of the file is now open and ready for modification.

Modifying Document Size

Modifying Document Size
You can modify the size of your Fireworks document in two fundamentally
different ways. With these methods, you’re changing the actual dimensions
of the document, not just the magnification of the canvas:
✦Changing the image size: When you change the image size, Fireworks
recreates the entire document, including everything on the canvas, at a
different height and/or width.
✦Changing the canvas size: When you change the canvas size, you do
not change the size of the objects on the canvas, you only change the
size of the space on which you put the material, as if you cut the top,
bottom, or sides off a printed picture (or pasted extra strips on, if
you’re increasing the canvas size). You can use the crop tool to reduce
the canvas size, or you can use a dialog box to increase or reduce the
canvas size.
Changing the image size
To change the image size of your document, you use the Image Size dialog
box, which is accessed by choosing Modify➪Canvas➪Image Size. When you
change the image size of your document, you change the dimensions of the
canvas and of everything on the canvas. If you shrink your image, Fireworks
discards some of the data when it reorders the pixels to make the image
smaller.
If you increase the size of your image, Fireworks interpolates data, which
entails performing sophisticated calculations to decide what color of pixels
to add and where to add them in order to make a larger version of the

image. While Fireworks interpolates smartly, some amount of distortion is
inevitable.
Using the Image Size dialog box, you can choose which method Fireworks
uses to interpolate or resample pixels:
✦Bicubic interpolation: Bicubic interpolation is the default method and
generally yields the highest-quality results with the widest variety of
images by taking an average of the nearest 16 pixels in the original
image size to create a new pixel in the resized image.
✦Soft interpolation: This method blurs the image slightly. Why would
you want the resized image to be slightly blurred? Because resizing can
result in visual inconsistencies in the image called artifacts. Blurring the
image takes the edge off the artifacts, rather like a soft-focus lens makes
a starlet’s skin look smoother.
✦Bilinear interpolation: The bilinear method gives a sharpness level
somewhere in between Bicubic and Soft.
✦Nearest-neighbor interpolation: This method sharpens edges, so it
works best on images that don’t have subtle gradients. If you use this
method on a bitmap of a sunset, for example, you’ll get banding —
noticeable stripes of color instead of a smooth blending of colors.
When you shrink your image, Fireworks discards some pixels and replaces a
few to smooth out the resized image. If you have a 400 x 300 image that you
shrink to 240 x 180, and then you enlarge it back to its original size, the
image you end up with will not be identical to the original image. However,
as long as the size changes aren’t extreme, you may not notice much of a 
difference.
If the Constrain Proportions check box is selected in the Image Size dialog
box, as it is by default, and you change the width in the Pixel Dimensions
part of the dialog box, the height in that part of the dialog box updates 
automatically, as does the width and height in the Print Size part of the
dialog box. If you change the image resolution in the Print Size part of the
dialog box, the width and height in both Pixel Dimensions and Print Size
updates automatically.
The Pixel Dimensions and Print Size widths and heights are identical, they’re
just being measured with different units. (You can set Pixel Dimensions and
Print Size to use the same units of measurement.)
To change the image size of your document, with the intention of displaying
the image online, follow these steps:

Modifying Document Size
196
1. Choose Modify➪Canvas➪Image Size.
The Image Size dialog box appears, with the current image size and reso-
lution as the defaults, as shown in Figure 2-5.
2. Type new numbers in the Width and Height text fields in the Pixel
Dimensions part of the dialog box to set the new width and height 
for your image; use the drop-down list to select whether you want
to change the width and height of the image based on pixels or 
percentages.
If you’re designing for the Web, pixels are most appropriate, because
pixels are the standard units of computer monitor display. If you’re
designing for print, inches or centimeters may work better. If you want
your new image to have the same aspect ratio (the ratio of width to
height, for example, 4:3 for an image that is 400 x 300 pixels) as your
current image, leave the Constrain Proportions check box selected. A
padlock icon at the right indicates that proportions will be constrained.
If you want to stretch or squash everything in your image as if it were
reflected in a funhouse mirror, deselect the Constrain Proportions check
box and make sure the new width and height dimensions don’t preserve
the aspect ratio of the old width and height (the simplest way to do that
is to change only height or only width).
You can use different units of measurement for the width and height,
although doing so offers no advantages.
3. Select a method for resampling your image, or leave at the default.
Resampling settings (Bicubic interpolation or Soft interpolation, for
example) are discussed earlier in this section.
4. Click OK.
The image resizes.

To change the image size of your document for the purpose of printing it,
follow these steps:
1. Choose Modify➪Canvas➪Image Size.
The Image Size dialog box appears, with the current image size and reso-
lution as the defaults.
2. Set the image resolution for print in the Print Size section of the
Image Size dialog box.
Computer screen resolution is standardized at 72 dots per inch (dpi).
Most printers nowadays print at resolutions of anywhere from 300 dpi
to 2400 dpi. If you are designing for the Web and are working with a 
resolution of 72 dpi, changing the resolution here does not increase
the resolution of any of your bitmaps (that’s kind of like trying to focus
a photograph after you’ve already taken it), but it ensures that the 
printout fills the page properly.
3. Type new numbers in the Width and Height text fields in the Print
Size part of the dialog box; use the drop-down list to change the 
measurement units, if desired.
If the Constrain Proportions check box is selected, as it is by default,
and you want the printed image to have the same aspect ratio as the
current image, skip to Step 4. You can deselect the Constrain
Proportions check box and type new numbers in the Width and Height
text fields if you want to stretch or smash your image.
You can use different units of measurement for the width and height,
although doing so offers no advantages.
4. Leave the Resample Image check box selected unless you want to
change the image size by changing the image resolution.
If you change the image resolution, you change the number of pixels per
inch.
5. Click OK.
The image resizes.
Changing the canvas size
Making the canvas size smaller is akin to removing strips from the outside of
a drawing or painting. Whatever is on those strips gets discarded with the
strips. In other words, when you reduce the canvas size, you are essentially
cropping or cutting out a piece of the image.
Making the canvas size bigger is like sewing extra strips onto the outside
edges of a canvas. You add space to the canvas without changing the size of
anything already sitting on it.

Modifying Document Size
198
To reduce the canvas size, follow these steps:
1. Choose Modify➪Canvas➪Canvas Size.
The Canvas Size dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 2-6. The default
width and height dimensions when the dialog box opens are the current
dimensions of the document.
2. Type new numbers for the width and height in the text fields, and
select the measurement units for the width and height.
Your choice is, as elsewhere, pixels, inches, or centimeters.
3. Select the anchor area.
Because you are cutting off part of your canvas, you must set the
anchor to tell Fireworks which edges of the canvas to discard:
• If you click one of the top three squares, Fireworks preserves the top
and cuts off any pixels below the height you have set.
• If you click one of the middle three squares, Fireworks removes the
top and bottom of the existing document.
• If you click one of the bottom squares, Fireworks cuts off any pixels
above the height you have set.
• If you choose one of the left three squares, Fireworks discards any
pixels to the right of the width you have set.
• If you choose one of the middle three squares, Fireworks chops off
the pixels on either side of the width you have set.
• If you choose one of the right three squares, Fireworks lops off
everything to the left of the width you have set.

4. Click OK.
The canvas resizes.
If you’re not sure of the dimensions of the image you want, but you know
which area of the current image you want to keep, you can reduce the
canvas size by using the Crop tool. See Book III, Chapter 1 for information
about how to use the Crop tool.
To increase the canvas size, just follow these steps:
1. Choose Modify➪Canvas➪Canvas Size.
A dialog box opens, showing the current document dimensions.
2. Type the new width and height in the Width and Height text fields
and select the measurement units for the width and height.
You can choose pixels, inches, or centimeters.
3. Select the anchor area.
Because you are appending an area to your canvas, you must set the
anchor to tell Fireworks where to put the new area:
• If you click one of the top three squares, Fireworks adds the space to
the bottom of your current canvas.
• If you click one of the middle squares, Fireworks adds equal space to
the top and bottom of your current canvas.
• If you click one of the bottom squares, Fireworks adds space to the
top of your current canvas.
• If you click one of the left three squares, Fireworks adds space to the
right of your current canvas.
• If you click one of the center three squares, Fireworks adds equal
space to the left and right of your current canvas.
• If you click one of the right three squares, Fireworks adds space to
the left of your current canvas.

three colors. When you work in FreeHand MX, you have the option to design
using CMYK colors (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Black). CMYK is the process
used in offset printing. If you are creating an image to be used for printing,
be sure to set a resolution of at least 300 dpi in the Image Size dialog box
before you put any bitmap objects in your Fireworks document. Better yet,
use FreeHand to make the image; you can import the image into Fireworks if
you want to deploy it on the Web. (See Book III, Chapter 8 for information
about integrating Fireworks and FreeHand, and see Book IV for more about
how to use FreeHand.)
Because Fireworks is made for Web design, it only uses the RGB color spec-
trum; all its color options are combinations of red, green, and blue. The fol-
lowing section explains how you use hexadecimal numbers to create
different colors using the RGB color spectrum.
Hexadecimal numbers
When you are designing a Web page, you select a background color and
HTML text colors. In HTML, colors are specified by using hexadecimal 
numbers — the # symbol, followed by six digits (from 0 through 9) or
letters (A through F). Zero represents the bottom of the scale (zero 
luminosity) and F represents the top of the scale (full luminosity).
The hexadecimal number’s six places operate as three pairs. The first pair
represents red, the second pair represents green, and the third pair repre-
sents blue. For example, to make the background color for your page white,
you would write the following code:
<BODY bgcolor=”#FFFFFF”>
In order to make white, you need to set each color to its highest luminosity,
which is represented by the pair, “FF.” If you wanted to put black text on
your page, you could use the following code:
<FONT color=”#000000”>text</FONT>
In order to make black, you need to set each color to its lowest luminosity,
which is represented by the pair, “00.” If you don’t understand what the
code is all about in the examples above, see Book II on Dreamweaver
MX 2004.
The hexadecimal expression of a pure RGB red is #FF0000; a pure green is
#00FF00; and a pure blue is #0000FF. The number of possible colors is a bit

mind-boggling: It’s in the millions. Only a small subset of those possible
colors is Web safe, though.
Web safe colors
In the early days of the Web, many computer monitors could display only
256 colors. Because 40 of those colors were reserved for the computer’s
operating system or were otherwise off-limits, that left 216 colors available
for use on Web sites: the Web safe colors. When you set your monitor’s reso-
lution to the 8-bit display option, your monitor can show only that old set of
256 colors. What happens when you look at an image that has colors that
don’t fall into that set of 256? Your computer approximates the colors it
can’t display either by a process called dithering or by changing the colors
to ones that it can display.
Dithering is the process of combining two or more colors in order to mimic
another color. Offset printing uses an analogous process in order to make
many colors out of the four CMYK ink colors. If you look at a color image in
a newspaper or magazine through a magnifying glass, you see that it’s made
up of many little colored dots and holes. Viewed from a certain distance,
those tiny dots blend together to form what appear to be solid colors. For
example, you may see orange with your naked eyes, but if you look closely
with a magnifying glass, you see alternating yellow and magenta dots on
that newspaper or magazine page.
When a computer dithers a color, it patterns two colors to create the illu-
sion of a third color. As with a color photo in a newspaper, this strategy
works only to a limited extent. If you look closely, you can see the pattern. If
the dithered color is used just for a line or some small page element, the
dither may be rather innocuous. If, on the other hand, you select non-Web
safe colors for your page background and/or text colors, people who view
your site using a monitor set to 8-bit may have a difficult time trying to read
the text on your Web site.
If users have their monitors set to 16-bit and they’re looking at a 24-bit color,
they get a dithered color also, but the higher resolution of 16-bit versus 8-bit
means that the computer can choose closer colors, so the dither doesn’t
look as obvious. Note that the more colors you have in your image, the
larger the file size.
So should you use only Web safe colors when you design your Web site?
Isn’t that terribly limiting? After all, the Web safe colors were not selected by
designers, and there are some really ugly ones in the bunch!

An Introduction to Color Management
202
Go ahead and use non-Web safe colors, but think about what you’re using
them for and how likely it may be that the people visiting your site may only
be able to see them dithered.
In the early days of the Web, when most Web surfers had 8-bit monitors and
used early browsers, designers would predither all their images. That way,
images would look essentially the same to all users, whether the users had
Variability and Web design
One of the most frustrating aspects of Web
design, especially for people trained in print
design, is that many design elements cannot be
accurately controlled. Monitor settings (both in
terms of number of colors displayed and pixel
resolution) vary from user to user, and colors on
Macintosh monitors appear lighter than they do
on PC monitors. Users can change the size of
HTML text in their browsers, and they can drag
their browser windows as wide or narrow as
they see fit. Not only that, download rates may
be anywhere from about 5K per second with a
56 Kbps modem, to twenty times that or more
with cable or DSL modems.
As a result, Web design always starts with a
consideration of the end user — the average
person who’s going to visit the site. If your Web
site’s audience is going to be made up mostly of
college students who have high-speed Internet
access in their dorms, or people working in
large companies who have high-speed Internet
access at their desks, you can get away with
making image file sizes larger. You also can
assume those people have their monitors set to
16-bit (thousands of colors) or 24-bit (millions of
colors), since it looks better and all computers
sold nowadays come with video cards that can
display at least 16-bit color. What you know
about your potential end users should affect
your choices of colors for page background,
HTML text, and GIFs.
If you have a mix of business users and home
users, you have to make some compromises in
page width, image quality, and other things. If
your users are mostly older, you may want to
make your default text size a little bigger than
average, or you may be satisfied simply to
design your page in such a way as to accom-
modate a larger text size. You should always try
to choose a text color that contrasts fairly
sharply with the background color.
Web designers have a phrase that describes
what your design should be able to do so that
all users can have a satisfactory experience on
your site: Your design should degrade grace-
fully. That is, where you do not want to compro-
mise quality or remove features to bring every
user’s experience down to the lowest common
denominator, make sure that users with the
least fancy equipment or with disabilities can
still access your important content. For exam-
ple, blind users will have access to any text on
your site via screen reader software (which
reads the text on your site aloud) or Braille soft-
ware and hardware. For more information on
accessibility issues and standards, visit the
World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Web site at

8-bit displays or 16-bit displays. Nowadays, browsers have become more
sophisticated, and monitors that display at 16-bit and higher are affordable
to average computer owners. As a result, designers have decided that in cer-
tain cases, it’s better to allow inconsistency in the realm of display in order
to offer higher image quality to better-equipped users.
In keeping with tradition, though, Fireworks still uses the Web safe color
palette as its default in the color picker.
In the next chapter, we get into the nitty-gritty of applying all this color stuff
to the real-life situations of choosing colors for page backgrounds, HTML
text, and the like.

n this chapter, we explore the power that Fireworks MX 2004 gives you to
write and edit text, make and manipulate vector shapes, and create and
mutate bitmap images. The control that you have with Fireworks may some-
times seem overwhelming, but the number of its tools is limited and the
concepts behind the tools are simple. And whether you have a clear idea
about what you want, or you’re interested in experimenting, Fireworks suits
your needs.
Working with Text
Text is the most common element on most Web pages, much as text is the
most common element in magazines and newspapers. Unlike with printed
material, however, users can alter the size and appearance of HTML text to
a certain extent. Some of the most important decisions you make in building
your Web site involve how you present text on the screen. In general, a fin-
ished Web page has two kinds of text:
✦HTML text: The text you see on the Web page that is created with
HTML. This type of text is akin to the text in word-processing software
such as Microsoft Word.
✦Graphic text: The text that’s embedded in an image, such as a JPEG or a
GIF file. In other words, it’s a picture of text.
Which method of presenting text is better for you and people viewing your
Web site depends largely on the function of the text.
Some advantages of using HTML text include the following:
✦HTML text is smaller (in kilobytes) and therefore loads faster in a user’s
Web browser.

Working with Text
206
✦Visitors can vary the size of the text by changing settings in their
browsers.
✦Special software and hardware (in the case of Braille) can make HTML
text available to blind users via audio or touch.
Remember, always use an ALT tag for graphic text. The ALT tag should
say what the graphic text says, so blind users have access to it.
✦Visitors to your site can select, copy, and paste HTML text into e-mails
or word-processing documents, which can help spread the word you’re
trying to get out via your Web site.
On the downside, HTML text tends to be limited to very basic fonts — those
available on all computers, notably Arial and Times — and can be presented
in only a limited number of ways.
Graphic text, in contrast, is much more visually dynamic than HTML text,
because it’s part of an image. That’s why graphic text is common for buttons
and banners, which need to grab the user’s attention. Some of the key
advantages to using graphic text include the following:
✦You can create text using any font that’s installed on your computer.
✦You can apply lots of different effects to text, like glows and 
drop-shadows.
✦You have greater control of things like leading (the spacing between
lines of text) and kerning (the spacing between letters).
Of course, using graphic text also has drawbacks. Users can’t copy and
paste text from a graphic, for example. Also, because the graphic text is
part of an image, the size (in kilobytes) of the text is larger than that of
plain HTML text.
Regardless of the kind of text you’re creating, Fireworks can be of help. The
following sections show how you can use the Fireworks text editing tools to
create text as part of an image, as well as export text in HTML format.
If you want to include your main HTML text in your Fireworks document, or
if you want to use placeholder text that will be replaced with final HTML
text later in Dreamweaver, use the Fireworks text default, 12 point Arial or
Verdana (with no anti-alias), in your page design. Using one of those settings
gives you a good approximation of how the text will look on the HTML page
you make from your design.

207
Creating text with the Text tool
Creating text with Fireworks is a snap, which is good because you do a lot of
it when you’re creating images and page mockups. To create some text, just
follow these three easy steps:
1. Select the Text tool by clicking the capital A in the Vector section of
the Tools panel.
An I-shaped pointer appears, as shown in Figure 3-1.
2. Move the pointer to the point on the canvas where you want to create
the text.
3. Click on the canvas and type away.
You can always move the text later, as well as change its font or color. We
cover those details later in this chapter.
If the text you want to add already exists in a word-processing program,
open the text document, select the applicable text, and copy it. Then select
the Text tool in Fireworks, click on the canvas, and press Ctrl+V to paste the
text. Your text appears in the default font.
Figure 3-1:

Working with Text
208
If you’re pasting text into your Fireworks document, set the width of the text
box before you paste the text in. The default Fireworks text box expands
outward to the right rather than downward. To set the width of the text box,
select the Text tool from the Tools panel, and click and drag diagonally on
the canvas to create a text box of the right size. If your text is too long to fit
in the box you’ve created, the box expands downward automatically.
Selecting a font and changing its size
After you create a snippet of text, you can select it for editing in one of
three ways:
✦After selecting the Text tool, select the text you want to edit by clicking
and dragging to highlight just the desired text.
✦Using the Pointer tool, double-click the text you created. Doing so 
activates the Text tool and makes the text available for editing.
✦Using the Pointer tool, click once on the text you’ve created. Doing
so selects the entire text box. When you edit the text settings in the
Property inspector, Fireworks applies the changes to all the text in
the box.
After you select text, notice that the Property inspector switches auto-
matically to show the available text properties that you can apply to your
selected text, including bold, italic, various text alignments, and effects like
drop shadow and glow.
You can change your text to a different font in one of two ways:
✦Choose a font from the drop-down list (that’s the list displaying the
default font, Arial on the PC and Geneva on the Mac) in the Property
inspector. The drop-down list displays all the fonts you have in your
machine in alphabetical order. Note that as you scroll through the list,
the list displays the name of the selected font using the font face itself
so you can quickly see what each font looks like. Figure 3-2 shows the
Property inspector when text is selected.
✦Choose Text➪Font, and then select from the list of fonts displayed on
the screen.
If you have tons of fonts and your favorite is way down the list, you can skip
to it by clicking in the scrolling drop-down list in the Property inspector and
typing the first letter of the font name on your keyboard. This jumps you to
the first font available with that letter. You can then press the down-arrow
key to find the font you’re looking for. Press Enter to apply the font to the
selected text. Unfortunately, this feature is not available on the Mac.

Book III
Chapter 3

Shapes, and Images

209
After you select a font, changing its size doesn’t take any time at all. You can
change a font size in Fireworks in one of two ways:
✦Use the Size field: The Property inspector contains a field indicating the
current size of the font you’re working with. To change the text size,
simply type the point size you’d like in the field and press Enter.
✦Use the Slider: Click and hold the arrow at the right of the Size field and
then slide it up. The text size increases. Similarly, slide it down and the
text size decreases, as shown in Figure 3-3.
Adding a little color
By default, all text in Fireworks is black. Although black is handy and always
in fashion, it’s not the right color for every occasion. Changing font color in
Fireworks is pretty easy. To change your color the basic way, just follow
these steps:
1. Select the Text tool and place the cursor next to the first word that
you want to change the color of. Click and drag until you’ve selected
all the text you want to make a different color.
Alternatively, if you’re using the Pointer tool, click the text once to
select it.

2. Click the Color box to open the color picker.
The color picker appears on-screen, showing only Web safe colors by
default (see Figure 3-4). Your mouse pointer changes to an eyedropper
when you roll over the palette. The System Color Picker, which offers
other color options, is discussed later in this section. You can move the
eyedropper anywhere within the Fireworks window.
3. Using the eyedropper, click a color.
The square is now the color you have selected for your text. More
importantly, your selected text is that color as well. If the text appears
to be a different color than the square, that’s because the text is high-
lighted. Click anywhere on the canvas or click any tool to deselect the
text and see the color applied to the text.
If you don’t feel like moving your mouse all the way to the bottom of the
screen, you can also change the color of your font by using the Colors area
of the Tools panel. It works the same way as the color picker in the Property
inspector, but you save moving that extra inch or so down the screen.
The color picker contains a number of different views. The default view is
Web safe color cubes. You can switch views by clicking the right-facing 
triangle in the top-right corner of the color picker, and then selecting a new
view from the list that appears. The other views include the following:
✦Swatches panel: Displays your saved colors. If you have any saved
colors, they show up here. If not, the panel displays the Web safe
palette.
✦Continuous tone: Shows the colors as they move from lighter to darker
left to right across the color picker. These are the same colors as the
Web safe color cubes, just arranged differently.
✦Windows OS: Shows the 217 Web safe colors that are also the Windows
operating system colors.

✦Mac OS: Shows the system colors for the Mac operating system.
✦Grayscale: Provides a range of grays from light to dark. Be warned
though, only six grayscale colors are Web safe!
What if the color you want isn’t in the Web safe palette? Well, thankfully,
Fireworks provides you with a number of different coloring options. On the
top of the palette is the System Color Picker (the color wheel near the
middle of the top of the color picker). You can click the System Color Picker
to see your other color options. The System Color Picker offers several
other ways for you to choose a color, as shown in Figure 3-5:
✦RGB values: Red, Green, and Blue are the colors that make up all the
colors you can see on-screen.
✦Hue, Saturation, and Luminosity values: A different way of telling the
computer how to combine red, blue, and green.
✦The color matrix: A visual representation of the Hue (the horizontal
axis), Saturation (the vertical axis), and Luminosity (the extra strip on
the right) values.
Using the color matrix gives you the most flexibility in choosing a color in
that you can visually pick precisely the color you want. Here’s how you use
the color matrix:
1. From the top middle of the color picker, select the System Color
Picker.
The Color dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 3-5.
2. Place your cursor over the color you want and click the mouse button.
You see a cross hair where you clicked. At the center of the cross hair 
is the color you chose. The higher you go in the matrix, the more 
Figure 3-5:

saturated the color becomes. If you want to make the color darker or
lighter, click the shade you want in the Luminosity bar next to the matrix,
or click and move the slider to the right of the shade. Note that, at this
point, you still haven’t changed the color of the text on the canvas.
3. Click OK to apply the color to your text.
The color is applied to the selected text on the canvas.
If you want to use a color frequently, click the Add to Custom Colors button
on the lower right after you select your custom color. That way, whenever
you need to use that color, you can click its square in the color picker
instead of having to remember its RGB values or trying to find it in the
color matrix.
Manipulating text
After you have typed or pasted your text, you can change anything about it,
from its color to its position on the page. The process of changing the color
is identical to the process of applying color in the first place, and you’ll find
that editing, moving, and deleting text is just as easy.
Inserting text
To insert text, just follow these steps:
1. Choose the Text tool from the Tools panel.
An I-beam-shaped cursor appears.
2. Click the place in the text box where you want to add text.
A blinking vertical line indicates where your new text will be inserted.
3. Start typing, or paste text (Ctrl+V) that you have copied from 
elsewhere.
Deleting text
To delete text, do the following:
1. Choose the Text tool from the Tools panel.
2. Click the place in the text box where you want to delete text.
3. Click and drag over the text you want to delete.
The selected text is highlighted, as shown in Figure 3-6.
4. Press Delete or cut the text by pressing Ctrl+X.
The highlighted text disappears.

Book III
Chapter 3

Working with Text
213
To delete an entire selection of text, select the Pointer tool, and then
click once on the text box that you want to delete. After the text box is
selected, press the Delete key to delete the text box and everything in it.
If you realize immediately that you deleted more than you intended, or
deleted the wrong chunk of text, use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Z to
undo the deletion.
Replacing text
To replace text, just follow these steps:
1. Choose the Text tool from the Tools panel.
2. Click the place in the text box where you want to replace text.
3. Click and drag over the text you want to delete.
The selected text is highlighted, as shown in Figure 3-6.
4. Start typing, or press Ctrl+V to paste in text you have copied from
elsewhere.
Moving text
To move text within a text box, do the following:
1. Choose the Text tool from the Tools panel.
2. Click and drag over the text you want to move.
The selected text is highlighted, as shown in Figure 3-6.
Figure 3-6:

3. Choose Edit➪Cut or press Ctrl+X to cut the text.
4. Click where you want to drop in the cut text.
A blinking vertical line indicates where your text will be inserted.
5. Choose Edit➪Paste or press Ctrl+V to paste the text at the insertion
point.
To move a text box, follow these steps:
1. Choose the Pointer tool.
2. Place the cursor anywhere over the text box.
An outline appears in red to indicate that your cursor is over the
text box.
3. Click anywhere within the text box and, with the mouse button held
down, drag to move the text box.
Fireworks shows you where the text is moving to.
4. Release the mouse button when the top left of your text is positioned
where you want it.
The text is relocated.
Changing text box dimensions
After you have moved your text box, you may find that the text is too wide,
too narrow, too long, or too short to fit in its new position in your design. Do
you have to change your text? Not necessarily. Fireworks allows you to
adjust the dimensions of your text box, which may be all you need to do.
To change the width or length of a text box, just follow these steps:
1. Choose the Pointer tool.
2. Place the cursor anywhere over the text box.
An outline appears in red to indicate that you have rolled over the
text box.
3. Click anywhere within the text box to select it.
The red outline changes to blue to indicate that you have selected the
entire text box.
4. Place the Pointer over one of the resize handles (the squares in the
middle of the right-hand or left-hand side, which allow you to change
the width of the box, and the squares in the corners, which allow you
to change the width and height at the same time).

Book III
Chapter 3

215
The Pointer (the black arrow) automatically changes to the
Subselection tool (the white arrow).
5. Click a resize handle and drag the box to the desired width or length.
6. Release the mouse button to see the change.
If you widen your text box, Fireworks automatically shortens it. If you
make your text box narrower, on the other hand, Fireworks makes the
text box longer. If you drag the box longer than it needs to be to hold
the text, the bottom of the box snaps to the lowest point your text
reaches to at the width you dragged the box to.
Working with Vector Shapes
Fireworks gives you two ways to draw on your canvas:
✦Vector mode: Uses points, lines, and shapes to define image elements
✦Bitmap mode: Uses pixels to define image elements
Each method has advantages and disadvantages, and which mode you use
depends on what you are attempting to do.
If you want to make a shape that you can easily tweak, resize, or export to
Macromedia Flash or FreeHand later, you will want to work in vector mode.
When you make a simple vector shape in Fireworks, what you are actually
creating is a mathematical model of a series of points connected by lines. By
adding, subtracting, or moving points, you can change the shape without
changing any of its other qualities, such as the line (stroke), width, and 
texture.
Because a simple vector shape is more a mathematical description of an
image than an actual image, its data size is small. Not only that, but a square
of a particular color and stroke width and gradient fill is basically the same
data size whether it’s 10 x 10 pixels or 1000 x 1000 pixels on-screen. That
becomes important in Macromedia Flash, in which smaller image data sizes
mean faster downloads.
The basic building block of a shape is the path. The path by itself is just a
set of coordinates; in order to make the path appear, you need to apply a
stroke. A stroke in Fireworks is like a brushstroke in painting. Stroke proper-
ties include width, texture, and color. The thicker the brush, the thicker the
stroke it makes. Of course, in Fireworks, you can make strokes with the
Pencil and Pen tools, and with other tools as well.
Read on to discover how to create and edit vector shapes.

Working with Vector Shapes
216
Making a good old-fashioned line
When you first create a line using the Line tool, it is a straight line (though it
can be vertical, horizontal, or diagonal). To create a line in Fireworks, just
follow these steps:
1. Select the Line tool from the Vector part of the Tools panel.
2. Place your cursor over the spot where you would like your line to start.
When your cursor is over the canvas, it becomes a cross hair. The
center of that cross hair is your point of contact with the canvas.
3. Click where you want your line to start and, holding the mouse
button down, move your cursor to where you want your line to end.
4. Release the mouse button.
By default, the stroke of your line is 1 pixel in width.
By popular demand, Macromedia has introduced dotted and dashed lines to
Fireworks MX 2004. You can access the dotted and dashed line stroke
options in the Stroke Category pop-up menu in the Property inspector, as
shown in Figure 3-7.

If you hold down the Shift key while you draw a line, you restrict the angle of
the line to 45-degree increments.
Making simple shapes
Fireworks has easy-to-use tools for creating rectangles (including squares),
ovals (including circles), and polygons. The tools for making all these
shapes are grouped with the Rectangle tool in the vector section of the
Tools panel. When you click the Rectangle tool and hold down the mouse
button, a pop-up menu displays three basic tools at the top:
✦The Rectangle tool: Use this tool to create squares and other rectangles.
✦The Ellipse tool: Use this tool to create round shapes like circles and
other ovals.
✦The Polygon tool: Use this tool to create many-sided shapes (up to 360-
sided). Use the Property inspector to set the number of sides before
you draw on the canvas. The slider includes values from 3 through 25;
for values greater than 25, you need to type a number in the field. By
default, the Polygon tool creates pentagons. Add three points and you
have an octagon, or delete two points to get a triangle.
See the section, “Making complex shapes,” later in this chapter, for informa-
tion on the tools below those three in the Rectangle tool pop-up menu.
To make a rectangle, follow these steps:
1. Select the Rectangle tool from the Vector section of the Tools panel.
2. Place your cursor over the point on the canvas where you want the
top-left corner of your rectangle.
Notice that the cursor has become a cross hair.
3. Click and drag to the spot where you want the bottom-right corner of
the rectangle, as shown in Figure 3-8.
To create a square, hold down the Shift key as you drag.
4. Release the mouse button.
The shape appears on the canvas.
To make an oval, follow these steps:
1. Select the Ellipse tool from the Vector section of the Tools panel by
clicking on the Rectangle tool and holding the mouse button down
until the pop-up menu with the Ellipse tool displays.

Working with Vector Shapes
218
2. Place your cursor over the point on the canvas where you want the
oval.
Your cursor becomes a cross hair.
3. Click and drag to create the oval.
To create a circle, hold down the Shift key as you drag.
An oval doesn’t have corners, so you may not be able to get precise place-
ment when you make the shape. That’s no big deal, though, because moving
the shape is easy, as we describe later in this chapter in the “Editing,
moving, and deleting shapes” section.
You can make an equilateral polygon (a shape in which all sides have equal
lengths) by following these steps:
1. Select the Polygon tool from the Vector section of the Tools panel by
clicking on the Rectangle tool and holding the mouse button down
until the pop-up menu with the Polygon tool displays.
2. At the right of the Property inspector, type the number of sides you
want the polygon to have, or use the slider next to the Sides text field
to set the number of sides.
By default, the polygon is five-sided. If you set the number of sides to 3
instead of 5, you draw a triangle. Set the number of sides to 6 and you
draw a hexagon. You can make a shape with up to 360 sides — just don’t
expect us to know what a polygon with 360 sides is called!

3. Place your cursor over the point on the canvas where you want the
shape.
Your cursor becomes a cross hair.
4. Click and drag to create the polygon.
The Property inspector changes to give you access to various proper-
ties of the polygon, including fill options, stroke options, and effects.
Making complex shapes
Fireworks MX 2004 introduces a new concept for creating shapes: AutoShapes.
You can make these complex shapes simply by choosing them directly from
the Rectangle tool’s pop-up menu:
✦Arrow
✦Beveled Rectangle
✦Chamfer Rectangle
✦Connector Line
✦Doughnut
✦L-Shape
✦Pie
✦Rounded Rectangle
✦Smart Polygon
✦Spiral
✦Star
If you can’t find the kind of shape you want to make in the Vector Shape tool
pop-up menu, you can make a custom freeform shape. Believe it or not,
making odd shapes is just as easy as making regular ones, and it may even
be more fun!
The main tool you use to create complex shapes is the Pen tool, found in the
Vectors section of the Tools panel. Like the Rectangle tool, the Pen tool
comes with some variations, which you can access by clicking and holding
the mouse button down on the Pen tool. The pop-up menu for the Pen tool
displays the following variations:
✦The Pen tool: Use the Pen tool to place points on the page; Fireworks
connects the dots for you.
✦The Vector Path tool: Use the Vector Path tool to draw as you would
with a felt-tip marker. You can manipulate the path in ways unavailable

Working with Vector Shapes
220
if you’d used a bitmap tool (or a real felt-tip marker) — see “Editing,
moving and deleting shapes,” later in this chapter.
✦The Redraw Path tool: Use the Redraw Path tool to change the length
or shape of a path you have already created.
To make a freeform shape with straight lines, follow these steps:
1. Select the Pen tool from the Vector section of the Tools panel.
2. Place the cursor over the canvas.
Your cursor becomes a fountain pen.
3. Click to make your starting point.
4. Move your cursor and click to create a second point.
Fireworks connects the dots with a straight line.
5. Move your cursor and click to create a third point, and, if you like, a
fourth, fifth, tenth, or one hundred forty-second point.
6. If you want a closed shape, click again on your starting point to close
the shape. Otherwise, double-click the end point to make an open
shape.
Making curved lines with the Pen tool can be a little difficult initially. If you
know a few things about the Pen tool, using it to make curved lines will be a
little easier. First of all, you can make two kinds of points with the Pen tool.
Which kind you make determines whether the line connecting the dots is
straight or curved:
✦Corner points: These points anchor straight lines.
✦Curve points: These points anchor curved lines.
If you simply click in various spots to make the shape, you automatically
make corner points. To make a freeform shape with curved lines, as shown
in Figure 3-9, do the following:
1. Select the Pen tool from the Vector section of the Tools panel.
2. Place the cursor over the canvas.
Your cursor becomes a fountain pen.
3. Click to make your starting point.
4. Move your cursor and click a second point. Keeping the mouse button
held down, move your cursor.

Book III
Chapter 3
Working with Text,
Shapes, and Images
Working with Vector Shapes
221
Point handles (solid circles at both ends of a line that has the selected
point in the middle) appear, which indicates that you have made a
curve point. As you move the mouse, Fireworks previews the curve
between the first and second point.
5. Release the mouse button to make the curve.
Fireworks joins your first and second points.
6. Move your cursor and click and drag to create as many curved lines
as you wish.
7. If you want a closed shape, click again on your starting point to close
the shape. Otherwise, double-click the end point to make an open
shape.
Editing, moving, and deleting shapes
Altering a simple shape is nearly as easy as making a simple shape. If you
make a shape using any of the tools grouped with the Rectangle, Ellipse, or
Polygon tool, Fireworks thinks of the shape as a group of points. If you want
to edit the shape, first you need to ungroup the points so you can move
them.
To change the shape of a straight-sided simple shape (that is, a shape with
nothing but corner points, like a rectangle), follow these steps:
1. Select the Subselection tool (the white arrow) from the top of the
Tools panel.
2. Click anywhere on the line defining the shape.
All the points, and the guide lines connecting them, highlight.
Figure 3-9:
Making a
complex,
curved

Working with Vector Shapes
222
3. Choose Modify➪Ungroup or use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Shift+G
to ungroup the points.
The shape remains selected.
4. Click and drag any point in the shape to the new location you want.
You can also delete a point by clicking it and pressing the Backspace or
Delete key.
If you want to edit a complex shape (like the one shown in Figure 3-9), you
can use the Subselection tool to alter any of the curves:
1. Select the Subselection tool (the white arrow) from the top of the
Tools panel.
2. Click anywhere on the line defining the shape.
All the points, and the guide lines connecting them, highlight.
3. If the shape is grouped, choose Modify➪Ungroup or press
Ctrl+Shift+G to ungroup the points.
4. Click and drag a curve point to its new location, or click a curve point
to make it active, and then click and drag one of the point handles to
change the shape of the curve.
Moving a shape is a piece of cake:
1. Select the Pointer tool (the black arrow) from the top of the Tools
panel.
2. Click anywhere on the line defining the shape and, keeping the
mouse button held down, drag the shape to your desired location.
You can also use the Subselection tool to move a shape, but you must be
careful not to click a handle. If you click and drag a point handle, you move
the point rather than the whole shape. If you change the shape by mistake,
press Ctrl+Z to undo the change.
Deleting a shape is a very simple matter indeed. To delete a shape, do the
following:
1. Select the Pointer tool (the black arrow) or the Subselection tool (the
white arrow) from the top of the Tools panel.
2. Click anywhere on the line defining the shape.
3. Press Delete key or Backspace.
If you want to cut the shape and paste it somewhere else (in your 
current document, or in a different document), use the key command

Book III
Chapter 3
Working with Text,
Shapes, and Images
Working with Vector Shapes
223
Ctrl+X to remove the shape and Ctrl+V to paste it in your desired new
location.
Splitting shapes
If you ever have occasion to split one shape into two shapes, you can call
upon the services of the Knife tool. The Knife tool is only available when
you have an ungrouped shape selected. When you don’t have an ungrouped
shape selected, the Knife tool is grayed out in the Tools panel.
To split a shape, follow these steps:
1. Select the Pointer tool (the black arrow) or Subselection tool (the
white arrow) from the top of the Tools panel.
2. Click anywhere on the line defining the shape you want to split.
All the points, and the guide lines connecting them, highlight. Just as
importantly, the Knife tool in the Vector section of the Tools panel
becomes available. (If the Knife tool remains grayed out, press
Ctrl+Shift+G to ungroup the shape and make the Knife tool available.)
3. Select the Knife tool from the Vector section of the Tools panel.
When you move your cursor over the canvas, it becomes a blade.
4. Click and drag the cursor over the guide lines where you want the
shape to split, as shown in Figure 3-10.
New points show where the cut was made. You now have two shapes. If
you want to move or edit either of the new shapes, select it with the
Subselect tool.
Figure 3-10:
Splitting a
square into
two pieces.

Working with Vector Shapes
224
If you hold down the Shift key while dragging, you can constrain the split to
45-degree angles.
Adding a little color to your shapes
You can think of your shapes as having two parts: the path that defines the
outside (which can have a stroke or not), and the inside (which can be
empty or filled). The most basic stroke for a shape is a solid color; likewise
the most basic inside for a filled shape is a solid color.
You can get pretty fancy with both strokes and fills (adding gradients, tex-
tures, and more, which we discuss in Book III, Chapter 4). However, we start
with the basics: adding solid colors to strokes and fills.
Adding color to the stroke
The default color of strokes in Fireworks is black. So when you add color to
the stroke, you’re really changing the stroke’s color from black to a color of
your choosing.
To add or change the color of your stroke, just follow these steps:
1. Select the Pointer tool (the black arrow) or Subselection tool (the
white arrow) from the Tools panel.
2. Click anywhere in the stroke.
The stroke is highlighted to show that it is selected.
3. Click the color box next to the Pencil icon in the Stroke part of the
Property inspector.
The pointer assumes the shape of an eyedropper, and the Fireworks
color picker appears. You can choose a color from the color picker,
or place the eyedropper anywhere in the Fireworks window to select
a color.
4. Click to select the color the tip of the eyedropper is over.
The stroke changes color. For a refresher on the color picker, see the
“Adding a little color” section, earlier in this chapter.
If your stroke is only 1-pixel wide, the highlight obscures the line and you
can’t see your change immediately. Don’t worry, though. Just click anywhere
on the canvas except the shape you just changed to deselect the shape so
you can see it. (You can also deselect the shape by pressing Ctrl+D.)
To remove a stroke from a path, select the stroke and choose None from the
Stroke Category pop-up menu in the Stroke part of the Property inspector.

225
Adding a fill color to the inside of the shape
Fills in Fireworks are empty by default. So when we say you add color to the
fill, that’s exactly what you’re doing! Just as with adding color to a stroke,
though, after you know how to add a color to the fill, you also know how to
change the fill’s color.
To add or change a fill color to your shape, just follow these steps:
1. Select the Pointer tool (the black arrow) or Subselection tool (the
white arrow) from the Tools panel.
2. Click anywhere in the shape.
The stroke highlights to show that the shape is selected.
3. Click the square with the red line through it (next to the Paint Bucket
icon) in the Fill part of the Property inspector.
The pointer assumes the shape of an eyedropper, and the Fireworks
color picker pops up. You can choose a color from the color picker, or
place the eyedropper anywhere in the Fireworks window to select a
color.
4. Select a color.
For a refresher on the color picker, see the “Adding a little color” sec-
tion, earlier in this chapter.
To remove an existing fill from your shape, follow the steps above, but at
Step 4, click the Transparent button (the square with the red line through it
at the top middle of the color picker).
Want to add a gradient or texture fill to your shape? See the section on
adding gradients and textures to shape fills and bitmap selections in Book
III, Chapter 4.
Working with Bitmap Images
Vector images are compact and versatile, but they don’t accommodate
the complexity of photographic images or illustrations. In a photographic
image, any given pixel might be a completely different color than any of the
pixels around it, so each pixel’s color must be defined individually. That
makes bitmaps big from a file-size perspective, but for photos on your Web
site, bitmaps are the only way to go.
Fireworks offers an array of useful tools for making and manipulating bitmap
images. You may use the bitmap tools to draw in Fireworks, but you’re likely

Working with Bitmap Images
226
to be in bitmap mode mostly when you want to place and tweak imported
images like photographs.
Exploring the bitmap drawing tools
The main bitmap drawing tools in Fireworks are the Brush and the Pencil
tools. Those tools are somewhat interchangeable and using them is as 
intuitive as can be. On the other hand, each tool has an amazing amount of
flexibility, so although you can start drawing with them quickly, it may take
some time for you to become acquainted with their full capabilities.
Most of the flexibility of the tools is centered around the concept of tips. In
the real world, the sharper a pencil, the thinner a line it draws. The thicker
the end of a paint brush is, the thicker the line it makes, and the kind of bris-
tles it has affects the texture of the line it makes. The same is true with the
tools in Fireworks.
In Fireworks, however, each tip is associated with a tool (though all those
tools are really just variations of the Pencil and Brush tools) to form a stroke
category, as the following list describes:
✦Basic: Hard Line, Hard Rounded, Soft Line, Soft Rounded
✦Air Brush: Basic, Textured
✦Calligraphy: Bamboo, Basic, Quill, Ribbon, Wet
✦Charcoal: Creamy, Pastel, Soft, Textured
✦Crayon: Basic, Rake, Thick
✦Dashed: Basic Dash, Dash Double, Dash Triple, Dotted, Hard Dash,
Heavy Dash
✦Felt Tip: Dark Marker, Highlighter, Light Marker, Thin
✦Oil: Bristle, Broad Splatter, Splatter, Strands, Textured Bristle
✦Pencil: 1-Pixel Hard, 1-Pixel Soft, Colored Pencil, Graphite
✦Watercolor: Heavy, Thick, Thin
✦Random: Confetti, Dots, Fur, Squares, Yarn
✦Unnatural: 3D, 3D Glow, Chameleon, Fluid Splatter, Outline, Paint
Splatter, Toothpaste, Toxic Waste, Viscous Alien Paint
The tips run the gamut from basic to out-of-this-world. Figure 3-11 shows
strokes made with three of the more complex tips. After you’re familiar with
the default stroke settings, you may want to customize the tips. The Edit
Stroke dialog box offers you an amazing amount of control over stroke
parameters like ink amount, flow rate, shape, and sensitivity. To open

Book III
Chapter 3
Working with Text,
Shapes, and Images
Working with Bitmap Images
227
the Edit Stroke dialog box, select Stroke Options from the Stroke Category
pop-up menu of the Property inspector, and click Advanced. See your docu-
mentation for further details.
If you have a pressure-sensitive graphics tablet, you can set your drawing
speed and pressure to modify how the stroke is placed on the canvas.
Just enter your desired settings in the Sensitivity tab of the Edit Stroke
dialog box.
To draw a line or shape using the Brush or Pencil tool, follow these steps:
1. Select the Brush or Pencil tool from the Bitmap area of the Tools
panel.
When you place your pointer over the canvas, the pointer takes the
shape of a cross hair. The default tip for the Brush tool is also the
default tip for the Pencil tool: 1-Pixel Hard.
2. Select a color from the color picker in the tool’s Property inspector.
For a refresher on the color picker, see the “Adding a little color” sec-
tion, earlier in this chapter.
3. Select a tip from the Stroke Category pop-up menu.
Each specialized tip has its own default edge size and texture.
4. Click and drag on the canvas to make your line or shape.
The wider the brush, of course, the more pronounced the effect of a
fancy tip. See Book III, Chapter 4 for more information on customizing
the brush edge and texture.

Inserting a bitmap image
Inserting an existing bitmap image into a Fireworks document is something
you’re likely to do often if you’re designing a Web page, whether the bitmaps
are pictures of your products or pictures of your family.
To insert a bitmap image into your document, you can drag and drop the
image onto the canvas from your desktop or a folder, or you can import the
image. To import a bitmap image, follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪Import or press Ctrl+R.
The Import dialog box appears.
2. Navigate to the folder containing the image you want to insert.
3. Double-click the filename, or click the filename and click OK.
The Import dialog box closes, revealing the canvas. The cursor changes
into the Insertion Pointer — a right angle.
4. Align the Insertion Pointer with the top-left point on your canvas
where you want the inserted image to go.

Fireworks allows you to select areas within an image in several different
ways. The Marquee tool, Lasso tool, and Magic Wand tool will all be
familiar to users of Photoshop. If you’re new to these tools, read on for a
brief rundown.
Using the Marquee tool
The Marquee tool has two guises, available by clicking and holding the
Marquee tool until the pop-up menu appears:
✦The Marquee tool: Use this tool to make rectangular selections.
✦The Oval Marquee tool: Use this tool to make oval-shaped selections.
To select a rectangular or oval part of your bitmap, simply follow these
steps:
1. Select the Marquee tool or the Oval Marquee tool from the Bitmap
part of the Tools panel.
When you move your pointer over the canvas, it becomes a cross.
2. Place the center of the pointer over one corner of the area you want
to select.

3. Click and drag diagonally over the area you want to select.
The selected area is delimited by a flashing marquee — the marquee is
rectangular if you selected the Marquee tool and oval if you selected the
Oval Marquee tool.
Using the Lasso tool
The Lasso tool, like the Marquee tool, has two guises, available by clicking
and holding the Lasso tool until the pop-up menu appears:
✦The Lasso tool: Use this tool to make a freeform selection area by
“drawing” the area.
✦The Polygon Lasso tool: Use this tool to select a polygonal area by
clicking points on the perimeter of the area.
To select an irregular area of your bitmap, follow these steps:
1. Select the Lasso tool from the Bitmap part of the Tools panel.
When you place your pointer over the canvas, it becomes a lasso.
2. Place the bottom tip of the pointer over the spot on the canvas where
you want your selection to start.
3. Click and drag to create an outline of the area you want to select, as
shown in Figure 3-12.
You must close the outline to make the selection. When your pointer is
over the spot where you started your selection, a little filled square
appears at the bottom right of the pointer. Click to close the
selection shape.

To select a polygonal area of your bitmap, follow these steps:
1. Select the Polygon Lasso tool from the Bitmap part of the Tools panel.
When you place your pointer over the canvas, it becomes a lasso.
2. Place the bottom tip of the pointer over the spot on the canvas where
you want your selection to start.
3. Click to establish the first point of the area you want to select.
4. Move your cursor to the second point of the area you want to select
and click.
Fireworks connects the points with a straight line.
5. Place your cursor and click on all points making up the polygonal
selection.
You must close the outline to make the selection. Double-click to close
the selection from the last-placed point to the first-placed point. Or,
when your pointer is over the first-placed point (a little filled square
appears at the bottom right of the pointer), click to close the selection
shape.
Using the Magic Wand
The third bitmap selection tool is known as the Magic Wand tool. The Magic
Wand tool selects an area of solid color or of similar colors. (You can set the
wand’s sensitivity level so it selects areas of more similar or less similar
colors.)
To select a contiguous area of similar color in your bitmap, follow these
steps:
1. Select the Magic Wand tool from the Bitmap section of the Tools
panel.
When you place your pointer over the canvas, it takes the form of a
magician’s wand.
2. Place the pointer over the part of the image you want to select, and
click.
A blinking marquee marks off the selected area. If too much area is
selected, you need to make the wand more sensitive. Set the Tolerance
level in the Property inspector to a lower number. If not enough area is
selected, set the Tolerance level to a higher number (up to 255, at which
setting you will probably select your entire bitmap).

Editing bitmaps: The basics
Fireworks allows you to manipulate bitmaps in all kinds of crazy and inter-
esting ways, but naturally, it also allows you to do common everyday image-
altering as well.
Perhaps the most basic bitmap editing tasks you can do are cropping, resiz-
ing, rotating, and distorting an image, which we cover in Book III, Chapter 4,
along with basic filtering operations, like Blurring, Sharpening, and making
color adjustments.
No introductory chapter on bitmap editing would be complete, though,
without a quick look at the Eraser tool. As you may expect, the Eraser tool is
the anti-brush. While the Brush tool adds a line or shape or pattern to a
bitmap, the Eraser tool removes a line of pixels from a bitmap.
To erase pixels from your bitmap, follow these steps:
1. Select the Eraser tool from the Bitmap part of the Tools panel.
The Eraser tool defaults to a circle, though you can set it to be square-
shaped in the Property inspector.
2. In the Property inspector, type a size, or use the handy slider to set
the width of the Eraser.
The range goes from 1 to 100.
3. Select the circle shape or square shape by clicking on one or the
other.
4. Set the Edge by typing a number or using the slider.
The range goes from 0 to 100. Setting to zero gives a hard edge to your
Eraser (a pixel is removed or not), while setting to 100 gives a fuzzy
edge to the erased area.
5. Set the Opacity of the Eraser by typing a number or using the slider.
The range goes from 1 to 100 percent. If you set the Opacity to 100 per-
cent, the Eraser clears all the erased pixels entirely (except at the
edges, if you have an edge of greater than 0 set). If you set the opacity
to less than 100 percent, the Eraser creates a translucent effect, allow-
ing whatever is under the bitmap to show through. The lower the opac-
ity setting, the more the image underneath shows through.
6. Click and drag on your image with the Eraser tool to rub out those
unwanted pixels.
The pixels disappear as you drag the cursor over them.

I
n the course of laying out the pages of your Web site, you may want to
change the size or color of an image so that it fits more naturally into
your design. In this chapter, we show you how to manipulate images, or
parts of images, to create effects from subtle to extreme.
Scaling Graphics
When we talk about scaling graphics, we’re talking about changing the size
of a bitmap or vector shape on the canvas, not changing the size of your
overall image (that is, everything on the whole of your canvas). To find out
how to change the canvas size, see Book III, Chapter 2. You can change the
size of an image element or selected part of an image element in two ways:
✦Use the Scale Transformation tool: Click and drag the image object or
selection. Employ this option if you want to figure out the proper size of
the image by eyeballing it.
✦Change the numbers in the Property inspector: Type numbers in the
width and height boxes. Use this option if you have exact dimensions in
mind for your image.
Both methods are fairly simple, and their results are identical (that is,
whether you drag an object to a specific width or type that width into the
Property inspector, the resized object will look the same).

Scaling Graphics
234
Using the Scale Transformation tool
You can change the size of an object, either retaining its proportions or dis-
torting it, by using the Scale tool. To change the size of an object by using
the click-and-drag method, follow these instructions:
1. Click the Pointer tool or Subselection tool from the Select section of
the Tools panel, and then click the object you want to resize.
For more information on selecting image objects or parts of image
objects, see Book III, Chapter 3.
2. Select the Scale tool — it looks a bit like a baseball diamond —
from the Select section of the Tools panel or choose Modify➪
Transform➪Scale.
A box with eight handles and a center point overlays the selected
object.
3. Click and drag one of the handles to scale the object as follows:
• To scale the object while retaining its proportions: Click one of
the corner handles (make sure the cursor looks like a double-sided
arrow) and drag the object to the desired size.
• To scale the object and distort its proportions: Click and drag the
middle handle on either the left or right side of the box around the
object (make sure the cursor looks like a double-sided arrow) to
change the object’s width; or click and drag the center handle on
either the top or bottom of the box around the object (make sure
the cursor looks like a double-sided arrow) to change the object’s
height.
By default, Fireworks continues to display the original box around
the object, but it adds a version of the box with a dotted line to
show the new dimensions as you drag, as shown in Figure 4-1.
When the cursor looks like a three-quarter circle with an arrow, you
can rotate the image instead of resizing it. See the “Rotating graph-
ics” section, later in this chapter, for details on rotating images.
4. Release the mouse button.
Fireworks redraws the image to your selected size.
5. Click and drag to reposition the image, if necessary.
The cursor changes into a four-pointed arrow when you place it over
the redrawn image, which indicates that you can move the image. (See
Figure 4-2.) You can remove the transform handles by double-clicking
the image, which will also change the tool to the Pointer tool.

Resizing by entering numerical values
Sometimes you have a space with a defined width and height into which you
want to place images of that exact width and height. If the images are not
already sized to fit that space and you have calculated the exact proportions
or you aren’t worried about distorting the images, use the following method
to resize the images.

To change the width and/or height of an image by typing in a new value for
the width and/or the height, just follow these steps:
1. Using the Pointer tool or Subselection tool, click the object you want
to resize.
See Book III, Chapter 3 for more information on selecting image objects
or parts of image objects.
2. In the Property inspector, double-click or highlight the number in the
Width field, as shown in Figure 4-3, and type in a new number.
If you cannot see the Width and Height fields, your Property inspector
may be collapsed. To expand the panel, click once on the downward-
pointing arrow at the bottom-right corner of the panel. If the Property
inspector is not visible on-screen, press Ctrl+F3 to open it.
3. If you are not going to change the height, press Enter to implement
the width change.
Fireworks redraws the selection at the new width.
4. If you are going to change the height, select the number in the Height
field and type a new value.
5. Press Enter or click in another value field.
Fireworks updates the height of the selection.
Distorting and Skewing Images and Text
Changing the width but not the height of an image object, or changing the
object’s height but not the width, distorts the object along one axis. What if
you want to stretch one corner of an object but leave the rest of the object
more or less intact, or perform some other unusual stretching or shrinking?
The Distort and Skew tools are at your disposal — they’re just hiding behind
the Scale tool. To access the Distort and Skew tools, click and hold the Scale
tool in the Select section of the Tools panel and select one of the tools from
Figure 4-3:

the menu that pops up, or select the Scale tool and press Q on your keyboard
until the tool you want appears.
What’s the difference between skewing and distorting? Skewing is actually a
particular kind of distortion:
✦Distorting: Stretching or shrinking one or more sides of an image
object.
✦Skewing: Distorting an image object by stretching or shrinking two of
its four sides while leaving the other two the same, or stretching or
shrinking three of the four sides of the object’s bounding box at once
but not changing the dimensions of the fourth side. Skewing can create
the illusion of perspective.
The Distort tool is far more versatile than the Skew tool:
✦You can use the Distort tool to resize along one axis, in which case you
are scaling the object.
✦You can use the Distort tool to stretch or shrink three sides of an object
at once, in which case you are skewing the object.
✦You can use the Distort tool to create more complex forms of image
manipulation by both scaling and skewing the object, for example.
Distorting an image
To distort an object by using the Distort tool, follow these steps:
1. Click the Pointer tool or Subselection tool in the Tools panel, and
then click the object you want to distort.
2. Select the Distort tool from the Tools panel or choose Modify➪
Transform➪Distort.
If you are selecting from the Tools panel, click and hold on the Scale
tool in the Select section of the Tools panel and select the Distort tool
from the pop-up menu. A box with eight handles and a center point
overlays the selected object.
3. Click and drag any handle.
By default, Fireworks continues to display the original box around the
object, but it adds a version of the box with a dotted line to show the
new dimensions as you drag, as shown in Figure 4-4. The cursor becomes
a double-sided arrow as you place it over a center or middle handle.
Note that when you try to drag handles too far (that is, if you try to drag
a middle left handle above the top left handle, for example), the dotted

Distorting and Skewing Images and Text
238
line will stretch to wherever you drag the handle, but when you release
the mouse button, the image snaps to the farthest allowable point in the
direction you dragged. In short, a handle may not cross other handles.
4. Click and drag any other handles.
You can stretch and squash the image by dragging as many handles as
many times as you want.
5. Press Enter or double-click anywhere on the canvas.
Fireworks updates the selection.
Skewing an image
To skew an image, follow these simple steps:
1. With the Pointer tool or Subselection tool, click the object you want
to skew.
2. Select the Skew tool from the Tools panel or choose Modify➪
Transform➪Skew.
If you are selecting from the Tools panel, click and hold on the Scale
tool in the Select section of the Tools panel and select the Skew tool
when the pop-up menu displays the Skew and Distort tools. A box with
eight handles and a center point overlays the selected object.
3. Click and drag any handle:
• The center handles on the top and bottom can skew a side of the
image left or right.
• The middle handles on the left and right can skew a side of the
image up or down.

• The corner handles behave differently, depending on if you drag
them along the left-right axis or along the up-down axis, but no
matter which axis you drag along, they spread the selected side of
the image along that axis. For example, if you select the top-left
corner and drag up, the bottom-left corner stretches down 
proportionally.
By default, Fireworks continues to display the original box around the
object, but it adds a version of the box with a dotted line to show the
new dimensions as you drag, as shown in Figure 4-4. The cursor becomes
a double-sided arrow as you place it over a center or middle handle. The
arrow indicates in which directions you can drag the handle.
4. Press Enter or double-click anywhere on the canvas.
Fireworks updates the selection, the transformation handles disappear,
and the tool reverts to the Pointer tool.
Distorting and skewing text
In Fireworks, distorting text is as easy as distorting images. To distort the
text in a text box, while leaving the text editable, just follow these steps:
1. Click the Pointer tool or Subselection tool in the Tools panel, and
then click the text box you want to distort.
You can also select the text box using the Text tool, but you cannot 
distort only part of the text in a text box. You can, however, Shift+click
two text boxes and distort them together.
2. Select the Distort tool from the Tools panel or choose Modify➪
Transform➪Distort.
If you are selecting from the Tools panel, click and hold on the Scale
tool in the Tools panel and select the Distort tool from the pop-up
menu. A box with eight handles and a center point overlays the
selected text box.
3. Click and drag any handle.
By default, Fireworks continues to display the original box around the
object, but it adds a version of the box with a dotted line to show the
new dimensions as you drag. The cursor becomes a double-sided arrow
as you place it over a center or middle handle.
Note that when you try to drag handles too far (that is, if you try to
drag a middle right handle above the top right handle, for example), the
dotted line will stretch to wherever you drag the handle, but when you
release the mouse button, the image snaps to the farthest allowable
point in the direction you dragged. In short, a handle may not cross
other handles.

4. Click and drag any other handles.
You can stretch and squash and drag as many handles as many times as
you want.
5. Press Enter or double-click anywhere on the canvas.
Fireworks updates the selection, as shown in Figure 4-5.
To skew a text box, follow these simple steps:
1. Using the Pointer tool or Subselection tool in the Tools panel, click
the text box.
You can also select the text box using the Text tool, but you cannot 
distort only a part of the text in a text box.
2. Select the Skew tool from the Tools panel or choose Modify➪
Transform➪Skew.
If you are selecting from the Tools panel, click and hold on the Scale
tool in the Tools panel and select the Skew tool when the pop-up menu
displays the Skew and Distort tools. A box with eight handles and a
center point overlays the selected text box.
3. Click and drag any handle.
By default, Fireworks continues to display the original box around the
object, but it adds a version of the box with a dotted line to show the
new dimensions as you drag. The cursor becomes a double-sided arrow
as you place it over a center or middle handle. The arrow indicates in
which directions you can drag the handle.

The center handles on the top and bottom can skew a side of the image
left or right. The middle handles on the left and right can skew a side of
the image up or down.
The corner handles behave differently, depending on if you drag them
along the left-right axis or along the up-down axis, but no matter which
axis you drag along, they spread the selected side of the image along
that axis. For example, if you select the top-left corner and drag up, the
bottom-left corner will stretch down proportionally.
4. Press Enter or double-click anywhere on the canvas.
Fireworks updates the selection, the transformation handles disappear,
and the tool reverts to the Pointer tool.
Rotating and Flipping Graphics and Text
As is the case with resizing, Fireworks allows you to rotate and flip every-
thing on the canvas at once, but it also allows you to select individual
graphic elements (image objects) and rotate or flip them independently.
Rotating graphics
You can rotate a graphic in two ways:
✦Rotate a preset amount: Fireworks offers a quick way to rotate a
graphic either 90 or 180 degrees around its center point.
✦Rotate any amount: You can click and drag to rotate an image around
its center point, or even move the point and rotate the image around a
point not at the image’s center.
To rotate a graphic by 90-degree increments, follow these steps:
1. Select the object by using the Pointer tool or Subselection tool.
For more information on selecting image objects or parts of image
objects, see Book III, Chapter 3.
2. Choose how you want to rotate the object:
• To rotate the object 180 degrees (turning it upside down): Choose
Modify➪Transform➪Rotate 180 Degrees.
• To rotate a graphic 90 degrees clockwise (to turn it sideways to
the right): Choose Modify➪Transform➪Rotate 90 Degrees CW, or
use the key command Ctrl+Shift+9.

Rotating and Flipping Graphics and Text
242
• To rotate a graphic 90 degrees counter-clockwise (to turn it side-
ways to the left): Choose Modify➪Transform➪Rotate 90 Degrees
CCW, or use the key command Ctrl+Shift+7.
Rotating an object freehand requires a couple of extra steps, but it gives you
much finer control over the degree of rotation. To rotate an object any
amount about its center axis, just follow these steps:
1. Select the object by using the Pointer tool or Subselection tool.
2. Choose Modify➪Transform➪Free Transform (or Scale, Skew, or
Distort).
You can also use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+T to access the Free
Transform command.
3. Place your cursor over the canvas.
The cursor changes into a rounded arrow, as shown in Figure 4-6.
4. Click and drag the cursor in any direction.
If you drag down or to the right, the image rotates clockwise; if you drag
up or to the left, the image rotates counter-clockwise.
If you hold down the Shift key while rotating your graphic, you restrict
the angle of the rotation to 15-degree increments.
5. Press Enter or double-click anywhere on the canvas.
Fireworks updates the selection, the transformation handles disappear,
and the tool reverts to the Pointer tool.

Rotating text
In Fireworks, rotating text is pretty much like rotating a graphic. To rotate a
text box in 90-degree increments, follow these steps:
1. Click the Pointer tool or Subselection tool in the Tools panel, and
then click the text box.
You can also select the text box using the Text tool, but you cannot 
distort only a part of a text box.
2. Choose how you want to rotate the text as follows:
• To rotate the text box by 180 degrees (turning it upside down):
Choose Modify➪Transform➪Rotate 180 Degrees.
• To rotate a text box 90 degrees clockwise (to turn it sideways to
the right): Choose Modify➪Transform➪Rotate 90 Degrees CW, or
use the key command Ctrl+Shift+9.
• To rotate a text box 90 degrees counter-clockwise (to turn it side-
ways to the left): Choose Modify➪Transform➪Rotate 90 Degrees
CCW, or use the key command Ctrl+Shift+7.
To rotate text freehand, follow these simple steps:
1. Use the Pointer tool or Subselection tool to select the text box you
want to rotate.
You can only distort the entire text box.
2. Choose Modify➪Transform➪Free Transform (or Scale, Skew, or
Distort).
You can also use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+T to access the Free
Transform command.
3. Place your cursor over the canvas.
The cursor changes into a rounded arrow.
4. Click and drag the cursor in any direction.
If you drag down or to the right, the text box rotates clockwise; if you
drag up or to the left, the image rotates counter-clockwise.
5. Press Enter or double-click anywhere on the canvas.
Fireworks updates the selection, the transformation handles disappear,
and the tool reverts to the Pointer tool.
Flipping images
Fireworks allows you to flip images vertically and horizontally. Both manipu-
lations are a snap.

244
To flip an image horizontally (making it a mirror image of what it was origi-
nally) or vertically (turning it upside down), follow these steps:
1. Select the object you want to flip.
2. Choose Modify➪Transform➪Flip Horizontal to make a mirror image
of the object; choose Modify➪Transform➪Flip Vertical to turn the
object upside down.
Depending on which choice you make, your selection either flips hori-
zontally, as shown in Figure 4-7, or vertically, as shown in Figure 4-8.

Flipping text
Fireworks allows you to flip text boxes vertically and horizontally. Both
manipulations are a piece of cake.
Follow these steps to flip a text box horizontally (making it a mirror image of
what it was originally) or vertically (turning it upside down):
1. Select the text box you want to flip with the Pointer tool or
Subselection tool.
You can also select the text box using the Text tool, but you cannot 
distort only a part of a text box.
2. Choose Modify➪Transform➪Flip Horizontal to make a mirror image
of the text box; choose Modify➪Transform➪Flip Vertical to turn the
text upside down.
Your selection flips horizontally or vertically.
Adding Gradients and Textures to Shape 
Fills and Bitmap Selections
In Book III, Chapter 3, we show you how to fill a vector shape with a color. In
this section, you find out how to treat your shape to a fancier filling: a gradi-
ent and/or a texture. Gradients and textures can add the illusion of depth to
your images. They also increase the file size of your images because they
are difficult to compress, so use them sparingly.
Introducing gradients
A gradient is a subtle blend of one color into another. A classic example of a
gradient in nature is a sky at sunset (or sunrise, if you ever wake up that
early). Near the horizon, the sky is a deep, bright orange; straight up, the
sky is a dark blue. In between those two colors is a bunch of transitions:
from bright orange to pale orange to pale blue to dark blue. The transitions
are so subtle, it’s difficult to say where one color leaves off and another
begins. That’s a gradient.
Fireworks ships with a wonderful array of useful gradient patterns, which
you can access via a pop-up menu in the Property inspector:
✦Linear
✦Starburst
✦Radial
✦Folds
✦Rectangle
✦Ellipse

Adding Gradients and Textures to Shape Fills and Bitmap Selections
246
✦Cone
✦Bars
✦Contour
✦Ripples
✦Satin
✦Waves
While the black-and-white of this printed page may not quite do these gradi-
ents justice compared to what they look like in full color, you can still get a
pretty good idea of the variety of the gradients, as shown in Figure 4-9.
You can choose any colors to make your gradients, but Fireworks also has
the following handy preset gradient options:
✦Black, White
✦Red, Blue
✦Blue, Red, Yellow
✦Red, Green, Blue
✦Blue, Yellow, Blue
✦Silver
✦Cobalt Blue
✦Spectrum
✦Copper
✦Violet, Orange
✦Emerald Green
✦White, Black
✦Pastels
To add a preset gradient fill to a vector shape, follow these steps:
1. Select the Pointer tool or Subselection tool and click the shape.

2. Click and hold the Fill Categories box next to the Paint Bucket icon in
the Property inspector.
3. Choose Gradient, and select a gradient type from the menu, as shown
in Figure 4-10.
The default colors for gradients are black and white. If those are the
colors you want for your gradient, congratulations! You’re done! If not,
continue with the next step.
4. Click the Fill Color box next to the Paint Bucket icon in the Property
inspector.
A pop-up window, as shown in Figure 4-11, appears:
• At the bottom is a preview pane, which shows what the gradient pat-
tern will look like when applied to the shape. (The selected pattern
in Figure 4-11 is Cone.)
• In the middle of the window lies the Preset drop-down list, from
which you can choose preset colors for your gradient.
• At the top of the window is a simpler preview strip that shows color
but not pattern information. Above and below that strip are sliders.
The sliders above give you control over the opacity of each color in
the gradient; the sliders below give you control over the amount of
each color in the gradient.

5. Select preset colors for your gradient from the Preset drop-down list.
The preview panes and the selected shape update.
Notice that different presets have different numbers, or instances, of
colors. The Cobalt Blue preset, for example, creates its opalescent glow
with two instances each of three colors.
6. Click anywhere outside the pop-up window to make it disappear.
To add a user-defined gradient fill to a vector shape requires a number of
steps, but it can be as simple or complex a process as you wish. Just follow
these steps:
1. Select the Pointer tool or Subselection tool and click the shape.
2. Click and hold the Fill Categories box next to the Paint Bucket icon in
the Property inspector.
3. Select a gradient type from the pop-up menu (refer to Figure 4-10).
The default colors for gradients are black and white.
4. Click the Fill Color box next to the Paint Bucket icon in the Property
inspector.
A pop-up window appears (refer to Figure 4-11).
5. Click the left color slider, as shown in Figure 4-12.
When you place the cursor over a slider, it becomes a solid black arrow
with no stem. When you click and release the slider, the familiar color
picker pops up. If you need a refresher on the color picker, see Book III,
Chapter 3.

6. Select a color from the color picker.
Your cursor is an eyedropper in the color picker.
7. If you want more than two colors in your gradient, click anywhere
between the two default color sliders. If not, skip to Step 12.
Note that your cursor becomes an arrow with a small plus sign (+) when
you move it between the existing color sliders. After you click, a new
slider appears, and your cursor becomes a solid black arrow with no
stem until you move it off the new slider.
By default, the color of the new slider is the color in the strip directly
above where you clicked.
8. If you want to change the color of the new slider, click it and release.
When you click and release, the familiar color picker pops up.
9. Select a color using the eyedropper.
10. If desired, move the new color slider left or right to change where the
new color blends with the other colors.
11. If you want more than three colors in your gradient, repeat Steps 7
through 10.
12. Click the right color slider.
13. Select a color using the eyedropper.
14. If you want to, move any of the sliders horizontally to adjust where
their respective colors fall in the gradient.
15. If desired, adjust the opacity of the entire gradient or vary the opacity
of different parts of the gradient.
By default, the opacity of both ends is set to 100 percent (no back-
ground shows through). You can add and adjust opacity sliders just as
you can color sliders, and they work in more or less the same way.

When you click an opacity slider, a pop-up window displays a slider that
goes from 0 percent at the left (no gradient shows in front of the back-
ground) to 100 percent at the right.
16. Click anywhere outside the pop-up window to make it disappear.
After you’ve added a gradient fill to your shape, you can rotate, skew, move,
and change the width of the gradient. See your documentation for details.
To remove a color slider or opacity slider (you must have at least two colors
to make a gradient, of course), click and drag it up out of the gradient pop-
up window. When you release the mouse button, the slider will be gone, and
you’ll have a less complex gradient fill.
Follow these steps to add a gradient fill to a bitmap selection:
1. Select the part of the bitmap image you want to fill with a Tool from
the Bitmap section of the Tools panel.
In most cases, the Magic Wand tool is the best candidate for this job.
For more information on selecting parts of image objects, see Book III,
Chapter 3.
2. Click the Color box next to the Paint Bucket icon in the Colors section
of the Tools panel.
The color picker appears.
3. Click the Fill Options button at the bottom of the color picker.
A new pop-up window appears in place of the color picker.
4. Select a gradient pattern from the drop-down list.
5. Follow Steps 4 through 6 in the steps that describe adding a preset
gradient fill to a vector shape or Steps 4 through 6 in the steps that
describe adding a user-defined gradient fill to a vector shape.
6. Click the Paint Bucket tool, and then click anywhere in the selected
area to apply the gradient fill.
Adding textures
Adding textures to your fills and bitmap selections is even easier than
adding gradients. You can even have fills with both a gradient and a texture,
though we find that combining gradients and textures often diminishes the
graphic power of both in a given image.
To add a texture to a vector shape, follow these steps:
1. Select the Pointer tool or Subselection tool and click the shape.

Book III
Chapter 4
Transforming Text,
Shapes, and Images
Adjusting Color Information and More with Filters
251
If the shape is transparent, you’ll need to add a color or gradient fill. If
the shape has a transparent fill (no fill), the Texture list box will be 
inactive.
2. Click and hold the arrow in the Texture drop-down list — you’ll find
it under the Edge drop-down list in the Property inspector.
3. Select a texture from the drop-down list.
The drop-down list displays the built-in textures — if you have addi-
tional textures, select Other from the list and browse to the texture you
want to use.
When you release the mouse button, the texture is applied to the shape
fill with the default opacity of 50%.
4. Type a value or drag the slider in the Amount of Texture field (next to
the Texture drop-down list) to set the opacity of the texture.
A setting of 0 does not show any of the texture, and a setting of 100
shows the texture at full (100 percent) opacity.
Adjusting Color Information and More with Filters
Fireworks has plenty of useful presets and defaults for the novice user, and
enough tweakability to satisfy most any professional. Pros will especially
appreciate the amount of control Fireworks gives users in the area of color
adjustment.
You can accomplish many of the effects described in this section in two
basic ways:
✦Using Live Effects: This is a bit like making everything you look at
appear yellow by putting on a pair of sunglasses. You’re not changing
the colors of whatever you’re looking at, you’re putting something
between you and the object to change the appearance of the object.
Live effects can be turned off and on without changing the pixels that
make up the object to which the effects are applied. If the object in your
Web page design is something that may change later or be repurposed
elsewhere, perhaps with different effects applied, you can use Live
Effects to apply non-destructive changes to the object in a particular
PNG file. Live Effects can be applied only to whole objects.
✦Using Filters: This method is considered destructive, because it alters
the pixels in the bitmap. This is like making everything you see yellow
by painting everything yellow. Though the process is destructive, it is
not permanent — as long as you have the Undo command available.

Adjusting Color Information and More with Filters
252
We show you how to use the Filters method in the following three sections.
For more about Live Effects, see Book III, Chapter 7.
Fine-tuning your colors
We touch briefly on the color adjustment tools at the end of Book III,
Chapter 3, but here we go into a bit more detail. The color adjustment 
controls available from the Filters menu are as follows:
✦Auto Levels: In theory, an optimal image has an even distribution of
dark tones, medium tones, and light tones. Auto Levels sets levels 
automatically so that shadows, midtones, and highlights are evenly 
distributed in your image.
✦Brightness/Contrast: Controls the overall luminosity of a selection and
the contrast of color shades within a selection.
✦Curves: Offers a way to modify very specific colors without affecting
others.
✦Hue/Saturation: Controls the tones and intensities of colors within a
selection.
✦Invert: Allows you to reverse the colors in a selection to make some-
thing analogous to a photographic negative.
✦Levels: Like curves, levels allows you to modify colors, but it does so by
letting you adjust shadows, midtones, and highlights of one of the three
individual color channels (red, green, or blue) or all channels together.
To change the brightness or contrast of a graphic or selection, just follow
these steps:
1. Select a graphic or part of a graphic.
For more information on selecting image objects or parts of image
objects, see Book III, Chapter 3.
2. Choose Filters➪Adjust Color➪Brightness/Contrast.
A dialog box with separate sliders for brightness and contrast appears.
3. If you wish to lighten or darken your selection, click and drag the
Brightness slider.
The default position is at the center. You can drag left down to –100
units to darken the selection, or you can drag right up to 100 units to
lighten the selection. If the Preview check box is selected, as it is by
default, you can see the change to your selection when you release the
mouse button.

4. If you want to alter the relationship between the dark and light pixels
in your selection, click and drag the Contrast slider.
The default position is at the center. You can drag left down to –100
units to reduce the contrast in the selection, or you can drag right up to
100 units to increase the contrast in the selection. If the Preview check
box is selected, as it is by default, you can see the change to your selec-
tion when you release the mouse button.
5. Click OK.
All colors on a computer monitor are formed from the combination of the
three color channels, red, green, and blue. You can change the curves for
the individual color channels or for the combination of all channels. Curve
adjustments can be made for bitmaps only, not shapes. If you want to adjust
the color of a vector shape using curve values, convert it to a bitmap first
(select the object and choose Flatten Selection from the Options menu in
the Layers panel). To change the curve of the RGB channels, follow these
steps:
1. Select a graphic or part of a graphic.
For more information on selecting image objects or parts of image
objects, see Book III, Chapter 3.
2. Choose Filters➪Adjust Color➪Curves.
A dialog box with a grid appears, as shown in Figure 4-13. The grid’s hor-
izontal axis shows the original brightness of the pixels in your selection.
The grid’s vertical axis shows the new brightness of the pixels.
3. Choose a channel from the Channel drop-down list.
Your choices are RGB (all channels), Red, Green, or Blue.
Figure 4-13:
The default
setting in
the Curves
dialog box is
a diagonal
line.

Adjusting Color Information and More with Filters
254
4. Click anywhere along the line in the grid and drag to adjust the
curve.
When you click on the line, Fireworks generates a handle automatically.
The end points always remain where they are, but you can add handles
anywhere else on the line and drag them to new points. You can delete
handles by dragging them up out of the dialog box. You can type a
numerical value into the Input and Output text fields instead of dragging
the line, if you prefer.
If the Preview check box is selected, as it is by default, you can see the
changes when you release the mouse button after dragging a handle.
Clicking the Auto button restores the line to its original setting.
5. Click OK.
Follow these steps to change the hue, saturation, and/or lightness of a
graphic or selection:
1. Select a graphic or part of a graphic.
For more information on selecting image objects or parts of image
objects, see Book III, Chapter 3.
2. Choose Filters➪Adjust Color➪Hue/Saturation.
A dialog box with separate sliders for Hue, Saturation, and Lightness
pops up.
3. If you want to change the basic color of your selection, click and drag
the Hue slider.
The default position is at the center. You can drag left down to –180
degrees, or you can drag right up to 180 degrees. (You can think of the
slider as a flattened circle, like a map of the Earth is a flattened globe.) 
If the Preview check box is selected, as it is by default, you can see the
change to your selection when you release the mouse button.
4. If you want to alter the intensity of the colors in your selection, click
and drag the Saturation slider.
The default position is at the center. You can drag left down to –100
units to reduce the color saturation in the selection, or you can drag
right up to 100 units to increase the color saturation in the selection. If
the Preview check box is selected, as it is by default, you can see the
change to your selection when you release the mouse button.
5. If you want to alter the luminosity of the colors in your selection,
click and drag the Lightness slider.

Book III
Chapter 4
Transforming Text,

255
The default position is at the center. You can drag left down to –100
units to reduce the lightness of the selection, or you can drag right up
to 100 units to increase the lightness of the selection. A setting of –100
gives you black, and a setting of 100 gives you white. If the Preview
check box is selected, as it is by default, you can see the change to your
selection when you release the mouse button.
6. Click OK.
If you want to change the hue and/or saturation of black or white pixels,
select the Colorize check box, and then make your adjustments.
To invert the colors of a graphic or any selection, follow these steps:
1. Select a graphic or part of a graphic.
2. Choose Filters➪Adjust Color➪Invert, or use the key command
Ctrl+Alt+Shift+I.
The colors of your selection are inverted, as in a photographic negative.
The Levels command allows you to make color corrections to an image or
selection by altering the balance of highlights, midtones, and shadows. The
graphical representation of the distribution of shades is called a histogram.
To adjust the levels of an image or image selection, follow these steps:
1. Select a graphic or part of a graphic.
For more information on selecting image objects or parts of image
objects, see Book III, Chapter 3.
2. Choose Filters➪Adjust Color➪Levels.
The Levels dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 4-14.
Figure 4-14:

256
3. Choose a channel from the Channel drop-down list.
Your choices are RGB (all channels), Red, Green, or Blue.
4. Click and drag the Input shadows slider (the black triangle at the left
under the histogram) as needed.
Note that the shadows slider cannot be dragged farther right than the
midtones slider, because shadows must always be darker than mid-
tones. The slider scale goes from 0 (no brightness, which is black) to
255 (full brightness, which is white). The midtones slider moves auto-
matically when you move the shadows slider.
5. Click and drag the Input midtones slider (the gray triangle in the
middle under the histogram) as needed.
The midtones slider cannot be dragged farther left than the shadows
slider nor farther right than the highlights slider. The midtones slider’s
scale goes from 0 to 10.
Dragging the midtones slider to the right generally darkens the selec-
tion, and dragging it to the far left can create something resembling a
posterization effect, in which transitions between colors are abrupt
rather than smooth.
6. Click and drag the Input highlights slider (the white triangle at the
right under the histogram) as needed.
The highlights slider cannot be dragged farther left than the midtone
slider, because highlights must be lighter than midtones.
7. Click and drag the Output shadows and highlights sliders as needed.
These sliders can be moved past each other. Moving the darkness slider
all the way to the right and the lightness slider all the way to the left
inverts the colors in the selection.
8. Click OK.
If you click Cancel, your adjustments will not be implemented. If you
click the Auto button, Fireworks sets the optimal color balance 
automatically.
To let Fireworks set the optimal levels automatically, you can click the Auto
button in the Curves and Levels dialog boxes, or you can select a graphic or
part of a graphic, and then choose Filters➪Adjust Color➪Auto Levels.
Blurring and sharpening
Blurring a graphic or selection can add a sense of softness to an image;
sharpening, on the other hand, can add a sense of solidity or hyper-reality

257
to an image. Note: The Sharpen command cannot correct a blatantly out-of-
focus photo; nothing can.
To blur an image or part of an image using Fireworks presets, simply follow
these steps:
1. Select a graphic or part of a graphic.
For more information on selecting image objects or parts of image
objects, see Book III, Chapter 3.
2. Choose Filters➪Blur➪Blur.
For a more pronounced effect, choose Filters➪Blur➪Blur More.
3. Click OK.
You can also use the Blur tool from the Bitmap section of the Tools panel to
“paint” a blur across your image. If you want to blur multiple small parts of
an image, you may find the Blur tool more effective.
If you want more control over the amount of blur of your image, you can
employ the Gaussian Blur filter by following these steps:
1. Select a graphic or part of a graphic.
2. Choose Filters➪Blur➪Gaussian Blur.
The Gaussian Blur dialog box appears.
3. Click and drag the slider to set the radius of the blur.
The radius can be set from 0.1 (hardly noticeable blur) to 250.0 (near
total blur).
4. Click OK.
To sharpen an image or selection using Fireworks presets, just follow these
steps:
1. Select a graphic or part of a graphic.
2. Choose Filters➪Sharpen➪Sharpen.
For a more pronounced effect, choose Filters➪Sharpen➪Sharpen More.
3. Click OK.
If you want more control over the amount and manner of the sharpening,
you can use the Unsharp Mask filter. This filter works by strengthening the
contrast between adjacent pixels, which makes for more sharply defined
edges between areas of color. Actually, that’s the way all the Sharpen filters

Adjusting Color Information and More with Filters
258
work, but with Unsharp Mask, you can create your own settings for three
aspects of the sharpening process:
✦Sharpen Amount: This is the amount of contrast introduced between
adjacent pixels.
✦Pixel Radius: This is the size of the area around each pixel that gets
sharpened.
✦Threshold: This setting determines which pixels get sharpened based
on the existing contrast levels in the selection or image.
Follow these steps to sharpen an image or selection using the Unsharp
Mask filter:
1. Select a graphic or part of a graphic.
For more information on selecting image objects or parts of image
objects, see Book III, Chapter 3.
2. Choose Filters➪Sharpen➪Unsharp Mask.
The Unsharp Mask dialog box pops up.
3. Click and drag the Sharpen Amount slider.
The slider goes from 1 percent (not very much) to 500 percent (very
strong contrast).
4. Click and drag the Pixel Radius slider.
The slider goes from 0.1 (hardly noticeable) to 250.0 (very strong
effect).
5. Click and drag the Threshold slider.
The slider goes from 0 (change all pixels) to 255 (change no pixels).
6. Click OK.
Using the other filters: Convert 
to Alpha and Find Edges
The Convert to Alpha filter makes your selection transparent. The lighter
the pixel, the more transparent it becomes. White pixels, for example, seem
to disappear, allowing the background to show through fully. Black pixels,
on the other hand, remain black and completely opaque.
To convert a selection to Alpha, follow these simple steps:
1. Select a graphic or part of a graphic.
2. Choose Filters➪Other➪Convert to Alpha.
The selection is converted.

The Find Edges filter makes a photograph look like a line drawing by greatly
simplifying the color information in the image.
To use the Find Edges filter, just follow these steps:
1. Select a graphic or part of a graphic.
For more information on selecting image objects or parts of image
objects, see Book III, Chapter 3.

Using Extras: Lite Versions Bundled 
with Fireworks MX 2004
Fireworks allows you to use third-party filters as plug-ins, as demonstrated
by the included “lite” versions of Alien Skin’s Eye Candy 4000 (Bevel Boss,
Marble, and Motion Trail) and Splat (Edges). These versions of the third-
party software are not full-featured (hence the “lite” appellation), though
grayed-out menu options give you a sense of what the full-featured version
of the software can do.
Because these lite versions are not officially part of Fireworks, we do not
cover them in this book. You can find information about the fully-functioning
versions of these filters at www.alienskin.com.

E
verything you put on your canvas in Fireworks MX 2004 — everything
you draw or type or paste or import — exists in a layer. In turn, every
layer exists in a frame. Initially this seems simple enough, but it is more
involved than it first appears. Layers can be shared by frames, and a single
layer can contain a single object (a bitmap, shape, or text) or multiple
objects. Things can actually get pretty complex in a large file, where you
can have dozens of bitmaps, shapes, and text blocks.
Layers give you a way to organize your Fireworks PNG image so that you can
easily turn groups of objects on or off (that is, make the groups of objects
visible or hide them), put objects on top of or beneath other objects, lock
groups of objects so they can’t be modified, and find things easily.
Frames, on the other hand, offer a way to organize layers so you can export
multiple states of buttons (different versions of the button, such as those that
appear when the button is rolled over or clicked by the user) and animated
GIFs quickly and easily.
The canvas is at the bottom of the stack of layers. It is not really a layer
itself — it can’t be expanded or collapsed, made visible or invisible, locked
or unlocked, or deleted.
The Web Layer, the repository for slices and hotspots, is always the top
layer, as you can see in Figure 5-1. You create slices in the Web Layer in
order to cut your page design into individual images. After images have

Managing Layers
262
been sliced, they can be optimized, exported, and placed in HTML pages,
where they may be hyperlinked. You create hotspots in the Web Layer to
make images that can be exported for your Web page along with some
HTML code that specifies areas in the image that are hyperlinked. The Web
Layer can be made visible or invisible, and it can be locked and unlocked,
but it cannot be deleted.
Managing Layers
Fireworks uses the concept of folders to describe how a layer functions.
(Notice the little folder icons next to the layer names in Figure 5-1.) So you
can think of a layer as a receptacle for “files” (image objects and text
objects). The individual “files” can be copied or moved to other layers,
deleted, named, renamed, and so on.
Take a closer look at the Layers panel. Looking left to right at an unex-
panded layer, you can see the following across four columns:
✦The Expand/Collapse button: A plus sign (+) in the box indicates that
the layer can be expanded. A minus sign (–) in the box indicates that the
layer can be collapsed. Click the control to toggle between expanded
and collapsed views of the layer.
✦The Show/Hide layer button: An eye appears in this column when the
layer is visible on the canvas. When the layer is invisible on the canvas,
the column is empty. Click in the column to toggle the layer’s visibility
on the canvas off and on. Note that when you export images from your
PNG, only visible objects are exported.
✦The Lock/Unlock button: If you click this column of a collapsed layer, a
lock appears, indicating that none of the objects on that layer can be
edited. If you click once on the layer name (in the fourth column) or
Figure 5-1:
The Layers
panel
displays a
stack of
layers in
their
collapsed
state.

Book III
Chapter 5
The Power of 
Layers and Frames
Managing Layers
263
turn on the Show/Hide layers button (in the second column), a pencil
appears in the third column, indicating that the layer is unlocked and
active. If the layer is unlocked and active, you can edit the objects in the
layer. Only one layer can be active at a time, though any number of
layers can be unlocked or locked.
✦The layer name: By default, Fireworks names each layer for the order in
which it was created. The first layer is called Layer 1, the second layer
is called Layer 2, and so on. (To find out how to give the layer a more
meaningful name, check out the “Renaming a layer” section, later in this
chapter.) When the layer is active, the layer name is highlighted in the
Layers panel.
Adding and deleting layers
When you add a new layer to your PNG, the new layer always gets added
above the currently selected layer. You can add a layer in three easy ways:
✦Click the Add/Duplicate Layer button (the folder with the plus sign on
it) at the bottom middle of the Layers panel.
✦Select Edit➪Insert➪Layer.
✦Choose New Layer from the Layer panel’s Options menu (the bulleted
list icon at the right of the panel’s title bar).
In either case, the New Layer dialog box appears, with the layer’s default
name highlighted. You need to type a new name for the layer and select the
Share Across Frames option if you’re making a multiple-frame document and
you want the objects on the new layer you created to be visible on the other
frames of your document. The newly created layer is active until you click
another layer.
To delete a layer, click it in the Layers panel and drag it to the Delete button
(the garbage can icon) at the bottom right of the Layers panel. You can also
click the layer, and then click the Delete button in the Layers panel.
Making a layer active
As noted previously, only one layer at a time can be active. However, many
objects on a layer can be editable simultaneously, which can come in handy
when you want to move several objects the same amount and in the same
direction. In order to change any object in a layer, you need to make the
layer active:
✦Make a layer active: Click an object on the canvas that’s in that layer, or
click the name of that layer in the Layers panel.

Managing Layers
264
✦Make a layer inactive, but not locked: Click an object on the canvas
that’s not in that layer, or click the name of another layer in the
Layers panel.
Sometimes when you have an object from one layer selected and you click
an object on another layer to make it active, the item you’re trying to select
won’t highlight. Why not? Look closely: You have selected a new layer, just
not the one you want. Often you find yourself in this position if you have a
very large object on the bottom layer of your file — when you try to click
something in front of it, Fireworks thinks you’re trying to click the large
object on the bottom layer and highlights it instead of the smaller object
(the one you’re trying to select) in front of it. Luckily, you can just click the
object you want to select in the Layers panel to make it active.
Expanding and collapsing layers
Because files can contain many layers, and layers can contain many objects,
and you have only so much room for the Layers panel, Fireworks allows you
to expand and collapse a layer as needed:
✦Expand a layer: Click the plus (+) button in the first column of that
layer. Each object in that layer appears on its own line below the layer
name. Each object has its own Show/Hide button, as well as a thumbnail
of the object and a name.
✦Collapse a layer: Click the minus (–) button. If the layer is active, it will
remain so until you click another layer or an object on the canvas that
resides on another layer.
Figure 5-2 shows the Layers panel with some layers collapsed and one layer
expanded to show the objects it contains.

Making a layer visible or invisible on the canvas
The more complicated your designs get, the more you’ll be showing and
hiding layers, that is, making them visible or invisible. Luckily, showing and
hiding layers is simple:
✦Make a layer visible (show a layer): Click in the second column or
the name column of the Layers panel.
✦Make a layer invisible (hide a layer): Click the Hide Layer button
(the eye icon) in the second column.
If you export your design as images (so you can use the images in a Web
page), objects on hidden/invisible layers will not be exported. In other
words, what you see on the canvas when you export is what you will get
in your exported images folder.
Locking and unlocking a layer
Sometimes when you have a lot of overlapping objects, selecting some objects
without selecting others can get difficult. One way to prevent objects from
being accidentally moved or deleted is to lock the layer they’re on. You can’t
lock individual objects, but you can move objects from one layer to another
(say, from an unlocked layer to a layer you can then lock).
✦Lock a layer: Click in the third column. If the column is blank when you
click in it, the lock appears. If the column has a pencil in it, the pencil
changes to a lock, and the pencil appears in an adjacent layer, if there
is one.
✦Unlock a layer: Click the lock in the third column of that layer.
Unlocking a layer does not automatically make it active.
Renaming a layer
By default, each layer is named for the order in which it was created. The
first layer is called Layer 1, the second is called Layer 2, and so on. If you
have only a couple of layers in your document, that naming scheme may
be sufficient. If you have dozens of layers, on the other hand, you’ll want
to place similar objects together on layers and then name the layers so you
can tell with a quick glance at the Layers panel where the objects are.
To rename a layer from its default name, just follow these simple steps:
1. Double-click the layer name.
A simple dialog box appears. The current name is in the text field, in a
highlighted state.

Managing Layers
266
2. Type a new name.
You don’t need to click in the text field, because the current layer name
is already highlighted. If you want to keep part of the current name, use
your mouse to select the part of the name you want to replace or
remove and type over or delete it.
3. If you have multiple frames in your document and you want this layer
to be visible in the other frames, select the Share Across Frames
check box.
Otherwise, move on to Step 4.
4. Press the Enter key.
The dialog box closes, and your layer has a new name.
Moving a layer in front of or behind other layers
As you add layers to your PNG file, they stack up. The higher a layer
appears in the Layers panel, the closer the objects in that layer are to the
front of the canvas. Likewise, within a layer, the higher an object appears,
the closer it is to the front of the canvas.
Figure 5-3 illustrates the relationship between objects, their position on the
canvas, and their position in the Layers panel. The before part (on the top)
of Figure 5-3 shows the bowling ball in front of both pins, and in the Layers
panel, the object named “bowling ball” is above the “pin” objects. The after
part (on the bottom) of Figure 5-3 shows the large pin in front of the bowling
ball. The ball, in turn, is in front of a smaller bowling pin. In the Layers
panel, the ball object is between the pin objects.
You can change the order of a layer or object as follows:
✦Move a layer or object in front of another: Click the name column of
the layer or object and drag it up. A black horizontal line appears
when you roll over a spot where you can place the layer or object.
Release the mouse button to drop the layer or object in its new 
location.
✦Move a layer or object behind another: Click the name column of
the layer or object and drag it down. A black horizontal line appears
when you roll over a spot where you can place the layer or object.
Release the mouse button to drop the layer or object in its new 
location:

Merging layers
Sometimes in the process of creating a PNG document, you’ll find that you
need all the objects you’ve made but you don’t need them to be on so many
layers. If you want to move one or two objects from one layer to another,
you can do so using the method described in the previous section, “Moving
a layer in front of or behind other layers.” If, on the other hand, you want to
move all the objects in one layer to another, and there are quite a few
objects in each layer, you’re better off merging the layers.
To merge all the objects on one layer into a single bitmap object in the layer
immediately underneath, follow these steps:
1. Click in the name column of the layer in the Layers panel.
Make sure all the objects in the layer are highlighted. (If they’re not, you
may have clicked an object in the layer instead of the layer itself.)
2. If necessary, drag the layer so it’s on top of the layer you want to
merge into.
You use the Merge Down command later in this process, so you need to
make sure the two layers are one on top of the other.
3. Click the Options menu icon (it looks like a bulleted list) at the top
right of the Layers panel and select Merge Down.
The selected layer merges into the one below it. Note that the objects in
the upper layer are combined into a single bitmap object in the new
layer. Text in the new object is not editable, and vector shapes in the
new object are now bitmaps.
You can also use the key command Ctrl+E to merge a layer into the one
below it, or choose Modify➪Merge Down.
To merge all the layers together into one, do the following:
1. Click in the name column of any layer in the Layers panel.
2. Choose Modify➪Flatten Layers.
Your document now has a single layer. Each object remains separate
from the others.
Using Layers for Masking
A mask is a layer that you create specifically to let some areas of an image
show while other areas are hidden. Fireworks uses two kinds of masks —
bitmap masks and vector masks (you can use text as a vector mask). What

Book III
Chapter 5
The Power of 
Layers and Frames
Using Layers for Masking
269
both kinds of masks have in common is what they do: When you lay a mask
over an image, the mask blocks out parts of the image and lets other parts
show through. Which parts show through and which are blocked out is
determined by the shape of the mask, as Figure 5-4 demonstrates.
When you use a bitmap mask, the grayscale values of the mask determine
what, and how much, shows through. The lighter the pixel, the more the
object or objects beneath show through. The darker the pixel, the less the
stuff underneath shows through.
A vector mask, on the other hand, uses the shape outline of the vector object
like a cookie cutter. However, Fireworks gives you a lot more flexibility than
you have with a real cookie cutter! For example, you can anti-alias (smooth
out jagged edges) and even feather (blur) the edges of your mask, or you
can change the size of your mask at any time after you have created it.
Fireworks offers many ways to create masks. We cover the basics here, but
you can always refer to the Fireworks Help files if you’re interested in
exploring masks more in-depth.
Creating a bitmap mask
To make a bitmap mask using an existing bitmap, follow these steps:
Figure 5-4:
This image

by masking
a beach

of a dog.

Using Layers for Masking
270
1. If you want to mask multiple objects, group them by selecting them
and using the key command Ctrl+G.
2. Select the object you want to use to make the mask.
You can select multiple objects to make a mask by Shift+clicking them,
but if you do, Fireworks automatically makes a vector mask, not a
bitmap mask. See the section “Creating a vector mask” if you want to
make a vector mask using multiple bitmap objects.
3. Choose Edit➪Cut, or use the key command Ctrl+X.
Cut? That’s right. You paste the shape in a couple of steps.
4. Select the layer, object, or group you want to be visible through the
mask by selecting it in the Layers panel or on the canvas.
The layer, object, or group is highlighted.
5. Choose Edit➪Paste as Mask.
All the parts of the masked image that fall outside the masking object
disappear. In the Layers panel, the mask icon shows up in the third
column, while a link icon and thumbnail of the mask shape show up
next to the thumbnail of the masked image.
6. If it’s not already selected, select Alpha channel in the Property
inspector.
When the mask is selected in the Layers panel, the Property inspector
offers two options for a bitmap mask: Mask to Alpha Channel and Mask
to Grayscale (the default), as shown in Figure 5-5. Mask to Alpha
Channel uses the transparency of the mask bitmap, and Mask to
Grayscale uses the brightness of the pixels in the mask bitmap.
Bitmaps can be represented as having four channels: Red, Green, Blue, and
Alpha. The Red, Green, and Blue channels describe the amount of each of
those colors in every pixel in the bitmap. The Alpha channel contains infor-
mation about the level of transparency of each pixel in the bitmap.

271
You can hide a mask temporarily by clicking it in the Layers panel and then
choosing Disable Mask from the Layers panel’s Options menu (the bulleted
list icon at the top right of the panel). The mask icon disappears from the
Show/Hide object column and a red X appears over the mask, indicating
that the mask is disabled. To re-enable the mask, simply click it.
To make a bitmap mask by creating an empty mask and modifying it, follow
these steps:
1. Select the object you want to mask by clicking it on the canvas or in
the Layers panel.
2. Click the Mask button at the bottom of the Layers panel or choose
Modify➪Mask➪Reveal All.
The Mask icon is the rectangle with a dotted circle inside. Reveal All
means the mask you have made will be completely transparent until 
you modify it.
3. Select a paintbrush or other drawing tool and draw on top of the
bitmap.
Wherever you draw, the mask blocks the image behind.
What if you want to do the opposite: Reveal what’s underneath only where
you draw? Easy! Just follow these steps:
1. Select the object you want to mask by clicking it on the canvas or in
the Layers panel.
2. Choose Modify➪Mask➪Hide All.
Hide All means the mask you have made will be completely opaque until
you modify it, so when you first apply it, your masked object will seem
to have disappeared.
3. Select any color other than black.
Because the opaque areas of the mask are represented as black, the
areas that you want to show through must be drawn using any other
color.
4. Select a paintbrush or other drawing tool and draw on top of the
bitmap.
Wherever you draw, the mask reveals the image behind.
You can delete a mask by clicking it in the Layers panel, and then choosing
Delete Mask from the Layers panel’s Options menu (the bulleted list icon at
the top right of the panel). When you delete a mask, a dialog box appears to
give you the option to apply the mask before deleting it, which will change
the masked image.

Using Layers for Masking
272
Creating a vector mask
To make a vector mask, such as the one shown in Figure 5-6, follow these
steps:
1. Select a text block or vector shape by clicking on the shape on the
canvas or in the Layers panel.
The object is highlighted on the canvas and in the Layers panel.
2. Drag the shape or text over the object or objects you want to mask.
The layer with the shape doesn’t have to be on top of the layers with
the objects you want to mask, but it’s easier to position the shape if you
can see it!
3. Choose Edit➪Cut or use the key command Ctrl+X.
You paste the shape in a couple of steps, so you need to cut it here.
4. Select the layer or object you want to be visible through the mask by
clicking it in the Layers panel or on the canvas.
The layer or object is highlighted.
5. Choose Edit➪Paste as Mask.
All the parts of the masked image that fall outside the mask shape or
text disappear. In the Layers panel, the mask icon shows up in the third
column, and a link icon and thumbnail of the mask shape appear next to
the thumbnail of the masked image, as shown in Figure 5-7.

The Power of 
Layers and Frames
Using the Web Layer
273
Using the Web Layer
The Web Layer was the greatest innovation of the original version of
Fireworks, and if it no longer seems revolutionary, it’s still as handy a fea-
ture as you’ll come across in making Web pages. The Web Layer allows you
to cut your page layout into slices, which are pieces of your layout, held in
place by HTML, that end up as individual images on your Web page. The
Web Layer also allows you to name and optimize each slice individually,
which means that you can find the best balance of file size and image quality
for each piece of your layout. Just as importantly, because it’s a repository
for slice information, the Web Layer allows you to save slice coordinates,
dimensions, and optimization settings along with everything else in your
PNG file.
You never have to leave the Fireworks application to ready your images for
the Web, and you don’t have to write down or remember your image size,
placement, and optimization settings if you ever need to remake an image.
The Web Layer also allows you to see at a glance where your slices are,
which helps you recreate your page design in HTML. For details about 
slices and image optimization (including when to use GIFs and when to use
JPEGs), see Book III, Chapter 6.
Standard HTML pages are built on a grid system of cells organized into rows
and columns. The rows and columns make up a table. You can have multiple
tables on a Web page, and you can even have tables within tables within
tables. You can set the height of each row and the width of each column
individually, but you can’t make a round cell or a triangular table.
If you use Fireworks to make your HTML, each slice you make in your PNG
ends up as an image that fills a table cell in your Web page. It is possible to
combine multiple images in a single cell, but Fireworks is not made to work
that way.
Think of your Web page design as a rectangular sheet cake. The decorations
on top of the cake can be all kinds of shapes, but when you cut the cake,
Figure 5-7:
An active
mask in 
the Layers
panel.

Using the Web Layer
274
you probably make rectangular slices, cutting right through text, slicing
a single icing rose into four pieces, and so on. You ignore the design on
the surface of the cake because you’re more interested in slicing the
cake quickly and controlling the size of each piece. You might make a few
specially-cut pieces if somebody really wants the blue rose near the top or
the exclamation points from the text that says, “Happy Birthday!!!”
When you are cutting up a Web page, you will want certain pieces to remain
intact (a corporate logo or a navigation button, for example), but other
objects will fit the HTML grid structure better if they are sliced into pieces
or included with other objects on a single piece. If you have an object with
round edges, you need to slice it into rectangles so it can be reconstructed
on a Web page, like the bowling ball shown in Figure 5-8. The bowling ball
will be recreated in HTML as three stacked rectangles. The middle slice in
Figure 5-8 is selected, so its name and image compression type appear at the
top left of the slice.
Using the Slice tool
The Slice tool, which can be found in the Web section of the Tools panel,
looks like a utility knife on a green square with red lines on each side. When

Book III
Chapter 5
The Power of

Using the Web Layer
275
you employ the Slice tool, the slices you create are added automatically to
the Web Layer.
To make a slice in your PNG file, follow these steps:
1. Select the Slice tool from the Web section of the Tools panel.
2. Click and drag diagonally on the canvas to make a rectangle.
The slice shows up as a green overlay on the canvas.
Using the Polygon Slice tool
The Slice tool has a partner “hidden” behind it in the toolbar: the Polygon
Slice tool, which you can get to by clicking and holding the Slice tool until
the pop-up menu containing the Polygon Slice tool appears, or by clicking
the Slice tool and pressing K on your keyboard.
You can probably guess that the Polygon Slice tool allows you to make 
non-rectangular slices. But wait! Didn’t we say that slices and images must
be rectangular? The short answer is that the Polygon Slice tool doesn’t
create a non-rectangular slice — it creates a rectangular slice with a polygo-
nal hotspot (a polygonal area that can be hyperlinked in combination with
some HTML code) inside.
So what’s the difference between a polygonal hotspot made by the Polygon
Slice tool and one made by the Polygon Hotspot tool? The Polygon Hotspot
tool doesn’t make a slice, it just makes an irregularly-shaped linkable area in
a slice. (A slice may contain many hotspots, each linked to a different page.)
The Polygon Slice tool, on the other hand, makes both hotspots and slices.
If you have a map of the United States, and you want each state to link to its
own HTML page, use the Polygon Hotspot tool to make linked areas in the
shape of each state. (For more information on the Polygon Hotspot tool, see
Book III, Chapter 6.) If you just have a few irregularly shaped buttons, you
can use the Polygon Slice tool to make a linkable image.
To make a polygonal slice, follow these steps:
1. Select the Polygon Slice tool from the Slice tool menu in the Web area
of the Tools panel.
If the regular Slice tool is showing, click and hold the Slice tool button to
reveal the pop-up menu so you can select the Polygon Slice tool.
2. Click a series of points to make a polygonal shape.
Fireworks automatically draws straight lines to connect each point to
the last. You do not need to click the first spot to close the shape.

Working with Objects
276
Working with Objects
In the world of Fireworks, an object is any self-contained bitmap, vector
shape, or text block that can appear on the canvas. The object may include
blank space, and you can make a single object out of many objects (as you
do when you merge layers, which we discuss earlier in this chapter). In gen-
eral, anything in your design that you want to be able to edit individually
should be left as a single object.
Renaming an object in the Layers panel
By default, each object is named for its type (path, bitmap, and so on) but
can be individually renamed. As with layers, being able to name objects in
the Layers panel becomes crucial as you add more elements to your design.
The Layers panel does contain thumbnails of each object, but if you have
multiple similar objects in several places on the canvas, you may want a
way to tell the objects apart in the Layers panel.
To rename an object, double-click the current name of the object in the
Layers panel and type a new name in the text field that appears. Press Enter
or click outside the text field to save the new name. Renaming an object
makes it active. When the object is active, the line around the icon is high-
lighted and the column reverses to a black background with white text.
Moving an object between layers
You may want to move an object from the layer it was originally created on
to a different layer. For example, you may want an object to be stacked on
top of or under other items on the canvas and have other objects in the
layer remain exactly where they are. Luckily, moving an object from one
layer to another is a snap.
To move an object from one layer to another, click the name column of the
object in the Layers panel and drag it to a new location. A black horizontal
line appears when you roll over a spot where you can place the object.
Release the mouse button to drop the object in its new location.
Setting an object’s opacity/transparency
You can set each object’s transparency independently by using the slider
near the top left of the Layers panel. By default, objects are completely
opaque, and the opaque object completely blocks out whatever objects 
are underneath it, as in Figure 5-3. You can make the objects on a layer 
semi-transparent, which allows the objects underneath to show through
by an adjustable amount.

Book III
Chapter 5
The Power of 
Layers and Frames
Working with Objects
277
The extreme ends of the Opacity/Transparency scale are 100 percent
opaque (which can also be thought of as 0 percent transparent) and 0 
percent opaque (100 percent transparent). When you add an object to the
canvas, its default opacity of 100 shows up at the top left of the Layers panel
and in the object’s Property inspector.
To adjust the transparency of a layer, follow these simple steps:
1. Click the name column of the object you want to adjust or click the
object on the canvas to select the object.
The object is highlighted on both the canvas and in the Layers panel.
2. Click and drag the Opacity/Transparency slider to adjust how opaque
the object will be.
The Opacity/Transparency slider is the button with the downward-
pointing arrow located near the top left of the Layers panel, next to 
the Opacity text field. (You can find an identical slider in the Property
inspector.)
3. Release the mouse button when you get to the setting you want.
You can also type a number from 0 to 100 into the text field next to the
slider to set the object’s transparency. Remember to press the Enter key to
apply the new setting.
Fireworks can do a few fancier tricks with opacity. For example, you can set
an opacity gradient, so some parts of your object are more transparent than
others. See the next section on blending for more information on this topic.
Blending
Blending one object with another has to do with varying the transparency of
the top object so some of the bottom object shows through. But blending in
Fireworks involves more than just adjusting opacity. You can use a dozen
blending modes in conjunction with the Opacity control and the colors of
your objects to produce different blending effects:
✦Normal: The default blending mode, normal, actually means there’s no
blending going on at all.
✦Multiply: This mode multiplies the value of each pixel of the top object
with each pixel of the objects underneath, which generally results in a
darker color.
✦Screen: This mode divides the value of each pixel of the bottom object
by each pixel of the object on top and produces a lighter color.

Working with Objects
278
✦Darken: This mode replaces pixels of the top object that are lighter
than the pixels in the object underneath with the darker pixels
from below.
✦Lighten: This mode replaces pixels of the top object that are darker
than the object underneath with the lighter pixels from the object
below.
✦Difference: This mode subtracts the darker color from the color with
more brightness, regardless of which is on top.
✦Hue: This mode replaces the luminance and saturation of a pixel on top
with those of the pixel underneath.
✦Saturation: This mode replaces the hue and luminance of a pixel on top
with those of the pixel underneath.
✦Color: This mode replaces the luminance of a pixel on top with that of
the pixel underneath, but keeps the hue and saturation of the top pixel
the same.
✦Luminosity: This mode replaces the hue and saturation of the pixel on
top with those of the pixel underneath, leaving the luminance of the
pixel on top.
✦Invert: This mode changes the colors of the pixels in the object under-
neath to their opposites, regardless of the colors of the object on top.
✦Tint: This mode adds gray to the areas of overlap.
✦Erase: This mode removes all pixels in the overlapping areas, leaving a
hole in the canvas. Any objects underneath the object with a blend
mode of erase will be invisible where the objects overlap.
Layers can have blending modes, but the blending mode settings of individ-
ual objects on the layer override the settings of the layer they’re on. That
means different objects on the same layer can have individualized blend 
settings. The blending mode of a group of objects, however, overrides the
blending modes of individual objects within the group. Removing the blend-
ing mode of the group restores the blending modes of the individual objects.
To blend an existing object with whatever is under it, just follow these
steps:
1. Select the object you want to blend by clicking it on the canvas or in
the Layers panel.
2. Select a blending mode from the drop-down list at the top-right of the
Layers panel.
When you release the mouse button, the blend mode takes effect.
3. If you want, adjust the transparency of the object by typing a value
between 1 and 100 in the Opacity text field next to the blending

Book III
Chapter 5

Layers and Frames
Working with Objects
279
mode list or by using the Opacity/Transparency slider between the
Opacity text field and the blending mode list.
Any objects that you put under the blended object will be affected by (or
will affect) the blended object where both objects overlap.
You can also establish a blend’s opacity and mode before you create an
object by setting the properties of a drawing tool in the Property inspector,
as shown in Figure 5-9. (Note: Not all tools permit this.) Your settings will
apply every time you use that tool. Remember, individual object blend set-
tings override the blend settings of the layer the object is on.
To set the blend before you draw, follow these steps:
1. Use the key command Ctrl+D or choose Edit➪Deselect to make sure
you don’t have any objects selected.
If you have an object selected, you might accidentally change its blend
mode when you’re trying to set one for the object you’re about to
create.
2. Select a drawing tool, such as the Brush tool.
Some tools cannot have their blends changed from the default, Normal.
3. Select a color for the tool.
See the section on adding color in Book III, Chapter 2 if you don’t know
how to select a color for the tool. You can always change the color of
the object later, but that can get complicated, especially if you have a
special blend mode and opacity set.
4. Select a blending mode from the drop-down list at the top-right of the
Layers panel or from the identical list in the tool’s Property inspector.
5. If desired, set an opacity for the tool by dragging the Layers panel’s
Opacity/Transparency slider (the button with the downward-pointing
arrow between the Opacity text field and the blending mode list) or
typing a value in the Layers panel’s Opacity text field.
Alternatively, you can set the opacity in the rightmost section of the
tool’s Property inspector in the same way.
6. Use the tool to make your vector shape or bitmap.
The tool’s blend and opacity settings remain in effect until you change
them. After you create an object, you can always adjust its blend and
opacity settings. You may want to create a new layer (see the section
“Adding and deleting layers”) before making a new object. If you don’t
make a new layer, remember that the object’s blend settings override
the layer’s blend settings.

Managing Frames
280
Managing Frames
Given all that you can do with layers, you may be wondering why you would
need these things called “frames.” Frames are essentially sets of layers that
enable you to do two things that layers alone can’t accomplish:
✦Export multiple button states (different versions of the button such as
those that appear when the button is rolled over or clicked by the user)
simultaneously
✦Create and export animated GIFs (files that contain multiple GIF images
displayed in sequence)
You can think of layers as stacked one on top of the other; frames, on the
other hand, are better visualized as a series, each following the previous in
the same location but at a later time, like a flip book. Each frame is distinct
from the others. A given frame may share layers or objects with other
frames, but the shared layers or objects are usually different from one frame
to the next (the objects are a different color, have a different effect applied
to them, or are at different coordinates). These differences make up multiple
button states or animated GIFs.

Book III
Chapter 5
The Power of 
Layers and Frames
Managing Frames
281
The Frames panel (see Figure 5-12) displays frames in much the same way
as the Layers panel displays layers, except that the Frames panel doesn’t
show the objects contained within each frame.
Like layers, frames can be duplicated, added, and deleted. You must have at
least two frames in your Fireworks PNG file in order to export buttons with
rollover states or animated GIFs.
Adding frames
By default, your Fireworks PNG has a single frame, which contains all the
layers in the file. To add a frame to your file, just follow these steps:
1. Click the Options menu (the bulleted list icon) at the top right of the
Frames panel and choose Add Frames or Duplicate Frame from the
menu.
Choose Duplicate Frame if you want the objects in the current frame to
be copied to the new frames. Choose Add Frames if you want to add
empty frames to your file. Either the Add Frames or Duplicate Frame
dialog box (shown in Figure 5-10) appears, both of which have identical
parameters.
2. Enter a number or click the arrow next to the text field to use a slider
to set the number of frames you would like to add:
• For a simple rollover, you want one additional frame, for a total of
two frames in your file.
• If you want your button to have an on state as well as a highlight
(rollover) and normal state, you want two additional frames, for a
total of three frames.
• If you want a highlight-while-on state, you want three additional
frames, for a total of four frames.
The slider goes from 0 through 10, but you can type in values higher
than 10.

Using Frames to Create Rollovers and Animated GIFs
282
If your animated GIF has more than 20 frames, the file size may be pro-
hibitively large. For complicated animations, you’re better off using
Macromedia Flash MX 2004.
3. Select one of the options for where the new frames should be added
in reference to the current one.
You have the following options:
• At the Beginning: The first new frame becomes Frame 1 and the
remaining frames are numbered sequentially, regardless of how
many frames you currently have in your document, and regardless
of which frame is currently active.
• Before Current Frame: The frames are added before the currently
active frame.
• After Current Frame: The frames are added after the currently
active frame.
• At the End: The new frames are the last frames, no matter how 
many frames you already have or which frame is currently active.
4. Click OK.
Deleting and editing frames
To delete a frame, click the frame in the Frames panel and drag it to the
garbage can icon at the bottom right of the Frames panel. To delete multiple
frames simultaneously, Shift+click all the frames in the Frames panel that
you want to delete and, while the frames are highlighted, click the garbage
can icon at the bottom right of the Frames panel.
You can select a frame for editing two ways:
✦Click the frame in the Frames panel.
✦Click and hold the frame indicator at the bottom left of the Layers
panel. A drop-down list appears, giving you easy access to all the
frames in your document. Simply select the frame you want to edit.
Renaming frames
Renaming frames is a simple matter: Double-click the frame’s name in the
Frames panel and type the new name in the text field that appears.
Using Frames to Create Rollovers and Animated GIFs
Now that you know how to make and manage frames, you’re ready to use
them! In this section we cover how to create rollovers and animated GIFs,
both of which can add interest to your Web site.

Book III
Chapter 5
The Power of 
Layers and Frames
Using Frames to Create Rollovers and Animated GIFs
283
Creating a rollover
Creating a button rollover is really just a matter of making two (or three
or even four) versions of a button graphic, each on its own frame. Dream-
weaver MX 2004 allows you to generate rollover code pretty easily, but you
can also have Fireworks make the rollover code along with the HTML.
To make a simple button rollover, follow these steps:
1. Make a button, or set of buttons, using the processes outlined in Book
III, Chapters 3 and 4.
The button can have text or an icon, it can have a shape or bitmap
under the text or icon, and it can be any shape or size you like (but you
probably want to keep it on the small side to limit file size and leave
room on your page for content). For easy housekeeping, if you’re creat-
ing a navigation bar, keep all the buttons for which you want to have
additional states on the same layer.
2. Make sure the layer on which you have your buttons is not shared
across frames.
By default, objects on layers are not shared across frames. If a layer
is shared across frames, changes to any objects in that layer will be
reflected in all frames. If a layer is shared across frames, the Shared
icon (which resembles a ladder or strip of film with arrows on both
sides) appears to the right of the layer name in the Layers panel.
To disable sharing across frames, double-click the layer and deselect
the Share Across Frames check box.
3. Add one frame after the current frame by clicking the New/Duplicate
Frame button in the Frames panel or by choosing Add Frames from
the Frames panel’s Options menu (the bulleted list icon at the top
right of the panel).
4. In Frame 2, edit the objects that make up your button to create a high-
lighted rollover state.
The highlighted rollover state is the image that will swap in when the
user rolls the cursor over the button.
You can make the text a different color or add a glow to it, or you can
make the vector shape or bitmap a different color. There are too many
options to mention here, really. Just make sure the difference is notice-
able when the user moves a cursor over the button.
5. Make a slice overlaying the button graphic.
See Book III, Chapter 6 for details on making slices, or just check out the
“Using the Slice tool” section, earlier in this chapter.

Using Frames to Create Rollovers and Animated GIFs
284
6. Click and release the mouse button in the middle of the slice to
access the Add Behavior pop-up menu, and choose the Add Simple
Rollover behavior.
When a slice is active, you can see the Target icon in the middle of the
slice. When you place your cursor over the target, it becomes a hand.
If you want to test the rollover, click the Preview tab at the top of the canvas
to make the Preview pane active. Place your cursor over your button in the
Preview pane to see the Rollover behavior in action. Next move the cursor
off the button to see the button return to its normal state — that behavior is
part of a Simple Rollover.
Adding an on state (for when the user is on the Web page the button repre-
sents) and a highlight-while-on state (for when the user rolls over the button
on the Web page the button represents) are as simple as repeating Steps 3
and 4 above, and adding more behaviors via the Behaviors panel. See Book
III, Chapter 7 for further details.
Creating an animated GIF
You may find that the easiest way to create an animated GIF is to build one
frame, duplicate it, edit that frame, duplicate it, and so on. Fireworks has a
display mode called onion skinning, which is especially handy for building
animated GIFs. With onion skinning turned on, illustrated in Figure 5-11, you
can see the frame you’re working on, plus dimmed versions either of the
next frame, the previous and next frames, or all frames. That can be very
useful in helping you pace your animation to get the illusion of smooth
motion.

285
To activate onion skinning, just follow these steps:
1. Click the Onion Skinning button (the downward-pointing pentagon)
at the lower left of the Frames panel.
The Onion Skinning menu pops up.
2. Select one of the four options:
• Show Next Frame: Select the Show Next Frame option if you already
have your frames set up and want to check frames two at a time.
• Before and After: Select the Before and After option if you want to
see the previous and next frames as well as the current frame.
• Show All Frames: Select the Show All Frames option to see all the
frames at once.
• Custom: Select the Custom option if you want to set the number of
frames visible at once and to customize their transparencies.
3. Leave the Multi-Frame Editing option selected if you want to be able
to edit the objects in the visible but not current frames.
Use the Select Behind tool to select objects in frames other than the
current one.
When you duplicate a frame, you duplicate the objects in it. When you edit
an object in a frame, though, you change only that instance of it. In our
bowling ball animation, shown in Figure 5-11, we rotated the ball (as well as
moved it left) in each frame to give the illusion that the ball is rolling. If we
wanted to, we could have the ball be a different color in each frame as well.
Setting the frame rate
The frame rate is the speed at which each frame follows the previous frame.
You can set the rate to be the same all the way through the animation, or
you can set individually the amount of time each frame stays on-screen.
To set a constant frame rate, follow these steps:
1. Click the first frame and Shift+click the last frame in the Frames panel
to select all the Frames.
All the frames highlight.
2. Double-click the frame delay column (the right-hand column) of any
frame in the Frames panel.
The Frame Delay dialog box appears.

Using Frames to Create Rollovers and Animated GIFs
286
3. Type a number in the Frame Delay text field to set the amount of time
in hundredths of a second that each frame will remain on-screen.
If you want the frames to be on-screen for more than a second, the
number you type should be over 100. For example, if you type 350, each
frame will be on-screen for 3.5 seconds. You won’t get much of an illu-
sion of motion at that frame rate, however! The less time each frame is
on-screen, the more frames of your animation will appear each second.
The more frames per second, the smoother the animation looks. But the
more frames you have in your animation, the bigger the file.
4. Press Enter.
To change the amount of time one frame stays on-screen, follow these steps:
1. Double-click the frame delay column (the right-hand column) of any
frame in the Frames panel.
The Frame Delay dialog box appears.
2. Type a new number in the Frame Delay text field to set the amount of
time in hundredths of a second that the frame will remain on-screen.
3. Press Enter.
To loop or not to loop
Fireworks allows you to loop your animation, which causes it to automati-
cally start over at the beginning after playing the last frame. You can have
the GIF loop indefinitely, you can set it to play once (stopping at the last
frame), or to play a designated number of times and then stop on the
last frame.
The default for animated GIFs is to loop endlessly. To make a GIF that stops
at the final frame, just follow these steps:
1. Click the GIF Animation Looping button (the oval with an arrow) at
the bottom of the Frames panel.
The Looping pop-up menu appears.
2. Select a number of times you want the animation to repeat, or select
No Looping if you want it to play only once.
Because you’re setting the amount of times for it to repeat, if you select
1, that means the animation will play twice through and stop. Note that
after you have made your choice, the choice appears next to the Loop
button, as shown in Figure 5-12.

The Frames panel, shown in Figure 5-12, shows what mode of onion skinning
is on, if any, and on which frames (first column); it also shows the frame
name (second column), frame delay (third column), and looping informa-
tion (bottom).
Previewing animated GIFs
You can preview animated GIFs in the Preview pane (click Preview at the 
top of the canvas to view the Preview pane). The available controls are as
follows:
✦Go to first frame
✦Play/Stop
✦Go to last frame
✦Go back one frame
✦Go forward one frame
The animation plays at the frame rate you have set for it, and conveniently,
you can adjust the frame rate in the Frames panel without leaving the
Preview pane. Your animation will loop in the Preview pane, even if it’s set
not to loop for export. Onion skinning is not visible in the Preview pane.

 Exporting images
A
fter you have designed your page, you need to figure out how to trans-
late your design to the Web. If you’re planning to export HTML as well
as images from Fireworks and plan not to mess with the code afterward,
that’s okay. When you want to make changes to the Web page, you can do
so in Fireworks and then re-export the HTML and images.
Of course, you can also export all the images from Fireworks but generate
the HTML code by hand. Regardless of your Web-coding skill level or your
site maintenance needs, you’ll want to slice and optimize your images, and
luckily doing so is easy with Fireworks. The following section, “Exploring
the Advantages of Using Slices,” explains the whys and hows of slicing your
design in Fireworks; for more information on image optimization, see the
“Optimizing Your Images for the Web” section, later in this chapter.
Exploring the Advantages of Using Slices
When we introduce the Web Layer in the previous chapter, we offer the 
analogy that a design for a Web page is like a sheet cake. Of course, when
you slice a cake, the point is to eat it. When you slice a page layout, like the
one in Figure 6-1, the aim is to optimize (reduce the file size of) your images
so that you can reconstruct your design with HTML in such a way as to bal-
ance image quality with download time.

Exploring the Advantages of Using Slices
290
Slicing your design offers two advantages:
✦Individually optimized images: Each sliced image can be compressed
by a different amount using the most appropriate method, giving you
maximum control over the balance between image quality and down-
load time.
✦Gradual download: The browser displays each sliced image as it is
downloaded to the user’s computer, so the page appears to build gradu-
ally. Users are much more engaged by watching this process than by
staring at a blank screen waiting for a complete page to load all at once!
When you use slices in combination with frames, you gain other advantages
(for more on frames, see Book III, Chapter 5). The main advantage is that
you can export multiple images simultaneously from a single slice, which is
the easiest way to make buttons that change based on user actions. (See the
“Exporting Images” section, later in this chapter, for the details.)
A Web page made up of a single image may be simple to make but may take
too long to download on a dial-up modem because the image file is so large.
That’s where slices come in. Although there’s no minimum or maximum
number of slices that you can make on a page, you don’t want to make too
many slices. Having lots of teeny-weeny images can result in a page that
loads too gradually. It’s a question of balance.
Every image tag in a Web page’s HTML code results in a call to the Web
site’s host server. The more images you have on your page, the more
requests for images the browser has to make, and the more images the

where

images to
export.

server has to send. That can feel like having a waiter bring you a salad
one piece of lettuce at a time — with you having to request each piece!
Creating and Editing Slices
In Book III, Chapter 5, we cover the basics of how to make a slice, but here
we give you some more details. So you don’t have to flip back to the previ-
ous chapter, here’s a reminder on how to make a slice in your Fireworks
PNG file:
1. Select the Slice tool from the Web section of the Tools panel.
2. Click and drag diagonally on the canvas to make a rectangle.
The slice shows up as a green overlay on the canvas.
The default appearance of the slice is as a bright green semi-transparent
overlay. You can change the default color of slices in the Preferences set-
tings. You can also change the color of an individual slice in the Property
inspector when you have the slice selected. Changing a slice color does not
affect the underlying image in any way.
One handy feature of the Slice tool is its snap feature. If you have navigation
buttons on the left side of your page, you may want the buttons all to be the
same width to simplify your HTML. When you have a single slice made for
your first button and you click and drag to make the slice for the second
button, Fireworks will snap to the identical width when your cursor is
within a few pixels of it. Of course, you can also make sure they’re the
same width by typing a value into the width text field, or by copying and
pasting the slice.
Naming a slice
When you name a slice, you’re doing more than making it easy to identify
in the Layers panel — you’re also naming the image for export. For that
reason, when you name a slice, you want to avoid using spaces or any spe-
cial characters that are illegal in filenames. You should also limit any name
to no more than 27 characters (otherwise, Macintosh users will not get to
see the image).
To name or rename a slice, just follow these steps:
1. Double-click the current name of the slice in the Layers panel.
A text field pops up, as shown in Figure 6-2. By default, slices are named
“Slice.” If you don’t see the slices, you may have to expand the Web
layer by clicking the plus (+) button at the left.

Creating and Editing Slices
292
2. Type a new name for the slice.
3. Press Enter.
You may notice that when a slice is selected, the Property inspector gives you
access to the slice’s name, dimensions, position on the page, and more. You
can also change the name of the slice in the Property inspector rather than
in the Layers panel.
Moving a slice
After you have created a slice, you may find yourself needing to move it. For
example, if you moved some elements in your design a few pixels one way
or the other, the image underlying the slice may have shifted enough that
you need to adjust the slice’s position. You can choose between three basic
ways of moving a slice:
✦Move a slice by clicking and dragging the slice. (In most cases, you’ll
probably want to use this method.)
✦Use the arrow keys to move a slice.
✦Change the X and Y coordinates of the slice in the Property inspector.
Be aware that if you overlap slices on the canvas, the overlapped area will
only appear in the image created from one of the slices — the one that
appears higher in the Layers panel.
To move a slice using the click-and-drag method, just follow these steps:
1. Click the slice on the canvas.
You can click anywhere on the slice except the corners and the center.
Clicking a corner or the center of a slice gives you special options.
2. Hold down the mouse button and drag the slice to its new location.
If you want finer control when you move a slice, you can use the arrow keys
to move a slice as follows:
Figure 6-2:

button.

Book III
Chapter 6
Slicing Up Content
for the Web
Creating and Editing Slices
293
1. Select the slice by clicking it on the canvas or in the Layers panel.
2. Press the appropriate arrow key.
Each time you press an arrow key, the slice moves by one pixel. If you
hold down the Shift key and then press an arrow key, the slice moves by
ten pixels.
Sometimes when you want to line something up along one axis, the easiest
way to do that is to select slices and type the new X or Y coordinate for
each slice. The top-left corner of the canvas always has the coordinates
(0, 0), and coordinates are expressed in the form (X, Y). If your design is
800 pixels wide and 600 pixels high, the bottom-right corner has the coordi-
nates (800, 600).
To move a slice when you know the exact pixel coordinates to which you
want to move it, follow these steps:
1. Select the slice by clicking it on the canvas or in the Layers panel.
The Property inspector changes to give you access to slice parameters.
2. If you want to change the slice’s horizontal position, type a numerical
value in the Property inspector text field labeled X: and press Enter.
Your slice shifts left if you type in a lower number or right if you type in
a higher number.
3. If you want to change the slice’s vertical position, type a numerical
value in the Property inspector text field labeled Y: and press Enter.
Your slice shifts up if you type in a lower number or down if you type in
a higher number.
Resizing a slice
Sometimes after you make a slice, you decide you need to resize the under-
lying image. After you resize the image, you want to resize the slice. You
may also need to resize a slice if you draw the slice quickly and don’t make
it big enough. As with moving a slice, resizing a slice can be done by clicking
and dragging or by typing new values.
To resize two dimensions of a slice at once using the click-and-drag method,
follow these steps:
1. Click a corner of the slice.
You must click a handle at one of the corners in order to resize the slice.
If you click anywhere inside the slice (except the exact center) and drag,
you move the slice instead of resizing it.

Creating and Editing Slices
294
2. Drag the handle on the corner of the slice to the desired new 
location.
If you only want to change the height, click and drag the top or bottom
border of the slice. If you only want to change the width, click and drag the
left or right border of the slice. Note that when your cursor is over the
border, it changes into the Resize cursor, two parallel lines with an arrow
pointing outward from each line, as shown in Figure 6-3.
When you’re creating slices, their edges snap to edges of already created
slices, so you may find it difficult to get the edge of a slice where you want
it. You can zoom in until you reach a magnification at which you can resize the
slice so it doesn’t snap to the edge of the other slice, or you can use the text
fields in the Property inspector to change the selected slice’s dimensions.
To resize a slice by typing new values, follow these steps:
1. Select the slice by clicking it on the canvas or in the Layers panel.
The Property inspector changes to give you access to the slice’s 
parameters.
2. If you want to change the slice’s width, type a new numerical value in
the text field labeled W: and press Enter.
If you increase the width, you add pixels to the right side of the slice.
If you decrease the width, you take pixels away from the right side of
the slice.
3. If you want to change the slice’s height, type a new numerical value
in the text field labeled H: and press Enter.
If you increase the height, you add pixels to the bottom of the slice. If
you decrease the height, you take pixels away from the bottom of
the slice.

Duplicating a slice
If you have a series of buttons, each of which is to be the same width and
height, you can make one slice and duplicate it as many times as you need.
Of course, you also need to move each duplicated slice to overlay a different
button and name each slice according to the button it overlays. To duplicate
a slice, just follow these steps:
1. Select the slice by clicking it on the canvas or in the Layers panel.
2. Choose Edit➪Duplicate or use the key command Ctrl+Alt+D.
A duplicate slice appears on top of, but slightly offset from, the slice you
duplicated.
If you clone the slice instead of duplicating it (Edit➪Clone or
Ctrl+Shift+D), the new slice appears directly on top of the old one.
You can also copy and paste a slice, though that’s essentially the same
as cloning, except that it takes an extra step!
3. Move the slice to its proper location.
See the “Moving a slice” section, earlier in this chapter, for instructions.
Optimizing Your Images for the Web
In order to understand the process of optimization, you need to know about
image compression. When you compress an image, you reduce its file size
by reducing the amount of data in the file. The two main types of image com-
pression are
✦Lossy: Some data is discarded from the image to make the file smaller.
✦Lossless: The data in the image is described in a more efficient way,
which makes the file smaller.
The two main compression methods used to format images for the Web are
✦JPEG: A lossy method, best used for photographs, gradients, and other
complex, variegated images.
✦GIF: A generally lossless method, best used for images with large areas
of flat color, like company logos. It also allows for images with transpar-
ent backgrounds.
Not sure which compression method to use for a particular slice? That’s
where the Preview panes come in. You can use a Preview pane any time you

Optimizing Your Images for the Web
296
have slices. They show you what the image will look like at your chosen
compression setting (or settings). See the section, “Previewing Slices,” later
in this chapter, for the details.
One way to deal with compression is to make a setting when you first make
the slice and make the fine adjustments later. It doesn’t really matter, though.
You can just leave each slice at the default setting until you’re ready to export.
Working with the options in the Optimize panel
By default, the Optimize panel resides at the top right of the Fireworks
window. If it’s not visible onscreen, choose Windows➪Optimize or press F6
to open it. Figure 6-4 shows the Optimize panel as it appears when it is
expanded and a slice is selected.
The top drop-down list displays a saved setting. A saved setting is a group
of optimization options that includes the export file format and options
appropriate to the selected export file format (read on to discover more
about the main export file formats — JPEG and GIF — and the options 
specific to each).
Under the Saved Settings drop-down list is the Export File Format drop-
down list. If you use a default setting from the Saved Settings drop-down
list above, Fireworks automatically shows the file format in the lower list.
Otherwise, you have to select the export file format. We only look at JPEGs
and GIFs, because they are by far the most common Web formats, but the
full list of file formats that Fireworks can export is noted in the sidebar,
“Other export file types.”
We discuss the options displayed in the Optimize panel in the following 
sections, “Making a JPEG” and “Making a GIF.” The Options button (the bul-
leted list icon) at the top right of the Optimize panel provides access to the
Options menu, which offers its own set of choices. The items in the Options

menu vary, depending on the file type you have selected in the Export File
Format drop-down list.
When you have JPEG selected, the Options menu offers the following:
✦Save Settings: This option allows you to preserve your current com-
pression setting as a preset, which you can then select from the Saved
Settings drop-down list in the Optimize panel. Presets (custom or not)
can be useful for batch processing images (automating the export of 
multiple images that use the same settings).
✦Delete Settings: This option does what you would expect — it deletes
your custom compression settings.
This option deletes all the settings.
✦Optimize to Size: This handy option allows you to set a target file size
for your slice. Fireworks then makes the appropriate compression 
settings to produce a file of your specified size.
✦Export Wizard: The Export Wizard walks you through the steps of
exporting an image with a series of dialog boxes.
✦Progressive JPEG: If you have this option selected when you export a
slice, your JPEG will contain two versions of your image. The first is a
low-resolution version of the image that loads relatively quickly to a
browser. The second, which fills in over the first, is a higher-resolution
version. Although the time it takes for this type of image to become 
visible is shorter, the overall download time is longer.
If your JPEG needs to be large (in terms of width and height) and high-
quality, you should consider exporting it as a progressive JPEG.
Macromedia Flash cannot dynamically import progressive JPEGs.
✦Sharpen JPEG Edges: Select this option if image clarity is a priority (if,
for example, you have small text in the image). Note that clarity makes
for larger file sizes.
✦Show Swatch Feedback, Load Palette, Save Palette: These options
apply to 8-bit graphics (including GIFs; JPEGs are a 24-bit format).
Custom palettes are sets of colors to which you can limit images.
See your documentation for further details.
✦Help, Group Optimize With, Close Panel Group: These options don’t
relate to JPEGs per se. See Book III, Chapter 1 for more information
about general panel options.
When you have GIF selected from the Export File Format drop-down list, the
Options menu makes some JPEG-specific options unavailable but offers the
following GIF-specific (8-bit graphic specific) options:

Optimizing Your Images for the Web
298
✦Interlaced: An interlaced GIF is similar to a progressive JPEG. A low-
resolution version of the graphic loads first (and fast), and the image
slowly transitions until it is at its maximum resolution. As with progres-
sive JPEGs, the image loads faster initially, but the final version of the
image doesn’t load as quickly as it would if it weren’t interlaced. (You
can also export an interlaced PNG.)
✦Remove Unused Colors: When this option is selected, as it is by default,
Fireworks removes any color from the image’s palette that isn’t used by
the image. Smaller palettes mean smaller file sizes.
Under the Optimize panel name is the Saved Settings drop-down list,
which offers seven default settings (two for JPEGs and five for GIFs).
You can choose between two default settings for JPEGs:
• JPEG — Better Quality: Makes a high-quality image, which results in
a bigger file size and a longer download time.
• JPEG — Smaller File: Makes a small file, with a corresponding loss
in image quality.
For information about the default GIF settings, see the section, “Making a
GIF,” later in this chapter.
The rest of the parameters in the Optimize panel vary based on what export
file format you choose, so we discuss them in the following sections in the
context of how to export JPEGs and GIFs.
Making a JPEG
Because JPEG is a lossy compression method, you will want a fair amount of
control over just how much data gets discarded from your image. The
higher the amount of compression, the lower the image quality — but also
the smaller the file size and consequently the faster the download time.
Fireworks gives you a few options so you can maximize image quality while
minimizing file size.
Using the default JPEG settings
To use a default setting is easy. Just follow these steps:
1. Select the slice by clicking it on the canvas or in the Layers panel.
2. Select either JPEG — Better Quality or JPEG — Smaller File from the
Settings drop-down list in the Optimize panel.
The Image Type, Quality, and Smoothing drop-down lists update accord-
ing to your chosen setting. You can further refine these settings if you
like, as outlined in the following section.

Book III
Chapter 6

299
Using custom JPEG settings
To make or edit a custom JPEG setting, follow these steps:
1. Select the slice by clicking it on the canvas or in the Layers panel.
2. Select JPEG from the Export File Format drop-down list in the
Optimize panel.
3. Type a number in the Quality text field or use the slider (click the
button next to the text field with the downward-pointing arrow to
activate the slider) to set the image quality.
You can enter any whole number from 0 to 100, with 0 representing the
lowest quality and 100 the highest.
If part of your image needs to be a higher quality than the rest, follow
the next set of instructions, which describe using the Selective
Quality option.
4. Set the smoothing, if necessary.
Smoothing blurs the image a little, reducing its quality but also reducing
its file size. You can type or select any whole number from 1 through 8,
with 1 representing the least blurring and 8 representing the most 
blurring. If you don’t want smoothing, leave it at its default setting, 0.
The Selective Quality option in the Optimize panel allows you to compress
different parts of your image by different amounts. In some cases, using
Selective Quality can be a great alternative to cutting a photograph into 
different slices set at different compression levels.
Other export file types
Fireworks can export these other image types
in addition to JPEGs and GIFs:
 PNG: The native file format for Fireworks is
PNG. You should be aware that Fireworks
stores extra information in PNGs that is not
available to other applications opening the
same file. PNGs can have transparent
backgrounds and can be viewed in some
browsers. PNG is a Macromedia Flash-
friendly format.
 WBMP: A 2-bit format (black and white only)
created especially for wireless devices,
such as PDAs and cell phones.
 TIFF: This format is often used for print
materials.
 BMP: Bitmap is the native image format 
for PCs.
Fireworks on the Macintosh can export an
image in the Mac-native image format, PICT.

Here’s how to use the Selective Quality option:
1. Click the Original button at the top left of the canvas if you are not
already viewing the Original pane.
2. Use a Selection tool to select the area of the image that you want to
compress differently than the rest of the image.
Make sure you’re in the Original view, not in a Preview pane.
3. Choose Modify➪Selective JPEG➪Save Selection as JPEG Mask.
Your JPEG mask shows up as a pink overlay.
4. Select JPEG from the drop-down list in the Optimize panel, if it’s not
already selected.
5. Click the Selective Quality button (the pencil and paper) in the
Optimize panel.
The Selective JPEG Settings dialog box, shown in Figure 6-5, appears.
6. Make sure the Enable Selective Quality check box is selected in the
Selective JPEG Settings dialog box (it is checked by default).
7. Type a number from 0 to 100 in the text field.
Zero represents the lowest quality; 100 represents the highest quality.
This number should, of course, be different from the number in the
Quality field discussed previously.
8. Change the overlay color if you don’t like the default overlay color.
The overlay color does not affect the exported image.
9. Select the Preserve Text Quality check box if you want to preserve
the quality of any text within your selection, regardless of the overall
compression settings.

10. Select the Preserve Button Quality check box if you want to preserve
the quality of any buttons within your selection, regardless of the
overall compression settings.
11. Click OK or press Enter.
Making a GIF
Okay, when we said the GIF compression method is generally lossless, we
meant this: You can make lossless GIFs, but you can also make lossy GIFs if
you need to. GIFs compress image data in a couple of ways:
✦By keeping track of the data more efficiently: GIFs group adjacent
pixels of the same color in each row of the image so the pixels can be
described as a group instead of as individual pixels. The fewer colors
you have in each row, and the more pixels of the same color are
together in a line, the better GIF compression works.
✦By limiting the number of colors in an image: You can create custom
palettes (sets of colors) or use the specialized built-in palettes that
Fireworks offers. If you compress your image with a palette that doesn’t
contain all the colors in the image, Fireworks substitutes colors from
the palette, effectively reducing the number of colors in the GIF as com-
pared to the source image.
Sometimes you can simulate the appearance of the lost color by dither-
ing two colors from the palette. The section on Web safe colors in Book
III, Chapter 2 has more about dithering.
Using the default GIF settings
Fireworks offers several default Saved Settings for GIFs (available from the
Saved Settings drop-down list at the top of the Optimize panel):
✦GIF Web 216: This setting limits the colors in your GIF to the basic Web
safe palette.
✦GIF Web Snap 256: This setting limits the number of colors in your GIF
to 256, while snapping any colors close in appearance to Web safe
colors to the Web safe palette.
✦GIF Web Snap 128: This setting limits the colors in your GIF to 128,
while snapping any colors close in appearance to Web safe colors to the
Web safe palette.
✦GIF Adaptive 256: This setting limits the colors in your GIF to the 256
most common in the GIF. Other colors are changed to the closest color

in the palette. This setting will give you the highest fidelity GIF version
of your image.
✦Animated GIF Web Snap 128: This setting is the same as GIF Web Snap
128, but for animated GIFs.
Using custom GIF settings
To make a basic GIF that doesn’t use a Fireworks default setting, just follow
these steps:
1. Select a slice by clicking it on the canvas or in the Layers panel.
2. Select GIF from the Export File Format drop-down list in the Optimize
panel, which is shown in Figure 6-6.
The Optimize panel, shown in Figure 6-6, displays the setting for a top
navigation button. Note that transparency appears as a checkerboard
pattern in the palette. Note also that because this is a custom setting,
the Saved Settings field is blank.
3. Set the compression mode by selecting one from the Indexed Palette
drop-down list (right below the Export File Format drop-down list).
Palettes are sets of colors. For GIFs, the palettes may contain no more
than 256 colors. For Web images, choose from the top four:
• Adaptive
• Web Adaptive
• Web 216
• Exact
For more information about these palettes, see the Fireworks Help files.

4. Type a number in the Colors text field or use the drop-down list to set
the number of colors in your palette, if you’re not compressing using
the Web 216 or Exact settings.
The fewer colors you have in your palette, the smaller the file size of
your image. If you have fewer colors in the palette than in your image,
however, Fireworks must substitute colors, deteriorating image quality.
If your image has more than 256 colors, you may get better results using
a JPEG setting.
5. If there are more colors in your image than in your palette, and if you
prefer dithering to straight one-for-one color substitutions, type a per-
cent in the Dither text field or use the slider (click the button next to
the text field with the downward-pointing arrow to activate the
slider) to set a percentage from 1 to 96.
The more you dither, the fewer colors you need in your palette.
Unfortunately, dithering can look bad up close and increases the
file size.
Making a transparent GIF
To make a GIF with transparent areas, which allows the HTML page back-
ground color or background image to show through, follow these steps:
1. Select a slice by clicking it on the canvas or in the Layers panel.
2. Select GIF from the Export File Format drop-down list in the Optimize
panel, if GIF is not already selected.
3. Select Index Transparency from the Transparency drop-down list.
The default is No Transparency. Even when you don’t have a back-
ground in your PNG file, you still need to select Index Transparency to
make a GIF with transparent pixels.
4. Click the eyedropper button with the equal sign (=) to select a color
in the palette or on the canvas that you want to make transparent.
The three transparency eyedropper buttons are at the bottom left of the
Optimize panel. The selected color becomes transparent in the palette
in the Optimize panel. If you’re viewing a Preview pane, the transparency
will appear (or disappear, as it were) on the canvas.
5. Use the eyedropper with the plus sign (+) to select additional colors to
make transparent, if desired.
You can use the eyedropper with the minus sign (–) to restore opacity
to a color that has been made transparent, if necessary.

Previewing Slices
304
Previewing Slices
You can optimize your slices as you make them, or you can make all your
slices first and then optimize them all at once. Either way, if you’re having
trouble deciding on the best method or amount of compression to use on
a slice, you can use one of the three Preview panes to help you make an
informed decision. Just click one of the following buttons at the top of the
canvas:
✦Preview: This view shows a single version of your canvas, where you
can see what your slices will look like and how big their files sizes will
be at your current compression settings. Click a slice to preview it.
✦2-Up: This view puts two versions of your canvas side-by-side, so you
can compare the original image with a compressed version of the image,
or you can compare two compressed versions to each other. Click a
slice on either side to preview it on both sides.
✦4-Up: This view divides the work area into quadrants, so you can com-
pare three compression settings at once to the original image. Click a
slice in any quadrant to preview the settings in all quadrants.
In the Preview panes, slices that are not currently selected look slightly
pale, as if viewed through a fogged-up window. Selected slices look as they
will when exported, given their current settings (including transparencies,
which appear as checkerboards), as shown in Figure 6-7.

The Preview pane
You can select the Preview pane by clicking the Preview button at the top
left of the image’s window, right above the canvas.
The Preview pane previews more than just the appearance of your image; it
also shows you the image’s projected file size and the amount of time it
would take for a file that size to download at a particular download speed.
(The default is 56 Kbps, or the approximate speed of a dial-up modem.)
In Figure 6-7, you can see the file size, export file format and download time
stats at the bottom left, below the canvas. Because a 56 Kbps modem can
download at a rate of 5K per second, and this image is a little over 0.5K, the
download time shows as 0 sec (less than 1 second).
When you change the settings in the Optimize panel, the size and download
time information at the bottom of the Preview pane update automatically.
The Optimize panel works the same way, whether you’re looking at a
Preview pane or the default Original pane.
The 2-Up view
You can select the 2-Up view simply by clicking the 2-Up button at the top
left of the image’s window, above the canvas.
The 2-Up view sets two versions of the canvas side by side. At the bottom
of each pane is an indicator of which view is in the pane and some of its
vital statistics. In Figure 6-8, the pane on the right shows what the image
would look like as a JPEG with the settings as shown at the bottom of the
pane, and the pane on the left shows what the image would look like if
exported as a GIF with the settings as shown at the bottom of the pane.
You can click in either pane to select the slice, and then adjust its settings
in the Optimize panel. You can set the magnification of both panes several
ways:
✦You can use the Magnifying tool in the View section of the Tools panel.
✦You can choose Zoom In, Zoom Out, or a preset Magnification setting
from the View menu.
✦You can select a zoom setting from the drop-down list at the bottom-right
of the window.
To toggle between an optimized setting and the original image, click the
indented button at the left just below the canvas. A pop-up menu allows
you to select Original (No Preview) or Export Preview.

Previewing Slices
306
You can use the Hand tool from the View section of the Tools panel to move
the canvas (select the Hand tool and then click and drag on the canvas), or
just hold down the Space bar while you click and drag (whatever tool you’re
using becomes the Hand tool automatically). When you move the canvas in
one pane, the canvas also moves in the other pane.
To select a different slice than the one currently selected, click the Pointer
tool from the Tools panel, and then click a slice in either pane or in the
Layers panel. The slice becomes active in both panes simultaneously.
The 4-Up view
You can select the 4-Up view by clicking the 4-Up button at the top left
above the canvas. When you first open the 4-Up view, the top-left quadrant
displays the Original view, and the other three panes have identical com-
pression settings. To change the settings in one pane, click in the pane to
select it, and then change its settings in the Optimize panel. In fact, the con-
cept, properties, and processes of using the 4-Up view are identical to those
of the 2-Up view; you just get two extra panes.
Figure 6-9 shows the 4-Up view. Comparing the three compression settings,
it seems the one that best balances visual quality with file size is the GIF
pane at the bottom right.

Relating Hotspots and Slices
307
Relating Hotspots and Slices
Slices can only be rectangular, which is fine if your buttons are rectangular.
But what if you want to create non-rectangular HTML links to other Web
pages? You have two choices:
✦Use the Polygon Slice tool to make a polygonal slice. This works best
if the area that you want to use as a hyperlink is fairly isolated from
other slices. See Book III, Chapter 5 for details.
✦Use a Hotspot tool to draw hotspots on an image. Fireworks will create
the underlying image plus what is known as an image map. An image
map is some HTML code representing coordinates for hyperlinked
polygonal hotspots. Hotspots are areas on an image that have been
coded to respond to user actions.
Typically, the hotspots are hyperlinked to Web pages. In Figure 6-10, the
bowling ball could be linked to a page about bowling balls, while the pin
could be linked to a page with a list of bowling alleys. Hotspots are great,
but use them sparingly so you don’t add too much code to your HTML or
tax the user’s processor with too many instructions.

If that all sounds too technical, don’t worry. You don’t need to know all the
ins and outs of HTML to make an image map — Fireworks takes care of that
for you. All you have to do is create hotspots in the shapes you want, and
export HTML with your images. See Book III, Chapter 7 for details.
Exporting Images
You can export images in two ways: one by one or all at once. You can have
Fireworks generate HTML at the same time as you export your images, or
you can export the images only and write the code yourself in Dreamweaver.
(The code Fireworks generates is less efficient and more difficult to edit
than code you would write in Dreamweaver.)
Exporting a single image
To export a single image, follow these steps:
1. Right-click a slice and select Export Selected Slice from the contextual
menu.
An Export dialog box appears, with default values set for exporting a
single image.
2. Navigate to the folder into which you want to put your image.
3. Leave the Save as Type setting at the default, Images Only.

7. Click the Save button.
Exporting multiple image slices
To export all the image slices in a PNG file at once, if you plan to write the
HTML yourself, follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪Export or use the key command Ctrl+Shift+R.
The Export dialog box appears, with default values set for exporting
multiple images and HTML, as shown in Figure 6-11.
2. Select Images Only from the Save as Type drop-down list.
The options below the Save as Type drop-down list update to reflect
your selection.
3. Leave the Slices setting at the default, Export Slices.
4. Deselect the Include Areas without Slices check box if you need only
the sliced images to build your HMTL page.

5. If you have rollover images that you want to export, make sure that
the Current Frame Only check box is deselected.
Remember, it takes multiple frames to make rollover images. 
6. Click the Save button.
Exporting an animated GIF
When you export an animated GIF, you’ll notice that beyond the default Images
Only option in the Save as Type drop-down list, there’s also a Macromedia
Flash SWF option. Although that option does allow you to make some addi-
tional settings, chances are that if the ultimate format of the animation is to
be an SWF file instead of a GIF file, you would be better off opening the PNG
file in Macromedia Flash and exporting from there. Why? Because Macromedia
Flash offers more powerful authoring and editing tools, many more export
parameters than Fireworks, and ActionScript for adding complex inter-
activity to your animation.
To export an animation as an animated GIF (not a Flash SWF movie), follow
these simple steps:
1. Make sure you have selected Animated GIF in the Optimize panel’s
Export File Format drop-down list.
2. Choose File➪Export or use the key command Ctrl+Shift+R.
The Export dialog box appears, with default values set for exporting 
animated GIFs.
3. Navigate to the folder into which you would like the GIF to go.
4. Leave the default Images Only setting in the Save as Type drop-down
list.
5. Click Save.
There’s lots more to the Export function than we’ve outlined in this section.
For information on exporting HTML and other export options, see the sec-
tion about advanced export functions in Book III, Chapter 7.

F
ireworks MX 2004, like all the applications in the Macromedia Studio
MX 2004 suite, is deep and rich. In this chapter, we introduce some of
the application’s more advanced capabilities, such as the following:
✦Exporting HTML code with JavaScript. (JavaScript is a coding language
that you can use to make elements of your Web page change based on
user feedback, among other things.) If you have added behaviors to
your Fireworks PNG, you’ve added JavaScript to the HTML that
Fireworks will generate.
✦Creating image maps with hotspots.
✦Setting up button behaviors that go beyond simple rollovers. (See
Book III, Chapter 5 for instructions on how to create simple button
rollovers.)
✦Using the Image Swap behavior to make an image on your Web page
change when the user rolls over a separate image.
Using Advanced Export Options
In Book III, Chapter 6, we describe how to export images, but not how to
export HTML or other types of files. If you’re designing a Web page and you
have behaviors or hotspots in your Fireworks PNG file, you will want to
export HTML along with your images, because the HTML and JavaScript
code make hotspots and behaviors work in Web pages.
The first step in exporting any type of file from Fireworks is to choose
File➪Export or press Ctrl+Shift+R to bring up the Export dialog box, shown
in Figure 7-1. The Save as Type drop-down list in the Export dialog box offers
access to an array of extra options:

Using Advanced Export Options
312
✦HTML and Images: Exports HTML (or other Web language) code as well
as images.
✦Images Only: Exports images at your chosen optimization settings.
✦Dreamweaver Library (.lbi): Exports Library items as well as images.
(Library items are snippets of HTML code you can use in Dreamweaver
to make site maintenance easier.)
✦CSS Layers (.htm): Allows you to export layers, frames, or slices as
Cascading Style Sheet layers, so Fireworks generates both images and
CSS-based HTML code, placing each layer, frame, or slice in its own CSS
layer (for information about working with CSS layers in Dreamweaver,
see Book II, Chapter 5).
✦Director (.htm): Exports either layers or frames as images that can be
imported into Macromedia Director MX for use in Shockwave movies.
(Director is not part of the Macromedia Studio suite.)
✦Layers to Files: Exports each layer in the current frame as a separate
image file, which can be useful if you’re planning to use the layers to
build an animation in another application.
✦Frames to Files: Exports each frame as a separate image file, which can
be useful if you’re planning to use the frames to build an animation in
another application.
✦Lotus Domino Designer: Exports either the top four layers, the top four
frames, or the first four frames of each slice as separate files. Domino is
an IBM Web application server/collaboration tool.

✦Macromedia Flash SWF: Exports an SWF file, which can be viewed via
the Flash browser plug-in and imported into Macromedia Flash.
Macromedia Flash is a much more flexible authoring tool for SWFs.
✦Illustrator 7: Exports either the current frame, leaving layers intact,
or exports a document in which frames have been converted to layers.
Illustrator is a design program from Adobe (the company that also
makes Photoshop).
✦Photoshop PSD: Exports the PNG as a layered Photoshop document
(PSD). You can choose to maintain editability of text layers and effects,
which may result in variations in appearance between the two files, or
to maintain the appearance by giving up editability of text and effects.
Remember, your PNG’s Web layer won’t be exported.
Although you may want to export any of these types of files, in this section
we focus on the HTML and Images option, which is the one that you’re likely
to use most often.
Readying your PNG for HTML export
If you’re using Fireworks to generate your HTML code, chances are you have
buttons in your design that you want linked to other pages on your site. Or
perhaps you have one or more hotspots in your PNG, and you want those
hotspots to link to other pages on your Web site. Naturally, Fireworks makes it
easy for you to add URLs to create the hyperlinks for buttons and hotspots.
All you need to do is plan ahead: You should have HTML document names for
all the pages to which you want to link from your current page.
To add a URL to an existing slice or hotspot in the document’s Web layer
(see Book III, Chapter 6 for information on creating slices), just follow
these steps:
1. Select the slice or hotspot by clicking it on the canvas or in the Layers
panel (if necessary, open the Layers panel by pressing F2 and/or
expand the panel by clicking the panel name).
The Property inspector is updated to show information about the
selected slice or hotspot.
2. Click in the Link text field in the Property inspector.
If you have added links to other slices or other hotspots, those links
appear as drop-down list choices in the Link text field.
3. Type a URL.
If you are linking to a page on your own site and all your HTML pages
are in the same folder, simply type the name of the HTML document (for

Using Advanced Export Options
314
example, index.htm or help.htm). You must type the name of the 
document exactly as it appears. (If you type index.htm but your
home page is actually index.html, the link will not work.)
If you are linking to a page not on your site, include the complete URL
(such as http://catalog.dummies.com/booksanddownloads.asp).
4. Press Enter or click anywhere on the canvas.
Exporting HTML with your images
If you want, you can tell Fireworks to generate the HTML along with the 
optimized images for your Web page and let that be the end of it. If you plan
to make any changes to the HTML in Dreamweaver or another HTML editor,
however, you can set some options to control the way Fireworks sets up
tables in the HTML it generates, which can make your Web page mainte-
nance a little easier down the line.
To export HTML and images that you plan not to update, or that you plan to
update in Fireworks rather than Dreamweaver, follow these steps:
1. Set up a folder structure for your Web site on your hard drive.
You should have a master folder that holds every file for your site.
Inside the master folder, you may wish to put an images folder, which
can hold all your images, keeping them separate from the HTML docu-
ments. You can have your HTML documents and image files all mixed
together in the master folder, but if you have lots of images, you’ll find
the image files easier to locate and work with if you create a separate
folder for them.
2. Check to make sure all the right layers are visible (or not visible) in
your PNG file.
Remember, only visible layers and objects are included in the exported
image files.
3. In Fireworks, choose File➪Export or press Ctrl+Shift+R.
The Export dialog box appears.
4. Navigate to the Web site’s master folder.
If you haven’t created a master folder for your Web site, you can create
a folder by clicking the standard Windows Create New Folder icon to the
right of the Save In drop-down list.
5. Type a name for your page in the File Name text field if the default is
not what you want your HTML page to be named.
The default HTML file extension in the Macromedia Studio suite is .htm,
but .html is also acceptable.

6. Select HTML and Images from the Save as Type drop-down list.
The options below this drop-down list update to reflect your choice.
7. Select Export HTML File from the HTML drop-down list.
If you select Copy to Clipboard instead of Exporting HTML File, Fireworks
exports the code to a temporary location (your computer’s Clipboard),
from which the code can be pasted into an existing document. If you
select Copy to Clipboard, you can simply open any type of text docu-
ment and press Ctrl+V to paste the HTML into the file.
Export HTML File has myriad options available. See the upcoming sec-
tion, “Setting the export HTML file options,” for more information.
8. Select Export Slices from the Slices drop-down list.
If you haven’t made slices in your PNG file but you have placed guides
in the file, you can select the Slice Along Guides option, and Fireworks
cuts up your design based on the guides.
9. Leave the Current Frame Only check box deselected unless you have
multiple frames in your document, at least one of which you do not
want to export.
10. Leave the Include Areas without Slices option selected unless you
have a plan to deal with areas you didn’t slice.
If you’re using a background image, for example, or you want to use
transparent spacer GIFs, you may not need images from the nonsliced
areas — if there are any.
11. Select the Put Images in Subfolder check box if you want your images
to be exported to a folder inside your site’s master folder.
It’s important to decide when you export where your images are going
to live, because your HTML document will include links to the images.
The links will be expressed as pathnames to the images relative to the
location of the HTML document.
12. Click the Save button.
The HTML file is saved to your site’s master folder, and the images are
saved either to that same folder or to a folder within that folder, as
specified in Step 11.
Setting the export HTML file options
When you click the Options button in the Export dialog box, the HTML
Setup dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 7-2. In the HTML Setup dialog
box, you can view and modify the default settings that determine the struc-
ture of the exported HTML document.

Using Advanced Export Options
316
You can access settings on the three tabs in the HTML Setup dialog box:
✦General: Allows you to change the default HTML style — different
HTML editors have different styles of writing and displaying the code —
and file extension. With Fireworks MX 2004, the different kinds of code
include CFML, ASP, and more. You can also choose whether or not
Fireworks should put comments in the HTML document. (Comments are
notes in the HTML source code that typically contain information about
the structure of the code, such as <!— Left navigation starts
here —>. Comments are not displayed by the browser. If you want to be
able to launch and edit entire tables from Dreamweaver, be sure you’ve
selected the Include HTML Comments check box.) Select the Lowercase
File Name check box if you want to make the names of the HTML file
and all exported images all lowercase, even if you might have named
images with uppercase and lowercase letters in your PNG.
✦Table: Allows you to customize the way Fireworks sets up tables. The
default is that Fireworks puts a one-pixel high spacer row at the top and
a one-pixel wide spacer column on the right to hold the design in place.
You can choose to have Fireworks nest tables (put one table inside
another) instead. You can also tell Fireworks to recreate parts of your
design that lack objects as cells with background-transparent spacer
GIFs in the HTML, to leave the cell empty, or put in a non-breaking
space. A spacer GIF is a one-pixel by one-pixel transparent image that
you can set to any height and width in your HTML to hold open an 
otherwise empty table cell.
✦Document Specific: Allows you to customize image naming based on
table structure and/or image function. For example, for slices with mul-
tiple frames, Fireworks appends _f2, _f3, and so on, to the filename. If
the images from Frame 2 of your PNG are buttons in their rollover state,
you may prefer to have Fireworks append -o or -over to the filename. If
you want all images to have identical Alt tags, enter the desired word or

phrase in the Default ALT tag text field. If your PNG file contains a Nav
Bar Image (see the “Creating advanced button rollovers” section, later in
this chapter), you can select the Export Multiple Nav Bar HTML Files
check box if you want Fireworks to generate separate HTML files for
each button in the navigation bar. The Include Areas without Slice
Objects check box is selected by default; leave it selected for most con-
sistent results. Select the UTF-8 Encoding check box if you want to use
multiple character sets (Hebrew and English, for example) in your HTML.
The Set Defaults button on the Document Specific tab allows you to save
any new settings you make, which is particularly useful if you like to use a
specific naming convention for button rollovers and on states. When you
adjust the Document Specific settings to your liking and click the Set
Defaults button, your adjusted settings become the new default Document
Specific settings.
Setting Up Image Maps and Button Rollovers
Fireworks writes image maps and JavaScript into the HTML code you
export, provided that you have hotspots (which Fireworks uses to make
image maps) or behaviors (which Fireworks uses to make JavaScript) in
your PNG. The following two sections outline how to set up image maps
(which allow you to make several distinct hyperlinks from a single image)
and complex button behaviors (which make the button image change based
on a user action like rolling the mouse over the image or clicking the image).
Fireworks can show slices and hotspots overlapping, but you should be
careful not to overlap either. Fireworks will not export any part of a slice
that’s under another slice. (The slice on top includes the overlapped area;
the slice underneath is cut off.) Likewise, whichever hotspot is on top in the
Layers panel overrides the hotspot underneath.
Creating image maps with hotspots
The three hotspot tools allow you to create hotspots shaped like rectangles,
circles, or polygons. You can also use the Polygon Slice tool to create a
hotspot, though as a rule you should use the hotspot tools unless you are
making a single, isolated hotspot. (For more information on the Polygon
Slice tool, see Book III, Chapter 6.)
To create a circular or rectangular hotspot using a hotspot tool, just follow
these steps:
1. Select a hotspot tool from the Web section of the Tools panel.
Click and hold on the Rectangle Hotspot tool to access the pop-up menu
containing the Circle Hotspot tool, if necessary.

Setting Up Image Maps and Button Rollovers
318
2. Click and drag over the area you want to become a hotspot.
3. Type a URL in the Link text field in the Property inspector and
press Enter.
You can add URLs as you make the hotspots, or you can create all of
your hotspots and then select each one and add a URL in the Property
inspector.
4. Make more hotspots as needed.
When you create hotspots using the Polygon Slice tool, you’re actually
making rectangular images with linked areas inside. As a result, Fireworks
makes a separate image map for each slice. That’s fine if you’re only making
one polygonal slice, but if you’re making several adjacent hotspots, you’re
better off using the Polygon Hotspot tool or making your image map in
Dreamweaver. (See Book III, Chapter 6 for information about how to use the
Polygon Slice tool.)
Making a polygonal hotspot is only a little bit more involved than making a
rectangular or circular hotspot. To make a polygonal hotspot, just follow
these steps:
1. Select the Polygon Hotspot tool from the Web section of the Tools
panel.
Click and hold on the Rectangle Hotspot tool to access the pop-up menu
containing the Polygon Hotspot tool.
2. Click on the canvas to establish the first point of your polygon.
3. Click on a second point.
Fireworks draws a line connecting the points.
4. Continue to click until you have drawn the shape you want.
You don’t need to click again on the first point to close the shape. Be
aware that the more points you make, the more code is required to
reproduce your hotspot as an image map, so you may want to avoid
making hotspots that have more than six or seven points. Note how the
polygonal hotspot for the bowling pin in Figure 7-3 sacrifices perfect
coverage of the pin to make a simpler shape, which means less code.
5. Type a URL in the Link text field in the Property inspector and
press Enter.
You can add URLs as you make the hotspots, or you can create all of
your hotspots and then select each one and add a URL in the Property
inspector.

6. Click the Polygon hotspot tool and then deselect the last hotspot you
made by using the key command Ctrl+D or choosing Select➪Deselect.
Deselecting ensures that you won’t inadvertently add an extra point to
your Polygon hotspot.
When it comes time to export your images, you need to export HTML as
well as images in order to get the image map that Fireworks makes from
your hotspots. See the “Exporting HTML with your images” section, earlier
in this chapter, for more details.
Dreamweaver has its own tool for creating hotspots and image maps. You
can also use that tool to edit hotspots and image maps generated by
Fireworks. See Book II, Chapter 7 for more details.
Creating advanced button rollovers
In Book III, Chapter 5, we discuss how to use frames in conjunction with text
and drawing tools to make the images (one per frame for each button) for a
simple button rollover, which provides all the information you need if you
plan to use Dreamweaver to generate the rollover code.

Setting Up Image Maps and Button Rollovers

If you want to export the rollover code for a two-state button (normal and
rollover/highlight) from Fireworks, you need to add a behavior to the slice
by taking these steps:
1. Right-click the slice for which you want to create rollover code, or
select the slice and click the behavior handle (the round icon) in the
center of the selected slice.
A contextual menu appears.
2. Choose Add Simple Rollover.
A second way to add rollover behavior to a button is to use the Behavior
panel:
1. If the Behavior panel is not currently open, choose Window➪
Behaviors or use the keyboard shortcut Shift+F3.
2. Click the Add Behavior (+) button at the top left of the Behaviors
panel.
A menu appears.
3. Choose Simple Rollover from the menu.
You have set up a behavior that swaps the image in Frame 1 with the image
in Frame 2 when a user rolls a cursor over the button on your Web page.
The behavior also swaps the image back when the user moves the cursor off
the button.
If you want to check out your rollover in action without building your Web
page, click the Preview button at the top of the canvas and move your
cursor over the slice.
Your button can have up to four states. Fireworks uses the image in Frame 1
for the normal, default state, Frame 2 for the Rollover state, Frame 3 for the
Down state, and Frame 4 for the Over While Down state. If you want to
include a down state for your button, and you have a third frame in your
PNG with the image for an additional button state, follow the preceding
steps to add a rollover state, and then do the following:
1. Click the Add Behavior button at the top left of the Behaviors panel.
A menu appears.
2. Choose Set Nav Bar Image from the menu.
The Set Nav Bar Image dialog box appears.

Book III
Chapter 7
Advanced
Fireworks MX 
2004 Tools
Setting Up Image Maps and Button Rollovers

3. Click OK.
Now, when a user clicks the button in your exported HMTL, the button
will change from the rollover state to the down state.
Figure 7-4 shows what the Behaviors panel looks like after you add the
Simple Rollover and Set Nav Bar Image behaviors. You can use the add
behavior (+) button to add a behavior and use the minus (–) button to
remove a behavior from a slice.
If the three-state button is linking to another page, adding a down state
doesn’t give you much bang for your buck because the linked page may
appear in the browser window before the user even has a chance to notice
that the button changed.
You may want to include an over-while-down state for your button (sort of
an extra rollover) if you are using the down state of the button to indicate
the current page. If so, make sure you have a fourth frame with the image for
an extra button state, add the Rollover and Set Nav Bar Image behaviors as
discussed previously, and then do the following:
1. Double-click the Set Nav Bar Image line in the Behaviors panel.
The Set Nav Bar Image dialog box appears.
2. Select the Include Over While Down State (Frame 4) check box.
If the button is for the current page, select the Show Down Image upon
Load check box as well.
3. Click OK.
Remember to select the Export Multiple Nav Bar HTML Files check box
on the Document Specific tab of the HTML Setup dialog box if you want
Fireworks to generate separate HTML files for each button in the nav
bar (see the “Setting the export HTML file options” section, earlier in
this chapter, for more information).

Fireworks can generate JavaScript that does more than merely change the
state of a button. For instance, you can set a behavior that swaps one image
for another image elsewhere on the page when you roll over a button or
hotspot. You can also use Fireworks to generate pop-up menus.
The Swap Images behavior
A button rollover is an image swap — you swap the image for one button
state with the image for another state. But you can roll over a button and
have a different image on the page swap. For example, you could set up a
rollover behavior for two or more buttons to show different color choices
for a product, so that when the user rolls over a button for color choices,
the image of the product changes to show the appropriately colored ver-
sion. If you want the image swap and page download to be pretty quick, 
you should limit the number of images to be swapped and limit the file size
of each swapped image.
To add the Swap Image behavior to a trigger slice and target slice, create the
frames, images, and slices, and then follow these steps:
1. Click the slice that you want to use to trigger the image swap.
You can click the slice either on the canvas or in the Layers panel.
2. Click the Add Behavior (+) button at the top left of the Behaviors
panel (if the Behaviors panel isn’t visible, press Shift+F3 on your 
keyboard).
A menu appears.
3. Choose Swap Image.
The Swap Image dialog box, shown in Figure 7-5, appears.
4. Select the targeted slice by clicking its name (in the box on the left) or
by clicking its representation (in the box on the right).
When you click in either box, both boxes update to show your selection.
5. Using the Frame No. drop-down list, select the frame number the
rollover should trigger.
The drop-down list shows all the frames in your PNG file.
You can also select the Image File radio button and navigate to an exist-
ing image file outside your PNG to swap in. Be aware, though, that for
the rollover to work correctly in all browsers, the default target image
and swapped target image must be the same height and width.

6. Leave the Preload Images and the Restore Image onMouseOut check
boxes selected.
Preloading the swapped image ensures there won’t be a delay the first
time the user rolls over the button that triggers the swap. The trade-off
is that the Web page takes longer to load initially.
Restoring the image to default prevents the swapped image from “stick-
ing.” If you want the swapped image to remain in place until the user rolls
over another button, deselect the Restore Image onMouseOut check box.
7. Click OK.
A line on the canvas from the center of the trigger slice to the target
slice shows that one slice triggers a behavior in the other, as shown in
Figure 7-6.

You can have multiple buttons trigger a rollover in the same slice, and you
can have a single button trigger rollovers in multiple slices. Of course, the
more big rollovers you have on the page, the longer the page takes to load.
On the other hand, rollovers provide useful feedback (and instant gratifica-
tion) to the user, and Fireworks makes producing them a snap.
Generating pop-up menus
Pop-up menus are a great way to cram a lot of navigation into a small 
space because they only appear when a user rolls over a button or hotspot.
Fireworks allows you to specify many of the parameters of the menus’ appear-
ance. To start with, you can choose whether the links in your pop-up menus
are made of text or images. In a nutshell, that choice boils down to this:
✦Linked text: This option ensures faster download but less control over
the appearance of the text, because the text is HMTL.
✦Linked images: This option makes for a slower download but gives you
more control over the appearance of the text, because the text is
graphic.
You can also customize the position of the menu relative to the slice that
triggers it, the color of the text and cell background for both normal and
rollover states, and more. In fact, there are so many options, we can’t cover
them all here! After you’ve got the basics, though, you’ll be poised to
explore all the options, if you so desire.
To make a basic one-level pop-up menu with linked text, follow these steps:
1. Select a slice by clicking it on the canvas or in the Layers panel (if
necessary, open the Layers panel by pressing F2 and/or expand the
panel by clicking the panel name).
2. Click the Add Behavior (+) button at the top left of the Behaviors
panel (if the Behaviors panel is not visible, press Shift+F3).
A pop-up menu appears.
3. Choose Set Pop-up Menu from the Add Behaviors pop-up menu.
The Pop-up Menu Editor, shown in Figure 7-7, appears, with the Content
tab active by default.
4. Click under the Text column of the Pop-up Menu Editor and type the
text as you would like it to appear in your menu.
5. Press Tab or click under the Link column of the Pop-up Menu Editor
and type or select the URL or filename for the page you want your
text to link to.

If you have any existing links already on your page, they appear in a
drop-down list in the Link column.
6. If you want the link to open in a new window or different frameset,
tab over to or click in the Target column to set the target for the link.
If you simply want the linked page to open in the user’s current browser
window, leave this column blank, as shown in Figure 7-7. For information
on other Target options, see the discussion of links in Book II, Chapter 2,
or the discussion of framesets in Book II, Chapter 6.
7. Repeat Steps 4 through 6 for each item in your menu.
You can add rows to the list of menu items by clicking the Add Menu
button (the plus sign at the top left), or by pressing the Tab key until a
text field appears in the Text column.
8. Click the Next button at the bottom of the Pop-up Menu Editor.
The Appearance tab becomes active.
9. For the Cells option, make sure the HTML radio button (the default
selection) is selected.
If you want to use images instead of HTML text, you need to select the
Image radio button. Each navigation item is in its own table cell.
10. Select Vertical Menu or Horizontal Menu from the drop-down list.

11. Select the Font face, size, style, and alignment.
Of course, this isn’t necessary if you’re using graphics rather than
HTML text.
12. Using the appropriate Text and Cell color swatches, select the text
color and cell background color for the Up (normal) state.
If you don’t want to use the defaults, click the color boxes to open the
color picker. At the bottom of the dialog box, you can see a preview of
your menu, as shown in Figure 7-8.
13. Using the appropriate Text and Cell color boxes, select the text color
and cell background color for the Over (rollover) state.
If you don’t want to use the defaults, click the color boxes to open the
color picker. At the bottom of the dialog box, you can see a preview of

14. Click the Next button at the bottom of the Pop-up Menu Editor.
The Advanced tab becomes active.
15. Adjust any of the parameters in the Advanced tab as needed.
All these settings can be previewed at the bottom of the dialog box,
except Menu Delay:
• Cell Width and Cell Height: By default, Fireworks sets the cell width
and cell height automatically, based on the content, but you can
select Pixels from the drop-down list and type in a custom width
and/or height.

• Cell Padding and Cell Spacing: Cell padding is the space between
the edges of the cells and the text within the cells. The default Cell
Padding setting is 3. Cell spacing is the space between the edge of
one cell and the edge of an adjacent cell. The default Cell Spacing
setting is 0.
• Text Indent: Text indent is the number of pixels from the left (in a
vertical menu) or from the top (in a horizontal menu) to the text, not
including the gaps introduced by cell padding and cell spacing. The
default Text Indent setting is 0.
• Menu Delay: Menu delay is the amount of time your menu stays 
on-screen after the user’s mouse rolls off the menu. It is adjusted in
milliseconds (ms), or thousandths of a second. The default, 1000 ms,
is one second.
• Border: The border of your pop-up menu can be turned on or off
(and adjusted if on), and the colors that make up the border are 
customizable.
16. Click the Next button at the bottom of the Pop-up Menu Editor.
The Position tab becomes active.
17. Click a Menu Position icon.
The X and Y coordinates, which represent the top-left corner of the
menu relative to the slice, update. You can type your own values for
the X and Y coordinates if you want to customize them.
18. Click Done.
The Preview pane that you access at the top of your canvas does not allow
you to see the pop-up menu in action. In order to preview your pop-up menu
in action, you must choose File➪Preview in Browser or use the key command
F12. Any Web browser installed on your computer can be used to preview
your menu, as long as you have JavaScript enabled on that browser.
Pop-up menus are a tricky business, and their appearance can vary in 
different browsers. Be sure to test all your target browsers to make sure
they display the menus acceptably.
When you make a slice active that has a pop-up menu behavior attached,
an outline shows on the canvas in Fireworks where the pop-up menu will
appear when the user rolls over the slice.
To edit the pop-up menu, click the behavior handle (the round icon in the
middle of the slice, visible when the slice is selected) and choose Edit 
Pop-up Menu, or double-click the Behavior in the Behaviors panel.

its Roundtrip HTML capabilities, so Fireworks recognizes changes made in
Dreamweaver (and vice versa) in a wider variety of Web page formats
than ever.
The applications in the suite have complementary, and in some cases, even
overlapping, capabilities. We explore some of those capabilities in the next

you also have access to all the regular options available from the Export
dialog box. See Book III, Chapter 7 for information on advanced export
options.
Integrating Fireworks with Macromedia Flash
You can open, edit, and export animated GIFs in both Macromedia Flash and
Fireworks. If you’re creating an animated GIF only as an alternative to an
SWF (for users who come to your Web page who don’t have the Flash plug-
in), you’ll want to use Macromedia Flash to generate the GIF and SWF
(Shockwave Flash) animations. Macromedia Flash was built as a powerful
animation program, which means that it offers more flexibility, more sophis-
ticated animation tools, and more advanced export options for animations
than Fireworks.
Exporting files from Fireworks to Macromedia Flash
Sometimes all the sophistication and flexibility that Macromedia Flash pro-
vides is more than you want or need. You may find Fireworks a more con-
genial environment for creating or editing simple, silent, non-interactive
animations for the Web, whether as animated GIFs or SWFs.
Fireworks can export SWFs, but behaviors won’t be exported from
Fireworks with the SWF. Nor will masks, live effects, some text formatting,
and numerous other features of your PNG. If you want to work with ele-
ments of your PNG in Macromedia Flash, you don’t need to export it — you
can simply import it into Macromedia Flash. (See Book V, Chapter 10 for
details on the advantages of and restrictions on importing Fireworks PNGs.)

Integrating Fireworks with Macromedia Flash
332
Nevertheless, if you want to export a simple SWF animation from Fireworks,
it’s a snap. Just follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪Export, or use the key command Ctrl+Shift+R.
The Export dialog box appears.
2. Change the filename from the default, if necessary.
3. Select Macromedia Flash SWF from the Save as Type drop-
down list.
4. Click the Options button if you plan to import the file into
Macromedia Flash for editing; otherwise, click OK.
Clicking the Options button opens the Macromedia Flash SWF Options
dialog box, which gives you control over objects, text, JPEG quality,
frame rate, and which frames to export:
• Objects: Select the Maintain Paths radio button if you want vector
shapes to be editable, but you don’t mind if their appearance shifts a
little. Select the Maintain Appearance radio button if you want the
shapes to look identical, but you don’t need to edit them within
Macromedia Flash.
• Text: Select the Maintain Editability radio button if you want to be
able to change the text after the SWF has been imported into
Macromedia Flash. Select the Convert to Paths radio button if you
want the text to appear the same in Macromedia Flash and don’t
plan to edit it.
• JPEG Quality: Type a number between 1 and 100 or use the slider to
select a number to set the optimization for JPEGs (to activate the
slider, click the button with the downward-pointing arrow next to
the JPEG Quality text field). For more information on JPEG quality
settings, see Book III, Chapter 6.
• Frames: Select the All radio button if you want all the frames in your
PNG to be in the exported SWF. If you want only a select series of
frames to be exported, select the From radio button, and in the text
fields, type the number of the first and last frame in the PNG that
you want in the SWF.
• Frame Rate: Type the number of frames per second at which you
want your exported SWF to run.
Of course, you can also click the Quick Export button and choose
Macromedia Flash➪Export SWF, as shown in Figure 8-3.

You can’t import or open SWFs in Fireworks, but you can import or open
Fireworks PNGs in Macromedia Flash. Read on to find out how.
Importing files into Macromedia 
Flash from Fireworks
If you want to design a Macromedia Flash-based Web page, you can do so in
Fireworks, but you’ll need to import the PNG into Macromedia Flash and
create the interactivity in Macromedia Flash.
Macromedia Flash can import PNG files, either as flattened files (with or
without alpha transparencies, which are transparent or semi-transparent
areas) or as sets of editable Library items. Macromedia Flash can’t import
slice information, Live Effects, or JavaScript behaviors, but it can preserve
different button states on their respective separate frames. For more infor-
mation on what Macromedia Flash can and cannot import in a PNG, see
Book V, Chapter 10.
And of course, Macromedia Flash can import JPEGs and regular GIFs, so you
can export those formats from Fireworks for easy import into Macromedia
Flash.
Figure 8-3:

shortcut to

Macromedia Flash cannot dynamically load progressive JPEGs. See Book III,
Chapter 6 for information on progressive JPEGs.
Macromedia Flash can import SWFs that were created in and exported from
Fireworks, but keep in mind that many benefits of SWFs are not available in
SWFs exported from Fireworks. (See the section, “Exporting files from
Fireworks to Macromedia Flash.”) If you want interactivity in your SWF,
you’re better off designing objects in Fireworks (or FreeHand) and then
importing the Fireworks PNG (or FH11 file) into Macromedia Flash. Of
course, you also have the option to author the movie using only
Macromedia Flash.
Integrating Fireworks with Dreamweaver
Fireworks is a Web design tool, and Dreamweaver is an HTML editor (XML
editor, ColdFusion editor, and so on). The two programs have overlapping
capabilities, and they have complementary capabilities. Not only that, but
they’re designed to work together to make Web page creation and modifica-
tion a breeze.
Basically, if you generate your HTML in Fireworks and edit the code in
Dreamweaver, Fireworks recognizes the changes you make in the other
application. That goes for links, image maps, behaviors shared by both 
programs, and HTML text. Macromedia coined the term Roundtrip HTML to
describe the way the two programs work together.
Setting preferences
You need to establish a few settings, both in Dreamweaver and in Fireworks,
to work with Roundtrip HTML. In Dreamweaver, you need to define a local
site (see Book II, Chapter 3) and make Fireworks your primary image-editing
application (see Book II, Chapter 7).
In Fireworks, you should set a few preferences. Just follow these steps:
1. Choose Edit➪Preferences or use the key command Ctrl+U.
The Preferences dialog box appears.
2. Click the Launch and Edit tab to make it active.
You use the two drop-down lists for specifying the treatment of
Fireworks source files: When Editing from External Application and
When Optimizing from External Application.

Macromedia Products

3. Select one of the three options from the When Editing from External
Application drop-down list:
• Always Use Source PNG: This option means that when you launch
Fireworks from within another application, the original PNG source
file for the Web page or table will open in Fireworks.
• Never Use Source PNG: If you select this option, when you launch
Fireworks from within another application, the exported GIF or JPEG
you select will open in Fireworks.
JPEG is a lossy format, so if possible, you’ll want to edit the image
from the original source file. For more information about lossy 
compression, see Book III, Chapter 6.
• Ask When Launching: Choosing this option means that every time
you launch Fireworks from within another application, you will be
prompted to specify whether you want to edit the PNG source file
or the exported optimized image.
4. Select one of the three options from the When Optimizing from
External Application drop-down list.
The options are identical to those in the When Editing from External
Application drop-down list.
5. Click OK.
Editing PNGs
When you’re editing your Web page in Dreamweaver, you may find that it’s
not working quite the way you wanted it to. You may add text to one cell
and find that it creates a misalignment of an image in the adjacent cell in the
table that makes up your page. Perhaps you need to slice an image differently.
In cases like these, you’ll want to edit your PNG source file, instead of making
massive changes in Dreamweaver that can make your PNG source file out of
sync with the Web page it represents. Luckily, you can launch and edit your
Fireworks PNG source file from within Dreamweaver by following these
steps:
1. Click the optimized image in the Dreamweaver document window.
The Property inspector updates to display image parameters.
2. Click the Fireworks Edit button in the Property inspector, as shown in
Figure 8-4, or right-click the optimized image and choose Edit with
Fireworks from the contextual menu that appears.
If Dreamweaver cannot locate the PNG automatically, the Find Source
dialog box appears. Click Yes, because you want to locate the PNG

Integrating Fireworks with Dreamweaver

source file for the image you selected for editing. Navigate to the source
file in the Open dialog box and either double-click the PNG file’s icon or
click the file’s icon and click Open. The source PNG file opens in
Fireworks. At the top of the canvas, the words “Editing from
Dreamweaver” show that Roundtrip HTML is in effect.
3. Edit the image and/or slice as needed.
4. Adjust any Optimization settings if necessary.
See Book III, Chapter 6 for information about optimizing images.
The new version of the image will be exported at the new settings you
specify or at the previous settings if you opt not to change them.
5. Click the Done button at the top left of the canvas.
The Fireworks window closes, and the new image is visible in the
Document window in Dreamweaver.
If you don’t need to change anything about the image but its optimization
settings, you can select the images and click the new Optimize in Fireworks
Edit button in Dreamweaver’s Property inspector. A special Optimize Images
dialog box appears, where you can edit optimization settings. Just click the
Update button when you’ve made the adjustments.
Working with tables
When you export HTML from Fireworks, you export code that tells a browser
where each slice goes by establishing a table with cells arranged in rows
and columns to correspond with your slices. If you want to take advantage
of Roundtrip HTML for editing tables, make sure your Export settings
include Dreamweaver HTML as the HTML Style and that you’ve set the
option to include HTML comments (see Book III, Chapter 7 for details). If
you want to make major changes to the table structure after you start

editing the HTML in Dreamweaver, whether or not that requires reslicing
images, you should launch from Dreamweaver and edit the table in your
Fireworks PNG source file:
1. Select the table in Dreamweaver.
The Property inspector updates to display the parameters of the table.
2. Click the Fireworks Edit button in the Property inspector.
If need be, you can navigate to the source PNG file from within the
Dreamweaver Property inspector by clicking the File icon next to the
Edit button. The source file opens in Fireworks.
3. Make edits to the slices, guides, and images as necessary.
You can even edit the HTML in text slices if you wish.
4. Click the Done button (to the left of the Editing from Dreamweaver
icon at the top of the canvas) when you are finished editing.
The Fireworks window closes, and Dreamweaver updates the table
and images.
If you have made substantial changes to table structures in Dreamweaver,
though, Fireworks may not recognize the code. In that case, when you
launch and edit the table in Fireworks, Fireworks will overwrite the
changes you made in Dreamweaver. A prompt notifies you when
Fireworks will overwrite the existing Dreamweaver edits.
What if you accidentally delete the PNG source file, or you don’t have a copy
of it in the first place? The Fireworks Reconstitute Table feature can save the
day. Fireworks can make an existing HTML table with image slices into an
editable PNG — as long as no tables are nested in the table you want to
reconstitute — and can even import behaviors and pop-up menus created
in Fireworks or Dreamweaver. If you have multiple, non-nested tables on the
page (tables stacked one on top of the other, for example), Fireworks opens
a PNG for each table.
To create new PNGs from an HTML file with multiple, non-nested tables,
follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪Reconstitute Table.
The Open dialog box appears.
2. Navigate to the HTML file and double-click to open it or select the file
and then click Open.
Each non-nested table in the HTML opens in its own window, with slices
named and in place, and rollover behaviors attached.

To create a new PNG from the first table in an HTML file that has multiple
tables, follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪Open.
The Open dialog box appears.
2. Navigate to the HTML file and double-click to open it or select the file
and then click Open.
The first table in the file opens in Fireworks, with slices named and in
place, and rollover behaviors attached.
To add the first table in an HTML file with multiple tables to an existing PNG,
follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪Import.
The Open dialog box appears.
2. Navigate to the HTML file and double-click it or select the file and
click Open.
The insert pointer appears when you place the cursor over the canvas.
3. Place the pointer at the top-left corner of where you want the
imported table to go and click.
The table — slices, images, JavaScript, and all — appears. Objects are
spread in layers based on table structure.
You can also import XHTML, CFML, UTF-8 encoded files, and more. (See the
Using Fireworks PDF on your Macromedia Studio installation CD for details.)
After you export the reconstituted table from Fireworks, you can take
advantage of Roundtrip HTML from that point on.
Integrating Fireworks with FreeHand
FreeHand is a vector graphics application, so it shares many capabilities
with Fireworks. The main difference between the programs is that FreeHand
is best used to create images primarily for print design (because it has more
extensive drawing capabilities), and Fireworks is made to be used primarily
for Web page design.
Print and Web design jobs use different color modes:
✦CMYK: Offset printing, the four-color process used to create most 
mass-produced printed materials, utilizes the color mode CMYK
(Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and blacK).

Book III
Chapter 8
Integrating Fireworks
MX 2004 with Other
Macromedia Products
Integrating Fireworks with FreeHand
339
✦RGB: Though some Web graphics may be made using the Grayscale or
other modes, by and large, graphic production for the Web uses the
RGB (Red, Green, Blue) mode, because RGB is the mode used for com-
puter monitors.
Changing an image from one mode to another requires a conversion process.
If you have designed a page in Fireworks but you want to repurpose the
design for a print piece, you should import it into FreeHand to perform the
conversion from RGB to CMYK. Some colors may shift slightly, because the
two modes do not share all colors. For more information, see Book IV,
Chapter 6.
Despite the differences in color mode for print and Web design jobs, docu-
ment portability between FreeHand and Fireworks is pretty seamless. You
can open FreeHand files (.fh11) in Fireworks and Fireworks PNGs in
FreeHand. Some features of Fireworks PNGs may not be available or trans-
late to FreeHand, and some FreeHand options and settings may not be avail-
able when you open an FH11 document in Fireworks, including Live Effects
and slices. (See the Fireworks Help files for a complete list.)
Importing FreeHand files into Fireworks
To import a FreeHand MX file (or any FreeHand file from version 7 or later)
into Fireworks, follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪Import or use the key command Ctrl+R.
The Import dialog box appears.
2. Navigate to the FreeHand file and double-click it, or select it and then
click the Import button.
The Vector File Options dialog box, shown in Figure 8-5, appears.
3. Adjust any settings that you wish to change from the file-specific
defaults:
• Scale: Scale sets the scale of the imported file using a percentage. If
you change the scale, the width and height change automatically to
reflect the scaling percentage. Bitmap objects are not affected by
this setting.
• Width and Height: You can set the width and height of the imported
file by typing numbers in the text fields and selecting pixels, inches,
or centimeters from the drop-down lists.
• Resolution: Standard screen resolution is 72 dpi (pixels/inch). If the
file you’re importing is at another resolution, you may want to import
it at the standard screen resolution, because files at print resolution
tend to be bigger and slower, and the final resolution of your Web
images will be 72 dpi.

Integrating Fireworks with FreeHand
340
• Paths and Text: Select the check boxes for Paths and Text if you
want them to be anti-aliased (for smoothed edges) on import, and
select Crisp, Strong, or Smooth from the drop-down list to control
the anti-aliasing. You can change these settings later from the
Property inspector.
You can use the File Conversion settings to control how Fireworks
imports multi-page documents.
• Include Invisible Layers: By default, layers that are turned off in
FreeHand do not get imported to Fireworks. Select the Include
Invisible Layers check box if you want to import objects on layers
that are turned off.
• Include Background Layers: Select the Include Background Layers
check box if you want the objects on the background layer(s) of the
FreeHand file to be imported into Fireworks.
The Render as Images settings allow you to convert complicated
shapes and fills to bitmaps.
4. Click OK.
The Vector File Options dialog box closes and the pointer changes to
the right-angled Insert cursor when you place it over the canvas.
5. Put the cursor where you want the top-left corner of the imported file
to go and click.
The imported files objects are placed in the current frame of the
Fireworks document.

If you don’t want to import the whole FreeHand file, you have a couple
options. If you have enough room on your monitor to have Fireworks and
FreeHand open side-by-side, you can drag and drop shapes and bitmaps
from one application to the other.
Alternatively, you can copy and paste vectors and bitmaps from one appli-
cation to the other. To copy and paste a vector object from Fireworks to
FreeHand, just follow these steps:
1. Select a vector shape in Fireworks by clicking it on the canvas or in
the Layers panel.
2. Choose Edit➪Copy or use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+C.
If you want to copy only the outline of the shape, you can use the
Fireworks command Copy Path Outlines from the Edit menu or from
the Quick Export button.
3. Paste the shape into an open FreeHand document by choosing Edit➪
Paste from the FreeHand menu or using the key command Ctrl+V.
Your vector shape, including outline and fill information, appears in the
FreeHand document.
When you copy and paste or drag a vector shape with a FreeHand pattern
fill into Fireworks, if the pattern fill is not available in Fireworks, it will
be lost.
Editing Fireworks objects in FreeHand
You can copy bitmaps, text, and vector art from Fireworks into FreeHand
easily. Just follow these steps:
1. In Fireworks, select the bitmap, text, or vector object and copy it by
pressing Ctrl+C or by choosing Edit➪Copy.
2. Open FreeHand, if it’s not already open, and open a new document
by pressing Ctrl+N or selecting File➪New, if you don’t already have a
document open.
3. Select Edit➪Paste or use the key command Ctrl+V.
The Fireworks PNG Import Settings dialog box appears.
4. Select a file conversion method from the File Conversion drop-down
list, unless you want to import the Fireworks document as a single
flattened bitmap, in which case you may skip to Step 7.

Integrating Fireworks with Director
342
Your options for file conversion are
• Open frames as pages: Converts frames in the Fireworks document
into pages in the FreeHand document. If you select this option,
select the Remember Layers check box if you want the layers from
the Fireworks document to be preserved for each page in the
FreeHand document.
• Open frames as layers: Converts frames in the Fireworks document
into layers in the FreeHand document.
5. From the Frame drop-down list, select which individual frame from
the Fireworks document that you want to copy to FreeHand, or select
All to import all frames.
6. For objects and for text, select the radio button for one of the follow-
ing two options:
• Rasterize If Necessary to Maintain Appearance: When you select
this option, certain properties (gradients, drop-shadows, and the
like) lose their editability, but the object maintains its appearance.
• Keep All (Paths or Text) Editable: When you select this option, cer-
tain properties of the vector shape or text may shift in appearance,
but text or vector properties of the object remain editable within
FreeHand.
7. Select the Import as a Single Flattened Bitmap check box if you want
to import the object as you see it on your canvas in Fireworks.
If you’re pasting in text or a vector object, the object will no longer be
editable as text or a vector object, because it becomes a bitmap. If
you select this check box, the rest of the options in the Fireworks PNG
Import Settings dialog box become irrelevant, so they are grayed out.
8. Click OK.
The dialog box closes and the bitmap or vector object you copied from
Fireworks is added to the FreeHand document.
Integrating Fireworks with Director
The MX version of Director (Macromedia’s flagship multimedia authoring
application) wasn’t released at the time the original Macromedia Studio
suite came out, but has become available since. Fireworks and Director
can work together nicely if, for example, you want to edit a Director bitmap
cast member using the capabilities of Fireworks (in Director, objects like
bitmaps, shapes, and text are referred to as cast members). Macromedia’s
Web site gives you access to a Fireworks Import Xtra, which you need to
download and install if you are working with Director Shockwave Studio 
version 8.0 or earlier.

Book III
Chapter 8
Integrating Fireworks

Integrating Fireworks with Director
343
You can use Fireworks to create GIFs, JPEGs, 32-bit PNGs (with or without
transparencies), and HTML (with interactive and/or animated content), all
of which can be imported into Director.
The Quick Export button gives you easy access to two Director export modes:
✦Source as Layers: This mode exports each layer. You should use this
mode for layered PNG files or animations.
✦Source as Slices: This mode exports slices and behaviors in the form of
optimized images and HTML with JavaScript. You should use this mode
for rollover buttons or other interactive content.
Whichever option you select, the Export dialog box opens. The Trim Images
check box in the Export dialog box is selected by default when you export
to Director. The Trim Images option crops each layer or frame to remove
space outside the objects in each layer or frame. In other words, if your
canvas is 800 x 600 pixels, and you have an animation that uses only 25 per-
cent of the canvas, selecting the Trim Images check box will cause Fireworks
to crop the extra 75 percent out of each layer it exports.
You can also launch Fireworks from within Director to edit and optimize
cast members. To do so, you first want to set Fireworks as your external
image-editor by choosing File➪Preferences➪Editors from within Director
and selecting Fireworks for bitmap graphics.

In This Chapter
 Introducing FreeHand
 Appreciating vector graphics
 Navigating the interface
 Introducing the drawing tools
I
n this chapter, you get to know FreeHand MX up close and personal.
We show you what you can do with FreeHand and give you a tour of the
interface. In this chapter, we introduce you to the drawing tools that you use
to create vector objects. We also show you how to come to grips with those
pesky inspectors and panels that are lurking about the interface, just wait-
ing for you to try your hand at FreeHand.
Introducing FreeHand MX
First and foremost, FreeHand is an illustration program. You use it to create
illustrations for use in a variety of applications. FreeHand has sophisticated
drawing tools that you use to create shapes for your illustration. The shapes
range from ho-hum circles and rectangles to freeform shapes limited only
by your imagination. You can specify the color of the shape (known as a fill)
and whether the shape has an outline (known in FreeHand-speak as a stroke).
The shapes you create with the drawing tools are vector-based. What? You
say you don’t know what a vector is, Victor? Well, if you have to know right
now, you can fast-forward to the section, “Understanding the Role of Vector
Graphics.”
You combine the shapes you create with text objects, and if your design
requires, you can add a photograph to the illustration. Photo-realistic
images are also known as bitmaps, which you should not confuse with the
Windows-only BMP image format, which also goes by the name of bitmap.
When you have many objects in a document, it can be hard to select individ-
ual shapes. And sometimes you’ve got so many objects, it’s hard to see the
vectors for the bitmaps or text objects. The designers of FreeHand give
you an easy way to organize a busy document: layers. When you select

Using Illustration Tools for the Web
348
a layer, you can add objects to the layer and then arrange them just the way
you want. When you’ve got it just right, you can lock the layer and begin
working on another layer. No matter what you do on the new layer, you
can’t inadvertently mess up your locked layer — until you unlock it, that is.
Prior versions of FreeHand allowed you to create documents with vector
objects and bitmaps for print purposes. The current version of FreeHand
gives you increased support for creating objects for the Web. You can export
your document, or just selected objects from your document, in a wide vari-
ety of formats. And if it has been a long day and you’ve had all the FreeHand
you can handle, you can save the document in FreeHand’s native FH11
format for another day’s work. When you save a document in FreeHand’s
native format, you can edit all objects in the document and, if needed, add
more or delete existing objects.
Using Illustration Tools for the Web
When you have a program with as much power as FreeHand, you can easily
create documents for Web pages. The sophisticated drawing tools in
FreeHand make it possible for you to create the basis for Web page buttons
that you can add to a document you’re creating in Dreamweaver, or for that
matter, buttons for a Flash movie. You can assign links to the buttons. When
you’re finished with the document, you can export selected objects, or an
entire document, in Web-friendly image formats.
The illustration tools in FreeHand also make it possible for you to create
artsy-fartsy interfaces for your Flash movies and banners for your Web
pages. If you create a FreeHand document with multiple pages, you can also
export the whole thing as a Macromedia Flash SWF movie.
Understanding the Role of Vector Graphics
Vector objects are comprised of lines and curves that are redrawn mathemati-
cally, which results in a small file size. Vector-based graphics are resolution-
independent, which means that you can increase their size without losing
image fidelity. By contrast, bitmaps cannot be enlarged without losing fidelity.
Figure 1-1 shows an enlarged vector object alongside an enlarged bitmap.
(Which one would you rather use in that snazzy Web site you’re planning?)
When you create a vector object, you have point-by-point control over the
shape of the object. Vector objects have straight points and curve points.
You can specify which type of point is created when you create freeform
shapes with the Pencil tool. When you use the shape tools, the point type is
predetermined, but you can change them in a heartbeat. A curve point has
handles that you can click and drag to modify the shape. Figure 1-2 shows a
vector object with straight and curve points.

Investigating the FreeHand MX Interface
The FreeHand interface has many components. When you launch FreeHand
and create a new document, you get an interface with a document window,
a toolbar docked on the side of the interface, a status bar (Windows only) at
the bottom of the interface, and some panels and inspectors aligned along
the right side of the interface, as in other Macromedia Studio products like
Fireworks and Macromedia Flash. The FreeHand workspace is shown in
Figure 1-3.
When you launch the Windows version of FreeHand, you’ll see a blank gray
screen, and the interface is lightly shaded and inactive. To create a new
document and start working, just press Ctrl+N or choose File➪New from the
main menu.

Exploring the document window
In the center of the interface, you find what looks like a blank piece of paper.
(The Macromedia designers put a border and a drop shadow around it so
you can find it.) This is the document you are creating, and unless you’re
creating illustrations of polar bears in a blizzard, the document won’t stay
white and blank for long.
The area outside of the document is known as the pasteboard. No, you can’t
paste sticky notes on it to remind yourself to pick up milk on your way
home, but you can use it as a staging area for items you intend to use in the
document, but don’t quite know where yet. Objects outside of the document
area will not normally be printed or exported, but they are saved with the
FreeHand document.
Around the border of the document, you find a vertical and horizontal scroll
bar that you can use to pan to different parts of the document. Scroll bars
come in handy when you magnify the document or if the document has 
multiple pages. 
FreeHand has lots of contextual menus. Contextual menus contain com-
mands and options relevant to a selected item or workspace. You access the
commands in a contextual menu by right-clicking on the specific item or
workspace.

Using the drawing tools
On the left side of the interface, you find the toolbar, which shows various
tools neatly grouped and stacked. On the toolbar, you find your drawing
tools and other tools that you use to modify vector objects, move them,
reshape them, and more. We know you’re probably chomping at the bit to
find out what these tools do. Don’t worry. We show you how to use most of
the drawing tools in Book IV, Chapter 2. The other tools are discussed in
detail throughout Book IV as they pertain to different tasks you perform
with FreeHand.
In FreeHand, your tools are displayed on a floating toolbar by default. The
toolbar itself is neatly labeled Tools and your tools are divided into two
columns. Because it is a floating toolbar, you can click and drag it anywhere
in your workspace, dropping your tools at any convenient location. If you
don’t like the spot you’ve dropped the tools, you can click the title bar and
then drag and drop to reposition the toolbar. Figure 1-3 shows how the tools
look as a floating toolbar.
You can, however, lock the Tools toolbar to the top or bottom of the screen
if you’re more comfortable having the tools stay in the same location at all
times. Just click the toolbar’s title bar and drag the toolbar to the top or
bottom of the application window. A thick black outline previews where the
toolbar will go; release the mouse button when the outline sits where you
want the toolbar.
To select a tool, click its icon. If you’re not sure what a particular tool does,
hold your cursor over the tool for a second or two, and a ToolTip will appear.
ToolTips are enabled by default. If you prefer to work without ToolTips, you
can turn them off by choosing Edit➪Preferences. In the Preferences dialog
box, click the Panels tab and then deselect the Show ToolTips option.
Many of the tools have keyboard shortcuts, which is a convenient way to
quickly change from one tool to another. Some of the tools have two keyboard
shortcuts, a letter and a number. Table 1-1 shows the keyboard shortcuts for
frequently used tools listed in the order in which they appear on the toolbar.

Working with toolbars
In addition to the drawing tools, you have other tools to simplify your life
as a FreeHand illustrator. They’re tucked away as menu commands, but you
can get them anytime you need them by choosing Window➪Toolbars and
then selecting one of the following:
✦Main: Use this toolbar, which is open by default, to duplicate many
menu commands. On this toolbar, you find icons to open a document,
save a document, print a document, import graphics, open frequently
used panels, and more.
✦Text: Use this toolbar to format text objects in your documents. You can
choose font style, font size, font color, and specify paragraph alignment,
along with other options that are discussed in Book IV, Chapter 3.
✦Controller: Use the Controller toolbar to test a document you plan
to export as a Flash movie. You use the VCR-like controls to play the
movie and use the other icons to export the movie.
✦Info: Choose this toolbar to see information about objects you select.
The Info toolbar displays the type of object selected, the current
position of the cursor, as well as the object’s coordinates when you drag
it to a different position in the document.
✦Xtra Operations: Use this toolbar to transform and distort the path of
one or more selected objects in your document. We show you how to
use the available options from this toolbar in Book IV, Chapter 5.
✦Xtras: Use this toolbar to access FreeHand plug-in tools, such as the Arc
tool and Fisheye Lens tool. We show you how to use these tools in Book
IV, Chapter 5.
✦Envelope: Use this toolbar to transform shapes or object groups by
applying an envelope to them. When you distort or warp the envelope,
every shape or object within it is distorted or warped in the same way.
When you choose one of these toolbars, it appears as part of the main tool-
bar at the top of the interface. However, you can drag the toolbar into the
workspace if this suits your working preference. If you exit FreeHand and
leave several toolbars in the workspace, the program doesn’t clean up after

353
you; it assumes you’re perfectly capable of keeping your workspace tidy and
figures you want the toolbars in these positions. Every time you launch
FreeHand, the workspace is laid out as you last left it.
Perusing the panels
When you launch FreeHand, you find several panel groups aligned along the
right-hand side of the screen. Panel groups are combinations of panels that
you use to create or modify items for your FreeHand document. For example,
the Color Mixer tab of the Mixer and Tints panel gives you all the tools you
need to mix up a sky-blue-pink, or any other color your artistic muse or
client requires.
Each panel within a group has its own tab. If you don’t like a panel group’s
position, you can click on the bulleted list in the top right of the panel,
select Group Mixer With from the menu that appears, and then select the
panel you want to add the tab to. You can collapse panel groups when
you’re finished with them, or close them entirely to clear the workspace.
You can also create custom panel groups to suit your working preferences.
By default, the following panels are shown when you launch FreeHand:
✦Properties: The Properties panel includes two tabs: Object and
Document. The Object tab enables you to modify properties of the 
currently selected object on the screen, while the Document tab
enables you to modify the default properties of the entire document.
When you select an object, at the top of the Object tab you find a list
of properties of the object. The list may contain branches, that is, sets
of properties that are dependent on a property (branches are indented
under the property on which they’re dependent). When you select a
property from the list (simply click to select), editable options for the
property appear at the bottom of the panel. The properties that may
appear, depending on the type of object, are
• Object: If you click on the name of a vector object, the bottom of the
panel displays the height, width, and position on the page of the
object. For text objects, the basic text parameters — font, size, and
styling — are shown. You can change any of these parameters by
entering new values; a task we show you in Book IV, Chapter 4. If you
click the name of a bitmap, the position, dimensions, scale, and
other parameters appear at the bottom of the panel.
• Stroke: A stroke is a theoretical line that defines the perimeter of an
object; to make the stroke “real,” you give it attributes like width,
color, and texture. If you select a stroke in the list, the bottom of the
panel updates to show you the editable attributes of the stroke. If you
don’t like what you see, you can change the stroke by choosing differ-
ent options. We show you how to modify strokes in Book IV, Chapter 6.
• Fill: If you select the fill of a text or vector object, the bottom of the
panel displays editable properties of the current fill (color, as well as

Investigating the FreeHand MX Interface
354
pattern, gradient, or the like, as applicable). We show you how to
define an object’s fill in Book IV, Chapter 2.
• Effects: If you have an effect on the object (bevel, drop-shadow, and
so on), you can click it in the list to display various editable proper-
ties of the effect at the bottom of the panel.
✦Depending on the object or property selected in the list, the following
buttons may be active:
• Add Stroke: Click the Add Stroke button (the one with the pencil on
it) to add a stroke to the selected object.
• Add Fill: Click the Add Fill button (the one with the paint can on it)
to add a fill to the selected object.
• Add Effects: New to FreeHand MX, you can also add effects through
the Object tab. Select your object, and then select the Add Effects
button to add many cool effects, including blends, sketch, and trans-
formation effects.
• Remove Branch: Click the Remove Branch button (the one with the
trash can and three parallel lines) to remove a selected property and
any properties dependent on it.
• Remove Item: Click the Remove Item button to delete the selected
property or object from the list.
✦Mixer and Tints: The Mixer and Tints panel contains two tabs: the Color
Mixer tab and the Tints tab. You use the Color Mixer to mix a color.
You can mix the color using the CMYK (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Black)
color model, RGB (Red, Green, Blue) color model, HLS (Hue, Lightness,
Saturation) color model, or the System Color Picker. After you mix a
color, you can add it to the Swatches panel, a task we show you how to
perform in Book IV, Chapter 6. You use the Tints tab to specify the per-
centage or hue of the original color. We show you how to tint reds,
greens, blues, and other popular rainbow colors in Book IV, Chapter 6.
✦Layers: You use the Layers panel to add layers to a document and
manage layers within a document. We show you how to work with
layers in Book IV, Chapter 2.
✦Assets: The Assets panel includes three different tabs: Styles, Swatches,
and Library. You use the Styles tab to duplicate, edit, or delete styles being
used in your document. The Swatches tab is for creating a color palette for
objects in your document. The Library tab, as you might expect, includes
a set of ready-made objects that you can use in your document.
✦Answers: The Answers panel gives you quick access to all the help fea-
tures in FreeHand, including tutorials.
In addition to the default panels that are active when you launch FreeHand,
you can access several others by selecting Window➪Panel Name (substitute
Panel Name for the name of the appropriate panel). These panels include

355
✦Navigation: Use the Navigation panel to assign URL links to objects and
text in your FreeHand documents.
✦Halftones: Use the Halftones panel when you add screened objects to a
document. The only time you’d need to use halftones is when you’re
preparing a document for a postscript-printing device at a service
center. Halftones are beyond the scope of this book.
✦Align: Use the Align panel to align objects in your document. We show
you how to get your objects in alignment (without visiting a chiroprac-
tor) in Book IV, Chapter 4.
✦Transform: Use the Transform panel to move, rotate, scale, skew, or
reflect a selected object. We show you how to fold, spindle, and other-
wise mutilate objects with the Transform panel in Book IV, Chapter 5.
You can move a panel group to any desired position in the workspace by
clicking the panel title bar and then dragging and dropping it to the desired
position. Figure 1-4 shows two panels side by side. The panel on the left is
the shy, reclusive type as it is currently collapsed, while the panel on the
right is strutting its stuff in the expanded position.
Here are a few final tips on how to navigate and manage panels:
✦If you use a panel group frequently, collapse the panel group and move
it to a convenient position in the workspace.
✦When you have a panel group open with the Windows version of
FreeHand, you can switch between panels by pressing Ctrl+Tab.
✦To clear the workspace of all panel groups, choose View➪Panels (or
press F4).
✦To display hidden panels, choose View➪Panels (or press F4).
Modifying groups
Macromedia’s FreeHand design team worked long and hard to come up with
an optimum layout for panels and inspectors. They grouped panels and
inspectors in a logical manner. However, like everything else, the way panels
are grouped is not cast in stone, and if you’re one of those folks who like dif-
ferent strokes, you can change the way panels and inspectors are grouped
as follows:
Figure 1-4:
A tale of

1. Choose View➪Panels to bring up the default FreeHand panel grouping.
2. Select the name of the panel or inspector you want to group differently.
The panel or inspector appears. Alternatively, you can click the panel’s
or inspector’s tab to select it.
3. Make sure the tab you want to move is the active tab.
To make a tab active, simply click it. If the panel doesn’t have tabs, you
can skip this step.
4. Click the bulleted list near the upper-right corner of the panel.
5. Choose Group Name With, where Name is the name of the panel or
inspector.
6. Choose the name of the panel group you want to group the panel or
inspector with, as shown in Figure 1-5.
The panel or inspector is added to the group you specified and ban-
ished from its former home.
FreeHand has contextual menus, lots of them. Contextual menus contain
commands and options relevant to a selected item or workspace. You
access the commands in a contextual menu by right-clicking the selected
item or workspace.

W
hen you create an illustration with FreeHand MX, you start by
launching the program and creating a new document. After that,
you can begin creating your masterpiece. This process can involve getting
the word out by adding text, creating artwork by making standard shapes
with the shape tools or freeform shapes with the Pen tool, and setting
a dividing line between elements in your illustration with the Line tool.
When you create objects for your illustrations, you can outline the object
by defining a stroke and add color to the object by defining the object’s fill.
After you’ve created the document, you can save it for future editing and
refinement. When your document is complete, you export the document to
its intended destination.
In this chapter, you get an overview of the typical FreeHand workflow. We
also show you which tools you can use to create objects for your illustra-
tions and point you in the right direction for additional information and tips.
Creating FreeHand Documents
The default size for a FreeHand document is 612 x 792 points (81⁄2 x 11 inches),
which is letter size. You can modify the document size and add pages to the
document by using the Document tab of the Properties panel. You also use
the Document tab to set the bleed value — the amount of “spillover” of con-
tent that will be physically trimmed from the printed document — and final

output resolution of the document. You can also modify parameters, such as
the page orientation and the way thumbnails are displayed in the Document
tab. If you want, you can also create a Master Page to maintain the continuity
of all pages in the document. A Master Page has elements that will be used on
every page of the document, such as a text header with the client’s logo. We
show you how to create Master Pages in the “Creating a Master Page” section,
later in this chapter.
Creating a new document
You begin a FreeHand project by creating a new document. Creating a new
document gives you a blank page that you use to assemble the artwork for
your illustration. You can create a new document one of two ways:
✦Choose File➪New Document.
✦Click the New Document icon that looks like a blank letter in the Main
toolbar. To open the Main toolbar, choose Window➪Toolbars➪Main.
After you create a new document, it appears in the center of the Document
window, as shown in Figure 2-1.

Modifying documents with the Properties panel
You use the Document tab within the Properties panel to change the orien-
tation of the document, change the size of the document, and so on. If the
Properties panel is open but the Object tab is active, you can click on the
Document tab, shown in Figure 2-2, to make it active. If the Properties panel
is not open, choose Window➪Document. 
Changing the document size and orientation
If you need to change the size of a document, you use the Document tab of
the Properties panel. You can choose from a standard document size, or
create a custom size. You also use the Document tab to change the docu-
ment orientation from portrait (vertical) to landscape (horizontal). To
modify the document size and orientation, follow these steps:
1. If necessary, click the Document tab in the Properties panel to make
it active. 
If the Properties panel is not open, choose Window➪Document. The
Document tab of the Properties panel opens (refer to Figure 2-2). 
2. Select the Page Size drop-down list.
The Page Size drop-down list appears and provides you with a series of
page size options.
3. Choose one of the preset options.
The first five presets are European sizes. The available presets are as
follows:
• A3: Creates a document sized 841.89 x 1190.55 points.
• A4: Creates a document sized 595.27 x 841.29 points.

• A5: Creates a document sized 419.52 x 595.27 points.
• B4: Creates a document sized 708.66 x 1000.60 points.
• B5: Creates a document sized 498.89 x 708.66 points.
• Legal: Creates a document sized 612 x 1008 points.
• Letter: Creates a document sized 612 x 792 points.
• Tabloid: Creates a document sized 792 x 1224 points.
• Web: Creates a document sized 550 x 400 points, which incidentally
is the default size for a Flash movie. The default orientation for this
preset is Landscape.
• Custom: Choose this preset, and the x and y fields become available.
You can then enter values in these fields to create a document of the
desired size.
The measurements in the preceding list are shown in points, the default
FreeHand unit of measurement. You will see different values if you change
to a different unit of measurement. (To change to a different unit of meas-
urement, choose one from the Units drop-down list at the bottom of the
Document window.) For example, if you change the unit of measurement
to inches, Letter size is 8.5 x 11 inches.
4. Click the desired orientation button.
You can choose from Portrait to create a document that is taller than it
is wide, or Landscape to create a document that is wider than it is tall.
Adding pages to a document
If you use FreeHand to create storyboards or Flash movies, you can add as
many pages as you need to get the job done. When you add pages, you can
format them using a previously created Master Page. To add one or more
pages to your document, follow these steps:
1. If necessary, click the Document tab in the Properties panel to make
it active.
If the Properties panel is not open, choose Window➪Document. The
Properties panel appears with the Document tab selected.
2. Click the arrow near the upper-right corner of the panel.
The Options menu appears, as shown in Figure 2-3.
3. Choose Add Pages.
The Add Pages dialog box, shown in Figure 2-4, appears.
4. Enter a value for the number of pages you want to add.

5. If you have created a Master Page (see “Creating a Master Page,” later
in this chapter), select a Master Page from the Make Child of Master
Page drop-down list. If you don’t want to use a Master Page to format
the document, skip to Step 6.
When you choose an option from this drop-down list, the new page
inherits the characteristics of the selected Master Page. Note: This
option is unavailable if you’ve changed the page size.
6. Accept the default document page size, or select the Page Size radio
button and select a different page size from the drop-down list.
You can choose a default page size, or you can select Custom to enter
your own values for document size.
7. Click OK.
FreeHand adds the pages to your document. Alternatively, you can click
Cancel to void the operation.
You can also add a page by clicking the Add Page button (the page with a
plus sign in it) at the bottom of the Document window.
You can also duplicate a page, remove a page, or convert the current page
to a Master Page by choosing Window➪Document, clicking the arrow near
the upper-right corner of the Document tab, and then choosing the appro-
priate command from the Options menu.

Creating a Master Page
If you need to create a multipage document that you want to use as a Flash
movie or as a storyboard, you can use the Document tab in the Properties
panel to create a Master Page that you can apply to any or all pages in the
document. A Master Page is like a template; it has common items and attrib-
utes that are applied to all children of the Master Page. To create a master
document, follow these steps:
1. If necessary, click the Document tab in the Properties panel to make
it active.
If the Properties panel is not open, choose Window➪Document. The
Document tab in the Properties panel appears.
2. Click the arrow near the upper-right corner of the Document tab.
The Options menu appears (refer to Figure 2-3).
3. Choose New Master Page from the menu.
FreeHand creates a blank page entitled New Master Page-01. If you don’t
like the name, there’s not much you can do about it; the designers of
FreeHand make sure the name is cast in stone.
4. Create the elements that you want to appear on all pages that use this
Master Page.
For example, you can create a text header with your client’s logo.
You can create as many Master Pages as needed for a document by follow-
ing the preceding steps. New Master Pages will be appended by the next
available Master Page number.
To format an existing page using a Master Page, follow these steps:
1. If necessary, click the Document tab in the Properties panel to make
it active.
If the Properties panel is not open, choose Window➪Document. The
Document tab within the Properties panel opens.
2. Navigate to the page you want to format using a Master Page.
You navigate to the page by clicking its thumbnail in the Document tab,
or by using the Hand tool to scroll from one page to another in the
Document window. You can also choose the page number from the Go
To Page drop-down list at the bottom of the Document window.
3. Select the desired page from the Master Page drop-down list.
The page inherits the characteristics of the selected Master Page.

363
To covert a regular page to a Master page, select Convert to Master Page
from the Options menu in the top right of the Properties panel. 
Editing a Master Page
You’re on the home stretch of a project when all of a sudden your boss or
client rears his or her head and wants you to change the document. You
mumble some choice words under your breath until you remember you’ve
formatted most of the pages in the document using a Master Page. When
you edit a Master Page, all instances of pages to which the master is applied
are updated as well. To edit a Master Page, follow these steps:
1. Select a page that you formatted using a Master Page.
2. If necessary, click the Document tab in the Properties panel to make
it active.
If the Properties panel is not open, choose Window➪Document. The
Document tab of the Properties panel opens.
3. Click the Edit button.
FreeHand refreshes the Document window to display the Master Page.
4. Edit the Master Page as needed.
5. To apply your changes, select another document from the Window
menu on the Main toolbar, or click the Close (X) button for the
window.
All pages formatted with the Master Page are updated to reflect your
edits. If you closed the window with the Master Page, the most recently
edited page remains open.
Changing the Document Tab Thumbnail Display
When you create a document with multiple pages, you can display thumb-
nails of the pages in the Document tab of the Properties panel. When you
view pages in this manner, you can use the Page tool (a mahvelous device
we show you how to use in the next section, “Using the Page Tool”) to
rearrange the order of the pages. Follow these steps to modify the way
thumbnails are displayed in the Document tab:
1. If necessary, click the Document tab in the Properties panel to make
it active.
If the Properties panel is not open, choose Window➪Document. The
Document tab of the Properties panel opens.

Using the Page Tool
364
2. Click one of the buttons at the lower-left corner of the Document tab:
• The first button displays each page as tiny thumbnails.
• The second button displays each page as medium-size thumbnails.
• The third button displays a thumbnail of the selected page only.
The page thumbnails are displayed according to the button you
selected. FreeHand will remember your change the next time you open
the Document tab.
You can also use the Document tab of the Properties panel to set Bleed and
Resolution. When you print a document, FreeHand places registration marks
and crop marks according to the document size you specify. Registration
marks are the little cross hairs placed on the sides of a document that are
aligned to get perfect registration of all the colors in the printing process.
Crop marks are the long tick marks at the corners of the page that tell the
printer where to trim the printed sheet. The Bleed value is a margin for
error for the printer’s page-trimming process. When you enter a bleed
value, the registration marks are moved in from the edge of the page with-
out changing the document size. If you’re using a desktop printer and you
add a bleed value to the document, you may need to increase the page size
by that amount in your printer’s setup dialog box, otherwise you’ll get this
error message: “This document will not fit in the selected page size.” Refer
to your printer manual to determine the maximum resolution the printer is
capable of producing as well as how to modify the page size.
Using the Page Tool
When you create a multipage document, you use the Page tool to rearrange
the order of pages and select and delete pages. You find the Page tool —
it looks like a document with an arrow in it — with all the other FreeHand
tools, as you can see in Figure 2-5. To use the Page tool on a multipage 
document, do the following:
1. Deselect all objects, place your cursor inside the Document window,
and then right-click.
The contextual menu appears.
2. Choose View➪Fit All.
FreeHand refreshes the Document window to display all pages in the
document.
3. Select the Page tool from the Tools panel.

4. Click a page to select it.
After selecting a page, you can move it to a different position. This is
like rearranging the papers on your desk, but you can’t get messy and
overlap document pages. Figure 2-5 shows a multipage document being
rearranged with the Page tool.
You can also use the Document tab of the Properties panel to rearrange
pages. Open the Document tab and then switch to a view that shows thumb-
nails of all the pages in your document. Click a page thumbnail to select it
and drag it to a new location.
Opening Existing Documents
We know. We haven’t shown you how to save a document yet, and here’s
a section about opening them. Well, when you first begin working with
FreeHand, you may need to open existing FreeHand documents created by
someone else, and you usually open existing documents before you can edit
and save them, so here goes. To open an existing document, follow these
steps:
Page tool

Using the Document Grid
366
1. Choose File➪Open.
The Open dialog box appears.
2. Navigate to the folder where the file is located.
3. Select the file, and then click Open.
FreeHand displays the document and associated pages in the Document
window. You can now edit the document.
Using the Document Grid
When you create documents, you may need to enlist visual aids to help you
place objects with precision. Visual aids are a definite benefit if you’re deal-
ing with a small monitor, or if you’re working with a large monitor, but you
have managed to work your way into wearing trifocal glasses.
Your first line of optic defense is the document grid, which is a series of
equally spaced vertical and horizontal dotted lines. To view the document
grid, choose View➪Grid➪Show. You can use the grid intersections as anchor
points for items you add to a document. You can toggle the grid on and off
at will, as well as modify other grid parameters. Note that the grid only
shows up onscreen, not in the printed document.
After you enable the grid, you can give it a magnetic personality by choosing
View➪Grid➪Snap to Grid, which causes objects you create to snap to grid
intersections. If you’re creating an illustration for duck hunters, enabling the
Snap to Grid feature is an easy way to get your ducks in a row.
After you display the grid, you can modify the grid spacing to suit the docu-
ment you are creating:
1. Choose View➪Grid➪Edit.
The Edit Grid dialog box appears.
2. Enter a value in the Grid Size field.
This is the new grid spacing using the default document unit of measure.
3. Select the Relative Grid check box.
This option is disabled by default. Selecting this option causes objects
when moved to snap to the same relative position within different grid
spaces. Do not select this option if you want objects to snap to grid
intersections.

4. Click OK to apply the changes.
FreeHand resizes the grid to the value you specified.
Using Rulers
FreeHand has yet another visual aid you can use: rulers. To view rulers,
choose View➪Page Rulers➪Show.
You can modify the rulers’ unit of measure by choosing View➪Page Rulers➪
Edit.
Creating guides
After you display rulers, you can create guides to further aid in aligning
objects in your document. You can create as many vertical and horizontal
guides as you need, essentially making a custom grid, where the guide lines
don’t need to be equally spaced or fill the screen. You do not need to delete
guides when you print the documents, because the guides don’t get printed.
You can create guidelines by dragging them from the rulers, and if needed,
position them precisely using menu commands.
To create a guide, follow these steps:
1. Click one of the rulers and drag into the Document window.
Click the horizontal ruler to create a horizontal guide; click the vertical
ruler to create a vertical guide. As you drag, a blue line designates the
guide’s current position. You can use the opposite ruler to view the cur-
rent location of the guide.
2. Release the mouse button when the guide is in the desired position.
A FreeHand guide is added to your document. If the guide isn’t positioned
perfectly, you can click it and drag it to a new position. If you need to pre-
cisely position a guide, please refer to the next section, “Editing guides.”
If you have both the grid and guides showing, the workspace can become a
bit cluttered. We recommend that you only use one or the other.
You can customize the way that guides behave as follows:
✦Snap to guides: Objects snap to guides by default. To disable snapping
to guides, choose View➪Guides➪Snap to Guides. To enable snapping,
choose the command again.

Using Rulers
368
✦Hide and show guides: When you add guides to a document, they are
visible by default. You can hide guides by choosing View➪Guides➪Show
or clicking the check mark icon at the left of the Guides row in the Layers
panel. To view hidden guides, choose View➪Guides➪Show again or click
the empty space at the left of the Guides row in the Layers panel.
✦Lock and unlock guides: When the guides are positioned the way you
want them, you can lock them by choosing View➪Guides➪Lock. To unlock
all guides, choose the command again. You can also lock and unlock the
guides by clicking the Lock icon in the Guides row of the Layers panel.
Editing guides
If in spite of your best efforts, a guide is in the wrong place, you can precisely
position it where you want. To reposition an improperly placed guide, follow
these steps:
1. Choose View➪Guides➪Edit or double-click the guide that you want
to edit.
The Guides dialog box, shown in Figure 2-6, opens. If you have multiple
guides in your document, they are listed by type and position.
2. Select the guide you want to edit.
The guide is highlighted. If you double-clicked a guide to open the dialog
box, the guide is already selected. If you have a multipage document, you
also need to enter the number of the page whose guides you want to edit
or use the buttons at the top of the dialog box to navigate from one page
to another.
3. Click the Edit button.
The Guide Position dialog box opens, showing the coordinate of each
guide.

4. In the Location field, enter the position (coordinate) where you want
the guide to appear, and then click OK.
The Guide Position dialog box closes and the new location is recorded
in the Guides dialog box.
5. Click OK to reposition the guide.
The Guides dialog box closes and the guides get a move on.
When you choose View➪Guides➪Edit Guides, you can use the Guides dialog
box to add a guide, remove a guide, or release a guide (turn it into an object).
Adding Text to Your Illustration
When you use FreeHand to create an illustration, you can use the Text tool
to add text to vector and bitmap objects. You can do so much with text in
FreeHand that it truly boggles the mind. This section gets you up and run-
ning with the Text tool, but we show you the whole enchilada on text in
Book IV, Chapter 3. To add text to your document, follow these steps:
1. Select the Text tool — it looks like a capital letter A — from the Tools
panel.
2. Click the location where you want the text to appear in your document.
3. Type.
It’s really that simple.
4. When you’re finished typing, click anywhere outside of the text box.
The Text tool reverts to the Pointer tool, which you can now use to
move the text box to another location.
After you create text, you can change text characteristics to create wonder-
fully artistic text for your illustration. We show you how to do everything
with text — short of writing the next Great American Novel — in Book IV,
Chapter 3.
Creating Predefined Shapes
The easiest way to add vector shapes to your illustrations is by using the
shape tools. In this section, we show you the tools you can use to add shapes
to your illustrations, as well as how to add the shape to a document. Some
of the tools have parameters that you can define, such as the number of
sides in a polygon. We show you how to set these parameters and more in
Book IV, Chapter 4.

Creating Predefined Shapes
370
You can use the following tools (available from the Tools panel) to add
shapes to your illustrations:
✦Rectangle tool: You use this tool to add rectangles (and squares) to
your illustrations. The rectangles can have rounded corners or not.
✦Polygon tool: You use this tool to add star-like shapes to your illustra-
tions. In fact, you can specify whether you use the tool to draw a poly-
gon or a star. You can also specify the number of sides for the polygon.
To access the Polygon tool, click and hold the Rectangle tool, and then
select the Polygon tool from the pop-up menu.
✦Ellipse tool: You use this tool to draw ovals (or circles), or as high-brow
designers refer to them, ellipses.
To add a shape to your document, follow these steps:
1. Select a drawing tool from the Tools panel.
If you click the tool once, you draw a shape using the last settings speci-
fied for the tool. If the tool has definable parameters, you can choose
new parameters by double-clicking the tool. Tools that have modifiable
parameters have an inverted L to the upper right of their icons. Tools
with other tools hidden underneath them have a gray arrow to the
bottom right of their icons. The drawing tools are shown in Figure 2-7,
along with the boxes you use to color shapes and outlines.

Creating Custom Shapes with the Pen Tool
371
2. Click the place inside the document where you want the shape to
appear, and then drag diagonally to create the shape.
As you drag, FreeHand creates a preview of the shape. If you hold down
the Shift key while creating a shape, the shape width and height remain
equal. In other words, if you hold down the Shift key while using the
Rectangle tool, you create a square; hold down the Shift key while using
the Ellipse tool, and you create a circle.
3. Release the mouse button when the shape is the desired size.
FreeHand adds the shape to your document. After creating a shape, you
can move it to a different location with the Pointer tool, or you can
modify the shape by selecting it and setting available properties in the
Object tab of the Properties panel. We show you how to modify a shape
using the Object tab in Book IV, Chapter 4.
Creating Custom Shapes with the Pen Tool
You use the Pen tool to create freeform vector objects. The Pen tool gives
you point-to-point control over the shape you create. You can use the Pen
tool to create an open path or a closed path (the beginning and ending
points meet to create an outline). You can even use the Pen tool to trace an
image on another layer. (We show you how to add layers to a document in
the upcoming section, “Working with Layers.”)
To create a shape with the Pen tool, follow these steps:
1. Select the Pen tool from the Tools panel.
2. Click the place in the document where you want to add the first point.
When you click, you create a straight point; if you click and drag, you
create a curve point. You create a straight point when you want to
create a straight line segment, a curve point when you want a curved
line segment.
3. Click the spot where you want the second point to appear.
Remember to click and drag if you want a curve point. A curve point
has handles that you use to modify a curved line segment. You modify
handles with the Pointer tool or with the Subselection tool. The
Subselection tool — the white-headed arrow at the top-right of the
Tools palette — is covered in detail in Book IV, Chapter 4.
4. Continue adding points to define your shape.
You can double-click the Pen tool icon to select the Show Pen Preview
option, which will provide a preview of the path that will be created
when you make the next point.

Using the Line Tool
372
5. To complete an open path, double-click to define the last point; to
complete a closed path, click the first point.
Your shape is finished. Now you can use the Pen tool to create another
shape or to modify the shape that you just created.
If you are looking to create straight lines in combination with curved shapes,
then the Bezigon tool offers you greater control and flexibility than the Pen
tool. To use it, click and hold the Pen tool in the Tools panel. A pop-up menu
appears, and you can select the Bezigon tool to active it. The Bezigon tool
works similarly to the Pen tool, but with a major difference: When you hold
down the Alt key when creating points, the subsequent point will automati-
cally be constructed as a uniform curve! 
Using the Line Tool
You use the Line tool to create straight lines. You can modify the line style
and width in the Object tab of the Properties panel, a task we describe in
the upcoming section, “Creating Outlines.”
To use the Line tool, follow these steps:
1. Select the Line tool from the Tools panel.
2. Click the point where you want the line to begin and drag to create
the line.
As you drag the tool across the document, FreeHand creates a preview
of the line. If you hold down the Shift key while using the tool, you con-
strain the line to a predefined angle. (To predefine the angle, choose
File➪Document Settings➪Constrain and enter the value in the dialog
box.) As you drag, a filled square will appear at the pointer-end of the
line whenever it gets to a 45 or 90 degree angle.
3. Release the mouse button when the line is the desired length.
FreeHand creates a straight line using the old tried and true method of
following the shortest distance between the beginning and ending points.
Coloring Shapes
If you use a shape tool that creates a closed path or use the Pen tool to create
a closed path, you can add color to the resulting shape by defining a fill. You
can also add a fill to an open path. (Choose Preferences➪Object and select
the option to Show Fill for New Open Paths to add a fill automatically when
you draw an open shape. To add color to a shape, you use the Fill color box.)

Using the Fill color box
The Fill color box is near the bottom of the Tools panel, yet it’s one of the
most important tools in the whole lot. After all, a shape without color is kind
of drab. Of course, you can opt for the minimalist look and create a shape
with no fill and a stroke, in which case, you get an outline.
To define a fill for an object, follow these steps:
1. Click the Fill color box (the box to the right of the paint bucket) in the
Colors section of the Tools panel.
The color picker appears.
2. Move your cursor over the color cubes.
Your cursor becomes an eyedropper. As you move your cursor over the
color cubes, the window in the upper-left corner of the palette refreshes
and displays the color your cursor is currently over. A Tooltip displays
the color’s hexadecimal value and RGB value, as shown in Figure 2-8.
If you’re working for print instead of the Web, you may wish to use
Swatches instead of the default color cubes. Click on the triangle at the
top right of the color picker and select Swatches from the pop-up window
to use swatches. See your documentation for details on using Swatches.

3. Click a color to select it or click the No Color button (the box with the
diagonal red slash through it next to the color wheel at the top of the
window) if you want a shape with just an outline (stroke).
The swatch in the Fill color box refreshes to show the color you selected.
This color is used to fill any new shapes you create until you select a dif-
ferent fill color. If you select no color, a diagonal red slash (/) appears in
the Fill color box.
Changing a shape’s fill color
If a shape’s fill color doesn’t suit your (or your client’s) fancy, you can easily
change it. You can also create a custom fill using the Fill button in the Object
tab of the Properties panel, a colorful operation we show you how to do in
Book IV, Chapter 4.
Follow these steps to change a shape’s fill color:
1. Select the shape.
2. Click the Fill color box. (Refer to Figure 2-8.)
The color picker appears and your cursor becomes an eyedropper as
you move it over the palette.
3. Click a color to select it.
You can click in the color picker. The swatch in the Fill color box
changes to the color you selected, as does the color of the shape you
selected. Remember: You can revert from a filled shape to an unfilled
shape by clicking the No Color button. If you select No Color, the
diagonal red slash appears in the Fill color box.
Creating Outlines
You can create an object with no fill, select a stroke color, and you’ve got an
outline. If you create an object with no fill and no stroke, well . . . you’ve got
nothing. But seriously, you use the Stroke color box to select an outline
color for an object. If you need to change the stroke width, or style, you can
access the stroke’s properties using the Object tab in the Properties panel,
which is covered in detail in Book IV, Chapter 4.
Using the Stroke color box
You use the Stroke color box to choose a color for the outlines of the shapes
you add to your illustration. You can select any color from the color picker
or the System Color Picker (covered in Book IV, Chapter 6), or you can
choose to go sans stroke.

Follow these steps to select a stroke color:
1. Click the Stroke color box next to the icon that looks like a pencil.
The color picker appears.
2. Move your cursor over the palette.
Your cursor becomes an eyedropper. As you move your cursor over the
color swatches, a Tooltip displays the color’s hexadecimal and RGB
values. The window in the upper-left corner of the color picker refreshes
to show the color your cursor is currently over.
3. Click a color to select it.
If the shape you are creating won’t have a stroke, click the No Color
button. After you select a color, the palette closes, and the selected
color is displayed in the Stroke color box. If you click the No Color
button, a diagonal red slash appears in the Stroke color box. The color
you choose is applied to all shapes you create until you follow the pre-
ceding steps to select another stroke color.
Changing an object’s stroke color
If you create an object and the object’s outline (stroke) is not to your liking,
you can change it at any time. You can also add a stroke to a shape that
doesn’t have one.
To change the stroke color of an object:
1. Select the object by clicking on it with your mouse. 
2. Click the Stroke color box.
The color picker appears.
3. Move your cursor over the palette.
Your cursor becomes an eyedropper. As you move your cursor over the
color swatches, a Tooltip displays the color’s hexadecimal and RGB
values. The window in the upper-left corner of the color picker
refreshes to show the color your cursor is currently over.
4. Click a color to select it.
To remove a stroke from an object, click the No Color button. You can
also choose a color from the System Color Picker by clicking the System
Color Picker button to the right of the No Color button. After you select
a color, the color picker closes and the color is applied to the object’s
outline.

Working with Layers
376
Working with Layers
Layers are like thin sheets of clear plastic on top of your illustration. You
can see what’s underneath the plastic. In FreeHand, you use layers to organ-
ize your objects. You can also use layers to trace an object on a lower layer,
such as a complex bitmap image. Layers simplify your life as a FreeHand
illustrator, especially when you create a document with a lot of stuff.
When you create a new document, FreeHand gives you three layers to work
with: Foreground, Background, and Guides. Only objects on the Foreground
layer, or layers above the separation line, are printable. The separation line
is a horizontal black line in the Layers panel.
You use the Layers panel to create and otherwise manage layers. To open
the Layers panel, choose Window➪Layers. The Layers panel is shown in
Figure 2-9.
Creating layers
You can create a new layer whenever you need it. When you create a new
layer, it becomes the drawing layer until you select another layer to work
with. You create a new layer by following these steps:
1. Choose Windows➪Layers.
The Layers panel becomes activated.
2. Click the Options button (the bulleted list icon in the upper-right
corner of the panel).
The Options menu appears.
3. Choose New.
FreeHand creates a new layer with the default name of Layer followed
by the next available layer number, such as Layer-1. You’ll know it’s the
active layer because there will be a little pen next to the name of the layer. 
Figure 2-9:
Use the
Layers
panel to

4. Enter a new name for the layer by clicking and dragging to highlight
the default name, typing a new name, and pressing Enter.
This step is optional. You can rename the layer at any time. We strongly
advise you to get in the habit of giving your layers descriptive names,
especially if you’re creating documents with multiple layers.
You can duplicate the currently selected layer and all objects on it by open-
ing the Layers panel, clicking the Options button (the bulleted list icon in
the upper-right corner of the panel), and then choosing Duplicate from the
Options menu.
After you select a layer, it becomes the active layer. You can use the Layers
panel to perform any of the following tasks:
✦Hide and unhide objects: Click the check mark in the left column to
hide all objects on the selected layer. Click the column again to unhide
the layer.
✦Display objects as keylines: To display objects on a selected layer as
keylines (they look like outlines with an X through them), click the filled
dot in the center column of the Layers panel. The filled dot becomes
hollow and a keyline of each shape is displayed.
✦Lock and unlock layers: Click the open padlock icon in the third
column to lock the layer. After you lock a layer, the icon changes to a
closed padlock and you cannot edit or select objects on the layer. Click
the padlock again to unlock the layer.
✦Hide and display layers: Click the Options button (the bulleted list icon
in the upper-right corner of the Layers panel) and choose All Off from
the Options menu to hide all layers or choose All On to display all
hidden layers.
Editing layers
When you use layers to organize a complex illustration, objects on top
layers eclipse underlying objects on lower layers. You use the Layers panel
to rearrange the order of layers and to perform other tasks, such as merging
layers. You can also merge objects into a single layer when you’ve got every-
thing just the way you want it.
To edit layers, choose Window➪Layers to activate the Layers panel (if it’s not
already open and expanded), and then perform any of the following tasks:
✦Move layers: Select a layer in the Layers panel and drag it up or down
to a different position to change the way objects are displayed.

Saving Documents in FreeHand
378
✦Make layers non-printable: Select a layer in the Layers panel and drag
it below the separation line to make the layer non-printable.
✦Move objects between layers: You can move an object to a different
layer by selecting it in the Document window, and then in the Layers
panel, click the name of the layer to which you want to move the object.
✦Merge layers: To merge several layers into a single layer, select the
layers in the Layers panel, click the Options button (the bulleted list
icon in the upper-right corner of the Layers panel), and choose Merge
Selected Layers from the Options menu. Hold down the Shift key to
select multiple contiguous layers; hold down the Ctrl key to select non-
contiguous layers.
✦Merge foreground layers: To merge all foreground layers into a single
layer, click the Options button (the bulleted list icon in the upper-right
corner of the Layers panel), and then choose Merge Foreground Layers
from the Options menu.
✦Remove layers: You can remove a selected layer by clicking the Options
button (the bulleted list icon in the upper-right corner of the Layers
panel) and choosing Remove from the Options menu. If the layer you
are removing contains objects, FreeHand displays a warning dialog box
to that effect. Click Yes to delete the layer and all objects on it.
Saving Documents in FreeHand
When you finish creating a document, or you’ve had all the fun with
FreeHand that you can handle for the day, or at any point while you’re work-
ing, you can save your document. You can save the document as a FreeHand
file, a FreeHand template, or an Editable EPS file. Save the document as a
FreeHand file and you can edit the elements in the document when you
reopen it. When you open a document saved as a template, you can use the
elements in it as the basis for a new document. Saving a document as a tem-
plate is useful if you do repetitive work for a client that uses the same ele-
ments in all the documents, such as the client’s logo and address. You add
additional elements to the template as needed and use the Save As com-
mand to save the revised template as a document. When you save the file as
an Editable EPS file, you can work with the file in another illustration pro-
gram that supports the EPS format, such as Adobe Illustrator or CorelDraw.
When you save a document in any of these formats, you can later reopen
and edit the document. Note: You are limited to saving a single page docu-
ment when you choose the Editable EPS format.
In addition to saving documents, you can also export FreeHand documents
into a number of different graphics formats, including JPEG, GIF, PNG, TIF,
and BMP.

Saving FreeHand files
You can save a FreeHand document whenever you need to. When you save
a document that has been edited since it was last saved, an asterisk (*)
appears after the document’s name in the document title bar. To save a
document, follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪Save or press Ctrl+S.
The Save Document dialog box opens.
2. Enter a name for the document and navigate to the folder where you
want to save the file.
3. Choose the file format you want the document saved as.
You can choose from the following: FreeHand Document (.fh11),
FreeHand Template (.ft11), or Editable EPS (.eps).
4. Click the Save button.
FreeHand saves the document to the specified folder.
When you save a previously saved file, the Save Document dialog box does
not appear, and the file is saved using the same filename in the same location
as the previous iteration of the file.
You can save your work using a different filename. This option is handy
when you’re making lots of edits and saving a file frequently. You can save a
master version of the file, and then save a working version of the file using a
different filename. If you run into a computer glitch and the working version
of the file becomes corrupt, you can always revert to the master copy (or
another previous version) of the file. You also use the Save As command to
save a FreeHand template that you have added elements to in order to
create a new document. To save a file using a different filename:
1. Choose File➪Save As or press Ctrl+Shift+S.
The Save Document dialog box opens.
2. Enter a name for the document and navigate to the folder where you
want to save the file.
3. Choose the file format you want the document saved as.
You can choose to save the document in one of the following formats:
FreeHand Document (.fh11), FreeHand Template (.ft11), or Editable
EPS (.eps).
4. Click the Save button.
FreeHand saves the renamed document to the specified folder.

Computers can be cranky creatures and are subject to system overloads,
which may cause your machine to crash when you least expect it. In order
to avoid losing hours of work, save your work early and save your work
often.
Exporting files in other formats
You can create FreeHand illustrations for a wide variety of uses. You can
create images for the Web, illustrations for print, and Flash movies, to
name a few. When you need to use the finished illustration for a specific
application, you export the file in the necessary format. You can also save
the original as a previous-version FreeHand document. To export a file,
follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪Export.
The Export dialog box appears.
2. Enter a name for the file and specify the folder to which you want the
file saved.
3. Choose the export file format. You can choose to export the file as
one of the following:
• A bitmap file using the BMP, GIF, JPEG, PNG, or TIFF file formats.
• A vector file using the EPS or EMF file format.
• A Flash movie using the SWF format. You can import the end result
into Macromedia Flash, or embed the movie in an HTML document
for viewing on the Internet.
• A FreeHand 8, 9, or 10 file. 
• An Adobe Illustrator file, versions 1.1, 3.0/4.0, 5.x, 7.x, or 8.8.
• A PICT file (Macintosh only).
• A DXF file for use in 3D applications.
• A PDF file for viewing with the Adobe Acrobat Reader. The file may
also be printed from the Acrobat Reader.
• An RTF file for use in a word processing application.
4. Click the Save button.
FreeHand exports the file in the format you specify.

f you need to add text to an illustration, you use the Text tool. If you want
the text to jump up and get someone’s attention, FreeHand MX gives you
the tools to create really cool looking text. You can convert text to vector
objects, align text to paths, and much more. In fact, you can do so many
cool things with text in FreeHand, it would take forty or fifty pages to show
you all of them. Unfortunately, we don’t have that much space, but this
chapter shows you the important features of working with text in FreeHand,
so you’ll have plenty to work with.
In this chapter, we show you how to stylize your text by modifying fonts,
point size, and more. We explain how to use the Object tab of the Properties
panel to modify your text, as well as how to format your text. And if you
want to make your text jump through hoops, we show you how to do that
by aligning text to a path.
Creating Text Using the Text Tool
When you need to add text to an illustration, the first step is to call on the
Text tool. After you select the Text tool, you can create an auto-expanding
text box that grows wider as you enter more text, or you can create a text
box that is sized to fit a specific area of the illustration, in which case
FreeHand automatically wraps text to a new line as needed. You can
specify the font size, color, and other text attributes before or after you
enter text.

Creating Text Using the Text Tool
382
Creating auto-expanding text boxes
When you select the Text tool and create text in the document, the default
text block (box) is auto-expanding, which means the box gets wider as you
enter more text. To create an auto-expanding box of text, follow these steps:
1. Select the Text tool from the Tools panel.
The Text tool is the handsome-looking tool that’s identified by a capital A.
As you move the tool into the Document window, your cursor becomes
an I-beam.
2. Click the spot in your illustration where you want the text block to
begin.
A flashing vertical line signifies that FreeHand is ready for you to enter
text.
3. Begin typing.
Your text appears in the document.
4. Press Enter to create a new line.
Any text you type now appears on a new line. If you want a text box that
automatically wraps text from line to line, you need to create a fixed-
size text box, which we show you how to create in the next section.
5. Click anywhere outside of the text box when you are finished entering
text.
The Pointer tool is selected.
Creating fixed-size text boxes
When you create a fixed-size text box, you constrain the text to the size of the
box. When text reaches the side of the box, FreeHand automatically wraps
new text to the next line. To create a fixed-size text box, follow these steps:
1. Select the Text tool from the Tools panel.
2. Click the point in the illustration where you want the text to appear,
and then drag diagonally to define the size of the text box.
As you drag, FreeHand displays a dashed rectangle that gives you a pre-
view of the box’s current size.
3. Release the mouse button when the text box is the desired size.
FreeHand creates a rectangular bounding box.

4. Begin typing.
When you enter enough text to reach the side of the text box, FreeHand
wraps the text to the next line.
5. Click anywhere outside of the text box when you finish entering 
text.
FreeHand reverts to the Pointer tool that you can now use to resize or
move the text box. Figure 3-1 shows an auto-expanding text box and a
fixed-size text box.
You can add additional text to a text box by selecting the Text tool or
Pointer tool and clicking the text box at the point where you want to add
text. If you double-click a text box with the Pointer tool, it reverts to the
Text tool. If you’re using the Text tool, you need only click once. 
You can remove any empty text blocks from your document by choosing
Xtras➪Delete➪Empty Text Blocks.
Using Text Rulers
When you create text, FreeHand displays a text ruler above the text. The
text ruler is similar to the ruler you find at the top of the workspace of popu-
lar word processing programs. You use the text ruler in a similar manner.
You can change the indent of paragraph text and change the position of tabs
by dragging the icons at the top of the text ruler. After you finish entering
text and select another tool, the text ruler is no longer visible. To view the
text ruler, double-click the text box with the Pointer tool. Figure 3-2 shows a
block of text with its attached text ruler.
Text rulers are enabled by default. Choose View➪Text Rulers to hide text
rulers from view. Choose the command again to show text rulers.

Checking the Spelling of a Text Selection
If you’re like many designers, when you enter text, your fingers are flying
across the keyboard, especially when you have copious amounts of text to
stuff into a document. Sometimes your fingers are moving so fast that you
transpose letters and end up with some spelling errors. To safeguard against
exporting a document with spelling errors, you can spell check your text
selections:
1. Choose Text➪Spelling.
The Spelling dialog box appears.
2. Click the Start button.
FreeHand begins checking your document for spelling errors. If it finds a
spelling error, the suspect word is highlighted in the field at the top of
the dialog box. Possible substitutes are listed in a field underneath the
suspect word, as shown in Figure 3-3.
3. If the spell checker finds a word not listed in its dictionary, you can
choose one of the following options by clicking the appropriate button:
• Ignore: If you choose this option, the spell checker ignores the word
and checks the rest of the document for errors.

• Change: Choose this option after you select a word from the sugges-
tions list so that the spell checker can replace the suspect word with
the correctly spelled one that you selected.
• Ignore All: If you choose this option, the spell checker ignores this and
all future instances of the suspect word. This option is handy when
your document has several instances of a person’s name or something
else that would not be found in the dictionary but is spelled correctly.
• Change All: Choose this option when you select a word from the
suggestions list so that the spell checker can replace this and all
future occurrences of the suspect word.
• Add: If you choose this option, the spell checker adds the suspect
word to its dictionary.
After you click a button, the spell checker continues searching the rest
of the document for misspelled words.
You can select some basic preferences for the spell checker. You can access
these options by clicking the Setup button from the main Spelling dialog box.
Those options include:
✦Find Duplicate Words: When selected, this feature ensures that the
spell checker will show you when the same word appears sequentially
(such as “the the” appearing in a sentence). By default, this option is
selected.
✦Find Capitalization Errors: If selected, this option causes the spell
checker to look for anomalies in capitalization, including capital letters
in the wrong place and two sequential capital letters. By default this
option is selected. 
✦Ignore Words with Numbers: As you might expect, when selected, this
option ensures that the spell checker ignores words that include num-
bers in them. By default, this option is selected.
✦Ignore Internet and File Addresses: If selected, this option ensures that
the spell checker ignores Web addresses, such as www.dummies.com,
and file addresses, such as C:\Program Files. By default, this option
is selected.
✦Ignore Words in UPPERCASE: This option ignores words or acronyms
that are all in uppercase letters. By default, this option is selected.
✦Add Words to Dictionary: This is the only option that is not a check
box. The two options available for this tool are selectable as radio but-
tons. The first option, Exactly as Typed, adds words to the dictionary
just as they are typed. The All Lowercase radio button adds words to
the dictionary in lowercase, no matter how they look when they are
added. By default, the Exactly as Typed option is selected. 

Editing Blocks of Text
386
You can find and replace text and other objects in your FreeHand documents
by choosing Edit➪Find and Replace➪Text. Follow the prompts in the dialog
box to quickly locate text in your document.
Editing Blocks of Text
After you create a block of text, you can use the Pointer tool to move it or to
resize a fixed-size text box. You can also convert an auto-expanding text box
to a fixed-size box, and vice-versa.
Moving and deleting text
After you create a block of text, you can move or delete it as needed by fol-
lowing these steps:
1. Select the Pointer tool from the Tools panel, and then click the text
block to select it.
A bounding box appears around the perimeter of the text box.
2. To move the selected text box, click it and drag it to a new location.
The cursor changes to a four-headed arrow when you place it over the
bounding box to click and drag. The text box is moved.
3. To delete the text box, press the Delete or Backspace key.
The text box is gone. Alternatively, you can delete a selected text box by
choosing Edit➪Clear.
Resizing text boxes
If you create fixed-size text boxes, you can modify the width and height as
needed. To resize a fixed-size text box, select the text box with the Pointer
tool and do one of the following:
✦Resize a text box: To resize the text box, click and drag the corner
handle. The text reflows to the new dimensions of the text box.
✦Proportionately resize a text box: To proportionately resize the text
box, click the handle on any corner, and then while holding down the
Shift key, drag away from the center of the text box to make it larger, or
towards the center to make it smaller. Text inside the box reflows to the
new dimensions.
When you resize a text box using one of these methods, the text size
remains unchanged. You can resize the text as you resize the text box by
doing the following:

Book IV
Chapter 3
Using the
FreeHand MX
Text Tools
Editing Blocks of Text
387
1. Select the Pointer tool from the Tools panel, and then click the text
block to select it.
FreeHand draws a bounding box around the text box.
2. Click the handle at any corner of the text box, and while holding
down the Shift and Alt keys, drag the handle until the text box is
the desired size.
The text box is proportionately resized and the text is resized as well.
If you drag the middle handle on either side, or the center top or bottom
handle, you don’t resize the text, you change the text spacing. If you move
either of these handles towards the center of the text box, individual charac-
ters overlap, leaving you with a jumbled, illegible mess. If you drag the top
center or bottom center handle, you adjust the leading (line spacing) of the
text. Moving the handles toward the center of the box can create overlap-
ping lines, but dragging outward from the center can give your text a light,
airy feel by increasing the distance between lines.
Changing text box characteristics
You can change the characteristics of a text box at any time. For example, if
you have a fixed-size text box, you can convert it to an auto-expanding text
box, and vice versa.
To convert an auto-expanding text box to a fixed-size text box, follow these
steps:
1. Select the Pointer tool from the Tools panel, and then click the text
box to select it.
2. Double-click one of the middle handles on the sides of the text box
and one of the middle handles on the top or bottom of the text box.
You can now resize the text box by clicking any corner handle and drag-
ging. Remember: You can proportionately resize the text box by holding
down the Shift key while dragging.
Any text that is added that doesn’t fit within a fixed-size text block will not
be visible, and the Text Overflow icon appears at the bottom-right corner of
the text block. Stretch the text block from a corner point to see the added
text.
To convert a fixed-size text box to an auto-expanding text box, follow these
steps:
1. Select the text box with the Pointer tool.

388
2. Double-click one of the middle handles on the sides of the text box and
one of the middle handles on the top or bottom of the text box.
FreeHand shrink-wraps the box around the text inside. When you add
additional text to the box, it will expand to accommodate the additional
text. Remember: You can create a new line by pressing Enter.
Formatting Text
When you create text for a FreeHand document, you can format the text
before you type it in, or you can select all the text in the text box after the
fact and do your formatting then. You can specify the font style, font size,
font color, paragraph alignment, and much more.
You have three tools at your disposal for choosing text attributes: menu
commands, the Object tab of the Properties panel, and the Text toolbar. We
give you a brief overview of the menu commands and the Text toolbar, but
we focus on the Properties panel, FreeHand’s formatting powerhouse:
✦Menu commands: You can use the menu to specify font type, font size,
style, paragraph alignment, leading, baseline shift, and case (capitaliza-
tion). To format selected text using a menu command, choose Text,
choose a category from the menu, and then choose the desired com-
mand from the submenu. For example, choose Text➪Size➪12 to change
the font size to 12.
✦The Text toolbar: You use the Text toolbar to select a font, specify the
font size and paragraph alignment, and so on. You can even use the Text
toolbar to attach text to a path, as described in the upcoming section,
“Working with Text and Paths.” The Text toolbar is shown in Figure 3-4,
and like other FreeHand toolbars, you can leave it floating in the work-
space or dock it below the menu bar. To use the Text toolbar, choose
Window➪Toolbars➪Text.

✦The Object tab in the Properties panel: You can choose your font type,
style, size, and alignment using the Object tab in the Properties panel.
You can choose these parameters before or after creating a text box. To
open the Properties panel, choose Window➪Object. Make sure that
your text box is selected, and you’ll see a text block appear in the
Object tab, as shown in Figure 3-5. Choose from one of the five buttons
to specify parameters when working with text:
• Character: You use this section of the Object tab to choose a font
type, font size, style, paragraph alignment, leading, kerning, and
baseline shift. You can also apply effects to text in this section, as
well as choose a text style. The character button is the top one (with
“abc” on it).
• Paragraph: You use this section of the Object tab to specify para-
graph spacing and indentation, and answer the age-old question: “To

Choosing a font type, size, and style
You can choose a font style and size before you begin typing or after you
create a block of text. If you choose the font style after creating your text,
you have the added benefit of seeing a preview of the font, as it will be
applied to your text. To choose a font style, follow these steps:
1. Create a block of text.
You know the drill. Select the Text tool, click inside the document, and
type.
2. Click anywhere outside of the text box to deselect the Text tool.
The block of text is still selected, and the Pointer tool is now the active
tool.
3. Click the Character button in the Object tab of the Properties panel.
The character properties are displayed. If the Properties panel is not
open to the Object tab, choose Window➪Object or press Ctrl+F3.
4. Click the triangle to the right of the Font Name field and scroll
through the drop-down list.
The fonts you have installed on your system show up in the Font Name
drop-down list. As you scroll through the list, the first few words of the
selected text are displayed with the font style applied, as shown in
Figure 3-6.

5. Click a font name to select it.
6. Select a size from the Text Size drop-down list.
You can also enter your own value in this field if you want the text to be
sized differently than the preset values. If you type a value into this
field, you must press Enter to apply the size.
7. Select one of the following options from the Style drop-down list:
• Plain: Choose this default style if you like plain text.
• Bold: Choose this style to boldface the text.
• Italic: Choose this style to italicize the text.
• BoldItalic: Choose this style to boldface and italicize the text.
8. Close the panel to apply the characteristics to the text.
If needed, you can also use this section of the Object tab to apply
effects to text, apply a style to the text, and more.
If you like to mix and match font types, styles, and so on, within a block of
text, double-click the text to activate the Text tool and select the letters or
words in the block of text that you want to style differently. After selecting
the letters or words, open the Object tab of the Properties panel to set the
parameters for the text selection.
Creating text styles
When you add text to a document, FreeHand uses the default Normal Text
style to format the text. You can modify the text using menu commands or
the Object tab in the Properties panel, however, the changes only apply to
the block of text you are creating. If you’re creating a document with lots of
text that spans different pages, formatting each new block of text can
become a nuisance, especially when they’re all the same. After you decide
on text formatting options for a document, you can save the formatting as a
style, which you can then apply to any block of text with a click of the
mouse. To create a text style, follow these steps:
1. Select the Text tool from the Tools panel and create a block of text.
2. Format the text using the font style, size, and other attributes that will
remain constant throughout the document.
3. Choose Window➪Styles or press Shift+F11.
The Styles tab of the Assets panel, shown in Figure 3-7, opens.

Formatting Text
392
4. Click the Options button (the bulleted list icon in the upper-right
corner of the panel) and choose New from the Options menu.
A new entry, in the form of a box with Aa in the middle of it, appears in
the Styles tab. In the Object tab of the Properties panel, you’ll see that
the style will be given the default name of Style, appended by the next
available style number (Style-1, for example). If you’re creating more
than one style for the document, you can rename the style to better
reflect what the style applies to.
After you create a text style, you can apply the style to any text box on any
page in your document. To apply a text style, follow these steps:
1. Select the block of text to which you want to apply a style.
2. Choose Window➪Styles or press Shift+F11.
The Styles tab of the Assets panel opens and all styles currently in use
for the document are displayed.
3. Click the name of the style you want applied to the text.
The text is formatted to the style’s parameters.
In FreeHand MX, renaming a style is a bit more complicated than it was in
previous versions. By default, items in the Styles tab are shown in “Previews
only” format, which is to say they show a small preview of the style itself. To
rename a style, you must first change the layout of the styles to either
“Compact list views” or “Large list views” by clicking the Options button
(the bulleted text icon in the top right of the Assets panel) and selecting a
layout option. After this is complete, you can double-click on your style,
enter a name for it, and press Enter to save it.
Choosing a text color
If language can be colorful, so should text. When you add color to text,
you accentuate the text and make it stand apart from other elements in
Figure 3-7:
You can

an illustration. You can apply the same color to an entire block of text, or
select individual letters from a block of text and choose a different color for
each. To specify the color for a block of text, follow these steps:
1. Select the Pointer tool from the Tools panel, and then click the text
box to select it.
If you only want to apply a color to an individual letter or word in a text
box, double-click the text box to activate the Text tool, and then highlight
the letter or word you want to select a color for.
2. Click the Fill color box (next to the paint bucket) in the Tools panel.
The color picker appears.
3. Click a color to select it.
You’ve got colorful text!
Some illustrators like to choose a different color for the first letter in a para-
graph to draw the viewer’s eye to the paragraph. You can also draw attention
to the first letter in a paragraph by specifying a larger font size.
Aligning your text
When you create a block of text, the text is aligned by default to the left side
of the text box. You can modify the text alignment to suit the illustration
that you are creating. You can change the text alignment at any time by fol-
lowing these steps:
1. Using the Pointer tool from the Tools panel, select the block of text
whose alignment you want to modify.
2. Click the Character button in the Object tab of the Properties panel.
The character properties are displayed. If the Properties panel is not
open to the Object tab, choose Window➪Object or press Ctrl+F3. The
Character button is the one with the “abc” on it.
3. Click the appropriate button to apply one of the following alignments
to the selected text:
• Left: Aligns the text to the left side of the text box; this is the default
alignment. The right side of the text will be ragged.
• Center: Aligns each line of text to the center of the text box.
• Right: Aligns text to the right side of the text box. The left side of the
text will be ragged.
• Justify: Spaces the text so that it flows to fill the text box, leaving no
ragged edges.

Changing paragraph settings
When you create several paragraphs of text in a block, you can change the
formatting of the paragraphs to suit your illustration. You can modify the
paragraph indentation and how the tabs are spaced using the Object tab of
the Properties panel:
1. Select the block of text whose paragraph settings you want to modify
by clicking it with the Pointer tool.
2. Choose Window➪Object or press Ctrl+F3.
The Properties panel opens to the Object tab. 
3. Click the Paragraph button.
The Paragraph section of the Object tab opens, as shown in Figure 3-8.
4. Enter a value in the Above field or in the Below field, or both.
The values you enter in these fields determine how much space appears
above or below the paragraph. If you enter values in both fields,
FreeHand creates a space above and below each paragraph in the
text box.

5. Select the Hanging Punctuation check box to place punctuation, such
as quotation marks, outside of paragraph margins.
6. Enter a value in the Left and Right Indent fields.
These values determine how far a paragraph indents from the left and
right borders of the text box. A positive value indents the text inside the
text box, and a negative value places the text outside the text box or
column.
7. Enter a value in the First Line Indent field.
This value determines how far the first line of a paragraph indents from
the left indent of the paragraph.
8. Select the Hyphenate check box to enable automatic hyphenation for
the block of text. 
9. Press Enter.
Your changes are applied to the selected block of text.
Formatting text in columns and rows
If you like your text neatly arranged, you can do that in FreeHand. You can
format a block of text to be displayed in rows and columns, which is the
equivalent of creating a table. After you format text into columns and rows,
you can control how the text flows between columns and rows. Follow these
steps to format a block of text into columns and rows:
1. Select the block of text you want to format into columns and rows.
2. Choose Window➪Object or press Ctrl+F3.
The Properties panel opens to the Object tab.
3. Click the Columns button (fourth from the top).
The Columns section of the Object tab opens, as shown in Figure 3-9.
4. Enter a value in the Columns field.
This determines the number of columns in the text box.
5. Enter a value in the Column Spacing field.
This value determines the distance between columns.
6. Enter a value in the H field.
This value determines the height of each table cell.
7. Enter a value in the Rows field.
This value determines the number of rows in the text box.

Formatting Text

8. Enter a value in the Row Spacing field.
This value determines the amount of space between the rows in the
text box.
9. Enter a value in the W field.
This value determines the width of each cell.
10. Click the desired Flow button.
The option you choose determines how the text flows within the table.
The left button flows text down all rows in a column and then into the
next column. The right button flows text across all rows and then down
to the next column.
If the text isn’t flowing between rows and columns to your liking, you can
modify text flow by opening the Object tab of the Properties panel, and then
clicking the Adjust Columns button — the bottom button in the list on the
left. When the Adjust Columns section of the Object tab appears, select the
Balance Columns check box to balance the flow between columns.

artistic latitude when a font is almost, but not quite, perfect for your needs.
To scale text horizontally, follow these steps:
1. Using the Pointer tool from the Tools panel, select the block of text
you want to scale.
If you select a block of text with the Pointer tool, the changes will be
applied to all text and subsequent text you enter in the text box. To
scale individual words in a text block, double-click the text box with the
Pointer tool, and then select the word(s) or character(s) you want to
scale.
2. Choose Window➪Object or press Ctrl+F3.
The Properties panel opens to the Object tab.
3. Click the Spacing button.
The Spacing section of the Object tab opens.
4. In the % field, enter the value by which you want the text scaled.
This value is a percentage of the text’s original size. Enter a value larger
than 100 to increase the text width, or lower than 100 to shrink the text.
5. In the Spacing % fields, enter values in the Min, Opt, and Max fields
for Words and Letters:
• Word: The values you enter for Word affect the space between
words in a selected block of text. A value of 100 is the standard spac-
ing for words. Values less than 100 move words closer together, and
values higher than 100 move words apart.
• Letter: The values you enter for Letter change the percentage devia-
tion from the standard spacing between letters. The standard letter
spacing is 0. Enter a higher value for more space between letters and
a lower value to move letters closer together.
To precisely space letters and words, enter the same value in the Min,
Opt, and Max fields.
6. In the Keep Together field, enter a value for the number of lines to be
kept together when scaling text columns.
Enter a value of 2 to prevent the first or last line of a paragraph being
isolated at the top or bottom of a column.
7. Select the Selected Words check box to prevent a line break when
scaling selected text.
8. Close the Properties panel or select another text option to modify.
The selected text is scaled by the values specified.

Copying attributes between text boxes
If you’re like many illustrators, you’ll be working on a document, get a blind-
ing flash of insight, and come up with a better design for something. If this
happens when you’re creating a new block of text, you can quickly copy the
attributes from the new block of text to other text boxes in your document.
You can copy settings from the Text Character, Spacing, and Paragraph sec-
tions of the Object tab of the Properties panel. To copy attributes from one
text box to another, follow these steps:
1. Select the text box whose attributes you want to copy.
2. Choose Edit➪Copy Attributes.
The attributes are copied to the Clipboard.
3. Select the text box to which you want to paste the attributes.
4. Choose Edit➪Paste Attributes.
FreeHand pastes the copied attributes to the selected block of text.
Adding visual effects to text
You can create some pretty snazzy text using FreeHand by selecting an
exciting font and modifying it with the Object tab of the Properties panel. If
you need more pizzazz than that, you can apply visual effects to text. You
can choose from effects like the ever-present drop shadow, or other unique
effects, such as highlighting text. Figure 3-10 shows the effects that you can
choose from.

Follow these steps to add a visual effect to text in a document:
1. Select the Pointer tool from the Tools panel and double-click a text box.
The text is selected and the Text tool is active.
2. Select the text to which you want to apply a visual effect.
You can select an individual letter, a word, or the entire text box.
3. Choose Window➪Object or press Ctrl+F3.
The text properties will show up on the Object tab.
4. Click the Effects button at the bottom-left of the Object tab and
choose one of the following:
• No Effect (the default)
• Strikethrough
• Highlight
• Underline
• Inline
• Zoom
• Shadow
5. Press Enter or click outside the text box.
FreeHand applies the effect to the selected text. Be aware that these
effects will not be retained if the text is converted to paths.
Adjusting the Spacing and Position
of Characters and Lines
When you create paragraph text, you have more options than just font type,
size, and alignment. You can also specify the space between paragraph lines,
which is known as leading. Another parameter you can modify is kerning,
which is the space between two characters. You can also modify the baseline
shift of a word or letter in a block of text, which causes the selected word or
letter to be raised above or below the baseline of the other characters in the
text block.
Adjusting leading
To adjust leading for a block of text, follow these steps:
1. Select the Pointer tool from the Tools panel and click a text box to
select it.
2. Choose Window➪Object or press Ctrl+F3.
The Properties panel opens to the Object tab.

3. Click the Character button.
4. Enter a value in the Leading field.
Enter a number to specify the leading value. The value is applied
according to the option you select in Step 5.
5. Choose one of the following options from the Leading Type drop-
down list:
• Plus (+): Specifies a point value to be added to the current font size.
• Equal (=): Specifies leading equal to a value.
• Percent (%): Specifies leading as a percentage of the current font
size.
6. Close the Properties panel to apply your changes or select another
text parameter to modify.
The change is applied to the selected text box.
Adjusting kerning
To adjust kerning for a block of text, follow these steps:
1. Select the Pointer tool from the Tools panel and click a text box to
select it.
Selecting a text box determines the kerning for the entire block of text,
also known as range kerning. To modify kerning between individual
words or characters, double-click the block of text and place your
cursor between the characters or words for which you want to modify
kerning.
2. Choose Window➪Object or press Ctrl+F3.
The Properties panel opens to the Object tab.
3. Click the Character button.
4. Enter a value in the Kerning field and press Enter.
The value you enter is a percentage of the space of the letter M for the
text font. To decrease the kerning between words or characters, enter
a negative value, such as –10, which will decrease the kerning by 
10 percent.
5. Press Enter, or choose another text parameter to modify.
Your specified kerning is applied to the text.

Adjusting baseline shift
You can modify baseline shift by following these steps:
1. Select the Pointer tool from the Tools panel and double-click the text
box that contains the word or character whose baseline shift you
want to modify.
Your cursor becomes an I-beam.
2. Select the word or character whose baseline shift you want to modify.
The word or character is highlighted.
3. Choose Window➪Object or press Ctrl+F3.
The Properties panel opens to the Object tab.
4. Click the Character button.
5. In the Baseline Shift field, enter the value by which you want the
baseline shifted.
By default, this value is in points. (If you’ve changed to a different unit
of measurement, for example, pixels, the value will be in pixels.) To shift
the selected text above the baseline, enter a positive value. To shift the
selected text below the baseline, enter a negative value. For example,
entering a value of –15 shifts the selected text 15 points below the 
baseline.
6. Press Enter, or choose another text parameter to modify.
The text is shifted by the amount specified.
Working with Text and Paths
When you create a line of text, it flows in a line from point A to point B. This
is the time-honored standard for creating text. But wait, you’re an illustrator,
and FreeHand is an illustration program. You say you want text that swoops
and swirls like a roller coaster? Or perhaps you want your text characters to
look a little different. If that’s your artistic vision, we show you how to
achieve it in the upcoming sections.
Converting text to a path
You can convert a block of text, or a single letter, into a path. When you do
this, the letter or text block is no longer editable as text, but you can have a
field day distorting the text by manipulating points with the Subselection tool
or by using the Freeform tool. (We show you how to use the Subselection
tool in Book IV, Chapter 4.)

Working with Text and Paths
402
If you’re trying to convert text that has special effects being applied to it, be
warned. When you convert the text to a path, you’ll find that your special
effects will disappear.
Here’s how you convert text to a path:
1. Select the block of text that you want to convert to a path.
This technique works best with single letters or initials, for example, the
letters used to make a client’s logo. This technique also works best if
the text is large.
2. Choose Text➪Convert to Paths or press Ctrl+Shift+P.
FreeHand converts the text to a vector object. Characters with counters
(holes: e, g, b, d, o, a, and so on) become Compound Paths. Figure 3-11
shows a letter after being converted to paths. The converted letter has
been further modified with the Freeform tool.
Aligning text to a path
If you (or your client) have the hankering for an illustration with unique
text, you can easily achieve this goal by attaching text to a path. You create
text that swoops and swirls by attaching text to an open path, or you can
create stylized text by attaching it to a closed path, such as an ellipse. To
align text to a path:
1. Select the text and the path.
You can select both objects by dragging the Pointer tool around the text
and the path, or by selecting either the text or the path, and then select-
ing the other while holding down the Shift key.
2. Choose Text➪Attach to Path or press Ctrl+Shift+Y.
The text develops a magnetic attraction for the path.

After you’ve attached your text to a path, you can move the text along the
path if it isn’t exactly where you want it. See the “Modifying the alignment of
text along a path” section, later in this chapter, for details. 
Aligning text to both sides of an ellipse
Another effect that you can achieve with FreeHand is attaching text to the
top and bottom of an ellipse. If you have a client that wants you to display
text above and below a logo, this is the path — pun intended — to take. To
attach text to the top and bottom of an ellipse, follow these steps:
1. Create an ellipse.
For more information on creating an ellipse, see Book IV, Chapter 4.
2. Use the Text tool to create a block of text.
Create the text that appears above and below the ellipse in the same
text block. Press Enter after you create the text that appears above the
ellipse, and then type the second line of text.
3. Select the ellipse, and then while pressing the Shift key, select the
text.
4. Choose Text➪Attach to Path.
The text on the first line attaches to the top of the ellipse, and the text
on the second line attaches to the bottom of the ellipse, as shown in
Figure 3-12.
If you have an object in your illustration and you want a block of text to flow
around it, select the object and move it so it overlaps the text. Then choose
Modify➪Arrange➪Bring to Front to bring the object in front of the text.
Then choose Text➪Flow Around Selection. In the Flow Around Selection
dialog box that appears, click the Text Wrap button (the button on the
right), and then in the text fields, enter the size of the margins you want
between the text and the object.
Figure 3-12:
You can

to both the
top and
bottom of

Working with Text and Paths
404
You can flow text inside an object. Create an object, such as an ellipse or
polygon, and then create a block of text. Select the text and object, and then
choose Text➪Flow Inside Path. Whoosh! The text appears inside the shape.
Modifying the alignment of text along a path
After you attach text to a path, you can modify where the text aligns to the
path. You can modify which side of the path text appears on, as well as
move the text to a different point along the path. To modify the alignment of
text along a path, follow these steps:
1. Using the Pointer tool from the Tools panel, select the text whose
alignment along a path you need to change.
2. Choose Window➪Object or press Ctrl+F3.
The Object tab in the Properties panel opens.
3. Select the Show Path check box if you want the path displayed as well
as the text.
4. From the Top and Bottom Alignment drop-down list, select one of the
following:
• None: Select this option if the text is attached to a path that is not
visible.
• Baseline: Aligns the baseline of the text to the path.
• Ascent: Aligns the text to the bottom of the path.
• Descent: Aligns the text to the top of the path.
5. From the Orientation drop-down list, select one of the following
options:
• Rotate around path: Orients the text with the rotation of the path.
• Vertical: Orients the text vertically to the path.
• Skew Horizontal: Skews the text horizontally along the path.
• Skew Vertical: Skews the text vertically along the path.
6. In the Inset section, enter a value in the Left field, and then press
Enter to move the text to a different position along the path.
This is the distance you want the text offset to the right along the path.
If the text is attached to an ellipse, enter a negative value to move the
text to the left.
When you enter a value in the Left field, the value in the Right field is
automatically updated. For example, if you enter a value of 10 in the Left
field, this value is added to the Right field. The value in the Right field is
where the text ends. If you’re a math whiz, you can enter a value in the
Right field, however, it’s easier to enter a value in the Left field.

If you prefer, you can change the text alignment along a path by manually
moving it. To manually align text along a path, follow these steps:
1. Use the Pointer tool from the Tools panel to select the block of text
whose alignment to a path you want to modify.
The text is selected and a small triangle appears to the left of the text,
as shown in Figure 3-13.
2. Click the triangle and drag the text to a new location along the path.
As you drag the triangle, FreeHand creates a gray shape the size of the
text that gives you a preview of the current location of the text along
the path.
3. Release the mouse button when the text is in the desired location.

hen you create an illustration in FreeHand MX, you have a multitude
of options to work with. With a bit of practice, you can create some
interesting shapes for your illustrations and modify them to suit your artis-
tic muse or your client’s vision. The results you can achieve are only limited
by your imagination and sense of experimentation. The FreeHand tools,
although many, are relatively simple to use, which gives you the freedom
to concentrate on your creation without having to worry about an overly
complicated tool.
In this chapter, we show you how to create an illustration using the mar-
velous array of tools in FreeHand. We explain how to use the available tools
to create shapes, and then use panels or other tools to modify those shapes.
In Book IV, Chapter 5, we show you how to transform the shapes you create
to put your own unique touch on an illustration.
Using Predefined Shapes
In Book IV, Chapter 2, we introduce the shape tools. The shape tools look kind
of ho-hum when you see them in the Tools panel; but when you click one of
them and use it to add a shape to your illustration, things start looking up.
And if you double-click an innocuous little tool button, you may get a dialog
box with tool options that allow you to modify the base shape into something
truly cool, or modify the way the tool draws. In this section, we show you how
to use the shape tools to create shapely shapes. We also point out which tools
have additional options. Figure 4-1 shows the shape tools and the shapes you
can create with them.

Using Predefined Shapes
408
Creating rectangles and squares
If you need a rectangle in your illustration, or its equally dimensioned
cousin, the square, you use the Rectangle tool. Rectangles make wonderful
borders for Web site headers or frames for text. If your illustration calls for
rectangles with rounded corners, the Rectangle tool can give you this as
well. To add a rectangle to your illustration, follow these steps:
1. Select the Rectangle tool from the Tools panel. (Refer to Figure 4-1).
If you’re creating a garden-variety rectangle, skip to Step 5. If you want a
rectangle with pizzazz, read on.
2. Double-click the Rectangle tool.
The Rectangle Tool dialog box appears.
3. To make the corners rounded, enter a value for the corner radius.
Enter a low value for gently rounded corners, or a high value for corners
with curves that rival those of an Italian sports car.
4. Click OK.
The dialog box goes on hiatus until you double-click the tool again.

5. Click and drag inside the document to draw the rectangle.
As you drag, FreeHand draws a bounding box to give you a preview of
the shape’s current size. If you hold down the Shift key while dragging,
you constrain the shape to a square. If you hold down the Alt key, the
shape is created from the center outward.
6. Release the mouse button when the shape is the desired size.
FreeHand creates the rectangle.
Creating polygons
If you like many-sided shapes, the Polygon tool’s got your name written all
over it. Actually, it has a polygonal shape emblazoned on it, but you can sat-
isfy your need for many-sided shapes with this tool. You can create poly-
gons and star-shaped objects with the Polygon tool. You’ll also be happy to
know that you can specify how many sides the shape has. To create a poly-
gon, follow these steps:
1. Select the Polygon tool (refer to Figure 4-1) by clicking and holding
on the Rectangle tool and selecting Polygon when the pop-up menu
appears.
You can create a polygon using the tool’s current settings by clicking
and dragging inside the document. For other options, you need to open
the Polygon Tool dialog box.
2. Double-click the Polygon tool.
The Polygon Tool dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 4-2.
3. Drag the slider to specify the number of sides.
Alternatively, you can enter a value higher than 3 in the field. The slider
stops at 20, but you can manually enter any number in the field. (If you
create a polygon with lots of sides, it ends up looking like a circle.)

4. Select the Polygon or Star radio button.
This determines whether you draw a polygon or a star. If you select Star,
you can specify the angle of the sides by following the next step. If you
select Polygon, you’re done; go to Step 7.
5. In the Star Points section, select Automatic or Manual.
If you select Automatic, FreeHand determines the angle based on the
number of sides you specify.
6. If you specify Manual, drag the slider to specify the angle of the star
sides.
As you drag the slider, the preview window refreshes to show you the
star’s shape with the current settings.
7. Click OK.
The dialog box closes.
8. Click and drag inside the document to create the shape.
As you drag, FreeHand creates a preview that shows the current size of
the shape. Hold down the Shift key while dragging to create a shape that
is as wide as it is tall. Hold down the Alt key to draw the shape from the
center out.
9. Release the mouse button when the shape is the desired size.
A star is born. That is, unless you choose the Polygon option.
Creating ellipses
The ellipse is a wonderful shape, a curved wonder that makes ends meet. If
your illustration calls for a circular or oval shape, the Ellipse tool is right up
your alley. And if you’re creating an illustration of a bowling alley, you can
use the Ellipse tool to create a bowling ball and use the Rectangle tool to
create an alley. To create a shape with the Ellipse tool:
1. Select the Ellipse tool by clicking on it in the Tools panel.
It’s the tool with a circle for an icon. (Refer to Figure 4-1.) The Ellipse
tool has no parameters to modify.
2. Click the spot in the document where you want to create an ellipse
and then drag diagonally.
As you drag the tool, FreeHand creates a preview of the shape’s size. If
you hold down the Shift key while dragging, you constrain the shape to
a circle. If you hold down the Alt key, you create the shape from the
center out.
3. Release the mouse button when the ellipse is the desired size.
FreeHand creates the ellipse.

Creating spirals
If you’re familiar with previous versions of FreeHand, you might initially think
that the Spiral tool was phased out in FreeHand MX. Not true! The Spiral tool
just has been buried a bit more in the interface. Spirals are fun shapes that
you can use to good effect when creating whimsical illustrations. You can use
a spiral to create a reasonable facsimile of a corkscrew, just the thing if your
client sells fine — or not so fine — wines. To add a spiral to an illustration,
follow these steps:
1. Select the Spiral tool by clicking and holding down on the Line tool in
the Tools panel, and then selecting Spiral from the pop-up menu. (It
looks like a wound-too-tight spring.)
You can create a spiral using the tool’s current settings by dragging in
the document. If you want a custom spiral, take the following steps.
2. Double-click the tool.
The Spiral dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 4-3.
3. In the Spiral Type section, select one of the following options:
• Click the left button to create a spiral with an evenly spaced, concen-
tric radius.
• Click the right button to create a spiral with an expanding radius
that becomes wider with each spiral. When you click the right
button, an extra option appears. Drag the slider to set the expansion
rate. Alternatively, you can enter a value in the text field.
4. From the Draw By drop-down list, select one of the following options
to specify the manner in which FreeHand draws the spiral:
• Rotations: Choose this option to specify the number of rotations the
spiral has, regardless of its size. When you choose this option, set
the number of rotations by dragging the slider. Alternatively, you can
enter a value in the text field.
Figure 4-3:
Use this
dialog box
to specify
how your

Creating Freeform Shapes
412
• Increments: Choose this option to create more rotations as the
spiral grows larger. When you choose this option, specify the spac-
ing between each interval by dragging the slider or by entering a
value in the Increment Width text field. To create a shape with
expanding spirals, enter a value in the Start Radius text field.
5. From the Draw From drop-down list, select one of the following
options:
• Center: Choose this option, and you draw the spiral by clicking the
center point and then dragging to place the spiral’s ending point.
• Corner: Choose this option, and you draw the spiral by clicking to
place one ending point of the spiral and then dragging to set the other.
• Edge: Choose this option, and you draw the spiral by clicking to
create the end point and then clicking to set to center point.
6. Click a Direction button to determine which way your spiral swirls.
Click the left button for a counterclockwise spiral, the right button for a
clockwise spiral.
7. Click OK.
The Spiral dialog box closes.
8. Click anywhere in the document and then drag to define the size of
the spiral.
As you drag, FreeHand creates a preview of the spiral’s current size.
Hold down the Alt key to draw the spiral from the center, regardless of
the option you choose in the Spiral dialog box.
9. Release the mouse button when the spiral is the desired size.
FreeHand draws the spiral.
Creating Freeform Shapes
The Pencil tools represent another major interface change in FreeHand MX.
In the previous version of FreeHand, a single Pencil tool had three formats:
Freehand, Variable Stroke, and Calligraphic Pen.
Now, in FreeHand MX, these functions are separated into their own tools:
✦Pencil tool (formerly Freehand tool): Draws a simple line the width of
the currently selected stroke.
✦Variable Stroke Pen tool: Creates an artistic brush-like stroke.
✦Calligraphic Pen tool: Creates a stroke that looks like it was created
with a calligrapher’s pen.

Book IV
Chapter 4
Creating
Illustrations with
FreeHand MX
Creating Freeform Shapes
413
You can use these tools to create anything from a simple squiggly line to an
expressive calligraphic stroke. The following sections show how best to
utilize these three tools.
When you use the tools, keep in mind that if you set attributes for the stroke
and fill while you have the Pointer tool selected, those attributes become
the default attributes for all the drawing tools. You may find it advantageous
to set the Stroke and Fill attributes with the Pointer tool selected, before
you begin using the three tools we introduce in this section. You can change
the default attributes at any time by selecting a non-drawing tool (like the
Pointer or Subselection tool) and editing them. And, of course, you can set
attributes different from the defaults as you use each of the tools.
Using the Pencil tool
To use the Pencil tool, follow these steps:
1. Select the Pencil tool from the Tools panel.
To create a line using the tool’s current settings, click inside the docu-
ment and drag to create the line.
2. For more options, double-click the Pencil tool.
The Pencil Tool dialog box, shown in Figure 4-4, opens.
3. Drag the slider next to the Precision field.
This setting determines how much FreeHand smoothes the line as you
draw. Choose a low value to smooth minor variations as you draw, or
choose a high value to allow minor variations as you draw. Alternatively,
you can enter a value in the text field.
4. Select the Draw Dotted Line check box.
This setting is optional. If you select it, FreeHand creates a dotted line
preview as you draw (note that the actual line you draw will be solid;
only the preview will be dotted). This option speeds redraw and is rec-
ommended if you use FreeHand on a computer with a slower processor.
Figure 4-4:

and more.

Creating Freeform Shapes
414
5. Click OK.
The Pencil Tool dialog box closes.
6. Click and drag inside the document to create a line.
As you drag the tool across the document, FreeHand creates a preview
of the line. If you hold down the Alt and Shift keys while using the tool,
you constrain the line to a predefined angle. (To predefine the angle,
choose File➪Document Settings➪Constrain and enter a value in the
dialog box; the default angle is 45 degrees). 
7. If you choose the Variable Stroke tool or Calligraphic Pen tool by
clicking and holding the Pencil tool and selecting either tool from the
pop-up menu, you can vary the stroke by 1⁄8 of the tool’s Width set-
ting by doing one of the following as you draw:
• To decrease the stroke width, press the left-arrow key.
• To increase the stroke width, press the right-arrow key.
• If you draw with a pressure-sensitive tablet, vary the pressure you
apply to the tablet to vary the stroke width.
8. Release the mouse button when the line is the desired length.
FreeHand draws the line. At this point, you can add to the line by placing
the tool over the last or first point. Your cursor becomes a plus sign (+),
indicating that the path can be extended.
Using the Variable Stroke Pen tool
The Variable Stroke Pen tool is a handy tool when you’re looking to make
swoopy lines that go from being small to large, or vice versa. To use the
tool, just follow these steps:
1. Select the Variable Stroke Pen tool from the Tools panel by clicking
and holding the Pencil tool and selecting the Variable Stroke Pen tool
from the pop-up menu that appears.
If you start drawing with it, it will make a line that looks just like the
Pencil tool. However, for more magic, continue through the following
steps.
2. Double-click the Variable Stroke Pen tool.
The Variable Stroke Pen dialog box opens.
3. Set your precision and dotted line options.
You can change the precision of the line by dragging the slider or by
entering a number in the Precision field. 1 is the smallest value, and 10 is
the highest. The higher the number, the more points FreeHand will add
to the lines you create, giving you more precise control over the line. If

Book IV
Chapter 4
Creating
Illustrations with
FreeHand MX
Creating Freeform Shapes
415
you want the preview of the line as you draw (but not the line itself) to
be dotted instead of solid, select the Draw Dotted Line check box. 
4. Select the Auto Remove Overlap check box if you want FreeHand to
create composite paths when line segments overlap, rather than keep-
ing the lines discreet. 
5. Set the minimum and maximum width of the stroke.
You can either use the sliders to change the values in each of the fields
or manually input the min and max values. 
6. Click OK to save your settings. 
When you have your settings saved, you can really experience the
magic of this tool. As you’re drawing, hold down the right- or left-arrow
keys to dynamically increase or decrease the width of the line. 
Using the Calligraphic Pen tool
The Calligraphic Pen tool is not likely to be your first tool of choice, but it is
equally as cool as the Pencil tool and the Variable Stroke Pen tool. Practically
speaking, the Calligraphic Pen tool is a tool that you should really only use if
you’re drawing using a pressure-sensitive tablet — but if you can write callig-
raphy using a mouse or a trackball, more power to you! As you would expect,
this tool creates angled lines, similar to a calligraphy pen. 
You use the tool like you use the others, by selecting it from the menu that
pops up when you click and hold the Pencil tool in the Tools panel.
Similarly, you can double-click the tool to bring up the Calligraphic Pen
dialog box. There, you can specify the following items:
✦Precision: The number of points associated with the calligraphic line
you’re drawing. The higher the number, the more points on the line. 
✦Draw Dotted Line: Select this check box if you want the preview of the
line you’re drawing to be dotted as you draw instead of solid. Only
the preview of the line is dotted; the drawn line’s stroke and fill (as
set in the Object tab of the Properties panel) appear when you release
the mouse button.
✦Auto Remove Overlap: Select this check box if you want FreeHand to
create composite paths when line segments overlap, rather than keep-
ing the lines discreet. 
✦Width: Select the Fixed or the Variable radio button to choose a width.
If you choose Variable, you can enter values for the minimum and maxi-
mum width for the line. 
✦Angle: Click and hold on the wheel to change the angle of the line. This
angle will make your line more or less angular, depending upon the
value you choose. 

Selecting Objects
416
Selecting Objects
When you create a document and add stuff (a technical term for objects) to
the illustration, you place the stuff where you think it belongs. Thankfully,
your initial placement isn’t cast in stone. If you need to move, or otherwise
modify, an object, you have to first select it. If the object you’re modifying is
a path, you can select individual points along the path. In the upcoming sec-
tions, we show you how to use the Selection tools to select stuff.
Using the Pointer tool
You use the Pointer tool to select an object or several objects in your docu-
ment. To use the Pointer tool, select it from the Tools panel (it’s at the top
left of the panel, with the solid black left-pointing arrow for an icon) and do
one of the following:
✦Click an object to select it. If the object has no fill, click the object’s
stroke (the border line that makes up the object).
✦Click and drag a marquee around several objects to select them.
✦Click an object, and then while holding down the Shift key, click other
objects to add them to the selection.
After selecting an object or group of objects, dots appear to signify the
border of each object or group. You can now drag the objects to a different
location or use the Object panel of the Properties panel to change the
parameters of the object(s). If you select a path, the dots that comprise
the path appear.
If you are using a tool other than the Pointer tool, you can momentarily select
the Pointer tool by pressing and holding the Ctrl key. Use the tool to select
objects; release the Ctrl key to revert to the previous tool.
The Pointer, Subselection, and Lasso tools share common settings. The
Subselection tool is the white-headed arrow to the right of the Pointer
tool; the Lasso tool is directly beneath the Subselection tool. By default,
objects or points must be completely encompassed by a marquee in order
to be selected. You can vary the sensitivity of these tools by doing the 
following:
1. Double-click the Pointer tool, Subselection tool, or Lasso tool.
The tool’s dialog box appears.
2. Select the Contact Sensitivity option.
Select this option if you want the ability to select objects that are only
partially encompassed by a marquee. This option is deselected by
default.

3. Click OK.
The new settings are applied to the tool and remain in effect until you
open the dialog box and choose a different option.
Using the Subselection tool
You use the Subselection tool to select individual objects, select individual
points along a path, or select an object that is nestled within a group. To
make a selection with the Subselection tool, follow these steps:
1. Select the Subselection tool from the Tools panel.
It’s the tool with the icon that looks like a hollow arrow pointing left.
You find it right next to the Pointer tool at the top of the Tools panel.
To momentarily select the Subselection tool while using the Pointer
tool, hold down the Alt key. After using the Subselection tool, release
the Alt key to revert to the Pointer tool.
2. To make a selection, do one of the following:
• Click an object. This selects an object, even when it’s in a group.
• Click a path to select it.
• Click an individual point along a path. Note that you must first select
the path, and then select the point.
• Select a group of points by dragging a marquee around them.
3. After creating a selection, you can move it with the Pointer tool.
To momentarily select the Subselection tool while using a tool other than
the Pointer tool, hold down the Ctrl+Alt keys. Release the keys to return to
the previously used tool.
To modify a path between two points, select the path with the Subselection
tool, and then click and drag anywhere between two points. As you drag,
FreeHand modifies the path between the two points.
The Subselection tool has a few other nifty tricks up its sleeve: You can use
it to modify the radius of corners on rectangles and polygons (simply click
any corner and drag toward the center of the shape), or to create arcs in
ellipses (simply click the handle and drag toward the center of the ellipse;
when you release the mouse button, your ellipse becomes a PacMan!). 
Using the Lasso tool
You use the Lasso tool to select objects by drawing a shape around them
instead of by clicking them. To make a selection with the Lasso tool (the
tool that looks like a cowboy’s lariat), follow these steps:

Editing Objects with the Object Tab
418
1. Select the Lasso tool by clicking it on the Tools panel.
2. Click and drag to define a marquee around the object(s) you want to
select.
FreeHand creates a dashed bounding box, giving you a preview of the
selection area.
3. Release the mouse button when the bounding box surrounds the
object(s) you want to select.
The objects are selected. You can now move the objects with the
Pointer tool or modify them in the Object tab of the Properties panel.
Editing Objects with the Object Tab
The completely overhauled FreeHand Object tab in the Properties panel
is a multifaceted workhorse you use to change a variety of parameters,
depending on the object you select. In FreeHand MX, you can control the
stroke, fill, and effects of an object, all from this single interface. When you
select an object with the Pointer tool, the Object tab of the Properties panel
automatically displays the current stroke, fill, and effect parameters for that
object, as shown in Figure 4-5. If the object is a rectangle, ellipse, or polygon,
the panel also shows its size and position information, all of which can be
edited on the Object tab. For rectangles and polygons, you also have access
to corner properties.
To change an object’s position and size, follow these steps:
1. Using the Pointer tool, select the object whose characteristics you
want to modify.
2. Choose Window➪Object or press Ctrl+F3.
The Object tab of the Properties panel opens. If the selected object is a
rectangle, polygon, or ellipse, the tab displays the object’s dimensions
Figure 4-5:

newly
revised
Object tab.

and location. If the selected object is an open or closed path, the tab
displays the object’s stroke, fill, number of points in the path, odd or
even fill, whether the path is open or closed, and the flatness of the
curve. In order to see the position, group the object.
3. To change the position of the object, enter new values in the X and/or
Y fields.
4. To change the object’s dimensions, enter new values in the Width
and/or Height fields.
Note that this does not resize the object proportionately unless the
ratio of the new values you entered in the width and height fields
matches the ratio of the original values.
5. Press Enter to apply the changes.
The object is resized and/or repositioned. You can close the Properties
panel, or leave it floating in the workspace.
A number of other powerful options reside within the Object tab of the
Properties panel, specifically those that add and edit strokes, fills, and
effects. These options are all covered in detail in Book IV, Chapter 5.
Grouping and Ungrouping Objects
At times, it’s advantageous to create a group of objects. When you select
several objects and create a group, the group behaves as a single object.
You can move the group with the Pointer tool, resize the group with the
Object tab of the Properties panel, and modify the stroke and fill of every
object in the group at once by changing the stroke and fill settings in the oft-
mentioned Object tab. If you need to edit an individual object in a group,
select it with the Subselection tool, and then perform the needed task.
You can create a group at any time, for example, when you’ve arranged sev-
eral elements to create an illustration of a face. You can create a group by
selecting objects from different layers. When you do this, the objects are
moved to the current drawing layer, yet they retain their stacking order. To
create a group, follow these steps:
1. Select the objects you want to group.
You can select objects with the Pointer tool, Subselection tool, or Lasso
tool.
2. Choose Modify➪Group.
Four dots appear to signify the border of the group.

Arranging Objects
420
After you have created a group, you can select an individual object in the
group by doing one of the following:
✦Select the Subselection tool and click the object you want to select.
✦Select the Pointer tool, hold down the Alt key, and click the object you
want to select.
If you have objects underneath other objects in a group, you can select
them by holding down the Ctrl and Alt keys while right-clicking to cycle
through the objects in the group.
To ungroup objects, follow these steps:
1. Select the object group with the Pointer tool.
2. Choose Modify➪Ungroup.
The group is disbanded, and you can now edit each object individually.
Yoko goes into hiding.
After you create a group, you can nest another object or group by selecting
the object or group, selecting the object or group you want to nest the item
in, and then choosing Modify➪Group.
Arranging Objects
When you add objects to an illustration, they are stacked on top of each
other, and the objects on top of the stack in a layer eclipse the objects
below. You can change the stacking order of objects at any time by following
these steps:
1. Use the Pointer or Subselection tool to select the object whose order
in the stack you want to rearrange.
2. Choose Modify➪Arrange and choose one of the following commands
from the submenu:
• Bring to Front: Moves the selected object to the front of the stack.
• Move Forward: Moves the selected object ahead of the next object
in the stack.
• Move Backward: Moves the selected object behind the next lower
object in the stack.
• Send to Back: Moves the selected object to the back of the stack.
After applying one of the Arrange commands, the object’s order in the
stacking layer is changed.

Book IV
Chapter 4

Illustrations with
FreeHand MX
Aligning Objects with the Align Panel
421
When you use the Arrange command, you modify the stacking order on
the drawing layer. If there are layers above or below the drawing layer (the
currently selected layer), objects on those layers will affect the overall
appearance of your illustration. In order to achieve the desired result, you
may have to move the object to another layer. For more information on
layers, see Book IV, Chapter 2.
You can also modify the stacking order by cutting or copying an object,
selecting an object in the document, and then choosing Edit➪Special➪Paste
in Front or choosing Edit➪Special➪Paste Behind. Note that this changes the
stacking order, but not the position of the pasted object.
Aligning Objects with the Align Panel
When you have several objects in a document, you may need to align them.
This is a fairly easy process using FreeHand’s object chiropractor: the Align
panel. You use the Align panel to align objects to each other or to the docu-
ment. You can also use the Align panel to distribute objects relative to the
other objects in the selection or relative to the document. When you choose
one of the distribution options, the objects are spaced equally. You can also
use the panel to align points along a path.
To align objects, follow these steps:
1. Use the Pointer or Subselection tool to select the objects or points you
want to align.
2. Choose Window➪Align.
The Align and Transform panel, shown in Figure 4-6, appears, open to
the Align tab. The tab consists of two drop-down lists on the right and a
preview window on the left. The preview window gives you an abstract
visual representation of the currently selected options.
The preview window has nine squares in the center and four mitered
edges. You can align the objects by double-clicking one of these squares
or mitered edges. For example, if you double-click the mitered edge at
the top of the window, objects are aligned to the top; double-click the
mitered edge on the left side and objects are aligned to the left. If you
double-click the square in the top-right corner, objects are aligned to
the top and right; double-click the square in the center and objects are
aligned to the center. The drop-down lists update to match the preview
window. Likewise, when you select options from the drop-down lists,
the preview window updates to display an idealized representation
of the chosen list option. The following steps walk you through select-
ing the options.

Aligning Objects with the Align Panel
422
3. Select the Align to Page check box to align or distribute objects rela-
tive to the page.
This aligns selected objects relative to the page. For example, objects
can be aligned to the top-right corner of the page. If this option is not
selected, objects are aligned or distributed relative to their current posi-
tions in the document. For example, if you have selected several objects
in the document, and you double-click the left edge with the Align to
Page option selected, the objects are aligned to the left border of the
document. Without this option selected, all the objects are aligned to
the leftmost of the selected objects.
4. To align the selected objects, do one of the following:
• Click one of the squares or edges in the Alignment window.
• Select one of the following options from the Horizontal drop-down
list: No Change, Align Top, Align Center, or Align Bottom.
• Select one of the following options from the Vertical drop-down list:
No Change, Align Left, Align Center, or Align Right.
5. To distribute the selected objects, do the following:
• Select one of the following options from the Horizontal drop-down list:
No Change, Distribute Tops, Distribute Centers, Distribute Bottoms,
or Distribute Heights. For example, if you select the Distribute Tops
option, the objects are equally spaced according to the top of each
object.
• Select one of the following options from the Vertical drop-down list:
No Change, Distribute Lefts, Distribute Centers, Distribute Rights, or
Distributes Widths. For example, if you select the Distribute Lefts
option, selected objects are distributed (spaced) according to the
left side of each object.
6. Click the Apply button.
The objects are aligned or distributed according to the options you
select. If the alignment or distribution isn’t as you’d expect — this may
happen the first few times you use the panel — choose Edit➪Undo (or
press Ctrl+Z), and then perform the alignment or distribution again.

Slicing Objects with the Knife Tool
423
Slicing Objects with the Knife Tool
You can use the Knife tool to create two paths from a closed path, such as a
circle or rectangle, or you can use the tool to slice an open path in two. For
example, you can use the Knife tool on a circle or oval to create a curved
path that otherwise would be difficult to create.
After you slice an object or path one time, you are left with two editable paths.
If you use the Knife tool to take several swipes at the shape, you’re left with a
lot of editable paths. You can vary the Knife tool settings to vary the width of
the slice, and whether the tool makes a straight slice or freehand slice.
To use the Knife tool, follow these steps:
1. Use the Pointer tool to select the object or path you want to slice.
2. Select the Knife tool from the Tools panel.
You can use the tool using the previous settings or change the settings.
3. Double-click the Knife tool to change the settings.
The Knife Tool dialog box, shown in Figure 4-7, appears.
4. Select one of the following Tool Operation options:
• Freehand: Select this default option to make a freehand cut. If you
hold down the Alt and Shift keys while using the tool, you constrain
the line to a predefined angle (to predefine the angle, choose
File➪Document Settings➪Constrain and enter a value in the dialog
box; the default angle is 45 degrees).
• Straight: Select this option to make a straight cut. Hold down the
Shift key to constrain the tool to horizontal when dragging left to
right, vertical when dragging up or down, or 45 degrees from the
horizontal when dragging diagonally.

5. Drag the Width slider to determine the tool’s effective cutting area.
A value of 0 creates a thin cut, while higher values create two cuts sepa-
rated by the width you choose. Alternatively, you can enter a value in
the Width text field.
6. Select one of the following check boxes:
• Close Cut Paths: Select this check box, and FreeHand closes the
paths you create with the tool and displays the stroke and fill of the
original path.
• Tight Fit: Select this check box, and the tool closely follows the path
you draw with your mouse or tablet.
7. Click OK.
The Knife Tool dialog box closes.
8. Click and drag across the object.
As you drag, FreeHand displays the tool’s path.
9. Release the mouse button to complete the operation.
FreeHand slices and dices the shape into paths.
After you use the Knife tool, you have two (or more) paths. To select an indi-
vidual path, select the Pointer tool and click anywhere outside of the docu-
ment to deselect any selected paths. You can then click a path to select it,
and then move it to a different location or modify it using the Object tab of
the Properties panel.

hanks to the diversity of the software toolset and menu commands,
FreeHand MX allows you to put your own stamp of creativity on your
designs by creating preset shapes and modifying the shapes to suit your
creative muse (and your client). In addition to modifying shapes, you can
combine two or more shapes to create something truly unique.
In this chapter, we show you how to modify shapes with tools and menu
commands. We also show you how to create new shapes by blending one
shape into another, by using the Combine menu commands to combine
shapes, by cutting one shape from another, and more.
Working with Bitmap Images
Vector objects are FreeHand’s claim to fame; however, sometimes you have
to add a photo or other bitmap image to an illustration. If you use FreeHand
to create brochures, flyers, or package designs, you’ll probably need to
incorporate bitmaps into your work.
You can import images that have been saved in the following formats: TIFF,
EPS, GIF, JPEG, PICT (Mac only), PNG, Targa, and BMP (PC only). After you
have a bitmap image in an illustration, you can modify the bitmap using cer-
tain menu commands and the Xtra tools. For example, you can scale, skew,
flip, or rotate the bitmap. You can also use the drawing tools to augment a

bitmap image. For example, you can use the Rectangle tool to create a snazzy
border for a bitmap. You can also use the Text tool to plop some text on top of
the bitmap. To import a bitmap, follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪Import.
The Import Document dialog box appears.
2. Navigate to the folder that contains the bitmap you want to import.
3. Select the bitmap file and click the Open button.
Your cursor becomes a right angle. This signifies the upper-left corner
of the bitmap image you are importing.
4. Click the spot in the document where you want the bitmap to appear.
The bitmap is placed in the document and the Pointer tool becomes
active. You can now move, scale, skew, flip, or rotate the bitmap.
To create a snazzy border or frame for the bitmap, select the Rectangle tool
from the Tools panel and create a rectangle slightly bigger than the bitmap.
Choose Modify➪Arrange➪Send Backward to move the rectangle behind the
bitmap. You may wish to center the rectangle and bitmap by choosing
Modify➪Align➪Center Horizontal and Modify➪Align➪Center Vertical. You
can then use one of the Xtras tools or operations to modify the rectangle
(Emboss works well), and then group the bitmap and rectangle. We show
you how to use the Xtras tools in the upcoming section, “Using the Xtra
Tools to Change a Shape.”
Modifying Objects
You have a great deal of latitude in how you can modify an object after you
create it. You can scale, skew, flip, or rotate an object using menu commands
or tools. In the upcoming sections, we show you how to accomplish these
object makeovers without breaking a sweat. The tools you can use to modify
objects all live in the FreeHand Tools panel, though some less-used tools are
hidden behind the more popular ones. Figure 5-1 shows the tools you com-
monly use to modify objects.
If you’re a perfectionist, you probably prefer to move and resize objects
with mathematical precision. Don’t be alarmed. There are others like you in
the world. In fact, many of them are graphic designers, which is why
Macromedia created menu commands to scale, resize, and move objects.
The cool thing about these commands is that when you invoke one, the
others all pop up in the Transform tab of the Align and Transform panel.
Talk about convenience. In the upcoming sections, we show you how to use
each command.

Scaling graphics
Sometimes you make things just a bit too large and you’ve got to cut them
down to size, or vice versa. For an object in your illustration, you cut it
down to size (or make it bigger) by scaling it. You can scale an object manu-
ally, or you can use a menu command.
Scaling graphics manually
You can scale an object manually either from one of its corners or from its
center. To scale the object from one of its corners, follow these simple steps:
1. Select the Pointer or Subselection tool from the Tools panel.
2. Click any corner and drag left, right, up, or down.
Dragging away from the object will increase the size of the object.
Dragging into the object will make it smaller. Hold down the Shift key
while you drag to change the size proportionately. As you drag,
FreeHand displays the outline of the shape’s current size.
3. Release the mouse button when the shape is the desired size.
FreeHand resizes the object.
Figure 5-1:
You use
these tools

To scale an object from its center, just follow these steps:
1. Select the Scale tool from the Tools panel.
The Scale tool is the one that has a black arrow inside a blue square.
When you place the cursor over the page, it becomes a small circle with
four long and four short lines radiating out.
2. Click inside the object and drag left, right, up, or down.
Dragging left makes the object narrower; dragging right makes it wider.
Dragging up makes the object taller; dragging down makes it shorter. To
scale the object proportionately, hold down the Shift key as you drag
left or down to make the object smaller or right or up to make it larger.
As you drag the tool, FreeHand displays the outline of the shape’s 
current size.
3. Release the mouse button when the shape is the desired size.
FreeHand resizes the object.
Using the Scale command
To resize an object with mathematical precision, you can use the Scale com-
mand. If that’s the route you want to take, follow these steps:
1. Use the Pointer or Subselection tool to select the object you want to
scale.
2. Choose Modify➪Transform➪Scale or double-click the Scale tool in
the Tools panel.
The Transform tab of the Align and Transform panel opens to the Scale
section, as shown in Figure 5-2.
3. Enter a value in the Scale field.
This value is the percentage of the object’s original size. Enter a value
larger than 100 to increase the object’s size; enter a value lower than
100 to decrease the size.

4. Select one or more of the following check boxes:
• Contents: Scales the contents of a clipping path with the rest of the
path.
• Fills: Scales the object fill as you scale the object.
• Strokes: Scales the object’s stroke as you scale the object.
5. Select the Uniform check box to scale the object proportionately.
This is the default scaling option. If you deselect this check box, the
H and V fields appear. To scale the object vertically, enter a value in
the V field; to scale the object horizontally, enter a value in the H field,
or enter the desired values in both fields to scale both dimensions.
6. In the Center section, enter values in the X and/or Y fields.
Changing the value in either field moves the object’s center of rotation.
7. Enter a value in the Copies field to create copies of the object as you
scale it.
When you enter a value in this field, FreeHand leaves the original object
unaltered and creates the number of copies you specify. Each copy
will be incrementally larger or smaller, creating copies that are sized
incrementally along a path between the original object and the last copy.
8. Click the Scale button.
FreeHand scales the object, and if you enter a value in the Copies field,
it blends the copies with the original.
If you like really radical transformations, select an object, and then select the
Freeform tool (it’s next to the Scale tool in the Tools panel, and its icon looks
like a backward “S” with a black arrow pointing to a red dot on the line). Move
your cursor toward the object, and then click and drag to modify the shape.
FreeHand morphs the shape like it was made of virtual Silly Putty. You can get
more pronounced results by clicking and dragging a point to warp the shape.
Skewing and distorting objects
In this section, we show you how to skew. Skewing is great fun. And if you
skew up, you can undo the change. If you wanted to make an image of a car
look like it was accelerating or rapidly coming to a halt, you could skew the
image to the left or right.
Skewing an object manually
To skew an object manually, follow these steps:
1. Use the Pointer or Subselection tool to select the object you want to
skew.

Modifying Objects
430
2. Click and hold the Scale tool in the Tools panel and select the Skew
tool from the pop-up menu (refer to Figure 5-1).
You can skew an object vertically or horizontally, relative to a side of
the object, or relative to the center of the object.
3. To skew the object, do one of the following:
• Click above or below the object and drag left or right to skew the
object horizontally, or drag left or right and up or down to skew the
object vertically and horizontally relative to the side from which you
are skewing.
• Click to the right or left of the object and drag up or down to skew
the object vertically, or drag up or down and left or right to skew the
object vertically and horizontally relative to the side from which you
are skewing.
• Click inside the object and drag left or right to skew horizontally, or
drag up or down to skew vertically, or drag up or down and drag left
or right to skew horizontally and vertically relative to the center of
the object.
As you skew the object, FreeHand creates an outline of the shape’s cur-
rent configuration. For best results, hold down the Shift key while you
drag to constrain the skewing to a predefined angle (to predefine the
angle, choose File➪Document Settings➪Constrain and enter a value in
the dialog box; the default angle is 45 degrees).
4. Release the mouse button when the shape has been skewed to 
perfection.
FreeHand skews the shape.
Using the Skew command
If you or your client has a skewed outlook on an illustration, you can easily
get this point across to your viewing audience by skewing one or more
objects with the Skew command. You use the command to precisely 
skew — as opposed to skewer, something the Knife tool is good at — an
object horizontally or vertically. To use the Skew command, follow these
steps:
1. Use the Pointer or Subselection tool to select the object you want to
skew.
2. Choose Modify➪Transform➪Skew or double-click the Skew tool (if
the Skew tool isn’t visible, click and hold the Scale tool in the Tools
panel and select the Skew tool from the pop-up menu).
The Align and Transform panel opens, conveniently bookmarked at the
Skew section of the Transform tab, as shown in Figure 5-3.

3. Enter a value in the H and/or V fields.
These values are in degrees. Enter a positive value in the H field to skew
the object to the right; enter a negative value to skew the object to the
left. Enter a positive value in the V field to skew the object up; enter a
negative value to skew the object down.
4. Select one or both of the following check boxes:
• Contents: Select this check box to skew the contents of a clipping
path along with the rest of the path.
• Fills: Select this check box to skew a tiled fill along with the rest of
the object.
5. In the Center section, enter values in the X and/or Y fields.
If you enter a different value in either of these fields, the object’s center
of rotation changes. FreeHand uses this center when skewing the object.
6. Enter a value in the Copies field.
If you enter a value, FreeHand does not skew the original object and cre-
ates the number of copies specified. The original object is unchanged and
each copy is skewed by the specified amount; the last copy is skewed to a
value that is the product of the number of copies and the skew value you
specify.
7. Click the Skew button.
The object gets skewed.
Rotating objects
No self-respecting graphics program would leave a graphic designer without
a means of rotating an object. FreeHand doesn’t surprise you here. You can
rotate an object or group with the Rotate tool. And if you like to rotate your
objects with a degree of precision (pun intended, a circle after all is 360
degrees), you can use a menu command to do that.
Rotating objects manually
If you prefer menu commands, fast-forward to the “Using the Rotate com-
mand” section. If you prefer freeform rotation, follow these steps:
Figure 5-3:
You can
really skew
up when
you use this
command.

Modifying Objects
432
1. Use the Pointer or Subselection tool to select the object you want to
rotate.
2. Click and hold the Scale tool in the Tools panel and select the
Rotation tool from the pop-up menu (refer to Figure 5-1).
You can use the tool to rotate an object using a corner or the center as
the point of reference.
3. To rotate the object, do one of the following:
• Click any corner and drag to rotate the object relative to the corner
point clicked. If you click beyond the corner boundary of the object,
FreeHand uses the spot you click as the center of rotation.
• Click the center of the object and drag to rotate the object relative to
its center.
As you drag the tool, FreeHand creates an outline of the object’s current
position and a diagonal line to show you the angle of rotation. The
center point of all rotation with the Rotation tool is where the mouse is
clicked on the page. The further you drag the mouse out after clicking
its point of rotation, the higher the degree of accuracy you have.
4. Release the mouse button when you have rotated the object to the
desired position.
FreeHand redraws the object in its new position.
Using the Rotate command
When you need to put a different spin on an object, you can use the Rotate
command. You specify the number of degrees the object rotates, and you
can even spin some copies of the original object. Follow these steps to use
the Rotate command:
1. Use the Pointer or Subselection tool to select the object you want to
rotate.
2. Choose Modify➪Transform➪Rotate or double-click the Rotate tool.
The Align and Transform panel appears with the Rotate section of the
Transform tab selected, as shown in Figure 5-4.
Figure 5-4:

3. Enter a value in the Rotation Angle field.
This is the number of degrees you want the object to rotate. Enter a neg-
ative value to rotate the object in a clockwise direction.
4. Select one of the following check boxes:
• Contents: Select this check box to rotate the contents of a clipping
path with the rest of the path.
• Fills: Select this check box to rotate a tiled fill with the rest of the
object.
5. In the Center section, enter values in the X and/or Y fields.
If you enter a different value in either of these fields, the object’s center of
rotation changes. FreeHand spins an object around the center of rotation.
6. Enter a value in the Copies field.
If you enter a value, the original object is not rotated and FreeHand creates
the number of copies you specify, rotating each copy by the amount speci-
fied. The last copy is rotated to an angle that is determined by the number
of copies and the degree of rotation. For example, if you create three
copies with a rotation of 15 degrees, the last object is rotated 45 degrees.
7. Click the Rotate button.
FreeHand spins the object.
Flipping objects
We’re sure you’ve seen those cute pictures of identical twins standing next
to each other. They look like bookends. If you want the bookend effect in a
FreeHand illustration, you can flip a copy of an object. Or you can flip an
object to point it in the opposite direction. In this section we give you
instructions to flip for.
Reflecting objects manually
You can flip an object with the Reflect tool. When you flip an object, you
create a mirror reflection of the object. If you need to flip an object to keep
your illustration from being a flop, follow these steps:
1. Use the Pointer or Subselection tool to select the object you want to flip.
2. Click and hold the Scale tool in the Tools panel and select the Reflect
tool from the pop-up menu (refer to Figure 5-1).
3. Click the document to specify the centerline FreeHand uses to flip the
object.
If you hold the mouse button, FreeHand creates a vertical line to show
you the centerline and an outline of the shape’s position, which also
allows you to rotate the reflected object (see the next step).

Modifying Objects
434
4. If desired, drag up or down to rotate the reflected object from the
centerline.
As you drag, FreeHand moves the outline to give you a preview of the
reflected object’s current position.
5. Release the mouse button.
FreeHand flips the object and places it on the other side of the spot you
clicked, at a distance equal to the object’s former position from the 
centerline.
Using the Reflect command
You can flip an object vertically or horizontally with the Reflect command.
And if your design calls for it, you can use the command to create a mirror
image alongside of or below the original. To use the Reflect command, do
the following:
1. Use the Pointer or Subselection tool to select the object you want to
reflect.
2. Choose Modify➪Transform➪Reflect or double-click the Reflect tool.
The Align and Transform panel appears, and it’s in a reflective state of
mind, as shown in Figure 5-5.
3. In the Reflect Axis field, enter a value between 0 and 90 to reflect the
object horizontally; enter a value between 90 and 180 to reflect
the object vertically.
4. Select one or both of the following check boxes:
• Contents: Select this check box to reflect the contents of a clipping
path along with the path.
• Fills: Select this check box to reflect a tiled fill with the rest of the
object.
5. Enter a value of 1 in the Copies field.
By default, this field has a value of 0. Entering a value of 1 will create a
mirror image of the original along with the original for a bookend effect.
Figure 5-5:

6. Enter values in the X and Y fields to determine the center axis along
which the object is reflected.
Unless you’re a math whiz, it’s easier to double-click the object and then
drag the center handle (it looks like a gear) to the desired position.
7. Click the Reflect button.
The Align and Transform panel says, “Om,” and the object is reflected.
If you like transforming objects with menu commands, you can save yourself
some time by keeping the Align and Transform panel in your workspace. To
open the Align and Transform panel, choose Window➪Panels➪Transform or
press Ctrl+M. After the panel is open, click the appropriate button to move,
rotate, scale, skew, or reflect a selected object. After you complete the trans-
formation, grab the panel’s handle (the five dots to the left of the panel
name) and drag to the right. A thick black line appears to show where you
can “dock” the panel. Release the mouse button when the black line shows
up where you’d like the panel to sit.
If the Align and Transform panel isn’t docked, you can also open it by
double-clicking any of the transformation tools (the ones grouped with the
Scale tool in the Tools panel).
Using the Move command
You can move objects anywhere in your document with the Pointer tool.
However, when precision is needed, only a good menu command will do; in
this case the Move command. If you need any object in your document to
get a move on with precision, follow these steps:
1. Use the Pointer or Subselection tool to select the object you want to
move.
2. Choose Modify➪Transform➪Move.
The Align and Transform panel appears with the Move section selected,
as shown in Figure 5-6.
Figure 5-6:

Modifying Objects
436
3. Enter a value in the X field and/or Y field.
This is the distance in pixels (or the unit of measure you specify for the
document) you want the object to move along each axis.
4. Select one or both of the following check boxes:
• Contents: Select this check box to move the contents of a clipping
path with the rest of the path.
• Fills: Select this check box to move a tiled fill with the rest of the
object.
5. Enter a value in the Copies field.
If you enter a value in this field, FreeHand does not move the original
object and creates copies equally spaced along a path between the orig-
inal object’s position and the position that results by applying the
values entered in each field.
6. Click the Move button.
FreeHand moves the object and makes the number of copies you specify.
You can also nudge a selected object by pressing one of the arrow keys on
your keyboard. Hold down the Shift key while moving the object to increase
the nudge distance by a factor of ten. To customize the nudge distance, choose
File➪Document➪Settings➪Cursor Distance. The Cursor Distance dialog box
appears. Enter a value in the Shift+Arrow Key text field and click OK.
Giving an object some perspective
The Perspective tool allows you to take an object — such as a circle, rectan-
gle, polygon, or text — and align it to a perspective grid to make the object
look like it has dimension. Now, you may be wondering how that’s any differ-
ent than the Skew tool. The Skew tool creates a rhombus outline, making a
parallelogram out of the object: the top and bottom edges will be parallel to
each other, and the sides will be parallel to each other. In contrast, the
Perspective tool makes all sides vanish to a set of vanishing points. The top
and bottom converge (or diverge if you’re looking at it that way), and the
sides are either constrained vertically, or converge upwards (or downwards,
depending on what you’re doing). 
To give an object perspective, just follow these steps: 
1. Create an object on the canvas, or select an already created object.
As noted previously, the object can be a polygon, circle, rectangle, text,
or an open or closed path. 
2. Show the Perspective grid by choosing View➪Perspective Grid➪Show.

Book IV
Chapter 5
Transforming Text,
Shapes, and Images
Modifying Objects
437
This brings up the default Perspective grid for the page, as shown in
Figure 5-7. You can modify the Perspective grid by selecting View➪
Perspective Grid➪Define and changing the number of vanishing points
(that’s what creates the distance depth), the size of the grid squares, and
the colors used for the grid. 
3. Select the Perspective tool from the Tools panel (the Perspective tool
looks like a blue parallelogram with a light green fill and some light
blue parallel lines in front) and click the object you want to give 
perspective. 
4. Move the object to where you’d like it on the grid, and while keeping
the mouse button held down, use the arrow keys to place the object
in the proper perspective grid.
When you use the arrow keys, a wireframe of your object appears and
moves from grid cell to grid cell as you press the arrow keys. This takes
a little getting used to, and depending upon which arrow key you press,
the object may move around a lot on the grid. But after you play with it
for a bit, you’ll get the hang of it. 
5. Release the mouse button to create the perspective for your object.
FreeHand puts the object in perspective.
Figure 5-7:
Now that’s
some

Extruding an object
If you have designs on becoming a 3D graphical artist, then there’s no better
place to get started than FreeHand. In addition to being able to create 2D
objects and giving them depth perception, now you can actually take a 2D
object and turn it into a 3D object by using the Extrude tool.
To use the Extrude tool to transform a 2D object into a 3D object, just follow
these steps:
1. Select the Extrude tool from the Tools panel — the tool that looks like
a 3D elongated cube, found to the right of the Perspective tool. 
2. Click and drag the tool on the object to apply the extrusion effect.
3. Release the mouse button to apply the effect. 
While the Perspective and Extrude tools are cool to watch in action, they
generally require more processing power than the other, basic tools. If you’re
using FreeHand on an older machine, you could find yourself waiting around,
staring at your screen as you turn that 2D polygon into a 3D polygon. 
Scaling, skewing, and rotating with the Pointer tool
When you first glance at the Pointer tool, you might think all it can do is
select objects. But this tool has the strength of three tools — the Rotate
tool, the Scale tool, and the Skew tool — when you use it in combination
with Transformation Handles (the boxes that appear along the perimeter of
an object when you select it). You can use the tool to scale, skew, and rotate
in a constrained or freeform manner. To transform an object with the
Pointer tool, follow these steps:
1. Select the Pointer tool from the Tools panel.
2. Double-click the object you want to transform.
When you double-click the object, a bounding box with eight
Transformation Handles along the perimeter appears. A circular
handle in the center that looks like a gear also appears, as shown
in Figure 5-8.
3. After double-clicking the object, you can do any of the following to
transform the object’s shape:
• To change the object’s height: Move your cursor toward the handle
on the center top or bottom of the object. When your cursor
becomes a two-headed vertical arrow, click and drag up or down.

Book IV
Chapter 5
Transforming Text,
Shapes, and Images
Modifying Objects
439
• To change the object’s width: Move your cursor toward the handle
on the middle right or left of the object. When your cursor becomes
a two-headed horizontal arrow, click and then drag right or left.
• To scale the object: Move your cursor toward any corner point.
When your cursor becomes a dual-headed diagonal arrow, click and
drag toward the object or away from it. Hold down the Shift key
while dragging to scale the object proportionately.
When scaling an object proportionately with the Pointer tool, be
sure to release the mouse button before releasing the Shift key; 
otherwise the object may not scale proportionately.
• To move the object’s center of rotation: Click the handle that looks
like a gear and drag it to a different location. You can drag the
handle anywhere in the document.
• To rotate an object: Move your cursor beyond the object’s bounding
box. When your cursor becomes a curved two-headed arrow, click
and drag to rotate the object. FreeHand rotates the object relative to
its center of rotation, the little gear-like handle that you can move
anywhere to change the center of rotation.
• To skew the object horizontally: Move your cursor between the
center and one of the corner points on the object’s top or bottom.
When your cursor becomes two horizontal lines with arrows going
in opposite directions, click and drag left or right. If you move your
cursor diagonally, the object will rotate and skew at the same time.
• To skew the object vertically: Move your cursor between the center
and one of the corner points on the left or right side of the object.
When your cursor becomes two vertical lines with arrows going in
opposite directions, move your cursor up or down. If you move your
cursor diagonally, the object rotates around its center point and
skews at the same time. You can hold down the Shift key while you
drag to prevent the object from rotating while it skews.

4. Release the mouse button when the object is transformed to the
desired shape.
The object is transformed.
5. You can now drag other handles to further change the object, or
double-click anywhere beyond the object’s bounding box.
If you press the Tab key or double-click beyond the bounding box, the
super Pointer tool swoops into a phone booth and resumes its former
guise as the mild-mannered Pointer tool. The object is still selected.
Using the Trace Tool
You use the Trace tool to trace all or part of a bitmap image or any other
FreeHand object. When you use the Trace tool, you transform the pixels in
the bitmap into vector paths and shapes. The default settings for the Trace
tool are optimized to produce good results without taxing your system.
However, you can modify the settings if your computer has a powerful
processor and lots of memory. Follow these steps to use the Trace tool:
1. Double-click the Trace tool. (It’s just below the Perspective tool
in the Tools panel and resembles the Magic Wand tool you find in
Fireworks MX.)
The Trace Tool dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 5-9.

2. From the first Color Mode drop-down list, select an option.
You can use as few as 2 colors to trace a bitmap, or as many as 256.
Choosing a higher value creates more vector objects, and your com-
puter takes longer to perform the operation.
3. Select Colors or Grays from the next Color Mode drop-down list.
If you select Grays, the traced image will be grayscale.
4. If you’re tracing a color image, select the RGB color model or CMYK
color model from the third Color Mode drop-down list.
Select the RGB color model if your illustration will be displayed on a
monitor; select CMYK if your illustration will be printed.
5. From the Resolution drop-down list, select High, Normal, or Low.
Selecting Medium or High results in a more faithful rendition of the origi-
nal bitmap; however, this produces more vector objects and takes
longer for your computer and printer to process.
6. Select one of the following options from the Trace Layers drop-down
list:
• All: FreeHand traces all layers.
• Foreground: FreeHand traces only the foreground layer.
• Background: FreeHand traces only the background layer.
7. From the Path Conversion drop-down list, select one of the following
options:
• Outline: Select this option, and FreeHand traces the outline of blocks
of color in the bitmap and creates closed, filled paths. If you select
this option, the Path Overlap field opens. Select None for tracing text
objects and line art, select the Loose option to trace an image made
up of large areas of single colors, or select the Tight option for best
results when tracing images like JPEGs with millions of colors.
• Centerline: Select this option, and FreeHand traces the center of
strokes. Use this option when you are tracing a vector illustration
with lots of line work and few fills. If you select this option, the
Uniform Lines option is selected by default. Deselect the Uniform
Lines option to create paths with varying stroke widths.
• Centerline/Outline: Select this option to trace an object with the
end result being vector objects with both strokes and fills.
Contiguous areas of color will be outlined with a stroke. If you select
this option, enter an Open Path Below value between 2 and 10 pixels.
When tracing, FreeHand leaves any paths below this value open.

8. Drag the slider to specify a value for Trace Conformity.
You can specify a value between 0 and 10. Select a low value for a loose
rendering of the original bitmap; a higher value for a more precise ren-
dering of the image with more points.
9. Drag the slider to specify a value for Noise Tolerance.
This setting determines how FreeHand deals with muddy areas of color,
scan lines, or other noise in a low-quality image. You can specify a value
between 0 and 10. Choose a higher value to remove more noise from the
original.
10. Drag the slider to set a value for Wand Color Tolerance.
This value determines how FreeHand treats neighboring areas of color.
If you choose a low value, FreeHand blends colors of similar hues; if you
choose a high value, FreeHand creates more colors when tracing.
11. Click OK.
The Trace Tool dialog box closes.
12. Click one corner of the area you want to trace and drag the tool to
define the area you want traced.
As you drag the tool, FreeHand creates a dotted marquee showing you
the current selection area. Hold down the Shift key to constrain the
selection to a square area.
13. Release the mouse button when you have selected the desired area.
FreeHand traces the object.
Creating New Shapes by Combining Shapes
Did you ever wish you could combine a rectangle with a triangle and an oval
to create a freeform sculpture? With FreeHand, you can combine shapes to
create something new by choosing a menu command. To combine two or
more shapes into a new shape, follow these steps:
1. Use the Pointer tool to select the shapes you want to combine.
Hold down the Shift key and click to select multiple shapes. You can
select as many shapes as you need. The shapes must overlap, unless
you’re using the Blend command.
2. Choose Modify➪Combine and choose one of the following commands
from the submenu:
• Blend: Creates a blend between the selected shapes. When you choose
this command, FreeHand creates new shapes between the original
shapes. By default, FreeHand places 25 steps in the blend, but you can
change the number of steps in the Object tab of the Properties panel.

• Union: Joins the selected objects into a single object. If you choose
this command with filled objects, the new object inherits the fill of
the object that was highest in the stack.
• Divide: Creates new shapes where the shapes intersect.
• Intersect: Creates a new shape that encompasses the area where the
original shapes overlap.
• Punch: Cuts the object highest in the stack out of the objects 
underneath.
• Crop: Creates new paths by cropping to the area where the paths
overlap.
After you choose one of the Combine commands, FreeHand creates new
shapes. Figure 5-10 shows the different shapes you can create with the 
commands.
Using the Xtra Tools to Change a Shape
You use the Xtra tools to create interesting shapes and modify existing ones.
Instead of using a whole lot of pages to write about each tool, in the next
sections, we show you how to use some of the more popular Xtra tools. We
leave it to you to explore the others at your own leisure. To use an Xtra tool,
choose Window➪Toolbars➪Xtra Tools, and the toolbar shown in Figure 5-11
appears.

Using the Arc tool
You use the Arc Xtra tool to create . . . you guessed it: Arcs. To use the Arc
tool, follow these steps:
1. Double-click the Arc tool on the Xtra toolbar, as shown in Figure 5-11.
The Arc Tool dialog box opens.
2. Select one of the following options: Create Open Arc, Create Flipped
Arc, or Create Concave Arc.
When you select an option, a window in the dialog box gives you a pre-
view of the arc the option creates.
3. Click and drag on the canvas.
As you drag the tool, a preview of the shape is created.
4. When the arc is the desired shape, release the mouse button.
Using the 3D Rotation tool
You use the 3D Rotation tool to give a garden-variety shape, such as a rec-
tangle, the illusion of perspective. The tool is interactive; you click and drag
until you get the result you want. Follow these steps to use the 3D Rotation
tool:
1. Use the Pointer tool to select the shape to which you want to add 
perspective.
2. Select the 3D Rotation tool from the Xtra Tools toolbar (see Fig-
ure 5-11).
3. Click and drag.
As you drag, FreeHand draws a preview of the shape.

FreeHand completes the 3D rotation.
You can modify the settings for the 3D Rotation tool by double-clicking it
and modifying the settings in the 3D Rotation dialog box.
Using the Smudge tool
You use the Smudge tool to create ghost images of an object. It almost looks
like someone repeatedly mashed a rubber stamp while moving along a
straight line; each image is more faded than the last until the effect fades
away. To use the Smudge tool, follow these steps:
1. Use the Pointer tool to select the object you want to smudge.
2. Select the Smudge tool from the Xtra Tools toolbar, as shown in
Figure 5-11.
Your cursor becomes a pointing finger.
Double-click the Smudge tool to open the Smudge Tool dialog box.
Within this dialog box, you can specify the final stroke and fill colors by
dragging a color swatch from the Swatches, Tint, or Color Mixer panels
into the appropriate field in the Smudge Tool dialog box.
3. Click and drag in the direction you want the smudges to appear.
As you drag, an outline of the shape signifies the current position of
your cursor and a straight line is drawn from the object’s original posi-
tion to the current position of the cursor. The straight line indicates the
path of the smudges.
4. Release the mouse button when the smudge path is acceptable.
FreeHand creates some smudges.
Using the Shadow tool
You use the Shadow tool to create a drop shadow for a vector object in your
document. You use the tool interactively by simply clicking where you want
the shadow to appear. To create a shadow, follow these steps:
1. Use the Pointer tool to select the object you want to give a shadow.
2. Select the Shadow tool from the Xtra Tools toolbar (see Figure 5-11).
3. Click and drag.
As you drag, FreeHand creates an outline of the shadow’s current posi-
tion and a straight line from the corner of the original object to the
shadow.

4. Release the mouse button when the shadow is in the desired position.
FreeHand creates a shadow using a tint of the original fill.
You can vary the opacity of the shadow and change several other param-
eters by double-clicking the Shadow tool and specifying different 
parameters in the Shadow dialog box.
You’ll find two other useful tools are on the Xtra Tools toolbar: the Bend
tool and the Graphics Hose tool. The Bend tool bends vector objects. If you
need to add many identical graphic elements, such as flowers or leaves, to
an illustration, the Graphics Hose tool is the tool you need. Double-click the
Graphics Hose tool to fill the graphic hose with preset objects from the
Contents list, set your parameters, and then click away.
Using Xtra Operations to Modify Shapes
You use the Xtra Operations toolbar to modify shapes and more without a
lot of extra work. Many of the tools on this toolbar are duplicated as menu
commands. To open the Xtra Operations toolbar, shown in Figure 5-12,
choose Window➪Toolbars➪Xtra Operations.
Most of the tools shown in Figure 5-12 have been covered previously. We
urge you to experiment with the others, but unfortunately, we have no more
space left to cover them. We’re going to squeeze in an introduction to one
more tool, though: the Emboss tool.

The Emboss Xtra Operations tool is cool for things like buttons and just
plain old fancy objects. The Emboss tool has so many options, it would
take a half-hour long infomercial — The Amazing Emboss-O-Matic — to
explain them all. We give you the condensed version of how to use the
Emboss tool:
1. Use the Pointer tool to select the object you want to emboss.
2. Double-click the Emboss tool from the Xtra Operations toolbar, as
shown in Figure 5-12.
The Emboss dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 5-13.
3. Click a button to select an emboss style. The available styles are:
Emboss, Deboss, Chisel, Ridge, or Quilt.
The buttons look just like the effect you get when you apply the effect to
an object.
4. From the Vary drop-down list, select Color or Contrast.
If you select Contrast, use the slider to set the contrast level (drag the
slider to the left to decrease contrast and to the right to increase con-
trast). If you select the Color option, the Highlight and Shadow fields
become available. Click each color swatch to choose a color from the
color picker.
5. Drag the slider to choose a Depth setting.
6. Enter a value in the Angle field.
This determines the angle from which the light source comes. Alterna-
tively, you can click and drag the dial slider.

hen you create a FreeHand MX illustration, you can work with as
much or as little color as you want. You can use color sparingly if
you’re creating an illustration for the Web, or you can use lots of color if
you’re creating illustrations for print. FreeHand gives you a wide variety of
color tools to work with. You can mix colors, create color palettes, load
color palettes, and more. If you like bright, vibrant objects that look three
dimensional in your illustrations, you can use the Fill options in the Objects
tab of the Properties panel to create a gradient fill (a gradual transition
between two or more colors).
In this chapter, we show you how to use the FreeHand color tools to add
vibrancy to every illustration you create. We explain how to work with the
different color models to mix up colors, as well as how to use the Swatches
tab of the Assets panel to create a color palette for your document. If you
prefer to stick with a given color, but want lighter variations of it, we detail
how to do this with the Tints tab of the Mixer and Tints panel.
Before you begin creating an illustration, consider its final destination. Are
you creating an illustration for print or for the Web? If you’re creating an
illustration for print, choose colors from the CMYK palette. If you are having
a service center print the illustration, find out what system they use for
color matching and choose all your colors from that color system. We show
you how to choose from a color system in the section, “Using the Swatches
Tab of the Assets Panel.”
If you’re creating an illustration for viewing on a computer, use colors from
the RGB color model. If you’re creating a document for Web viewing, remem-
ber the old Zen maxim: Less is more. If your viewing audience accesses the
Internet using dial-up modems, the fewer colors you use, the smaller the file
size, and thus the quicker the download time.

Using the Mixer Tab
450
Using the Mixer Tab
You use the Mixer tab of the Mixer and Tints panel to mix up any color of the
rainbow for your objects. You can mix a color using one of three color
models, or you can use the System Color Picker to add a splash of color to
your illustration (Mac users can select colors from Crayons, a Spectrum, and
more). The neat thing about the Mixer tab is that you’re dealing with values.
If you have a set of values for a color (say that lovely chartreuse your client
uses for a logo), you can match that color exactly by entering the values in
the appropriate section of the Mixer tab. In the next few sections, we explain
how to use each color model to mix up a shade of chartreuse, or whatever
other color you fancy for your illustration. To open the Mixer tab, shown in
Figure 6-1, choose Window➪Color Mixer or press Shift+F9.
After mixing a color, you can apply it to an object or add it to the Swatches
tab of the Assets panel. We cover these colorful tasks in the upcoming sec-
tion, “Working with the Mixer Tab.”
Mixing a CMYK color
When you mix a color using the CMYK color model, you mix percentages of
Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and blacK. If your document is destined for print,
this is the color model you should choose. Follow these steps to mix a color
using the CMYK color model:
1. Choose Window➪Color Mixer or press Shift+F9.
The Mixer and Tints panel, previously shown in Figure 6-1, opens.

2. Click the CMYK button, which is the top button.
The Mixer tab goes into CMYK mode.
3. Drag the sliders to mix the color.
As you drag the sliders, the color swatch on the right side at the bottom
of the panel changes to reflect the current values, as shown in Figure
6-2. The values in each field update as well. Alternatively, you can enter
known values in each field to match a known color, or click the arrows
to increment the values.
Mixing an RGB color
When you create illustrations that will be displayed on a Web site or as part
of a CD-ROM presentation, you use the RGB (Red, Green, Blue) color model.
You have 256 values (values from 0 to 255) of each color to work with. For
example, if you create an RGB color with the following values (R=255, G=0,
B=0), you get bright red; the following values yield bright blue (R=0, G=0,
B=255), the values for black are (R=0, G=0, B=0), and so on. When you com-
bine the possible permutations, you end up with millions of colors. To mix
an RGB color, follow these steps:
1. Choose Window➪Color Mixer or press Shift+F9.
The Mixer and Tints panel opens to show the Mixer tab (refer to
Figure 6-1).
2. Click the RGB button, which is the second one from the top in the
panel.
The Mixer tab is reconfigured, as shown in Figure 6-3.

3. Drag the sliders to mix the color.
As you drag the sliders, the color swatch on the right side at the bottom
of the panel changes to reflect the current values. The values in each
field also update. Alternatively, you can enter values in the text fields,
which by the by, is the proper way to match a known color value.
Mixing an HLS color
FreeHand uses HLS (Hue, Lightness, Saturation) color; you may see this
color model referred to as HSB (Hue, Saturation, Brightness) in other pro-
grams. When you mix a color using the HLS color model, you choose a hue,
specify the lightness of the color, and how saturated the color is. The HLS
model is actually a color wheel. The hue is a value between 0 and 360
degrees. Values for light and saturation vary between 0 and 100. To mix an
HLS color, follow these steps:
1. Choose Window➪Color Mixer or press Shift+F9.
The Mixer and Tints panel opens with the Mixer tab selected (refer to
Figure 6-1).
2. Click the HLS button, which is the third one from the top in the panel.
The Mixer tab is reconfigured, as shown in Figure 6-4.
3. Click inside the color wheel and drag to select a hue.
As you drag, the color swatch at the bottom of the panel changes to
reflect the color your cursor is currently over. The values in the Hue and
Saturation fields update as well.

4. Drag the slider to select a value for Lightness.
The values vary from 0 (black) to 100 (white). Alternatively, you can
enter a value in the Lightness field.
5. To specify saturation, enter a value in the Saturation field.
You can enter a value between 0 and 100. Low values create a grayer
variation of the color; higher values increase saturation, creating a more
vibrant color. Alternatively, you can drag the point in the color wheel,
towards the center to decrease saturation, or away from the center to
increase saturation.
After you mix up a color, click the button for another color mode to see the
component values for the new color in that color mode.
Mixing a color from the System Color Picker
Your operating system uses specific colors to display the icons, buttons,
and text of the software you use. You can use a color from the System Color
Picker in your FreeHand illustrations (Mac users can choose a color from
Crayons, a Spectrum, Grayscale, CMYK, RGB, HSB, Web-safe colors, and
more). To mix a color from the System Color Picker, follow these steps:
1. Choose Window➪Color Mixer or press Shift+F9.
The Mixer and Tints panel opens to show the Mixer tab (refer to
Figure 6-1).
2. Click the System Color Picker button, which is the fourth one from
the top in the panel.
The Color dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 6-5.

Half of the bar at the bottom of the Mixer tab of the Mixer and Tints
panel refreshes to show the color you select. The component values for
the color are displayed in the text fields for the color mode you choose.
If you want to see the values for the color in CMYK, RGB, or HLS, click
the appropriate button on the Mixer tab.
Working with the Mixer Tab
After you use the Mixer tab to mix the perfect hue, you can apply it directly
to an object, use it for the current fill color, or add it to the Swatches tab of
the Assets panel. We show you how to use the Swatches tab of the Assets
panel to create a color palette in the upcoming section, “Using the Swatches
Tab of the Assets Panel.”
Using the Mixer tab to apply color to an object
When you mix a color with the Mixer tab, you can apply it directly to the
stroke or fill of an object in your document. To apply a color from the Mixer
tab to an object, follow these steps:
1. Click the swatch shown in the right half of the rectangular bar at the
bottom of the Mixer tab.
A square appears at the end of your cursor.
2. While holding down the mouse button, drag toward the object you
want to apply the color to.
3. Release the mouse button when your cursor is over the stroke or fill
of the object, whichever you want to change.
The color is applied to stroke or fill of the object.

Using the Mixer tab to change 
the current fill or stroke color
If you’re getting ready to create several objects and you want to use the same
stroke or fill color on these objects, you can replace the current stroke or fill
color with one you mix in the Mixer tab and create away. To use a color
mixed in the Mixer tab as the current fill or stroke color, follow these steps:
1. Click the swatch shown in the right half of the rectangular bar at the
bottom of the Mixer tab.
A square appears at the end of your cursor.
2. While holding down the mouse button, drag towards the Fill or
Stroke color box.
You can find these boxes in the Colors section of the Tools panel.
3. Release the mouse button when your cursor is over the Fill or Stroke
color box.
The swatch in the Fill color box or Stroke color box changes to the color
you mixed in the Mixer tab. If you have an object in the document
selected, its fill or stroke color changes as well.
Adding a color to the Swatches
tab of the Assets panel
If you mix a color you’re going to use repeatedly in the document, you can
add it to the Swatches tab. To add a color from the Mixer tab to the
Swatches tab of the Assets panel, follow these steps:
1. Choose Window➪Color Mixer or press Shift+F9.
The Mixer and Tints panel opens.
2. Mix a color.
If you don’t know how to mix a color, read the preceding section, “Using
the Mixer Tab.”
3. Click the Add to Swatches button at the lower-left corner of the Mixer
tab — it’s the one to the right of the Change Attribute Color button.
The Add to Swatches dialog box opens.
4. Accept the default name for the color or enter one of your own.
FreeHand uses the component values to name the color. When the color
is added to the Swatches tab of the Assets panel, a small rectangular
swatch of the new color is added as well. If you give the color a unique
name, it will be easier to find if you’re creating an illustration with lots of
colors. To give the color a unique name, type the name and press Enter.

Creating Color Tints

5. Choose Process or Spot.
This option refers to how the color is separated for the output device.
Process colors are printed on four separate pages using the four
process (CMYK) inks. Spot colors are not separated and are printed
on a separate plate.
6. Click Add.
The color is added to the Swatches tab of the Assets panel.
Creating Color Tints
When you create a color tint, you create a lighter variation of the original
color. You create a color tint by varying the percentage of the original color
with the Tints tab of the Mixers and Tints panel. After you create a color
tint, you can apply it directly to an object, add the tint to the Swatches tab
of the Assets panel, or use it as the current fill or stroke color. To create a
color tint, follow these steps:
1. Create a color using the Mixer tab of the Mixer and Tints panel.
2. Click the Tints tab on the panel.
The Tints tab opens, as shown in Figure 6-6.
3. Drag the slider to specify the percentage of the original color that will
be used to create the tint.

bottom-left of the panel, which is the original color. Alternatively, you
can tint the color by clicking one of the squares (tints of the original
color in ten percent increments) or by entering a value in the field.
4. After creating the tint, do one of the following:
• Click the color swatch shown in the right half of the rectangle at the
bottom of the panel, and then drag and drop the color on an object
in the document.
• Click the color swatch shown in the right half of the rectangle at the
bottom of the panel, and then drag and drop the color on the Fill
color box to replace the current fill color with the tint, or drag and
drop the color on the Stroke color box to replace the current stroke
color with the tint. If you have an object selected while doing this,
the object’s stroke or fill color is changed as well. Note: The Fill color
box and the Stroke color box are both found on the Tools panel.
• Click the Add to Swatches button to add the tint to the Swatches tab
of the Assets panel. After you click the button, the Add to Swatches
dialog box appears. For more information, read the “Adding a color to
the Swatches tab of the Assets panel” section, earlier in this chapter.
If the Mixer and Tint panel is open at the same time as the Swatches tab of
the Assets panels, you can click the color swatch at the bottom of either the
Mixer tab or the Tint tab in the Mixer and Tint panel, and drag and drop it
into the Swatches tab, and the color is added to the palette.
Using the Swatches Tab of the Assets Panel
When you create an illustration that uses the same colors on each page or
for several objects, mixing the color each time you need it is time-consuming
and counterproductive. You can save a considerable amount of time if you
add the colors you use frequently to the Swatches tab of the Assets panel.
You also use the Swatches tab to organize and apply colors from standard
preset color-matching systems. This option is handy if you’re creating a 
document that will be printed by a service center. If you’re creating a docu-
ment for a Web page, you can also choose a color from the Web safe color
library. Another option you have with the Swatches tab is saving the current
color palette for future use. To open the Swatches tab, shown in Figure 6-7,
choose Window➪Swatches or press Ctrl+F9.
The Swatches tab shown in Figure 6-7 already has colors added to it. The
default colors when you create a new document are None, Black, White, and
Registration. You cannot rename or delete these colors. Black is a spot color
that is used for the black separation plate when printing a process color.
The registration color, a combination of CMY and K, all at 100%, is used for
crop or trim marks and prints solid on separations.

Using the Swatches Tab of the Assets Panel
458
You can differentiate color types in the Swatches tab of the Assets panel as
follows:
✦Process colors: The names of process colors are italicized.
✦Spot colors: The names of spot colors are displayed with plain type.
✦RGB colors: RGB colors display a triangular icon with red, green, and
blue spheres after the color’s name. Colors derived from the HLS color
wheel or the System Color Picker are displayed as RGB colors as well.
✦CMYK colors: CMYK colors are displayed with no icon.
After you open the Swatches tab of the Assets panel, you can do any of the
following:
✦Apply a color to an object: You can apply a color to the stroke or fill of
an object by selecting the color and dragging and dropping it on an
object. Alternatively, you can apply a color by selecting an object, click-
ing the Fill, Stroke, or Stroke and Fill button at the top of the Swatches
tab, and clicking the desired color’s name in the Swatches tab.
✦Modify a color: You can modify a color in one of two ways:
• Mixer tab: You can modify a color in the Swatches tab by opening
the Mixer tab and dragging and dropping a color from the Swatches
tab to the left side of the rectangular color swatch at the bottom of
the Mixer tab.
• Tints tab: You can modify a color in the Swatches tab by opening the
Tints tab and dragging and dropping a color from the Swatches tab
to the left side of the rectangular color swatch at the bottom of the
Tints tab.
✦Change the stroke color: You can change the current stroke color by
selecting a color from the Swatches tab and then dragging and dropping
it on the Stroke color box on the Tools panel.
✦Change the fill color: You can change the current fill color by selecting
a color from the Swatches tab and then dragging and dropping it on the
Fill color box on the Tools panel.

Adding preset colors to the Swatches tab
You can add a color to the Swatches tab of the Assets panel from either
the Mixer tab or the Tints tab, as outlined earlier in the chapter. If you fast-
forwarded to this section and need to know how to add a color to the
Swatches tab from the Mixer tab, read the section, “Adding a color to the
Swatches tab”; to add a tint to the Swatches tab, read the section, “Creating
Color Tints.” In this section, we show you how to add colors to the
Swatches tab from preset color matching systems. To add a color from a
preset color matching system to the Swatches tab, follow these steps:
1. Choose Window➪Swatches.
The Swatches tab of the Assets panel opens.
2. Click the Options menu (the bulleted list icon at the upper-right corner
of the Assets panel) and choose one of the preset color matching sets.
If the document you’re creating will be printed commercially, find out the
system they use for color matching. For example, they may use one of
the PANTONE or Munsell matching systems. If the document you’re cre-
ating will be displayed on a Web page, choose Web Safe Color Library.
When you choose a color matching system, a dialog box appears.
3. Select a color (or colors) from the Library dialog box.
You can select additional contiguous colors by clicking them while hold-
ing down the Shift key and non-contiguous colors by holding down the
Ctrl key.
4. Click OK.
The Library dialog box closes and FreeHand adds the selected color(s)
to the Swatches tab using the color’s default library name.
You can also double-click a color to add it the Swatches tab, which will close

You can rename any color in the Swatches tab, except the default colors:
None, Black, White, and Registration. If you give a color a unique name,
you’ll have an easier time selecting it from the Swatches tab. To rename a
color, follow these steps:
1. Choose Window➪Swatches.
The Swatches tab of the Assets panel opens.
2. Double-click the color you want to rename.
The color’s name is highlighted.

3. Type a new name for the color and then press Enter.
The color is renamed.
Exporting a color palette
When you create an ideal color palette, you can export the palette for use in
documents you create in the future. This option is handy if you do work for
a client that uses specific color combinations for their text and logo. You
create the palette by adding colors to the Swatches tab as outlined previ-
ously in this chapter in the “Adding a color to the Swatches tab,” “Creating
Color Tints,” and “Adding preset colors to the Swatches tab” sections. After
you create the palette (also known as a Color Library), you can export it by
following these steps:
1. Choose Window➪Swatches or press Ctrl+F9.
The Swatches tab of the Assets panel opens.
2. Click the Options menu (the bulleted list icon at the upper-right
corner of the Assets panel) and choose Export.
The Export Colors dialog box, shown in Figure 6-8, opens.
3. Select the colors you want to export.
To select a color, click it. Hold down the Shift key to add a selection of
contiguous colors to the selection, or hold down the Ctrl key to add
individual noncontiguous colors to the selection.
4. Click OK.
The Create Color Library dialog box appears.

5. Enter a name in the Library Name field.
Choose a meaningful name that describes the type of colors in the
library, or enter the name of the client you use the colors for.
6. In the Filename field, accept the default name of CUSTOM, or enter
another name for the library.
If you intend to store more than one library, change the name to one
that reflects the contents of the library. When you import the Color
Library into a future document, this is the name you look for.
7. Click Save.
FreeHand saves the library in the Colors folder (in FreeHand’s Settings
folder) and the colors in it appear on the Swatches tab.
Adding custom colors to the Swatches tab
After you save a color palette as a library, you can use any or all colors from
the palette in new illustrations by adding them to the Swatches tab of the
Assets panel. To add colors from a custom library to the current Swatches
tab, follow these steps:
1. Choose Windows➪Swatches or press Ctrl+F9.
The Swatches panel opens.
2. Click the Options menu (the bulleted list icon at the upper-right
corner of the Assets panel) and select the custom color library by
clicking its name.
The Library dialog box opens.
3. Select the colors you want to add to the Swatches tab.
Select an individual color by clicking its swatch. To add contiguous
colors to the selection, hold down the Shift key and click the top and
bottom colors you want to add. To add noncontiguous colors to the
selection, hold down the Ctrl key and click the individual colors you
want to add.
4. Click OK.
The colors are added to the Swatches tab.
You can also copy and paste or drag and drop named colors from one open
FreeHand document to another. The colors will be added to the Swatches
tab automatically.

Using the Eyedropper Tool
462
Using the Eyedropper Tool
You use the Eyedropper tool to sample a color. You can sample the color
from an object in your document, the Stroke color box, the Fill color box, or
from the following panel tabs: Mixer, Tints, and Swatches. To sample a color
with the Eyedropper tool, follow these steps:
1. Select the Eyedropper tool from the Tools panel.
It’s the tool with an eyedropper for an icon.
2. Sample a color by doing one of the following:
• Click an object in the document window.
• Click a color swatch in any of the following panel tabs: Mixer,
Swatches, or Tints.
After you sample a color, hold down the mouse button and drag and
drop the color to any of the following:
• A different object in the document: Do this when you sample a
color from one object that you want to apply to another.
• An object in the document: Do this when you want to sample a
color from a panel tab.
• The color swatch in the Mixer tab: Do this when you want to modify
a color using the Mixer tab.
• The color swatch in the Tints tab: Do this when you want to tint an
existing color.
• The Swatches tab: Do this when you want to add a sampled color to
the Swatches tab.
3. Release the mouse button.
The sampled color is applied to the object or added to the tab you
dropped it on.
Modifying Strokes
You use the Object tab of the Properties panel to change the color of a
stroke, its width, and other parameters. If the stroke is a single line, you can
add arrowheads to the head and/or tail of the stroke. The Object tab of the
Properties panel has enough options to fill up a whole lot of pages. You’ll
never use many of the options, so we spare you a lot of excess verbiage by
showing you how to modify a basic stroke in this section. To modify a stroke
using the Object tab of the Properties panel, follow these steps:

7. Click a button in the Join section to determine how path ends join.
The available options are Mitered, Round, and Bevel.
8. Enter a value in the Miter field.
This value is applicable if you choose a miter join. Enter a value
between 1 and 57. If the line length exceeds this value, it will be squared
off instead of mitered.
9. To have a dashed stroke, select an option from the Dash drop-down list.
10. To apply an arrowhead to an open path, select an option from each of
the Arrowheads drop-down lists.
Use the left Arrowheads drop-down list to select an arrowhead for the
start of the path; use the right Arrowheads drop-down list to select an
arrowhead for the end of the path. You can select different arrowheads
for each end of the path. You can also have an arrowhead at one end of
the path and no arrowhead at the other.
The settings you specify are applied to the selected stroke. When you
create a new stroke, the stroke is created using the previous settings.
You can use the Object tab to set stroke settings for all future strokes you
create. Deselect all objects in the document, select a non-drawing tool, such
as the Pointer tool, and then set stroke characteristics as outlined in the
previous steps. The characteristics will be applied to all future strokes until
you modify the settings in the Object tab.
If you like artistic brush strokes, select a path, open the Object tab, and then
select Brush from the Stroke Type drop-down list. (Refer to Figure 6-9.) You
can make the stroke look like it was painted with an artist’s brush or an 
airbrush.
Modifying Fills
When you add color to a shape, you give it a fill. You can modify the fill at
any time using the Object tab of the Properties panel. The Object tab is
filled with all manner of different fill options. In fact, it has so many options;
it would fill a chapter of its own. In the upcoming sections, we show you the
most commonly used fill options.
Creating a basic fill
You can create or modify a basic fill through the Object tab in the Properties
panel. A basic fill is pretty simple; it only has one color. When your design
calls for a basic fill, here’s how you create one with the Object tab:

Book IV
Chapter 6
Exploring the Color
Management Tools
Modifying Fills
465
1. Use the Pointer tool to select the object whose fill you want to modify.
Alternatively, deselect all objects in the document, select a non-drawing
tool, and the fill you create is applied to all future shapes you create.
2. Choose Window➪Object or press Ctrl+F3.
The Object tab of the Properties panel opens.
3. Click Fill: Basic beneath the object box in the list area of the panel.
By default, fills are defined as Basic and are colored black, as shown in
Figure 6-10.
4. Choose a color from the Fill drop-down list.
These are the colors currently in the Swatches tab of the Assets panel.
Alternatively, you can select a color by clicking the swatch in the Mixer
or Tint tabs of the Mixer and Tints panel and dragging and dropping the
color on the current color swatch in the Object tab.
After you select a color, it is applied to the selected object, or if you
have no objects selected, the fill will be applied to all closed paths you
create until you modify the fill.
If there is no default fill created for an object you’re working on, you can
create one by clicking the Paint Bucket button on the Object tab. This will
add a fill of the default color (which is usually black) to the object.
Creating a gradient fill
When you create a gradient fill, you create a gradual transition of two or
more colors. In FreeHand, you can create the following types of gradient
fills: linear, radial, contoured, logorithmic, rectangle, or cone. Figure 6-11
shows a comparison of the six gradient fill types.
Figure 6-10:
Basic fills

When you create a gradient fill, you specify each color in the fill and where
the color is blended. To create a gradient fill, follow these steps:
1. Use the Pointer tool to select the object to which you want to apply
the gradient fill. The object must have a closed path.
Alternatively, you can deselect all objects in the document, and the fill
you create will be applied to closed paths you create from this point 
forward.
2. Choose Window➪Object and, from the Object tab, select Fill: Basic
from the area underneath the object name in the middle list area.
3. From the Fill Type drop-down list, select Gradient.
The Object tab is reconfigured, as shown in Figure 6-12.

4. Select the appropriate gradient type from the drop-down list beneath
the Fill Type drop-down list.
You can choose Linear, Radial, Contour, Logarithmic, Rectangle, or
Cone. The default gradient fill blends black and white, but you can
choose any color.
5. Click the color swatch at either end of the color ramp (the rectangle
at the bottom of the tab) and choose a color from the color picker.
The color swatch refreshes to show the color you selected. Alternatively,
you can click the color swatch in the Mixer or Tint tabs and drag and
drop the color onto the color swatch on the color ramp.
6. To add additional color points to the gradient, click a color swatch
from the Mixer tab of the Mixer and Tints panel or from the Swatches
tab of the Assets panel and drag and drop it to the desired position
on the color ramp.
You can add as many color points as needed to define your fill. After
adding another color point, you can select a different color by using
any of the methods outlined in Step 5. If you need to move a color
pointer, click the color pointer and drag it to a different position on
the color ramp. To remove a color point, click it and drag it off the
color ramp.
7. Set the options for the type of gradient you’ve selected.
Each of the gradients has slightly different options for tweaking the fill
pattern. In general, though, they include starting points for the gradient,
the angle of the gradient, and the width of the gradient.
Creating a tiled fill
When you create a tiled fill, you copy a shape from within the document
and use it to create a fill that displays the copied object tiled within
another object. You can specify how large the tiled object is and change
the fill’s position within the filled object. To create a tiled fill, follow these
steps:
1. Use the Pointer tool to select the object (or objects) that you want as
the basis for your tiled fill.
2. Choose Edit➪Copy or press Ctrl+C.
The object is copied to the Clipboard.
3. Use the Pointer tool to select the object you want to fill.

Modifying Fills
468
4. Choose Window➪Object and select Tiled from the Fill Type drop-
down list in the Object tab of the Properties panel.
The Object tab is reconfigured to create tiled fills.
5. Click the Paste In button.
The copied shape is pasted into the window and is tiled within the
object you are filling.
6. To resize the object, enter values in the X and Y fields.
Enter values lower than 100 to make the object smaller and values larger
than 100 to increase the size of the tiled object. As you enter values, the
object’s fill changes to reflect the new parameters. Enter the same value
in each field to resize the object proportionately.
7. Enter values in the X and Y Offset fields.
The values you enter move the fill within the object to which it is
applied. Enter positive X values to move the tiled fill to the right,
and negative X values to move the tiled fill to the left. Enter positive
Y values to move the fill up, and negative Y values to move the fill 
down.
8. Drag the circular dial to set the fill’s angle.
Hold down the Shift key to constrain the changes to 45-degree incre-
ments. Alternatively, you can enter a value in the Angle field. Figure 6-13
shows the Object tab being used to create a tiled fill as well as the
object the tiled fill is being applied to.

Using FreeHand’s other fill types
Getting into the nitty-gritty details of how to use FreeHand’s other fill types
goes a little beyond the scope of this book, but we did want to at least men-
tion what they’re used for, lest you see them in the Fill Type drop-down list
and think, “Hey, I got robbed! Nobody told me about these.” Briefly, here’s
what the other Fill types are designed to do:
✦Custom Fill: Nine custom fills are available, and they include things like
bricks, circles, and grass. Each of the fills is editable.
✦Lens: The Lens fill allows you to set up your fill using common photo-
realistic effects, such as transparency, lighten, darken, invert, and
monochrome. Again, each of these effects is editable to your liking.
✦Pattern: The Pattern fill is fun, because you can watch your object
change as you click on little boxes in a grid in the Object tab.
✦Postscript: Postscript fills are standardized repeating patterns. You
won’t be able to see them onscreen — they only appear when you print
your document on a PostScript printer. Onscreen (and when output
from non-Postscript printers) they show up as rows of the letter C.
Postscript fills don’t scale when you scale an object; they have set
sizes. If you’re looking for a place to get started on understanding 
postscript, including links to other sources on the Net, check out
www.postscript.org.
✦Textured: Textured fills work almost exactly like the pattern fills, except
that the fills are more interesting. For this type, they include burlap,
denim, sand, and coarse gravel.
Fun with color, FreeHand style
You can also modify colors in your documents
by choosing Xtras➪Colors and choosing a com-
mand from the submenu. You can use these
commands to lighten, darken, or desaturate
process colors, as well as randomize colors,
sort named colors, and more. We urge you to
experiment with these powerful commands to
further your use of color in FreeHand.

acromedia Studio MX 2004 is a complete package that offers graphic
designers and Web designers a wonderful set of tools to work with.
The applications share some common components, and the interfaces are
similar, making it easy to branch out from one Macromedia Studio applica-
tion to another. In addition to sharing common interface elements,
Macromedia applications can use items created in other Macromedia appli-
cations. For example, you can create a multipage FreeHand document and
export it as a Flash movie. You can also take advantage of FreeHand’s supe-
rior illustration tools to create objects that would be difficult or impossible
to create with Flash or Fireworks. You can then export the objects for use in
a Fireworks document that will be used in a Dreamweaver MX 2004 Web
design, or incorporate the objects in a Flash movie or application. You can
also publish a FreeHand document as HTML that you can modify in
Dreamweaver.
In this chapter, we show you some of the ways FreeHand integrates with
other Macromedia applications. We explain how to export illustrations as
images for the Web and how to export a multipage document for use as a
Flash movie.
Integrating FreeHand with Fireworks
When you create artwork in FreeHand, you can export it for use in a
Fireworks MX 2004 document. You can do this if you prefer the drawing
toolset in FreeHand, but you also need to use the enhanced Web graphics
features in Fireworks to create documents for Web pages. Fireworks also fea-
tures enhanced optimization tools that enable you to optimize an image for
an intended destination, producing a document with the smallest possible

Integrating FreeHand with Macromedia Flash
472
file size with acceptable image quality. You can export documents as image
files, or as AI (Adobe Illustrator) or EPS (Encapsulated PostScript) files, that
can be opened in Fireworks. For information on file types you can open in
Fireworks, refer to Book III, Chapter 8.
In addition to exporting your documents to Fireworks, you can simply save
them as FH11 files and open them directly in Fireworks. Should you choose
to go this route, your layers will be maintained. However, once you edit the
file in Fireworks, you’ll need to save it in the native Fireworks format (PNG). 
Even though you can export a FreeHand document as a PNG file, when you
open the file in Fireworks, all objects and layers are flattened and cannot be
edited.
You can also get FreeHand objects into Fireworks by dragging and dropping.
To do this, create your artwork in FreeHand, and then launch Fireworks. You
then need to resize both application windows so that they are tiled side by
side. At this point, you can drag an object from a FreeHand document into a
Fireworks document.
Integrating FreeHand with Macromedia Flash
If you’ve used Macromedia Flash, you know the software has a wonderful
toolset for creating animations; however, traditional graphic illustrators may
find the drawing tools somewhat quirky. Even though Macromedia Flash has
a powerful Pen tool that enables you to create open and closed paths, if
your background is in graphic illustration, you’ll find the more powerful
FreeHand toolset preferable. In this regard, you can create a multipage docu-
ment using the FreeHand drawing tools to create characters that change
from page to page. In the upcoming sections, we show you how to animate
the artwork you create in FreeHand and export the document as a Flash
SWF movie file.
Creating animations
When you want to animate objects that you intend to use in Flash movies,
you place the objects on separate layers. You can animate objects, groups,
or blends. If you want to animate a single object and make it appear to move
from one point of the page to another, follow these steps:
1. Use the Pointer tool to select the object you want to animate, press
the Alt key, and drag to duplicate the object.
As you drag, FreeHand creates a preview of the duplicate’s current 
position.

Book IV
Chapter 7
Integrating FreeHand with Macromedia Flash
473
2. Release the mouse button when the duplicate object is in the desired
position.
After you create the duplicate, you can use any tool to modify the
shape. Do this when you want the shape to morph during the animation.
For that matter, you can create a different object instead of creating a
duplicate, and then follow the remaining steps to morph from one shape
to another.
3. Select the Blend tool from the Tools panel.
The Blend tool, represented by the icon with three shapes (a blue star
in front and a red circle in the back), is to the right of the Trace tool.
4. Click the original object and drag to the duplicate object.
FreeHand creates a blend between the original and the duplicate
objects.
5. If desired, leave the blended object selected and adjust its properties
in the Object tab of the Properties panel.
By default, the blend consists of 25 steps. You can change the number of
steps as well as other properties.
6. Choose Xtras➪Animate➪Release to Layers.
The Release to Layers dialog box appears.
7. Accept the default Sequence option and click OK.
FreeHand releases the objects to layers.
After you release the blend to layers, you can preview the animation as it
will appear in the Macromedia Flash Player. Note: The animation sequence
is determined by the stacking of layers, and goes from the bottom layer up.
Objects on the Background layer are shown on all frames of the animation.
To preview the animation as a Flash movie, follow these steps:
1. Choose Window➪Movie➪Test.
FreeHand creates an SWF file and opens the movie in another window.
When the window opens, the animation does not automatically play.
2. You control the movie by choosing Window➪Movie and choosing one
of these commands:
• Play: Restarts the movie after you stop it.
• Stop: Stops the movie.
• Rewind: Rewinds the movie to the first frame.
• Step Forward: Advances the movie to the next frame.
Integrating
FreeHand MX

• Step Backward: Rewinds the movie to the previous frame.
• Export: Opens the Export Movie dialog box.
• Movie Settings: Opens the Movie Settings dialog box.
After you preview the movie, close the SWF preview window. The file
you made the movie from is open in the FreeHand window.
Using ActionScript
When you create a document in FreeHand with the intention of exporting it as
a Flash movie, you can integrate ActionScript in the Flash movie. ActionScript
adds a degree of interaction to a Flash movie. You can assign ActionScript to
objects in your FreeHand movie that cause the movie to advance to another
frame, stop, enable users to drag an object from one place to another, and so
on. You choose which event causes the ActionScript to execute; for example,
the downstroke or upstroke of a mouse click. The ActionScript is embedded
in the Flash movie you export. You can assign one of the following actions to
an object in a FreeHand document:
✦Go To: Advances the movie to another frame or scene.
✦Play: Plays the movie frame by frame.
✦Stop: Stops the movie.
✦Print: Prints the frame.
✦Full Screen: Displays the movie in Full Screen mode, regardless of the
document size.
✦Start/Stop Drag: Causes the object to be draggable, based on the event
you choose; for example, when a user presses the mouse button.
You can assign ActionScript to a bitmap image or object in your FreeHand
document by following these steps:
1. Use the Pointer tool to select the object to which you want to assign
ActionScript.
2. Select Window➪Navigation.
The Navigation panel appears, as shown in Figure 7-1.
3. Select an action from the Action drop-down list.
You can select any of the actions listed in the previous bullet list.
4. Select the event that triggers the action from the Event drop-down
list.
For more information on ActionScript events, refer to Book V, Chapter 8.

Book IV
Chapter 7

5. If the action you select requires parameters, the Parameters drop-
down list becomes active. Select the parameter that suits the way you
want the action to execute.
For more information on ActionScript parameters, refer to Book V,
Chapter 8.
6. Close the Navigation panel.
The action is added to the object. Test the movie to make sure the
action executes properly.
Exporting Flash movies
After you create an animation and add ActionScript to objects in the docu-
ment, you can export the document as a Flash movie. You can export the
movie for the Macromedia Flash Player 7. To export your document as a
Flash movie, follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪Export.
The Export Document dialog box appears.
2. From the Save as Type drop-down list, select Macromedia Flash SWF.
3. Click the Setup button.
The Movie Settings dialog box, shown in Figure 7-2, appears.
4. In the Optimization section, select compression options from the Path
Compression and the Image Compression drop-down lists.
The default compression setting is Medium. Select a higher setting to
create a smaller file size with lower image quality. Select a lower setting
for higher image quality at the expense of a larger file size.

5. If your document has dashed lines, you can convert them to individ-
ual objects by selecting the Trace Dashed Strokes check box.
If you select this option, FreeHand creates an individual object for each
dash. This results in a larger file size, but you can edit each dash as
an object if you import the movie into Macromedia Flash. If you don’t
convert the dashed lines to individual objects, they will be converted
to solid lines.
6. Select one of the following options from the Text drop-down list:
• Maintain Blocks: Select this option if you want to be able to edit the
text when you import the file into Macromedia Flash.
• Convert to Paths: Select this option, and FreeHand converts text
objects to paths that cannot be edited as text in Macromedia Flash.
This results in a smaller file size.
• None: Select this option, and FreeHand does not export text objects
with the Flash movie.
7. In the Export Options section, select a Page option.
This determines how many pages of the document are exported as
frames. Select the All option to export all pages, or enter specific page
numbers in the From and To fields.
8. If your document has more than a single page, select the single or
multiple option from the Movie radio button.
If you select the Single option, all the pages in your document will be
exported as a single movie. If you select the Multiple option, each page
will be exported as a separate movie.

9. Select one of the following options from the Layers radio button:
• Animate: Select this option to export each page as a separate SWF
file. Layers on each page are converted to frames.
• Flatten: Select this option to export each page of the document
in a single SWF file. Layers on each page are flattened to a single
image.
10. Accept the default frame rate of 12 fps (frames per second) or enter a
different value.
This value is the number of frames that result in one second of playback
in the Flash movie. Enter a lower value for a smaller file size that may
cause jerky motion when the movie is played; enter a higher value for
smoother motion at the expense of a larger file.
11. Select the Autoplay option (enabled by default), and the movie begins
playing as soon as it loads into the Macromedia Flash Player.
Deselect this option if you have added ActionScript that causes the
movie to begin playing when a user clicks an object in the Flash movie.
12. Select the Full Screen Playback option, and the exported Flash movie
expands to fill the user’s screen.
The user can exit full-screen mode by pressing the Esc key.
13. Select the Protect from Import option, and the movie cannot be
imported into Macromedia Flash MX 2004, or any previous version.
This option prevents other animators from dissecting your handiwork
in any version of Macromedia Flash. Do not select this option if you
intend to use the exported Flash movie as part of another production
you are editing in Macromedia Flash.
14. Click OK.
The Movie Settings dialog box closes.
15. Enter a name for the file and specify the folder to which you want the
file saved.
16. Click the Save button.
FreeHand exports the file as an SWF movie.
A new feature in FreeHand MX allows you to edit the Flash source file of
an imported SWF file by selecting the SWF and clicking the FreeHand to
Flash button in the Object tab of the Properties panel. Edit the movie in
Macromedia Flash and click the Save button. Macromedia Flash exports
the updated movie and closes. The updated SWF shows up automatically
in FreeHand.

Adding navigation links
You can add a navigation link to any object in a FreeHand document. This
option is handy when you intend to publish the document as an HMTL file. To
add a navigation link to an object in a FreeHand document, follow these steps:
1. Use the Pointer tool to select the object to which you want to add the
link.
You can add a link to a text object, a path, or a bitmap image. However,
if you assign a link to an open path, you don’t give the user much of a
target area to click.
2. Choose Window➪Navigation.
The Navigation panel opens, as shown in Figure 7-3.
3. In the Link field, enter the URL you want linked to the object.
This is the Web page that appears in the user’s browser when the link is
clicked. If the Web page is at the same Web site, you only need to enter
the filename of the page you want opened when the link is clicked; for
Figure 7-3:
We’ve typed
a URL in the
Link field
of the
Navigation
panel.

example: myPage.htm. If the file is in a different directory, you need to
enter the relative path to the file; for example, htmldocs/myHtmldoc.
htm. If the Web page resides at another Web site, you need to enter the
absolute path to the Web page, such as http://www.dasdesigns.net/
about.htm.
4. Close the Navigation panel.
The link is assigned to the object and will be written as HTML code
when the document is published as an HTML file.
Publishing a document as HTML
When you create a FreeHand document that you intend to use as a Web
page, you can publish the document as an HTML file that you can edit in
Dreamweaver. When you publish a FreeHand document as an HTML file,
FreeHand writes the HTML code needed to display the objects and bitmaps
in the document in a Web browser, as well as to create any links you assigned
to objects in the document. To export a FreeHand document as an HTML file,
follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪Publish as HTML.
The HTML Output dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 7-4.
2. Click the Setup button.
The HTML Setup dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 7-5.
3. In the Document Root field, enter the folder where the files for your
Web site are stored.
If you’re using the file in a Web site you’ve already created in
Dreamweaver, store the file in the same directory as your Dreamweaver
HTML documents.

4. Select one of the following options from the Layout drop-down list:
• Positioning with Layers: Select this option, and FreeHand creates
HTML code that positions the objects using HTML layers. This
option precisely places each object in the document. Browsers capa-
ble of decoding HTML 3.0 or greater support layers.
• Positioning with Tables: Select this option, and FreeHand creates an
HTML document with a table. Each object in the document is placed
in a table cell. Overlapping objects are sliced or combined to fit
table cells. Most popular Web browsers support tables.
5. Select the option applicable to the language in your document from
the Encoding drop-down list.
The default, Western (Latin 1), is the proper encoding format for the
English language.
6. Select one of the following options from the Vector Art drop-down
list: GIF, JPEG, PNG, or SWF.
This option determines which format FreeHand uses when converting
paths in your document to images that will be displayed in a Web
browser.
7. Select one of the following options from the Images drop-down list:
GIF, JPEG, PNG, or SWF.
The option determines the file format FreeHand uses to convert bitmap
images in your document into images that are displayed when the
HTML document is loaded into a Web browser. If the image has millions
of colors, choose JPEG. If the image has large areas of solid color,
choose GIF.
8. Click OK.
The HTML Setup dialog box closes, and you’re back at the HTML Output
dialog box.

9. Select an option for Pages.
You can publish all pages as HTML documents, or specify a range of
pages to publish.
10. Select the Show Output Warnings option (selected by default), and
FreeHand displays the HTML Output Warnings dialog box when con-
verting the document to HTML.
The HTML Output Warnings dialog box warns you of any potential
anomalies that would prevent the page from displaying properly in a
Web browser.
11. Select the View in Browser or HTML Editor option.
This option is selected by default. When the document is converted,
FreeHand opens the exported HTML document in your default Web
browser. You can specify another Web browser or HTML editor by click-
ing the Browse button and using the Open dialog box to navigate to the
folder where the browser or HTML editor is located.
12. Select the Save as HTML option.
FreeHand converts the file to HTML format and the HTML Output
Warnings window appears (it may be hidden behind the browser
window). The file is displayed in your default browser if you choose
this option. If the file is displayed in a browser, you can check to make
sure the links are working properly. When the file is saved, if you didn’t
specify otherwise in Step 3, FreeHand creates a folder named FreeHand
HTML Output and saves the HTML file to it. Within the FreeHand HTML
Output folder is a subfolder named Images that stores the vector and
bitmaps artwork from the document.
After you publish a document as HTML, you can edit the file by opening it
in Dreamweaver, modifying the document to suit the Web site it will be dis-
played at, and then uploading the file to a Web site. When you upload the
HTML file, you will have to upload any associated images from the Images
folder as well.

f you’re creating a Web site, Macromedia Flash isn’t a necessity. If this is
the case, the question becomes: When and why do you use Macromedia
Flash? The answer is simple: You use Macromedia Flash when you want
your Web site to make greater use of animation, sound, and interactive
graphics. And now, two different flavors of Macromedia Flash MX 2004 are
available. Standard Macromedia Flash MX 2004 is available for people like
you and us, and the hard-core developer can buy Macromedia Flash MX
Professional 2004. For this book, we’re just looking at good old-fashioned
Macromedia Flash by providing an introduction to Macromedia Flash and its
capabilities.
Understanding What Macromedia
Flash Is and How It Works
If someone asks you what Macromedia Flash is, you can quickly say, “It’s a
Web animation program.” However, that statement, while true, doesn’t do
justice to Macromedia Flash’s wide-ranging capabilities.

Understanding What Macromedia Flash Is and How It Works
486
Recognizing what Macromedia Flash can do
Macromedia Flash is a rich program. It is fully programmable and uses its
own language, called ActionScript. Only your creativity limits what you can
do with Macromedia Flash. The following list points out Macromedia Flash’s
major features and may help you decide if you want to use Macromedia
Flash on your Web site:
✦Animate text and graphics, including changing their color and visibility.
✦Create your own graphics or import graphics from another program,
such as FreeHand MX or Fireworks MX 2004.
✦Design Web buttons, still or animated, that link users to other pages or
sites or perform other programmed actions.
✦Add sound and video to your Web site.
✦Add interactivity to your site by enabling viewers to choose where they
go and what they see or hear. You can also create forms for viewers to
fill out, poll viewers’ interests, and customize a site for each viewer.
✦Create a user interface, including scroll bars, check boxes, list boxes,
forms, and more.
You can design an entire Web site using Macromedia Flash. For example, you
can use Flash buttons to create your menu and place the content of your
Web site on the Timeline. (The Timeline is the collection of frames and
layers that make up a Flash movie.) Macromedia Flash gives you complete
artistic freedom when designing your site, while designing in HTML can be
limiting. For example, HTML significantly limits your placement of objects.
On the other hand, when using Macromedia Flash, you need to be careful
that the site displays quickly and is easy to navigate. Also, updates and
server-side connectivity may be more complex and time-consuming with
Macromedia Flash.
Creating content for a Web
site in Macromedia Flash
Using Macromedia Flash has two components. First you create the Flash
document and publish it to a format that a browser can read. Then you (or
others) view the Flash content in a browser. To create Flash content, follow
these basic steps:
1. Create your Flash animation in Macromedia Flash and save it as a
Flash document.
This document has an .fla extension and is often called an FLA file.
(Chapters 2 through 6 and Chapters 8 and 9 in Book V explain the fea-
tures that Macromedia Flash offers for creating Flash documents.)

Book V

487
2. Use the Publish command in Macromedia Flash to save your FLA file
as a Flash movie.
The Flash movie has an .swf extension and is often called an SWF file.
When you publish the movie, Macromedia Flash also generates the
HTML code that you need to insert the SWF file into your Web page. See
Book V, Chapter 7 for detailed instructions.
You sometimes see an FLA file referred to as a movie file. However, cur-
rent Macromedia usage is to call the SWF file a movie. You sometimes
see the SWF file called a Shockwave file, which explains the letters SWF.
However, Macromedia no longer uses this terminology for the SWF file.
3. Insert the HTML code into your Web page (or create a new Web page
and add the HTML code).
The HTML code refers to the SWF file.
After taking these three steps, you follow the procedures that you use for
any Web site — uploading the HTML and SWF files.
Using Macromedia Flash on a Web site
To view a Flash movie, you need the Macromedia Flash Player. Macromedia
Flash Player 6 is the latest player as of this writing. After you have the
Macromedia Flash Player installed, your browser automatically uses the
player to display the Flash animation. The Macromedia Flash Player is a free
download from the following Web site:
www.macromedia.com/shockwave/download/index.cgi?P1_Prod_Version=ShockwaveFlash
Although the vast majority of people who access your Web site will have the
Macromedia Flash Player on their computers already, it is a good idea to
include a button or link on your Web site that connects to this URL so that
people can easily find and download the player if they need it.
Appreciating the Unique Nature of Vector Graphics
Most graphics that you see on a Web site are bitmap files. A bitmap is a
graphic image that’s made up of many tiny dots (bits), which are very close
together. The various colored dots create the pattern that your eyes see as a
picture. When the dots are displayed on a computer screen, they’re called
pixels. To get a bitmap graphic into Macromedia Flash, you import it. See
Book V, Chapter 3 for more details about importing graphics.

Exploring Basic Moviemaking Principles
488
Bitmap graphics can create very large file sizes (although compression can
make the files smaller). Large file sizes mean that your Web page takes
longer to display in a Web browser. Also, bitmaps don’t scale very well, and
they’re difficult to transform. If you need to enlarge a bitmap, you start to
see the individual dots, which results in a grainy graphic image.
Macromedia Flash creates vector graphics. Unlike bitmaps, vector graphics
are defined by equations that specify location, direction, and color. White
space is not recorded. The equations result in small file sizes, and that pro-
vides a faster display on your Web site. Moreover, vector graphics are easily
scalable. No matter how large or small you make your graphic, it always
looks clear. And finally, with vector graphics, it’s easy to transform an image
like a circle into another image, like a triangle.
Not all graphics can be created using vectors. Photographs and other com-
plex designs usually need bitmaps to be displayed in all their glory. Often
you will use a combination of bitmap and vector graphics.
Exploring Basic Moviemaking Principles
Macromedia Flash uses a classic moviemaking structure, which contains the
following components:
✦The Stage: The Stage contains all your content, which includes graphics
and text.
✦Frames: A frame represents a small unit of time, such as 1⁄12 of a second.
Each frame contains a tiny section of the animation.
✦The Timeline: The Timeline contains all the frames. You use the
Timeline to manipulate your content over time and thus create the 
animation.
The Stage
The Stage, shown in Figure 1-1, is a simple rectangle on which you place all
your content. You change the content on the Stage from frame to frame to
create animation. You generally use the drawing and editing tools in the
Tools panel to draw and edit the content on the Stage. In this respect,
Macromedia Flash is a graphic program like many others. You can create
text, circles, lines, and so on, and you can specify the color of the objects
that you create. You can save the graphics in standard Web site bitmap 
formats — JPEG, GIF, and PNG.

489
In the section, “Setting document properties,” later in this chapter, we
explain how to specify the size and color of the Stage.
The Timeline and frames
You can think of the Timeline (refer to Figure 1-1) as the frames in a film reel.
The difference is that Macromedia Flash’s Timeline is electronic, rather than
on film. Each frame covers a specific period of time. The default frame rate
is 12 frames per second (fps), which means that each frame covers 1⁄12 of a
second. You use the frames in the Timeline to control the flow of the anima-
tion. You click a frame to make it current. By specifying which frames con-
tain animation, you determine when animation starts and stops. Book V,
Chapter 5 explains more about working with the frames in the Timeline.
Layers
In Figure 1-1, you can see the Layer list, which includes the default Layer 1,
to the left of the Timeline. Layers are covered in Book V, Chapter 4, but for
now you should understand that you can separate the content on the Stage
into layers. Layers help organize your content so that your graphics and ani-
mations don’t “bump” into each other. You should also use separate layers
for ActionScript and sounds.
Figure 1-1:

Creating a Flash Document File
490
Scenes
A scene is simply a way to organize the Timeline. You can use the default
Scene 1 (refer to Figure 1-1) and ignore scenes altogether. However, when
your animations become more complex, scenes help you keep track of your
movie structure. Scenes are further discussed in Book V, Chapter 5.
Creating a Flash Document File
The first step in creating a Flash document is to start Macromedia Flash MX
2004. In most cases, you have a shortcut on your desktop. Double-click it
to start Macromedia Flash. If you don’t have a shortcut, choose Start➪
Programs➪Macromedia➪Macromedia Flash MX 2004.
When you start Macromedia Flash, you’re immediately in a new movie. To
open an existing movie, choose File➪Open, locate the FLA file, and double-
click it. You often start by creating or importing graphics.
To save a Flash document as an FLA file for the first time, choose File➪Save.
Choose a location on your hard drive or network, type a name, and click the
Save button. After the first save, just choose File➪Save to save your latest
changes.
Taking a Quick Tour of the Macromedia
Flash Interface
The Macromedia Flash interface exists to help you create animation. While
the interface has several components and is very customizable, you will
soon find it easy to use. Refer to Figure 1-1 to see one way of viewing the
interface.
Menus
Most of the commands that you use in Macromedia Flash are on the menus.
Macromedia Flash doesn’t make extensive use of the toolbars that are so
familiar from other programs. The following is a summary of the menu items
and their main features:
✦File: Open, close, and save files; import and export files; print a Flash
document; publish documents (to create SWF movie files); and close
Macromedia Flash.

✦Edit: Undo and redo actions; cut, copy, and paste; delete, duplicate, and
select objects on the Stage; copy and paste frames from the Timelines;
edit symbols (which is covered in Book V, Chapter 3); set preferences;
and create keyboard shortcuts.
✦View: Zoom in and out, change how Macromedia Flash displays objects
and text, choose which parts of the screen you want to display, and
snap objects to pixels on the Stage or other objects.
✦Insert: Insert symbols, insert and delete frames on the Timeline, insert
layers, and create animation (see Book V, Chapter 5).
✦Modify: Edit layers, scenes, the Stage, symbols, frames, and graphic
objects on the Stage.
✦Text: Format text.
✦Command: Create automated tasks that can be used repeatedly on a
variety of objects.
✦Control: Play and rewind animation, test movies and scenes, activate
some interactive features, and mute sounds.
✦Window: Display panels and toolbars.
✦Help: Get help on Macromedia Flash and ActionScript.
Most of the menu commands are discussed in detail in the rest of this book.
Table 1-1 lists some of the commonly used keyboard shortcuts for the menu
commands. After you get used to them, you’ll find that they’re faster than
using the menu. Later in this chapter, we explain how you can create your
own keyboard shortcuts.
It may be helpful to photocopy this table and post it near where you work.

Timeline
The Timeline doesn’t tell you what is happening; it tells you when something
is happening. However, the Timeline does give you clues about the content
of your animation. Figure 1-2 shows a Timeline with plenty of action. (Book
V, Chapter 5 is all about using the Timeline to create animation.)
If the Timeline isn’t displayed, choose View➪Timeline. Note that each layer
has its own Timeline so that you can see the sequence of events separately
for each layer. (See Book V, Chapter 4 for more information about the
Timeline, layers, and the Layer list.) The Timeline has the following features
(see Figure 1-2):
✦Layer list: The Layer list helps you organize your content. For example,
Figure 1-2 shows separate layers for different objects, sounds, and
actions (ActionScript programming).
✦Insert a layer: Use the New Layer button to add a new layer.

✦Delete a layer: Use the Delete Layer button to delete a layer.
✦Playhead: The playhead indicates the current frame.
✦Current frame: The Current Frame box also displays the current frame.
✦Frame rate: The Frame Rate box displays the current frame rate, which
is the number of frames that play per second in an animation.
✦Elapsed seconds: The Elapsed Seconds box displays the number of sec-
onds that have passed from the beginning of the movie to the current
frame, at the current frame rate.
✦Action: A small a in a frame indicates that the frame contains
ActionScript to control the animation.
✦Keyframe with no content: A keyframe is a frame that contains a
change in the animation. If you insert a keyframe but don’t put anything
in that keyframe, the Timeline displays an unfilled circle.
✦Keyframe with content: When a keyframe contains any object, the
Timeline displays a filled circle.
✦Sound: When you insert sound into an animation, its wave appears on
the Timeline.
✦Motion tween: A motion tween is motion animation that Macromedia
Flash calculates automatically from the first and last keyframes. The
Timeline shows motion tweens in light blue.
✦Shape tween: A shape tween is shape (morphing) animation that
Macromedia Flash calculates automatically. The Timeline shows shape
tweens in light green.

The Tools panel
The Tools panel includes all the tools that you need to create and edit
graphics. The Tools panel contains the following sections:
✦Tools: Select, draw, and edit graphic objects and text
✦View: Pan and zoom
✦Colors: Specify the color of lines and fills
✦Options: Specify options for the buttons in the Tools section
Figure 1-3 shows the Tools panel in detail, and you can also see the options
for the Brush tool. See Book V, Chapter 2 for further explanation about the
Tools panel.
All the tools in the Tools panel have keyboard shortcuts. It’s very conven-
ient to pick a tool using your left hand on the keyboard while your right
hand is on the mouse (or perhaps vice versa if you’re left-handed). Table 1-2
lists keyboard shortcuts for many of the tools in the Tools panel.

Panels
You use panels to specify settings (such as colors) or to view information
about objects. You can access the panels from the Window menu, and
panels also have their own Options menus. Click the menu icon in the
upper-right corner of a panel to display its Options menu.
You can organize the Macromedia Flash screen for your convenience. For
certain tasks, you may want one group of panels open; for other tasks, you
may want a different group available, or none at all. Follow these guidelines
when working with panels:
✦Save panel layouts: If you like to work with certain panels open most of
the time, you can save panel configurations. Just display the panels that
you want and choose Window➪Save Panel Layout. Type a name for the
layout, and click OK. The next time that you want to see that layout,
choose Window➪Panel Sets. You’ll see your layout listed on the sub-
menu. Choose it to restore your panel layout.
✦Dock: The panels can be docked at the edge of the screen so that they
don’t cover up the Stage. To dock a panel, drag it by its grabber (the five
dots next to the name of the panel) to the right or bottom of the screen
until it displays a rectangular border. (See Figure 1-4.) To undock a
panel, drag the grabber away from the edge of the screen.
✦Hide/Display panels: Press F4 or Tab to toggle hiding and displaying all
the panels.
✦Stack: You can stack panels one on top of the other to save space. Drag
the panel by its grabber beneath another panel. (See Figure 1-4.)
✦Expand and Collapse: You can collapse a panel to just a title bar when
you need more space on your screen — this option makes it easy to
reopen the panel when you need it again. You can either click the
panel’s title bar or click the Expand/Collapse arrow at the left side of the
title bar. (See Figure 1-4.)

Panels
496
Specific panels are covered throughout the book as appropriate. For exam-
ple, Chapter 2 includes a discussion of colors as well as the panels that you
need to use to create and work with colors.
The Properties panel
The Properties panel is a special panel that you use almost all the time. The
Properties panel is context-sensitive, which means that it changes depend-
ing on what you are doing. For example, if you are working with text, you see
all the possible text properties, as shown in Figure 1-5. If you select a rectan-
gle, you see the properties of that shape. Usually, you keep the Properties
panel open at the bottom of the screen, either expanded or collapsed. The
Properties panel has its own special Expand/Collapse arrow at its lower-
right corner that you use to display additional properties.
To set the properties of an object, select the object and enter the properties
in the appropriate boxes of the Properties panel. Specific details about the
Properties panel are explained throughout the rest of the book in the con-
text of the topics of each chapter.
Library
Every Flash document file has its own Library. Whenever you import a
graphic, video, or sound, Macromedia Flash saves it in the Library. If you save

goes in the Library as well. The Library stores every object that you may use
again. These objects all have names so that you can easily find them.
To use an object from the Library, click the keyframe on the Timeline where
you want the object to appear and drag the object from the Library onto the
Stage. (Keyframes are explained in Book V, Chapter 5.) You can drag an
object from the Preview window or from the item’s listing. Figure 1-6 shows

To keep your Library from becoming overwhelming, use the following
Library tools:
✦Use folders: Organize your Library items into folders. To create a new
folder, click the New Folder icon. Then drag items onto the folder’s
name. Double-click a folder to expand or collapse it.
✦Sort: You can alphabetize Library items by any column. Click the head-
ing of the column. To reverse the sort order, click the Sort Order icon.
✦Rename: Double-click any item, and type a new name.
✦Delete: Select an item, and click the Delete (Trashcan) icon.
Macromedia Flash warns you that this action cannot be undone.
✦Update: If a sound, video, or bitmap file that you have imported has
changed, you can update the Library to use the latest version of that
file. Click the menu icon in the upper-right corner of a panel to display
its Options menu, and then choose Update.
You’re not limited to using items in your current document’s Library. You
can open a Library from any Flash document and drag any of its items into
your movie. Choose File➪Import➪Import to Library, and choose the file.
The new Library opens as a stacked panel on your current Library panel.
To see some sample Library items, choose Window➪Common Libraries. You
find a good assortment of sounds and symbols that come with Macromedia

Macromedia Flash offers lots of opportunities to customize the way it looks
and functions. It’s worthwhile to take a look at these features to make your
work flow as smoothly as possible.
Setting document properties
One of the first things you do when you start a movie is to set the size and
color of the Stage, along with other properties that apply to the entire Flash
document. You can adjust these settings using the Properties panel or the
Document Properties dialog box. To use the Properties panel, follow these
steps:
1. Choose Window➪Properties to display the Properties panel, if it isn’t
already open.
If the Properties panel isn’t expanded, click its title bar to expand it.
2. Click the Stage to make sure that no other object is selected.
The Properties panel looks like the one shown in Figure 1-9.

his chapter shows you how to use the drawing and editing tools in
Macromedia Flash MX 2004 to create graphics and text. To produce
great animation, you need great graphics, so read on.
Choosing When to Use the Macromedia Flash Tools
Book V, Chapter 1 explains the difference between vector and bitmap graph-
ics. You should use the Macromedia Flash drawing tools when you want to
create vector graphics for fast download times.
To create more detailed graphics, you may want to use Fireworks MX 2004
or FreeHand MX, because they have more advanced creation and editing
tools. You may also want to use these programs to edit existing bitmaps. On
the other hand, you may have bitmaps, such as a photograph or complex
logo, that’s only available as a bitmap. To use any bitmap, import it. (See
Book V, Chapter 3 for the scoop on importing graphics.)
Creating Shapes and Text
You use the Tools panel to create shapes and text in Macromedia Flash. See
Figure 2-1 for the details of the Tools panel. The Tools section of the Tools
panel offers many tools for creating and editing images. Most tools have
options that specify how the tool works.

Creating Shapes and Text
508
When creating shapes in Macromedia Flash, you need to keep in mind what
happens when two or more shapes touch, as follows:
✦If the shapes are the same color, they combine. You can use this tech-
nique to create complex shapes.
✦If the shapes are different colors, the top shape replaces and cuts out
the bottom shape.
✦If you use the Pencil or Line tool to intersect any other shape, the line
and other shape are cut at their intersection.
If you don’t see the Tools panel, choose Window➪Tools to make it visible.
Line tool
The Line tool draws straight lines. You can continue to draw connected lines
to create any shape you want.
To draw a line, follow these steps:
1. Choose the Line tool from the Tools section of the Tools panel.
2. From the Properties panel, choose a color by clicking the Stroke
Color box.
If the Properties panel is not visible, choose Window➪Properties to
make it appear.

Selection tool
The first step in changing an object is to select it. To select an object or
group of objects, choose the Selection tool (the dark arrow at the top left of
the Tools panel) and use one of the following techniques:
✦To select one object, click the object.
✦To select several graphic objects that touch each other, double-click
one of the objects. (This doesn’t work with symbols. See Book V,
Chapter 3 for more about symbols.) To select a rectangle’s stroke and
fill, double-click the fill.
✦To select several objects that do not touch, click away from the objects
and drag diagonally to create a bounding box around the objects that
you want to select. Macromedia Flash selects all objects that are com-
pletely inside the box.
See the section, “Reshaping with the Selection tool,” later in this chapter, for
information on reshaping objects using the Selection tool.
The Selection tool has a Snap button in the Options section of the Tools
panel. When you click this button, objects that you move snap to other
objects so that you can attach two objects precisely. The Snap option also
snaps new objects that you create to existing objects.
Lasso tool
Another way to select your objects is to lasso ’em. Use the Lasso tool when
you want to select a number of objects but can’t get them in a rectangular
bounding box. You can drag the mouse and create a free-form shape or use
straight-line segments, as follows:
1. Choose the Lasso tool from the Tools panel.
2. Choose the type of lassoing you want, as follows:
• To lasso free-form: Click anywhere on the Stage, drag around the
objects that you want to select, and then release the mouse button.
• To lasso with straight-line segments: Choose the Polygon button
from the Options section of the Tools panel. Click anywhere on the
Stage, and continue to click at each segment’s end point. Double-
click to finish.
Moving and copying objects
You can move and copy objects on the Stage in many ways. The best
method varies with the circumstances and your personal preferences. Move
and copy objects using the following methods:

Modifying Shapes and Text
518
✦Select and drag: Use the Selection tool to select an object. Then move
the cursor over the object until you see the four-arrow cursor. Click and
drag to move the object. Press and hold Ctrl while you drag to copy the
object.
✦Arrow keys: Select an object and use the arrow keys to move the object
one pixel at a time in the direction of the arrow.
✦Properties panel: Select an object and open the Properties panel.
Click the Expand/Collapse arrow at the lower-right corner to display
the expanded panel. Use the X and Y text fields to set a new location
for the object.
✦Cut, copy, and paste: Select an object; then press Ctrl+X to move (cut)
it or Ctrl+C to copy it. If you want, click another layer or frame. Then
press Ctrl+V to paste the object.
Eraser tool
To delete any object, select it and press Delete. However, to erase part of an
object, use the Eraser tool, as follows:
1. Choose the Eraser tool from the Tools panel.
2. Select the eraser size and shape from the Eraser Shape pop-up menu
in the Options section of the Tools panel.
3. To specify how the Eraser tool works, choose an option from the
Eraser Mode pop-up menu:
• Erase Normal: Erases anything that you drag across.
• Erase Fills: Erases only fills.
• Erase Lines: Erases only strokes.
• Erase Selected Fills: Erases only selected fills.
• Erase Inside: Erases only fills where you first click. Use this option
to erase only fills inside an enclosed area, but leave other fills alone.
4. With the Faucet option (in the Options section of the Tools panel) 
deselected, click and drag to erase.
To erase an entire fill, select the Faucet option (in the Options section of the
Tools panel) and click the fill. This method is equivalent to selecting a fill
and pressing Delete, as if the faucet washed away all the color.
Reshaping with the Selection tool
You can reshape and modify objects using the Selection tool when the objects
are not selected. You can reshape both end points (including corners) and
middles (whether straight or curved), as shown in Figure 2-4, as follows:

Book V
Chapter 2
Using the 
Graphics Tools
Modifying Shapes and Text
519
✦End points: Place the cursor over the end point of a line or curve seg-
ment. You see a small corner shape near the cursor. Click and drag to
change the location of the end point.
✦Middles: Place the cursor over the middle of any line or curve segment.
You see a small curved shape near the cursor. Click and drag to reshape
the segment.
Subselect tool
The Subselect tool looks like the Selection tool, but the Subselect tool is a
white (instead of black) arrow. Both the Selection tool and the Subselect
tool reshape objects, but the Subselect tool uses a more sophisticated tech-
nique. When you are using the Subselect tool, the shape displays anchor
points that you can move or delete. When you click an anchor point, tangent
lines — lines that are parallel to the curve at the anchor point — appear and
enable you to change the direction of the curve. You can reshape strokes or
fills that were created with the following tools:
✦Pen
✦Oval
✦Pencil
✦Rectangle
✦Line
✦Brush
To reshape objects with the Subselect tool, follow these steps:
1. Choose the Subselect tool from the Tools panel.
2. Click a stroke or the edge of a fill to display the anchor points.
3. Drag any anchor point to modify the shape.
4. To change the direction of a curve, select its anchor curve and then
drag the tangent line’s handles (the dots at either end of the tangent
line).

To delete an anchor, select the object and then click the desired anchor
point. The anchor point then turns dark. Then press Delete.
Free Transform tool
The Free Transform tool is the heavyweight of editing tools — it can
do almost anything. To use this tool, choose the Free Transform tool
from the Tools panel and select an object. The object displays a special
bounding box that includes handles and a central transformation point, as
shown in Figure 2-5.
You can use the Free Transform tool in the following ways:
✦Move: Place the cursor over the object. When you see the four-arrow
cursor, click and drag.
✦Rotate: Place the cursor just outside (but not on) any corner handle.
When you see a circular arrow cursor, click and drag.
✦Scale while maintaining proportion: Place the cursor on any corner
handle. When you see a broken two-arrow cursor, click and drag inward
or outward.
✦Scale either the height or width: Place the cursor on any side handle.
When you see a two-arrow cursor, click and drag inward or outward.
✦Skew (slant either horizontally or vertically): Place the cursor any-
where on the bounding box, but not on a handle. When you see the par-
allel line cursor, click and drag in any direction.
✦Move the transformation point: Place the cursor on the transformation
point at the center of the bounding box. When you see a small circle
cursor, click and drag in any direction. The transformation point is used
as a base for rotation and scaling.

✦Taper: Choose the Distort option of the Free Transform tool from the
Options section of the Tools panel. Place the cursor on any corner
handle, and press Shift as you click and drag inward or outward. (See
Figure 2-6 for an example of tapering.)
✦Distort: Choose the Distort option of the Free Transform tool from the
Options section of the Tools panel. Click and drag any handle to distort
the bounding box. (See Figure 2-7 for an example of distortion.) Note:
The Distort option works on shapes, but not on symbols (see Book V,
Chapter 3 for more on symbols), text, or groups. (Groups are explained
in the “Grouping” section, later in this chapter.)
✦Warp: Choose the Envelope option of the Free Transform tool from the
Options section of the Tools panel. Drag any anchor point or tangent
line handle to warp the bounding box.

522
The Envelope option, shown in Figure 2-8, works on shapes, but not on sym-
bols, text, or groups.
When you select an object — for example, a circle — with the Free
Transform tool, you’ll notice that the tool selects the object, but not the
stroke around the object. To select both the object and its stroke, click the
Free Transform tool and drag it around the entire object. This creates one
bounding box for both the fill and the stroke.
Straightening and smoothing with the Selection tool
You can straighten lines and smooth curves with the Selection tool. Both
processes reduce the number of changes in direction. You can repeat the
process until Macromedia Flash can’t straighten or smooth anymore. Follow
these steps to straighten lines and smooth curves:
1. Choose the Selection tool from the Tools panel.
2. Select the shape that you want to modify.
3. To straighten, click the Straighten button from the Options section of
the Tools panel. To smooth, click the Smooth button.
4. Continue to click the Straighten or Smooth button until you like the
result.
Optimizing curves
A process called optimizing curves is similar to smoothing curves.
Optimizing a curve reduces the number of individual elements that the
curve contains and can help reduce the size of your Flash document file.
Follow these steps to optimize curves:

1. Choose the Selection tool from the Tools panel.
2. Using the Selection tool, select the object that you want to optimize.
3. Choose Modify➪Shape➪Optimize.
The Optimize Curves dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 2-9. You
can select Use Multiple Passes for a slower, more thorough approach. If
you select the Show Totals Message check box, the amount of optimiza-
tion displays after you close the dialog box.
4. Choose the amount of smoothing by using the slider in the dialog
box.
5. Click OK.
Carefully check the results after optimizing. Sometimes small objects disap-
pear! If you don’t like the results, choose Edit➪Undo and try again with a dif-
ferent Smoothing setting.
Softening edges
To create a soft look around the edges of a shape, follow these steps:
1. Choose the Selection tool from the Tools panel.
2. Using the Selection tool, select a shape.
3. Choose Modify➪Shape➪Soften Fill Edges.
The Soften Fill Edges dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 2-10.
Figure 2-10:

4. In the Soften Fill Edges dialog box, set the distance.
The distance is the width of the softened part of the edge, in pixels (by
default).
Macromedia Flash uses the units that you set in the Document
Properties dialog box to measure the distance. Choose
Modify➪Document to change the measurement units.
5. Enter the number of steps, that is, the number of concentric rows in
the softened edge.
6. Select Expand or Inset.
The Expand option creates the softened edges outside the shape. The
Inset option creates the softened edges within the shape.
7. Click OK.
Flipping
A great way to make symmetric shapes is to draw half the shape, copy it, and
flip the copy either vertically or horizontally. You can then move the two
shapes together, as shown in Figure 2-11. To flip an object, follow these steps:
1. Choose the Selection tool from the Tools panel.
2. Using the Selection tool, select the object.
3. Choose Modify➪Transform➪Flip Vertical or Flip Horizontal.
Transferring properties with the Eyedropper tool
The Eyedropper tool transfers stroke and fill properties from one object to
another. To transfer properties, follow these steps:
Figure 2-11:
Create this

525
1. Choose the Eyedropper tool from the Tools panel.
2. Select a stroke or fill.
If you select a stroke, the Ink Bottle tool is activated. If you select a fill,
the Paint Bucket tool is activated.
3. Click another stroke or fill.
Macromedia Flash transfers the properties of the stroke or fill to the
second object.
Grouping
You often want to work with several objects at one time. Instead of having to
select all the objects each time you want to move or copy them, you can
group them and work with them as one object. To group objects, select
them and choose Modify➪Group.
You can edit one element of the group by following these steps:
1. Choose the Selection tool from the Tools panel.
2. Double-click the group.
Macromedia Flash dims other objects on the Stage.
3. Edit any element of the group.
4. To return to regular editing, double-click any blank area on the Stage
with the Selection tool.
Alternatively, you can choose Edit➪Edit All.
To ungroup objects, select the group and choose Modify➪Ungroup.
Breaking objects apart
You can break apart text into letters, and then break apart the letters into
shapes. After letters are broken apart into shapes, you can edit them like
any other shape. You can also break apart symbols (see Book V, Chapter 3),
groups, and bitmaps. (See the section, “Working with bitmap fills,” later in
this chapter, for more information.)
Aligning objects
To get a professional look, you may want to make sure that objects are prop-
erly aligned and equally distributed. To align and distribute objects, follow
these steps:

Working with Colors
526
1. Choose the Selection tool from the Tools panel.
2. Using the Selection tool, select the objects.
3. Choose Window➪Align.
The Align panel, shown in Figure 2-12, appears.
4. Choose the options that you want in the Align panel, as follows:
• Use the top row to align the selected objects horizontally or vertically.
• Use the middle row to evenly distribute objects horizontally or verti-
cally by their edges.
• Use the Match Size buttons to match the size of selected objects by
width, height, or both.
• Use the Space buttons to distribute objects by the spaces between
them.
• Use the To Stage button to align or distribute objects relative to the
Stage.
To center an object on the Stage, click the To Stage button on the Align
panel. Then click the middle Align Vertical and Align Horizontal buttons.
However, if you haven’t panned or scrolled your display, you can use a
quicker method — cut and paste the object. Macromedia Flash pastes the
object at the center of the display.
Working with Colors
By default, Macromedia Flash works with a Web safe palette of 216 colors.
These colors are likely to appear the same in all browsers. However, you can

create your own colors. You can also design gradients that vary from one
color to another. Another technique is to fill objects with bitmap images.
This is explained in the “Working with bitmap fills” section, later in this
chapter.
Creating solid colors
You can create a solid color when you need to take more artistic license
than the standard Web safe palette allows. Follow these steps to create a
solid color:
1. Choose Window➪Design Panels➪Color Mixer.
The Color Mixer panel, shown in Figure 2-13 with the Solid option active,
opens.
You can specify colors using the RGB (Red, Green, Blue) or HSB (Hue,
Saturation, Brightness) systems. You can see the current system by the
letters that are next to the text fields in the panel. In Figure 2-13, you can
tell that the RGB system is active because the text fields are labeled R,
G, and B. To choose a different system, click the menu icon in the upper-
right corner of the panel to open the panel’s Options menu and choose
the color system that you want. You can also use the color space in the
panel to specify a color.
2. Select Solid from the Fill Style drop-down list.
3. Click the Stroke Color or Fill Color icon (to the left of the Stroke or
Fill box), depending on whether you want to change a stroke or a fill.
You can use this color later for either a stroke or a fill if you save the
color as a swatch, as outlined in Step 6.
4. Type the color specifications in the text fields, or click a color in the
color space and use the slider to make the color lighter or darker.
Figure 2-13:
The Color
Mixer panel
is the place
to create
new colors.

Working with Colors
528
5. Use the vertical slider next to the Alpha field or text field to set the
transparency of the color.
A higher alpha percent is more opaque.
6. To save the color, create a color swatch by clicking the Options menu
icon in the upper-right corner of the panel and choosing Add Swatch.
Your new color is now displayed in the Stroke Color or Fill Color box in the
Properties panel and in the Colors section of the Tools panel. You can use
any of the tools to work with that color. If you add a color swatch, you can
continue to use that color later by choosing it from the color palette that
opens when you click the Stroke Color or Fill Color box.
Creating gradients
Gradients blend one color (lighter with darker) or many colors in either a
linear or radial (circular) pattern. Gradients give the appearance of shading
and three dimensions. To create a gradient, follow these steps:
1. Choose Window➪Design Panels➪Color Mixer.
The Color Mixer panel opens.
2. From the Fill Style drop-down list, select Linear or Radial to specify
the type of gradient that you want to create, as shown in Figure 2-14.
3. Choose a pointer underneath the horizontal gradient bar.
The pointer becomes black when you select it so that you know it is
active.
4. Use one of the following methods to select a color for that pointer:
• Click the Fill Color box and choose a color.
• Specify a color using one of the methods of creating a new color that
were described in the previous section.
• Use the color space to specify a color.
Figure 2-14:
Use the
Color Mixer
panel to
create
gradients.

Book V
Chapter 2
Using the 
Graphics Tools
Working with Colors
529
5. Repeat Steps 3 and 4 for all the pointers.
You add a pointer when you want to add a new color to the gradient.
Three pointers result in a three-color gradient. To add a pointer, click
just beneath the gradient bar where you want the pointer to appear. To
delete a pointer, drag it off the gradient bar.
6. To save the gradient, click the menu icon in the upper-right corner of
the Color Mixer panel and choose Add Swatch from the Options menu
that appears.
Editing fills
After you create your gradient or bitmap fills, you may decide that you want
to change them. (Bitmap fills are explained in the next section.) To edit a fill,
follow these steps:
1. Choose the Fill Transform tool from the Tools panel.
2. Click a gradient or bitmap fill.
Macromedia Flash places a boundary and editing handles around the
fill, which varies with the type of fill, as shown in Figure 2-15.
3. Make one or more of the following changes:
• Move the fill’s center: Drag the small circle at the center of the fill.
• Change the fill’s width or height: Drag the square handle inward or
outward.
• Rotate a fill: Drag the circle on the editing boundary (the endmost
circle for a radial gradient).
• Scale a bitmap fill: Drag the corner square boundary inward or 
outward.
Figure 2-15:
When you
edit a fill,
you see

Working with Colors
530
• Scale a radial gradient: Drag the middle circular handle on the edit-
ing boundary inward or outward.
• Skew a bitmap fill: Drag a circular handle on the top or side.
Working with bitmap fills
You can create a fill with a bitmap that you have imported. (See Book V,
Chapter 3 for more on importing bitmaps.) To create a fill with a bitmap
image, follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪Import.
The Import dialog box appears.
2. Choose the bitmap file that you want, and click Open.
The bitmap appears on the Stage.
3. Choose Modify➪Break Apart.
This action selects the entire image as a fill rather than as a single color
when the eyedropper is used (in the next step).
4. Choose the Eyedropper tool from the Tools section of the Tools panel.
5. Click the bitmap image.
The Paint Bucket tool is activated, and the Fill Color button (in the
Colors section of the Tools panel and in the Properties panel) displays
the bitmap image.
6. Click the object that you want to fill.
You may have to move the bitmap image that you imported if it covered
your object. Notice that the bitmap is tiled — that is, repeated through-
out the filled area.

Chapter 3: Working with Symbols
In This Chapter
 Understanding the importance of symbols
 Working with graphic symbols
 Working with movie clip symbols
 Working with button symbols
A
symbol is any object or group of objects, an animation, or a Web
button. You give the symbol a name and save it in the Library. (See
Book V, Chapter 1 for a discussion of the Library.) In this chapter, you find
out about symbols and how to use them.
Appreciating the Importance of Symbols
You need to know about symbols if you want to work in Macromedia Flash
MX 2004. The following are the three types of symbols:
✦Graphic: The simplest type of symbol, and a useful way to save groups
of objects that you want to reuse. You can also animate graphic symbols.
✦Movie clip: A little movie that you put inside your big movie. You can
apply ActionScript, Macromedia Flash’s programming language, to a
movie clip or within a movie clip to specify how it functions. The movie
clip has its own Timeline, and you generally insert the movie clip on the
Timeline of the main Flash movie to let it play. Movie clips can be placed
inside each other, or nested. Movie clips are useful for building complex
animation and an interactive Web site.
✦Button: You use buttons when you want your site viewers to click to go
to another page or create some other effect. You use ActionScript to
specify what happens when a viewer clicks a button.
The rest of this chapter explains how to create and work with graphic,
movie clip, and button symbols.

Working with Graphic Symbols
532
Symbols are the building blocks of complex graphics and animation in your
Flash documents. Symbols have the following qualities:
✦You can easily use symbols repeatedly by dragging them from the
Library onto the Stage. Each time you drag something from the Library
onto the Stage, that’s called an instance of the symbol. Individual
instances can be resized.
✦Symbols reduce your file size (for faster browser display) because
Macromedia Flash only stores the symbol definition once and remem-
bers one object instead of many.
✦Symbols (or text or grouped objects) are required for most animation.
✦Symbols keep their integrity, so you can put other objects in front of
them or behind them without the objects being joined or cut out.
Working with Graphic Symbols
You usually create a graphic symbol from objects that you have already cre-
ated. For example, you may have a background that consists of a sky, grass,
flowers, and the sun. Saving these objects as a symbol reduces file size and
ensures that if you copy or move the background, all its components come
along for the ride.
Working with instances of symbols
When you drag a symbol from the Library, the copy on the Stage is called an
instance. You can have many instances of one symbol in a Flash document.
You can change an instance so that it differs from its original symbol, and
the original symbol in the Library remains intact. To change an instance,
follow these steps:
1. Select the instance by clicking it on the Stage with the Selection tool.
Remember that changing an individual instance does not change the
symbol itself.
2. Use the Properties panel to do one or more of the following:
• Change the brightness, color, or transparency by selecting an option
from the Color drop-down list. Select Advanced from the Color drop-
down list to change both color and alpha (transparency) at the same
time.
• Change an instance’s type (graphic, movie clip, or button) by select-
ing an option from the Symbol Behavior drop-down list.

Book V
Chapter 3
Working with
Symbols
Working with Graphic Symbols
533
You can also change the properties of an instance using ActionScript.
For more information on ActionScript, see Book V, Chapter 8. If you
need to refer to a symbol instance in your ActionScript, you can give
that instance a name so that it has a unique name. Select the instance and
enter the name in the Instance Name text field of the Properties panel.
3. Use the Free Transform tool (or other editing tools) in the Tools panel
to rotate, scale, or skew the instance.
Creating graphic symbols
To create a graphic symbol from existing objects, follow these steps:
1. Using the Selection tool from the Tools section of the Tools panel,
select the objects that you want to convert to a symbol.
2. Choose Insert➪Convert to Symbol, or press F8.
The Convert to Symbol dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 3-1.
3. In the Name text field, enter a name for the symbol.
Some people start the names of their symbols with a code that indicates
the type of symbol. For example, you could start your graphic symbols
with gr_ and then add the name of the symbol. This type of nomencla-
ture automatically alphabetizes your symbols by their type and helps to
make clear which type of symbol you are using.
4. Select Graphic from the Behavior list of symbol types.
5. Click OK.
The objects that you selected are now one object, surrounded by a
selection border. The symbol has also been stored, automatically, in the
Library.
You can achieve the same result by creating an empty symbol and then
adding your objects. Follow these steps to do so:
Figure 3-1:
Convert an
object to
a symbol.

Working with Graphic Symbols
534
1. Choose Insert➪New Symbol to open the Create New Symbol
dialog box.
Make sure that no objects are selected when you perform this step. The
Create New Symbol dialog box is the same as the Convert to Symbol
dialog box (refer to Figure 3-1).
2. In the Name text field, enter a name for the symbol.
3. Select Graphic from the Behavior list of symbol types.
4. Click OK.
You now find yourself in symbol-editing mode and are no longer on the
main Timeline.
5. Draw the objects for your graphic symbol.
All these objects become part of your symbol.
6. Choose Edit➪Edit Document to exit symbol-editing mode and return
to the main Timeline.
The symbol is now in the Library and disappears from the screen.
Using graphic symbols
To insert an instance of a symbol, drag it from the Library onto the Stage.
You can drag from the symbol’s icon in the Library list or from its preview at
the top of the Library window.
You can also use a graphic symbol (and any other type of symbol) from
another Flash document file, as follows:
1. Choose Import➪Import to Library.
This opens the Import to Library dialog box, where you can browse for
Flash files.
2. Choose the file that contains the symbol that you want.
3. Click the Open button.
Macromedia Flash opens another Library window.
4. Drag symbols from the new Library window onto the Stage.
Editing graphic symbols
If you change the original symbol, every instance of the symbol that you
have inserted is also changed. This feature can save you lots of time if you
need to change the shape of all your buttons, for example. To edit a symbol,
follow these steps:

Book V
Chapter 3
Working with
Symbols
Creating and Working with Movie Clip Symbols
535
1. Select any instance of the symbol on the Stage.
Although you start by selecting an instance of the symbol, when you
edit it, as described in Step 2, you are editing the symbol, not the
instance.
2. Right-click the symbol instance and choose one of the following:
• Edit in place: This option allows you to edit a symbol while still
viewing other objects on the Stage. The other objects are dimmed so
that you can distinguish them from the symbol.
• Edit: If you select this option, you perform your edits in symbol-
editing mode, which allows you to edit a symbol separately from the
main Stage and Timeline. You see only the symbol.
• Edit in New Window: This option opens a new window, where you
edit the symbol. You see only the symbol.
3. Edit the symbol by changing its color, shape, or effects.
4. Choose Edit➪Edit Document to return to the main Timeline, or if you
chose Edit in a New Window, click the window’s Close button.
You see all the instances of the symbol change to reflect the edits.
To return to individual objects, you can break apart any instance of a
symbol. Select the instance, and choose Modify➪Break Apart.
Creating and Working with Movie Clip Symbols
Movie clips can be used for a number of reasons and in a number of differ-
ent ways. These ways are described as follows:
✦Use a movie clip to create animation that you want to insert or load
onto the main Timeline.
✦Use a movie clip whenever you need to control its functioning with
ActionScript. (For more information on ActionScript, see Book V,
Chapter 8.) For example, you can use ActionScript to control the size or
color of a movie clip. You can also put ActionScript inside a movie clip
to tell the movie to stop at a certain frame. You cannot control a graphic
symbol with ActionScript.
✦You can use movie clips to create interface elements, such as check
boxes, radio buttons, and scroll bars. This type of movie clip is called a
component and is covered in Book V, Chapter 8.

Creating and Working with Movie Clip Symbols
536
✦You can also use movie clip symbols whenever you want to insert ani-
mation into the main Timeline but keep the original movie in the Library
for reuse. Figure 3-2 shows a movie clip in symbol-editing mode that will
be an animation of a bouncing ball. If you want several bouncing balls
on your Web site, you can drag the movie clip onto the Stage as many
times as you want.
You can create a movie clip symbol from scratch or convert animation that
you have created on the main Timeline to a movie clip. To create a movie
clip symbol from scratch, follow these steps:
1. Choose Insert➪New Symbol to open the Create New Symbol
dialog box.
Make sure that no objects are selected when you perform this step.
2. In the Name text field, enter a name for the symbol.
3. Select Movie Clip from the Behavior list of symbol types.
4. Click OK.
You now find yourself in symbol-editing mode and are no longer on the
main Timeline, as shown in Figure 3-2. In Figure 3-2, you can see the
movie clip icon and the name of the movie clip, Bouncing Ball, just
below the layer list.

The symbol is now in the Library and disappears from the screen.
Sometimes you create some animation on the main Timeline and later real-
ize that you need to turn that animation into a movie clip. Follow these
steps to create a movie clip from an animation:
1. On the layer listing, click the first layer on the list, press Shift, and
then click the last layer.
All the layers are now selected. See Book V, Chapter 4 for coverage of
layers.
2. Choose Edit➪Copy Frames.
3. Make sure that no single objects on an individual frame are selected,
and choose Insert➪New Symbol.
The New Symbol dialog box appears.
4. In the Name text field, enter a name for the symbol.
5. Select Movie Clip from the Behavior list of symbol types.
6. Click OK to close the dialog box and enter symbol-editing mode.
7. Click the first frame of the Timeline.
This is the Timeline for the movie clip, not the whole movie.
8. Choose Edit➪Paste Frames.
The frames are copied into the active layer.
9. Choose Edit➪Edit Document to return to the main Timeline of the
movie and exit symbol-editing mode.
The movie clip symbol is now saved in the Library.
10. Delete the original animation by selecting all the layers (as you did in
Step 1) and choosing Insert➪Remove Frames.
You drag a movie clip onto the Stage just like a graphic symbol. Editing a
movie clip is also the same as editing graphic symbols. See the section,
“Working with Graphic Symbols,” earlier in this chapter, for detailed steps.
Working with Button Symbols
Buttons are a major component of Web sites. You can use buttons as links to
move to other pages and sites, and some buttons trigger more complex
actions, such as stopping music or starting an animation.

Working with Button Symbols
538
A button has the following states, which you define when you create the
button:
✦Up: The appearance of the button when the mouse cursor is not over
the button.
✦Over: The appearance of the button when the mouse cursor is over the
button, but not clicking it.
✦Down: The appearance of the button when the button is being clicked.
✦Hit: The area of the button that responds to the mouse. This area is
invisible. The hit state is often the same as the down state, because it
just defines the active area of the button.
A common technique is to design a button that changes color or size when
the cursor passes over the button and then changes again when clicked.
This technique provides feedback that the button has responded to the
user. Figure 3-3 shows a button’s four states.
Creating simple button symbols
Creating a button involves designing the look of the button for the first three
states and the size of the button for the Hit state. Often, you add text to the
graphic so that people know what the button is for. Follow these steps to
create a button:
1. Choose Insert➪New Symbol.
The Create New Symbol dialog box appears.
2. In the Name text field, type a name for the button.
3. From the list of behaviors, select Button and click OK.
Figure 3-3:
The four
button
states: up,
over, down,
and hit.
Notice how
each state
has a
slightly
different fill.

Book V
Chapter 3
Working with
Symbols
Working with Button Symbols
539
You now see the Button Timeline. The dot in the Up frame indicates that
the frame is a keyframe. (See Book V, Chapter 5 for more information on
keyframes.) The Up frame is active.
4. Draw the button for the Up state.
You can create the graphic with Macromedia Flash’s drawing tools, an
imported graphic, or an instance of a symbol.
Place the graphic for all the button states at the center of the display.
(Book V, Chapter 2 explains how to center objects.) If the button images
aren’t all in the same place, the button shifts when the viewer passes
the cursor over or clicks the button.
5. Click the Over frame, and choose Insert➪Keyframe.
The graphic that you created for the Up state is still on the Stage.
6. Draw the button for the Over state.
Use the graphic for the Up state and change it (or leave it the same if
you want), or delete the graphic and draw a new one in its place.
7. Click the Down frame and choose Insert➪Keyframe.
8. Create the graphic for the Down frame (as in Step 6).
9. Click the Hit frame and choose Insert➪Keyframe.
10. Create the shape that defines the active area of the button.
This shape should completely cover all the graphics of the other states.
Usually a rectangle or circle is enough. If you ignore the Hit frame,
Macromedia Flash uses the boundary of the objects in the Up frame.
If you use text for the button, viewers have to hit the letters precisely,
unless you create a hit area around the text.
11. Choose Edit➪Edit Document to return to the regular Timeline.
To place a button on the Stage, use the Selection tool to drag the button
from the Library to create an instance of the symbol. To edit a button,
double-click it in the Library.
Adding pizzazz to buttons
Buttons don’t have to be simple. You can make your buttons more interest-
ing in the following ways:
✦Add a sound: You add a sound to a button’s Timeline in symbol-editing
mode in the same way that you add a sound to a frame on the main
Timeline. See Book V, Chapter 6 for information on adding sounds.

Working with Button Symbols
540
✦Add animation: Create a movie clip symbol, as described in the section,
“Creating and Working with Movie Clip Symbols,” earlier in this chapter.
Click the keyframe of the button’s Timeline that you want to contain the
movie clip; for example, click the Over keyframe. Delete any existing
graphic, and drag a movie clip symbol that contains animation from the
Library onto the screen.
✦Add interactivity: In order for the button to do something, it needs
some ActionScript. Drag an instance of the button onto the Stage, and
select that instance by clicking it once with the Selection tool. Then use
the Actions panel to add ActionScript to the button. See Book V,
Chapter 8 for specific information about using ActionScript.
Testing buttons
After you have created a button, you should drag an instance of it onto the
Stage and test it. To test simple buttons, follow these steps:
1. Choose Control➪Enable Simple Buttons.
2. Pass the cursor over the button, and click it to see if the effects work.
3. To select the button by clicking it, choose Control➪Enable Simple
Buttons again to disable the button.
If your button contains movie clips, you need to test the entire movie to test
the button. Choose Control➪Test Movie, and test the button. To close the
movie window, click its Close button.

Chapter 4: Making Your
Life Easier with Layers
In This Chapter
 Getting familiar with layers
 Working with layers
 Changing layer options
 Using folders to manage layers
L
ayers are a way to organize your Flash document. Layers are an impor-
tant part of creating a movie for the following reasons:
✦Layers keep objects from bumping into each other. If you draw two cir-
cles and overlap them, they either merge or one creates a cut out of the
other. However, if you put the two circles on two separate layers, they
each remain whole.
✦Each animated object must be on its own layer. If you want more than
one object on the Stage at a time, you need to create a new layer.
✦ActionScript and sounds should have their own layer. This allows you
to easily find and troubleshoot any problems as well as to avoid poten-
tial conflicts.
✦Special types of layers let you create special effects, as follows:
• Mask layers: Mask layers create a “keyhole” through which you can
see layers beneath it.
• Guide layers: Guide layers direct animation along a path.
In addition, you can use layers for your own organizational purposes. For
example, you can put text on a separate layer. Then, to focus on just the
text, you can hide all the other layers. In this chapter, we explain how to
create and manage layers.

Working with the Layer List
542
Layers add a third dimension to the organization of your Flash document.
The Stage lays out your graphics in the horizontal (X-axis) and vertical (Y-
axis) dimensions. Using layers is like adding a Z-axis, enabling you to place
graphics on top of each other as if they were on successive transparent
sheets.
The Timeline, of course, adds the fourth dimension — time. Layers are inti-
mately connected to the Timeline. For each layer, Macromedia Flash adds a
row of frames in the Timeline.
Working with the Layer List
You work with layers on the Layer list, which is to the left of the Timeline, as
shown in Figure 4-1. The Layer list contains the following features:
✦Default layer: You start a new movie with the default layer, Layer 1.
✦Active layer: The active layer is highlighted. When you create objects,
they go on the active layer.
✦Show/Hide Layers: You can show or hide objects on any layer by click-
ing the Show/Hide icon for that layer.
✦Lock/Unlock Layers: You can lock any layer so that objects cannot be
selected or edited. Click the Lock icon for that layer. To unlock a layer,
click the Lock icon again.

543
✦Display Outlines: You can display objects on a layer as outlines. Each
layer uses a different outline color. Outlines may help you see objects
on all layers more clearly. Click the Outlines icon for any layer.
✦Insert Layer: To insert a layer, click the Insert Layer button below the
Layer list.
✦Insert Motion Guide: To add a motion guide layer, click the Insert
Motion Guide button below the Layer list. See the section, “An introduc-
tion to guide layers,” later in this chapter, for more information on guide
layers.
✦Insert Layer Folder: You can organize layers into folders. Click the
Insert Layer Folder button below the Layer list.
✦Delete Layer: To delete a layer, select it and click the Delete Layer
button, or drag the layer to the Delete Layer button.
Working with Layers
When you open a new movie, it has one layer, called Layer 1. As you work,
you create, delete, move, and copy layers. You also name your layers.
Choose a naming system that makes sense to you. Note: If the names are too
long, you won’t be able to see the whole name in the Layer list, so don’t get
too extravagant. You can drag the right border of the Layer list to the right
to see more of the layer names.
Creating layers
When you need to create a new layer, click the Insert Layer button at the
bottom of the Layer list (refer to Figure 4-1) or choose Insert➪Timeline➪
Layer. The new layer appears above the active layer and becomes the active
layer.
You can also create a new layer by right-clicking a layer in the Layer list and
selecting Insert Layer from the contextual menu that appears.
You should rename the new layer immediately after you create it. Double-
click the layer name, type a new name, and press Enter.
Using layers
When you draw an object, it appears on the active layer, which is the layer
that is highlighted and has a pencil icon next to its name in the Layer list. To
draw on a different layer, click the name of the layer that you want to use.
When you click a new layer, Macromedia Flash selects all the objects on that
layer. To deselect the objects, click any empty area (on the Stage or in the
gray space around the Stage).

Working with Layers
544
Editing layers
You often need to make changes to layers or move objects from one layer to
another. Keeping your layers organized is an important part of keeping your
entire movie under control.
Selecting layers
When editing layers, you may want to select more than one layer at a time,
such as when you need to move more than one layer at a time. To select a
group of layers that are all together, click the first layer name on the Layer
list, press and hold down Shift, and click the last layer of the group. To
select layers that are not together, click the first layer, press and hold down
Ctrl, and click any additional layers that you want to select.
Moving objects from one layer to another
You often draw objects before you realize that they need to be on a separate
or different layer. For example, you can only have one object on a layer that
you are animating. If you draw additional objects on that layer, you should
move them to another layer. First create a new layer, if necessary. (See the
section, “Creating layers,” earlier in this chapter.) To move objects from one
layer to another, follow these steps:
1. Select the frames that represent the objects that you want to move by
using the Selection tool.
The layer that contains the objects is also made current. To select more
than one frame, select the first frame, press and hold down Shift, and
then select the last frame.
2. Choose Edit➪Cut.
3. In the Layer list, click the layer to which you want to move the
objects.
4. Choose Edit➪Paste in Place.
The objects appear to be in the same location, but they are now on a
new layer.
Distributing to layers
A great feature is the ability to distribute all objects on a layer to separate
layers. For example, to animate each letter of a word, you should put each
letter on a separate layer. For example, you may want to animate the letters
of the word now so that each letter flies onto the Stage separately. Follow
these steps to do so:

Book V
Chapter 4
Making Your Life
Easier with Layers
Working with Layers
545
1. Select the text or objects using the Selection tool.
For the purposes of this example, select the Text tool from the Tools
section of the Tools panel, type now in a single frame, and then select
the text.
2. If you are working with text, choose Modify➪Break Apart.
You see a separate box around each letter. Each letter is now a separate
object.
3. Choose Modify➪Timeline➪Distribute to Layers.
Each object or letter is now on a separate layer. Macromedia Flash auto-
matically creates the layers for you. In the “now” example, Macromedia
Flash creates three layers, named n, o, and w for each of the three letters.
The objects also remain on their original layer. You can delete that layer
if you want and keep only the copies on the individual layers.
Renaming layers
If the content of a layer changes, you should rename the layer to something
that is appropriate to its content. To rename a layer, double-click the layer
name in the Layer list, type the new name, and press Enter.
Deleting layers
To delete a layer, select the layer in the Layer list and click the Delete button
(it looks like a trashcan) at the bottom of the list. (Refer to Figure 4-1.)
Deleting a layer deletes everything on that layer. Be aware that you may not
be able to see everything on the layer, because you see only what is on the
Stage in the current frame. To see what is on a layer throughout the
Timeline, follow these steps:
1. Right-click the layer name in the Layer list, and choose Hide Others
from the contextual menu that appears.
2. Click the first frame on the Timeline.
3. Press Enter to run the animation.
Copying layers
You can copy an entire layer, and if you do, all the objects on that layer are
copied as well. Follow these steps to copy a layer:

Working with Layers
546
1. Select the layer by clicking the layer’s name in the Layer list.
Selecting the layer selects all the objects on the layer.
2. Choose Edit➪Copy Frames.
3. Choose Insert➪Layer to create a new layer.
4. Choose Edit➪Paste Frames.
Reordering layers
Macromedia Flash displays objects in the order of their layers, from the top
down. In other words, objects on the top layer appear in front of objects on
the next layer on the list. You can reorder the Layer list to change what
objects appear in front on the Stage. See Figure 4-2 for an example.
To move a layer to a different spot in the Layer list, click and drag the layer’s
name to the desired location, and then release the mouse button.
An introduction to guide layers
A guide layer is a special type of layer that is invisible when your Flash docu-
ment is published and played as a movie. Guide layers have the following
main purposes:
✦Drawing guide: You can place gridlines on the Stage to help you lay out
the objects on the Stage, or you can import a bitmap and use it as a
guide to help you draw using the graphics tools. The content on the
guide layer is invisible when the movie is published, but having the
extra layer helps you draw.
Figure 4-2:
By changing
the layer
order, you
change
which
objects
appear in
front on

Book V
Chapter 4
Making Your Life
Easier with Layers
Working with Layers
547
✦Motion guide: You can place a path on a guide layer that controls
the animation of an object. This process is described in more detail in
Book V, Chapter 5.
To create a drawing guide layer, follow these steps:
1. Click the Insert Layer button on the Layer list.
2. Right-click the layer and choose Guide from the contextual menu that
appears.
The layer icon changes to the guide icon that looks like a hammer.
Using mask layers
A mask layer hides everything on its connected masked layers, except
what’s inside the objects that are on the top mask layer. It, in effect, masks
the content on the lower layers. Masks are often used to create a spotlight
effect, where you only see what is in the spotlight and everything else is
hidden. You can see this effect in Figure 4-3, where the circular mask hides
everything outside of the circle. The circle is on a mask layer, and what you
see inside the circle is on a masked layer.
Figure 4-3:
The circular
mask hides
everything
except what
is inside the
circle.

Changing Layer Options
548
To create a mask layer, follow these steps:
1. On the top layer of the Layer list, create the objects that you want to
be visible through the mask.
2. With the top layer selected, click the Add Layer button at the bottom
of the Layer list.
3. Draw a shape, such as a circle, on this new layer.
4. Right-click the new layer and choose Mask from the contextual menu
that appears.
In the Layer list, the mask layer is locked and the masked layer is both
locked and indented. (Refer to Figure 4-3.)
To edit a mask or masked layer, click the lock next to the layer name in the
Layer list. Unlocking these layers removes the mask effect. After you have
finished editing, click the lock column next to the layers’ names again to
redisplay the mask effect.
To link a layer to a mask layer, drag the layer directly underneath a mask
layer. The layer is indented. To display the mask effect, make sure that the
layer is locked by clicking it under the Lock column in the Layer list.
Changing Layer Options
You can control the visibility, editability, and display of objects on layers.
These tools are very helpful when you are trying to isolate certain objects
for editing or animation.
Altering the visibility of objects
You can hide all the objects on a layer. If you have a lot of objects on the
Stage and want to edit objects on one layer, you can hide other layers that
you don’t need to see at the moment.
Don’t forget about objects on hidden layers. These objects still appear in
your published movie.
To hide a layer, click beneath the Eye icon on the layer’s row. An X appears
in the Eye column to show you that the layer is hidden. Click the X to
unhide the layer.
To hide all layers except one, right-click the layer that you want to see and
choose Hide Others from the contextual menu that appears.

549
Locking and unlocking layers
You can lock the objects on a layer so that you cannot edit them. You may
find yourself inadvertently selecting objects that you want to leave alone. This
can get annoying, but you can easily avoid the situation by locking that layer.
To lock a layer, click beneath the Lock icon on the layer’s row. A lock
appears in the Lock column. Click the lock to unlock the layer.
To lock all layers except one, right-click the layer and choose Lock Others
from the contextual menu that appears.
Setting layer properties
Many of the layer controls that we discuss in this chapter are combined in
the Layer Properties dialog box, as shown in Figure 4-4. Most of the time,
you just use the controls on the Layer list or the contextual menu that you
see when you right-click a layer. However, the Layer Properties dialog box
does have some unique features.
To open the Layer Properties dialog box, select the layer that you want to
modify and choose Modify➪Timeline➪Layer Properties. You can use this
dialog box to do the following things:
✦Rename the layer: Type a new name in the Name text field.
✦Show/Hide the layer: Select or deselect the Show check box.
✦Lock/Unlock the layer: Select or deselect the Lock check box.
✦Change the type of layer: You can turn a layer into a guide, guided,
mask, masked, or folder layer.
✦Change the outline color: Click the Outline Color swatch to choose a
new color.
Figure 4-4:
The Layer
Properties
dialog box.

Using Folders to Manage Layers
550
✦Turn outlines on/off: Select or deselect the View Layer as Outlines
check box.
✦Change layer height: Select a percentage from the Layer Height drop-
down list. This increases the physical size of the layer to make it more
viewable.
When you finish making changes, click OK to close the Layer Properties
dialog box.
Using Folders to Manage Layers
If you have many layers, you can organize them into folders. For example,
you may want to put all your layers containing text in one folder.
To create a folder, click the Insert Layer Folder icon at the bottom of the
Layer list. A new folder appears above the current layer. Double-click the
folder name, and enter a name that describes the folder’s contents.
Use the following tips to manage folders:
✦Put layers in a folder: Drag layers onto the folder’s row.
✦Collapse and expand individual folders: Click the arrow at the left of
the folder’s icon.
✦Expand and collapse all folders: Right-click the Layer list, and choose
Expand All Folders or Collapse All Folders from the contextual menu
that appears.
✦Remove a layer from a folder: Expand the folder, if necessary, and drag
the layer above the folder name or to another location where it doesn’t
darken a folder.
✦Hide or lock an entire folder and its layers: Click beneath the Eye or
Lock icon on the folder’s row.
✦Reorder folders: You can change the order of folders, which also
changes the order of its layers. Just drag any folder up or down.
✦Delete folders: Select the folder and click the Delete (trashcan) icon.
Deleting a folder deletes all the layers in the folder and everything on those
layers. Macromedia Flash warns you of this if you try to delete a folder.

acromedia Flash MX 2004 is basically an animation program, so this
chapter on animation is central to the whole purpose of Macromedia
Flash. In this chapter, we provide the information you need to create motion
and shape animation.
Getting Familiar with the Timeline
The Timeline lays out your animation in time. In order to animate, you need
to be thoroughly familiar with the Timeline (shown in Figure 5-1) and its spe-
cial coding.
As you can see in Figure 5-1, every fifth frame on the Timeline is numbered
and each layer has its own row in the Timeline. (For more information on
layers, see Book V, Chapter 4.)

information
about your
animation.

Getting Familiar with the Timeline
552
If the Timeline isn’t visible, choose Window➪Timeline. You can collapse the
Timeline by clicking its Collapse/Expand arrow at the left side of its title bar.
Understanding the frame rate
The frame rate is the speed at which Macromedia Flash plays the animation.
The default frame rate is 12 frames per second (fps). You can have only one
frame rate per document. To change the frame rate, follow these steps:
1. Double-click the Frame Rate box at the bottom middle of the
Timeline.
The Document Properties dialog box appears.
2. In the Frame Rate text field, enter a new number in frames per
second.
3. Click OK.
When you use a frame rate that is too slow, the animation appears jerky.
Increasing the frame rate may make animation appear smoother, but a frame
rate that is too fast can appear blurred. The default frame rate of 12 fps is a
good place to start.
The Internet connection rate and the size of the file also affect the rate of
animation. A large file (often due to large graphics or sounds) and a slow
Internet connection can make the animation stutter. Your viewers will get
the best results if you reduce the size of the file as much as possible. In
Book V, Chapter 7, we explain how to optimize files for the Web.
Working with the Timeline
You can work with the Timeline in the following ways:
✦Go to a frame: Click the frame on the Timeline to go to a particular
frame. If you want to work on a specific layer, click the frame in that
layer’s row.
✦Change size and appearance of the frames: To modify the frames as
they appear in the Timeline, click the Frame View button in the upper-
right corner of the Timeline and choose one of the options from the
menu. You can change the width and height of the frames, turn coloring
of frames on and off, and choose to display a small thumbnail of the
frame’s content in each frame.
✦Add a label or comment to a frame: To add a label or comment to a
frame in the Timeline, select a frame and type a label name in the Frame
Label text field in the Properties panel.

553
✦Select frames: Click a frame and drag across the frames you want to
select. (You can also click the first frame, press Shift, and click the last
frame you want to select to select all the frames in between.)
✦Copy and paste frames: Select the frames you want to copy, choose
Edit➪Timeline➪Copy Frames, click where you want the frames to go,
and choose Edit➪Timeline➪Paste Frames.
✦Move frames: Select the frames you want to move and drag them to the
desired location.
✦Add a frame: To add a frame, right-click on the frame to the left of
where you want to create a frame and choose Insert Frame from the
contextual menu that appears.
✦Delete frames: Select the frames you want to delete. Right-click and
choose Remove Frames.
✦Add a keyframe: Right-click on the desired frame and choose Insert
Keyframe from the contextual menu.
✦Change the length of an animation: Press Ctrl and click and drag the
first or last keyframe of the animation to the right or left.
✦Scroll along the Timeline: Use the horizontal scroll bar to scroll along
the Timeline. Use the Vertical scroll bar (which appears when you have
too many layers to display) to scroll through the layers.
Onion skinning
When you animate an object, you can display some or all of the animated
frames at once, using an effect known as onion skinning. Onion skinning pro-
duces overlapping translucent images like the translucent layers of an
onion. See Figure 5-2 for an example of onion skinning.
To work with onion skinning, use the buttons under the Timeline:
✦Onion skin: Turns on onion skinning and adjusts the Onion markers to
customize the number of frames that display the effect.
✦Onion skin outlines: Displays single-color outlines of your animation.
✦Edit multiple frames: Enables you to edit any of the frames on the
Timeline, regardless of the current frame.
✦Modify onion markers: Displays a menu that enables you to always
show the markers (even when onion skinning is off), anchor the mark-
ers so they don’t follow the playhead (current frame marker), and set
the number of frames that the markers cover.

Using Frames and Keyframes
554
Using Frames and Keyframes
A frame is actually a unit of time, based on your frame rate. You can place
content on any frame, but you can only change content on a keyframe. Use a
keyframe whenever you want to start or stop an animation or make any
object appear or disappear.
To introduce any new object onto the Stage, you must have a keyframe.
Insert a keyframe by right-clicking to the left of where you’d like the
keyframe and selecting Insert Keyframe from the contextual menu. Click the
keyframe on the layer where you want the object to appear, and then do one
of the following:
✦Draw something by using the Macromedia Flash drawing tools. (See
Book V, Chapter 2.)
✦Import a bitmap. (See Book V, Chapter 3.)
✦Drag an object onto the Stage from the Library. (See Book V, Chapter 1.)

Chapter 5
Creating Animation
Creating Animation Frame-By-Frame
555
You can create two types of animation in Macromedia Flash:
✦Frame-by-frame: In frame-by-frame animation, each frame is a keyframe
and contains a slight change in your objects so that when you play the
Flash document, you see a smooth animation. This type of animation is
time-consuming and creates bigger files, but it may be necessary to
create complex effects. Cartooning is mostly done using frame-by-frame
animation.
✦Tweening: In tweening, the first and last frames of the animation are
keyframes, and Macromedia Flash calculates everything in between.
You can tween motion and shapes (morphing). Tweening is faster to
create than frame-by-frame animation and creates small file sizes. The
only down side to tweening is that it can’t be done with any type of
object except vector graphics.
Creating Animation Frame-By-Frame
When your animation does not have a simple pattern, such as movement of
one object in a direction or the change of one shape to another shape, you
need to use frame-by-frame animation. A common example of frame-by-
frame animation is cartooning, where a figure needs to move in complex
ways or a mouth moves in synchrony with speech.
To create frame-by-frame animation, follow these steps:
1. Right-click a frame in the current layer where you want the anima-
tion to start and choose Insert Keyframe from the contextual menu.
2. Draw or import your image.
Book V, Chapter 2 is all about creating graphics. To import an image,
choose File➪Import.
3. Right-click the next frame and choose Insert Keyframe again.
4. Change the graphic slightly to create the second frame of the 
animation.
5. Repeat Steps 3 and 4 as necessary until you have completed your 
animation.
See Figure 5-3 for an example of frame-by-frame animation.
During the process, press Enter to play back your animation and check your
work.

Creating Tweened Motion Animation
556
Creating Tweened Motion Animation
Motion tweening moves a single symbol instance, text object, or grouped set
of objects either in a straight line or along a path that you draw (often with
the Pencil tool).
Although you can motion tween only one object at a time on any layer, you
can tween other objects on other layers to create the overall look of many
objects being animated.
You can also change the size, rotation, skew (slant), color, and transparency
of symbol instances as you motion tween them. To make these changes to
text or groups, convert them to symbols. See Book V, Chapter 3 for a discus-
sion of symbols.
Preparing to tween
You can only put one object — symbol instance, text, or group — on the
layer where you are animating. The first step is to create the object you
want to animate and make sure that nothing else is on that layer. Often, you
create a new layer just for your animation.
Decide how you want your object to move. Do you want its color, size, or
rotation to change? After you have decided, you are ready to tween.
The Macromedia Flash Controller is like a control panel for a CD or video
player. The Controller is helpful when you animate because it offers controls
for rewinding and playing your animation. To open the Controller, choose
Window➪Toolbars➪Controller.

Creating a simple tween
Before you tween, open the Properties panel by choosing Window➪
Properties. To create a simple motion tween that moves the object along
a straight line, follow these steps:
1. On your animation layer, insert a keyframe where you want the ani-
mation to start.
To add a keyframe, right-click on the frame to the left of where you want
to create a keyframe and choose Insert Frame from the contextual
menu.
2. Click the keyframe and create the object or objects you want to 
animate.
You cannot tween plain graphics. If necessary, turn your object or
objects into a symbol (see Book V, Chapter 3) or a group (see Book V,
Chapter 2). Text is fine as it is. You can also import a graphic or drag an
instance of a symbol from the Library onto the Stage.
3. Insert a keyframe where you want the animation to end.
The longer the span of frames is, the slower the animation. You can
always adjust the length of a tween later, as explained in the “Working
with the Timeline” section, earlier in this chapter.
4. Click the last keyframe and then move the object to its new location
using the Selection tool.
At this point, you can also change the object’s color properties and
transparency by using the Color box in the Properties panel. In addition,
you can use the Free Transform tool or other Macromedia Flash com-
mands to change the object’s size, rotation, and skew, as shown in
Figure 5-4.
5. Select the range from keyframe to keyframe by clicking the first
keyframe and dragging to the last keyframe.
If the span of frames is too long to show, click the first keyframe, scroll
to the last keyframe, press Shift, and click the last keyframe.
You can click anywhere between the keyframes and get almost the exact
same result as the technique in Step 5. The last keyframe isn’t tweened,
but the result looks the same when you play the animation.
6. From the Tween drop-down list in the Properties panel, select
Motion.
If you changed the object’s size, select the Scale check box in the
Properties panel to tween the size.

Creating Tweened Motion Animation
558
7. If you want to rotate the object during the tween (in addition to any
rotation you created in Step 4), select CW (clockwise) or CCW (counter-
clockwise) from the Rotate drop-down list in the Properties panel, and
then enter the number of rotations in the Rotation Count text field.
To test your animation, click the first keyframe and press Enter or use
the Controller to rewind and play your animation.
You can accelerate or decelerate the speed of the tween. To accelerate from
beginning to end, enter a value between –1 and –100 in the Ease text field in
the Properties panel. To decelerate, use a value between 1 and 100.
See Figure 5-4 for an example of a ball that moves along a diagonal line. The
ball also becomes smaller, so that it appears to recede in the distance as it
moves.
Motion tweening along a path
To tween along a path that is not a straight line, you need to draw the path
on a guide layer. (See Book V, Chapter 4 for the steps to create a guide
layer.) Your animation is on the guided layer that is associated with the
guide layer. Figure 5-5 shows an example of a motion tween along a path.

Chapter 5
Creating Animation

559
To create an animation that moves along a path, follow these steps (which
start just like the steps for simple motion tweening):
1. On your animation layer, insert a keyframe where you want the ani-
mation to start.
To add a keyframe, right-click on the frame to the left of where you want
to create a keyframe and choose Insert Frame from the contextual
menu.
2. Click the keyframe and create or import the object or objects (symbol
instance, group, or text) you want to animate.
3. Insert a keyframe where you want the animation to end.
4. Select the range from keyframe to keyframe by clicking the first
keyframe and dragging to the last keyframe, or click anywhere
between the two keyframes.
5. From the Tween drop-down list in the Properties panel, select
Motion.
6. In the Properties panel, select the Snap check box to snap the object
to the path.
Figure 5-5:
The star

shown
with onion

Creating Tweened Shape Animation
560
7. If you want the object to rotate in the direction and angle of the path,
select the Orient to Path check box.
8. Right-click the object’s layer and select Add Motion Guide.
The new layer is added. The layer is labeled Guide, and the object’s
layer is indented beneath it.
9. On the guide layer, draw your path using the Pen tool.
10. Click the first keyframe of the object’s layer and drag the object by its
registration point (a small plus or circle) to the beginning of the path
until the registration point snaps to the path.
11. Click the last keyframe of the object’s layer and drag the object by its
registration point to the end of the path until the registration point
snaps to the path.
12. Press Enter to play the animation.
If you need to change your path, use the Macromedia Flash editing tools
to edit the path you created. You can use the Selection or Subselection
tools to edit the path. (See Book V, Chapter 2 for details.)
The guide path is not visible in the published movie. However, you often don’t
want to see the path even in your document, so you can more easily visualize
the animation. Just click the eye column of the guide layer to hide it.
Creating Tweened Shape Animation
If you want your objects to change shape, you need shape tweening, often
called morphing. Unlike motion tweening, shape tweening works only with
plain vector objects, usually ones that you create with the Macromedia
Flash drawing tools. You cannot shape tween a symbol instance, text, or a
group unless you break them apart by choosing Modify➪Break Apart.
To turn text into shapes, choose Modify➪Break Apart twice. The first time
only breaks apart the text into individual letters. The second time you
choose Modify➪Break Apart, you create shapes from the individual letters.
However, remember that you can have only one animated object on a layer.
You can break apart text once, and then choose Modify➪Distribute to
Layers to put each letter on a separate layer. If you want to shape tween the
letters, break apart each letter a second time.
Creating a simple shape tween
To shape tween a shape, follow these steps:

Book V
Chapter 5
Creating Animation
Creating Tweened Shape Animation
561
1. On a new layer, right-click the frame where you want the animation
to start and select Insert Keyframe.
2. Create the beginning shape.
3. Insert a keyframe where you want to end the animation.
4. With the second keyframe selected, create the ending shape.
You can create the end shape by erasing the first shape and drawing a
new one or by modifying the first shape.
5. If you want to change color, you can simply choose another color for
the ending shape from the Color box in the Properties panel.
6. If you want to change transparency, open the Color Mixer panel
(Window➪Design Panels ➪Color Mixer) and change the Alpha per-
centage in the Alpha text field.
You can also change the color in the Color Mixer.
7. Click between the keyframes or select the entire span of the tween.
8. Select Shape from the Tween drop-down list in the Properties panel.
9. From the lower section of the Properties panel, select Angular from
the Blend drop-down list if your tween shape has straight lines and
sharp corners. Select Distributive for more curvy shapes.
You may need to click the Collapse/Expand arrow at the lower-right
corner of the Properties panel to display the lower section of the
Properties panel.
10. To play the animation, click the first keyframe and press Enter.
Using shape hints for more control
When you create your first shape tween, you may find that Macromedia
Flash calculated the transformation differently than you imagined it. You can
give Macromedia Flash cues, called shape hints, that tell it which part of the
original shape moves where, as shown in Figure 5-6.
Figure 5-6:
Shape hints
show where
points
on your
beginning
shape will
end up.

Adding Basic Interactivity to Animation
562
To use shape hints, follow these steps:
1. Create a shape animation as described in the section, “Creating a
simple shape tween.”
2. Click the first keyframe of the animation.
3. Choose Modify➪Shape➪Add Shape Hint or press Ctrl+Shift+H.
A small red circle with the letter “a” inside it appears on the Stage.
4. Drag the shape hint to the desired area in your shape.
5. Click the ending keyframe of the animation.
You again see a small circle with the letter “a” inside it on the Stage.
6. Drag the shape hint to the area in your shape where you want the
beginning hint to move.
7. Repeat Steps 3 through 6 to place additional shape hints.
8. Press Enter to play the animation and check the results.
If you want, you can remove or hide existing shape hints:
✦To remove a shape hint, drag it off the Stage.
✦To display and hide shape hints, select the layer and keyframe with the
shape hints and choose View➪Show Shape Hints.
You may get better results if you place the hints counterclockwise, starting
from the upper-left corner of your shape.
Adding Basic Interactivity to Animation
You often need to control how your animation works. For example, you may
want some animation to loop or to stop at a certain point. You may also
want to enable viewers to control the animation. Buttons commonly allow
users to stop the animation (perhaps some introductory animation for your
Web site) or turn off the sound. You introduce interactivity and control by
using ActionScript, the Macromedia Flash programming language.
The following sections offer a few ideas for using ActionScript in animation.
We cover interactivity in detail in Book V, Chapter 9.
Go To
You don’t need to play your animation from beginning to end. You can add
ActionScript (often simply called actions) to control the playing of the

Book V
Chapter 5
Creating Animation
Working with Scenes
563
frames. The goto action tells the movie to go to a different frame. At that
point, you can tell the animation to stop or to play.
Say that you want your animation to play from Frames 1–24, but then you
want the last half to loop over and over again. On Frame 24, you can add a
goto action and tell Macromedia Flash to go to Frame 12 and play. The ani-
mation goes to Frame 24, and then loops back to Frame 12 again. In this situ-
ation, the first 11 frames play only once, but Frames 12 through 24 play over
and over in a loop.
In another situation, you may want animation to play from Frames 1–24 and
then go to Frame 50 and stop. You may be using Frame 50 to display a menu.
In this case, you use the goto and stop actions.
Stop
Sometimes, you just want to stop the animation. For example, movie clips
automatically loop. If you want them to play just once and then stop, you
add a stop action in the last frame. For any animation, you can add a stop
action at the end to make sure that everything stops at the same time.
Play
After you stop an animation, you may want to play it again. You can use the
play action to play a movie when certain conditions are met. If the condi-
tions are not met, the movie does not play (due to a stop action).
On (mouse event)
The on action is used for buttons, which are explained in Book V, Chapter 3.
To add interactivity, you specify what happens when the button is clicked or
released, when a mouse cursor passes over or off the button, or when a
mouse cursor is dragged over or off the button. For example, a common use
of the on action would be to specify that when the button is clicked, you go
to a different frame or URL, such as another page on the Web site.
Working with Scenes
A scene is a section of an animation. You can divide up your animation into
scenes, each with its own Timeline. The scenes play back in the order you
set. The purpose of creating a scene is to help you organize your animation.
By default, you work in Scene 1. The current scene name is displayed
beneath the Layer list. To create a new scene, choose Insert➪Scene.

Working with Scenes
564
To manage your scenes, choose Window➪Scene. The Scene panel opens, as
shown in Figure 5-7.
You can use the Scene panel to work with scenes in the following ways:
✦Change scene order: Drag a scene’s name in the Scene panel to a new
location to change the order of the scenes.
✦Rename a scene: Double-click a scene’s name, type a new name, and
press Enter to rename a scene.
✦Add a scene: Click the Add Scene button at the bottom of the Scene
panel to add a scene.
✦Delete a scene: Select a scene and click the Delete Scene button at the
bottom of the Scene panel to delete a scene.
✦Duplicate a scene: Select a scene and click the Duplicate Scene button
at the bottom of the Scene panel to create a copy of a scene.
✦View a scene: Select the scene in the Scene panel to view the scene.

Chapter 6: Adding Sound
and Video
In This Chapter
 Introducing sound and video formats
 Working with sounds
 Working with video clips
You can make the Web experience richer by adding sound and video to
your Web pages. Sounds can range from a simple clicking noise when a
user clicks a button to music and narration. You can also include video in
your Web site.
Exploring Sound and Video Formats
Both sound and video files come in many formats. Before you can use sound
or video, however, you need a file that Macromedia Flash MX 2004 can import.
Sound file formats
You can use the following sound file formats in Macromedia Flash:
✦AIFF: This is the standard sound format for Macintosh computers.
These files usually have filenames with the .aif or .ief extensions.
✦WAV: This is the standard format for Windows machines. These files
usually have filenames with a .wav extension.
✦MP3: This is a highly-compressed format that maintains high quality
sound.
If you have QuickTime 4 or higher installed on your computer, you can
import Sound Designer II, Sun AU, and System 7 or higher sounds.
A sound file has several properties that affect its quality and size. You can
often adjust these properties to reduce file size without noticeably affecting
quality. For sophisticated adjustments, you probably need a sound-editing
program, such as SoundForge. Here are the basic properties of a sound file:

Working with Sounds
566
✦Sample rate: The sample rate is the number of times in kilohertz (kHz)
that an audio signal is sampled when it’s recorded digitally. A higher
sample rate results in higher quality sound but also yields a larger file
size.
✦Bit rate: The bit rate is the number of bits (pieces of data) used for each
audio sample. Sixteen-bit sounds are clearer, but 8-bit sounds are
smaller and may be good enough for simple sounds, such as a button
click.
✦Channels: Channels are the number of streams of sound in a file and are
either mono or stereo. Mono may be just fine and uses half the amount
of data as stereo.
You can find a sound’s properties when you import the sound into Macro-
media Flash, as explained in the upcoming section, “Importing sounds.”
Video file formats
The type of video formats you can use depends on some other software that
supports their playback:
✦If you have QuickTime 4 or later installed: You can import AVI, MPEG
(MPG), MOV, and DV formats.
✦If you have DirectX 7 or later installed: You can import AVI, MPEG
(MPG), and WMV/ASF (Windows Media File) formats.
Because video files are usually very large, they are always compressed by
using a codec. The word codec stands for compression/decompression. The
same codec decompresses the video file when it is used. You need to have
the codec that was used for the video file on your computer in order to
import the video file. The same applies to the audio track in a video file.
Working with Sounds
Working with sounds in Macromedia Flash involves at least two steps —
importing the sound and placing it in a movie. You can also do basic sound
edits in Macromedia Flash.
Importing sounds
To import a sound, follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪Import➪Import to Library.
The Import dialog box appears.

Book V
Chapter 6
Adding Sound
and Video
Working with Sounds
567
2. Select the sound file you want to import and click Open.
The sound goes into the Library.
To see a sound’s properties, open the Library, right-click the sound and
choose Properties from the contextual menu that appears.
Placing a sound in a movie
After a sound is in the Library, you can place it in your movie. You need to
decide when it starts, when it ends, or whether you want to loop the sound.
To place a sound, follow these steps:
1. Create a new layer for the sound by choosing Insert➪Timeline➪
Layer.
2. Right-click the frame and choose Insert Keyframe from the contextual
menu.
This inserts a keyframe on the sound’s layer where you want the sound
to start.
3. Press Ctrl+L to open the Library or select Window➪Library.
Scroll down to the sound file you’re looking for in the Library.
4. Drag the sound to the Stage.
The sound extends to the next keyframe, if one exists.
5. To specify settings for the sound, open the Properties panel by choos-
ing Window➪Properties.
6. Expand the Properties panel, shown in Figure 6-1, using the Expand/
Collapse arrow in the lower-right corner.
7. From the Sound drop-down list, choose the sound for which you want
to specify settings.
All the sounds you have imported are listed.
Figure 6-1:
Specifying
sound
settings.

Working with Sounds
568
8. To create a special effect, select an effect from the Effect drop-down
list.
You have the following choices:
• None: No special effect (the default).
• Left channel: Plays the sound from only the left speaker.
• Right channel: Plays the sound from only the right speaker.
• Fade left to right: Starts playing from the left speaker and moves to
the right speaker.
• Fade right to left: Starts playing from the right speaker and moves
to the left speaker.
• Fade in: Starts playing softly and increases the volume.
• Fade out: Starts playing loudly and decreases the volume.
• Custom: If you edit the sound, as explained in the next section, your
sound has a custom effect.
9. Select a synchronization type from the Sync drop-down list.
You can choose from the following options:
• Event: Plays the sound from its first keyframe until it ends (even if
the movie stops), replays the sound whenever that keyframe plays,
and the entire sound downloads before it plays. This choice is ideal
for button sounds that you want to play whenever the button is
clicked. Event is the default synchronization type.
• Start: Plays the sound like the Event option, but if the keyframe is
replayed before the sound is finished, the Start option doesn’t replay
the sound.
• Stop: Stops playing the sound.
• Stream: Synchronizes the sound with the animation, shortening or
lengthening the animation to match the length of the sound.
Macromedia Flash may skip frames if necessary.
10. If you want to loop or repeat the sound, select either Loop or Repeat
from the drop-down list beside it.
If you select Loop, the movie will simply repeat over and over again. If
you select repeat, you’ll be asked to enter the number of repeats in the
field provided.
11. Press Enter to play the animation and hear the sound.
Press Ctrl+Enter to test the movie if you’re working on a complex 
animation.

Editing sounds
Macromedia Flash contains its own simple sound-editing tool. For example,
you can delete some of the beginning or end of the sound if you don’t need
it. You can also change the volume. To edit a sound, follow these steps:
1. Click a frame that contains a sound.
2. Open the Properties panel by choosing Window➪Properties.
If necessary, click the Collapse/Expand arrow at the lower-right corner
to expand the Properties panel fully.
3. Click the Edit button within the Properties panel.
The Edit Envelope dialog box, shown in Figure 6-2, appears. In this con-
text, envelope just means the entire snippet of music.
You can edit the sound as follows:
• Change the volume: Drag an envelope handle (see Figure 6-2) up to
increase volume or down to decrease volume. Click an envelope line
to add a handle so that you can change the volume at that location.
• Delete the beginning of the sound: Drag the Time In control to the
right.
• Delete the end of the sound: Scroll to the end of the sound and drag
the Time Out control (the ending control) to the left.
You can use the Zoom In and Zoom Out buttons (refer to Figure 6-2) to
change the magnification in the Edit Envelope dialog box. You can also use
the Frames and Seconds buttons to change the display between frames and
seconds.
Figure 6-2:
You can edit
sounds in
the Edit

Setting sound properties
You can control the properties of a sound to further compress it. If you need
to specify different properties for different sounds, set the properties when
you place the sound in your movie:
1. Open the Library by choosing Window➪Library or by pressing
Ctrl+L.
2. Double-click the sound icon next to the sound for which you want to
see the properties.
The Sound Properties dialog box, shown in Figure 6-3, appears.
The top part of the dialog box lists the sound’s name, original location,
and statistics. At the bottom of the dialog box, use the Compression
drop-down list to select the file format you want:
• Default: Leaves the sound unchanged.
• ADPCM: Enables you to convert stereo to mono and to choose a
sampling rate and bit rate. Used for short sounds.
• MP3: Enables you to convert stereo to mono and to choose a bit rate
and quality. MP3 is an efficient compression method and is used for
longer, more complex sounds, especially music.
• Raw: Enables you to convert stereo to mono and to choose the sam-
pling rate. Raw uses no compression.
• Speech: Enables you to choose a sampling rate. This option uses
compression specially designed for speech.
As you choose an option, you see the resulting statistics at the bottom
of the dialog box.

3. Click the Test button to hear the result of your choice.
You can also set sound properties for all sounds at once when you publish
your movie. (See Book V, Chapter 7.)
Working with Video Clips
A new feature of Macromedia Flash MX 2004 is the ability to embed video
clips in your Flash movie. A video clip can be live action or animation cre-
ated with an animation program that outputs a video file format. Note:
Macromedia Flash may not be able to handle very long video files. You also
have no direct control over the video frames.
To use a video, follow these steps:
1. Select a key frame already on your Timeline (or create a new
keyframe by right-clicking a frame and choosing Insert Keyframe
from the contextual menu that appears).
2. Choose File➪Import➪Import to Library.
The Import dialog box appears.
3. Choose the video file you want and click the Open button.
The Video Import Wizard appears, as shown in Figure 6-4.
Figure 6-4:
The Video

provides all
the steps
you need to
follow to get

your Flash
movie.

Working with Video Clips
572
4. Select either the Import the Entire Video or the Edit the Video First
option.
Most Windows video formats, such as AVI or WMV, are not editable
before import. QuickTime, however, is editable. If you select Edit the
Video First option, you’re presented with a number of options, such as
combining clips and editing them to include only the parts you want to
see. In either case, when you’re ready to move on, click the Next button.
5. Select a compression profile.
You can select from one of the five compression algorithms that
Macromedia Flash offers by selecting it from the drop-down list, or you
can create your own by selecting the Create Your Own Profile option.
6. To choose the frequency of keyframes in the video clip, drag the
Keyframe Interval slider.
A video keyframe is separate from a Timeline keyframe. A video
keyframe stores the entire image data as compared to the changes from
the previous frame that are stored in regular frames.
A keyframe interval of 0 adds a single keyframe at the beginning of the
video stream and no other keyframes.
7. Select the Synchronize Video to Macromedia Flash Document Frame
Rate option to match the video frame rate to the Flash movie frame
rate.
If your video seems to display poorly, try deselecting this option.
8. From the Number of Video Frames to Encode per Number of Flash
Frames drop-down list, select a ratio.
The default is 1:1, which plays one video frame for each Flash frame. A
ratio of 1:2 would play one video frame for every two Flash frames. A 1:2
or higher ratio reduces file size, but reduces smoothness of playback as
well.
9. Click OK.
If the video clip is longer than the span of keyframes into which you are
placing the video, a message displays, asking if you want to add enough
frames necessary to play the entire clip.
10. Click Yes to add the frames.

fter you finish creating your Flash document, you need to publish it in
SWF movie format. You then use HTML code to insert the SWF movie
in a Web page so that browsers can display the animation. In this chapter,
we explain how to get your animation onto your Web site.
Publishing Movies the Simple Way
If you don’t need to change any settings, you can immediately publish your

By default, Macromedia Flash MX 2004 creates two files: The SWF file and an
HTML file that contains the HTML code needed for your Web page. You can
also export your document to other formats by selecting the format you
want on the Formats tab. We discuss the HTML code and other export for-
mats in the “Generating HTML and Graphics” section, later in this chapter.
Macromedia Flash creates all these files by using the name of your Flash
document and tacking on various filename extensions. If you want to specify
the filenames, deselect the Use Default Names check box and enter your
own filenames in the text fields.
To post your movie on your Web site, you use the HTML code either by
itself or within another Web page. Then you upload both the Web page and
the SWF file as you would any other Web page and image.
Macromedia Flash has a lot more options for you to tweak. To set these
options, click the other tabs of the Publish Settings dialog box and select
the options you want before clicking the Publish button.
Click the Flash tab, shown in Figure 7-2, to see the options for creating the
SWF file. You can set the following options:
✦Version: Saves in previous version formats for backward compatibility.
✦Load Order: Controls the loading order of layers in your document for
the first frame (which usually takes the longest to display).
Changing the load order can affect how your ActionScript code functions.
✦ActionScript Version: Here you can select the version of ActionScript
you’d like to run in your movie. You can click the Settings button to
specify the classes to be exported if you select ActionScript 2.0 from the
drop-down list.
✦Generate Size Report: Creates a text file that details the size of the
frames of your movie, so that you can make adjustments if a movie is
loading slowly.
✦Protect from Import: Helps prevent the SWF file from being imported
into an FLA file that others could then modify.
Never trust that your SWF is completely safe. Tools to undo this option
are available on the Web.
✦Omit Trace Actions: Reduces file size by deleting trace actions if you
used them in your ActionScript to help you debug your code.

✦Optimize for Flash Player 6: This feature optimizes your movie for play-
back on the Flash Player 6.
✦Password: Enables you to enter a password for debugging so that those
without the password cannot debug your movie.
✦JPEG Quality: Sets the quality of bitmaps. Higher quality looks better,
but means a larger file size.
✦Audio Stream: Sets the audio compression for all stream sounds in the
movie, if you haven’t set individual settings in the Sound Properties
dialog box. Click the Set button to set the compression. See Book V,
Chapter 6 for more information on stream sounds.
✦Audio Event: Sets audio compression for all event sounds in the movie.
Click the Set button to set the compression.
✦Override Sound Settings: Overrides settings in the Sound Properties
dialog box and applies settings here to all sounds in your movie.

Optimizing Movies for Speed

Optimizing Movies for Speed
As you work, you should always design for fast display on a Web site. You
can’t control the speed of your viewers’ Internet connections or how fast
their computers’ processors are, but you can definitely control the size of
your movie file. Before you publish your document, you may want to look it
over from within Macromedia Flash and see how you can make it more effi-
cient. After you publish and test the movie on a Web page, you may find that
you need to make some adjustments for faster download. The following four
sections offer some tips for optimizing your movies for speedy display.
Simplifying graphics
You can simplify the graphics in your movie and greatly increase its speed.
Here are some pointers:
✦Use tweened animation: Tweened animation is faster than frame-by-
frame animation. (See Book V, Chapter 5.)
✦Don’t animate bitmaps: Macromedia Flash needs to store the location
of each pixel in a bitmap, and that greatly increases file size. In fact,
avoid bitmaps altogether as much as possible.
✦Turn everything into symbols: Even backgrounds should be symbols.
You can also put symbols inside of symbols. (See Book V, Chapter 3.)
✦Group objects: Groups also reduce file size. (See Book V, Chapter 2.)
✦Optimize curves: Optimizing curves reduces the number of lines in
your graphics. (See Book V, Chapter 2.)
✦Use solid lines: Avoid dashed and dotted lines. Especially avoid custom
lines. (See Book V, Chapter 2.)
✦Use the Pencil tool rather than the Brush tool: The Brush tool requires
your document to store more information. (See Book V, Chapter 2.)
✦Use the Web safe color palette: Avoid custom colors. (See Book V,
Chapter 2.)
✦Use solid fills rather than gradients as much as possible: Gradients are
more complex to calculate.
✦Avoid transparency: As much as possible, avoid using alpha values of
less than 100 percent.
Optimizing text
Text takes up more bytes in your file than vector graphics. Here are some
options for reducing the load:

Book V
Chapter 7
Publishing 
Movies
Optimizing Movies for Speed
577
✦Reduce the number of fonts: Use simpler fonts, fewer font styles (bold,
italic), and fewer fonts overall. Use device fonts (sans, serif, and type-
writer) if possible.
The three device fonts display correctly in any browser and on any
computer.
✦Put text into your HTML document: Not all text needs to be in your
Flash document. If you can put some of your text in HTML format, you’ll
get faster download times.
Minimizing the size of sound files
Sound and music can really hog up the download stream. (See Book V,
Chapter 6 for details about working with sounds.) You can use the following
techniques to minimize the size of sounds:
✦Compress sounds: Use the Sound Properties dialog box (right-click the
sound in the Library and choose Properties from the contextual menu)
to fine-tune settings for individual sounds or compress sounds using the
sound settings (Audio Stream and Audio Event) on the Flash tab of the
Publish Settings dialog box, described earlier in this chapter. Use the
MP3 format whenever possible.
✦Remove silent areas: Edit sounds to remove unnecessary beginnings
and endings by adjusting the Time In and Time Out controls.
✦Reuse sounds: You can reuse a sound with different in and out points or
loop different parts of the same sound.
✦Don’t loop streaming sound: It’s not necessary, and the browser contin-
ually downloads it.
Testing download time
Macromedia Flash can simulate various Internet connection speeds and give
you feedback on which frames may cause a delay in download time. Don’t
miss out on this excellent tool. If the results indicate delays, go back and
adjust your movie until everything displays quickly. You don’t want to lose
your Web site visitors because they get impatient while waiting for your Flash
movie to download! Follow these steps to test your movie’s download time:
1. Choose Control➪Test Movie.
2. From the menu bar of the new window, choose View➪Download
Settings and choose a download speed.
3. From the menu bar of the new window, choose View➪Bandwidth
Profiler.
The Bandwidth Profiler is shown in Figure 7-3.

578
4. Choose View➪Simulate Download to simulate playing the animation
over an Internet connection.
Watch for any jerkiness and listen for any breaks in the sound.
5. Choose View➪Streaming Graph to see all the frames that may cause
delays or View➪Frame by Frame Graph to see the size of each frame.
These are just two ways of viewing the information. You can use either
view. Click on any bar (which represents a frame) to see the information
for that frame. Frames that extend above the red horizontal line may
cause a delay in the display of the movie.
6. Choose File➪Close to close the movie testing tools.
A short delay in the first frame is often acceptable as Macromedia Flash
downloads all the information. After the first frame, you should try to avoid
any delays because they result in pauses or uneven animation.
Although the best solution is to minimize delays, another possible choice is
a preloader, a short animation that plays over and over while the main ani-
mation is loading. If you want your viewers to get to your movie quickly,
work to reduce file size rather than using a preloader. If the artistry and spe-
cial effects are primary, then use a preloader.
Generating HTML and Graphics
When you publish your Flash document, you also generate the HTML code
that you need to create a Web page that plays your animation. You can also
export your movie in several other graphic and animation formats.
Creating HTML code
You can use the HTML code that Macromedia Flash generates to create a
new Web page that contains nothing but your movie, or you can insert the

HTML code into an existing Web page that may contain many other compo-
nents. On the HTML tab of the Publish Settings dialog box, you can specify
the following settings:
✦Template: Specifies the content of the HTML file. The Flash Only (the
default) option includes only <OBJECT> and <EMBED> tags. Other tem-
plates add code to detect earlier Flash Players or offer other features.
To see what each template does and which formats you need to choose,
select the template and click the Info button.
✦Dimensions: Controls the size of the movie in the browser. The default
option, Match Movie, matches the width and height of your Stage. You
can also specify the size in pixels or by percent.
✦Playback: Paused at Start: Pauses the movie until your viewer clicks
a button (that you have coded to start the movie) or right-clicks and
chooses Play. By default, this option is off, so that the movie plays 
automatically.
✦Playback: Loop: Repeats the movie over and over. By default, this
option is on.
✦Playback: Display Menu: On by default, this option displays a contex-
tual menu if viewers right-click. The menu allows viewers to play, loop,
and print the movie. However, not all viewers know that this contextual
menu exists.
✦Playback: Device Font: Substitutes anti-aliased fonts (that look
smoother) for fonts not available on the user’s computer. This option is
not selected by default.
✦Quality: Sets the quality of playback. Choose one of the following:
• Low: Uses no anti-aliasing (smoothing).
• Auto low: Starts at low quality and switches to the highest quality
that the user’s computer (detected by the Macromedia Flash Player)
can handle.
• Auto high: Starts at high quality and switches to a lower quality if
the user’s computer (detected by the Macromedia Flash Player)
cannot handle high quality.
• Medium: Uses some anti-aliasing, but doesn’t smooth bitmaps.
• High: Uses anti-aliasing for everything except tweened bitmaps (the
default).
• Best: Uses anti-aliasing for text, unanimated bitmaps, and tweened
bitmaps.

Generating HTML and Graphics
580
✦Window Mode: Specifies how the movie’s window relates to the rest of
the page in Internet Explorer 4.0 and higher on the PC. Choose Window
(a separate window), Opaque (an opaque background), and Transpar-
ent (a transparent background).
✦HTML Alignment: Aligns the movie in the browser window. You can
choose Default (centered), Left, Right, Top, or Bottom.
✦Scale: Specifies how the movie is placed in its boundaries when you use
the Pixels or Percent option of the Dimensions setting and the width
and height are therefore different from the movie’s original size. The
choices are Default (Show All), No Border, Exact Fit, and No Scale.
✦Flash Alignment: Specifies how the movie fits in the movie window (not
the browser window). The Horizontal setting can be Left, Center, or
Right. The Vertical setting can be Top, Center, or Bottom.
✦Show Warning Message: Displays warning messages if there are prob-
lems during publishing.
Creating graphic files
You can create GIF, JPEG, and PNG graphic files from a frame of your Flash
movie. Each type of graphics file has its own options. By default, Macro-
media Flash creates the image from your first frame.
To add a label to a frame, click the frame and open the Properties panel
(Window➪Properties). Expand the Properties panel by using the Collapse/
Expand arrow at the bottom-right corner. Type the label name in the Frame
text field. You can name a frame anything you want. Certain names, such as
the #Static label, have specific meanings for how Macromedia Flash functions.
GIF files
GIF files have limited colors but allow transparency. Select the GIF check
box on the Formats tab of the Publish Settings dialog box. when you do that,
you’ll see a GIF tab appear. Then click the GIF tab, where you have the fol-
lowing settings:
✦Dimensions: Select the Match Movie option to match the size of the
Stage. To use a different size, deselect the Match Movie option and type
the new dimensions.
✦Playback: Select either the Static (a single image) or Animated (an ani-
mated GIF of the entire movie) option. If you select Animated, you can
choose to loop continuously or repeat a specified number of times.
✦Options: You have several options to choose from:

581
• Optimize Colors: Select the Optimize Colors option to remove
unused colors.
• Interlace: Select the Interlace option to load in increments of greater
resolution (starting from fuzzy).
• Smooth: Select the Smooth option to anti-alias the artwork.
• Dither Solids: Select the Dither Solids option to approximate colors
not available on the GIF color palette.
✦Transparent: Allows you to set transparency (alpha) of the background.
✦Dither: Dithering is the approximation of a color from a mixture of other
colors when the desired color is not available. This option defines the
type of dithering. You can choose Ordered dithering, which provides
good-quality dithering without much increase in file size, or you can
choose Diffusion dithering, which provides top-quality dithering for the
216 Web safe colors but makes for a larger file size.
✦Palette Type: Defines the GIF color palette. If you choose an adaptive
palette, a unique color palette is created for the GIF. You can then
choose the maximum number of colors. If you choose a custom palette,
click the ellipsis button and choose a palette file. To save a palette of
colors that you use in Macromedia Flash, choose Window➪Design
Panels➪Color Swatches, click the Options menu icon in the upper-right
corner of the Color Swatches panel, and choose Save Colors.
JPEG files
JPEG files allow for many colors but do not allow transparency. They decom-
press when downloaded, taking up more memory. Select the JPEG check box
on the Formats tab of the Publish Settings dialog box. Then click the JPEG
tab (it appears after you select the JPEG check box), where you have the fol-
lowing settings:
✦Dimensions: You can match the size of the Stage or specify another size.
✦Quality: Choose the quality. Higher quality means a better picture but a
larger file size.
✦Progressive: Displays the JPEG file in increments of greater resolution
(starting from fuzzy) as it downloads in a browser.
PNG files
PNG files offer many colors and transparency, too. Select the PNG check box
on the Formats tab of the Publish Settings dialog box. Then click the PNG
tab (it appears after you select the PNG check box), where you have the fol-
lowing settings:

✦Dimensions: You can match the size of the Stage or specify another size.
✦Bit Depth: Controls the number of colors the image can contain and the
availability of transparency (alpha). More colors — and adding trans-
parency — increase the file size.
✦Options: You have several options to choose from:
• Optimize Colors: Select the Optimize Colors option to remove
unused colors.
• Interlace: Select the Interlace option to load the PNG file in incre-
ments of greater resolution (starting from fuzzy).
• Smooth: Select the Smooth option to anti-alias the artwork.
• Dither Solids: Select the Dither Solids option to approximate colors
not available on the GIF color palette. Same as for GIF images
(explained previously).
✦Dither: If you choose an 8-bit depth, use the same Dither settings as for
GIF images. This option is not available for other bit depths.
✦Palette Type: If you choose an 8-bit depth, use the same Dither settings
as for GIF images.
✦Max Colors: Same as for GIF images.
✦Palette: Same as for GIF images.
✦Filter Options: Determines the method of compression (the method of
combining pixels in an image). Choose from the following options:
• None: No compression.
• Sub: Filters adjoining pixel bytes, going horizontally.
• Up: Filters vertically.
• Average: Uses both horizontal and vertical.
• Path: Creates an algorithm using the three nearest pixels to predict
the next pixel.
• Adaptive: Provides the most accurate colors.
Creating QuickTime movies
QuickTime is a video format that plays on the QuickTime player. To use
QuickTime movies, you need to have QuickTime 4, 5, or 6 installed.
The Macromedia Flash Player doesn’t always keep up with QuickTime ver-
sions. A movie that you create in Macromedia Flash may not work with the
latest version of QuickTime.

Select the QuickTime check box on the Formats tab of the Publish Settings
dialog box. Click the QuickTime tab that appears, where you have the fol-
lowing settings:
✦Dimensions: You can match the size of the Stage or specify another size.
✦Alpha: If you have combined a QuickTime movie with a Flash movie,
this option sets the transparency of the Flash track within the
QuickTime movie. A QuickTime movie can contain a separate layer with
the Flash movie. The Auto option makes the Flash track transparent
only if it is on top of other tracks. The Alpha-transparent option always
makes the Flash track transparent. The Copy option makes the Flash
track opaque, hiding all content behind it.
✦Layer: Specifies how the Flash track is layered with the QuickTime con-
tent. Choose from Auto (Flash track on top if Flash content appears in
front, otherwise on the bottom), Top (Flash track on top), and Bottom
(Flash track at the bottom).
✦Streaming Sound: Select the Use QuickTime Compression check box to
export sound to a QuickTime soundtrack. Click Setting to specify how
the sound is compressed.
✦Controller: Creates a control panel to play the movie. Choose None if
you have created your own controller or don’t want viewers to have any
control. The Standard option displays the QuickTime controller. The
QuickTime VR option offers special panoramic and 3D viewing features.
✦Playback: Select the Loop check box to repeat the movie, the Paused At
Start check box to let viewers use the Controller to start the movie, or
the Play Every Frame check box to disable skipping frames and sound
to maintain timing.
✦File: The Flatten (Make Self-Contained) option combines the Flash
movie with imported content into a QuickTime movie. If you don’t
select the Flatten check box, the QuickTime movie references the
Macromedia Flash SWF file.
Creating self-playing movies
Self-playing movies are called projectors. A projector doesn’t require a sepa-
rate Macromedia Flash Player and is ideal when you are putting a Flash movie
on a CD-ROM. To create a projector, select the Windows Projector or the
Macintosh Projector check box on the Formats tab of the Publish Settings
dialog box. Then click the Publish button. The result is a file with an .exe
extension (for PCs) or an .hqx extension (for Macs). The projector file is
larger than an SWF file, but users can download it from a Web site and play
it without needing the Flash Player.

Exporting movies and images
Export a movie or image, instead of publishing it, when you need to use it in
another application. For example, you can export a frame as a GIF file and
insert it into a PowerPoint presentation. If you already have the HTML code
and just want to update an SWF file, you can export instead of publish:
1. Select the frame you want to export, if you are exporting an image.
2. Choose File➪Export Image or File➪Export Movie.
3. Type a name for the image or movie.
4. From the Save as Type drop-down list, select a file type.
5. Click Save.
A dialog box may appear if the format you choose has settings that you can
specify. These settings are the same as you have when you publish a file and
are explained in the section, “Generating HTML and Graphics,” earlier in this
chapter. You can export the following file types:
✦Adobe Illustrator (.ai)
✦Encapsulated PostScript (.eps)
✦Drawing Exchange Format (.dxf)
✦Windows Bitmap (.bmp)
✦Metafile (.emf/.wmf)
✦FutureSplash Player (.spl)
✦Graphics Interchange File (.gif)
✦Joint Photographic Experts Group (.jpeg/.jpg)
✦QuickTime (.mov)
✦PICT Sequence (.pct)
✦Portable Network Graphic (.png)
✦Video for Windows (.avi)
✦Windows Audio (only) (.wav)

lash documents are fully programmable using the built-in language,
ActionScript. Before we go any further, let’s be clear: You don’t need to
be a programmer to use ActionScript. Nonprogrammers can do a lot with
ActionScript. However, if you are a programmer, you certainly have an
advantage. In this chapter, we explain how a nonprogrammer uses
ActionScript.
Exploring the Role of ActionScript
Although you can do many interactive tasks without ActionScript, including
some of those in the following list, ActionScript gives you the ability to con-
trol your movies. Here are some things you can do with ActionScript:
✦Create a button to take your viewers to another Web page.
✦Loop a movie clip through a small range of frames.
✦Let your viewers drag objects on your Web site to new locations. (An
example would be a site where viewers drag images of furniture onto a
floor plan to see if it fits.)
✦Create a preloader, a short animation that plays while a longer movie
loads.
✦Set the properties, such as location and size, of movie clip instances.
(See Book V, Chapter 3 for an explanation of movie clips and instances.)
✦Create an animated mask (a shape that hides everything on the Stage
except what is just behind the shape).
✦Play or stop animation.

Using Actions in Your Movies
586
In certain cases, you need to use ActionScript. For example, a button is use-
less without some ActionScript. You can create wonderful animation with no
ActionScript at all, but adding ActionScript opens many possibilities for inter-
activity on your Web site, and it’s easy to use after you get some practice.
Because ActionScript tells your movie what action to take, the code is often
called actions. Adding ActionScript is the same as adding actions.
ActionScript is very similar to JavaScript, a programming language used on
Web pages.
Using Actions in Your Movies
Macromedia Flash MX 2004 offers a wide variety of actions that you can use,
the basics of which we cover here. You can get more information several
ways:
✦Choose Help➪ActionScript Dictionary.
✦Take a tutorial by choosing Help➪Using Flash➪Tutorials➪Introduction
to ActionScript Tutorial.
✦Pick up a copy of Macromedia Flash MX ActionScript For Dummies, by
Doug Sahlin, published by Wiley Publishing, Inc.
To add actions, you use the Actions panel (Window➪Development Panels➪
Actions), which is shown in Figure 8-1 as it appears when you select a frame.

As part of the split of Macromedia Flash into two products, Macromedia
Flash MX 2004 and Macromedia Flash MX Professional 2004, the Actions
panel has been completely reworked. Even in the entry-level version of
Macromedia Flash, the Actions Panel has completely eliminated the visual
interface for ActionScript of previous versions in favor of a code-only view.
While this makes the products more similar, it actually makes the interface
vastly more confusing for the budding ActionScript user.
The Actions panel has the following features:
✦Title Bar Expand/Collapse arrow: Use this arrow at the top-left of the
panel to expand the Actions panel, as shown in Figure 8-1, and to col-
lapse the Actions panel so that you see only the title bar.
✦Actions list: Choose actions and other ActionScript components from
this list. Underneath the Actions list, you’ll see a status pane that
includes exactly where you are in your Flash document.
✦Script pane: Displays ActionScript.
✦Insert a target path: Click this button to open a dialog box where you
can choose from named instances in the drawing if you need to refer to
another object.
✦Options area: At the top right of the Actions panel are three buttons
that allow you to set various options in the panel. When clicked, the
book icon brings up the ActionScript Help in the Help panel. Click the
stethoscope icon (interesting choice!) to bring up a pop-up menu with
code debugging options. And finally, click the View Options button to
add line numbers, see the key commands for ActionScript commands in
the reference, and to invoke the word wrap feature.
Timeline Control actions
The first grouping of actions in the Actions panel, which you can open by
choosing Window➪Development Panels➪Actions, contains the Timeline
Control actions. In Macromedia Flash MX 2004, these actions are part of the
Global Functions suite of ActionScript functions. These actions control the
Timeline of a movie, and they are the most commonly used functions. You
can choose from the following actions:
✦gotoAndPlay: This action tells your movie to go to a different frame
and then continue to play at the new frame.
✦gotoAndStop: This action tells your movie to go to a different frame
and then stops the movie at the new frame.
✦nextFrame and prevFrame: This action will take you to the next or pre-
vious frame.

Using Actions in Your Movies
588
✦nextScene and prevScene: This action will take you to the next or
previous scene in the scene order.
✦play: This action tells a movie to start playing.
✦stop: This action stops a movie from playing.
✦stopAllSounds: This action stops any sounds from playing.
It’s important to note that all of these actions are case-sensitive. So, be sure
that you’ve got them input in the Script pane properly or your ActionScript
won’t work properly.
Browser/Network actions
The Browser/Network category contains actions that connect your movie to
the world outside it. Here’s a sample of some of the more common actions
in this category:
✦fscommand: This action is an advanced command that enables you to
control other applications. You can use this command to execute
JavaScript on the Web page.
✦getURL: This action creates a hyperlink to another Web page or Web site.
✦loadMovie: This action loads either a single SWF file or JPEG image.
✦unloadMovie: This action unloads a loaded movie.
Movie Clip Control actions
Movie Clip Control actions control movie clips, of course. Some of the more
commonly used actions are noted here:
✦duplicateMovieClip: This action makes a copy of a movie clip.
✦on: This action defines the mouse event that triggers the action. It is
used for buttons and is added automatically when you are adding
ActionScript to a button.
✦onClipEvent: This action specifies the event that triggers a movie clip
action. It is inserted automatically when you add an action to a movie
clip.
✦removeMovieClip: This action deletes a movie clip, usually one created
with the duplicateMovieClip action.
✦setProperty: This action sets various size, visibility, and position prop-
erties of a movie clip.
✦startDrag: This action makes a movie clip draggable on the browser
screen. You can add this action to a button inside a movie clip, so that
the movie clip responds to the mouse.

Book V
Chapter 8

589
✦stopDrag: This action stops a drag that was started with startDrag.
✦updateAfterEvent: This action updates the display of a movie clip
after a specified event, such as dragging.
Advanced actions
If you’re ready to do a little programming, you can use many more options.
For example, ActionScript contains a large number of built-in methods, which
modify symbol instances. ActionScript programmers create variables that
store values and use them later on in the script. You can create code that
executes only if and when certain conditions exist. For more information,
see Macromedia Flash’s ActionScript dictionary, which you can access by
choosing Help➪ActionScript Dictionary.
To help you understand what you’ve written, you can (and should) add
comments that explain what is going on. Comments are lines within the
ActionScript code that are ignored when the code is processed. To add a
comment, place two forward slashes (//) before the comment text.
Here are some basics about how to write ActionScript:
✦You can use operators such as + and or to calculate values.
✦You can use built-in functions to obtain information about objects
before you change them.
✦You can change certain properties of objects with setProperty, such as
• Alpha (transparency)
• Height
• Rotation
• Visibility (yes or no)
• Height and width
• X and Y location
• X and Y scale
Creating Frame Actions
You can add actions to three places: frames, buttons, and movie clips. When
you add actions to movie clips, you add it to the instance (copy) of the
movie clip symbol that you insert on the Stage. You can also insert actions
on the Timeline of movie clips.

Creating Frame Actions
590
Movie clips have their own Timeline and therefore their own set of frames.
If you add an action to a frame, the action is executed when the animation
reaches that frame. For example, if Frame 20 has an action to go to Frame 1,
when Frame 20 is loaded, the movie jumps to Frame 1. You can use frame
actions to load a movie clip at a certain frame, to stop a movie from running,
or to automatically send the user to another URL or another frame.
To add an action to a frame, follow these steps:
1. Create a new layer by right-clicking a layer and selecting Insert Layer
from the contextual menu.
A common name for this new layer would be Actions. (You can put
actions on existing layers, but we recommend placing actions on a spe-
cial layer so that you can easily find them.)
2. Click a keyframe on the new layer.
Because the action means a change occurs in that frame, you need a
keyframe. If necessary, insert a keyframe by right-clicking and choosing
Insert Keyframe from the contextual menu that appears.
3. If it is not open already, open the Actions panel by choosing
Window➪Development Panels➪Actions.
If the panel is open but collapsed, click the Expand/Collapse arrow on
the Actions panel’s title bar. (Refer to Figure 8-1. Notice that the title bar
of the Actions panel says Actions - Frame because you have clicked a
keyframe.)
See Book V, Chapter 1 for more on managing panels.
4. To choose an action, click a category (such as Global Functions) and a
subcategory (such as Timeline Control) from the upper-left pane of
the Actions panel, and then double-click the action you want (or drag
it to the Script pane).
If the action needs parameters to specify how it works, you can mouse
over the ActionScript on the Script pane and see what values the
ActionScript function can accept.
5. Type the required parameters in the parameter text fields or choose
them from the drop-down lists.
Each action requires different parameters. The appropriate parameters
for an action appear when the ActionScript is inserted and when you
highlight a line of ActionScript containing that action. For information

Book V
Chapter 8
Getting Interactive
with ActionScript
Creating Frame Actions
591
about the parameters required for any action, choose Help➪ActionScript
Dictionary and locate the action from the alphabetical list.
Some parameters display an Expression check box at the right. Select the
check box if you want the parameter to be considered as an expression,
which means that the ActionScript can calculate its value. Macromedia
Flash defines an expression as any combination of ActionScript symbols that
represent a value. Deselect the check box if you want the parameter to be
considered literally. (For example, the word “Hello” should be considered lit-
erally as a string of text.) Also, in many cases, you need to refer to another
object, such as a movie clip. Click the Insert a Target Path button to get a
list of appropriate objects.
To get the Actions panel out of the way, click the Collapse/Expand arrow on
its title bar. Press Ctrl+Enter to test your movie and see the result of your
ActionScript.
For a detailed list of actions, see the section, “Using Actions in Your Movies,”
earlier in this chapter.
For example, to add a gotoAndPlay action that sends the movie from the
last keyframe to Frame 20 and plays from there, follow these steps:
1. If Frame 20 is not a keyframe, right-click Frame 20 and choose Insert
Keyframe.
2. Click the last keyframe.
3. Open the Actions panel (choose Window➪Development Panels➪
Actions or click the Actions panel’s Expand/Collapse arrow).
4. On the upper-left pane of the Actions panel, click Actions, and then
click Timeline Control.
5. Double-click gotoAndPlay.
6. Input either the frame number or the name of the frame and scene
inside the parentheses.
If you include the frame number, you would just input the number. If you
include the scene, include the name of the scene followed by a comma,
followed by a space and the frame. The frame can be either a number
or, if the frame has a label, the label name. In this example, you would
type 20 between the parentheses.
7. Test the movie (press Ctrl+Enter) to check that it goes from the last
keyframe to Frame 20.

Creating Button Actions

Creating Button Actions
Buttons are your key to interactivity on your Web site. Buttons are espe-
cially attuned to the actions of the mouse. You can add ActionScript to a
button that executes an action when the user passes the mouse pointer
over the button or clicks it. For information on creating buttons, see Book V,
Chapter 3.
To add an action to a button, follow these steps:
1. Create the button, or if you created the button earlier, drag an
instance from the Library onto the Stage.
2. Select the button and open the Actions panel, if it is not already open,
by choosing Window➪Development Panels➪Actions.
If the panel is open but collapsed, click the Expand/Collapse arrow on
the Actions panel’s title bar. (Notice that the title bar of the Actions
panel says Actions - Button because you have selected a button.)
3. From the upper-left pane of the Actions panel, choose a category
(such as Global Functions) and subcategory (such as
Browser/Network), and then double-click an action (such as getURL).
The getURL action sends the user to the URL that you specify. You can
also drag the Action from the Action list to the Script pane using the
Selection tool.
4. If the action requires parameters, click the line of code that contains
the action itself and enter the necessary information in the parameter
text fields.
For more information about the parameters required by each action,
consult the ActionScript dictionary. Choose Help➪ActionScript
Dictionary.
To add an action to a button, you need to specify what type of mouse action
activates the ActionScript. Because the mouse option determines when the
action takes place (such as when the mouse button is released), it is called
an event. You can choose from the following button events:
✦Press: The action is executed when the viewer clicks the mouse button.
✦Release: The action is executed when the viewer releases the mouse
button. This is the most commonly used button event, because the
release of the mouse button means that the viewer has completed the
click.
✦Release Outside: The action is executed when the viewer releases the
mouse button outside the hit area.

Book V
Chapter 8
Getting Interactive
with ActionScript
Creating Button Actions
593
✦Key Press: The action is executed when the viewer presses the specified
key. Use this in addition to a mouse event to enable viewers to use the
keyboard instead of the mouse. A commonly used key is the Enter key.
✦Roll Over: The action is executed when the viewer passes the mouse
cursor over the button’s hit area, but doesn’t click.
✦Roll Out: The action is executed when the viewer leaves the hit area.
✦Drag Over: The viewer passes the mouse cursor over the button’s hit
area while holding down the mouse button.
✦Drag Out: The viewer leaves the hit area while holding down the mouse
button.
As an example, to add a getURL action to a button that functions when the
button is clicked, follow these steps:
1. Create the button.
For instructions, see Book V, Chapter 3.
2. From the Library (Window➪Library), drag an instance of the button
onto the Stage.
The button should have a border around it, indicating that it is selected.
3. Open the Actions panel (choose Window➪Development
Panels➪Actions or click the Actions panel’s Expand/Collapse arrow).
The Actions panel should say Button on its title bar. If it doesn’t, click
the button again.
4. From the upper-left pane of the Actions panel, click Actions, and then
click Browser/Network. Double-click getURL.
Your code in the Script pane should look like this:
getURL();
5. In the Script pane, enter the URL you’ve chosen inside quotes.
If the URL is within a Web site, it can be local, meaning that you don’t
need http://. If you want the button to send viewers to another site,
you need the full URL, including the http://.
6. To specify a target window for the URL, add it after the URL in the
getURL function as displayed in the Script pane.
These are the same options used with the <A> tag in HTML:
• _self: Opens the URL in the same window.
• _blank: Opens the URL in a new window.

Creating Button Actions
594
• _parent: When frames are used and one file is nested inside
another, opens the URL where the inner file was.
• _top: When frames are used, loads the URL in the topmost frame,
and the new page fills the entire window.
If you wanted to load a new window, and your URL is
www.somesite.com, the resulting ActionScript would look as follows:
getURL(“http://www.somesite.com”, “blank”);
Even though Flash doesn’t add the quotes in for you when you add the
getURL function to the Script pane, you will need quotes around both
the URL and the target.
7. Add the appropriate button code around the getURL function.
As noted previously, you have several button event options. To call the
URL when the button is pressed, you’d add the following code around
the getURL function:
on (Press) {
getURL(“http://www.somesite.com”, “_blank”);
}
8. Choose Control➪Test Movie and click the button to check if the
getURL action works.
If you used a local URL, the button won’t work unless the movie is pub-
lished and uploaded to the domain for that URL.

M
acromedia Flash MX 2004 is not limited to creating animation. You
can use Macromedia Flash to develop an entire interface, including
buttons, menus, forms, scroll bars, and more. Macromedia Flash includes a
set of interface elements called components that you can use to efficiently
add interfaces and interactivity to your Web site. In this chapter, we show
how you can use components and create forms with Macromedia Flash.
Macromedia Flash can create very innovative interfaces. As long as you
keep your Macromedia Flash interfaces user-friendly and easy to under-
stand, your viewers will appreciate the new look and feel. Scroll bars cre-
ated with Macromedia Flash are a lot cooler than the ones created in most
professional programs because you can customize how they look and func-
tion. Creating scroll bars and other interface elements for your Web page
with Macromedia Flash may actually be easier than with other, more com-
plex programming environments, although some of these techniques require
a bit of ActionScript programming to make them fully functional.
Components are actually movie clip symbols that contain a set of defined
parameters and properties. (For an explanation of movie clip symbols, see
Book V, Chapter 3.) You can specify the values of these parameters and
properties when you create your Flash document. Using these components
ensures that your interface items work together and in a similar manner.
Because of the programming that has been done in advance to create the
parameters and properties, you need to do less programming for each Flash
document you create.
You can customize the appearance of components to match the rest of your
Web site’s style. If you know some ActionScript, you can even create your
own components, and you can find components that Flash developers have
created on Flash resource Web sites.

Adding Components
596
Adding Components
Components can be as simple as a check box or as complex as an entire
graphical user interface. The following list represents a majority of the com-
ponents included in Macromedia Flash MX 2004:
✦Radio buttons: Radio buttons are small round buttons. Users can select
one choice from several options.
✦Check boxes: Users can select or deselect each check box.
✦Push buttons: Clicking a button makes something happen, like a button
symbol in Macromedia Flash. (See Book V, Chapter 3 for more informa-
tion on working with buttons.)
✦Combo boxes: Combo boxes provide drop-down lists.
✦List boxes: List boxes enable you to offer users a scrolling list of
choices.
✦Scroll panes: Scroll panes enable you to create scrollable windows for
movie clips.
✦Label: A label is a simple one-line text descriptor that accompanies a
field.
✦Loader: A loader loads a movie or a graphic file into memory.
✦ProgressBar: This handy component will show your viewers the
progress of a file being loaded.
✦TextArea: A multiline text area that can accept text inputs.
✦TextInput: Unlike the multiline text area, the TextInput accepts only a
single line of text.
✦Numeric Stepper: This handy component is great for drop-down-like
lists. Use it to make lists of numbers that can be incremented or decre-
mented depending on the keystroke.
✦Window: The Window component creates a window within your Flash
movie. This window can have a specific size, as well as header text and
even a Close button.
The procedure for working with a component is similar for all the compo-
nents. However, individual items vary. The general procedure is as follows:
1. Open the Components panel by choosing Window➪Components.
The Components panel is shown in Figure 9-1.
2. Drag one of the components onto the Stage.

Book V

3. With the component still selected, open the Properties panel, if it
isn’t open already, by choosing Window➪Properties.
If the Properties panel is open but collapsed, click the Expand/Collapse
arrow on its title bar.
4. Click the Parameters tab.
The Properties panel with the Parameters tab displayed is shown in
Figure 9-2.

598
5. In the Instance Name text field of the Properties panel, type an
instance name.
Remember that an instance is a single iteration of a symbol. By naming
each instance of the component, you can refer to it in your ActionScript.
6. Set the parameters for the component in the Properties panel by
clicking each parameter and entering the value in the field to its
right.
Repeat this procedure with all the components. The individual requirements
of the components are listed in the next several sections.
Use the Align panel, which is accessed by choosing Window➪Align, to line
up and evenly distribute a series of components, such as radio buttons or
check boxes.
You can resize components using the Free Transform tool, but they are not
all infinitely flexible. For example, you can change the width of a check box,
but not its height.
Check boxes
The CheckBox component allows users to select one or more choices from a
list. Each item on the list has a small box next to it that has a check inside
when the user clicks the box. The CheckBox component has the following
parameters:
✦Label: The Label parameter determines the text that is attached to the
component.
✦LabelPlacement: The LabelPlacement parameter places the text relative
to the rest of the component. You can choose Left or Right.
✦Selected: This parameter, when set to True, will show that your check
box is already selected when the page is first viewed.
Radio buttons
Radio buttons are like check boxes, except that users can only select one
at a time in any group of radio buttons. When a radio button is selected, it
has a dot inside its circle. The RadioButton component has the following
parameters:
✦Label: The Label parameter determines the text that is attached to the
component.
✦Selected: The Initial State parameter determines if a radio button is ini-
tially selected.

Book V
Chapter 9

599
✦Group Name: Say that you want to poll your users to see if they like to
swim and if they like to run. You want a Yes or a No for each. To create
such independent groups of radio buttons, enter a Group Name parame-
ter. Users can select one radio button in each group. For example, if you
have four radio buttons, you can put two into a group named Swim and
two into a group named Run. You can then label buttons Yes and No in
each group and ask users “Do you like to swim?” for the buttons in the
Swim group and “Do you like to run?” for the buttons in the Run group.
Users can then answer Yes or No to each question.
✦Data: Use the Data parameter to store data related to that button. For
example, if you want to know if a user selected the radio button named
Yes, you can put Yes in the Data field and use ActionScript to execute an
action (perhaps go to a specific Web page) if a user selected the Yes
radio button.
✦LabelPlacement: The LabelPlacement parameter places the text relative
to the rest of the component.
Push buttons
Push buttons are very similar to the buttons you create in Macromedia
Flash. The main reason to use a push button component would be to create
a consistent look with other components. However, the included parameters
may make them quicker to use and require less code. They have a Label
parameter that places text on the button and a click handler that uses a
function you write to specify what happens when a user clicks the button.
Combo boxes
A combo box is a menu list of items with a scroll bar to its right. Users can
scroll through the list of items and choose one, as shown in Figure 9-3.
Like radio buttons, combo boxes have Change Handler and Data parameters.
You add the labels for the list items in the Values dialog box as follows:
1. With the combo box selected, open the Properties panel, if it isn’t
open already, by choosing Window➪Properties; or click the
Expand/Collapse arrow on the Properties panel’s title bar.
Figure 9-3:
A combo
box is a
scrollable
list.

Adding Components
600
2. Click the Label row in the Parameter list, and then click the right side
of the row to open the Values dialog box.
The Values dialog box is shown in Figure 9-4.
3. To add a new list item, click the plus (+) sign and type the label.
You can click any label to edit it.
4. When you’re done, click OK.
The Editable parameter in the Parameter list specifies if the combo box is
editable. If this parameter is set to true, users can enter text to search for a
matching item. If it is set to false, users can only select an item.
The Row Count parameter in the Parameter list determines how many items
must be in the combo box before the scroll bar is displayed. The default is
eight items.
List boxes
A list box is like a combo box, except that (unlike a combo box) it can’t be
edited by the user, and you can allow users to select multiple items. To
allow this, set the Select Multiple parameter to true. You add the labels as
described in the section, “Combo boxes.”
Scroll panes
Scroll panes are rather unusual. They allow you to put movie clips (and only
movie clips) inside a scrollable pane. The advantage is to display large movies
or images without taking up a lot of space, as shown in Figure 9-5. No pro-
gramming is necessary. The movie clip must be in the Library, but it doesn’t
need to be on the Stage.
Figure 9-4:

dialog box

You can load JPG images into a scroll pane using ActionScript.
You also need to give the movie clip the Export for ActionScript option in
the Linkage Properties dialog box:
1. Open the Library by choosing Window➪Library, and then right-click
the movie clip and choose Linkage from the contextual menu.
The Linkage Properties dialog box opens.
2. In the Identifier text field, enter a linkage name for the movie clip.
Usually, the linkage name is the name of the movie clip.
3. Select the Export for ActionScript option. The Export in First Frame
option should also be selected.
4. Click OK.
Select the scroll pane and display the Properties panel. The ScrollPane com-
ponent has the following parameters:
✦Scroll Content: In the contentpath area, enter the linkage name of the
movie clip.
✦Horizontal Scroll: Using the three available parameters — hlinescroll-
size, hpagescrollsize, and hscrollpolicy — you can set the horizontal
scroll options. Use hscrollpolicy to turn horizontal scrolling on and off
and then use hlinescrollsize and hpagescrollsize to set the amount of
movement for the horizontal line and for the pane overall.
✦Vertical Scroll: Using the three available parameters — vlinescrollsize,
vpagescrollsize, and vscrollpolicy — you can set the vertical scroll
options. Use vscrollpolicy to turn vertical scrolling on and off and then
use vlinescrollsize and vpagescrollsize to set the amount of movement
for the vertical line and for the pane overall.
Figure 9-5:

you to

Adding Components
602
✦Drag Content: Set the ScrollDrag parameter to true to allow users to
drag the movie clip (pan it) to see the hidden portion without using the
scroll bars. (The default is false.)
Label
The Label component is perhaps the simplest of the components, in that it
is not dynamic in any way. It’s is simply a label for another form element.
That said, there are some settings that can be applied to a label. You can
align the text within the label by selecting an autoSize option. You can also
specify whether the label will be HTML text or not by selecting true or
false from the HTML option.
Loader
The Loader component allows you to load an SWF movie or a JPEG within a
Flash movie, effectively allowing you to play a movie within a movie. There
are only a few options that you can specify for this component:
✦Set autoload to true to let Flash load the movie for you in the keyframe
the movie begins in.
✦Provide a path to the SWF or JPEG file to be loaded using the
contentPath field.
✦Allow the movie to be scaled up or down by setting the scaleContent
property to true.
When you render the movie, Flash renders not only your movie, but the one
you’ve pointed to with the Loader component.
TextArea
The TextArea component creates, as you might expect, a text area on the
screen. Four simple options apply to this component. To take advantage of
this component, simply drag an instance of it from the Components panel
onto the Stage. Here’s what you can specify using parameters in the
Properties panel:
✦Make the text box editable (meaning you can type in it onscreen) by
selecting true from the Editable property field.
✦If you want the box to be in HTML format, select true from the HTML
property field. For ease of use, you’ll probably want to keep this set to
false.
✦If you want the field to be prefilled with text, input some text in the Text
property field.

Book V
Chapter 9

with Components
and Forms

603
✦Finally, if you want to use word wrap, be sure to select true in the
wordWrap property field.
TextInput
Much like the TextArea component, the TextInput component allows view-
ers to input text on the screen. Again, you add it to your document by drag-
ging an instance of it from the Components panel onto the Stage. In the
Properties panel, you can set the following parameters:
✦Make the text box editable (meaning you can type in it onscreen) by
selecting true from the Editable property field.
✦If you want the text field to be a password field, meaning only ****
shows up instead of characters, select true from the Password prop-
erty field. The default value is true.
✦If you want the field to be prefilled with text, input some text in the Text
property field.
NumericStepper
The NumericStepper can be a handy component when you have lists that
have incremental numeric values in them. Essentially, this component cre-
ates a list that can be cycled either up or down by using arrows. To use a
NumericStepper, simply drag it from the Components panel onto the Stage.
There, you can specify the following through the Properties panel:
✦To set the maximum value of the NumericStepper, input an integer in
the Maximum property field.
✦To set the minimum value of the NumericStepper, input an integer in the
Minimum property field.
✦The StepSize determines how big the increments are from step to step.
Again, input an integer here.
✦In the Value field property, input the initial value of the NumericStepper.
Window
Another interesting tool for adding some cool interactivity to your interface
is the Window component. This component adds a window to your Flash
movie. This can be useful if you’re zooming in or loading a picture in your
movie. You create a window by dragging it from the Components panel onto
the Stage. Then, you can specify the following:
✦If you want the window to be able to be closed, select true from the
CloseButton property field.

Creating Forms with Macromedia Flash
604
✦To load a picture into the window, provide a path to the image in the
contentPath property field.
✦If you’d like the window to have a text title, enter it in the Title property
field.
Setting component properties
You can set the color and text properties of a component using Action-
Script. You can also globally set properties of all the components in your
movie. Finally, you can create skins, graphic elements that affect how com-
ponents look. These methods are beyond the scope of this book. For more
information, see Flash Help.
Creating Forms with Macromedia Flash
You can create forms that users can complete online. You can capture the
information that users input into the forms and either use it elsewhere on
your site or send it to a server and place it in a database. Forms are a great
way to collect data about your users.
Collecting data within a Flash movie
You can collect data within a Flash movie to personalize the site. For exam-
ple, if a user enters a name (Joe) and favorite book genre (science fiction),
you can send the user to a page (or Flash frame) that incorporates the
user’s input, such as a page with the message shown in Figure 9-6.
Figure 9-6:

Creating Forms with Macromedia Flash
605
Creating this type of form requires some ActionScript. In general, advanced
ActionScript is not covered in this book, but here we give you the Action-
Script needed to accomplish this form.
To create this form, start a new movie and follow these steps:
1. Use the Text tool to create the labels (such as First Name and Favorite
Book Genre) on a separate layer, using the default static text.
You set the type of text in the Text Type drop-down list of the Properties
panel.
2. Next to each text label you just entered, create a new text field by
dragging the TextInput component from the Component panel.
3. For each text field, choose an instance name and enter it in the
Instance Name text field of the Properties panel.
We use the instance names firstname and favorite; these names are
used later in the ActionScript.
4. Use the Components panel to drag a push button onto the Stage.
5. In the Properties panel, type a label for the button, such as Done, and
change the Click Handler to Done.
The Click Handler, Done, is used in the ActionScript as a function to tell
Macromedia Flash what to do when the button is clicked. Your screen
should be similar to the top image in Figure 9-6.
6. Insert a new keyframe in Frame 2 of all the layers.
7. On the text layer of Frame 2, rearrange the text fields, as in the
bottom image of Figure 9-6.
These text fields should have the same instance names as they did in
Frame 1.
8. Select each of the text fields with instance names and change their
text type to Dynamic from the Text Type drop-down list of the
Properties panel.
Dynamic text comes from another location and is dynamically placed
into the SWF file when viewed. In this case, viewers input text in Frame
1 and the text they input is inserted into the dynamic text fields in
Frame 2.
9. Open the Actions panel by selecting Window➪Development
Panels➪Actions or by simply pressing the F9 key.
10. Add a new layer and name it Actions.

Creating Forms with Macromedia Flash
606
11. Click Frame 1 of the Actions layer and type the following in the Script
pane of the Actions panel:
stop();
this.firstname.text = “”;
this.favorite.text = “”;
function done() {
_global.myName = this.firstname.text;
_global.myFave = this.favorite.text;
gotoAndStop(2);
};
This ActionScript stops the animation on Frame 1 so that nothing hap-
pens until the viewer clicks Done. The next two lines reference the text
fields on the current Timeline (using “this”) to empty the two text fields
in case they already contain text. The function, Done, creates two vari-
ables, myName and myFave and sets them equal to the text in the first-
name and favorite input text fields. These variables are global so you
can use them again in Frame 2. Finally, the ActionScript moves the play-
head to Frame 2 and stops there.
12. Click Frame 2 of the Actions layer and type the following in the Script
pane of the Actions panel:
stop();
this.firstname.text = myName;
this.favorite.text = myFave;
This code stops the animation and sets the two dynamic text fields in
Frame 2 to the global variables you created in Frame 1. As a result, the
text that viewers input in Frame 1 appears here in Frame 2.
13. Choose Control➪Test Movie to see how the form works.
14. Fill in the form and click the Done button.
As you can see, although this form requires some ActionScript, it doesn’t
require very much. You can modify this ActionScript for your own needs.
The form created in this example is very simple. You can add many other
features, such as a Thank You page and form validation.
Posting form data
In the example in Figure 9-6, you may have wondered how you would know
to send the user the list of books. In order to accomplish this task, you need
to post the data from the form to a Web server. You also post data when you
want to collect visitors’ names, e-mail addresses, and so on, in order to
create a database of visitors.

Book V
Chapter 9
Creating Interfaces
with Components
and Forms
Creating Forms with Macromedia Flash
607
Posting form data is complex because you need a script (often a CGI script,
but there are several kinds) on the server to manage the data. The script
sets the requirement for the format of the data you send.
As with HTML forms, you specify a method of sending the information (get or
post are the only two options) and a URL. You can use the loadVariables
function to load variables to a CGI script. Here is an example:
loadVariables(“http://www.website.com/cgi-bin/scriptname.cgi”, “”, “POST”)
For more information, choose Help➪ActionScript Dictionary and look up the
loadVariables or loadVars functions.

A
ll the Macromedia Studio MX 2004 products covered in this book are
extremely useful for creating Web sites. If you are responsible for an
entire site — content, art, interface, and server-side programming — you
can bring the capabilities of the entire Macromedia Studio suite to bear on
your site.
The integrated interface means that the programs look and work similarly.
For example, the Properties panel basically serves the same purpose in
Fireworks MX 2004, Dreamweaver MX 2004, FreeHand MX, and Macromedia
Flash MX 2004.
In addition to similar interfaces, the programs also share common tool
icons. When you look for the Pen tool in Macromedia Flash, it looks the
same as the Pen tool in FreeHand and Fireworks. Nope, sorry, you won’t find
a Pen tool in Dreamweaver, it’s only got WYSIWYG (What You See Is What
You Get) tools for inserting graphic objects.
Integrating Macromedia Flash with Fireworks
Macromedia Fireworks is a full-featured Web graphics program. Its native
format is PNG, which is a bitmap file format. Fireworks can also work with
vector images. You can export Fireworks vector and bitmap images to
Macromedia Flash’s SWF movie format and then import them into
Macromedia Flash.

Integrating Macromedia Flash with Fireworks
610
You can also use the quick export feature to copy an object from Fireworks
to the system Clipboard, and then paste it into Macromedia Flash, or you
can export selected objects as SWF files. SWF files are generically referred to
as Flash movies. You activate the Quick Export feature by clicking the Quick
Export icon in the upper-right corner of the Fireworks Document window.
Importing a Fireworks PNG into Macromedia Flash
You can import both PNG files and the SWF files created in Fireworks into
Macromedia Flash by choosing File➪Import➪Import to Stage. When you
import a Fireworks PNG file into a Flash document, you have a tremendous
amount of latitude. You can choose to import the file as a movie clip and
retain layers, maintain paths as editable objects, and maintain text as
editable. Additionally, you can decide to flatten the PNG file into a single
bitmap.
If you import a graphic from Fireworks, you can start the editing process
from within Macromedia Flash. Select the graphic and click Edit in the
Properties panel (Window➪Properties). Macromedia Flash opens Fireworks,
where you can edit the image. In fact, there’s even this spiffy Editing from
Flash icon, in case you go on an extended break and when you return, you
forget what you were doing.
If you import the PNG file into Macromedia Flash and flatten it to a single
bitmap, when you edit the file from within Macromedia Flash, Fireworks
opens the original PNG file, and you can then edit every object to your
heart’s content. When you’re done editing, click the Done button and
Fireworks updates the image in Macromedia Flash. It’s known as roundtrip
editing. Now is that cool or what? Figure 10-1 shows a PNG file being edited
in Fireworks.
Some software is horribly invasive. If you’ve installed other software after
you installed the Macromedia Studio suite, this software may declare itself
as the default editor for PNG files. If this happens, you may have to use your
operating system to change the associated program for PNG files to
Fireworks, or reinstall the Macromedia Studio suite. If this is not feasible,
you’ll have to choose the Edit With option in Macromedia Flash and navi-
gate to the Fireworks.exe file.
As with other Macromedia products, the interface for Fireworks is very simi-
lar to the one you know in Macromedia Flash. So when you are roundtrip
editing, it’s not like you have to learn a new toolset or anything. You have
similar tools, similar panels, and the familiar Properties panel, for example.
The similar interface makes it easy to switch between programs without get-
ting confused.

Cutting and pasting between Macromedia
Flash and Fireworks
Another option is to cut and paste between Macromedia Flash and
Fireworks. If you’re creating a graphic symbol in Macromedia Flash and it’s
just not working out, you can use the graphic tools in Fireworks to smooth
out the lumps in your graphic by following these steps:
1. Choose Edit➪Cut.
Macromedia Flash cuts the object to your system Clipboard.
2. Launch Fireworks.
3. Choose File➪New.
Fireworks is so smart, it knows how big the object you cut from
Macromedia Flash is, and the document is just the right size.
4. Choose Edit➪Paste.
Fireworks pastes the object into the new document.
5. Edit the object in Fireworks.
You can use the Fireworks editing tools to modify the object you cut
from Macromedia Flash, add objects, and even add layers. However,
Figure 10-1:
Roundtrip
editing:
From Flash
to Fireworks
and back to
Flash.

Integrating Macromedia Flash with Dreamweaver
612
make sure you’ve got everything where you want it, because when you
select everything in Fireworks and then cut it and paste it back into
Macromedia Flash, the objects you added are flattened and cannot be
edited. The better solution is to follow Step 6 onward.
6. After you’ve finished editing in Fireworks, choose File➪Save.
The Save dialog box opens.
7. Enter a name for the file and navigate to the folder where you want to
save the file.
Fireworks saves the file in its native PNG format.
8. Exit Fireworks.
9. In Macromedia Flash, choose File➪Import.
The Import dialog box appears.
10. Select the file you just saved in Fireworks and click the Open button.
The Fireworks PNG Import Settings dialog box opens.
11. Choose the settings that best suit the Flash document you’re
working on.
If you want the ability to edit individual objects from the Fireworks file
in Macromedia Flash, make sure you don’t flatten the image. Import the
file as a movie clip and retain layers. If you were editing a symbol when
you cut the object from Macromedia Flash, select the Import into New
Layer in Current Scene option, and Macromedia Flash imports the PNG
file into the symbol you’re editing and retains each object from the
Fireworks PNG file as individual objects. You can now move individual
objects as needed, or create additional layers for the objects.
Integrating Macromedia Flash with Dreamweaver
The Dreamweaver interface is also similar to the Macromedia Flash interface,
with bunches of panels — including the ever-present Properties panel. You
can use Dreamweaver to create HTML code that holds your SWF files. It’s easy
to insert SWF files into Dreamweaver Web pages — just click the Flash icon on
the Common or Media categories of the Insert bar. You can also use
Dreamweaver to generate Flash buttons for use in HTML and CFML pages.
You can open, create, edit, and optimize Macromedia Flash files directly
from Dreamweaver. Finally, Dreamweaver now supports ActionScript edit-
ing. You can create server-side ActionScript in Dreamweaver and save a docu-
ment as a Macromedia Flash AS (ActionScript), ASR (ActionScript Remote),
or ASC (ActionScript Communication) file. The latter two options will only
work if you’re using Macromedia Flash MX Professional 2004.

Integrating Macromedia Flash with FreeHand
613
When you have a Macromedia Flash file in a Dreamweaver document and it’s
not up to snuff, you don’t have to exit Dreamweaver and reopen the original
FLA file, edit it, and then publish the file again. That would be way too much
work. In fact, we’re exhausted from just typing the last few sentences.
Fortunately, there’s a much simpler way. When you’re working on a
Dreamweaver HTML file that has an SWF movie embedded within it, you can
edit the Macromedia Flash file by following these steps:
1. Select the Macromedia Flash file in the Dreamweaver HTML 
document.
It’s the gray rectangle with an F emblazed on it. Note that you must be
working in Design or Code and Design (Split) view to do this.
2. Open the Properties panel.
For more information on the Dreamweaver Properties panel, see Book II,
Chapter 1.
3. Click the Edit button.
Dreamweaver launches Macromedia Flash, and the Locate Macromedia
Flash Document File dialog box appears.
4. Navigate to the folder where the native FLA file that you published
the SWF movie from is stored.
5. Select the appropriate file and click the Open button.
The native FLA file that you published the Flash movie as opens in
Macromedia Flash, and lo and behold, an icon that says Editing from
Dreamweaver appears.
6. Edit the file in Macromedia Flash as needed.
7. After editing the file, click the Done button.
This publishes the movie again and updates the file in Dreamweaver.
Before exiting, you may want to choose Control➪Test Movie to make
sure all is in order.
That’s roundtrip editing from Dreamweaver to Macromedia Flash. Too cool.
Integrating Macromedia Flash with FreeHand
Although at one time FreeHand was used mostly to create graphics for
printed media, such as magazines, it now has many features that are very
valuable for Web site use. FreeHand can create complex vector graphics
beyond anything you can create with Macromedia Flash. You can easily
import FreeHand graphics into Macromedia Flash by choosing File➪Import.

Integrating Macromedia Flash with FreeHand
614
When you import FreeHand graphics, you have a great deal of control over
how graphics appear in Macromedia Flash. You can do the following:
✦Assign pages of FreeHand documents to Macromedia Flash scenes or
keyframes.
✦Assign FreeHand layers to Macromedia Flash layers or keyframes, or
choose to import the entire FreeHand graphic as one layer (flattened).
✦Convert lens fills (for example, Magnify and Transparency) to
Macromedia Flash equivalents.
✦Import symbols from the FreeHand Library directly into your
Macromedia Flash Library.
You can use the Flash Navigation panel in FreeHand to test SWF files before
you export them to Macromedia Flash. FreeHand has an anti-alias display
mode that uses Macromedia Flash’s anti-alias feature to show you how your
FreeHand artwork will look in Macromedia Flash. You can apply hyperlinks
and Flash actions to graphics and text from within FreeHand.
FreeHand’s animation feature means that you can create animations
in FreeHand and use them in Macromedia Flash. This enables you to
use the FreeHand vector drawing tools to create a character, bring it to life
in FreeHand, and then export it as a Flash 4 or Flash 5 SWF file. After all,
vector illustrations are FreeHand’s claim to fame.
You can export FreeHand documents as SWF files. Furthermore, you can
view FreeHand documents as temporary SWF files, a process similar to
choosing Control➪Test Movie in Macromedia Flash. FreeHand opens a
Macromedia Flash Player window, and you can see how your FreeHand doc-
ument will look as an SWF file.
When you create files in FreeHand with the intention of using them in Flash
documents, make sure you use the RGB color model. (See Book IV, Chapter 6
for more about color management in FreeHand.) FreeHand files created with
the CMYK color model are converted to RGB when you import them into
Macromedia Flash. Macromedia Flash generally does a pretty good job of
making the transformation, but if you’re a stickler for detail and you want
what you see in FreeHand to be what you get in Macromedia Flash, stick
with the RGB color model when choosing colors for fills and strokes.
In spite of the fact that FreeHand and Macromedia Flash are distant cousins,
if you try to copy an object from Macromedia Flash with the hope of pasting
it into FreeHand for some hands-on editing, you can paste the file just fine,
but all you can edit is the stroke of the object you created in Macromedia
Flash. The fill acts just like a bitmap and refuses to yield to the FreeHand
editing tools.

Integrating Macromedia Flash with ColdFusion

Integrating Macromedia Flash with ColdFusion
When you need to coordinate Flash applications with server-side
ActionScript code, you use ColdFusion. ColdFusion supports server-side
ActionScript that you can use to create your Macromedia Flash Remoting
applications, making it easier to program both sides of the equation 
(server-side and client-side) in one programming language. Server-side
ActionScript is a document stored in a directory at the Web server, as
opposed to ActionScript in the Flash movie. These features are only avail-
able to Web developers who are using Macromedia Flash MX Professional
2004. Macromedia Studio, by default, does not include this version of
Macromedia Flash.
Another plus when you use the Macromedia Studio suite is the fact that you
can use ColdFusion as a testing server. When you start creating server-side
ActionScript in Dreamweaver that dovetails with an application you’re creat-
ing in Macromedia Flash, you don’t have to upload everything to the Web
server to test your application. You can use ColdFusion as a local server and
test the Flash application (which, as you may remember, is embedded in an
HTML file, the pearl in Dreamweaver’s oyster), by testing the HTML docu-
ment in Dreamweaver to make sure all is well.
You can also connect databases with Flash movies to provide personalized
or continually updated information to viewers and add special features,
such as text search and dynamic charting, to Flash movies.
Integrating Macromedia Flash with other
Macromedia products
Macromedia also has two other Flash-related
products that you should know about —
Macromedia Flash Communication Server 
MX and Macromedia Flash Remoting MX.
These products are for advanced users who
want to build communications applications in
Macromedia Flash and integrate Macromedia
Flash with applications built in ColdFusion or
other server-side systems.
Macromedia Flash Communication Server MX
Macromedia Flash Communication Server is 
a new Macromedia program that enables 
programmers to develop communications appli-
cations for Web sites. Some of the possibilities
include the following:
 Video teleconferencing
 Video broadcasting for presentations
 Audio messaging
 Text messaging
 Live chat rooms
 Polling
(continued)

Integrating Macromedia Flash with ColdFusion
616
 White boards
 Message boards (discussion groups)
To write the programming code, you can use
Dreamweaver to create server-side Action-
Script. A number of prebuilt components are
available as downloads from Macromedia’s
Web site to make it easy to create communica-
tions application. For further information, go to
the following URL:
www.macromedia.com/software/
flashcom
If the previous paragraphs have piqued your
interest, you may want to consider downloading
the trial version of Macromedia Flash Comm-
unication Server. After you download the trial
version and install it, you can peruse sample
applications that Macromedia has already cre-
ated for you. If you have a Web cam hooked up
to your computer, you can test the video capa-
bilities of Macromedia Flash Communication
Server. The Macromedia Flash Player acts as the
conduit between your Web camera and the
Macromedia Flash Communication Server. You
can download the trial version of Macromedia
Flash Communication Server at this URL:
www.macromedia.com/software/
flashcom/download/
components/license.html
Macromedia has created some ready-built
Macromedia Flash Communication Server com-
ponents. The ActionScript in these babies is
longer than most short stories, but don’t fret, you
don’t have to write it; Macromedia Flash geeks
have already done that for you. After you down-
load the Macromedia Flash Communication
Server components and install them, you have a
new sub-group in the Components panel called
Communications Components, as shown in the
following figure. Instead of creating the graphics
and ActionScript (which is very complicated),
you can just drag one of these components from
the Components panel into your Flash applica-
tion, and you’re good to go. You can download
the Macromedia Flash Communication Server
MX components at this URL:
www.macromedia.com/software/
flashcom/download/
components/index.html
Macromedia Flash Remoting MX
Macromedia Flash Remoting offers tools for
programmers to connect Macromedia Flash
with a Web server application built with
ColdFusion, .NET, or Java. You can integrate
Macromedia Flash with databases and Web
services by using special ActionScript com-
mands. You can use your elegant Macromedia
Flash artwork as the interface to display data
from databases. For more information, go to the
following URL:
www.macromedia.com/software/
flashremoting
Macromedia Flash Remoting is an excellent tool
you can use to create dynamic Flash applica-
tions. For example, if you want to create a Flash
application that displays a slide show, you can
use the Flash ListBox or ComboBox component
(continued)

Book V
Chapter 10
Integrating
Macromedia Flash 
MX 2004 
Integrating Macromedia Flash with ColdFusion
617
and create a function to populate the ListBox or
ComboBox with the titles and file names of the
images you want to load. The down side is that
if you need to change the images, you have to
edit the Flash movie and enter new values in the
ListBox or ComboBox. However, if you use
Macromedia Flash Remoting, you can access a
database that stores the titles and filenames of
the images and load them into the Flash appli-
cation through a ColdFusion component you
created in Dreamweaver. The ColdFusion
Component (or CFC as the ColdFusion geeks
refer to them) is the conduit between your Flash
application and the database. If you’ve dabbled
in ColdFusion and feel comfortable with
ActionScript, this is your ticket to creating
dynamic Flash applications. A cool Flash inter-
face with Macromedia Flash Remoting and the
odd ColdFusion Component or four adds up to
something very special.
Macromedia Flash Remoting can be accom-
plished with any server that has ColdFusion
installed. If you’re creating Macromedia Flash
Remoting applications for a client that has a
ColdFusion server, you can test the application
on your local machine using the version of
ColdFusion that ships with the Macromedia
Studio MX 2004 application. But the first step is
to download the Macromedia Flash Remoting
MX Components you find at this URL:
www.macromedia.com/software/
flashremoting/downloads/
components
After you download and install the components,
you may be a bit disappointed, because there are
no new components installed in Macromedia
Flash. That’s true, but a whole lot of actions are
added to the Actions panel that you find in the
Remoting book, as shown in the following figure.

oldFusion MX 6.1 Developer Edition is a rapid development environ-
ment for creating dynamic — not to mention compelling — Internet
applications. Three main components make up ColdFusion:
✦An application server
✦An administrative tool
✦A custom scripting language
Together, these three components give you a diverse set of tools that make
ColdFusion the quickest and easiest way to bring dynamic, interactive, data-
base-driven content to your Web site. (A database is a program, such as
Microsoft Access, that is used to collect information in tabular format: that
is, rows and columns.) In this chapter, we give you a basic introduction to
each of the three components as well as an overview of what makes a Web
site dynamic.

Creating Dynamic Web Sites
622
Creating Dynamic Web Sites
Web pages are wonderful. After you create a page with HyperText Markup
Language (HTML) and then upload it to a Web server (a program such as
Microsoft Internet Information Server [IIS] or Apache that enables people to
view your Web site), it’s ready to be viewed by the world. If you know HTML,
this approach is simple, but it can create problems when your Web site
expands in size and complexity. When your Web site grows, you may find
yourself wanting to do one or more of the following:
✦Display Web pages for a variety of different products or services by
maintaining the same look and feel (each page having the same banner,
company logo, background image, and so on).
✦Sort and display the same content in different ways. For example, you
may want to highlight sports articles over news articles on a page if a
user is more interested in sports than news.
✦Customize content based on actions that a user takes at a site.
✦Personalize content based on preferences that a user sets when visiting
your site.
✦Allow users to perform complex searches of documents and databases.
✦Create shopping carts and user accounts that keep track of purchases
and other shipping information.
If you’ve ever wanted to do any of these things, you’re longing to create a
dynamic Web site. Dynamic Web sites use a Web application server, such as
ColdFusion, to extend the capabilities of a standard Web server by creating
custom content for each browser request. A Web application server can also
connect to a database to retrieve information used to build pages, or it can
save information submitted by the user.
To demonstrate what we’re talking about, take a look at the Web site for the
California Healthcare Foundation, as shown in Figure 1-1. This foundation
provides a diverse set of information — reports, studies, analyses — on a
wide array of healthcare topics. From the figure, you can see that you can
click on any of a number of relevant healthcare-related topics. Within each
of these topics are literally hundreds of articles.
Instead of creating static (non-changing) pages for each of these topics and
their subsequent articles, the foundation can instead use the ColdFusion
application server and a database to drive its Web site, which allows the
foundation to use a handful of ColdFusion pages to do the following:

Book VI
Chapter 1
Introduction to
ColdFusion MX 6.1
Developer Edition
Creating Dynamic Web Sites
623
✦Look up the basic information about any number of reports and studies
that the foundation funds.
✦Insert data from a database into a specific topic or report template. A
template is a bit of HTML and ColdFusion Markup Language (CFML)
code that gets combined with data from a database to help construct a
Web page. Several templates may make up one individual page.
✦Display the topic or report page for an item that the user requests via a
Web browser.
The idea behind creating a dynamic Web site is that you try to create the
least number of templates to represent the largest number of pages on the
site. That way, when you change something on the site, you don’t have to
make the change yourself on every single page.
Figure 1-2 shows a topic within the California HealthCare Foundation. If you
compare Figure 1-2 with Figure 1-1, you can see that the topics are different,
but the architecture (design) of the two pages is identical.

Exploring the Components of ColdFusion
624
Exploring the Components of ColdFusion
The workhorse of ColdFusion is the application server, which provides a
fast, reliable platform for your Web applications. In order to make the most
of this powerful application server, you need to be able to configure and
control it, which you do by using the following:
✦ColdFusion Administrator: The ColdFusion Administrator allows you to
configure the server to meet your specific needs. (Read more about this
in the upcoming section, “The ColdFusion Administrator,” and in Book VI,
Chapter 2.)
✦ColdFusion Markup Language (CFML): ColdFusion Markup Language
can be used to communicate instructions to the application server.
(Read more about CFML in the upcoming section, “Investigating CFML,”
and in Book VI, Chapter 4.)
The ColdFusion Application Server is built on top of the Java 2 Platform,
Enterprise Edition (J2EE). For more information on J2EE, where it came
from, and who supports it, check out the Sun Microsystems Web site at
http://java.sun.com.

Understanding the Role of the Web Application Server
625
Understanding the Role of the Web Application Server
An application server executes the business logic of your Web application.
By business logic, we mean the way in which you want something to run for
your business — in this case, how you want your Web site to display con-
tent. Your business logic may be as simple as verifying (that is, ensuring
that users have entered all the required information) the data that the user
enters in a form on your Web page and inserting it into a database. No matter
what sort of task you need to accomplish, if it requires any sort of logical
processing (conversion of CFML code to HTML), the application server is
the component of ColdFusion that does the work.
The infrastructure of most Web applications can be divided into three parts,
which are commonly referred to as a three-tier architecture:
✦Display Tier: A Web browser
✦Application Tier: ColdFusion
✦Database Tier: Any compatible database
The application server is responsible for managing the interactions between
all three of these tiers. It accepts inputs from the Display Tier, interprets the
CFML in the Application Tier, and brokers requests to databases at the
Database Tier.
Investigating CFML
In a three-tier application, the application server executes all the business
logic, as we discuss in the previous section. In ColdFusion, you use CFML
to build that business logic.
CFML provides the instructions for each page while it is processed by the
application server. Like HTML, CFML uses tags, which instruct the applica-
tion server as to what kind of functions to perform. Built-in tags can handle
many common tasks required by Web applications, including the following:
✦Page formatting
✦Form validation
✦Database access
✦Generating and sending e-mail
✦User security
✦Generating charts and graphs

Setting Up the ColdFusion Environment
626
In addition to tags, CFML also includes hundreds of built-in functions (best
to think of them as tools built into ColdFusion) that you can use to test and
manipulate your data. By adding CFML tags and functions to your pages,
you build the instructions for the application server. We cover CFML in
more detail in Book VI, Chapter 4.
The ColdFusion Administrator
ColdFusion Markup Language provides the application server with instruc-
tions for each page, but some information (such as database connectivity)
is only configured once for the entire server — and thus, all the sites that
use that server. The ColdFusion Administrator is used to control server-
wide settings, such as the following:
✦Database connections.
✦Variable scopes. (Check out Book VI, Chapter 3 for more information on
what variable scoping means in the context of ColdFusion.)
✦Debugging options.
✦Security settings.
✦Application logging.
The ColdFusion Administrator is not only used to set up your server, but
it’s also a valuable maintenance tool for reporting on things going on in your
Web site. We cover the ColdFusion Administrator, including how to use it to
set up database connections, change your logging settings, set your debug-
ging options, and optimize the speed of your Web site, in more detail in
Book VI, Chapter 2.
Setting Up the ColdFusion Environment
To begin working with ColdFusion, you need access to a working server.
You may want to find an Internet service provider (ISP) that already runs
ColdFusion, or you can install your own server right on your desktop PC.
Be aware that ColdFusion Server has traditionally been available for both
the Unix and Windows environments, but Macromedia Studio is a Windows-
and Macintosh-only product, and the Macintosh version of Macromedia
Studio does not include ColdFusion.
Finding an ISP
If you need to get a site up and running as soon as possible, hosting your
Web application via an ISP saves you the trouble of installing and configur-
ing your own server. You generally have limited control over the server
configuration with an ISP, but that drawback is usually outweighed by the
other benefits of using an existing server.

Book VI
Chapter 1
Introduction to
ColdFusion MX 6.1
Developer Edition
Setting Up the ColdFusion Environment
627
A large number of ISPs have offered ColdFusion hosting for years, and many
of these providers now support ColdFusion. You need to check the version
of ColdFusion that the ISP supports before you sign up. Here are some of the
more well-known ColdFusion ISPs:
✦CrystalTech: www.crystaltech.com
✦CFDynamics: www.cfdynamics.com
✦Definitive Web Solutions: www.dwsgroup.com
✦Edge Web Hosting: www.edgeWebhosting.net
Installing the application server
Installing your own application server on your personal computer is a
great way to learn about ColdFusion. The Developer Edition is designed
for a single user machine for personal development. You would want to
install ColdFusion MX 6.1 Developer Edition on a Web server that is going
to be put into production. (For more information on ColdFusion, check
out the Macromedia ColdFusion site at www.macromedia.com/software/
coldfusion.)
The setup wizard on the Macromedia Studio CD walks you through the
application server installation process. To set up ColdFusion, just follow
these steps:
1. Insert the Macromedia Studio CD into your CD-ROM drive.
The auto-run utility brings up an interactive menu from which you can
install all the Macromedia Studio programs. If AutoPlay is disabled on
your computer, browse to the root directory of your CD-ROM drive
(usually the D: drive) and select Setup.exe from there.
2. Click Install ColdFusion MX 6.1 Developer Edition.
The Welcome screen appears.
3. From the ColdFusion MX 6.1 installation screen, select your language
and then click OK.
4. Click Next at the initial installation screen.
5. Select the I Accept the Terms in the License Agreement radio button
on the Licensing Agreement screen and then click Next.
6. Enter the ColdFusion serial number in the Serial Number field, or
select the 30-Day Trial (Enterprise Edition) or the Developer Edition
(Single-IP Only) check box, and then click Next.
If you already have an installation of ColdFusion MX on your system, the
installer will preselect the Update ColdFusion MX to ColdFusion MX 6.1

radio button. Otherwise, it selects the Install New Version of ColdFusion
MX 6.1 option.
7. Select the Server Configuration radio button on the Install
Configuration screen, and then click Next.
8. If you have a previous version of ColdFusion server running on your
machine, select Next at the warning screen reminding you to shut
down all ColdFusion services.
It’s always a good idea to have ColdFusion completely shut down when
installing an upgrade.
9. Choose a directory where you want to install the product.
By default, ColdFusion installs the product in C:\CFusionMX, and the
Web files in C:\CFusionMX\wwwroot. You can change this by clicking
the Change button. Otherwise, you can just click the Next button to
install into the default directories.
As a general rule, if you’ve got a partitioned drive (meaning a C: drive
and a D: drive that are both hard drives), then it’s a good idea to install
your Web files on the D: drive. This makes it harder for potential hack-
ers to find any other information on your computer, should you be
attacked.
10. Select a Web server you want to use with ColdFusion and click Next.
For personal development on a single machine, we recommend select-
ing the Built-in Web Server option (as you may or may not have another
Web server installed on your machine). For Microsoft IIS, you can con-
figure the All IIS Websites option. If you choose the Configure Specific IIS
Website or Another Web Server radio button, you must click Add and
step through the wizard.
Choose the Web server you want to configure, as shown in Figure 1-3.
If you choose IIS, then select the individual Web site in the IIS Web Site
drop-down list. If you choose another Web server (for example, Apache),
enter the path to the Web server’s configuration directory (for example,
C:\Apache Group\Apache2\conf).
If you chose the Built-in Web server option (such as IIS) in Step 10, con-
tinue on to Step 11b.
11a. Enter the Web server’s Web root path, and click Next. Continue to
Step 11b.
If you chose any Web server other than the Built-in Web server option
(such as IIS) in Step 10, then the installer will prompt you to enter the
Web root location for the ColdFusion Administrator, as shown in Figure
1-4. The installer will register this path in ColdFusion as the Web server
root, and also create the ColdFusion Administrator directory (CFIDE)
in this path.

11b. Enter and Confirm your Administrator password, and then click Next.
This password is required to enter into the ColdFusion Administrator.
12. Review your installation settings and then click the Install button to
install the product.
Installation takes a few minutes, and the progress is shown as the instal-
lation is occurring.
13. After the installation is complete, click the Done button to complete
your installation.
Leave the Launch the Configuration Wizard in the Default Browser radio
button selected to go directly into the ColdFusion Administrator and
finish configuring your server.

Do this using the shortcut in the Start menu or navigating directly
to http://localhost:8500/CFIDE/administrator/index.cfm
(http://127.0.0.1/CFIDE/administrator/index.cfm also works)
via your Web browser. (The administrator is a Web-based application.)
2. Enter your password.
Use the username and password for the administrator (as opposed to
the RDS; see Step 11b in the list in the preceding section) that you cre-
ated during the installation process to log on to the administrator, as
shown in Figure 1-5.
A number of administrative tasks, including setting up database connec-
tions, configuring e-mail, and setting your debugging options are covered in
more detail in Book VI, Chapter 2.
If you’re using another Web server, such as IIS or Apache, you also need to
make sure that that application server is running properly and that it has its
default directory as the same location where you installed ColdFusion.

Introducing Databases

Introducing Databases
Databases are often an integral part of any dynamic site, and ColdFusion is
no exception. A database, in very general terms, is simply a structured set
of data. The power of a database is in the ability to organize data for easy
retrieval when requested. If you’ve ever used a spreadsheet program, such
as Microsoft Excel, you’ve probably created a structured collection of data
that could, in fact, be a database.
Databases are generally made up of the following elements:
✦Tables: The containers for similar sets of data, made up of columns,
rows, and cells. For example, a table might contain records (a collection
of rows in a table) of all your products.
✦Cells: The individual blocks that make up the table. Cells contain only a
single piece of data and are grouped by columns and rows.
✦Columns: The vertical block of cells that groups the data in the table
into categories. Using our previous example of the product table, the
data entered into columns in that table might include things like Name,
Price, and Description.
✦Rows: The horizontal block of cells in a table that contains the infor-
mation for each individual record, spanning all the columns. Using the
example of the product table, a row contains all the information about a
single product, such as Silver Streak Bowling Ball, $200, and The
finest pure silver bowling ball money can buy.
Databases come in all shapes and sizes, from the simple to the complex.
Following are the most common database types:
✦Flat file: A text file that contains a single set of columns and rows, with
the data usually being separated by commas or tabs. A Comma Separated
Values file (CSV) is an example of a flat file.
✦Relational: A collection of tables with common data elements (values in
like-named columns) between them, providing expanded collection and
reporting capabilities. These usually require a query language to retrieve
information from the database.
When you become more comfortable with ColdFusion, you begin to see (and
of course, we show you!) just where databases can be extremely useful. For
now, you can whet your appetite by checking out Figure 1-6, which shows an
example of a database table in Microsoft Access. Relational database design,
which is central to harnessing the power of ColdFusion, is covered in more
detail in Book VI, Chapter 6.

Taking a Quick Tour of ColdFusion in Dreamweaver
Dreamweaver MX 2004 has been specially designed to make writing
ColdFusion pages easier. The great thing about Dreamweaver is its ability
to flip back and forth between Code view and Design view:
✦Design view: Enables you to see a visual representation of your page,
just like it would appear in a Web browser.
✦Code view: Gives you direct control over the code. If you’ve used previ-
ous versions of ColdFusion Studio or HomeSite (the HTML editor that is
part of previous versions of ColdFusion), you may notice that the Code
view in Dreamweaver looks similar to those products.
✦Split Screen mode: Displays both the code and the graphical represen-
tation on your screen, as shown in Figure 1-7.
When you’re using Code view, many features are available to you that are
made specifically for ColdFusion development:
✦CFML toolbars
✦CFML function auto-complete
✦CFML validation

efore you begin writing code for your Web application, familiarize
yourself with the ColdFusion server. If you’re running your own server,
you have the ability to set things up just the way you want. Even if you’re
using a preconfigured server at your Internet service provider (ISP), you
want to know how the server is configured to aid in your development
process.
This chapter walks you through a few important tasks that are accom-
plished in the ColdFusion Administrator.
Exploring the Functionality of the
ColdFusion Administrator
The ColdFusion Administrator is a Web application that helps the human
administrator manage the server by controlling a wide array of server set-
tings. Although several of the server settings are aimed at giving the devel-
oper important information to assist in the writing of ColdFusion Markup
Language (CFML) pages, the ColdFusion Administrator does not create CFML
pages.
Many of the tasks in the ColdFusion Administrator are directly related to
tasks that a ColdFusion developer carries out. For example, a developer
cannot query a database if the database is not registered as an active data
source through the Administrator. After a server is configured properly with
the ColdFusion Administrator, the CFML developer can create a Web appli-
cation that uses the many features of the application server.

Table 2-1 shows how the server settings correspond to actual CFML pages.

and databases.
Sets up debugging options
Outputs all the queries, variables, and processes
at the bottom of the rendered ColdFusion page so
that developers can monitor and fix their code.
Defines Web services
Creates Web services. A Web service is a bridge
from your application server to another server
with an application that you want to be able to
access from within your application. This is a
new feature to ColdFusion.
Logging On to the ColdFusion Administrator
Before you can work with any of the administrative tools in ColdFusion
Administrator, you must first log on, which is a two-step process:
1. Launch the ColdFusion Administrator.
Because the Administrator is a Web application, you access it with
your browser. The default URL of the logon page is http://servername/
cfide/Administrator/index.cfm, where servername is the Internet
Protocol (IP) number or fully qualified domain name of your server.
If you’re using the ColdFusion Web server, it uses port 8500, so the
URL becomes http://localhost:8500/cfide/Administrator/
index.cfm.
When you enter this URL, the logon screen appears, as shown in 
Figure 2-1.
2. Enter your password.
When you installed ColdFusion (See Book 6, Chapter 1 for more on
installing ColdFusion MX 6.1 Developer Edition), you were asked to
provide a password for the Administrator. Similarly, if you’re using
ColdFusion Administrator at your ISP, your ISP should have provided
you with a password to log on to the ColdFusion Administrator. No user-
name is required, and all administrative users use the same password.

If you’re working in a secure development environment or using Remote
Development Services (RDS), you can choose to turn off the password pro-
tection by clicking the CF Admin Password hyperlink or the RDS Password
hyperlink under the Security section in the left navigation frame of the
ColdFusion Administrator. This just means that you’ll have one less pass-
word to worry about!
Working with the ColdFusion Administrator
The ColdFusion Administrator tasks are divided into five sections. Each of
these sections, and their associated tasks, is listed as a series of text links
on the left-hand side of all Administrator pages. The sections, shown in
Figure 2-2, are as follows:
✦Server Settings: The tasks in this section control how the ColdFusion
server behaves. The settings here affect overall server performance.
✦Data & Services: These tasks control how the ColdFusion server con-
nects to and exposes databases, Verity search indexes (collections
of data used to power ColdFusion’s built-in search engine), and Web
services.

✦Debugging & Logging: This section has tasks used to set debugging and
logging options as well as tools to analyze your system and schedule
tasks.
✦Extensions: Tasks here allow you to install and remove components
that extend the ColdFusion server’s capabilities.
✦Security: The security tasks include setting passwords and controlling
access to resources.
Creating Data Sources
When you want to use information from a database in your Web application,
you need to register the connection to the database with the ColdFusion
Server. This registration process creates a data source. Each data source
has a unique name that you use in your CFML to connect to the underlying
database.
Many popular databases, such as Microsoft Access, Microsoft SQL, and
MySQL, can be registered as data sources. After your data source has been
set up, you can use the <CFQUERY> tag to access the data. We show you how
to do this in more detail in Book VI, Chapter 4.

Creating Data Sources
639
Setting up a data source
The exact procedure for setting up a data source varies, depending on the
type of database that you’re registering. We outline the process below for
creating a connection between the ColdFusion server and Microsoft Access.
Access is the most common database that is used with ColdFusion. If you
are registering a different type of database, the process will be different after
Step 4. Here’s how you do it:
1. Under the Data & Services section in the left navigation frame of the
ColdFusion Administrator home page, click the Data Sources link.
This brings up the Data Sources main page, as shown in Figure 2-3.
2. In the table titled Add New Data Source, enter a name for your data
source in the Data Source Name text field.
As a general rule, this name should not include any spaces.
3. From the Driver drop-down list, select the database driver that
matches your database.
We use Microsoft Access for this example.
Figure 2-3:
The Data
Sources
main page.

Creating Data Sources
640
4. Click the Add button.
The Data Source Driver Information page, as shown in Figure 2-4, appears.
On this page, you enter specific information about your database.
5. Click the Browse Server button next to the Database File field to find
the database file that you want to register.
In this case, the file is a Microsoft Access database, which has the file-
name extension .mdb. You can also type the pathway directly in the
Database File field.
6. Leave the System Database File field blank.
From this field, you can choose to use Windows NT/Windows 2000
security by selecting a system database. (You click the Browser Server
button to select a system database.) In reality, very few people use this
feature, largely because of concerns about possible holes in Windows NT/
Windows 2000 security. If you do want to use it, though, the default loca-
tion for this file is C:\winnt\system32\system.mdw.

7. Select the Use Default Username check box to use the Open Database
Connectivity (ODBC) default if you do not want to pass a username
and password from your <CFQUERY> tag.
8. (Optional) Input a ColdFusion username and ColdFusion password.
This is an optional setting, but you can specify a username and pass-
word to pass to the database if no username or password is specified
through a ColdFusion <CFQUERY> tag.
9. (Optional) Enter a descriptive note in the Description text field.
10. Click the Submit button.
Your new data source is verified automatically. Look for a confirmation
message that says OK just below the data sources title in the main work-
ing area.
Your new data source will appear in the Connected Data Sources table at
the bottom of the page. If the data source was created successfully, the data
source name should be highlighted in green, and the status will be OK. If
this is not the case, check the top of the page for an error message describ-
ing what went wrong.
To use a Microsoft Access database on Windows 98 or Windows Me, you must
set up an Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) connection with Windows,
and then use the Java Database Connectivity-Open Database Connectivity
(JDBC-ODBC) driver from within ColdFusion. The Microsoft Access driver and
the ODBC driver that come with ColdFusion will not work on Windows 98/
Me because these drivers require services that are not available under
Windows 98/Me.
Other data source tasks
In addition to creating data sources, the Administrator is also used to edit,
verify, and delete existing data sources. Each of these operations is repre-
sented by an icon in the Connected Data Sources table, which is shown in
Figure 2-5.
The following list highlights what each of the data source operations does:
✦Edit: Brings you to the data source settings page
✦Verify: Verifies that the data source is operational and updates the
Status column
✦Delete: Begins the process of removing the data source

Connecting to a Mail Server
642
Connecting to a Mail Server
Although ColdFusion is not a mail server, it can connect to an existing
mail server to provide e-mail services to your Web application. This can be
exceptionally useful if, for example, you want to send a confirmation e-mail
to customers when they purchase a product or sign up for a newsletter.
ColdFusion supports both sending and retrieving e-mail by using the Simple
Mail Transport Protocol (SMTP) and POP3 protocols, respectively.
ColdFusion uses a spooled architecture to handle sending e-mails. You may
be familiar with spooling because it is commonly used for network printers.
E-mail spooling uses the same concept to manage the sending of e-mail in a
timely manner. When ColdFusion encounters an e-mail request while build-
ing a Web page, it sends the request to the spool when it is received. As soon
as the e-mail is successfully placed on the spool, ColdFusion continues to
create the output page. The spool sends e-mail messages in the order that
they were received without holding up the processing of your CFML. Using
the spool allows ColdFusion to build pages quickly regardless of the speed
of the e-mail server being used.

Connecting to a Mail Server
643
Use the following steps to set up a connection to an e-mail server:
1. From the left navigation frame, click the Mail link under the Server
Settings section.
The Mail Server Settings page, as shown in Figure 2-6, appears.
2. In the Mail Server text field, enter the IP address or the fully quali-
fied domain name (usually mail.yourdomain.com, for example) of
your mail server.
3. Enable the Verify Mail Server Connection option by selecting its
check box.
When this option is enabled, the Administrator attempts to connect to
the mail server when you click the Submit Changes button. If a connec-
tion cannot be established, you receive an error at the top of the page.
You also get a message if the verification succeeded.
4. Enter the port that the mail server uses in the Server Port text field.
Normally, mail servers use port 25, which is the default value.
Figure 2-6:

Server
Connection
Settings
page.

Connecting to a Mail Server
644
5. Enter the IP addresses for any back-up mail servers that you may be
using.
This is a new (and optional) feature in ColdFusion MX 6.1. In this field,
you can specify other mail servers to be used in case your primary mail
server fails. You can enter more than one simply by adding a comma
between the IP addresses.
6. Keep the Maintain Connection to Mail Server check box selected.
7. (Optional) Enter a new time in the Connection Timeout text field.
Connection timeout specifies the number of seconds that the ColdFusion
server should wait for a response from the mail server before logging an
error. The default value is 60 seconds.
Leave this alone unless you know that you will be connecting to a slow
mail server, meaning either a mail server that runs on an old machine or
one that has a large amount of traffic.
8. In the Spool Interval text field, enter a length of time in seconds.
The spool interval determines how often the messages on the spool will
be sent to the mail server. The default value of 15 seconds (which can
be left as-is) attempts to empty the spool four times a minute.
9. Enter a value for the Mail Delivery Threads.
This value specifies the number of individual mail messages that are
sent through the server at any one time.
10. Keep the Spool Mail Messages for Delivery to Disk option selected.
This ensures that your e-mail messages are saved on your hard drive
while waiting to be sent, saving your server memory space.
11. Leave the Maximum Number of Messages Spooled to Memory setting
alone.
Again, the way to go here is to use the spooling to disk setting, so this
won’t mean anything and you’re free to keep on going!
12. Click the Submit Changes button to set up your e-mail server.
Be sure that the gray bars enclosing the button turn green, signifying
success. If they turn red, look for an error message at the top of the
page.
Even if you validate your mail server, it’s a good idea to send a test message
from your Web application. A valid connection to the mail server does not
guarantee that the Web application will send e-mail properly. If you try send-
ing mail to yourself and it’s not successful, you’ll know because you never
got the message.

Controlling Logging on Your Site
645
Controlling Logging on Your Site
Basic logging is set up automatically when you install ColdFusion. The logs
created by ColdFusion Server give the human administrator information
about how well the server is handling its many tasks. Log entries are grouped
together by type into separate log files.
Two tasks are related to log files: Logging Settings and Log Files. You see
these two task items under the Debugging and Logging heading in the list
along the left-hand side of the Administrator page. The Logging Settings
task allows you to customize the following:
✦Control where logs are stored
✦Specify how big a log can get before it is archived
✦Control how many archives should be kept
✦Specify what sort of information is logged
To view the actual log entries, click the Log Files hyperlink in the left naviga-
tion frame. This will present a list of all of the logs on the server. Table 2-2
describes the most common log files.
Table 2-2
Common Log Files and Their Contents
Filename
Description of Contents
application.log
All errors that are reported to the end user
mail.log
Errors that are generated by the SMTP mail server
server.log
Internal server errors that are generated by ColdFusion
You can view any log by clicking the Action button with the magnifying glass
or just by clicking its name. These buttons are in the Actions area of the Log
Files page. The following four actions are available:
✦View: Displays the contents of the log in the browser.
✦Download: Downloads the raw log file.
✦Archive: Creates a numbered copy of the log and clears the current log.
✦Delete: Removes the log. A new one may be created by the server as
needed.
When you create an archive with the archive button, the log file is renamed.
The new name is just the old name with a digit at the end (1 if it is the first
archive, 2 if it is the second, and so on). The important thing to note is that
archive files do not show up in the Log Files page.

Debugging Options for Building Your Site
646
Debugging Options for Building Your Site
During the development of your Web application, you will most likely en-
counter errors. Some errors are quickly fixed, yet others require checking
your CFML line by line to find the source. This process of hunting down and
fixing errors is debugging.
ColdFusion can help you with the debugging process by including debug-
ging data at the bottom of each page that it generates. Although there are a
number of subtle options, here are the most important settings to consider:
✦Exceptions (Server Errors): Errors that occurred when your ColdFusion
page made a request to the server.
✦Execution times for each page template: How long it takes all the code
on a page to be read and then processed.
✦SQL Queries and Stored Procedures: The actual queries that are made
to the server. This shows you how many queries were made as well as
what the specific queries were.
✦Page Variables: Shows all the page variables that are active for a given
page. You can select from the nine different variable types (cookies,
application, and so on).
To enable debugging, simply select the Enable Debugging check box on the
Debugging Settings page. The Debugging IP Address page allows you to select
which desktop PCs, by IP number, are sent the debugging info. If you leave it
blank, the information is sent to all PCs that view the pages.
If you’re using Internet Explorer 4 (or above) or Netscape Navigator 6 (or
above), check out the dockable debugging window. Just select dockable.cfm
from the Select Debugging Output Format drop-down list on the Debugging
Settings page. This option puts all the debugging info into a Dynamic HTML
(DHTML) collapsible tree (much like the Windows Explorer), which can be
displayed in a pop-up window or in a frame right alongside your CFML pages.

oldFusion is an application development suite that helps you create
Web applications quickly and easily. When you use ColdFusion, you’re
actually using several tools in concert:
✦An application server: This software processes requests from a
ColdFusion file and returns HyperText Markup Language (HTML) to
the end user’s browser.
✦An editing tool: This tool allows you to create and edit your own sites
by using the ColdFusion tag and scripting language. The scripting lan-
guage is described in more detail in Book VI, Chapter 4.
✦An administration tool: This tool can be used to manage various ele-
ments of your application, including data sources, mail servers, and
logs. You can read more about the ColdFusion Administrator in Book VI,
Chapter 2.
Together, these three items provide developers with a power suite of tools
to create custom HTML for every site visitor, based on user input and other
data.
On its own, a Web server can only read files and deliver them to the
browser. In order to rapidly build a robust Web application, the ColdFusion
Application Server makes use of the ColdFusion Markup Language (CFML).
CFML uses tags, which are very similar in structure to HTML tags (such as
<HTML>, <BODY>, and <TABLE>), and functions to provide simple, yet

powerful, tools to instruct the ColdFusion Application Server. The combina-
tion of CFML and the application server give you, the ColdFusion developer,
the ability to provide the end user with a wide array of features:
✦Database-driven pages
✦E-commerce
✦Advanced security
✦Search engines on your site
This chapter focuses on the real magic behind ColdFusion — the ColdFusion
Application Server and the scripting language used to drive it. Get comfy in
that computer chair, grab a cup of coffee, and prepare to make your sites
come alive!
Understanding the ColdFusion
Application Server Model
The World Wide Web is built on a client-server architecture. Both client
(browser) and server perform specialized tasks, and together they create
what is known as the Web. The browser’s job is to interface with the user
and make requests of the server. The server needs to be able to handle
the user’s request — and possibly thousands of other simultaneous user
requests — and return the proper response. The Web server may only need
to read an HTML file to create the response, or it may pass the request on
to the ColdFusion Application Server for advanced processing.
The ColdFusion Application Server works in conjunction with a standard
Web server and can be installed alongside most of today’s popular Web
servers, including the following:
✦Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS)
✦Netscape Enterprise Server
✦iPlanet Enterprise Server
✦Apache Web Server
✦ColdFusion Internal Web Server
When the Web server receives a request for a ColdFusion page, which is
identified by its .cfm or .cfml extension, the request is passed on to the
ColdFusion Application Server. The application server interprets the CFML
embedded in the page, processes the instructions, and returns the result to
the Web server, which sends the final response to the end user’s Web
browser. Figure 3-1 shows how these transactions take place.

ColdFusion Markup Language is the language that allows ColdFusion to
create dynamic Web sites. Most ColdFusion pages contain a mix of CFML
and HTML; each language has its own uses within the ColdFusion page.
HTML is commonly used for the following tasks:
✦Controlling overall page layout
✦Building tables
✦Displaying forms
✦Setting colors and styles
✦Implementing menus, rollovers, and other advanced browser features
You can use CFML to make a portion of your page customizable, based on
user input, in the following ways:
✦Retrieve and display data from a database
✦Create dynamic forms
✦Build complex navigation
✦Control user sessions (a user’s time visiting the site) and security

Getting Acquainted with CFML
650
Getting Acquainted with CFML
ColdFusion Markup Language is a tag-based language that incorporates
many of the features found in traditional programming languages, including
the following:
✦Functions: Tools in the language that perform specific operations
✦Variables: Values that are used in areas of your site that can change,
depending on condition
✦Expressions: Collections of variables, functions, and operators (such as
+ and &) that are used to generate some specific desired action
In the following sections, you find a more detailed introduction to each of
these concepts, plus some practical examples that you can use to dive right
into using CFML.
Introducing CFML tags
CFML tags are very similar to HTML tags, only more powerful. CFML instructs
the ColdFusion server how to handle the ColdFusion page, just like how
HTML tags instruct the browser to display a Web page. In the end, though,
the CFML is converted into HTML and won’t be there when the page is dis-
played in a browser.
The format of CFML tags follows a few simple rules:
✦CFML tags are enclosed in angle brackets (< and >).
✦CFML tags begin with the letters cf.
✦CFML tags can come in pairs, meaning that they have a closing tag that
starts with a slash (/) in addition to their starting tag. Some tags, how-
ever, are fully self-contained, such as the <CFINLCUDE> and the <CFSET>
tags.
✦CFML tags may contain additional modifiers within the tag that allow
you to specify more information about what the tag should do.
✦CFML tags are case-insensitive, so <cfoutput> is the same as 
<CFOUTPUT>.
ColdFusion contains over 100 tags, which enable you to do everything from
querying a database to making a form. We include the ten most common
CFML tags in Table 3-1, with their respective functions.

Getting Acquainted with CFML
651
Table 3-1
Common CFML Tags
CFML Tag
Function
<CFINCLUDE>
Grabs another file to be included in your page.
<CFOUTPUT>
Outputs content to the screen (both HTML and variables).
<CFQUERY>
Sets up and sends a query to a database.
<CFLOOP>
Loops through a dataset. (Generally, these are generated
from a <CFQUERY>.)
<CFSET>
Allows you to create a variable and its value.
<CFIF>, <CFELSE>, 
The three tags in combination enable you to create condi-
<CFELSEIF>
tional operations. (For example: If this, then do that; if not,
then do this other thing.)
<CFFORM>
Creates a more feature-rich HTML <FORM>.
<CFINSERT>
Specifies the database, database table, and content to
insert.
<CFCASE>, <CFSWITCH>
Evaluates an expression and then allows you to choose dif-
ferent responses based on the value of the expression.
<CFPARAM>
Allows you to test for a given parameter; and if it does not
exist, assign a default value and data type for it.
When the ColdFusion Application Server processes the page, all the CFML
tags are replaced with the results of the commands that are processed. The
resulting HTML page should never contain any of your CFML tags. Figure 3-2
shows how this operation occurs.
Identifying the role of the pound sign (#)
The <CFOUTPUT> tag makes special use of the pound sign (#). When a text
expression is included between two pound signs, it lets the ColdFusion
Application Server know to look for a value that corresponds to the name
of the variable within the pound signs. (See Book VI, Chapter 5 for more on
variables.) For example, if you have a variable named myname and you want
the value of that variable to be output to the screen, you could use the fol-
lowing bit of CFML code:
<CFOUTPUT> Hello, my name is #myname#. </CFOUTPUT>
The text enclosed by the <CFOUTPUT> tags is unchanged by the server
unless pound signs surround it.
In addition to simply looking for variables, ColdFusion can evaluate expres-
sions within the pound signs, as the example in the next section shows.

Getting Acquainted with CFML
652
If you want to display a pound sign within a <CFOUTPUT> tag, just put two
pound signs together, and they will be displayed as one. For example, the
following expression prints Dial #0 for an Operator:
<CFOUTPUT> Dial ##0 for an Operator</CFOUTPUT>
Putting a tag to work
Creating a ColdFusion page can be as simple as writing a few lines of code
that answer the age old question, “What is two plus two?” We created a brief
example that demonstrates how to answer the question as a ColdFusion
page. Here’s the code:
<HTML>
<HEAD>
<TITLE>CFML Tags</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<CFOUTPUT>two plus two equals #2+2#</CFOUTPUT>
</BODY>
</HTML>

The preceding sample looks a lot like HTML because most of it is HTML.
The addition of the CFML tag (<CFOUTPUT>) and a .cfm extension to the
filename of the page turns a simple HTML page into a ColdFusion page. Here
are the steps to create your own .cfm page:
1. Open your favorite HTML text editor.
Dreamweaver in Code view works well.
2. Enter the text of the sample CFML page (from the preceding example).
3. Save your work as four.cfm in a directory running the ColdFusion
Application Server.
On IIS in Windows, this is generally C:/inetpub/wwwroot. Check out
Book VI, Chapter 2 for more information on setting up your ColdFusion
Application Server.
4. Load the page in your browser.
If you saved the page in the default location (like wwwroot), the URL
should be http://localhost/four.cfm, as shown in Figure 3-3.
Figure 3-3:
Two plus
two equals
four!

Getting Acquainted with CFML
654
Of course, the HTML that is sent to the browser is what’s really important. If
you view the source of your page while it’s displayed in the browser, you see
that the <CFOUTPUT> tags have been removed and that the simple addition
(2+2) between the pound signs has been replaced by the sum. The HTML
should look like this:
<HTML>
<HEAD>
<TITLE>CFML Tags</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
two plus two equals 4
</BODY>
</HTML>
Working with variables
When you are writing CFML, you may want to store information in memory
for later use, which is exactly what a variable does. A variable is a named
container used to temporarily store information.
Sometimes the value of a variable comes from an external source, such as a
Web form; other times, you create the variables yourself. In ColdFusion, you
can use the <CFSET> tag to create a variable. A <CFSET> tag looks like this:
<CFSET team_name=”Pin Pals”>
This tag sets the value of a variable called team_name to the text string
“Pin Pals”.
Naming variables
You can name your variables just about anything you want, but you should
always follow a few rules:
✦Variables must consist of letters, numbers, and underscores only.
✦Variables should not start with a number.
✦Variables should not contain spaces.
✦Variables are case-insensitive. (LAST_NAME is the same as last_name.)
Usually, you want to choose a name that is clear and concise. The name
should be long enough to fully describe the contents of the variable . . . but
not so long that it takes too long to type. Table 3-2 summarizes some good
and bad choices for variable names. ColdFusion also has a set of reserved
words that can’t be used for variables, such as anything starting with cf_,
scope names such as session or form, or CFML script language names. For

Understanding variable scope
Each variable used in your ColdFusion pages belongs to a particular scope
(in what area the variable exists), as summarized in Table 3-3. The scope
determines the following:
✦How the variable was created
✦How long the variable is available
✦Where the variable can be used
Table 3-3
Common Scope Types
Scope
Description
Variables
The default Variables scope holds user-defined variables that
are available only on the page where they are created.
Request
The Request scope holds variables that are available to any page
used during a single HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) request.
Form
Variables created in an HTML form are placed in the Form scope.
Cookie
End-user browser cookies are made available to ColdFusion in the
Cookie scope.
Session
The Session scope holds variables that are available to each user
during a single browser session.
Application
Variables in the Application scope are available to all users of
the Web application.

Getting Acquainted with CFML
656
All variables belong to one scope or another. If you don’t explicitly declare
the scope (you do this by adding the scope as a prefix to the variable name,
so a form variable would look like this: FORM.myvariable), the default scope,
Variables, is used. Two different scopes can contain variables of the same
name without a problem. Each variable in a scope is held in a separate
area of the computer’s memory from variables in other scopes. A variable
named Form.username (created by an HTML form) would not conflict with
Cookie.username, which is a variable linked to the browser cookie.
Exploring data types
Variables can hold a variety of types of information. The type of information
stored in a variable, which is its data type, determines how ColdFusion eval-
uates the variable. A number of variable types are available in ColdFusion,
and variables can be generated and represented in a variety of ways. All
variable types will fall into one of the following four categories. (These cat-
egories are explained further in Book VI, Chapter 4.)
✦Simple: Simple variables hold a single value. You can read and write a
value directly from a simple variable. Numbers, text strings, dates, and
Boolean (true/false) values are stored in simple variables.
✦Complex: Complex variables can hold more than one value. ColdFusion
arrays and queries are complex variables. Complex variables often hold
multiple simple variables. A database query, for example, might hold a
list of names and numbers, each of which is a simple value by itself, but
when they are combined into a single query, become a complex variable.
✦Binary: The binary data type is used to hold information that is used
directly by the computer, such as image files. Binary data is usually
unreadable by humans and requires computer processing to become
useful.
✦Objects: Objects are variables that contain data, as well as methods to
manipulate that data, all wrapped up into a single variable. ColdFusion
supports several different types of objects, including COM objects,
ColdFusion components, JavaBeans, and Web Services.
You don’t need to declare a data type for a variable, but as a practice, it’s a
good idea to do so for more complex variables.
Using expressions
An expression is a grouping of variables, constants, operators, and/or func-
tion calls that can be evaluated by the ColdFusion Application Server to give
a single value. Simple expressions can be created with a single variable, but

Book VI
Chapter 3
ColdFusion MX 6.1
Developer Edition
Basics
Getting Acquainted with CFML
657
others may involve several function calls. The result of an expression can be
assigned to a variable or used to determine what action a CFML page must
take.
The following <CFSET> tag assigns the result of the expression score+10 to
the variable final_score:
<CFSET final_score=score+10>
The preceding expression consists of a variable (score), a constant (10), and
the addition operator (+). Other expressions might make use of function
calls. For example, the following expression between the # signs is used by
the <CFOUTPUT> tag to display the formatted date. It consists of two func-
tion calls, Now() and DateFormat(), that are called in succession.
<CFOUTPUT>Today is #DateFormat( Now(), “d/m/yy” )#</CFOUTPUT>

CFML Basics
In This Chapter
 Building a site architecture
 Using page templates
 Controlling the display
 Using databases to generate pages
 Outputting data
You may be surprised by the types of complex Web applications that
can be built by using basic ColdFusion concepts. You can use templates
to break each page into smaller segments, which not only helps keep your
code manageable but also allows you to make quick updates to your site.
The benefits of your templates can be maximized by storing content in a
database. The combination of templates and a database can help you build
large, content-rich sites with just a few ColdFusion pages.
Setting Up Your Page Architecture
Just like how an architect creates blueprints of a building before it’s con-
structed, a ColdFusion page can — and should — be planned out before it’s
built. To a Web designer, page architecture deals with how the elements of
the page lay out graphically. As the Web developer, you need to consider
how the CFML builds the page as well as the aesthetics of the final output.
Understanding template basics
The best way to think of a template is as a snippet of code that gets used
over and over again for a specific purpose. For example, suppose that a site
has several hundred products for sale. The product pages all generally look
the same. Only the product content changes. Rather than make several hun-
dred pages, all of which would look the same and contain 99 percent of the
same content, you could more easily use one page over and over again to

Setting Up Your Page Architecture
660
create each product page when that specific product is displayed. When you
break up your site into templates, you do the following:
✦Reduce the overall number of pages that you have to manage.
✦Reduce your maintenance burden because you can make a change to
one template and have it affect a large number of viewable pages on the
site.
Today, most high-traffic sites that have tens of thousands of Web pages,
such as www.cnn.com or www.yahoo.com, are driven by a surprisingly low
number of templates.
Determining just how to break a single ColdFusion Markup Language (CFML)
page into a series of templates can be more of an art than a science. One of
the most common ways to break up a page is shown in Figure 4-1.
The page is broken into four sections, all of which will be different templates:
✦Header: The area that appears at the very top of the page
✦Navigation: The area that includes links to the other pages in the site,
usually found on the left-hand side of the page
Figure 4-1:
Breaking a
single page
into multiple
templates.

Book VI
Chapter 4
Understanding
CFML Basics
Setting Up Your Page Architecture
661
✦Content: The area that includes most of the site content, generally
appearing to the right of the navigation area
✦Footer: The area that appears at the bottom of the page and usually
includes links, privacy information, and copyright information
Each section becomes an individual ColdFusion file and contains a mix of
HyperText Markup Language (HTML) and CFML. The most important thing
to remember is that after the page templates are put together, they need to
equal a properly formatted HTML page, with the correct number of <HEAD>,
<BODY>, <TABLE>, <TR>, and <TD> tags.
It may not seem all that helpful to break one page into four smaller template
pages, but the ability to reuse a piece of a page as a template gives you a lot
of options. For example, the footer is usually the same on every page of a
Web site. This makes it a great candidate to be extracted to a separate tem-
plate file. After you isolate the footer text in its own template file, you can
include it in as many pages as you like. Then, if you ever need to make a
change to the footer, you only need to change the footer template file, and
the footer will be automatically updated on all the pages that use the footer
template.
Using <CFINCLUDE>
The easiest way to build a single HTML page from several templates is with
the <CFINCLUDE> tag. You can use this tag in any ColdFusion page. Take a
quick look back at Figure 4-1. To create this page, we might have a page
called index.cfm, and within it, we’d use four <CFINCLUDE> tags to com-
pose the page. The tag takes the following form:
<CFINCLUDE TEMPLATE=”footer.cfm”>
The TEMPLATE attribute specifies the name and location of the footer file on
the ColdFusion server. The footer file, footer.cfm in this example, is also a
ColdFusion page and can use all the ColdFusion tags, functions, and variables
that are available in the main page (the page with the <CFINCLUDE> tag).
The contents of the file footer.cfm could look something like this (a stan-
dard copyright with a link to a copyright page):
<I>Copyright 2003, Your Fancy New Company.</I>
<A href=”copy_info.cfm”>All rights reserved</A>
The text of footer.cfm is actually quite simple because it’s used to print
only a single line on each page. Because this file will be included as part of
the larger page, it doesn’t need to be a complete HTML page, so you don’t

Using Conditional Processing
662
need to include <HTML> or <BODY> tags because those are included in the
file that originated the request for the template, which is as follows:
<HTML>
<BODY>
<!--- body of HTML page here --->
<CFINCLUDE TEMPLATE=”footer.cfm”>
</BODY>
</HTML>
Building static include files can save you time when it comes to building
and maintaining a site, but you can do a whole lot more with them! Each
template that’s included in the main page has access to all the variables,
functions, and queries of the main page. This allows you to create a footer
that uses CFML to generate dynamic output. For more information on how
to use variables and functions, check out Book VI, Chapter 5.
Another common way to use the <CFINCLUDE> tag is to isolate database
queries, user-defined functions, and other CFML templates. When a site is
controlled by a database, it’s very common to have each page use a query
(a request to a data source) to retrieve necessary information from the data-
base. (Queries are described in more detail later in this chapter.) Placing
queries in included templates has several distinct advantages:
✦They’re easier to work with during development. If your queries are
all in a common location and have descriptive terms in the filename
(qry_getproducts.cfm, for example), finding the right query to build
a page or edit becomes easier.
✦They’re easier to find for maintenance. A common development prac-
tice is to put your queries in a single location. This makes finding the
right query to work on substantially easier.
✦They’re easier to protect for security. Again, putting queries in a single
location external to your main ColdFusion pages makes them harder to
find for anyone who may try to get access to your databases by stealing
your queries.
Using Conditional Processing
Each ColdFusion Web application can receive information from a variety of
sources:
✦User action: A user clicks somewhere on a site.
✦User submitted forms: A user submits a form from the site.
✦Database queries: Data is retrieved from a database.

Book VI
Chapter 4
Understanding
CFML Basics
Using Conditional Processing
663
✦The Web application server: ColdFusion keeps information resident in
the server at all times and makes that information available to CFML.
✦E-mail servers: Yes, ColdFusion can interact with an e-mail server!
✦COM objects, JavaBeans, and Web services: These advanced serv-
ices can all pass information to CFML. For more information on these
advanced concepts, check out ColdFusion MX For Dummies, by John
Paul Ashenfelter and Jon Kocen (published by Wiley Publishing, Inc.).
The information received from these sources can be of varying degrees of
importance, and sometimes the information is not in a format that the end
user can understand. CFML gives you several ways to control the flow of
your page, based on the current set of information. Three of the most useful
flow control tags are <CFIF>, <CFELSE>, and <CFSWITCH>.
Using <CFIF> and <CFELSE>
The <CFIF> tag, which is the most common way to control the flow of a page
in CFML, is used in CFML in a way that’s very similar to how the word if is
used in English.
The <CFIF> tag is designed to test whether some condition is true or false.
This is a test expression. Any HTML or CFML between the <CFIF> tag and
the closing </CFIF> tag is to be evaluated if the test expression is TRUE.
Often two values in the test expression are compared with each other, as
you can see in the examples later in this section. Other times, the test expres-
sion is like those in Table 4-1, which shows some test expressions and their
meanings.
Table 4-1
Test Expressions
Expression
Meaning
Variables.first_name IS “Earl”
The variable first_name has a value
of “Earl”.
Form.quantity GT 10
The quantity field of the Web form is
greater than 10.
Day( Now() ) is 1
The current day of the month is 1.
Book VI, Chapter 5 provides more details on how functions and variables —
like those in Table 4-1 — work together.
If the expression is true, the code between the <CFIF> tags is processed. If it
is false, the code is skipped. In the following example, if the quantity in the
form element is greater than 10 — (GT) is code for greater than — the line
You qualify for the bulk discount. is displayed on the page:

Using Conditional Processing
664
<CFIF Form.quantity GT 10>
You qualify for the bulk discount.
</CFIF>
So, what happens if the user inputs a quantity that isn’t greater than 10? In
this case, nothing is displayed. Suppose, however, that you want to send a
different message if someone chooses fewer than ten items. In that case, you
can use the <CFELSE> tag, which allows you to set the alternative condition
to display if the <CFIF> condition isn’t true.
Take a look at the following code snippet, which shows how you can con-
struct a <CFELSE> element within your <CFIF> tag (the stuff in between the
<!--- and the ---> are code comments to help you understand the flow of
the code):
<CFIF Form.quantity GT 10>
<!--- first option --->
You qualify for the bulk discount.
<CFELSE> 
<!--- second option --->
If you buy 10 items, you will qualify for the bulk discount.
</CFIF>
You might think of the <CFIF>-<CFELSE>-</CFIF> combination as, “If the
test expression is true, do the first option, or else do the second option.”
Only one option can happen — the first or the second but never both.
Using <CFELSEIF>
If you need to test more than one condition, you can use <CFELSE> or
<CFELSEIF> to extend the basic <CFIF> tag. Suppose that you have a Web
form that asks for the user’s age. The form passes the age information to the
ColdFusion server processing in a variable, which can be tested before
printing the proper response. The <CFELSEIF> tag allows you to insert
more test expressions into the logic structure:
<CFIF Form.age LT 13>
<!--- first option --->
You are too young to place an order.
<CFELSEIF Form.age LT 18>
<!--- second  option --->
You must have parental permission before ordering.
<CFELSEIF Form.age GT 59>
<!--- third option --->
You qualify for the Senior Discount.
<CFELSE> 
<!--- last option --->
Thank you for your order.
</CFIF>

Book VI
Chapter 4
Understanding
CFML Basics
Using Conditional Processing
665
Again, only a single option will be executed. If the user is under 13, the first
option will be printed, and all the other tags will be skipped. If the user is not
under 13, the next expression is checked. Each expression is checked, in
order, until one evaluates to true. Only if none of the expressions are true
will the <CFELSE> option be run. Note: When one test is met, the following
conditions are not even checked: There is no need.
You don’t need to have a <CFELSE> tag, but it’s a good idea to include
one every time that you use a <CFELSEIF> tag. Even if you don’t think the
<CFELSE> tag will ever be executed, it can be a useful error-tracking tool.
Using <CFSWITCH>
Sometimes you need to be able to handle a lot of different situations in a
single page. The <CFSWITCH> tag compares a single test expression with a
series of cases that are indicated by <CFCASE> tags and then executes the
one that returns TRUE. Suppose that you need to apply special shipping
and/or tax rates depending on the state from which an order originates.
This is a good candidate for the <CFSWITCH> tag because one variable,
#Form.State#, needs to be compared against a bunch of different state
abbreviations.
Here’s how the code could be represented for a selection of states:
<CFSWITCH EXPRESSION=”#Form.State#”>
<CFCASE value=”CA”>
8% tax for orders within California.
</CFCASE>
<CFCASE value=”NY”>
6% tax for orders shipped to New York.
</CFCASE>
<CFCASE value=”AK,HI”>
$10 additional shipping for orders shipped to Alaska and Hawaii.
</CFCASE>
<CFDEFAULTCASE>
Standard shipping rules apply.
</CFDEFAULTCASE>
</CFSWITCH>
Adding additional cases to the switch tag is as easy, and you can have as
many as you want. The <CFDEFAULTCASE> tag is usually put at the end, and
it occurs when none of the other cases are met. Note that you can have more
than one value, separated by commas, which represents a specific case.
As your sites get more complex, you’ll want to focus more on using
<CFSWITCH> and <CFCASE>. ColdFusion processes these commands more
quickly than <CFIF> and <CFELSE>, and as a result, using these will make
your site run more quickly.

Using SQL Queries
666
Using SQL Queries
Databases can be a powerful addition to your Web development toolbox.
Whether you’re storing customer information, Web site content, or docu-
ment metadata (a description of some kind of data), a database gives you a
way to store, retrieve, and modify your data. For more information on using
databases with ColdFusion, check out Book VI, Chapter 6.
Many people are familiar with database concepts, even if they don’t know it.
The table structure of a spreadsheet is a lot like a table in a database. Each
table in a database is given a unique name, and it has columns and rows that
hold data. All the columns have the same type of information, and each row
holds a set of information about a particular entity. Table 4-2 below shows a
sample customer database table. Each row corresponds to a different cus-
tomer, and each column holds a single kind of data.
Table 4-2

The CustomerID column is an example of a Identity Key. Each time that a
record is added to the database, the database automatically assigns a
CustomerID to the new record. The new CustomerID will not be the same
as any other CustomerID in the database. Having a unique identifier not
only keeps your database running at optimal speed, but it also helps you
manage the data. (If you don’t know how to set up a unique key in your
database, check with a database administrator or check your database
documentation.)
Exploring SQL concepts
Asking a database to give you information is a query. Database queries use a
Structured Query Language (SQL). Through queries, you can read, write,
and modify data in your database. Consider the following SQL query:
SELECT firstname, lastname FROM Employees
WHERE lastname=’Smith’
This query has several elements:

Book VI
Chapter 4
Understanding
CFML Basics
Using SQL Queries
667
✦SQL elements: These items describe actions, conditions, restrictions,
and locations. They include the SELECT, FROM, and WHERE clauses.
✦Columns: In this case, firstname and lastname are columns within a
table. This is the data that you’re interested in retrieving.
✦Tables: Here, Employees is a table that includes the columns firstname
and lastname.
So, in sum, the query effectively states, “Select the firstname and lastname
from the Employees table in the database, where the lastname is equal to
Smith.”
Table 4-3 shows some other basic SQL queries and what they do.

WHERE CustomerID = 3
Entire books are dedicated to SQL, and we can only begin to scratch the sur-
face here. Macromedia has put a lot of effort into making SQL easy by adding
query editors to Dreamweaver, so you can get the most out of your data-
base without getting bogged down in SQL syntax. For the database tools of
Dreamweaver to function properly, you need to be sure your database is set
up properly in the ColdFusion Administrator. (See Book VI, Chapter 2 for
more information on the ColdFusion Administrator. In addition, check out
Book VI, Chapter 6 for more about using SQL.)
Wondering what that asterisk (*) is in that second SQL statement in Table 4-3?
The asterisk (*) is a wildcard in SQL terminology. If you use a * following a
SELECT statement, it will retrieve data from all the columns in the table that
you specify in the FROM clause.
Pick up a copy of SQL For Dummies, 5th Edition, by Allen G. Taylor (published
by Wiley Publishing, Inc.) for an easy-to-understand, comprehensive guide
to the SQL language.

Using SQL Queries
668
Using <CFQUERY>
ColdFusion has a special tag for running SQL queries: <CFQUERY>. The
attributes that you specify in the <CFQUERY> tag tell ColdFusion what data-
base to connect to and how to connect to it. The body of the <CFQUERY> tag
contains the SQL that you want to run. Some of the important attributes of
the <CFQUERY> tag are listed in Table 4-4. The basic format for CFQUERY is
listed here:
<CFQUERY name=”MyQuery” datasource=”SomeDatasource”>
INSERT YOUR SQL HERE
</CFQUERY>
Table 4-4
Common Attributes of the <CFQUERY> Tag
Attribute
Description
name
Required: The name you use to refer to this query in CFML.
datasource
Required: The name used to register the database in the ColdFusion
Administrator.
username
Optional: Specifies the username used to log on to the data source.
password
Optional: Specifies the password used to log on to the data source.
maxRows
Optional: Limits the number of rows returned by the query.
timeout
Optional: Gives the time, in seconds, that the ColdFusion server should
wait for a response from the data source before generating an error.
If all the attributes are set up correctly and the ColdFusion server can con-
nect and communicate with the data source, the <CFQUERY> tag will provide
you with a set of data from the data source. All this data will be available to
you to use in your pages in the form of variables. Check out Book VI, Chap-
ter 5 for more information on using variables from queries.
Using SQL commands
SQL provides you with a powerful way to get information out of a database.
SQL is the predominant language for Web development, and although a com-
plete primer on it is beyond the scope of this book, we want to give you an
introduction to some of the critical SQL statements that will enable you to
get data from a database.
Creating queries with SELECT
The SELECT keyword is used to retrieve rows of data from a database, and it
is always the first word in a SELECT statement. Following the SELECT keyword
is the list of columns that you want to retrieve data from. If you want data
from all of the columns in a table, use an asterisk (*) instead of specific

Book VI
Chapter 4
Understanding
CFML Basics
Using SQL Queries
669
column names. The last required element of a SELECT statement is the name
of the table FROM which the data is being retrieved.
Each of the following examples selects a different set of columns from each
row of the Customers table:
✦SELECT Name FROM Customers
✦SELECT CustomerID, Name FROM Customers
✦SELECT * FROM Customers
What if you don’t want data from every row? The WHERE clause is used to
filter rows from a query. The following examples use the WHERE clause to
restrict the rows being returned:
✦SELECT Name FROM Customers WHERE CustomerID = 2
✦SELECT CustomerID, Name FROM Customers WHERE PostalCode >
94000
With the aid of the WHERE clause, you can build queries that retrieve only
the information that you need to build your page. While looping through the
query or outputting directly to the screen, each column can be accessed as
a variable by using pound signs, such as #name# or #CustomerID#. The use
of pound signs to output a variable is described in more detail in Book VI,
Chapter 5.
If you find that you use <CFIF> to filter the data generated by <CFQUERY>,
consider modifying the SQL to do the filtering for you. The database will
probably be able to process the filter faster, plus you won’t need to transfer
useless information between servers.
Creating queries with DELETE
The DELETE keyword is extremely powerful because it can remove all the
data from a table in one fell swoop. To delete all the rows from a table, simply
issue the following query, where tablename is the name of the table:
DELETE tablename
Although the above statement will work in Microsoft SQL Server 2000 and
MySQL, it won’t work in Microsoft Access because Access doesn’t support
all SQL syntax. It uses a limited version of SQL called Jet SQL. For informa-
tion on which SQL keywords are supported, check out the Microsoft Access
Help files.
More often than not, you’ll only want to delete a limited number of rows . . . or
maybe only one row. You can filter the DELETE command by using the WHERE

Using SQL Queries
670
clause, as we describe in the previous section, “Creating queries with
SELECT.” The following examples use this technique:
✦DELETE Customers WHERE CustomerID = 2
✦DELETE Customers WHERE PostalCode = 94110
Your DELETE commands should always have a WHERE clause — this will keep
you from accidentally deleting important data. Because it’s so easy to delete
data by mistake, some developers recommend never deleting data at all. By
adding a status column, you can mark each record as active or inactive and
then do periodic maintenance to remove inactive records by hand.
Creating queries with INSERT
Inserting data into a table is probably the toughest of the basic database
operations. The elements of the command are similar to the SELECT state-
ment. After the INSERT keyword, you give the table name, followed by a list
of columns in parentheses. However, unlike a SELECT command, from which
the database sends you data, now you need to send the data to the data-
base. The information for the new row is placed at the end of the insert
statement with the VALUES keyword, as in the following example:
INSERT INTO Customers( Name, Address, PostalCode ) VALUES
(“Chris”, “44 South St.”, 06810 )
The order of the data after the VALUES keyword must match the order of the
columns listed before the VALUES keyword.
If you have a column that is automatically generated, such as an ID column,
you don’t need to specify a value for that column.
Creating queries with UPDATE
Another powerful action is UPDATE. Without a WHERE clause, the UPDATE
command updates every row in the data table, which is not usually what
you want. The syntax of the UPDATE command starts off with the UPDATE
keyword and the name of the data table, just like the INSERT command.
However, rather than listing the columns and values separately, the value
of each column is SET individually, as in the following example:
UPDATE Customers SET name=’Margaret’ WHERE CustomerID = 3
When the UPDATE command is running, the filter is applied first, and then
the rows are modified. This means that you can modify a column that was
used in the WHERE clause without affecting the results. The following SQL
works just fine, changing customers’ name from Maggie to Margaret.
UPDATE Customers SET Name=’Margaret’ WHERE Name = ‘Maggie’

Outputting Content to the Screen
When you build a page in ColdFusion, you have data from Web forms, data-
base queries, and other sources stored in variables. Some of these variables
may hold data that you want to display to your users. The <CFOUTPUT> tag
gives you the ability to put data from variables into HTML. The <CFOUTPUT>
tag can print a single value, or it can be used to loop through the data in a
query, displaying multiple rows of data with just one tag.
Using <CFOUTPUT>
Each <CFOUTPUT> tag must have a closing </CFOUTPUT> tag. Between the
tags, you can place HTML or CFML. When you place a variable name between
pound signs (#), <CFOUTPUT> displays the value of the variable and not the
variable name.
<CFSET animal=”badger”>
<CFOUTPUT>
My <I>favorite</I> animal is the <B>#animal#.</B>
</CFOUTPUT>
This CFML snippet would print the text: “My favorite animal is the badger.”
Exactly how you set up the tag is a matter of style. The following example
prints the same text, but most developers find the nested tags to be less
clear:
<CFSET animal=”badger”>
My <I>favorite</I> animal is the <B><CFOUTPUT>#animal#.</CFOUTPUT></B>
Looping
The <CFOUTPUT> tag can do a lot more than just print a single variable. When
you specify a query in <CFOUTPUT>, the text between the opening and clos-
ing tags is repeated for each row of the query, as in the following example:
<CFQUERY name=”CustomerData” datasource=”CustomerDB”>
SELECT * FROM Customers
<CFQUERY>
<CFOUTPUT query=”CustomerData”>
Customer #CustomerID# is named #name#.<BR>
</CFOUTPUT>
The columns from the query are available inside the <CFOUTPUT>, just like
ordinary variables. However, every time the <CFOUTPUT> tag loops, a new
row of data is used, so the values of each column change. If the query
returned three rows of data, the <CFOUTPUT> tag would loop three times
and print three lines of text.

A
fter you’ve gotten your feet wet with the basics of ColdFusion MX 6.1
Developer Edition, it won’t be long before you’re itching to add even
more functionality to your site. This chapter is designed to give you an intro-
duction to some of the more advanced concepts in ColdFusion. In reality,
working with variables, parameters, and data structures (collections of data
in various forms) are concepts that are common to any technology platform.
This just happens to be Macromedia’s implementation, and as you’ll soon find
out, the folks at Macromedia tried to make it as easy as possible to pick up.
Working with Variables and Parameters
If you’ve ever logged on to a Web site by entering a username and password,
you’ve probably seen a URL that looked something like this:
http://www.somesite.com/index.cfm?userID=123456
In that URL string, the userID is called the variable and 123456 is the value
for that variable. Put simply, a variable is a value that can change, depend-
ing upon differing conditions within your site. In ColdFusion, a parameter
can represent one of many different data types that are supported in the
product, such as variables, queries, arrays, and even dates.
More often than not, variables are used by developers to change the way a
Web page looks or responds to a user’s input. In ColdFusion, variables can
come from a variety of sources and appear in a variety of different formats.
Variables can be created in ColdFusion in four different ways:
✦By using <CFSET> or <CFPARAM> tags
✦As a result of a database query using a <CFQUERY> tag

Working with Variables and Parameters
674
✦Automatically by ColdFusion
✦From within a <CFSCRIPT> tag
CFScript is scripting language that is similar to JavaScript and is available to
developers from within CFML. Getting into detail about CFScript is beyond
the scope of this book, but to find out more about it, check out ColdFusion
MX For Dummies, by John Paul Ashenfelter and Jon Kocen (published by
Wiley Publishing, Inc.).
The best reason to use variables in your site is that they expand your ability
to deliver the right content for the right situation dynamically. In this sec-
tion, we show you how you can begin to use variables to enhance the user
experience on your site. For a review of variable type and scope, refer to
Book VI, Chapter 3.
In addition to this tutorial and reference, you can also refer to the Using
ColdFusion Help files, accessible from within Dreamweaver MX 2004 by
pressing Ctrl+F1. The Help files are an exceptionally good reference tool
to understanding both the type and scope of variables.
Creating variables with <CFSET>
The most common way to create a variable in ColdFusion is by using a
<CFSET> tag. With <CFSET>, you create the name of the variable, as well
as the value (called an expression). The syntax for the <CFSET> tag is as
follows:
<CFSET VariableName = “expression”>
The following example shows you how you can use <CFSET> with the
sample ColdFusion databases that come with Macromedia Studio MX 2004
to retrieve some information about an employee:
1. In Dreamweaver, verify that you have a connection to the
CompanyInfo database by opening the Application panel and
selecting the Databases tab.
To open the Applications panel, select Window➪Databases. You should
see the three default databases, as shown in Figure 5-1. If you can’t see
them, then you need to configure your database connections. For
instructions on how to do this, check out Book VI, Chapter 2.
2. Create a new ColdFusion file by choosing File➪New and selecting
Dynamic Page and ColdFusion from the Category and Dynamic Page
columns, respectively. Click Create to create the file.

Book VI
Chapter 5
Variable, Functions,
and Structured Data
Working with Variables and Parameters
675
3. Create a variable called EmployeeNumber and give it a value of 1.
Constants are the simplest form of variables because there’s no real
variation in them. In the Code view, your code should look as follows:
<CFSET EmployeeNumber = “1”>
There are a number of rules for the naming of variables. The two most
important rules are that variables should not start with a number and
that they cannot contain spaces. For a complete set of variable naming
rules, check out the Using ColdFusion Help files in Dream-weaver by
choosing Help➪Using ColdFusion, and then choosing Developing
ColdFusion Applications➪Using ColdFusion Variables➪
Creating Variables➪Variable Naming Rules.
4. Expand the CompanyInfo database until you see the Employee table.
You can expand the database to the table level by clicking the plus
box (+) next to the database and then next to the tables.
If you want to see the data in the Employee table, right-click the table
name and choose View Data from the contextual menu.
5. Create a query in the Code view to the CompanyInfo database
to get all information from the Employee table where emp_ID =
EmployeeNumber.
Figure 5-1:
You should
see three
active
databases.

Working with Variables and Parameters
676
Your query should look like this:
<CFQUERY datasource=”CompanyInfo” name=”GetEmployees”>
SELECT * FROM employee
WHERE emp_ID=#EmployeeNumber#
</CFQUERY>
You’ll notice something interesting is happening here. Within the query,
we’ve included the EmployeeNumber variable. Because ColdFusion reads
code from the top of the page to the bottom, the server first reads that
there’s a variable called EmployeeNumber and it has a value of 1. Then,
when it reads this query, it swaps out #EmployeeNumber# with the
value (1) that was previously set for the variable.
6. Output the data to the screen using a <CFOUTPUT> tag.
If you want to see what the query returns, you need to include a
<CFOUTPUT> tag, as follows:
<CFOUTPUT query=”GetEmployees”>#firstname#
#lastname#<BR>#startdate#<BR>#salary#</CFOUTPUT>
7. Press F12 to preview the page.
You should get a look at the personnel information of one Ben Frueh, as
shown in Figure 5-2.
Testing the existence of variables with <CFPARAM>
The <CFPARAM> tag is an interesting ColdFusion tag because it checks for the
existence and type of a local variable on a page. Depending upon whether
that variable exists and what type of variable it is, ColdFusion either creates
a new variable, gives it a default value, or generates an error. The <CFPARAM>
tag has three elements:
✦name: The name of the variable
✦type: The data type of the variable, such as a number, string, array,
query, and so on
✦default: The default value for a variable
Figure 5-2:
Ben Frueh,
Employee
Number = 1.

Book VI
Chapter 5
Variable, Functions,
and Structured Data
Working with Variables and Parameters
677
The structure for the tag is as follows:
<CFPARAM name=”SomeName” type=”DataType” default=”Value”>
The only value that’s required for the <CFPARAM> tag is name. If you use only
the name, the tag tests for the existence of a variable with that name. If it
does not exist, ColdFusion returns an error message, as shown in Figure 5-3,
and stops processing. If you include type with the name in the tag, then
ColdFusion requires both the name and the corresponding data type for the
variable to exist, or it generates an error. Finally, you can choose to include
just the name and the default values. In this case, if no variable exists when
the page is processed, ColdFusion creates the variable with the default value.
Suppose that you’ve got a product page on your corporate site. On this
product page, you want to be able to show products specific to your various
target audiences: consumers, educators, and the government. To accom-
plish this, you include a form on the product page that asks users to select
whether they want to view education or government products.
Figure 5-3:
This
variable
does not
exist.

Working with Variables and Parameters
678
Because a user won’t be choosing a product type until they reach the prod-
uct page, you can use <CFPARAM> to evaluate whether or not a variable exists
to show specific product information based on a form input. Here’s a simple
way to do it:
1. In Dreamweaver, create a new page called param.cfm and save it
locally or on a remote testing server (wherever you have the
ColdFusion server running).
2. Create a <CFPARAM> called type and give it an empty default value, as
follows:
<CFPARAM name=”type” default=””>
While it’s not required, it’s always a good idea to scope your variables.
That way, you’re less likely to run into any errors as ColdFusion looks
for the right scope for the variable you’re testing. Scoping is also cov-
ered in more detail in Book VI, Chapter 3. So in the previous example, if
you scoped the variable, it would look as follows:
<CFPARAM name=”FORM.type” default=””>
Adding this tag first is critical, because farther down the page, you need
to look for the variable type. This tag ensures that the variable exists,
whether or not someone has selected a product type from the drop-
down list.
When this exercise is complete, try removing this line to see what hap-
pens when the variable isn’t defined. ColdFusion will generate an error
and tell you that the variable isn’t defined when you first load the page.
3. Create a drop-down list that allows a user to select a product type.
Here’s a simple version of what that form element looks like:
<FORM action=”param.cfm” method=”post”>
<SELECT name=”type”>
<OPTION value=””>Select One</OPTION>
<OPTION value=”consumer”>Consumer</OPTION>
<OPTION value=”education”>Education</OPTION>
<OPTION value=”government”>Government</OPTION>
</SELECT>
<INPUT type=”submit” value=”Go”>
</FORM>
4. Evaluate whether the variable type exists and show the product infor-
mation based on the variable value.
The most straightforward way to do this is to use <CFIF> and 
<CFELSEIF>, as shown here:
<CFIF type is “consumer”>
<UL>
<LI>Consumer Product One</LI>
<LI>Consumer Product Two</LI>

Book VI
Chapter 5
Variable, Functions,
and Structured Data
Working with Variables and Parameters
679
</UL>
<CFELSEIF type is “education”>
<UL>
<LI>Education Product One</LI>
<LI>Education Product Two</LI>
</UL>
<CFELSEIF type is “government”>
<UL>
<LI>Government Product One</LI>
<LI>Government Product Two</LI>
</UL>
</CFIF>
Refer to Book VI, Chapter 4 on the variety of ways you can use <CFIF> and
<CFELSEIF> to evaluate conditional statements.
You can also use <CFSWITCH> and <CFCASE> for this very same example.
Indeed, as your applications become more complex, you’ll want to use
<CFSWITCH> and <CFCASE>, because they process faster, even if <CFIF>
and <CFELSE> are easier concepts to understand. <CFSWITCH> is covered
in Book VI, Chapter 4.
Getting access to variables through <CFQUERY>
Consider the query that we use in the variable example in the section,
“Creating variables with <CFSET>”:
<CFQUERY datasource=”CompanyInfo” name=”GetEmployees”>
SELECT * FROM employee
WHERE emp_ID=#EmployeeNumber#
</CFQUERY>
This query returns information from all the columns in the employee table,
namely
✦FirstName
✦
Salary
✦LastName
✦
Contract
✦Dept_ID
✦
emp_ID
✦StartDate
Each of these columns becomes a variable that can be output to the screen
using a <CFOUTPUT> tag. To use them, surround the column name with
pound signs (#). So, for example, to output FirstName, you would use
#FirstName#.

Using CFML Functions
680
Using variables generated by ColdFusion
ColdFusion generates a variety of variables that you can use in your applica-
tions. These variables work just like variables that you create, and they’re
called in a similar fashion. For example, if you want to show the operating
system of the server that ColdFusion is running on, you can use the follow-
ing resident variable (meaning it’s active in ColdFusion at all times):
<CFOUTPUT>#Server.OS.Name#</CFOUTPUT>
For a complete listing of these resident variables that ColdFusion generates,
check out the CFML reference guide in the Using ColdFusion Help files,
accessible by pressing Ctrl+F1 within Dreamweaver.
Using CFML Functions
Hundreds of different functions are available to ColdFusion developers,
and they do everything from creating a date to generating random numbers.
Although there are numerous ColdFusion functions, nearly all of them do
one of the following four things:
✦Create new data and data structures
✦Evaluate some type of data to determine its existence or format
✦Evaluate some type of data to produce some new type of data
✦Change the composition of some type of data
To give you some idea of the breadth of functions that are available,
Macromedia puts them into 17 different categories (plus an Other category),
with many functions being represented in more than one category. We list
all these categories in Table 5-1, as well as provide a brief description of the
kinds of functions found in each group.

Functions can be called in a few different ways:
✦As part of a CFML tag: An example of this kind of function is IsDefined,
which checks to see if a variable is defined. The IsDefined function
looks like this:
<CFIF IsDefined(“SomeVariable”)>
✦As part of defining a variable: An example of this kind of function is
arrayNew(n), which creates an array (a collection of data) in n dimen-
sions. The arrayNew function is called from within a <CFSET> tag, as
follows:
<CFSET MyArray = arrayNew(1)>
✦When outputting a variable: An example of this kind of function is
DateFormat, which enables you to change the way the date looks.
DateFormat can be called as follows, where date is a variable that
represents a date:
#DateFormat(date, “mm-dd-yyyy”)#

Using CFML Functions
682
✦From within another function: It’s not uncommon that functions sup-
port calling other functions to provide some value. Take the following
example:
<CFSET discountprice = DollarFormat(Evaluate(price -
(price * discount))) >
In this case, we are setting a variable discountprice, using the
DollarFormat function, and within that function, using the Evaluate
function to perform some basic arithmetic functions.
Going through each of the ColdFusion functions is beyond the scope of this
book, but the following sections show you how to get started with the five
most useful ColdFusion functions for beginners.
Using the arrayNew function
The arrayNew function, as you might expect from the name, creates a
new array. Arrays, which are collections of data, are a great way to capture
information and then redisplay it or manipulate it before committing it to a
database.
The syntax for arrayNew is as follows:
<CFSET AnArray = arrayNew(n)>
Using <CFSET> is the most common way to create an array. AnArray is the
variable that represents the elements of the array. arrayNew creates the array
and (n) represents the number of dimensions (dimensions specify the struc-
ture of the data) of the array. ColdFusion supports up to three-dimensional
arrays. Figure 5-4 shows a graphical representation of an array in ColdFusion.
Building arrays is covered in more detail in the section, “Casting Data into
Arrays, Lists, and Structures,” later in this chapter.
Figure 5-4:

arrayNew
function

Chapter 5
Variable, Functions,
and Structured Data
Using CFML Functions
683
Using the isDefined function
The isDefined function is one of the most popular ColdFusion functions
because it works so nicely in conditional statements, especially the <CFIF>
tag. The syntax for the function looks like this:
<CFIF isDefined(“someVariable”)>
This function returns a value of TRUE or FALSE, depending upon whether the
variable is defined when the page is being processed. In the example code
above, if the value returned is TRUE, then whatever immediately follows that
<CFIF> will be executed. If it returns a FALSE value, then the code immedi-
ately following the <CFIF> will be not be executed.
It’s quite common to use this function for validating and processing forms.
After the user submits the form, you can use isDefined to ensure that all
required fields have been filled out. Alternatively, isDefined can be used to
instigate some action — updating a database, for example — if a value exists
for the form field submitted.
Using the len function
Developers love to use the len (length) function. len is an incredibly
simple function, in that all it does is return the length of a string. Much like
isDefined, this function becomes exceptionally valuable when doing error
handling and processing because if you’re looking for a variable that should
be of at least some length and len returns a value of zero, you immediately
know that the user hasn’t filled in the field or made a selection from a menu.
Used as part of a <CFIF> statement, the syntax for len is as follows:
<CFIF len(string) is not 0>
Using the DateFormat function
Everybody likes to use dates in their Web sites. The DateFormat function in
ColdFusion allows you to take a date and format it in a variety of ways. To
output today’s date in mm-dd-yyyy format, you’d use the following:
<CFOUTPUT>#dateformat(Now(), “mm-dd-yyyy”)#</CFOUTPUT>
Incidentally, Now() is a related function that provides you with the server’s
current date and time. You can format the date in a number of different ways
using month, date, and year. Here are the basics:
✦d: Day of the month, but single digit days aren’t preceded by a zero (1, 2,
and 13, for example).
✦dd: Day of the month, and single digit days are preceded by a zero (01,
06, and 23, for example).

Casting Data into Arrays, Lists, and Structures
684
✦ddd: A three-letter abbreviation for day of the week (such as Mon, Tue,
and Wed).
✦dddd: The full name of the day of the week.
✦m: Month of the year, but single digit months aren’t preceded by a zero
(such as 1, 6, and 11).
✦mm: Month of the year, and single digit months are preceded by a zero
(01, 04, and 10, for example).
✦mmm: The month as a three-letter abbreviation (such as Jan, Mar, and Oct).
✦mmmm: The full name of the month.
✦y: The year as last two digits, but only one digit for years ending lower
than 10 (1, 5, and 23, for example).
✦yy: The year as last two digits (such as 01, 08, and 98).
✦yyyy: The year represented by four digits (1998, 2002, and 2014, for
example).
Some similar functions to DateFormat are worth checking out in the CFML
Reference, which you can get to by pressing Ctrl+F1 in Dreamweaver. They
include TimeFormat, CreateDate, Now, and NumberFormat.
Using the Trim function
Trim is another exceptionally simple, but often used and valuable function.
Trim removes any leading spaces from either side of data in a string. This is
most useful, for example, when processing searches from text form fields,
because you can strip out the spaces in a text field entry like “new homes”
to create a search string that could look like “newhomes.” Here’s how the
function looks when used to set a variable that comes from a form:
<CFSET HomeSearch = trim(form.HomeType)>
In the preceding example, the HomeType form input will have any leading or
trailing spaces removed, and the resulting input will be assigned to the vari-
able HomeSearch.
In addition to Trim, there are also two related functions, Ltrim and Rtrim.
These functions, as you might expect, remove spacing from the left or the
right of a string value.
Casting Data into Arrays, Lists, and Structures
In the course of building a dynamic Web site, you will oftentimes find your-
self looking for different ways to use structured datasets — collections of data
that fit a predefined structure. These datasets can be used for a variety of

Book VI
Chapter 5
Variable, Functions,
and Structured Data
Casting Data into Arrays, Lists, and Structures
685
activities, such as populating form elements, creating name/value pairs for
things like link-text navigation, or even creating altogether new data struc-
tures. To help facilitate the use of structured datasets, ColdFusion has three
different kinds of tools available to developers:
✦Lists: Lists are simple collections of a number of items.
✦Arrays: Arrays are sets of structured data that can be like a structured
list, like a spreadsheet (with rows and columns), or an even more com-
plex configuration.
✦Structures: Structures are collections of related data that are put
together in a virtual container of sorts to make them easier to use.
This section covers when and how you can add each of these different ele-
ments to your dynamic Web site.
All these data structures support the use of queries to populate them. For
more information on how to query a database, check out Book VI, Chapter 3.
Creating lists
Lists allow you to take single sets of structured data and output them to a
Web page. You can create a list in ColdFusion in two ways:
✦Using a <CFLOOP> tag
✦Using the ListAppend function
Creating a list with <CFLOOP> is the more common method, but we cover
both techniques.
Using <CFLOOP> to run through a list
To create a simple list using <CFLOOP>, just follow these steps:
1. Create a <CFLOOP> tag in Code view of your ColdFusion document.
The tag should look like this: <CFLOOP></CFLOOP>.
2. Within the <CFLOOP> tag, create a variable using the index parameter.
Call this variable MyList, which would make the open tag look like
<CFLOOP index=”MyList”>.
3. Create your list using the list parameter.
The list has to be a separated group of values. You use the list param-
eter to specify the list. The default item delimiter is a comma. Creating a
list of some of the contributing authors of this book would look like this:
<CFLOOP index=”ListElement” list=”Damon Dean,Andy
Cowitt,Ellen Finkelstein”>

Casting Data into Arrays, Lists, and Structures
686
The default delimiter is a comma, but you can use the delimiters param-
eter to specify different delimiters, such as the colon. To create the same
list as in Step 3 with a colon (:) as a delimiter, just use this code:
<CFLOOP index=”ListElement” delimiters=”:” list=”Damon
Dean:Andy Cowitt: Ellen Finkelstein”>
4. To view the list, add a <CFOUTPUT> tag within the <CFLOOP> tags and
call the variable.
Figure 5-5 shows the resulting output, and here’s the code:
<CFLOOP index=”MyList” list=”Damon Dean, Andy Cowitt,
Ellen Finkelstein”>
<CFOUTPUT>#MyList#<BR></CFOUTPUT></CFLOOP>
5. Press F12 to view your list.
You can also use the results of a query to populate a list using <CFLOOP>.
Consider the following query of the sample CompanyInfo database:
<CFQUERY datasource=”CompanyInfo” name=”GetEmployees”>
SELECT firstname FROM employee</CFQUERY>
Now, if your <CFLOOP> tag looks as follows, you can generate a list of the
first names of all the company’s employees as a loop:
<CFLOOP query=”GetEmployees”>
<CFOUTPUT>#firstname#<BR></CFOUTPUT>
</CFLOOP>
Using ListAppend to create a list
Creating a list with the ListAppend function is a more advanced and
dynamic way of creating a list. This quick example shows you how to do it:
1. Create a variable using <CFSET> and give it the first value of your list.
You can use the same variables and lists from the previous example:
<CFSET MyList = “Damon Dean”>
Figure 5-5:

this book!

and Structured Data

2. Append the list by using ListAppend and <CFSET>.
ListAppend asks you to specify the list, and then add the new value.
So the code would look as follows:
<CFSET MyList = ListAppend(Mylist, “Andy Cowitt”)
3. To output the new list, create an output tag and call the new MyList
variable.
Your code should look similar to this:
<CFOUTPUT>#Mylist#</CFOUPUT>
4. Press F12 in Dreamweaver to preview your work.
You should see the names Damon Dean, Andy Cowitt, and Ellen

Arrays are, very simply, structured datasets. These datasets can exist in n
number of dimensions. A one-dimensional array looks surprisingly similar to
a list. A two-dimensional array is akin to a spreadsheet. A three-dimensional
array is, well, complicated, but if you can imagine data with height, width and
depth, then you’d pretty much have the concept. While they’re possible,
don’t even ask about four-dimensional arrays, in part because they’re really
tough to conceptualize, and because ColdFusion only supports up to three-
dimensional arrays.
Creating an array
Creating basic arrays is a fairly straightforward proposition. If you want to
create an array with some of the jobs related to the creation of this book,
here’s how you could do it:
1. Use the ArrayNew function to create an array and give it a dimension.
To keep things simple, use a one-dimensional array, so the code looks
like this:
<CFSET BookJobs= ArrayNew(1)>
2. Add items to the array using <CFSET>.
When adding items to the new array, you use the <CFSET> and then the
array name to first specify the array, and then integers enclosed in brack-
ets to specify to which element in the array you’re going to be assigning
a value.

Casting Data into Arrays, Lists, and Structures
688
If the value is a string, you also need to make sure that the array value is
enclosed in quotes. If it’s another variable, the quotes aren’t needed.
For this example, you are using strings, so the code looks like this:
<CFSET BookJobs[1] = “Writer”>
3. Fill out the remaining items in your array.
Add a few more jobs to complete the array. Here’s the remainder of the
list:
<CFSET BookJobs[2] = “Editor”>
<CFSET BookJobs[3] = “Production Manager”>
<CFSET BookJobs[4] = “Copywriter”>
<CFSET BookJobs[5] = “Illustrator”>
4. Add a <CFDUMP> tag to the bottom of the array and output the array
to the screen by pressing F12.
The <CFDUMP> tag outputs variables to the screen. It’s exceptionally
handy for debugging your code. When you add the <CFDUMP> tag, you
need to specify the variable you want to dump. So in this case, the code
would look as follows:
<CFDUMP var=”#BookJobs#”>
5. Press F12, and you should get a screen that looks a lot like Figure 5-6.
Be sure to remove the <CFDUMP> tag when you’re finalizing your code,
otherwise you’ll have that lingering output of your array structure.
If you want to see an individual item in an array, such as the Copywriter
position, you would use the following syntax:
<CFOUTPUT>I was the #BookJobs[4]# for Macromedia Studio MX
2004 All-in-One Desk Reference For Dummies</CFOUTPUT>
Using an array
Now that you’ve created an array, you can do something more with it than
just dump it to the screen. A common use for one-dimensional arrays is to
populate lists in form elements. In the following example, you create a drop-
down list using the elements from an array:
Figure 5-6:
Hooray for

Variable, Functions,
and Structured Data

1. Create a new file entitled inc_array.cfm and include the array infor-
mation from the previous example in it.
Figure 5-7 shows what the code and filename should look like on your
screen in Dreamweaver. We put this in a separate file so that it can be
made available to other forms on the site that might need the same list,
and so that, if we ever need to update that array, we would only need to
do it in one location.
2. In a new document, create an include tag to include the array.
A CFML tag for this very purpose is called <CFINCLUDE>. With the
<CFINCLUDE> tag, you specify a file that will have its contents swapped
in for the tag when the page is processed by the ColdFusion server. In
this case, we call a template, which is just a reference to another file.
Here’s what it looks like:
<CFINCLUDE template=”inc_array.cfm”>
3. Convert the array to a list.
At present, the array is still just a single comma-separated collection
of information. Before it can be output to the screen, it needs to be
broken down into its individual elements. To do this, use a function
Figure 5-7:
Your
inc_array
file.

Casting Data into Arrays, Lists, and Structures
690
called ArraytoList. With ArraytoList, you can specify an array and a
delimiter (optional), and the function creates a new variable as a list.
Here’s the code:
<CFSET JobsList = ArraytoList (BookJobs, “,”)>
4. Create a form element.
Now that you’ve got the list settled, you can go about creating the form.
Here’s some basic code that creates a form element. For the time being,
leave all the <OPTION> tags out:
<FORM action=”param.cfm” method=”post”>
<SELECT name=”job”>
</SELECT>
<INPUT type=”submit” value=”Go”>
</FORM>
5. Within the <SELECT> tags, create a <CFLOOP> that takes the list and
uses the values in option tags for the drop-down list.
Here is the resulting code first, followed by an explanation:
<CFLOOP index=”FormOptions” list=”#JobsList#”>
<CFOUTPUT><OPTION value=”#FormOptions#”
>#FormOptions#
</OPTION></CFOUTPUT>
</CFLOOP>
To make this work is a tad bit tricky. First you need to create a <CFLOOP>
and give the index a name. In this case, call it FormOptions. Then,
you call the new #JobsList# variable using a <CFOUTPUT> tag to get
the list elements. Finally, you create a single option tag and use the
#FormOptions# index value to output the values and names for
each drop-down list.
6. To preview your page, press F12.
Figure 5-8 shows the resulting output.

Working with a two-dimensional array
Two-dimensional arrays give you even more options for adding complex
datasets to your site without necessarily using a database. To show you
what we mean, we walk you through how to create a dynamically generated
text navigation by using a two-dimensional array.
First, take a look at this array:
<CFSET MyTwoDArray = ArrayNew(2)>
<CFSET MyTwoDArray[1][1] = “Home”>
<CFSET MyTwoDArray[1][2] = “index.cfm”>
<CFSET MyTwoDArray[2][1] = “Products”>
<CFSET MyTwoDArray[2][2] = “products.cfm”>
<CFSET MyTwoDArray[3][1] = “About Us”>
<CFSET MyTwoDArray[3][2] = “about.cfm”>
A couple of things jump out immediately as being different from the previ-
ous arrays in this chapter:
✦We designated this array as a two-dimensional array by adding a 2 in the
parentheses following the ArrayNew function.
✦Two sets of numbers are in brackets next to the variable when you’re
setting the values. Because this is a two-dimensional array, two number
pairs specify which row things are in (the first number), and which
column they’re in (the second number). In this case, we’ve made all the
row to column combinations equal, but they don’t need to be that way.
After you have created this two-dimensional array, you can turn it into a
navigation bar. And here’s some good news: It’s actually easy to do! Just
follow these steps:
1. Make sure that you’ve included the previous array in your document.
2. Create a <CFLOOP> tag with an index of count that starts at one and
goes to three, and be sure that the <CFLOOP> is enclosed within a
<CFOUTPUT> tag.
The code would look like this:
<CFOUTPUT>
<CFLOOP index=”count” from=”1” to=”3”></CFLOOP>
</CFOUTPUT>
3. Within the <CFLOOP> tags, create a link that references the array files
within the href and the array names within the link.
In this step, you’re adding the code that will output both the name of
the link and the corresponding linked file as the loop is being processed.
To accomplish this, use the index=”count” to pull the appropriate

Casting Data into Arrays, Lists, and Structures
692
name or page by checking the stage of the loop. Note that all the names
are in the 1 column and all the files are in the 2 column. Here’s the code
you would need to do it:
<A href=”#MyTwoDArray[count][2]#”>#MyTwoDArray[count][1]#</A><BR>
4. Press the F12 key to preview your new page.
And voilà! You should have three links, as shown in Figure 5-9.
Using structures
Structures are an interesting alternative to arrays because they can contain
any number of different kinds of data. Structures contain discreet elements,
but they are accessed through names given to the structure. Structures are
both powerful containers for data and easier to think about than arrays.
Here’s a simple example that shows how you can create a structure for
employee information:
1. Create the structure with a <CFSET> tag.
Like an array, there’s a ColdFusion function, called structnew, that you
use to cast a variable as a structure. The following code creates a new
structure for employees:
<CFSET employee= structnew()>
2. Add some data to the structure.
For this employee structure, add first name, last name, e-mail address,
department, and salary, which requires the following code:
<CFSET employee.firstname = “Bob”>
<CFSET employee.lastname = “Smith”>
<CFSET employee.email = “bobsmith@somecompany.com”>
<CFSET employee.department = “IT”>
<CFSET employee.salary= “100000”>
In a structure, the word to the right of the dot (firstname in employee.
firstname, for example) is called a key, and the combination of this
key and it’s corresponding value is called a key/value pair. New struc-
ture items are added to the employee variable, separated by a dot (the
same basic syntax that you’d see with form variables, such as #FORM.
firstname#).

array.

and Structured Data

693
3. To call the values in a structure, use a <CFOUTPUT> tag and specify the
value using its key.
To output this information to the screen, you can use the following
code:
<CFOUTPUT>
Name: #employee.firstname# #employee.lastname# <BR>
Email: #employee.email# <BR>
Department: #employee.department# <BR>
Salary: #employee.salary# <BR>
</CFOUTPUT>
4. Press F12 to preview the page.
As shown in Figure 5-10, you should see the information about an
employee, Mr. Bob Smith.
You can also cast data from a query into a structure. Imagine that a user
logged on to your corporate intranet. After the user was authenticated, the
intranet might make a query like the one we used earlier in this chapter:
<CFQUERY datasource=”CompanyInfo” name=”GetEmployeeInfo”>
SELECT * FROM employee
WHERE emp_ID=#EmployeeNumber#
</CFQUERY>
This would make all the data from the query available as variables that can
be copied into a structure.
So, as you can see, structures offer a tremendous amount of flexibility to the
developer. There are also a number of functions that can allow you to
manipulate the data in a structure. Table 5-2 includes some of these other
structure-related functions and what they do.

ook VI, Chapter 4 gives you a brief introduction to some of the basic
database concepts in ColdFusion. This chapter gives a more in-depth
look at what it means to build a database-driven Web site, both conceptually
and practically. This chapter also gives you a more detailed description of
how you can build a database and add, update, and delete data from that
database.
ColdFusion comes with some sample databases, but it isn’t a program that
you can use to build and maintain a database. To create a database, you need
a product such as Microsoft Access, Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, or Oracle.
A number of other interesting tips and tricks are covered in Book VI, Chap-
ter 4, such as how to use the WHERE clauses to filter data. Similarly, we also
show you how to use the SQL functions of INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE in
Book VI, Chapter 4.
Understanding Relational Databases
A traditional database is similar to a spreadsheet, where a collection of
worksheets make up the entire spreadsheet, usually called a workbook.
These worksheets, however, don’t have any real connection to one another,
except for the fact that they’re all part of the same workbook. A traditional
database is made up of rows and columns, as shown in Table 6-1, and func-
tions in much the same fashion as these spreadsheets. Traditional databases

all have a one-to-one relationship between the table and its data, which
means that each table has its own set of data, and that data in one table is
not connected to the data in any other table.

Relational databases have been around since 1970, when E. F. Codd invented
them at IBM. In a relational database, multiple tables are linked together
through the use of data that exists in more than one table (this is usually
referred to as cross-referencing).
In contrast to a traditional database, a relational database makes a direct
connection between items in one table and items in another table through
the use of unique identifiers, or keys. This simple concept opens up a wide
array of possibilities in database design.
Here’s a simple example. Table 6-1 shows four people that all work at the
same company, Some Company. Say that the data sits in the Contacts table.
You might have another table specifically for addresses of all the companies
you do business with, called Companies. These two tables, in the relational
style, are shown in Tables 6-2 and 6-3, respectively.

To connect the Contacts table to the Companies table, you need to cross-
reference them somehow. To do this, you can use another table. We call
that table ContactToCompany, and it includes the data shown in Table 6-4.
Table 6-4

If you look closely at Tables 6-2 and 6-3, you see that Table 6-4 shows that all
the employees in the Contacts table are now being associated with the same
address for Some Company through this intermediary table.
Designing your database using cross-reference tables provides many advan-
tages, including the following:
✦You can represent complex, many-to-many relationships, rather than
simple one-to-one relationships.
✦Updating an individual data element can impact a large number of
related records, as in the case of the address. Updating the address
automatically updates four other records in the database.
✦Your databases are more scalable. Relational databases are capable of
handling data that is more complex, and therefore can be used for a
greater variety of applications.
The net result of using relational databases is that Web developers have been
able to build increasingly complex applications based on more advanced
database designs. But the great part about relational databases is that they’re
just as applicable to smaller dynamic sites as well. It’s more about the way
you think about representing data in a database, rather than the content
itself. So as you begin to think of your first dynamic Web site, challenge
yourself to start thinking about how you want to collect data about your
products, and see if the relational database model makes sense for you.
It wouldn’t make sense to walk you through the process of building a rela-
tional database because ColdFusion is designed to use relational databases,
not to build them. However, ColdFusion supports the following products
that you can use to generate your databases:

base development. If you plan to use databases heavily for your Web site,
you should point your browser to www.dummies.com and check some of
them out! Our favorite is Microsoft SQL Server 2000 For Dummies, by
Anthony T. Mann (published by Wiley Publishing, Inc.).
Understanding ODBC and OLE
Truthfully, you don’t really need to know much about Open Database
Connectivity (ODBC) or Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) to begin
using ColdFusion. However, in the interest of clarity, we want you to know
what they are. Simply put, ODBC and OLE are different protocols that enable
the Web server to communicate with a database. Specifically, here’s what
they mean:
✦ODBC (Open Database Connectivity): ODBC is the workhorse appli-
cation programming interface (the method for interfacing between
your application and a data source) for accessing a database. We call
it a workhorse because over the past decade, this has become the
method of choice for interacting with Structured Query Language
(SQL) databases.
✦OLE (Object Linking and Embedding): OLE is the future of desktop
communication. OLE can talk to a database, much like ODBC, but OLE
is designed to provide greater integration between your desktop and a
host of interactive applications that utilize technologies like Microsoft’s
ActiveX.
In practical terms, it doesn’t make a whole lot of difference which method
you use to connect to a database. That being said, most people will agree
that OLE does provide a faster connection. However, despite the big push
by Microsoft, most people are still using ODBC as their connection method
of choice within ColdFusion, simply because of its stability and market
acceptance. Figure 6-1 shows the ColdFusion Administrator, where you can
choose your method of database connection.

Creating Queries in ColdFusion
699
Creating Queries in ColdFusion
Querying a database in ColdFusion is done through different CFML tags,
depending upon the situation. You use three basic tags to perform database
operations (there are others, too, but they’re more specialized):
✦<CFQUERY>: This is the most common query tag, and the one with which
you will no doubt become exceptionally familiar. <CFQUERY> supports
the use of SQL (Structured Query Language), and allows you to perform
a host of SQL database operations, including SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE,
and DELETE.
✦<CFINSERT>: CFML includes its only INSERT function through the
<CFINSERT> tag. You can use either <CFQUERY> or <CFINSERT> to
insert data into a database.
✦<CFUPDATE>: Similar to <CFINSERT>, this tag allows you to update
records in a database.
The details about using each of these tags are covered in the following
sections.
Figure 6-1:
Choose to
use OLE or
ODBC to

Creating Queries in ColdFusion
700
Using <CFQUERY>
<CFQUERY> is the workhorse tag in ColdFusion. You use it when you want to
perform any kind of database operation. The structure of <CFQUERY> is as
follows:
<CFQUERY name=”somename” datasource=”somedatabase”> Insert
your SQL statement here</CFQUERY>
Within this code, name is the name you assign to the query, and datasource
is a mapped database in ColdFusion and SQL. The SQL within the tags is
passed directly to the database for execution; the resulting dataset is resi-
dent in memory while the page is active, and then is made available as a
series of variables that correspond to the columns requested from the
database.
Book VI, Chapter 4 covers <CFQUERY> in more detail, including examples on
usage and how to output data from queries to the screen. Also check out
Book VI, Chapter 5 for more information on how to use the variables gener-
ated from a <CFQUERY>.
Using <CFINSERT>
<CFINSERT>, to some degree, takes the place of the INSERT SQL function. In
fact, when you use this tag, all ColdFusion is doing is taking the parameters
you specify in the tag and turning it into SQL to be executed at the database.
The basic structure of the <CFINSERT> tag is as follows:
<CFINSERT datasource=”SomeDatabase “ tablename=”SomeTable”
formfields=”FormVariable1, FormVariable2, etc. “>
<CFINSERT> is only valuable when you’re doing simple inserts to a data-
base. If the queries are more complex and require inputting into more than
one table, for example, you’ll have to use <CFQUERY> and include your SQL
there.
Here’s an example that you can try with the databases that come with
ColdFusion to show how <CFINSERT> works:
1. Create a ColdFusion page by pressing Ctrl+N in Dreamweaver, and
then save the page to your local testing area on your hard drive.
2. Create two form variables using <CFSET>.
Usually, these variables would be passed from a form to the page, but
for this demo, we’re just going to create them here in the page. Here’s
what the code for these two variables looks like:

Book VI
Chapter 6
Using
Databases with
ColdFusion MX 6.1
Developer Edition
Creating Queries in ColdFusion
701
<CFSET form.dept_name = “Web Development”>
<CFSET form.location = “San Francisco”>
3. Create a <CFINSERT> tag to put this data into the Departmt table in
the CompanyInfo database as follows:
<CFINSERT datasource=”CompanyInfo” tablename=”Departmt”
formfields=”dept_name, location”>
The CompanyInfo database comes with ColdFusion and is already
mapped as a datasource (as shown in Figure 6-2), so you don’t have to
worry about that step. This database also doesn’t need a password, so
you won’t need to include that parameter in your <CFINSERT> tag.
Now, we’re sure a couple things immediately popped into your head
when you saw this code snippet. One is that the variables are the same
name as the columns in the database. To use this tag, you need to map
the variable name to the table column. For example, if in your form, you
were capturing department as simply dept, then you could use a
<CFSET> tag to convert dept to dept_name as follows:
<CFSET dept_name = form.dept>
Figure 6-2:
Company-
Info comes

ColdFusion.

Creating Queries in ColdFusion
702
4. Create an output to see if your update worked.
You want to check to make sure your update worked, so you should
create a <CFQUERY> that checks the database to see if the record is
there. Then, of course, you need to output it to the screen with a
<CFOUTPUT> tag. Here’s the resulting code:
<CFQUERY datasource=”CompanyInfo” name=”CheckUpdate”>
SELECT Dept_ID, Dept_Name, location FROM Departmt WHERE
dept_name =’#dept_name#’
</CFQUERY>
<CFOUTPUT query=”CheckUpdate”>#Dept_ID#, #dept_name#,
#location#</CFOUTPUT>
5. Press F12 to preview your work.
Using <CFUPDATE>
<CFUPDATE> is similar in design to the <CFINSERT> tag. The difference is
that <CFUPDATE> is used to update information in an existing row, rather
than create a new row in a table. It also shares a similar structure, as
follows:
<CFUPDATE datasource=”SomeDatabase” 
tablename=”SomeTable”
formfields=”UniqueID, UpdateVariable, UpdateVariable”>
The slight difference here is that you need to select the record that you want
to update. Take the case of the change we just made to the CompanyInfo
table. The output query returned a value of 7 as the Dept_ID. So if we wanted
to update that record to reflect that Los Angeles was now where the Web
Development department was located, we’d have to do the following:
1. Set location equal to Los Angeles and Dept_ID equal to 7.
You’ll find it best if you do this in a new ColdFusion page. Here’s what
the code would look like:
<CFSET form.Dept_ID = 7>
<CFSET form.location = “Los Angeles”>
2. Create the <CFUPDATE> tag.
In this case, we specified Dept_ID so that ColdFusion knows which
record it’s looking for. We also need to specify the other field to update,
as well as the database and appropriate table. Here’s the code to update
the two columns:

<CFUPDATE datasource=”CompanyInfo”
tablename=”Departmt”
formfields=”Dept_ID,location”>
3. Press F12 to update the database.
After you’ve done this, you can also then run the output query from the pre-
vious example to see the change.
<CFUPDATE> is really only good for the most basic of updates to a database.
If you need to update more than one record at a time, you’re better off using
<CFQUERY>.

hen you’ve got the basics of your site running smoothly, you can
start taking a closer look at some of the more advanced features in
ColdFusion. In this chapter, we show you how you can extend the function-
ality of forms on your site, as well as how to keep information available
throughout the duration of a user’s visit. We also walk you through how to
send e-mail and make charts, and finally, provide you with all the informa-
tion you need to create your own CFML tags.
Using <CFFORM>
You may be familiar with HTML forms from Dreamweaver MX 2004. But
did you know that you can use ColdFusion to check form fields for values?
You can do precisely that using <CFFORM> and <CFINPUT> tags. Although
<CFFORM> and <CFINPUT> initially look similar to plain old HTML forms, you
can set a number of different parameters with ColdFusion forms. These
parameters, when read by a ColdFusion server, are converted to JavaScript
to provide the desired functionality.
Take a look at this brief code snippet:
<CFFORM action=”form.cfm” method=”post” name=”MyForm”>
<CFINPUT type=”text” name=”FirstName” required=”yes”
message=”This is a required field”>
<INPUT type=”submit” value=”Go”>
</CFFORM>

Using <CFFORM>
706
This is a simple form that looks almost like any other form you’d see
in an HTML page, except for the addition of required =”yes” and 
message=”This is a required field”. If you saved this code in a page
entitled form.cfm, loaded the page on a ColdFusion-enabled server, and
clicked the Go button without including a value for the field, you’d get an
error message, just like the one you see in Figure 7-1.
If you think the dialog box in Figure 7-1 looks a lot like something you’d see
coming from JavaScript, well, you’re correct: It is JavaScript! If you view the
source of the resulting page, you can see what happened. First, the following
code was added to the head of the document:
<SCRIPT LANGUAGE=”JavaScript” TYPE=”text/javascript”>
<!--
function  _CF_checkMyForm(_CF_this)
{
if  (!_CF_hasValue(_CF_this.FirstName, “TEXT” ))
{
if  (!_CF_onError(_CF_this,
_CF_this.FirstName, _CF_this.FirstName.value, “This is a
required field”))
{
return false;
}
}
return true;
}
//-->
</SCRIPT>
All this JavaScript does is check to see if the text field has a value in it. If it
does, great, nothing happens. If it doesn’t, then the JavaScript code creates
a pop-up warning saying, “This is a required field.”
The form itself was also changed, as follows:

<INPUT type=”submit” value=”Go”>
</FORM>
When <CFFORM> was read by the ColdFusion server, it collected all
the requirements of all the <CFINPUT> tags and then generated all the
JavaScript needed for the form validation. Then, it converted the <CFFORM>
and <CFINPUT> tags to regular HTML form elements. Finally, it added
onSubmit=”return _CF_checkMyForm(this)”, which calls the JavaScript
that is doing the validation.
This feature provides you with an easy and fast way to validate your forms
on the browser, before any data is ever submitted, and there are several
parameters that you can set. All of these parameters are set in the <CFINPUT>
tag, and the most common ones for <CFFORM>, <CFINPUT>, and <CFSELECT>
are listed in Table 7-1.
Because this type of form validation uses JavaScript that is read by a user’s
browser, if a user chooses to turn off JavaScript in his or her browser, this
type of validation won’t work.
Form validation done in the manner discussed here is called client-side vali-
dation. You can also validate forms after the data has been sent to the server,
called server-side validation. To learn more about server-side validation,
check out ColdFusion MX For Dummies, by John Paul Ashenfelter and Jon
Kocen (published by Wiley Publishing, Inc.).
In addition to <CFINPUT>, <CFSELECT> can also be used to create drop-
down lists. Check out <CFSELECT> in the CFML Reference in the ColdFusion
documentation for a good example of how to use <CFSELECT> with a data-
base query to populate a drop-down list.

Working with Sessions and Cookies
Before getting into the “how” of sessions and cookies, it would be good to
review what both sessions and cookies are and why they can be exception-
ally useful in Web development. ColdFusion uses two different types of
variables:
✦Persistent: Session variables and cookies are examples of persistent
variables. These variables are present throughout the user’s time on
the site and perhaps longer. Session variables are kept in memory, and
cookies can be kept in a text file or in memory on the user’s computer.
✦Non-persistent: These variables are present only in a single ColdFusion
page. By default, all variables are non-persistent variables. Unless they
are actively passed from page to page — through a URL string like page.
cfm?itemID=10000, for example — these variables will be resident only
for that single page.
Persistent variables are great because after they’ve been set, they’re always
available, and you don’t have to worry about passing them from page to
page. For things like user IDs, user preferences, contact information, e-mail
addresses, and other custom information about a user, persistent variables
are a perfect way to store that information. The following sections walk you
through how to generate cookies and use session variables, and point out
the advantages to each method.

Using session variables
Session variables, variables which are resident throughout a users time on a
site, are best used when you have information that you only want to keep
available while the user’s browser is open and while the user is on your site.
For example, you may want to use a session variable for things like a user ID
or user preferences. These are global items, in the sense that they’re needed
throughout the user’s time on the site, as opposed to just one section or
function of the site.
Follow these steps to create a session variable:
1. In the ColdFusion Administrator, make sure that session variables are
enabled.
By default, they should be enabled, but it’s always a good idea to check.
In the ColdFusion Administrator, which is shown in Figure 7-2, you can
find session variables by selecting Memory Variables from the left navi-
gation bar under Server Settings.

session
variables

Admin-
istrator.

Working with Sessions and Cookies
710
2. In your Application.cfm file, turn on session management.
You turn on session management by adding a <CFAPPLICATION> tag to
your application.cfm file. You enable it by setting sessionmanage-
ment=”yes”. You can also specify the timeout (how long the cookie is
valid for) here by using the sessiontimeout parameter. The code is as
follows:
<CFAPPLICATION NAME=”Name of Application”
SESSIONMANAGEMENT=”Yes”
SESSIONTIMEOUT=”#CreateTimeSpan(days, hours, minutes,
seconds)#”>
The values that you choose for days, hours, minutes, and seconds are
all integers.
3. Create your session variable.
Creating a session variable has two components:
• Set the variable: Setting the variable looks like setting any other
type of variable, except that the variable name must be preceded by
the session scope (this is the same scope that we discuss in Book VI,
Chapter 3) followed by a period, as follows:
<CFSET session.MySessionVariable = SomeValue>
• Lock the code: In addition to setting the variable, you also need to
lock the code. Locking the code simply means that you’re going to
make sure that the server keeps your request separate from any
others that may be occurring at the same time. To do this, you use
a <CFLOCK> tag that encompasses the <CFSET> tag, as follows:
<CFLOCK scope=”SESSION” timeout=”20” type=”EXCLUSIVE”>
<CFSET session.MySessionVariable = SomeValue>
</CFLOCK>
In this code, scope is where you want the lock to occur, timeout
is how long you want the session to remain locked, and type is the
kind of lock you want to perform. Exclusive locks allow one server
request at a time to read or write shared data, where as read-only
locks allow more than one request to read shared data. For more
information on where you should use exclusive or read-only locks,
check out the ColdFusion documentation by pressing Ctrl+F1 in
Dreamweaver.
4. Include the session scope so that you can call the variable in your
code when it’s set.
All session variables need to include the “session.” precursor when
calling the variable in a <CFOUTPUT> tag, as follows:
<CFOUTPUT>#session.MySessionVariable#</CFOUTPUT>

Working with Sessions and Cookies
711
Setting and retrieving cookies
Cookies are a great way to keep information about a user around for an
extended period of time so that you can use it when they visit your site a
multitude of times. Unlike a session, which expires after a given period of
time, a cookie actually is a text file that resides on a user’s computer. This
text file usually contains some kind of persistent information about the user,
such as an e-mail address, site preferences, or perhaps a log of when he or
she last was on the site. As a developer, the value in being able to retrieve
this information is to deliver a more targeted, user-friendly application.
Not everyone likes cookies. Some people view them as intrusive or even
dangerous because they’re allowing an outside site the ability to write a
file to their computer. Some people even block cookies. Good net etiquette
requires that you must always be judicious when using cookies, and be sure
to explicitly state in your site’s privacy policy just what you’re using those
cookies to accomplish.
Here’s how you can use ColdFusion to add a cookie:
1. Enable cookies in your application.
Much like sessions, before you can create a cookie, you first have to
set up your application to support cookies. This can be done in the
application.cfm file, using the same <CFAPPLICATION> tag that you
would use to set up sessions. You need the following three tag values
to be set:
• CLIENTMANAGEMENT=”Yes”
• CLIENTSTORAGE=”Cookie”
• SETCLIENTCOOKIES=”Yes”
After these are set, you can get about the business of generating cookies.
2. On the page you want to set a cookie, create a <CFCOOKIE> tag and
give it a name.
ColdFusion includes a tag specifically for the writing of cookies. While
you can use dots (.) in cookie names, be sure to avoid spaces and vague
names. Here’s an example of a well-named and well-formed cookie:
<CFCOOKIE name=”EmailAddress”>
3. Assign the cookie a value.
A cookie value can be just about any kind of string, constant, or variable.
It cannot, however, include complex values like arrays or structures.
For example, if your site has a newsletter that requires a user’s e-mail

Working with Sessions and Cookies
712
address, you could include a check box at sign-up that says “Remember
my e-mail address.” If you set the cookie value to #email#, then you
could retrieve that value when the user returns to the site. The syntax
for setting this value would be as follows:
<CFCOOKIE name=”EmailAddress” value=”#email#”>
4. Set an expiration date for the cookie.
Setting the expiration date lets the computer know when to remove the
cookie from the user’s machine. You can give the expires parameter
several possible types of values:
• A specific date (in mm/dd/yy format)
• A specific number of days into the future (1, 2, 30, and so on)
• now, which deletes the cookie
• never, which writes the cookie and never removes it
If you don’t want this cookie to expire, the syntax for the cookie would
now look as follows:
<CFCOOKIE name=”EmailAddress” value=”#email#”
expires=”never”>
5. Add additional parameters to the cookie tag.
You can choose to specify three other pieces of information through
this tag (check out the CFML reference in Dreamweaver for more
detailed information on these parameters):
• Domain: This parameter sets the Internet Domain for which the
cookie’s content is valid. The domain name must start with a period
(.), and is a required tag if you use the path parameter. The syntax is
as follows: domain =”.mydomain.com”
• Path: This parameter limits the validity of a cookie to a specific path
within a domain. If you use this parameter, then the domain parame-
ter is also required. The syntax is as follows: path=”/newsletters”
• Secure: This is a simple yes or no flag for the parameter. If yes is
selected, then the cookie will only be set if the site is using Secure
Socket Layers (SSL). The syntax is as follows: secure=”no”
When the page is processed, the cookie will be set. To check to see if your
cookie worked locally while you’re testing, check out the local cookies direc-
tory on your computer, as shown in Figure 7-3.

Sending Mail
713
Sending Mail
If you want to have users sign up for something on your site — a mailing
list for example — then you’re probably going to want to take advantage of
ColdFusion’s mail tools. Before we describe how to do it, though, be warned:
You’re going to need to have access to an e-mail server (SMTP) to take advan-
tage of this tag, so be sure to check with your Internet service provider and
make sure that you have this kind of service.
After you’ve got that squared away, sending mail is a breeze. Check out the
code snippet in the following example. In it, we create a very simple little
form that includes first name, last name, and e-mail address, and then with
the Steps list, we walk you through sending an e-mail. All of this code goes
in the same file, called mail.cfm.
Here’s the initial FORM code:
<FORM method=”post” action=”mail.cfm”>
First Name:&nbsp;&nbsp;<INPUT name=”first” type=”text” maxlength=”60”><BR>
Last Name:&nbsp; <INPUT name=”last” type=”text” maxlength=”60”><BR>
Email:&nbsp; <INPUT name=”email” type=”text” maxlength=”60”><BR>
<INPUT type=”submit” value=”Send Mail”>
</FORM>
To make things simple, we post the request to the same page as the form,
as indicated by the method=”post” and action=”mail.cfm” parameters.
Certainly you could have your send-mail page separate. To create the mail,
follow these steps:
Figure 7-3:
The local
cookies
directory.

Sending Mail
714
1. Use <CFPARAM> to check for the existence of the three variables in the
form and give them default values.
Because the form and the logic required to send the mail are on the
same ColdFusion page, you first need to make sure that the variables
exist. If they don’t, ColdFusion returns an error for the code in the next
step. This code, placed above the <FORM> tag, checks for the existence
of the three variables in the form, and if they don’t exist, creates them
and gives them an empty value. Here’s the code:
<CFPARAM name=”email” default=””>
<CFPARAM name=”first” default=””>
<CFPARAM name=”last” default=””>
2. Create a conditional statement that checks for the existence of the
variable email.
You really only need the e-mail address to make this work, so we want
to make sure that it has a value associated with it. To do this, you can
use a simple <CFIF> tag to test for the length of the variable email, as
shown here:
<CFIF len(first) is NOT 0>
Place this <CFIF> after the FORM element in your page. If the length of
the variable email is not 0, then you know it must have a value and
then you can send a message.
Even though you’ve tested for the existence of the variable, you haven’t
tested to see whether or not that e-mail address is “well-formed,” mean-
ing it has an at symbol (@) and a dot (.). As it’s currently structured, if
we put the word “boo” in the e-mail field, it would try to send mail to
“boo,” which, of course, is not a valid e-mail address.
3. Create a <CFMAIL> tag within the <CFIF> tag.
With <CFMAIL>, you can specify a number of options. (You can press
Ctrl+F1 to access the ColdFusion reference within Dreamweaver to find
out more about all the options.) For this message, you only need to be
concerned about the following set of parameters:
• to: The address the message is being sent to
• from: The address you want the message to be shown as coming from
• subject: The subject of the message
• server: The mail server that’s going to send the message
For the <CFMAIL> parameters, you can use static values and variables,
as well as putting the body of the message in between the opening and
closing tags.

For an example message, we use #email# to specify the destination
address, and then we use #first# and #last# to personalize the mes-
sage by addressing it to the recipient. Finally, we include a small note to
let the user know the message was sent. Again, this will be part of the
<CFIF> tag, following the FORM element. The resulting code looks like
this:
<CFMAIL to=”#email#” from=”damon@loungeboy.com”
subject=”Here’s Your Message, #first#”
server=”mail.loungeboy.com”>Dear #first# #last#,
Isn’t this mailer the coolest thing!
</CFMAIL>
<P style=”color: green”>Thank you. Your message has
been sent to <CFOUTPUT>#email#</CFOUTPUT></P>
4. Move the message to your testing server and try it out by sending
yourself an e-mail.
Figure 7-4 shows the e-mail you get in your Inbox.

Imagine for a moment that you’re a world-renowned scientist who’s been
tracking doggie treat consumption for the year 2003. Table 7-2 includes

This data is collected from hundreds of different interviews with dog owners
and has been saved as a table called Summary in a Microsoft Access data-
base. Now, you want to make this information available on the Internet as
part of your ongoing search for funding sources. With ColdFusion, you can
easily generate charts of this information dynamically:
1. Create a new page to display the charts and save it to the local
machine where your testing server is located.
2. Create a query to get the data you want to display graphically.
The following query can be used to get the doggie treat data:
<CFQUERY name=”TreatSummary” datasource=”DoggieTreats”>
SELECT Month, Treats, SummaryID FROM Summary
ORDER BY SummaryID
</CFQUERY>
Before you can make this query, you need to have a data source set up in
ColdFusion Administrator. For details on how to do this, refer to Book VI,
Chapter 2.
3. Set up the parameters of the chart using <CFCHART>.
Much like <CFMAIL>, you can set a number of different options to cus-
tomize the labels, size, color, and overall appearance of your graphs.
The following code snippet only uses a handful of them. Refer to the
CFML Reference Guide (press Ctrl+F1 in Dreamweaver) for a complete
listing of the parameters you can set. Here’s one way to configure your
chart:
<CFCHART chartheight=”500” chartwidth=”500”
format=”jpg” font=”Arial” fontsize=”10”
labelformat=”number” show3d=”yes”>

In this snippet, we set the chart to be 500 pixels wide by 500 pixels high,
set the graph file format to be a JPEG, set the font to Arial, and set the
font size to 10 pixels. Lastly, we set the label format to a number, and we
make the graph 3D.
4. Specify the type of chart you want using <CFCHARTSERIES>.
The <CFCHARTSERIES> tag allows you to define the kind of chart you
want to display. Again, you can specify a number of different parameters.
If you’re only interested in making this a simple bar chart, your code
would look as follows:
<CFCHARTSERIES type=”bar”>
5. Create a <CFLOOP> to create all the <CFCHARTDATA> entries that repre-
sent the data for the graph.
The <CFCHARTDATA> tag is used to specify the item/value pairs for the
data in the graph. (In this example, January is an item and 54 is a value.)
To create these tags, use a <CFLOOP> to get all the month and treat pairs
into individual <CFCHARTDATA> tags. Here’s how it looks:
<CFLOOP query=”TreatSummary” startrow=”1” endrow=”12”>
<CFCHARTDATA item=”#Month#” value=”#Treats#”></CFLOOP>
6. Make sure that all your code is closed out by including close tags for
all the chart functions.
The <CFCHART>, <CFCHARTSERIES>, and <CFCHARTDATA> tags require
closing tags. So all the chart code together should look as follows:
<CFCHART chartheight=”500” chartwidth=”500”
format=”jpg” font=”Arial” fontsize=”10”
labelformat=”number” show3d=”yes”>
<CFCHARTSERIES type=”bar”>
<CFLOOP query=”TreatSummary” startrow=”1” endrow=”12”>
<CFCHARTDATA item=”#Month#” value=”#Treats#”></CFLOOP>
</CFCHARTSERIES>
</CFCHART>
7. Press F12 to see the new graph.
Figure 7-5 shows the rather unglamorous but nonetheless effective
graph that is generated.
Although these specific charting tags are a great feature for ColdFusion, cre-
ating dynamic graphs is definitely slow and a processor hog. You should
consider carefully whether or not you can live with slow-loading pages to
have dynamic graphs.

Building Custom Tags
718
Building Custom Tags
As diverse as ColdFusion is, you may find at times that the base set of func-
tions and tags can’t do exactly what you’d like it to do. In those instances, you
might consider taking advantage of ColdFusion’s custom tags. In ColdFusion,
you can create your own CFML tags that are read by the server just like any
other ColdFusion tag. ColdFusion custom tags can be made up of CFML
code or a scripting language, such as JavaScript or ColdFusion Script.
Here’s a good example of a handy custom tag to have around your
online store that also shows how custom tags work. This tag, called 
<CF_makediscount>, takes a price and a discount and returns to the
page the discounted price.
Here’s how you would create the tag if you were doing it from scratch:
1. Create a structure for the custom tag.
Before you begin anything, you have to decide how you want the infor-
mation to be passed to the custom tag. Your tag should follow the fol-
lowing conventions:
Figure 7-5:
It’s not
glamorous,
but it works.

Book VI
Chapter 7
Advanced
Features in
ColdFusion MX 6.1
Developer Edition
Building Custom Tags
719
• The tag is enclosed by brackets ( < and > ).
• The tag begins with a CF_ so that ColdFusion recognizes it as a
custom tag and looks for it in the custom tag directory (usually
C:\cfusionMX\customtags on the server).
• The rest of the name of the tag corresponds to the filename
that includes the code for the custom tag. So if your tag is 
<CF_somename>, then there should be a file called somename.
cfm in the ColdFusion custom tag directory.
• Any parameters within the tag are passed as variables to the file that
contains the tag’s code. Accordingly, <CF_somename name=”foo”>
will pass the value foo to the file somename.cfm.
In the <CF_makediscount> example, the tag follows this structure:
<CF_makediscount price=’someprice’
discount=’somediscount’>
somediscount, by the way, is a decimal value, not a dollar amount.
2. Create a new ColdFusion file called makediscount.cfm.
This file contains the code that evaluates the price and the discount,
and then returns the resulting discounted price back to the page that’s
asking for it.
3. Within the makediscount.cfm file, create the code needed to return
the discounted price.
Here’s the code required to perform the entire operation:
<CFIF len(attributes.price) gt 1>
<CFSET caller.newprice = DollarFormat
(Evaluate(price - (price * discount))) >
<CFELSE>
<CFSET caller.newprice = ‘’>
</CFIF>
Here’s what’s going on this code:
• First, it checks to make sure that, in fact, the tag has passed a value
by saying that if the length of the variable is greater than 1 — in which
case something must be there — then the code assumes it’s a valid
value. If no value exists, then the code sets the variable caller.
newprice equal to a null value (a null value is an empty value) and
passes that empty value back to the page that made the request to
the tag.
• When these variables have been passed to the page, the simple
equation of discount price = price – (price * discount) is
performed.

Building Custom Tags
720
• Performing this equation is also part of setting a new variable,
caller.newprice, which is sent back to the page that made the
call to the custom tag originally.
You may not be familiar with two scopes in the preceding code. The
attribute scope is used in custom tags to denote the value being passed
to the custom tag by the calling page. The caller scope sends the value
from the custom tag back to the original calling page.
4. Test the tag by giving it values and outputting the return value to the
screen using <CFOUTPUT>.
Figure 7-6 shows how this tag works on a Web page. In the page, you see
places for price, discount, and the resulting discounted price.
After you’ve tried this and it’s successful, you’ve built your very first custom
tag, and you’re well on your way to building new tags for all those complex
functions on your site!

oldFusion can add a tremendous amount of dynamic power to your
Web applications. As a member of Macromedia Studio MX 2004,
ColdFusion has also become more integrated with other Macromedia prod-
ucts. In this chapter, we provide a brief overview of how Macromedia has
chosen to integrate ColdFusion 6.1 Developer Edition with Dreamweaver MX
2004, Fireworks MX 2004, and Macromedia Flash MX 2004. ColdFusion and
FreeHand MX don’t overlap or integrate, feature-wise.
Integrating ColdFusion with Dreamweaver
Nowhere is the integration effort more apparent than within Dreamweaver.
ColdFusion Studio, previously its own stand-alone application, has been
fully integrated into Dreamweaver. This melding of the products provides
developers with the best of both worlds: The easy to use, graphical orienta-
tion of Dreamweaver has been combined with the dynamic development
platform of ColdFusion. You can now find ColdFusion tools throughout
Dreamweaver:
✦The Insert bar: The Insert bar has three categories that include a wide
array of ColdFusion tags, functions, and wizard-like tools. These tools
are covered in more detail in Book II, Chapter 6.
✦The Application panel: The Application panel allows you to view data
in databases, generate queries, and even build ColdFusion components
(bits of code that are encapsulated and made available to all the parts
of your application). The Applications panel is discussed in depth in
Book II, Chapter 6.

Integrating ColdFusion with Dreamweaver
722
✦The Code view: The Code view, which is shown in Figure 8-1, is the
development interface that users had grown accustomed to using in
previous versions of HomeSite and ColdFusion Studio. Now, this same
interface is available directly in Dreamweaver.
✦The Code panel: The Code panel includes documentation and tools that
were previously available in ColdFusion Studio and have simply been
ported to this new interface.
With all these areas of Dreamweaver that include ColdFusion components,
you also have access to many ColdFusion features. The following
ColdFusion features are now fully integrated into Dreamweaver:
✦Insert variables, functions, and queries: You can insert variables,
functions, and queries through wizards and dialog boxes. You can find
the tools to insert these objects on the Insert bar. For example, if you
select the CFML category and click the database icon, you can fill in the
blanks and create a <CFQUERY> tag to retrieve content from a database.
✦Work with databases: You can select databases and collect record sets
from them. To do this, select the Databases tab in the Application panel.
If you don’t have a site set up, you’ll need to configure your Data Sources.
Don’t worry, Dreamweaver provides a checklist for you to follow to do
this! You also find more information on how to retrieve data from a data-
base in Book II, Chapter 6.

✦Generate dynamic content: You can generate dynamic content by
accessing different sources through the Bindings tab on the Application
panel. You can also set up variables, give them names, and then just
drag them right onto your workspace. For more information on how to
use variables in ColdFusion, check out Book VI, Chapter 5.
✦Specify server-side actions: You can specify a variety of server-side
actions through the Server Behavior tab in the Application panel.
✦Set connections to remote servers: You can set connections to remote
servers using ColdFusion’s RDS (Remote Development Services). To use
this feature, create a site and specify the RDS connection in the Remote
Info category of the Site Definition dialog box, as shown in Figure 8-2. To
bring up the Site Definition dialog box, choose Site➪Edit Sites, and then
from the Edit Sites dialog box, select your Web site’s name and click the
Edit button.
✦Create and add ColdFusion components to your application: Using
components is beyond the scope of this book. However, ColdFusion MX
For Dummies, by John Paul Ashenfelter and Jon Kocen (published by
Wiley Publishing, Inc.), includes hands-on tutorials of how to use com-
ponents in ColdFusion.

✦Link directly to the ColdFusion Administrator: You can link directly
from Dreamweaver to the ColdFusion Administrator by selecting Modify
Data Sources in the Database tab of the Application panel.
✦Change the Dreamweaver interface: You can change the product inter-
face to look just like ColdFusion Studio or HomeSite. This procedure is
covered in detail in Book II, Chapter 1.

and ColdFusion, check out Book II, Chapter 6.
Integrating ColdFusion with Fireworks
The integration between Fireworks and Dreamweaver is both extensive and
well-thought-out. ColdFusion, however, doesn’t play much of a role at all in
that integration. In fact, the only place in Fireworks where ColdFusion is
mentioned at all is in the Export feature. In Fireworks, if you choose File➪
Export➪Options, you can set the export extension to a .cfm file for
ColdFusion.
Be sure to check out the Macromedia Exchange at www.macromedia.com/
exchange. Macromedia is always adding new extensions for products, and
it’s here that you are likely to find any Fireworks-to-ColdFusion tools.
Integrating ColdFusion with Macromedia Flash
One of the best pieces of product integration in Macromedia Studio is
between ColdFusion and Macromedia Flash. In the recent versions of
Macromedia Flash and ColdFusion, Macromedia provided developers with a
new way to get dynamic data from ColdFusion into the Macromedia Flash
interface. This method, which involved creating XML in ColdFusion with the
dynamic data and then calling the file through ActionScript, was a good first
step, but it was a convoluted way to query a database, and it slowed down
your Flash movies.
With the introduction of ColdFusion MX, Macromedia significantly expanded
its integration efforts in an effort to define Macromedia Flash as an interac-
tive, Web-compatible display layer that can easily and efficiently communi-
cate with the business logic through ColdFusion. In other words, Macromedia
is betting the proverbial farm that developers really want to create dynamic
sites using Macromedia Flash for the display side and ColdFusion for the
database side.

The information that follows is specific to Macromedia Flash MX Professional
2004. Macromedia Flash MX 2004 (no Professional) is currently bundled
with Macromedia Studio. So, while these features do exist, you’ll need to
upgrade to the Professional version of Macromedia Flash to take advantage
of them.
The result of all this development work can be boiled down to two 
features:
✦The Macromedia Flash Remoting service: This service allows you to
connect directly to an application server, such as ColdFusion, and exe-
cute server-side ActionScript.
✦New query support for ActionScript: Now, with server-side ActionScript,
you can access data in ColdFusion directly using two new functions,
called CF.query and CF.http, that are functionally akin to the
<CFQUERY> and <CFHTTP> CFML tags.
In addition to the Macromedia Flash Remoting service, Macromedia also
provides another communication server product, the Macromedia Flash
Communication Server. With this product, Macromedia Flash talks to a com-
munication server using ActionScript, and the server in turn can communi-
cate with a ColdFusion server. For more information on these tools, check
out the Macromedia Flash MX ActionScript Bible, by Robert Reinhardt and
Joey Lott (published by Wiley Publishing, Inc.).
Advanced Macromedia Flash and ColdFusion integration just isn’t easy,
and it really goes beyond the scope of this book. If you’re looking for a
good hands-on guide to these new features, check out ColdFusion MX
For Dummies, by John Paul Ashenfelter and Jon Kocen (also published
by Wiley Publishing, Inc.).
Macromedia provides developers with the Designer & Developer Center,
a fine resource for discovering more about Macromedia products and
how to use them. You can find the Designer & Developer Center at  www.
macromedia.com/desdev.
Using the Macromedia Flash Remoting service
The Macromedia Flash Remoting service enables you to use Macromedia
Flash to connect directly to an application server, such as ColdFusion, and
it also offers developers greater access to dynamic content and more
advanced scripting tools. The basic way in which this interaction takes
place between the Flash client and the server is shown in Figure 8-3.

Integrating ColdFusion with Macromedia Flash
726
The following steps outline the process of making the connection to the
Macromedia Flash Remoting service, both on the ColdFusion and on the
Macromedia Flash sides:
1. Make sure that the remoting service is installed and that you have a
copy of Macromedia Flash MX Professional 2004 installed.
You can find the installer for the remoting service in the folder
D:\Flash MX\Extending Flash MX, assuming that D:\ is your
CD-ROM drive with the Macromedia Studio installation disc in it.
2. To be able to use the service, you need to include the files
NetSevices.as and NetDebug.as in your Macromedia Flash
ActionScript.
These two files tell Macromedia Flash how to manage the remote con-
nection after it’s been made and to provide the debugging output for
the service. NetDebug is optional, and really should only be used when
you’re testing your application. Your ActionScript should look as follows:
#include “NetServices.as”
#include “NetDebug.as”
3. Specify the location for the remote service.
Basically, this just means that you need to tell Macromedia Flash
where to look to find the ColdFusion application server on the machine
where your server-side ActionScript resides. Usually, your ColdFusion
server (and therefore, the Remoting Gateway) is located at http://
localhost, or http://localhost:8500. The code in your Macromedia
Flash ActionScript should look like the following:
NetServices.setDefaultGatewayURL(“http://localhost/
flashservices/gateway “)
The /flashservices/gateway part is a built-in virtual directory that
uses ActionScript to connect to the remoting service.

4. Set the connection.
When you’re ready, in your ActionScript you need to say, “Open, gate-
way,” which can be done with the following ActionScript:
gatewayConnection =
NetServices.createGatewayConnection()
5. Go get your content!
This is where the approaches to getting content diverge. At this point,
you can choose to either call a ColdFusion component or a server-side
ActionScript file. For every service you call, though, you need the fol-
lowing bit of ActionScript:
Service = gatewayConnnection.getService(“Filename”,
this);
Where service is the name of the instance you are invoking,
gatewayConnection.getService is the function that gets the server-
side ActionScript file, filename is the name of the ActionScript file
without the extension, and this represents the current instance of
the service.
The Macromedia Web site has a great paper written by Stephen Gilson that
walks you through a lot of this in more detail. The paper is entitled “Using
Macromedia Flash Remoting with Macromedia ColdFusion,” and you can
find it by going to the Designer & Developer Center and selecting Flash
Remoting from the Development Centers drop-down list. You can also find
this paper in the ColdFusion support documentation area of the
Macromedia Web site.
Working with CF.query and CF.http
As part of the new server-side ActionScript element of the Macromedia
Flash Remoting service, Macromedia has developed two new functions that
you can use to interact with the ColdFusion server without having to learn
CFML:
✦CF.query: CF.query is a server-side ActionScript function that allows
you to execute ColdFusion queries from within a Flash movie. This func-
tionality allows developers to execute database-driven applications
directly from Macromedia Flash through server-side ActionScripts. The
following syntax shows the arguments that CF.query supports in this
version:
CF.query
({
datasource:”data source name”,
sql:”SQL stmts”,
username:”username”,
password:”password”,

Integrating ColdFusion with Macromedia Flash
728
maxrows:number,
timeout:milliseconds
})
There are actually two different ways you can express the CF.query
and CF.http functions. Both are acceptable, and here’s what the other
method looks like:
CF.query(datasource, sql);
CF.query(datasource, sql, maxrows);
CF.query(datasource, sql, username, password);
CF.query(datasource, sql, username, password, maxrows);
✦CF.http: CF.http is an ActionScript function that allows HTTP POST
and GET methods to be executed from within a Flash movie. CF.http
provides a gateway through which information can be passed back and
forth to the ColdFusion server. The following syntax shows the argu-
ments that CF.http supports in this version:
CF.http
({
method:”get or post”,
url:”URL”,
username:”username”,
password:”password”,
resolveurl:”yes or no”,
params:arrayvar,
path:”path”,
file:”filename”
})
Within Dreamweaver, check out the ColdFusion Help (Using ColdFusion
in Dreamweaver) for a complete description of how to set up Macromedia
Flash Remoting and invoking CF.query and CF.http. You can access Using
ColdFusion in Dreamweaver by pressing Ctrl+F1.
Understanding the Macromedia
Flash Communication Server
The Macromedia Flash Communication Server provides a similar functional-
ity as Macromedia Flash Remoting; the primary difference between the two
is in the design. In the Macromedia Flash Communication Server design,
rather than talking directly to an application server, the Macromedia Flash
client talks to the Macromedia Flash Communication Server, which in turn
talks to the ColdFusion server. You can find out more about the Macromedia
Flash Communication Server in Book V, Chapter 10.
If you’re interested in finding out more about how and when to use
the Macromedia Flash Communication Server, you should check out

Book VI

“Macromedia Flash Communication Server: Use Cases and Feature Over-
view for RichMedia, Messaging, and Collaboration,” a white paper written
by Jonathan Gay and Sarah Allen, the engineers who built the product. You
can find this paper in the ColdFusion support documentation area of the
Macromedia Web site at www.macromedia.com/desdev/mx/flashcom.
Charting
The other integration point between ColdFusion and Macromedia Flash is in
ColdFusion’s charting tools. The default file type for charts generated using
the <CFCHART> tag is .fla. You can also choose to have the files generated
as JPEG and PNG files. At present, if you select Macromedia Flash as the
format, ColdFusion does not animate or otherwise take advantage of Flash
animation in the generated chart.

F
or many big Internet and intranet sites these days, Web development
experts are the ones who author the site (that is, they design it and
build it from scratch, or at least set up its basic framework). After a site is
established, it may then need to grow and change — which in the past meant
calling in that handy Web development expert again to update a Web site.
Now, however, people more familiar with the content that needs to go on the
site than with the vagaries of Web development are being asked to take on
the responsibility of updating the original pages or adding new pages based
on existing designs.
The original version of Dreamweaver was built to enable people to create
and modify Web pages without having to learn the boring ins and outs of
HTML. The funny thing is, the “new-and-improved” Dreamweaver MX 2004
has become so powerful as an authoring tool that it’s too complex and
intimidating (and expensive!) for non-experts who simply want to maintain
an existing site.
So what’s a non-expert to do? Read on to discover the answer.
Why Contribute?
When Dreamweaver is too much, Contribute is just right. Contribute is
designed especially for people who must contribute to an existing site but
don’t need or want to know how to develop a site from scratch.
Contribute is streamlined to make Web page production as simple as possible,
which means there are many things the application can’t do, such as editing
the HTML making up the page. For those kinds of tasks, you definitely still
need Dreamweaver. Table 1-1 offers a list of some common Web page tasks
that each application can be used for.

As you can see, there’s quite a bit of overlap in the capabilities of the two
applications, but the more complicated tasks are best accomplished using
Dreamweaver.
Exploring the Contribute Interface
The Contribute interface is as streamlined as its functionality, as you can
see in Figure 1-1. Two panels are at the left, with a big work area — known as
the Browser — at the right.
Panel basics
While other applications in the Macromedia Studio MX 2004 suite have
many customizable panels, Contribute has just two basic panels, the Pages
panel and the How Do I panel, as shown in Figure 1-1. Unlike the panels in
other Macromedia Studio applications, you can’t move, group, or delete the
panels in Contribute.

Book VII
Chapter 1

735
You can, however, collapse and expand the panels by clicking the arrow
at the top left of the panel or by clicking the panel name. If the panel was
expanded before you clicked, it collapses. If it was collapsed originally, it
expands.
You can hide (or show) both panels by using the keyboard shortcut F4.
The Pages panel
The Pages panel displays the name of the most recent page you browsed to,
any unpublished drafts you have (that is, any pages you have downloaded
and edited but not uploaded back to the server), and the page on which
you’re currently working. Figure 1-2 shows that we’re currently working on
the page titled “AAT : Treets,” and that we have a draft of the “AAT : Artists”
page that has been edited but not yet uploaded.
To navigate to any page listed in the Pages panel, click the title or the icon
to the left of the title of the page you want to display in the Browser.
If you click on the page at the top of the list, the Browser automatically
switches to Browse mode. If you’re already in Browse mode and you click a
Draft, the Browser automatically switches to Edit mode and displays your
page, ready to edit.
Figure 1-1:

and the

Exploring the Contribute Interface
736
The Browser is always at the top of the list in the Pages panel. See “The
Browser/Editor” section, later in this chapter, for more information on the
Browser itself.
The How Do I panel
The How Do I panel has three sections when you open Contribute for the
first time (refer to Figure 1-1 to see the panel in its basic state):
✦Get Started
✦Add a New Page to My Website
✦Administer a Website
By default, all sections are expanded. It’s easy to collapse or expand a sec-
tion; just click the arrow at the left of the section name, or click on the sec-
tion name itself. If the section is expanded when you clicked, it collapses.
If the section is collapsed when you click, it expands.
Each section has a list of actions you might want to perform. The list is in
the form of text links, just like on a Web page. The list of links changes, based
on what you’re currently working on. We collapsed the first two sections in
Figure 1-2 so that you can see some of the other sections that show up auto-
matically in the How Do I panel when you’re editing a page.

When you click a link, the How Do I panel updates, as shown in Figure 1-3.
To return to the previous page of information in the panel, click on the Back
button at the top left of the How Do I panel. To go back to the original list of
links, click the Topics icon at the top right of the panel.
The Browser/Editor
The main work area is called the Browser/Editor (we call it the Browser to
save space). The Browser has two modes, Browse and Edit, and you can
only be in one mode at a time. The appearance and functionality of the
Browser depend on which mode you’re in.
When you’re in Browse mode in the Browser, you can navigate anywhere a
regular Web browser, such as Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator, could
take you. When you’re in Edit mode, you can make changes to a Web page.
Browse mode
In order to browse to a page you want to update, you must use the Browser
in its Browse mode. You can tell when the Browser is in Browse mode by look-
ing at the buttons at the top. The following buttons (as shown in Figure 1-4)
allow you to navigate as you would using any browser, like IE or Navigator:
✦Back: Click this button to view the previous page you were viewing in
the Browser. You can step back one at a time through each of the pages
you viewed since you opened the browser. The Back option in the View
menu performs the same function.
✦Forward: Click Forward to go one page at a time from pages you viewed
earlier to pages you viewed most recently.

✦Stop: Pages with lots of big images or complex Flash movies sometimes
take awhile to load in the Browser. Click this button to stop a page from
loading further in the Browser.
✦Refresh: As with your regular Web browser’s Refresh button, this
button reloads the current Web page in the Contribute Browser.
The rest of the buttons are specific to the Contribute Browser:
✦Edit Page: Click this button to edit the page you have browsed to. When
you click Edit, Contribute downloads the page and automatically sets
the Browser to Edit mode. This option is not available if you don’t have
what Contribute calls a connection — that is, permission to edit the page.
✦New Page: Click this button to create a new page on the current Web
site. You will be prompted to name the page and, if you desire, to choose
a page or template to use as a basis for the new page. See Book VII,
Chapter 2 for more details.
✦Home pages: Use this button to navigate quickly to the home pages of
the sites to which you have Contribute connections. Click and hold to
see a drop-down list of eligible home pages.
✦Go: This button works in conjunction with the Address text input field.
See the following instructions for browsing to a page on the Internet.
✦Choose: Click this button to open a dialog box in which you can navi-
gate quickly to any page on the Web site you’re currently updating.
To browse to a page on the Internet, just follow these simple steps:
1. Type or paste a URL (such as www.earlsbowlateria.com) into the
Address field at the top of the Browser.
2. Click the Go button at the right of the address input field or press
Enter.
The requested Web page opens in the Browser.
When you browse to a site you have been set up to edit with Contribute, the
top left of the Browser toolbar has two buttons: Edit Page and New Page.
Figure 1-4:

(Refer to Figure 1-4). When you browse to a page you are not set up to edit
with Contribute, the Edit Page and New Page buttons are replaced by the
Create Connection button (see the section on connecting to a site in Book VII,
Chapter 2 for more information on creating connections).
Edit mode
The Edit mode is what Contribute is all about: It’s the mode that you use to
make changes to Web pages. To get into Edit mode after you’ve browsed to
an editable page, do one of the following:
✦Click the Edit Page button at the top left of the Browser
or
✦Choose File➪Edit Page or use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Shift+E
To get into Edit mode if you haven’t yet browsed to a page you have permis-
sion to edit, click the name of an existing Draft in the Pages panel (or click
the icon next to the name). The Draft opens in the Browser, and the Browser
automatically switches to Edit mode.
Most of Book VII, Chapter 2 is about the things you can do in Edit mode, so
if you’re anxious to get to work on a site, skip ahead to the next chapter.
Menus
The Contribute menu bar sports eight menus, each of which includes sev-
eral choices. (Many of the choices are also available from buttons at the top
of the Browser.) We give you some details about the first three menus, as
well as brief descriptions of what the other five offer:
✦File: Every computer program has a File menu, with options like Open,
Save, and the like. The Contribute File menu offers the following:
• New Page: Select this option to create a new Web page. You can
create a new page from scratch, from an existing page, or from a
Dreamweaver MX 2004 template. See Book VII, Chapter 2 for details.
• Edit Page: This option is only available when the Browser is in
Browse mode and is currently displaying a page you have permis-
sion to edit. When you select File➪Edit Page, Contribute downloads
the page to your computer and makes it available for modification.
Clicking the Edit Page button in the Browser does the same thing.
• Publish: Select this option to upload an edited page to the server.
• Publish as New Page: Select this option to upload a page to the
server with a new filename (such as aboutus.htm). You’re
prompted to type or paste in the new filename. See Book VII,
Chapter 2 for details.

Exploring the Contribute Interface
740
• Save: Select this option to save the work you have done on a draft
without publishing the edited page. After you have saved, you may
continue work on the draft.
• Save for Later: Select this option to save the work you have done on
a draft without publishing the edited page; the Browser will automat-
ically change from Edit mode to Browse mode and load the last page
you were looking at in Browse mode.
• Cancel Draft: Select this to delete the draft you’re currently working
on from your computer. Note: Selecting Cancel Draft will not delete
the page from your Web site.
• Preview in Browser: Select this to see what your draft looks like in
your regular browser (IE, Navigator, Opera, Safari, and so on).
• E-mail Review: Select this to upload a temporary version of your
page to the server and send an e-mail to a coworker with a link to
the temporary page. If you need someone’s approval before you pub-
lish a page (make it live on the site so users can see it), E-mail Review
is a handy automated way to show your work to the person who can
approve it.
• Export: Select Export to save a copy of the page you’re working on
to your local hard drive (or to a removable disk or remote hard
drive).
• Page Setup: Select this option to open a dialog box that allows you
to customize how your printer deals with your page (paper size, ori-
entation, and so on).
• Print: As you might expect, you can print your Web page by select-
ing Print from the File menu.
• Print Preview: Select Print Preview to see on your computer screen
a representation of how your Web page will appear on paper when
you print it.
• Roll Back to Previous Version: If you find you’ve published a page
that has a mistake on it, select Roll Back to Previous Version to
restore the previously published version of the page. See Book VII,
Chapter 3 for more information on this feature, which must be set
up by an administrator.
• Delete Page: Select Delete Page to remove a page from your Web
site. This option is available only when the Browser is in Browse
mode.
• Work Offline: Select this option if you don’t need to upload or
download any unpublished drafts you’re editing, or if you’re tem-
porarily unable to connect with your network or the Internet.
• Drafts: Use this option to open an unpublished draft of a page.

• Recently Published Pages: Use this option to view in the Browser a
page you recently published.
• Exit: Select this option to close Contribute. You can also close
Contribute by pressing Ctrl+Q or Alt+F4 on your keyboard.
✦Edit: The options under the Edit menu include such perennial favorites
as Cut and Paste, as well as a few Contribute-specific options. Which
options are “live” (not grayed out) at any given time depends on your
most recent action. (Figure 1-5 shows the Edit menu after some text has
been cut from the current draft.)
• Undo: Select this option to undo your most recent actions in a draft,
one at a time. You can’t use Undo to alter a published page; for that,
you need to choose File➪Roll Back. The keyboard shortcut for Undo
is Ctrl+Z.
• Redo: Redo is sort of an undo of an undo. Select this option to redo
the last actions you undid in your draft, one at a time, or use the key-
board shortcut Ctrl+Y.
• Cut: Select this option to remove highlighted text or objects from
your draft. You can then paste the text or objects into the same
page, a different page, or even a different kind of document (for
example, a Word document). The keyboard shortcut to cut high-
lighted objects is Ctrl+X.
• Paste: After you’ve selected some text and/or objects (like images,
for example), select this option to paste the text and/or objects into
your draft, or use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+V.
• Paste Text Only: After selecting a block of text that also includes
images or other objects, you can use this option to paste only the
text from your selection. You can also use the keyboard shortcut
Ctrl+Shift+V.
• Clear: Use this option to remove selected text or objects from your
Web page. Unlike Cut, this option does not allow you to paste the
removed text or objects elsewhere.

• Select All: Use this option to select everything in a draft. You can
then cut, paste, or clear everything at once. The keyboard shortcut
for select all is Ctrl+A.
• Preferences: Select this option to open a dialog box that allows you
to customize the way Contribute works. See the “Setting Preferences”
section, later in this chapter, for details.
• My Connections: Use this option to view, edit, and delete the con-
nections you have to the sites you maintain.
• Administer Websites: If you have Administrator privileges on any
sites to which you have connections, use this option to open the
Administration dialog box and change any settings for the selected
site. See Book VII, Chapter 3 for information on sitewide settings,
permission groups, and setting up users.
✦View: The View menu offers options related to what you see on-screen
in Contribute.
• Sidebar: Select this option to show or hide the sidebar, which con-
tains the Pages and How Do I panels.
• Browser: Select this option to switch to the Browse mode of the
Browser. The last page you looked at in that mode appears in
the Browser. You can use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Shift+B or
click the top line in the Pages panel to do the same thing.
• Go to Web Address: If you select this option, a dialog box opens in
which you can type or paste a URL to open a particular Web page in
the Browser. When you click OK, the Browser switches to Browse
mode — if it wasn’t already in Browse mode — and loads the page
you requested. You can also use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+O to
open the Go to Web Address dialog box.
• Choose File on Website: This option allows you to navigate directly
to an editable page from a window that displays all the sites to
which you have a Contribute connection.
The Back, Forward, Stop, Refresh, and Home Pages options function
just like their corresponding buttons in the Browser. See the “Browse
mode” section, earlier in this chapter, for the skinny on them.
✦Bookmarks: A bookmark is a link to a Web page. Options here allow you
to add and delete bookmarks to Web pages you visit often. If your main
Web browser is IE, you see all your IE bookmarks listed under the Other
Bookmarks option.
✦Insert: Select an option in this menu to insert an item into a draft. The
Insert menu allows you to insert the following items into a draft:

✦Format: You can use the options in this menu to format selected text
in a draft. You can apply CSS styles, as well as more traditional HTML
text treatments like bold and italic. See Book VII, Chapter 2 for details
on text formatting in Contribute. The Format menu also gives you access
to the Contribute Spell Check (keyboard shortcut: F7) and to edit Page
Properties, such as title and background color (keyboard shortcut:
Ctrl+J).
✦Table: This menu offers commands that allow you to insert and edit
tables in your draft.
✦Help: The Help menu gives you a choice of several kinds of help:
• Macromedia Contribute Help: Select this option to view standard
help files, with step-by-step instructions.
• Quick Start Guide: Select this option to see instructions on the
basics of Contribute to help get you up and running quickly.
• Contribute Support Center: When you select this option, your 
regular Web browser opens to the Contribute Support home page
on Macromedia’s Web site.
• Contribute Tutorial: Select this option to access a set of guided les-
sons on basic tasks you can perform with Contribute.
The Help menu also allows you to open the Contribute Welcome page
in the Browser, print your Contribute registration form or submit your
registration online, and see the About Contribute window, which
shows information about the version of Contribute you’re running.
The Insert, Format, and Table menus give you ways to perform tasks we dis-
cuss in more detail in Book VII, Chapter 2.
Setting Preferences
For most users, the default Preferences should suffice, but you may wish to
(or need to) make a few changes in order to use Contribute most efficiently.
To open the Preferences dialog box, choose Edit➪Preferences.

Setting Preferences
744
The Preferences dialog box includes five “screens”; you access the different
screens by selecting one of the items in the list on the left side of the dialog
box (see Figure 1-6). A brief overview of each page follows.
Setting general preferences
The General screen of the Preferences dialog box has two sections:
✦Editing Options
• Faster Table Editing (Deferred Update): This check box is selected
by default. Deselect this check box if you want Contribute to update
the way tables appear on-screen as you edit them, which may slow
down other Contribute operations.
• Enable ScreenReader Support: Select this check box if you have a
visual impairment that hinders your ability to work with Contribute.
• Spelling Dictionary: Choose a dictionary language from the drop-
down list. Contribute uses the dictionary to spell-check Web page
drafts.
✦Microsoft Office Documents: You can choose one of the following
options for the way Contribute treats a Word document or Excel
spreadsheet when you insert it into a draft.
• Insert the Contents of the Document into the Current Web Page:
Choose this option if you want Contribute to convert the contents
of the document into HTML.
• Insert a FlashPaper Viewer for the Document into the Page: Use
this option if you want to use Contribute’s new FlashPaper technol-
ogy to convert the document. See Book VII, Chapter 4 for details.
• Create a Link to the Document (Recommended for Large Docu-
ments): Use this option if you want Contribute to upload the Office

document to your Web site and put a link to the document in the
draft you’re currently editing.
• Ask Whenever I Insert a Microsoft Office File into Contribute: Use
this option if you need to handle inserting Office documents into your
Web pages on a case-by-case basis. This option is selected by default.
Setting file editor preferences
You can tell Contribute what application you want it to use to open various
types of files when you double-click the files in the Browser in Edit mode. To
set Contribute to open a particular type of file with a particular application,
just follow these steps:
1. Select File Editors from the list on the left side of the Preferences
dialog box.
The File Editors options appear, as shown in Figure 1-7.
2. If the extension is not already listed in the Extensions list box, click
the + button above the Extensions box (if the extension is already
listed in the Extensions box, skip to Step 4).
A cursor blinks at the bottom of the list.
3. Type the name of the extension, including the dot (for example, type
.wav for a WAV audio file) and press Enter.
The extension you typed in remains highlighted.
4. If the application is not already listed, click the + button above the
Editors box (if the application is listed, click its name to select it and
skip to Step 6).
The Select External Editor dialog box pops up.

5. Navigate to the application and double-click its icon, or type the path-
name (including the application name) into the File Name text field.
The application name appears in the Editors box.
6. Set any other file editor preferences and click OK when you’ve
finished.
Contribute comes with quite a few defaults (naturally, Macromedia Studio
MX 2004 applications feature prominently), so you may never need to touch
the File Editors preferences. You can assign more than one application to edit
a particular file type. If you do that, you need to designate one of the pro-
grams as the primary application by selecting it in the File Editors screen
of the Preferences dialog box and clicking the Make Primary button.
Setting firewall preferences
If your computer is separated by a firewall from the server that houses your
site (or sites), use the Firewall screen of the Preferences dialog box to input
the host name and port number that allow you to tunnel through the firewall.
If you’re not sure what all that means, ask someone in your IT department.
Setting invisible element preferences
When you link some text or an image to a particular line on a Web page,
you need to place an invisible target (an anchor) at that line. Select Invisible
Elements in the list box on the left of the Preferences dialog box to see the
Invisible Elements options. Leave the Show Section Anchors When Editing a
Page check box selected if you want to be able to see icons that identify
where invisible anchor links are in your draft.
Setting security preferences
If you share a computer with other people and don’t want them to have
access to Contribute (and therefore to the sites you maintain), open up the
Security options on the Preferences dialog box and select the Require
Contribute Startup Password check box. Then follow these steps:
1. Click in the Password text field, type a password, and press the
Tab key.
The cursor moves to the Confirm Password text field.
2. Retype your password in the Confirm Password text field exactly as
you typed it in the Password text field above. Press Enter or click OK.
Contribute will ask for a password when you launch the application.
You can change your preferences at any time by choosing Edit➪Preferences.

T
he new and improved Macromedia Contribute, bearing the daringly
original title “Contribute 2,” is a remarkably easy-to-use tool for editing
existing Web pages on — or adding new pages to — a Web site. As with the
original version of Contribute, many of the things you need to do to add or
replace content on a page (or build a page based on an existing design) take
little more than a click. And you don’t have to know a thing about HTML.
With Contribute 2, Macromedia has improved upon the original version
of the application while keeping it simple enough for nontechnical users —
no small task. This chapter is all about how using the Contribute 2 tools can
make modifying or creating a basic Web page easier. If you need to know
about things like setting yourself up as a site administrator or sending a
connection key to a fellow site contributor, see Book VII, Chapter 3.
Connecting to a Site
In order to put Contribute 2 to use when working on a Web site, you must
be connected to that site. Being connected means establishing an FTP (File
Transfer Protocol) connection between your computer and the remote server
that your site lives on. If that sounds complicated, don’t worry. It’s actually
pretty simple.
You can connect in two ways:
✦By using a connection key that the site administrator has e-mailed to you
✦By entering information in the Connection Wizard

Connecting to a Site
748
Both ways are pretty simple, but you’ll need some information about your
Web server to employ the latter method. If you’ve been sent a connection
key, read the next section to find out how to use it. If you need to connect to
a site but don’t have a key, skip ahead to the “Connecting to a site with the
Connection Wizard” section.
Connecting to a site with the connection key
A connection key is an encrypted file that contains nearly all the information
Contribute needs to connect your copy of Contribute to the Web site you’ll
be updating. (You also need to get a password from your administrator.) You
might receive a connection key
✦Via e-mail sent to you by the site administrator
✦By downloading it from your local network
Most likely, you’ll get your connection key via e-mail, but it works the same
either way (just skip Step 2 below). To open a connection to the Web site
you’ll be working on, just follow these simple steps:
1. Open the e-mail from your site administrator that contains the con-
nection key.
The connection key shows up as an attachment (see Figure 2-1). The
body of the e-mail contains instructions on using the key. The name of
the connection key is based on the name the site administrator has
given the site connection in Contribute.
2. Double-click the connection key.
Contribute starts up (if it’s not already open), and the Import
Connection Key dialog box opens.
3. If your name is not already there, click in the What Is Your Name? text
field and type your name. Press Tab or click in the E-mail text field.
4. If your e-mail address is not already there, type your e-mail address
in the next field. Press Tab or click in the next text field.
If you already have a connection to another Web site, your e-mail
address may already be entered in the field.
5. In the What Is the Connection Key Password? text field, type the pass-
word given to you by the site administrator.
The password may have been sent in a separate e-mail or told to you
on the phone. If you don’t yet know the password, check with the site
administrator.

6. Click OK.
The Contribute Browser loads the site’s home page.
The connection key should have all the FTP information that allows you to
connect to your Web server. In some cases, you may have to input the FTP
information manually. The next section tells you how.
Connecting to a site with the Connection Wizard
Contribute saves you the trouble of having to use an FTP client to move Web
pages back and forth between your computer and the server that hosts your
Web site. When you click the Edit button in the Browser, Contribute auto-
matically gets (downloads) the page for editing. When you click the Publish
button, Contribute puts (uploads) the page to the Web server. After you’ve
set up a connection, Contribute handles all the getting and putting of files
seamlessly.
The Connection Wizard makes connecting to a remote Web server a snap, if
you have the login information at hand. Just follow these steps to set up a
connection, after you have opened Contribute:

Connecting to a Site
750
1. Type or paste the URL for your site (for example, http://www.
mysite.com) into the Address field of the Contribute Browser and
either press Enter or click the Go button.
The Contribute Browser takes you right to your site.
You can use the Contribute Browser to view any site on the Web, but
you can only set up a connection to a site if you have FTP information
for that site.
2. Click the Create Connection button at the top left of the Browser.
The Connection Wizard opens to its Welcome screen.
3. We’re assuming you don’t have a connection key, so click the Next
button at the bottom of the wizard.
The User Information screen appears.
4. Enter your name in the What Is Your Name? text field.
Your name may already appear. The name in this field will identify you
to other contributors to your site, if there are any.
5. If it’s not already there, enter your e-mail address in the What Is Your
E-mail Address? text field, and then click Next.
The Website Home Page screen appears.
6. Enter the URL (http://www.mysite.com, for example) for the Web
site you’ll be editing into the text field, and then click Next.
You can also click the Browse button, which will open a browser
window you can use to navigate to the site.
When you click Next, the Connection Information screen appears in the
wizard.
7. Select a connection method from the drop-down list.
You have the following options: FTP, Secure FTP (SFTP), and Local/
Network. If you’re not sure what to select, check with your IT person or
site administrator. Depending on what you choose, different text fields
appear below the drop-down list. As you can see in Figure 2-2, we’ve
entered FTP.
8a. If you selected FTP or SFTP, enter the FTP server name (for example,
ftp.earlsbowlateria.com), the FTP login (sometimes called the
username), and the FTP password in the respective text fields. Click
Next.
If the site already has an administrator, the Group Information screen
appears (go to Step 9a). If the site doesn’t yet have an administrator,
the Administrator Information screen appears (go to Step 9b).

8b. If you selected Local/Network, enter the network path (for example,
\\mynetwork\mydepartment\site) by typing or pasting it in, or by
clicking the Choose Folder button and browsing in your network to
the folder that contains your site. Click Next.
If the site already has an administrator, the Group Information screen
appears (go to Step 9a). If the site doesn’t yet have an administrator,
the Administrator Information screen appears (go to Step 9b).
9a. If you plan to be the site administrator, click Administrator. Otherwise,
click User. If your administrator has given you a different group name
to use, it should appear in the list on the left, where you should click
it. Then click Next.
Contribute has two default categories for contributors: Users, who
can perform basic page editing tasks, and Administrators, who can do
everything Users can do and also perform additional tasks (like decid-
ing whether other contributors are Users or Administrators). If you are
going to be an administrator, go to step 9b.
9b. Enter a password in the top text field on the Administrator Information
screen. Then re-enter the password in the text field below, exactly as
you typed it above. Click Next.
You can use any combination of numbers and letters for your password.
The password is case-sensitive (so as far as the password is concerned,
a big “S” and a small “s” are different characters). Only contributors
who know that password will be able to perform administrator func-
tions on the site. For more information on Administrator functions,
see Book VII, Chapter 3.
10. Congratulations! You’ve made it to the Summary screen. Make sure
the information is correct. If it isn’t, use the Back button to go to the
screen with incorrect info and fix the mistake; then use the Next
button to return to the Summary screen. Click Done.

Unless any of the information you put in the Connection Wizard changes,
you never have to think about it again — from here on in, you can just get
straight to work making changes to your site.
Opening an Existing Page for Editing
After you’ve established a connection to your site, you’re ready to start
making changes to existing pages and even creating new ones. Downloading
a page to edit is extremely easy — just follow these steps:
1. Type or paste the URL of the page you want to edit (for example,
http://www.mysite.com) into the Address field of the Contribute
Browser and either press Enter or click the Go button.
The Browser loads your page, and the Edit Page and New Page buttons
appear at the top left of the Browser. If the page is not available for edit-
ing, the warning You are viewing a page on a Web site that you
haven’t created a connection to appears under the Address field in
the Browser.
2. Click the Edit Page button.
The Browser switches to Edit mode, and the page appears as a draft in
the Browser. The Browser’s toolbar at the top changes to show buttons
for inserting links, images, tables, and text, as shown in Figure 2-3.

Creating a New Page
753
Creating a New Page
If opening a page for editing is a snap, creating a new page is maybe
three snaps. To create a new page for your site, follow these simple 
steps:
1. If you have connections to more than one Web site, use the Contribute
Browser to browse to the site to which you want to add a page. Other-
wise, skip to Step 2.
The Browser loads your page, and the Edit Page and New Page buttons
appear at the top left of the Browser. If the site is not available for edit-
ing, the warning You are viewing a page on a Web site that you
haven’t created a connection to appears under the Address field
in the Browser.
2. Click the New Page button, or choose File➪New Page.
The New Page dialog box appears.
3a. If you want the new page to have the same basic appearance and
structure (for example, to have the same navigation items and basic
layout) as the page currently showing in your browser, click the Copy
of Current Page option in the Create New Page From pane of the New
Page dialog box.
3b. If you want to create a page from a Dreamweaver MX 2004 template,
click the template name in the Create New Page From pane.
If the templates are in a folder and you don’t see them, click the plus (+)
sign next to the folder that holds the templates; the contents of the
folder will appear. A preview of the template appears in the Preview
pane, as shown in Figure 2-4.
3c. If you want to start the page from scratch, skip to Step 4. (Blank Web
Page is selected by default.)
The Blank Web Page option may not be available to you, depending on
how the administrator has set up your connection.
4. Type or paste a page title in the Page Title text field. Click OK.
Your new page opens in the Browser, as a draft ready for editing.
The page title will appear at the top of the Web browser’s window when
people view your Web site.
You can also create a new page by using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+N.

Working with Text
754
Working with Text
Text is often the most abundant element on a Web site. Contribute makes
adding, formatting, and deleting text a piece of cake.
Adding text
To add text to a draft (that is, to a page that’s ready for editing; see the pre-
vious sections, “Opening an Existing Page for Editing” or “Creating a New
Page”), just follow these easy steps:
1. Click the place in the draft where you want to insert text.
A cursor blinks in the spot you selected.
2. Type or paste the text.
You may need to format the text. See the “Formatting Text” section for
the low-down.
Formatting text
Text formatting entails everything from setting a font face and font size to
emphasizing words or phrases by making them bold or italic, to creating
numbered or bulleted lists. It’s all as easy as clicking a button in Contribute.
You can format text either before or after you insert it on a page. If you’re
working from a template, text areas may be preformatted for things like font

size, color, and font face. If not, the text you insert will conform to the set-
tings in the text toolbar (the second row of the Browser).
Setting a text style
To set the font style, choose a style from the Style drop-down list at the top
left. If you have CSS styles attached to your page, they will appear in the
menu; otherwise, your choices are Normal and Heading 1 (largest) through
Heading 6 (smallest).
Setting a text face
To set a face for your font (for example, Arial, Verdana, and so on), choose
one from the Font drop-down list to the right of the Style list. If you leave the
setting at “Default,” the text’s appearance will be determined by the browser
settings of a visitor to your site.
Setting a text size
Choose a text size from the Size drop-down list. The smallest is 8 (too small
for anything but the proverbial “fine print”), and the largest is 36. If you
select “Default,” the text’s size will be determined by the browser settings
of a visitor to your site. Figure 2-5 shows just some of the ways you can
format text.
Figure 2-5:
You can
format text
in many
different
ways.

Working with Text
756
Selecting text
To select text, click and drag over the text you want to select. The selected
text is highlighted. If you change the text style, font face, size, color, or back-
ground color settings while text in your draft is selected, the selected text
(and only the selected text) will change to reflect the new settings.
Aligning text
Contribute allows you to align text to the left, center, or right, or to justify
the text at the left and right (though the latter is extremely rare on the Web).
To align text, place the cursor anywhere in the block of text you want to align
(or select a block of text by clicking and dragging) and click an Align button
(from left to right, the Align buttons are Align Left, Align Center, Align Right,
and Justify).
Adding boldness to your text
To make some text bold, follow these steps:
1. Select the text by clicking and dragging until all the text you want
bold is highlighted.
2. Click the Bold button or use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+B.
The selected text becomes bold.
You can remove the bold formatting from text by following the same steps.
Italicizing your text
To italicize some text, follow these steps:
1. Select the text by clicking and dragging until all the text you want
changed is highlighted.
2. Click the Italic button or use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+I.
The selected text becomes italicized.
You can remove the italic formatting from text by following the same steps.
Changing the text color
Web text is typically black by default but can be set to default to other
colors. If you’re working with CSS styles or Dreamweaver templates, default
text colors may be set for you already.
To change the color of a specific block of text, follow these steps:

Book VII

757
1. Select the text by clicking and dragging until all the text you want
changed is highlighted.
2. Click the Text Color button in the Browser’s Text toolbar.
The Text Color button is the one on the second row toward the right
with a capital A on it. When you click it, the Color Picker pops up.
3. Click on a cube of color with the eyedropper to make the selected
text that color.
For details on how to use the advanced features of the Color Picker, see
the section on adding color in Book III, Chapter 3.
Changing the text background color
When you change the text background color, you’re changing just that: the
background of each chunk of text, be it letters or numbers.
To change the text background color of some text, follow these simple steps:
1. Select the text by clicking and dragging until all the text you want
changed is highlighted.
2. Click the Highlight Color button in the Browser’s Text toolbar, as
shown in Figure 2-6.
The Highlight Color button is the one with the highlighter marker; it’s
just to the right of the Text Color button. When you click on the
Highlight Color button, the Color Picker pops up.
3. Click on a cube of color with the eyedropper to make the background
of selected text that color.

Creating a numbered list
You can create a numbered list the fancy way, with complicated tables and
such, or you can do it the easy way, using the numbered list convention
built into HTML. Contribute makes the easy way even easier. To create a
numbered list, just follow these steps:
1. Click the Numbered List button in the Browser’s toolbar, as shown in
Figure 2-7.
The indented number 1 appears, followed by a period, a space and a
blinking cursor.
2. Type the first item in your numbered list. Press Enter when you’re
finished.
The number 2 automatically appears on the next line, followed by a
period, a space, and a blinking cursor.
3. Type the second item in your numbered list, press Enter, and con-
tinue to enter items until you have completed your list.
Leave the extra number you don’t have an item for.
4. Click the Numbered List button to deactivate the numbering.
The last (extra) number disappears, and the cursor goes to its non-
indented position below the list.

Creating a bulleted list
HTML has a specification for bulleted lists just as it does for numbered lists.
Contribute knows the specification so you don’t have to.
To create a bulleted list, simply follow these steps:
1. Click the Bulleted List button in the Browser’s toolbar.
An indented bullet appears, followed by a little space and a blinking
cursor.
2. Type the first bullet item and press the Enter key.
A bullet appears on the next line, followed by a little space and a blink-
ing cursor.
3. Type the second bullet item, press the Enter key, and repeat the
process until you have completed your list.
An extra bullet remains temporarily at the bottom of your list.
4. Click the Bulleted List button to deactivate the bulleting.
The last (extra) bullet disappears, and the cursor goes to its non-
indented position below the list.
Working with Tables
You might use tables on a Web page in two basic ways:
✦To display tabular information, such as a spreadsheet
✦To control page layout
No matter which function you want the table to have, you can add, modify,
and delete the table using the same simple methods. Tables are made up
of cells, arranged in rows and columns. Picture a basic tic-tac-toe game. It’s
played on a kind of table, with nine cells arranged in three rows and three
columns. If you can draw a tic-tac-toe game, you can make a table on a Web
page.
Inserting a table
To insert a table into your page, just follow these steps:
1. Click the spot in your draft where you want the top-left corner of the
table to go.
A blinking cursor marks the spot.

Working with Tables
760
2. Click the Insert Table button in the top row of the Browser toolbar.
The Insert Table dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 2-8.
3. Enter the number of rows you want the table to have into the Number
of Rows field.
You can always add more rows or delete extra rows later, if you need to.
4. In the Number of Columns field, enter the number of columns you
want the table to have.
You can always add more columns or delete extra columns later.
5a. If it doesn’t matter how wide the table is, leave the Default Width set-
ting as is and skip to Step 6. 
5b. If you have a particular width you want the table to be, select the
Specific Width radio button, enter a number for the width of your
table, and then choose either Pixels or Percent from the drop-down
list to the right.
If you choose Pixels, the table will be the number of pixels wide that you
specified. If you choose Percent, you must choose a numeral between 1
and 100; the table’s width will vary according to the overall page layout,
and it may vary according to the width of the browser window of a visi-
tor to your site.
6. In the Border Thickness field, enter a number for how many pixels
thick you want the border of your table to be.
If you don’t want the table border to show (which you probably don’t if
you’re using the table for page layout purposes), enter 0 (zero).

7. In the Cell Padding field, enter a number for the amount of pixels you
want between the border of the cell and the text or object inside the
cell.
The cell padding applies to the top, bottom, left, and right of the inside
of each and every cell.
8. In the Cell Spacing field, enter a number for the amount of pixels you
want between the cells.
The cell spacing applies to the whole table; you can’t have different cell
spacing for individual rows or columns.
9. If your table has a header row or header column (or both), click the
icon that represents the header structure of your table.
Figure 2-9 shows a table with a single header row. The text in that row is
automatically bold and center-aligned in the cells.
10. Click OK.
The Insert Table dialog box closes, and an empty table appears in your
draft, built to your specifications and ready to be filled with content.
Adding information to a table
Adding text and images to a table is pretty much the same as adding them
anywhere else on a draft. To add text to a table, follow these steps:
1. Click in the cell where you want to put the text.
A cursor blinks in the cell.
Figure 2-9:

to the
specifica-
tions shown

2. Type or paste in the text.
The cell expands downwards. In some cases, the cell also expands to
the right, depending on the width of the cell and the nature of the text.
For example, a long e-mail address, which is made of many characters
strung together without a space, can stretch a cell. (Refer to Figure 2-9.)
The other cells may become narrower to compensate.
3. Click in another cell or outside the table if you want to add more
information to the table or elsewhere on the draft.
To add an image or other object to a cell, click in the cell and then follow the
directions in the “Adding Images, Links, and More” section, later in this
chapter.
Modifying a table
You can modify many properties of an existing table quickly and easily. In
some cases, you can make the changes by clicking and dragging table or cell
borders; in other cases, you can enter new settings in the Table Properties
dialog box.
Changing the whole table using the Table Properties dialog box
To make changes to the entire table at once, follow these steps:
1. Select the table by placing your cursor over the top-left or bottom-left
corner of the table until the cursor changes into a four-pointed arrow
and clicking.
The border of the table highlights.
2. Click the Table button on the Browser toolbar.
Yes, it’s the same button you click to insert a table, but when you’ve
selected a table that’s already there, the button opens the Table
Properties dialog box. The dialog box has two tabs: the Table tab and
the Row and Column tab. (The default view opens to the Table tab, as
shown in Figure 2-10.)
3. Select an alignment for the table from the Table Alignment drop-
down list.
A table can be justified left, center, or right.
4. Change the table width, border thickness, cell padding, and cell spac-
ing as needed.
For more information on those table properties, see the “Inserting a
table” section, earlier in this chapter.

and use the Color Picker to choose a color.
For details on how to use the advanced features of the Color Picker, see
the section on adding color in Book III, Chapter 3.
6. To change the color of the table’s background, click the Background
Color icon and use the Color Picker to choose a color.
Book III, Chapter 3 gives details on how to use the advanced features of
the Color Picker.
7. To change other properties of the table, click the Row and Column
tab at the top of the dialog box.
The Row and Column options appear. If you have selected only a row
and not the whole table, the tab will say only Row. Likewise, if you have
selected only a column and not the whole table, the tab will read Column.
8. To change the horizontal alignment of the elements in each cell,
select an option from the Horizontal Alignment drop-down list.
Your options are Default, Left, Center, and Right. Choosing Default
allows the visitor’s browser to set how the elements in the cells are
aligned.
9. To change the vertical alignment of elements in each cell, select an
option from the Vertical Alignment drop-down list.
Your options are Default, Top, Middle, and Bottom. Choosing Default
allows the visitor’s browser to set how the elements in the cells are
aligned.
10. To change the background color for the cells in the table, click the
Background Color icon and use the Color Picker to choose a color.

11. If you want the table’s column width to be allotted automatically,
select the Fit to Contents radio button. If you want to set the column
widths to a specific number of pixels or percentage of the overall
table width, select the radio button underneath the Fit to Contents
radio button, enter a number in the text field, and select either Pixels
or Percent from the drop-down list.
If you insert something in a cell that is wider than you have set the
column to handle, the cell will override your column width setting to
accommodate the element, be it an image or a long string of text.
12. If you want to keep all the text on a single line within the cells, dese-
lect the Wrap Text check box. Otherwise, leave the Wrap Text check
box selected.
If all the text in a cell won’t fit on a single line and the Wrap Text box is
checked, the text will be split into as many lines as are necessary, given
the width of the cell. The line breaks come at spaces, dashes, and car-
riage returns. Deselecting the Wrap Text option may increase the width
of your table.
13. If you’ve selected the entire table, leave the Header Row check box
alone.
If you’ve selected a row, you can make it a header row by selecting the
Header Row check box, or removing its header row formatting by dese-
lecting the Header Row check box.
14. If you want the row heights in your table to be determined by the
content in the rows (each row is only as large as the biggest cell in
that row), select the Fit to Contents radio button next to the Row
Height section. If you want to set a row height in pixels, select the
radio button below the Fit to Contents radio button and enter a
number for the height you want the row to be in pixels.
15. When you’ve made all the changes you want, click OK.
At any time while you are changing settings, you can click the Apply
button to see the effect of the changes before moving on to the next
property.
Changing rows, columns, or individual cells 
using the Table Properties dialog box
There may be times when you want to change the text alignment in some
cells but not others, or you want to perform some other task that applies
only to a particular row or column. In those circumstances, you need to
select only the cells you want to affect; then you can make the changes
using the Table Properties dialog box.

Adding Images, Links, and More
Adding images to a page is a snap with Contribute. In a way, it’s easier than
adding a table, because there are fewer properties you need to set. Same
goes for adding Flash movies to a page.
Inserting an image
If the image you want to insert in your page is on your computer’s hard
drive, just follow these steps to insert it:
1. Place your cursor in the draft and click where you want to add the
image.
The cursor blinks where the top-left corner of your image will appear on
the page. You can insert an image in a table cell or anywhere else on the
page.
2. Choose Insert➪Image➪From My Computer or use the keyboard short-
cut Ctrl+Alt+I.
The Select Image dialog box appears.
3. Navigate to the folder the image is in, and then either double-click the
image’s file name, or click the filename and click Select.
The image is placed in your draft. When you publish the page, Contribute
automatically uploads the image. Your site administrator can set a maxi-
mum file size for any image uploaded to your site. If you get an error
message saying your image is too big, see your site administrator or 
re-export the image from Fireworks at a smaller file size.
Inserting a Flash movie
Adding a Flash movie to your page from your computer’s hard drive is easy.
Just follow these steps:
1. Place your cursor in the draft and click where you want to add the
Flash movie.
The cursor blinks where the top left of your movie will appear on the
page. You can insert movie in a table cell or anywhere else on the page.
2. Select Insert➪Flash Movie➪From My Computer.
The Open dialog box appears.
3. Navigate to the folder the movie is in, and then either double-click
the Flash movie’s file name, or click the filename and click Open.
The Flash movie is placed in your draft. When you publish the page,
Contribute automatically uploads the .swf file.

767
Flash movies have parameters that can be set on a Web page that will affect
how the movies appear and function, but Contribute only gives you access
to a couple of them. To make these (limited) changes, select the movie
by clicking it and then select Format➪Flash Movie Properties to open the
Flash Movie Properties dialog box and set the Play on Page Load and Loop
properties.
Inserting a link
Links (short for hyperlinks) are what the Web is all about, so naturally
Contribute allows you to add links to your pages. You can link from both text
and images, and you can link to other pages on your site, other pages on the
Web, e-mail addresses, and things like PDF files.
Linking to a Web page
To add a link from text or an image to a page on your Web site or any other
Web site, just follow these steps:
1. Click an image or click and drag to select some text that you want to
link to another page on the Web.
The image or text highlights.
2. Select Insert➪Link➪Browse to Web Page.
The Insert Link dialog box opens, with Browse to Web Page selected at
the top, as shown in Figure 2-12.

3. Enter a URL (for example, http://www.mysite.com/contactus.htm)
in the Web Address text field, or click the Browse button to browse to
the page you want to link to.
Browsing to the page is often the best way to ensure that you link to the
correct page. The page you browsed to appears in the Preview area on
the right.
4. Click OK.
You’ve just created a hyperlink.
Linking to an e-mail address
When you link to an e-mail address, the link on your Web page opens up a
new e-mail message in your visitor’s e-mail program. The e-mail is automati-
cally addressed to the e-mail address you specify in the link.
To add an e-mail link to some text or an image:
1. Click and drag to select some text or click on an image that you want
to link to an e-mail address.
The image or text highlights.
2. Select Insert➪Link➪E-mail Address.
The Insert Link dialog box opens, with E-mail Address selected at the top.
3. Enter the e-mail address in the E-mail Address text field.
4. Click OK.
The selected text or image links to the e-mail address.
Linking to an e-mail address will open the visitor’s e-mail program only if the
visitor’s e-mail program is set up to open when such a link is clicked. Most
current e-mail programs are set up by default to handle an e-mail link.
You can also link to other drafts, to new pages, and to files on your computer
(like Word documents and PDF files). See Contribute’s Help files for details
on how to perform those tasks, or check out Macromedia Contribute For
Dummies, by Janine Warner and Frank Vera (published by Wiley Publishing,
Inc.), which has many details that we can’t fit into this minibook.
Inserting a Document as FlashPaper
Contribute 2 owners with Windows 2000 or Windows XP operating systems
have access to a special utility: the FlashPaper Printer. No, it doesn’t print
Flash movies. What it does is convert your Office documents (Word files,

Book VII
Chapter 2
Basics for
Contributors
Adding Images, Links, and More
769
Excel spreadsheets, even PowerPoint presentations) into compact .swf files
(Flash movies) that can be displayed on your Web page and viewed by any-
one with the Flash plug-in in their browser (which is almost everyone!).
To insert an Office document into your draft as a Flash movie, just follow
these steps:
1. Place your cursor in the draft and click where you want to add the
document.
The cursor blinks where the top left of your image will appear on the
page. You can insert an image in a table cell or anywhere else on the
page.
2. Choose Insert➪Document as FlashPaper.
The Open dialog box appears.
3. Navigate to the folder the document is in, and then either double-
click the document’s file name, or click the filename once and click
Open.
The FlashPaper Options dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 2-13.
4. Choose either Portrait (vertical) or Landscape (horizontal) for the
Page orientation, and then either select a standard printed document
size from the Standard drop-down list or select the Custom radio
button and enter a custom size (width, height, and, from the drop-
down list, either inches or millimeters).
The Converting to FlashPaper dialog box appears while the conversion
takes place. Then the Flash SWF movie is placed in your draft. When
you publish the page, Contribute automatically uploads the .swf file.
You can also use the standalone FlashPaper Printer outside of Contribute if
you want. See the Help files in Contribute for details.
Figure 2-13:

Previewing Your Work
770
You can’t edit a FlashPaper movie. If you want to change a FlashPaper
movie, you must go back and change the document it was made from and
convert the updated document.
Previewing Your Work
If you make minor text changes to a page, you may not need to see it in a
browser like Internet Explorer or Opera before you put it on your Web site
for the whole world to see. But if you make extensive changes, or if you’ve
created a new page, you may wish to check out how it looks in your regular
Web browser before you publish it to your site.
To preview a draft in your regular Web browser, select File➪Preview or use
the keyboard shortcut F12. Your regular Web browser (such as Internet
Explorer) opens and displays the page you’re editing.
Uploading (Publishing) a Page
When you’ve finished editing a page or creating a new one, you’ll want to
put it on your Web site where people can browse to it — that is, if you don’t
want to preview the page (see the preceding section, “Previewing Your Work”)
and you don’t need approval to post the page (see “Collaborating,” the next
section in this chapter). In Contribute, uploading the page to your Web
server, where it can be seen by any visitor who goes to the right URL, is
known as publishing a draft.
Publishing a draft is incredibly simple: Just click the Publish button at the
top left of Contribute’s Browser. The page and any images or Flash movies
you’ve added to it are uploaded to the server, and Contribute’s Browser
automatically switches to Browse mode to display the uploaded page as it
will appear to visitors to your site.
Collaborating
Contribute has several features that make collaborating on a site easy. For
example, when you edit a page, Contribute prevents anyone else from edit-
ing the page at the same time. That way, you’ll never accidentally overwrite
someone else’s changes — and they’ll never overwrite yours!
Contribute also has a special feature that comes in very handy if someone
else needs to check your work before you publish it to your site: E-mail
Review.

Book VII
Chapter 2

771
To make a preview of your draft and send an e-mail to a colleague with a link
to the preview, just follow these steps:
1. While you’re in Edit mode on the page you want to show to your col-
league, select File➪E-mail Review.
An informational Contribute window appears, unless you selected
the “Don’t show this window again” check box earlier. If the window
appears, click OK. Then an e-mail opens with a link to the page and a
brief request for review.
2. Edit the e-mail if necessary and send it.
3. If you think you may have to wait awhile for approval, save the draft
by clicking the Save for Later button at the top of the Browser.
The draft will appear in the Pages panel.
4. When you have approval, click the draft’s name in the Pages panel.
The Browser switches to Edit mode and loads the draft in the Browser.
5. Click Publish.
The Browser switches to Browse mode and displays the published page
as it appears on your Web site.

I
f you’re set up to be a Contribute 2 site administrator, you can do every-
thing a regular user can do — edit existing pages and make new ones —
but you can also control who the regular users are, what access they have
to a site, and more.
A site may have multiple administrators as well as multiple users. All admin-
istrators have the same privileges, including the privilege to set up groups
of users with distinct privileges. If reading that last sentence makes you feel
like you’ve just stumbled into a hall of mirrors, don’t worry. Read on, and
you’ll be a site administrator in no time.
Setting Yourself Up as Site Administrator
You can set yourself up as an administrator, or you can set someone else up
as an administrator. But first things first: If you want to make site adminis-
trators of your colleagues, you have to make yourself a site administrator
first. By the way, if you want to be an administrator on a site that already
has one, you’ll need that site’s administrator to set you up with administra-
tor privileges.
Though you may be able to set yourself up as site administrator at any time
by editing your settings, we assume for the purposes of this book that you
are setting yourself up as an administrator at the same time you are making
your first connection to the site in Contribute, and that nobody else has yet
done so. To set yourself up as an administrator, just follow these steps:

Setting Yourself Up as Site Administrator
774
1. Browse to the site to which you want to connect via Contribute’s
Browser by typing or pasting a URL (for example, http://www.
mysite.com) into the Address text field and pressing Enter or
clicking the Go button.
You can use Contribute’s Browser to view any site on the Web, but you
can only set up a connection to a site if you have FTP information for
that site.
2. Click the Create Connection button at the top left of the Browser, as
shown in Figure 3-1.
The Connection Wizard opens to its Welcome screen.
3. We’re assuming you don’t have a connection key, so click the Next
button at the bottom of the wizard.
The User Information screen appears. For more information about con-
nection keys, see the “Creating Connection Keys to Provide Access to
Contributors” section, later in this chapter.
4. Enter your name in the What Is Your Name? text field.
Your name may already appear. The name in this field will identify you
to other contributors to your site, if there are any.
5. If it’s not already there, enter your e-mail address in the What Is Your
E-mail Address? text field and click Next.
The Website Home Page screen appears.

6. If necessary, enter the URL (http://www.mysite.com, for example)
for the Web site you’ll be editing by typing it or pasting it into the
text field. Click Next.
The URL should be there already, because you browsed to the site to
start the connection process. When you click Next, the Connection
Information screen appears in the wizard.
7. Select a connection method from the drop-down list.
You have the following options: FTP, Secure FTP (SFTP), and Local/
Network. Depending on what you choose, different text fields appear
below the drop-down list. As you can see in Figure 3-2, we entered SFTP.
8a. If you selected FTP or SFTP, enter the FTP server name (such as
sftp.earlsbowlateria.com), the ftp login (sometimes called the
username), and the ftp password in the respective text fields. Click
Next.
When you click Next, the Administrator Information screen appears
(go to Step 9).
8b. If you selected Local/Network, enter the network path (for example,
\\mynetwork\mydepartment\site) by typing or pasting it in, or by
clicking the Choose Folder button and browsing in your network to
the folder that contains your site. Click Next.
When you click Next, the Administrator Information screen appears.
9. Select the Yes, I Want to Be the Administrator option.
Two password text fields appear on the screen.

10. Enter a password in the top text field on the Administrator
Information screen. Then re-enter the password in the text field
below, exactly as you typed it above. Click Next.
You can use any combination of numbers and letters for your password.
The password is case-sensitive (so as far as the password is concerned,
a big “S” and a small “s” are different characters). Only contributors
who know that password will be able to perform administrator func-
tions on the site. When you click Next, the Summary screen appears.
11. Make sure the information is correct. If it isn’t, use the Back button to
go to the screen with incorrect info and fix the mistake; then use the
Next button to return to the Summary screen. Click Done.
Your connection is set. When you click Done, a dialog box pops up that
says, “Would you like to change the Contribute administration settings
for this Web site? To change these settings later, select Edit➪Administer
Websites.” You can click Yes and go to Step 2 in the following section,
“Changing Settings in the Connection Wizard,” or you can click No and
proceed to follow the instructions in that section from Step 1.
Changing Settings in the Connection Wizard
If you didn’t set yourself up as an administrator when you made your origi-
nal connection to a site, you can make yourself an administrator later by
changing some settings in the Connection Wizard. To do so, just follow
these steps:
1. Choose Edit➪My Connections.
The My Connections dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 3-3.
2. Double-click the line that shows the name of the site you want to
administer.
The Connection Wizard appears.
3. Click the Next button a few times until you see the Administrator
Information screen.
4. Select the Yes, I Want to Be an Administrator option.
Text fields for a password appear.
5. Enter a password in the top text field. Then re-enter the password in
the text field below, exactly as you typed it above. Click Next.
You can use any combination of numbers and letters for your password.
Again, the password is case-sensitive. Only contributors who know that
password will be able to perform administrator functions on the site.
When you click Next, the Summary screen appears.

Your connection is set. When you click Done, a dialog box pops up that
says, “Would you like to change the Contribute administration settings
for this Web site? To change these settings later, select Edit➪Administer
Websites.”
Creating Sitewide Settings
Sitewide settings apply to all contributors to the site, regardless of any group
settings you may make. Using the Sitewide Settings dialog box, shown in
Figure 3-4, you can
✦Change the administrator’s e-mail address
✦Change the administrator’s password
✦Enable rollbacks and customize rollback settings
✦Set up index and URL mapping
✦Delete all permissions and settings at once
We discuss each of those settings in the following subsections.
Changing the administrator’s e-mail address
To change the administrator’s e-mail address, just follow these steps:
1. Choose Edit➪Administer Websites➪Name of Site, where Name of Site
is the name of the site you want to administer.
The Administrator Password dialog box appears.

2. Enter your password and click OK or press Enter.
The Administer Website dialog box appears.
3. Click the Sitewide Settings button in the Sitewide Settings section at
the top of the Administer Website dialog box.
The Sitewide Settings dialog box appears.
4. The existing administrator e-mail address should be highlighted. If it
isn’t, select it by clicking and dragging until the address is high-
lighted.
5. Enter a new address by pasting or typing it into the Administrator
Contact E-mail text field.
6. Click OK.
The Sitewide Settings dialog box disappears, and the new e-mail address
is set.
Changing the Administrator password
To change the Administrator password, follow Steps 1 through 3 in the pre-
vious section, and then do the following:
1. Click the Change Password button.
The Change Password dialog box appears.
2. In the first (top) field, enter your current Administrator password.
Press the Tab key or click in the second field and enter the new pass-
word you would like to use. Press the Tab key or click in the third
field and re-enter the new password exactly as you entered it in the
second field.

Website dialog box and save your changes.
Using the Rollback feature to save file backups
Contribute’s Rollback feature allows contributors to “roll back” to a previ-
ously published version of a page — sometimes reverting back to a prior
state of things is the best way out of a jam. In order to make it possible to
roll back, Contribute keeps backup copies of edited pages on the Web
server. Administrators can specify how many versions Contribute backs
up. Administrators can also disable the Rollback feature.
The main advantage to the rollback feature is pretty obvious: Backups can
help you recover quickly if a newly published version of a page has multiple
errors. Rather than having to scramble to fix the errors while the faulty page
is up on your site for the world to see, you can just roll back almost instan-
taneously to the previously published version of the page.
The major disadvantage of the rollback feature, particularly for large sites, is
that backups take up space on the Web server. If you have Contribute set to
save three versions of each page, by the time your colleagues have published
changes to a hundred pages three times each, three hundred backup pages
have been created and stored in the _baks directory Contribute has placed
on the Web server that contains your site.
To activate and customize the Rollback feature for a site, just follow these
steps:
1. Choose Edit➪Administer Websites➪Name of Site where Name of Site
is the name of the site you want to administer.
The Administrator Password dialog box appears.
2. Enter your password and click OK or press Enter.
The Administer Website dialog box appears.
3. Click the Sitewide Settings button in the Sitewide Settings section at
the top of the Administer Website dialog box.
The Sitewide Settings dialog box appears.
4. Click the Enable Rollbacks check box.
A check appears in the check box, and the text field below is no longer
grayed out.

Creating Sitewide Settings
780
5. Use the toggle buttons at the right of the text field to increase the
number of backups from 0, or double-click the 0 and enter a whole
number between 1 and 99.
Though you may elect to keep up to 99 versions of each page, you’re
probably better off limiting the number to 2 or 3 to conserve space on
your Web server.
6. Click OK to close the Sitewide Settings dialog box, or make any other
changes you wish to make to Sitewide Settings, and click OK in the
Administer Website dialog box.
To disable rollbacks, follow Steps 1 through 4 above, and then skip to Step 6.
Disabling rollbacks will not remove existing backups. To remove existing
backups, disable rollbacks, and then use Dreamweaver or your favorite FTP
client to delete the files. Do not delete the _baks folder.
Setting up index and URL mapping
In some cases, the way your Web server is configured to retrieve index
pages may require you to adjust some settings in Contribute to get your
connections between Contribute and the server working properly. The
Advanced Options section of the Sitewide Settings dialog box includes the
Index and URL Mapping button, which allows you to open a dialog box in
which you can customize index page and URL mapping.
Mapping to index files
If your server is configured to default to home pages in a non-standard way
(if, for example, the server first checks a directory for start.cfm and then
looks for index.htm if it doesn’t find start.cfm), you can set up
Contribute to mirror that configuration.
Contribute has 30 possible index page file names listed (index and default,
for each of 15 extensions). If your server is configured to look for a page
with a different filename (such as start.cfm or main.html), you need to
add that filename to the list.
To add a filename to the list, just follow these steps:
1. Choose Edit➪Administer Websites➪Name of Site, where Name of Site
is the name of the site you want to administer.
The Administrator Password dialog box appears.
2. Enter your password and click OK or press Enter.
The Administer Website dialog box appears.

name appears at the bottom of the list in the Index and URL Mapping
dialog box.
8. Use the arrow buttons at the right to move the new filename to the
spot in the list that reflects the order the server uses.
For example, if the server checks index.cfm first, that filename should
be at the top of the list (as it appears in Figure 3-5). Each time you click
the up-arrow button, the selected name moves up one spot in the list.
9. Make any other changes to the Index and URL Mapping settings, if
necessary, and click OK. Then click OK in the Administer Website

Mapping to alternate Web site addresses
If you have multiple DNS entries pointing toward a single IP address (if
http://www.earlsbowlateria.com and http://www.earls-bowlateria.
com, for example, both point to the same Web server), or if your contribu-
tors will be accessing your Web server using different addresses (from the
Web and from your internal network, for example), you need to set up
Contribute to recognize the additional addresses. Luckily, doing so is
simple.
To map Contribute to an alternate Web site address, just follow these steps:
1. Choose Edit➪Administer Websites➪Name of Site, where Name of Site
is the name of the site you want to administer.
The Administrator Password dialog box appears.
2. Enter your password and click OK or press Enter.
The Administer Website dialog box appears.

Deleting all permissions and settings at once
The Sitewide Settings dialog box includes a button that allows you to delete
all your custom sitewide settings and permission groups with a single click.
You might find it efficient to delete all the settings at once if your company
or your Web site has just gone through a massive reorganization.
If you click this button, then you nullify all restrictions you may have placed
on any of your contributors. This means that all contributors will have stan-
dard user access to all files on your site. It also means if you have an elabo-
rate array of restrictions and permission groups and you change your mind
the next day, you’ll have to recreate all those settings from scratch.

Setting Up Groups
784
To delete all your sitewide settings and permission groups, simply click
the Remove Administration button in the Advanced Options section of the
Sitewide Settings dialog box. A Warning dialog box appears to give you a
chance to back out. If you’re sure you want to delete the settings, click Yes.
Then click OK in the Sitewide Settings dialog box and click OK in the
Administer Website dialog box.
Setting Up Groups
After you have designated yourself an administrator, you have access to the
Administer Website dialog box, in which you can do things like configure
sitewide settings, send connection keys, and more.
When you set up a connection, Contribute automatically creates two default
groups of contributors: Administrators and Users. You can set up as many
additional groups as you like; each group might have different new page cre-
ation permissions or access to different directories on the site, or other dif-
ferent settings and permissions.
Opening the Administer Website dialog box
To open the Administer Website dialog box for a site to which you have
administrator access, simply do the following:
1. Choose Edit➪Administer Websites➪Name of Site, where Name of Site
is the name of the site you want to administer.
The Administrator Password dialog box appears.
2. Enter your password and click OK or press Enter.
The Administer Website dialog box appears.
Setting up a new group
If you don’t need more than one group of users and one group of administra-
tors, you can skip this section. If you want to create a new group, you can do
it one of two ways:
✦By creating a new group from scratch
✦By duplicating an existing group and modifying the duplicated group’s
settings
To create a new group from scratch, just follow these steps:

Deleting groups
Deleting a group is easy. Simply follow these steps:
1. Open the Administer Website dialog box by following the steps
described in the earlier section, “Opening the Administer Website
dialog box.”
2. In the Permission Groups section of the Administer Website dialog
box, click the name of the group you want to delete.
The group name highlights.
3. Click the Delete button.
A dialog box pops up, warning you that you are about to delete a group.
4. Click Yes to delete the group.
The Warning dialog box closes and the group’s name disappears from
the Administer Website dialog box.
Granting Group Permissions
After you’ve created a group (or decided to go with the default groups,
Administrators and Users), you can adjust the permissions granted to the
group. Permissions may be wholesale (contributors in the Users group may
upload any images) or conditional (Users may upload images, but only if the
image’s file sizes are smaller than 32 kilobytes, for example).
Unlike sitewide settings, group permissions apply only to individual groups,
not to all groups. Each group may have its own permissions or settings in
the following areas:
✦General
✦Folder/File Access
✦Editing
✦Styles and Fonts

✦New Pages

We discuss each of the areas in detail in the following subsections.
Making general settings
When you open the Permission Group dialog box, you see the General screen
by default. The General options allow you to make two settings for a group:
✦Group Description: A sentence or two that describes the group. The
Group Description is what people will see when they click the group
name in the Connection Wizard.
✦Group Home Page: The page that will load when members of the group
connect to the Web site in Contribute.
To create a group description, follow these simple steps:
1. Choose Edit➪Administer Websites➪Name of Site, where Name of Site
is the name of the site you want to administer.
The Administrator Password dialog box appears.
2. Enter your password and click OK or press Enter.
The Administer Website dialog box appears.
3. In the Permission Groups section of the Administer Website dialog
box, click the name of the group whose settings you want to edit and
click the Edit button on the right, or double-click the group name.
The Permission Group dialog box appears, opened to the General
screen, with the text in the Group Description field highlighted, as
shown in Figure 3-7.
4. Enter a group description by typing or pasting it into the Group
Description text field.
5. Click OK to save your changes and close the dialog box, or make other
changes to the group’s permissions as needed before you click OK.
If your Web site has several directories, each of which is maintained by a 
different department, you can make a group for each department and set a
default home page for each group. For example, members of the Communi-
cations Department, who are responsible only for updating press releases,
might have http://www.mycompany.com/news/index.htm as their home
page.

Granting Group Permissions
788
To specify a special home page for a group, follow these steps:
1. Open the Permission Group dialog box by following Steps 1 through
3 in the previous list.
The Group Home Page field includes the name of the site’s default home
page.
2. Click and drag to select the current group home page and enter a
new URL by typing or pasting the URL into the Group Home Page text
field. Alternatively, you can click the Choose button at the right and
navigate to the page in the Choose File on Website dialog box.
One advantage of navigating via the Choose File on Website dialog box
is that you avoid the possibility of misspelling the URL.
3. Click OK to save your changes and close the dialog box, or make other
changes to the group’s permissions as needed before clicking OK.
Figure 3-8 shows a detail of the General screen with customized description
and home page for a group called “Communications Dept.” The description
is not fully visible in Figure 3-8; the full text reads, “This group has access
to the News directory only, and may create new pages only from the News
template.”
Granting access to folders and files
You may wish to restrict certain groups of contributors from editing particu-
lar files on your site. For example, you may want the members of your

Communications Department to be able to update the News section of your
site but not have access to the Products section. Contribute allows you to
specify which folders (directories) a group may access to edit the files
within.
To grant a group access to the files in a particular folder that already exists
on your site, just follow these steps:
1. If you have the Permissions Group dialog box open already, skip to
Step 5. Otherwise, continue with Step 2.
2. Choose Edit➪Administer Websites➪Name of Site, where Name of Site
is the name of the site you want to administer.

The Choose Folder dialog box disappears, and the URL for the folder
you selected appears in the Folder access text field, highlighted.
9. Click OK to save your changes and close the dialog box, or make other
changes to the group’s permissions as needed before clicking OK.
Extending file deletion privileges
The Folder/File Access screen in the Permission Group dialog box also allows
you to choose whether or not a group will be permitted to delete files from
the site. Members of the group may only delete files that they have permis-
sion to edit.
To allow users to delete files from a site, follow these simple steps:
1. If the Folder/File Access screen in the Permission Group dialog box
is not already showing, open it by following Steps 2 through 5 in the
previous list. Otherwise, skip to Step 2.
2. Select the Allow Users to Delete Files They Have Permission to Edit
check box at the top of the File Deletion section of the dialog box.

Customizing editing settings
The Editing options in the Permission Group dialog box, shown in Figure 3-10,
allow you to set what aspects of a page’s underlying HTML code can be edited
by a group member. It also allows you to specify how Contribute will write
some basic HTML formatting code.
Setting non-template page editing options
Dreamweaver templates “lock” certain chunks of code so that people editing
pages based on those templates cannot change certain aspects of the way
the page is built to preserve the structure and look of the page. (For details
on creating Dreamweaver templates, see Book II, Chapter 7).
If you’re not using Dreamweaver templates but you still want to protect any
specialized code (ColdFusion markup, for example) from being edited, select
the Protect Scripts and Forms check box in the Non-Template Pages section.
(The Allow Unrestricted Editing option is selected by default; if you want to
allow everything on the page to be edited except scripts and forms, the
Allow Unrestricted Editing option must be selected before the Protect Scripts
and Forms check box can be selected).

If you want members of a group to be able to edit and format text only,
select the Only Allow Text Editing and Formatting option.
Setting the Paragraph Spacing option
When you’re writing text in a regular word processing program (such as
Microsoft Word) and you press the Enter key on your keyboard, your
cursor goes to the next line, just as a carriage return works on a typewriter.
When you press Enter to go to a new line in a WYSIWYG HTML editor like
Dreamweaver, a blank line is inserted between the previous line you were on
and the new line. You can set up Contribute to function either like a word
processor or like Dreamweaver when a contributor presses the Enter key.
It’s not just Contribute’s behavior that changes when you change this set-
ting, it’s also the underlying HTML code Contribute generates. When you
select the One Line option in the Paragraph Spacing section, Contribute gen-
erates an inline CSS style to create the line break. When you select the Two
Lines option, Contribute uses the standard HTML paragraph tag <P> to
create the line break.
To set up Contribute to start a new line of text directly under the old one
when a contributor presses the Enter key, select the One Line, As in Standard
Word Processors (Uses Inline CSS Styles) option.
To set Contribute to start a new line of text two lines down from the old line,
leaving a space in between, select the Two Lines, As in Web Page Editors
(Uses Standard <P> Tags) option.
Setting other editing options
In the Other Editing Options section of the Editing screen, the Allow Multiple
Consecutive Spaces (Uses &nbsp;) option is selected by default. Deselect
this option only if you want to prevent contributors from creating vertical
space in a page by inserting multiple spaces.
Select the Enforce Accessibility Options (Such As ALT Text for Images)
option if you want Contribute to prompt contributors to include information
that makes the page more accessible to visitors to your site who might have
disabilities.
Leave the Use <STRONG> and <EM> in Place of <B> and <I> option selected if
you want Contribute to use the latest HTML tags for bold and italic format-
ted text.

To choose a line break type for the underlying code (not the text as it appears
in a browser), select one from the Line Break Type drop-down list. In most
cases, you may leave this at its default setting; if the people working directly
on the HTML use a particular type of computer, you may wish to select the
line break type accordingly. “CR” stands for “Carriage Return,” and “LF” is
short for “Line Feed.” Contribute offers the following line break types:
✦Windows (CR LF)
✦Mac (CR)
✦Unix (LF)
Granting styles and fonts permissions
To change the permissions for a group’s ability to format text on Web pages,
click Styles and Fonts in the list on the left side of the Permission Group
dialog box (see Figure 3-11). Formatting text is usually one of the main
responsibilities of anybody maintaining a Web site. Contribute makes for-
matting text easy as it is; setting styles and fonts permissions can make for-
matting text even easier for contributors by taking away options that might
lead to incorrect formatting.
Setting styles options
By default, contributors are permitted to apply CSS styles and HTML para-
graph and heading styles to text on pages they have permission to edit. By
Figure 3-11:

deselecting the Allow Users to Apply Styles (Displays the Style Menu on the
Toolbar) check box, you can prevent users from being able to apply HTML
and CSS styles by removing the Style menu from the Contribute Browser’s
toolbar. If you deselect that check box, the other two boxes in the Styles
section become grayed out, because if there’s no Styles menu on the tool-
bar, there’s no way to apply HTML or CSS styles.
If you don’t want contributors to be able to apply CSS styles but you do
want them to be able to apply styles to <P> tags and to insert header tags
(<H1>, <H2>, and so on), deselect the Include CSS Styles in the Style Menu
check box, but leave the other two check boxes selected.
If, on the other hand, you have set up a thorough CSS style sheet and don’t
want contributors using generic HTML paragraph and heading styles to
format text, deselect the Include HTML Paragraph and Heading Styles (<P>,
<H1>, . . .) in the Style Menu check box, but leave the other two check boxes
selected.
Setting fonts options
When the Allow Users to Apply Fonts and Sizes (Displays the Font and Size
Menus on the Toolbar) check box is selected, as it is by default, contribu-
tors can format text by choosing a font face and font size from drop-down
lists on the Contribute Browser’s toolbar.
If you’re using a CSS style sheet that includes font face, size, color, and other
attributes for all text on your site, deselect the Allow Users to Apply Fonts
and Sizes check box and make sure the Include CSS Styles in the Style Menu
check box is selected above.
If you want to allow contributors to apply text formatting, and you want
Contribute to generate basic HTML <FONT> tags, just follow these steps
(assuming you have the Styles and Fonts options of the Permission Group
dialog box showing):
1. Select the Allow Users to Apply Fonts and Sizes check box, if it isn’t
already selected.
This box is selected by default.
2. Select the HTML Tags option under the Apply Fonts Using heading.
3. Click OK to save your changes and close the dialog box, or make other
changes to the group’s permissions as needed before clicking OK.
If you want to allow contributors to apply text formatting, but you want
Contribute to generate CSS style code instead of HTML <FONT> tags, just

4. Click OK to save your changes and close the dialog box, or make other
changes to the group’s permissions as needed before clicking OK.
Granting permission to create new pages
Chances are, your contributors are going to need to create new pages for
your Web site. If your company paid good money to have the site profes-
sionally designed, however, you probably don’t want the people maintaining
your site to fashion pages that diverge from the approved design.
Contribute gives Administrators a way to force contributors to use
Dreamweaver templates (the safest bet) or to use existing pages to create
new ones. That helps keep the site design uniform and saves time for the
people maintaining the site, as well.
To control the types of Web pages contributors can create, just follow these
steps:
1. If you don’t already have the Permission Group dialog box open,
choose Edit➪Administer Websites➪Name of Site, where Name of Site
is the name of the site you want to administer.
The Administrator Password dialog box appears.
2. Enter your password and click OK or press Enter.

Creating Connection Keys to Provide 
Access to Contributors
Connection keys are password-protected, encrypted text files that contain
the data Contribute needs to establish a connection with a Web site. When
you send a connection key to a group member, all the member needs to do to
establish a connection is double-click the key (and enter a password). That
can be pretty handy if you have several people in a group, since you can
e-mail the same key to all of them, or post the key on your internal network.
You don’t have to go to each member’s machine to set up the connection,
nor do you have to worry about providing tech support if you’ve decided to
let people establish their own connections. Best of all, connection keys are
specific to groups, so you don’t have to worry that a contributor will choose
to be in the wrong group.
To create a connection key, follow these steps:
1. Choose Edit➪Administer Websites➪Name of Site, where Name of Site
is the name of the site you want to administer.

2. Enter your password and click OK or press Enter.

the box will be grayed out). Click Next and skip to Step 6.
When you click Next, the Group Information screen appears.
4c. If group members will be connecting to the site in a different way
than you do, select the No, I Would Like to Customize the Connection
Settings for Other Users option. Then click Next and go to Step 5.
If group members will be connecting via the Web while you connect via
your network, you’ll need to customize the connection settings for the
group members. When you click Next, the Connection Information
screen appears.
5. Enter the information to set up a connection and click Next.
For information about the Connection Information screen, see the sec-
tion on connecting to a site with the Connection Wizard in Book VII,

6. In the Select a Group area, click the name of the group of users who
will use the connection key you’re creating. Click Next.
When you click the group name, the group’s description appears at the
right, as shown in Figure 3-15. When you click Next, the Connection Key
Information screen appears.
7. To answer the question, How Would You Like to Export the Connection
Key File? select either the Send in E-mail or the Save to Local Machine
option.
Macromedia recommends you not send the key via Web-based e-mail
(like Hotmail or Yahoo!) because, even though the key is encrypted, it
contains sensitive information that should never be sent via inherently
less secure Web-based e-mail.
8. In the top text field, enter a password that will enable group members
to use the key. Press the Tab key or click in the bottom text field.
A contributor must have the password in order to use the key. The 
password may contain spaces, numbers, and letters and be up to thirty
characters long; the password is case-sensitive. If you send the key in an
e-mail, it’s safest not to include the password in the same e-mail. Instead,
send the password in a separate e-mail or, better yet, reveal the pass-
word verbally to group members.
9. Re-enter the password exactly as you entered it in the above text field
and click Next.
The Summary screen appears, as shown in Figure 3-16.

10. Carefully check the information on the Summary screen to make
sure it is correct. If it isn’t, use the Back button to go back and correct
any information on previous screens and click Next to return to the
Summary screen. If the information is correct, click Done.
If you selected the Send in E-mail option, a new e-mail with the connec-
tion key attached will open automatically in your e-mail program.
Customize the e-mail as necessary, add a recipient or recipients, and
send the message. If you selected the Save to Local Machine option, the
Export Connection Key dialog box opens. Navigate to the folder on the
local machine or on your network where you want to place the key and
click Save.

 Introducing FlashPaper
 Teaming Contribute 2 with Dreamweaver
 Using the PayPal extension 
C
ontribute 2 isn’t really integrated into the Macromedia Studio MX 2004
suite. It’s very much a standalone product created for people who need
to maintain Web sites but not build them. Contribute 2 for Windows comes
with its own standalone product: FlashPaper.
Introducing FlashPaper
FlashPaper converts any printable file (word processing document, spread-
sheet, slide show) into an SWF file that can be viewed by anyone with the
latest version of the standalone Macromedia Flash Player or a browser with
the latest version of the Flash plug-in.
Unless you specified otherwise, when you installed Contribute, you installed
FlashPaper also, and the FlashPaper icon was placed automatically on your
desktop, as shown in Figure 4-1.
FlashPaper can be accessed from within Contribute (see the section on
adding images, links, and more in Book VII, Chapter 2 for details). That
means when you insert a document as FlashPaper into a draft, you might
not even realize you’re using another application. But FlashPaper can run
quite independently of Contribute.
Figure 4-1:
The
FlashPaper
icon.

Introducing FlashPaper
804
You can use FlashPaper as a standalone application to in two ways:
✦By dragging a printable document onto the FlashPaper desktop icon.
✦By selecting the FlashPaper printer when you print from within an appli-
cation like Word or Excel. Figure 4-2 shows FlashPaper selected in two
different applications; the Print dialog box on the top is from Word and
the Print dialog box on the bottom is from Internet Explorer.
Whichever method you choose, your printable document is cloned as an
SWF file.
Figure 4-2:

applications,
including

and IE

Understanding Dreamweaver Templates
805
While you could theoretically “print” an image as an SWF, there’s no com-
pelling reason to do so, because image formats like GIF and JPEG are nearly
universally compatible with image display and editing programs as well as
browsers.
There is one catch: SWF files generated by FlashPaper cannot be edited with
Macromedia Flash MX 2004. If you need to change a file you’ve converted
with FlashPaper, you have to change the original file, and then make a new
FlashPaper document from it.
As of this writing, FlashPaper is available only for Windows versions
after Windows 95; presumably Macromedia is at work on a Mac version.
(Contribute was originally available only for Windows, but with version 2,
it is now available for Mac users.)
Teaming Contribute with Dreamweaver
For Web developers who plan to hand off the maintenance of the sites
they’ve built to people who don’t know anything about HTML, FTP, or CSS,
Contribute represents a certain amount of peace of mind. Especially when
combined with Dreamweaver templates, Contribute can make creating new
pages with a consistent design faster and simpler for nontechnical people
doing site maintenance.
Understanding Dreamweaver Templates
A Dreamweaver template is a special type of file (it uses the extension .dwt)
that may contain HTML, CFML, and other typical Web page code, and that
also contains hidden instructions that tell Dreamweaver and Contribute to
“lock” certain portions of the code — basically making those chunks of code
unavailable for editing.
Figure 4-3 shows a new page based on a simple Dreamweaver template. The
template has three editable areas: the top navigation, the page header, and
the main text area. When the cursor is over any other area on the draft, it
becomes a circle-slash, signifying that edits to the area are not permitted.
The page title, which you can see highlighted in the Pages panel as well as
prominently displayed in the Contribute title bar in Figure 4-3, has been
entered in the New Page dialog box that appears when a contributor creates
a new page. (See Book VII, Chapter 2 for details on creating a new page
based on a Dreamweaver template.)

Working with PayPal
806
For details about creating Dreamweaver templates, see Book II, Chapter 7.
For details about how to ensure that contributors use particular templates
to create new pages on your site, see the section on granting group permis-
sions in Book VII, Chapter 3.
Working with PayPal
Contribute 2 includes an extension similar to the one available for
Dreamweaver that makes adding PayPal buttons to your page a snap.
(Note: You must have a PayPal Business or Premier account to insert the
PayPal buttons into your page, and your site must already have the code
for the shopping cart.) In order to use the extension, you have to select it
when you install Contribute, as shown in Figure 4-4.
If you have the PayPal extension installed, you see an extra button at the
right side of the browser toolbar when you’re editing a page. When you click
and hold that button, you can select the following options from the pop-up
menu:
✦Buy Now Button
✦Add to Cart Button
✦View Cart Button
✦Subscription Button

Those same options are also available when you choose Insert➪PayPal.
A wizard guides you through the steps necessary to insert the buttons on
your page — be sure to have your PayPal account information at hand.
Make sure that any contributor working on a page with PayPal buttons
has the PayPal extension installed. Also, be aware that Contribute’s PayPal
extension may have trouble with forms that use JavaScript validation, forms
within <SPAN> tags in Dreamweaver templates, and more. See the Contribute
TechNote at www.macromedia.com/support/contribute/ts/documents/
paypal.htm for details on workarounds.
