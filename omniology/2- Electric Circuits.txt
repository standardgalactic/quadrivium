The first edition of Electric Circuits, an introductory circuits text, was pub-
lished in 1983. It included 100 worked examples and about 600 problems. It
did not include a student workbook, supplements for PSpice or MultiSim,
or any web support. Support for instructors was limited to a solution man-
ual for the problems and enlarged copies of many text figures, suitable for
making transparencies.
Much has changed in the 31 years since Electric Circuits first appeared,
and during that time this text has evolved to better meet the needs of both
students and their instructors. As an example, the text now includes about
150 worked examples, about 1850 problems, and extensive supplements
and web content. The tenth edition is designed to revise and improve the
material presented in the text, in its supplements, and on the web. Yet the
fundamental goals of the text are unchanged.These goals are:
•
To build an understanding of concepts and ideas explicitly in terms of
previous learning. Students are constantly challenged by the need to
layer new concepts on top of previous concepts they may still be
struggling to master.This text provides an important focus on helping
students understand how new concepts are related to and rely upon
concepts previously presented.
•
To emphasize the relationship between conceptual understanding
and problem-solving approaches. Developing problem-solving skills
continues to be the central challenge in a first-year circuits course. In
this text we include numerous Examples that present problem-
solving techniques followed by Assessment Problems that enable
students to test their mastery of the material and techniques intro-
duced. The problem-solving process we illustrate is based on con-
cepts rather than the use of rote procedures. This encourages
students to think about a problem before attempting to solve it.
•
To provide students with a strong foundation of engineering prac-
tices. There are limited opportunities in a first-year circuit analysis
course to introduce students to realistic engineering experiences. We
continue to take advantage of the opportunities that do exist by
including problems and examples that use realistic component values
and represent realizable circuits. We include many problems related
to the Practical Perspective problems that begin each chapter. We
also include problems intended to stimulate the students’ interest in
engineering, where the problems require the type of insight typical of
a practicing engineer.
WHY THIS EDITION?
The tenth edition revision of Electric Circuits began with a thorough
review of the text. This review provided a clear picture of what matters
most to instructors and their students and led to the following changes:
•
Problem solving is fundamental to the study of circuit analysis.
Having a wealth of new problems to assign and work is a key to suc-
cess in any circuits course. Therefore, existing end-of-chapter prob-
lems were revised, and new end-of-chapter problems were added.As
a result, more than 40% of the problems in the tenth edition have
never appeared in any previous edition of the text.

•
Both students and instructors want to know how the generalized
techniques presented in a first-year circuit analysis course relate to
problems faced by practicing engineers. The Practical Perspective
problems provide this connection between circuit analysis and the
real world. We have created new Practical Perspective problems for
Chapters 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, and 10. Many of the new problems represent the
world of the 21st century. Each Practical Perspective problem is
solved, at least in part, at the end of the chapter, and additional end-
of-chapter problems can be assigned to allow students to explore the
Practical Perspective topic further.
•
The PSpice and Multisim manuals have been revised to include
screenshots from the most recent versions of these software simula-
tion applications. Each manual presents the simulation material in
the same order as the material is presented in the text. These manu-
als continue to include examples of circuits to be simulated that are
drawn directly from the text. The text continues to indicate end-of-
chapter problems that are good candidates for simulation using
either PSpice or Multisim.
• Students who could benefit from additional examples and practice
problems can use the Student Workbook, which has been revised to
reflect changes to the tenth edition of the text. This workbook has
examples and problems covering the following material: balancing
power, simple resistive circuits, node voltage method, mesh current
method, Thévenin and Norton equivalents, op amp circuits, first-
order circuits, second-order circuits, AC steady-state analysis, and
Laplace transform circuit analysis.
• The Student Workbook now includes access to Video Solutions,
complete, step-by-step solution walkthroughs to representative
homework problems.
• Learning Catalytics, a “bring your own device” student engagement,
assessment, and classroom intelligence system is now available with
the tenth edition.With Learning Catalytics you can:
• Use open-ended questions to get into the minds of students to
understand what they do or don’t know and adjust lectures
accordingly.
• Use a wide variety of question types to sketch a graph, annotate a
circuit diagram, compose numeric or algebraic answers, and more.
• Access rich analytics to understand student performance.
• Use pre-built questions or add your own to make Learning
Catalytics fit your course exactly.
• MasteringEngineering is an online tutorial and assessment program
that provides students with personalized feedback and hints and
instructors with diagnostics to track students’ progress.With the tenth
edition,MasteringEngineering will offer new tutorial homework prob-
lems, Coaching Activities, and Adaptive Follow-Up assignments. Visit

HALLMARK FEATURES
Chapter Problems
Users of Electric Circuits have consistently rated the Chapter Problems
as one of the book’s most attractive features. In the tenth edition, there
are over 1650 end-of-chapter problems with approximately 40% that
have never appeared in a previous edition. Problems are organized at
the end of each chapter by section.

Preface
xix
Practical Perspectives
The tenth edition continues the use of Practical Perspectives introduced
with the chapter openers.They offer examples of real-world circuits, taken
from real-world devices. The Practical Perspectives for six of the chapters
are brand new to this edition. Every chapter begins with a brief descrip-
tion of a practical application of the material that follows. Once the chap-
ter material is presented, the chapter concludes with a quantitative
analysis of the Practical Perspective application. A group of end-of-chap-
ter problems directly relates to the Practical Perspective application.
Solving some of these problems enables you to understand how to apply
the chapter contents to the solution of a real-world problem.
Assessment Problems
Each chapter begins with a set of chapter objectives. At key points in the
chapter, you are asked to stop and assess your mastery of a particular
objective by solving one or more assessment problems. The answers to all
of the assessment problems are given at the conclusion of each problem, so
you can check your work. If you are able to solve the assessment problems
for a given objective, you have mastered that objective. If you need more
practice, several end-of-chapter problems that relate to the objective are
suggested at the conclusion of the assessment problems.
Examples
Every chapter includes many examples that illustrate the concepts
presented in the text in the form of a numeric example. There are
nearly 150 examples in this text. The examples are intended to illus-
trate the application of a particular concept, and also to encourage
good problem-solving skills.
Fundamental Equations and Concepts
Throughout the text, you will see fundamental equations and concepts
set apart from the main text.This is done to help you focus on some of the
key principles in electric circuits and to help you navigate through the
important topics.
Integration of Computer Tools
Computer tools can assist students in the learning process by providing a
visual representation of a circuit’s behavior, validating a calculated solu-
tion, reducing the computational burden of more complex circuits, and
iterating toward a desired solution using parameter variation.This compu-
tational support is often invaluable in the design process.The tenth edition
includes the support of PSpice® and Multisim®, both popular computer
tools for circuit simulation and analysis. Chapter problems suited for
exploration with PSpice and Multisim are marked accordingly.
Design Emphasis
The tenth edition continues to support the emphasis on the design of cir-
cuits in many ways. First, many of the Practical Perspective discussions
focus on the design aspects of the circuits. The accompanying Chapter
Problems continue the discussion of the design issues in these practical
examples. Second, design-oriented Chapter Problems have been labeled
explicitly, enabling students and instructors to identify those problems
with a design focus. Third, the identification of problems suited to explo-
ration with PSpice or Multisim suggests design opportunities using these

xx
Preface
software tools. Fourth, some problems in nearly every chapter focus on the
use of realistic component values in achieving a desired circuit design.
Once such a problem has been analyzed, the student can proceed to a lab-
oratory to build and test the circuit, comparing the analysis with the meas-
ured performance of the actual circuit.
Accuracy
All text and problems in the tenth edition have undergone our strict 
hallmark accuracy checking process, to ensure the most error-free book
possible.

PREREQUISITES
In writing the first 12 chapters of the text, we have assumed that the
reader has taken a course in elementary differential and integral calculus.
We have also assumed that the reader has had an introductory physics
course, at either the high school or university level, that introduces the
concepts of energy, power, electric charge, electric current, electric poten-
tial, and electromagnetic fields. In writing the final six chapters, we have
assumed the student has had, or is enrolled in, an introductory course in
differential equations.
COURSE OPTIONS
The text has been designed for use in a one-semester, two-semester, or a
three-quarter sequence.
•
Single-semester course: After covering Chapters 1–4 and Chapters 6–10
(omitting Sections 7.7 and 8.5) the instructor can choose from 
Chapter 5 (operational amplifiers), Chapter 11 (three-phase circuits),
Chapters 13 and 14 (Laplace methods), and Chapter 18 (Two-Port
Circuits) to develop the desired emphasis.
•
Two-semester sequence: Assuming three lectures per week, the first
nine chapters can be covered during the first semester, leaving
Chapters 10–18 for the second semester.
•
Academic quarter schedule: The book can be subdivided into three
parts: Chapters 1–6, Chapters 7–12, and Chapters 13–18.
The introduction to operational amplifier circuits in Chapter 5 can be
omitted without interfering with the reading of subsequent chapters. For
example, if Chapter 5 is omitted, the instructor can simply skip Section 7.7,
Section 8.5, Chapter 15, and those assessment problems and end-of-
chapter problems in the chapters following Chapter 5 that pertain to oper-
ational amplifiers.
There are several appendixes at the end of the book to help readers
make effective use of their mathematical background.Appendix A reviews
Cramer’s method of solving simultaneous linear equations and simple
matrix algebra; complex numbers are reviewed in Appendix B;Appendix C
contains additional material on magnetically coupled coils and ideal trans-
formers;Appendix D contains a brief discussion of the decibel;Appendix E
is dedicated to Bode diagrams; Appendix F is devoted to an abbreviated
table of trigonometric identities that are useful in circuit analysis; and an
abbreviated table of useful integrals is given in Appendix G. Appendix H
provides tables of common standard component values for resistors, induc-
tors, and capacitors, to be used in solving many end-of-chapter problems.
Selected Answers provides answers to selected end-of-chapter problems.

ELECTRIC CIRCUITS
TENTH EDITION

Electrical engineering is an exciting and challenging profession
for anyone who has a genuine interest in, and aptitude for,
applied science and mathematics. Over the past century and a
half, electrical engineers have played a dominant role in the
development of systems that have changed the way people live
and work. Satellite communication links, telephones, digital com-
puters, televisions, diagnostic and surgical medical equipment,
assembly-line robots, and electrical power tools are representa-
tive components of systems that define a modern technological
society.As an electrical engineer, you can participate in this ongo-
ing technological revolution by improving and refining these
existing systems and by discovering and developing new systems
to meet the needs of our ever-changing society.
As you embark on the study of circuit analysis, you need to
gain a feel for where this study fits into the hierarchy of topics
that comprise an introduction to electrical engineering. Hence we
begin by presenting an overview of electrical engineering, some
ideas about an engineering point of view as it relates to circuit
analysis, and a review of the international system of units.
We then describe generally what circuit analysis entails. Next,
we introduce the concepts of voltage and current.We follow these
concepts with discussion of an ideal basic element and the need
for a polarity reference system. We conclude the chapter by
describing how current and voltage relate to power and energy.

CHAPTER
2

One of the most important skills you will develop is the
ability to check your answers for the circuits you design
and analyze using the tools developed in this text. A com-
mon method used to check for valid answers is to balance
the power in the circuit. The linear circuits we study have
no net power, so the sum of the power associated with each
circuit component must be zero. If the total power for 
the circuit is zero, we say that the power balances, but if
the total power is not zero, we need to find the errors in
our calculation.
As an example, we will consider a very simple model for
the distribution of electricity to a typical home, as shown
below. (Note that a more realistic model will be investigated
in the Practical Perspective for Chapter 9.) The components
labeled a and b represent the electrical source to the home.
The components labeled c, d, and e represent the wires that
carry the electrical current from the source to the devices in
the home requiring electrical power. The components labeled
f, g, and h represent lamps, televisions, hair dryers, refriger-
ators, and other devices that require power.
Once we have introduced the concepts of voltage, current,
power, and energy, we will examine this circuit model in detail,
and use a power balance to determine whether the results of
analyzing this circuit are correct.

1.1 Electrical Engineering: An Overview
Electrical engineering is the profession concerned with systems that
produce, transmit, and measure electric signals. Electrical engineering
combines the physicist’s models of natural phenomena with the mathe-
matician’s tools for manipulating those models to produce systems that
meet practical needs. Electrical systems pervade our lives; they are found
in homes, schools, workplaces, and transportation vehicles everywhere.
We begin by presenting a few examples from each of the five major class-
ifications of electrical systems:
•
communication systems
•
computer systems
•
control systems
•
power systems
•
signal-processing systems
Then we describe how electrical engineers analyze and design such systems.
Communication systems are electrical systems that generate, trans-
mit, and distribute information. Well-known examples include television
equipment, such as cameras, transmitters, receivers, and VCRs; radio tele-
scopes, used to explore the universe; satellite systems, which return images
of other planets and our own; radar systems, used to coordinate plane
flights; and telephone systems.
Figure 1.1 depicts the major components of a modern telephone sys-
tem. Starting at the left of the figure, inside a telephone, a microphone turns
sound waves into electric signals. These signals are carried to a switching
center where they are combined with the signals from tens, hundreds, or
thousands of other telephones. The combined signals leave the switching
center; their form depends on the distance they must travel. In our example,
they are sent through wires in underground coaxial cables to a microwave
transmission station. Here, the signals are transformed into microwave fre-
quencies and broadcast from a transmission antenna through air and space,
via a communications satellite, to a receiving antenna. The microwave
receiving station translates the microwave signals into a form suitable for
further transmission,perhaps as pulses of light to be sent through fiber-optic
cable. On arrival at the second switching center, the combined signals are
separated, and each is routed to the appropriate telephone, where an ear-
phone acts as a speaker to convert the received electric signals back into
sound waves. At each stage of the process, electric circuits operate on the
signals. Imagine the challenge involved in designing, building, and operating
each circuit in a way that guarantees that all of the hundreds of thousands of
simultaneous calls have high-quality connections.
Computer systems use electric signals to process information rang-
ing from word processing to mathematical computations. Systems range
in size and power from pocket calculators to personal computers to
supercomputers that perform such complex tasks as processing weather
data and modeling chemical interactions of complex organic molecules.
These systems include networks of microcircuits, or integrated circuits—
postage-stampsized assemblies of hundreds, thousands, or millions of
electrical components that often operate at speeds and power levels close
to fundamental physical limits, including the speed of light and the thermo-
dynamic laws.
Control systems use electric signals to regulate processes. Examples
include the control of temperatures, pressures, and flow rates in an oil
refinery; the fuel-air mixture in a fuel-injected automobile engine; mecha-
nisms such as the motors, doors, and lights in elevators; and the locks in the

Panama Canal.The autopilot and autolanding systems that help to fly and
land airplanes are also familiar control systems.
Power systems generate and distribute electric power. Electric power,
which is the foundation of our technology-based society, usually is gener-
ated in large quantities by nuclear, hydroelectric, and thermal (coal-, oil-,
or gas-fired) generators. Power is distributed by a grid of conductors that
crisscross the country. A major challenge in designing and operating such
a system is to provide sufficient redundancy and control so that failure of
any piece of equipment does not leave a city, state, or region completely
without power.
Signal-processing systems act on electric signals that represent infor-
mation.They transform the signals and the information contained in them
into a more suitable form. There are many different ways to process the
signals and their information. For example, image-processing systems
gather massive quantities of data from orbiting weather satellites, reduce
the amount of data to a manageable level, and transform the remaining
data into a video image for the evening news broadcast. A computerized
tomography (CT) scan is another example of an image-processing system.
It takes signals generated by a special X-ray machine and transforms them
into an image such as the one in Fig. 1.2. Although the original X-ray sig-
nals are of little use to a physician, once they are processed into a recog-
nizable image the information they contain can be used in the diagnosis of
disease and injury.
Considerable interaction takes place among the engineering disci-
plines involved in designing and operating these five classes of systems.
Thus communications engineers use digital computers to control the flow
of information. Computers contain control systems, and control systems
contain computers. Power systems require extensive communications sys-
tems to coordinate safely and reliably the operation of components, which
may be spread across a continent.A signal-processing system may involve
a communications link, a computer, and a control system.
A good example of the interaction among systems is a commercial
airplane, such as the one shown in Fig. 1.3. A sophisticated communica-
tions system enables the pilot and the air traffic controller to monitor the
plane’s location, permitting the air traffic controller to design a safe flight
path for all of the nearby aircraft and enabling the pilot to keep the plane
on its designated path. On the newest commercial airplanes, an onboard
computer system is used for managing engine functions, implementing
the navigation and flight control systems, and generating video informa-
tion screens in the cockpit. A complex control system uses cockpit com-
mands to adjust the position and speed of the airplane, producing the
appropriate signals to the engines and the control surfaces (such as the
wing flaps, ailerons, and rudder) to ensure the plane remains safely air-
borne and on the desired flight path. The plane must have its own power
system to stay aloft and to provide and distribute the electric power
needed to keep the cabin lights on, make the coffee, and show the movie.
Signal-processing systems reduce the noise in air traffic communications
and transform information about the plane’s location into the more
meaningful form of a video display in the cockpit. Engineering challenges
abound in the design of each of these systems and their integration into a
coherent whole. For example, these systems must operate in widely vary-
ing and unpredictable environmental conditions. Perhaps the most
important engineering challenge is to guarantee that sufficient redun-
dancy is incorporated in the designs to ensure that passengers arrive
safely and on time at their desired destinations.
Although electrical engineers may be interested primarily in one
area, they must also be knowledgeable in other areas that interact with
this area of interest. This interaction is part of what makes electrical

engineering a challenging and exciting profession. The emphasis in engi-
neering is on making things work, so an engineer is free to acquire and
use any technique, from any field, that helps to get the job done.
Circuit Theory
In a field as diverse as electrical engineering, you might well ask whether
all of its branches have anything in common. The answer is yes—electric
circuits. An electric circuit is a mathematical model that approximates
the behavior of an actual electrical system.As such, it provides an impor-
tant foundation for learning—in your later courses and as a practicing
engineer—the details of how to design and operate systems such as those
just described.The models, the mathematical techniques, and the language
of circuit theory will form the intellectual framework for your future engi-
neering endeavors.
Note that the term electric circuit is commonly used to refer to an
actual electrical system as well as to the model that represents it. In this
text, when we talk about an electric circuit, we always mean a model,
unless otherwise stated. It is the modeling aspect of circuit theory that has
broad applications across engineering disciplines.
Circuit theory is a special case of electromagnetic field theory:the study
of static and moving electric charges. Although generalized field theory
might seem to be an appropriate starting point for investigating electric sig-
nals, its application is not only cumbersome but also requires the use of
advanced mathematics. Consequently, a course in electromagnetic field 
theory is not a prerequisite to understanding the material in this book. We
do, however, assume that you have had an introductory physics course in
which electrical and magnetic phenomena were discussed.
Three basic assumptions permit us to use circuit theory, rather than
electromagnetic field theory, to study a physical system represented by an
electric circuit.These assumptions are as follows:
1. Electrical effects happen instantaneously throughout a system. We
can make this assumption because we know that electric signals
travel at or near the speed of light. Thus, if the system is physically
small, electric signals move through it so quickly that we can con-
sider them to affect every point in the system simultaneously.A sys-
tem that is small enough so that we can make this assumption is
called a lumped-parameter system.
2. The net charge on every component in the system is always zero.
Thus no component can collect a net excess of charge, although
some components, as you will learn later, can hold equal but oppo-
site separated charges.
3. There is no magnetic coupling between the components in a system.
As we demonstrate later, magnetic coupling can occur within a
component.
That’s it; there are no other assumptions. Using circuit theory provides
simple solutions (of sufficient accuracy) to problems that would become
hopelessly complicated if we were to use electromagnetic field theory.
These benefits are so great that engineers sometimes specifically design
electrical systems to ensure that these assumptions are met. The impor-
tance of assumptions 2 and 3 becomes apparent after we introduce the
basic circuit elements and the rules for analyzing interconnected elements.
However, we need to take a closer look at assumption 1.The question
is, “How small does a physical system have to be to qualify as a lumped-
parameter system?” We can get a quantitative handle on the question by
noting that electric signals propagate by wave phenomena. If the wave-
length of the signal is large compared to the physical dimensions of the

1.1

7
system, we have a lumped-parameter system. The wavelength
is the
velocity divided by the repetition rate, or frequency, of the signal; that is,
. The frequency f is measured in hertz (Hz). For example, power
systems in the United States operate at 60 Hz. If we use the speed of light
(
) as the velocity of propagation, the wavelength is
m. If the power system of interest is physically smaller than this
wavelength, we can represent it as a lumped-parameter system and use cir-
cuit theory to analyze its behavior. How do we define smaller? A good rule
is the 
: If the dimension of the system is 
(or smaller)
of the dimension of the wavelength, you have a lumped-parameter system.
Thus, as long as the physical dimension of the power system is less than
m, we can treat it as a lumped-parameter system.
On the other hand, the propagation frequency of radio signals is on the
order of 
Hz.Thus the wavelength is 0.3 m. Using the rule of 
, the
relevant dimensions of a communication system that sends or receives radio
signals must be less than 3 cm to qualify as a lumped-parameter system.
Whenever any of the pertinent physical dimensions of a system under study
approaches the wavelength of its signals, we must use electromagnetic field
theory to analyze that system. Throughout this book we study circuits
derived from lumped-parameter systems.
Problem Solving
As a practicing engineer, you will not be asked to solve problems that
have already been solved. Whether you are trying to improve the per-
formance of an existing system or creating a new system, you will be work-
ing on unsolved problems.As a student, however, you will devote much of
your attention to the discussion of problems already solved. By reading
about and discussing how these problems were solved in the past, and by
solving related homework and exam problems on your own, you will
begin to develop the skills to successfully attack the unsolved problems
you’ll face as a practicing engineer.
Some general problem-solving procedures are presented here. Many
of them pertain to thinking about and organizing your solution strategy
before proceeding with calculations.
1. Identify what’s given and what’s to be found. In problem solving, you
need to know your destination before you can select a route for get-
ting there. What is the problem asking you to solve or find?
Sometimes the goal of the problem is obvious; other times you may
need to paraphrase or make lists or tables of known and unknown
information to see your objective.
The problem statement may contain extraneous information
that you need to weed out before proceeding. On the other hand, it
may offer incomplete information or more complexities than can be
handled given the solution methods at your disposal. In that case,
you’ll need to make assumptions to fill in the missing information or
simplify the problem context. Be prepared to circle back and recon-
sider supposedly extraneous information and/or your assumptions if
your calculations get bogged down or produce an answer that doesn’t
seem to make sense.
2. Sketch a circuit diagram or other visual model. Translating a verbal
problem description into a visual model is often a useful step in the
solution process. If a circuit diagram is already provided, you may
need to add information to it, such as labels, values, or reference
directions.You may also want to redraw the circuit in a simpler, but
equivalent, form. Later in this text you will learn the methods for
developing such simplified equivalent circuits.

3. Think of several solution methods and decide on a way of choosing
among them. This course will help you build a collection of analyt-
ical tools, several of which may work on a given problem. But one
method may produce fewer equations to be solved than another,
or it may require only algebra instead of calculus to reach a solu-
tion. Such efficiencies, if you can anticipate them, can streamline
your calculations considerably. Having an alternative method in
mind also gives you a path to pursue if your first solution attempt
bogs down.
4. Calculate a solution. Your planning up to this point should have
helped you identify a good analytical method and the correct equa-
tions for the problem. Now comes the solution of those equations.
Paper-and-pencil, calculator, and computer methods are all avail-
able for performing the actual calculations of circuit analysis.
Efficiency and your instructor’s preferences will dictate which tools
you should use.
5. Use your creativity. If you suspect that your answer is off base or if the
calculations seem to go on and on without moving you toward a solu-
tion, you should pause and consider alternatives. You may need to
revisit your assumptions or select a different solution method.Or,you
may need to take a less-conventional problem-solving approach, such
as working backward from a solution.This text provides answers to all
of the Assessment Problems and many of the Chapter Problems so
that you may work backward when you get stuck. In the real world,
you won’t be given answers in advance, but you may have a desired
problem outcome in mind from which you can work backward. Other
creative approaches include allowing yourself to see parallels with
other types of problems you’ve successfully solved, following your
intuition or hunches about how to proceed, and simply setting the
problem aside temporarily and coming back to it later.
6. Test your solution. Ask yourself whether the solution you’ve
obtained makes sense. Does the magnitude of the answer seem rea-
sonable? Is the solution physically realizable? You may want to go
further and rework the problem via an alternative method. Doing
so will not only test the validity of your original answer, but will also
help you develop your intuition about the most efficient solution
methods for various kinds of problems. In the real world, safety-
critical designs are always checked by several independent means.
Getting into the habit of checking your answers will benefit you as
a student and as a practicing engineer.
These problem-solving steps cannot be used as a recipe to solve every prob-
lem in this or any other course. You may need to skip, change the order of,
or elaborate on certain steps to solve a particular problem. Use these steps
as a guideline to develop a problem-solving style that works for you.
1.2 The International System of Units
Engineers compare theoretical results to experimental results and com-
pare competing engineering designs using quantitative measures. Modern
engineering is a multidisciplinary profession in which teams of engineers
work together on projects, and they can communicate their results in a
meaningful way only if they all use the same units of measure. The
International System of Units (abbreviated SI) is used by all the major
engineering societies and most engineers throughout the world; hence we
use it in this book.

1.2
The International System of Units
9
The SI units are based on seven defined quantities:
•
length
•
mass
•
time
•
electric current
•
thermodynamic temperature
•
amount of substance
•
luminous intensity
These quantities,along with the basic unit and symbol for each,are listed
in Table 1.1.Although not strictly SI units, the familiar time units of minute
(60 s), hour (3600 s), and so on are often used in engineering calculations. In
addition, defined quantities are combined to form derived units. Some, such
as force, energy, power, and electric charge, you already know through previ-
ous physics courses. Table 1.2 lists the derived units used in this book.
In many cases, the SI unit is either too small or too large to use conve-
niently. Standard prefixes corresponding to powers of 10, as listed in
Table 1.3, are then applied to the basic unit. All of these prefixes are cor-
rect, but engineers often use only the ones for powers divisible by 3; thus
centi, deci, deka, and hecto are used rarely.Also, engineers often select the
prefix that places the base number in the range between 1 and 1000.
Suppose that a time calculation yields a result of 
s, that is, 0.00001 s.
Most engineers would describe this quantity as 
,
that is,
, rather than as 0.01 ms or 10,000,000 ps.

1.3 Circuit Analysis: An Overview
Before becoming involved in the details of circuit analysis, we need to
take a broad look at engineering design, specifically the design of electric
circuits. The purpose of this overview is to provide you with a perspective
on where circuit analysis fits within the whole of circuit design. Even
though this book focuses on circuit analysis, we try to provide opportuni-
ties for circuit design where appropriate.
All engineering designs begin with a need, as shown in Fig. 1.4. This
need may come from the desire to improve on an existing design, or it may
be something brand-new. A careful assessment of the need results in
design specifications, which are measurable characteristics of a proposed
design. Once a design is proposed, the design specifications allow us to
assess whether or not the design actually meets the need.
A concept for the design comes next.The concept derives from a com-
plete understanding of the design specifications coupled with an insight into

the need, which comes from education and experience.The concept may be
realized as a sketch, as a written description, or in some other form. Often
the next step is to translate the concept into a mathematical model.A com-
monly used mathematical model for electrical systems is a circuit model.
The elements that comprise the circuit model are called ideal circuit
components. An ideal circuit component is a mathematical model of an
actual electrical component, like a battery or a light bulb. It is important
for the ideal circuit component used in a circuit model to represent the
behavior of the actual electrical component to an acceptable degree of
accuracy. The tools of circuit analysis, the focus of this book, are then
applied to the circuit. Circuit analysis is based on mathematical techniques
and is used to predict the behavior of the circuit model and its ideal circuit
components.A comparison between the desired behavior, from the design
specifications, and the predicted behavior, from circuit analysis, may lead
to refinements in the circuit model and its ideal circuit elements. Once the
desired and predicted behavior are in agreement, a physical prototype can
be constructed.
The physical prototype is an actual electrical system, constructed from
actual electrical components. Measurement techniques are used to deter-
mine the actual, quantitative behavior of the physical system. This actual
behavior is compared with the desired behavior from the design specifica-
tions and the predicted behavior from circuit analysis. The comparisons
may result in refinements to the physical prototype, the circuit model, or
both. Eventually, this iterative process, in which models, components, and
systems are continually refined, may produce a design that accurately
matches the design specifications and thus meets the need.
From this description, it is clear that circuit analysis plays a very
important role in the design process. Because circuit analysis is applied to
circuit models, practicing engineers try to use mature circuit models so
that the resulting designs will meet the design specifications in the first
iteration. In this book, we use models that have been tested for between
20 and 100 years; you can assume that they are mature. The ability to
model actual electrical systems with ideal circuit elements makes circuit
theory extremely useful to engineers.
Saying that the interconnection of ideal circuit elements can be used
to quantitatively predict the behavior of a system implies that we can
describe the interconnection with mathematical equations. For the mathe-
matical equations to be useful, we must write them in terms of measurable
quantities. In the case of circuits, these quantities are voltage and current,
which we discuss in Section 1.4. The study of circuit analysis involves
understanding the behavior of each ideal circuit element in terms of its
voltage and current and understanding the constraints imposed on the
voltage and current as a result of interconnecting the ideal elements.
1.4 Voltage and Current
The concept of electric charge is the basis for describing all electrical phe-
nomena. Let’s review some important characteristics of electric charge.
•
The charge is bipolar, meaning that electrical effects are described in
terms of positive and negative charges.
•
The electric charge exists in discrete quantities, which are integral
multiples of the electronic charge,
•
Electrical effects are attributed to both the separation of charge and
charges in motion.
In circuit theory, the separation of charge creates an electric force (volt-
age), and the motion of charge creates an electric fluid (current).

12
Circuit Variables
The concepts of voltage and current are useful from an engineering
point of view because they can be expressed quantitatively. Whenever
positive and negative charges are separated, energy is expended. Voltage
is the energy per unit charge created by the separation. We express this
ratio in differential form as
(1.1)
where
The electrical effects caused by charges in motion depend on the rate
of charge flow. The rate of charge flow is known as the electric current,
which is expressed as
(1.2)
where
Equations 1.1 and 1.2 are definitions for the magnitude of voltage and
current, respectively.The bipolar nature of electric charge requires that we
assign polarity references to these variables.We will do so in Section 1.5.
Although current is made up of discrete, moving electrons, we do not
need to consider them individually because of the enormous number of
them. Rather, we can think of electrons and their corresponding charge as
one smoothly flowing entity.Thus, i is treated as a continuous variable.
One advantage of using circuit models is that we can model a compo-
nent strictly in terms of the voltage and current at its terminals. Thus two
physically different components could have the same relationship
between the terminal voltage and terminal current. If they do, for pur-
poses of circuit analysis, they are identical. Once we know how a compo-
nent behaves at its terminals, we can analyze its behavior in a circuit.
However, when developing circuit models, we are interested in a compo-
nent’s internal behavior. We might want to know, for example, whether
charge conduction is taking place because of free electrons moving
through the crystal lattice structure of a metal or whether it is because of
electrons moving within the covalent bonds of a semiconductor material.
However, these concerns are beyond the realm of circuit theory. In this
book we use circuit models that have already been developed; we do not
discuss how component models are developed.
1.5 The Ideal Basic Circuit Element
An ideal basic circuit element has three attributes: (1) it has only two ter-
minals, which are points of connection to other circuit components; (2) it is
described mathematically in terms of current and/or voltage; and (3) it
cannot be subdivided into other elements. We use the word ideal to imply
t = the time in seconds.

that a basic circuit element does not exist as a realizable physical compo-
nent. However, as we discussed in Section 1.3, ideal elements can be con-
nected in order to model actual devices and systems. We use the word
basic to imply that the circuit element cannot be further reduced or sub-
divided into other elements.Thus the basic circuit elements form the build-
ing blocks for constructing circuit models, but they themselves cannot be
modeled with any other type of element.
Figure 1.5 is a representation of an ideal basic circuit element.The box
is blank because we are making no commitment at this time as to the type
of circuit element it is. In Fig. 1.5, the voltage across the terminals of the
box is denoted by , and the current in the circuit element is denoted by i.
The polarity reference for the voltage is indicated by the plus and minus
signs, and the reference direction for the current is shown by the arrow
placed alongside the current. The interpretation of these references given
positive or negative numerical values of 
and i is summarized in
Table 1.4. Note that algebraically the notion of positive charge flowing in
one direction is equivalent to the notion of negative charge flowing in the
opposite direction.
The assignments of the reference polarity for voltage and the refer-
ence direction for current are entirely arbitrary. However, once you have
assigned the references, you must write all subsequent equations to
agree with the chosen references. The most widely used sign convention
applied to these references is called the passive sign convention, which
we use throughout this book. The passive sign convention can be stated
as follows:
Whenever the reference direction for the current in an element is in
the direction of the reference voltage drop across the element (as in
Fig. 1.5), use a positive sign in any expression that relates the voltage
to the current. Otherwise, use a negative sign.
We apply this sign convention in all the analyses that follow. Our pur-
pose for introducing it even before we have introduced the different
types of basic circuit elements is to impress on you the fact that the selec-
tion of polarity references along with the adoption of the passive sign
convention is not a function of the basic elements nor the type of inter-
connections made with the basic elements. We present the application
and interpretation of the passive sign convention in power calculations in
Section 1.6.

1.6 Power and Energy
Power and energy calculations also are important in circuit analysis. One
reason is that although voltage and current are useful variables in the analy-
sis and design of electrically based systems, the useful output of the system
often is nonelectrical, and this output is conveniently expressed in terms of
power or energy. Another reason is that all practical devices have limita-
tions on the amount of power that they can handle. In the design process,
therefore, voltage and current calculations by themselves are not sufficient.
We now relate power and energy to voltage and current and at the
same time use the power calculation to illustrate the passive sign conven-
tion. Recall from basic physics that power is the time rate of expending or

Thus 1 W is equivalent to

The power associated with the flow of charge follows directly from
the definition of voltage and current in Eqs. 1.1 and 1.2, or
so
(1.4)
where
Equation 1.4 shows that the power associated with a basic circuit element
is simply the product of the current in the element and the voltage across
the element. Therefore, power is a quantity associated with a pair of ter-
minals, and we have to be able to tell from our calculation whether power
is being delivered to the pair of terminals or extracted from it. This infor-
mation comes from the correct application and interpretation of the pas-
sive sign convention.
If we use the passive sign convention, Eq. 1.4 is correct if the reference
direction for the current is in the direction of the reference voltage drop
across the terminals. Otherwise, Eq. 1.4 must be written with a minus sign.
In other words, if the current reference is in the direction of a reference
voltage rise across the terminals, the expression for the power is
(1.5)
The algebraic sign of power is based on charge movement through
voltage drops and rises. As positive charges move through a drop in volt-
age, they lose energy, and as they move through a rise in voltage, they gain
energy. Figure 1.6 summarizes the relationship between the polarity refer-
ences for voltage and current and the expression for power.

Interpreting algebraic sign of power 
16
Circuit Variables
We can now state the rule for interpreting the algebraic sign of power:
If the power is positive (that is, if 
), power is being delivered to
the circuit inside the box. If the power is negative (that is, if 
),
power is being extracted from the circuit inside the box.
For example, suppose that we have selected the polarity references
shown in Fig. 1.6(b). Assume further that our calculations for the current
and voltage yield the following numerical results:
Then the power associated with the terminal pair 1,2 is
Thus the circuit inside the box is absorbing 40 W.
To take this analysis one step further, assume that a colleague is solv-
ing the same problem but has chosen the reference polarities shown in
Fig. 1.6(c).The resulting numerical values are
Note that interpreting these results in terms of this reference system gives
the same conclusions that we previously obtained—namely, that the cir-
cuit inside the box is absorbing 40 W. In fact, any of the reference systems
in Fig. 1.6 yields this same result.
Example 1.3 illustrates the relationship between voltage, current,
power, and energy for an ideal basic circuit element and the use of the pas-
sive sign convention.
i = -4 A,  v = 10 V,  and  p = 40 W.
p = -(-10)(4) = 40 W.
i = 4 A and v = -10 V.
p 6 0
p 7 0

Relating Voltage, Current, Power, and Energy
Assume that the voltage at the terminals of the ele-
ment in Fig. 1.5, whose current was defined in
Assessment Problem 1.3, is
a) Calculate the power supplied to the element 
at 1 ms.
b) Calculate the total energy (in joules) delivered
to the circuit element.
Solution
a) Since the current is entering the 
terminal of the
voltage drop defined for the element in Fig. 1.5,
we use a 
sign in the power equation.
“+”

t Ú 0.
v = 10e-5000t kV,
t 6 0;
v = 0
b) From the definition of power given in Eq. 1.3,
the expression for energy is
To find the total energy delivered, integrate the
expresssion for power from zero to infinity.
Therefore,
w(t) =
L

p(x)dx
Thus, the total energy supplied to the circuit ele-
ment is 20 J.
 = 200,000(45.4 * 10-6) = 0.908 W.
 p(0.001) = 200,000e-10,000t(0.001) = 200,000e-10
p = vi = (10,000e-5000t)(20e-5000t) = 200,000e-10,000t W.

Balancing Power
A model of the circuitry that distributes power to a typical home is shown in
Fig. 1.7 with voltage polarities and current directions defined for all of the
circuit components. The results of circuit analysis give the values for all of
these voltages and currents, which are summarized in Table 1.4. To deter-
mine whether or not the values given are correct, calculate the power asso-
ciated with each component. Use the passive sign convention in the power
calculations, as shown below.
The power calculations show that components a, b, and d are supplying
power, since the power values are negative, while components c, e, f, g, and
h are absorbing power. Now check to see if the power balances by finding
the total power supplied and the total power absorbed.
ph = vhih = (-220)(-5) = 1100 W
pg = vgig = (120)(4) = 480 W
pf = -vfif = -(-100)(5) = 500 W
pe = veie = (-10)(-9) = 90 W
pd = -vdid = -(10)(1) = -10 W
pc = vcic = (10)(10) = 100 W
pb = -vbib = -(120)(9) = -1080 W
pa = vaia = (120)(-10) = -1200 W

Circuit Variables
•
The International System of Units (SI) enables engineers
to communicate in a meaningful way about quantitative
results. Table 1.1 summarizes the base SI units; Table 1.2
presents some useful derived SI units.(See pages 8 and 9.)
•
Circuit analysis is based on the variables of voltage and
current. (See page 11.)
•
Voltage is the energy per unit charge created by charge
separation and has the SI unit of volt (
).
(See page 12.)
•
Current is the rate of charge flow and has the SI unit of
ampere (
). (See page 12.)
•
The ideal basic circuit element is a two-terminal compo-
nent that cannot be subdivided; it can be described
mathematically in terms of its terminal voltage and cur-
rent. (See page 12.)
i = dq>dt
v = dw>dq
•
The passive sign convention uses a positive sign in the
expression that relates the voltage and current at the
terminals of an element when the reference direction
for the current through the element is in the direction of
the reference voltage drop across the element. (See
page 13.)
•
Power is energy per unit of time and is equal to the
product of the terminal voltage and current; it has the SI
unit of watt (
). (See page 15.)
•
The algebraic sign of power is interpreted as follows:
•
If 
power is being delivered to the circuit or
circuit component.
•
If 
power is being extracted from the circuit or
circuit component. (See page 16.)
p 6 0,
p 7 0,
p = dw>dt = vi
Summary
Something is wrong—if the values for voltage and current in this circuit are
correct, the total power should be zero! There is an error in the data and we
can find it from the calculated powers if the error exists in the sign of a sin-
gle component. Note that if we divide the total power by 2, we get 
,
which is the power calculated for component d. If the power for component
d was 
, the total power would be 0. Circuit analysis techniques from
upcoming chapters can be used to show that the current through component
d should be

There are five ideal basic circuit elements: voltage sources,
current sources, resistors, inductors, and capacitors. In this chap-
ter we discuss the characteristics of voltage sources, current
sources, and resistors. Although this may seem like a small num-
ber of elements with which to begin analyzing circuits, many prac-
tical systems can be modeled with just sources and resistors.They
are also a useful starting point because of their relative simplicity;
the mathematical relationships between voltage and current in
sources and resistors are algebraic.Thus you will be able to begin
learning the basic techniques of circuit analysis with only alge-
braic manipulations.
We will postpone introducing inductors and capacitors until
Chapter 6, because their use requires that you solve integral and
differential equations. However, the basic analytical techniques
for solving circuits with inductors and capacitors are the same as
those introduced in this chapter. So, by the time you need to
begin manipulating more difficult equations, you should be very
familiar with the methods of writing them.

CHAPTER

You want to heat your small garage using a couple of electric
radiators. The power and voltage requirements for each radia-
tor are 1200 W, 240 V. But you are not sure how to wire the
radiators to the power supplied to the garage. Should you use
the wiring diagram on the left, or the one on the right? Does
it make any difference?
Once you have studied the material in this chapter, you
will be able to answer these questions and determine how to
heat the garage. The Practical Perspective at the end of this
chapter guides you through the analysis of two circuits based
on the two wiring diagrams shown below.

2.1 Voltage and Current Sources
Before discussing ideal voltage and current sources, we need to consider
the general nature of electrical sources. An electrical source is a device
that is capable of converting nonelectric energy to electric energy and
vice versa. A discharging battery converts chemical energy to electric
energy, whereas a battery being charged converts electric energy to
chemical energy.A dynamo is a machine that converts mechanical energy
to electric energy and vice versa. If operating in the mechanical-to-elec-
tric mode, it is called a generator. If transforming from electric to
mechanical energy, it is referred to as a motor. The important thing to
remember about these sources is that they can either deliver or absorb
electric power, generally maintaining either voltage or current. This
behavior is of particular interest for circuit analysis and led to the cre-
ation of the ideal voltage source and the ideal current source as basic cir-
cuit elements. The challenge is to model practical sources in terms of the
ideal basic circuit elements.
An ideal voltage source is a circuit element that maintains a pre-
scribed voltage across its terminals regardless of the current flowing in
those terminals. Similarly, an ideal current source is a circuit element that
maintains a prescribed current through its terminals regardless of the
voltage across those terminals. These circuit elements do not exist as
practical devices—they are idealized models of actual voltage and cur-
rent sources.
Using an ideal model for current and voltage sources places an
important restriction on how we may describe them mathematically.
Because an ideal voltage source provides a steady voltage, even if the
current in the element changes, it is impossible to specify the current in
an ideal voltage source as a function of its voltage. Likewise, if the only
information you have about an ideal current source is the value of cur-
rent supplied, it is impossible to determine the voltage across that cur-
rent source. We have sacrificed our ability to relate voltage and current
in a practical source for the simplicity of using ideal sources in circuit
analysis.
Ideal voltage and current sources can be further described as either
independent sources or dependent sources.An independent source estab-
lishes a voltage or current in a circuit without relying on voltages or cur-
rents elsewhere in the circuit.The value of the voltage or current supplied
is specified by the value of the independent source alone. In contrast, a
dependent source establishes a voltage or current whose value depends on
the value of a voltage or current elsewhere in the circuit.You cannot spec-
ify the value of a dependent source unless you know the value of the volt-
age or current on which it depends.
The circuit symbols for the ideal independent sources are shown in
Fig. 2.1. Note that a circle is used to represent an independent source. To
completely specify an ideal independent voltage source in a circuit, you
must include the value of the supplied voltage and the reference polarity,
as shown in Fig. 2.1(a). Similarly, to completely specify an ideal independ-
ent current source, you must include the value of the supplied current and
its reference direction, as shown in Fig. 2.1(b).
The circuit symbols for the ideal dependent sources are shown in
Fig. 2.2. A diamond is used to represent a dependent source. Both the

Voltage and Current Sources

dependent current source and the dependent voltage source may be con-
trolled by either a voltage or a current elsewhere in the circuit, so there
are a total of four variations, as indicated by the symbols in Fig. 2.2.
Dependent sources are sometimes called controlled sources.
To completely specify an ideal dependent voltage-controlled voltage
source, you must identify the controlling voltage, the equation that per-
mits you to compute the supplied voltage from the controlling voltage,
and the reference polarity for the supplied voltage. In Fig. 2.2(a), the con-
trolling voltage is named 
, the equation that determines the supplied
voltage 
is
and the reference polarity for 
is as indicated. Note that 
is a multiply-
ing constant that is dimensionless.
Similar requirements exist for completely specifying the other ideal
dependent sources. In Fig. 2.2(b), the controlling current is , the equation
for the supplied voltage 
is
the reference polarity is as shown, and the multiplying constant 
has the
dimension volts per ampere. In Fig. 2.2(c), the controlling voltage is

the equation for the supplied current 
is
the reference direction is as shown, and the multiplying constant 
has the
dimension amperes per volt. In Fig. 2.2(d), the controlling current is , the
equation for the supplied current 
is
the reference direction is as shown, and the multiplying constant 
is
dimensionless.
Finally, in our discussion of ideal sources, we note that they are
examples of active circuit elements.An active element is one that models
a device capable of generating electric energy. Passive elements model
physical devices that cannot generate electric energy. Resistors, induc-
tors,
and capacitors are examples of passive circuit elements.
Examples 2.1 and 2.2 illustrate how the characteristics of ideal inde-
pendent and dependent sources limit the types of permissible intercon-
nections of the sources.

Circuit Elements
Using the definitions of the ideal independent volt-
age and current sources, state which interconnec-
tions in Fig. 2.3 are permissible and which violate
the constraints imposed by the ideal sources.
Solution
Connection (a) is valid. Each source supplies volt-
age across the same pair of terminals, marked a,b.
This requires that each source supply the same volt-
age with the same polarity, which they do.
Connection (b) is valid. Each source supplies
current through the same pair of terminals, marked
a,b. This requires that each source supply the same
current in the same direction, which they do.
Connection (c) is not permissible. Each source
supplies voltage across the same pair of terminals,
marked a,b. This requires that each source supply
the same voltage with the same polarity, which they
do not.
Connection (d) is not permissible. Each source
supplies current through the same pair of terminals,
marked a,b. This requires that each source supply
the same current in the same direction, which they
do not.
Connection (e) is valid.The voltage source sup-
plies voltage across the pair of terminals marked
a,b.The current source supplies current through the
same pair of terminals. Because an ideal voltage
source supplies the same voltage regardless of the
current, and an ideal current source supplies the
same current regardless of the voltage, this is a per-
missible connection.

Testing Interconnections of Ideal Independent and Dependent Sources
Using the definitions of the ideal independent and
dependent sources, state which interconnections in
Fig. 2.4 are valid and which violate the constraints
imposed by the ideal sources.
Solution
Connection (a) is invalid. Both the independent
source and the dependent source supply voltage
across the same pair of terminals, labeled a,b. This
requires that each source supply the same voltage
with the same polarity.The independent source sup-
plies 5 V, but the dependent source supplies 15 V.
Connection (b) is valid. The independent volt-
age source supplies voltage across the pair of termi-
nals marked a,b. The dependent current source
supplies current through the same pair of terminals.
Because an ideal voltage source supplies the same
voltage regardless of current, and an ideal current
source supplies the same current regardless of volt-
age, this is an allowable connection.
Connection (c) is valid. The independent cur-
rent source supplies current through the pair of ter-
minals marked a,b. The dependent voltage source
supplies voltage across the same pair of terminals.
Because an ideal current source supplies the same
current regardless of voltage, and an ideal voltage
source supplies the same voltage regardless of cur-
rent, this is an allowable connection.
Connection (d) is invalid. Both the independ-
ent source and the dependent source supply current
through the same pair of terminals, labeled a,b.This
requires that each source supply the same current
in the same reference direction. The independent
source supplies 2 A, but the dependent source sup-
plies 6 A in the opposite direction.

2.2 Electrical Resistance (Ohm’s Law)
Resistance is the capacity of materials to impede the flow of current or,
more specifically, the flow of electric charge. The circuit element used to
model this behavior is the resistor. Figure 2.5 shows the circuit symbol for
the resistor, with R denoting the resistance value of the resistor.
Conceptually, we can understand resistance if we think about the
moving electrons that make up electric current interacting with and being
resisted by the atomic structure of the material through which they are
moving. In the course of these interactions, some amount of electric
energy is converted to thermal energy and dissipated in the form of heat.
This effect may be undesirable. However, many useful electrical devices
take advantage of resistance heating, including stoves, toasters, irons, and
space heaters.
Most materials exhibit measurable resistance to current. The amount
of resistance depends on the material. Metals such as copper and alu-
minum have small values of resistance, making them good choices for
wiring used to conduct electric current. In fact, when represented in a cir-
cuit diagram, copper or aluminum wiring isn’t usually modeled as a resis-
tor; the resistance of the wire is so small compared to the resistance of
other elements in the circuit that we can neglect the wiring resistance to
simplify the diagram.
For purposes of circuit analysis, we must reference the current in
the resistor to the terminal voltage. We can do so in two ways: either in
the direction of the voltage drop across the resistor or in the direction
of the voltage rise across the resistor, as shown in Fig. 2.6. If we choose
the former, the relationship between the voltage and current is

Electrical Resistance (Ohm’s Law)

where
If we choose the second method, we must write
(2.2)
where , i, and R are, as before, measured in volts, amperes, and ohms,
respectively.The algebraic signs used in Eqs. 2.1 and 2.2 are a direct conse-
quence of the passive sign convention, which we introduced in Chapter 1.
Equations 2.1 and 2.2 are known as Ohm’s law after Georg Simon
Ohm, a German physicist who established its validity early in the nine-
teenth century. Ohm’s law is the algebraic relationship between voltage
and current for a resistor. In SI units, resistance is measured in ohms. The
Greek letter omega (
) is the standard symbol for an ohm. The circuit
diagram symbol for an 
resistor is shown in Fig. 2.7.
Ohm’s law expresses the voltage as a function of the current. However,
expressing the current as a function of the voltage also is convenient.Thus,
from Eq. 2.1,
(2.3)
or, from Eq. 2.2,
(2.4)
The reciprocal of the resistance is referred to as conductance, is sym-
bolized by the letter G, and is measured in siemens (S).Thus,
(2.5)
An 
resistor has a conductance value of 0.125 S. In much of the profes-
sional literature,the unit used for conductance is the mho (ohm spelled back-
ward), which is symbolized by an inverted omega (
). Therefore we may
also describe an 
resistor as having a conductance of 0.125 mho, (
).
We use ideal resistors in circuit analysis to model the behavior of
physical devices. Using the qualifier ideal reminds us that the resistor
model makes several simplifying assumptions about the behavior of
actual resistive devices. The most important of these simplifying assump-
tions is that the resistance of the ideal resistor is constant and its value
does not vary over time. Most actual resistive devices do not have constant
resistance, and their resistance does vary over time. The ideal resistor
model can be used to represent a physical device whose resistance doesn’t
vary much from some constant value over the time period of interest in
the circuit analysis. In this book we assume that the simplifying assump-
tions about resistance devices are valid, and we thus use ideal resistors in
circuit analysis.
We may calculate the power at the terminals of a resistor in several
ways.The first approach is to use the defining equation and simply calculate

A second method of expressing the power at the terminals of a resis-
tor expresses power in terms of the current and the resistance.
Substituting Eq. 2.1 into Eq. 2.6, we obtain
so
(2.8)
Likewise, substituting Eq. 2.2 into Eq. 2.7, we have
(2.9)
Equations 2.8 and 2.9 are identical and demonstrate clearly that, regard-
less of voltage polarity and current direction, the power at the terminals of
a resistor is positive.Therefore, a resistor absorbs power from the circuit.
A third method of expressing the power at the terminals of a resistor
is in terms of the voltage and resistance.The expression is independent of
the polarity references, so
(2.10)
Sometimes a resistor’s value will be expressed as a conductance rather
than as a resistance. Using the relationship between resistance and con-
ductance given in Eq. 2.5, we may also write Eqs. 2.9 and 2.10 in terms of
the conductance, or

look at the information provided and choose the power equation that uses

Circuit Elements
Having introduced the general characteristics of ideal sources and resis-
tors, we next show how to use these elements to build the circuit model of
a practical system.
2.3 Construction of a Circuit Model
We have already stated that one reason for an interest in the basic circuit
elements is that they can be used to construct circuit models of practical
systems.The skill required to develop a circuit model of a device or system
is as complex as the skill required to solve the derived circuit. Although
this text emphasizes the skills required to solve circuits, you also will need
other skills in the practice of electrical engineering, and one of the most
important is modeling.
We develop circuit models in the next two examples. In Example 2.4
we construct a circuit model based on a knowledge of the behavior of the
system’s components and how the components are interconnected. In
Example 2.5 we create a circuit model by measuring the terminal behavior
of a device.
Example 2.4
Constructing a Circuit Model of a Flashlight
Construct a circuit model of a flashlight.
Solution
We chose the flashlight to illustrate a practical system
because its components are so familiar. Figure 2.9
shows a photograph of a widely available flashlight.
When a flashlight is regarded as an electrical
system, the components of primary interest are the
batteries, the lamp, the connector, the case, and the
switch. We now consider the circuit model for each
component.
A dry-cell battery maintains a reasonably con-
stant terminal voltage if the current demand is not
excessive. Thus if the dry-cell battery is operating
within its intended limits, we can model it with an
ideal voltage source. The prescribed voltage then is
constant and equal to the sum of two dry-cell values.
The ultimate output of the lamp is light energy,
which is achieved by heating the filament in the
lamp to a temperature high enough to cause radia-
tion in the visible range. We can model the lamp
with an ideal resistor. Note in this case that although
the resistor accounts for the amount of electric
energy converted to thermal energy, it does not pre-
dict how much of the thermal energy is converted to
light energy.The resistor used to represent the lamp
does predict the steady current drain on the batter-
ies, a characteristic of the system that also is of inter-
est. In this model,
symbolizes the lamp resistance.
The connector used in the flashlight serves a
dual role. First, it provides an electrical conductive
path between the dry cells and the case. Second, it is
Rl
formed into a springy coil so that it also can apply
mechanical pressure to the contact between the
batteries and the lamp.The purpose of this mechan-
ical pressure is to maintain contact between the two

Hence, in choosing the wire for the connector, we
may find that its mechanical properties are more

important than its electrical properties for the
flashlight design. Electrically, we can model the
connector with an ideal resistor, labeled 
.
The case also serves both a mechanical and an
electrical purpose. Mechanically, it contains all the
other components and provides a grip for the person
using it.Electrically,it provides a connection between
other elements in the flashlight. If the case is metal, it
conducts current between the batteries and the lamp.
If it is plastic, a metal strip inside the case connects
the coiled connector to the switch. Either way, an
ideal resistor, which we denote 
, models the electri-
cal connection provided by the case.
The final component is the switch. Electrically,
the switch is a two-state device. It is either ON or
OFF. An ideal switch offers no resistance to the cur-
rent when it is in the ON state, but it offers infinite
resistance to current when it is in the OFF state.
These two states represent the limiting values of a
resistor; that is, the ON state corresponds to a resis-
tor with a numerical value of zero, and the OFF state
corresponds to a resistor with a numerical value of
infinity. The two extreme values have the descrip-
tive names short circuit (
) and open circuit
(
). Figure 2.10(a) and (b) show the graphical
representation of a short circuit and an open circuit,
respectively. The symbol shown in Fig. 2.10(c) rep-
resents the fact that a switch can be either a short
circuit or an open circuit, depending on the position
of its contacts.
We now construct the circuit model of the
flashlight. Starting with the dry-cell batteries, the
positive terminal of the first cell is connected to
the negative terminal of the second cell, as shown in
Fig. 2.11. The positive terminal of the second cell is
connected to one terminal of the lamp. The other
terminal of the lamp makes contact with one side of
the switch, and the other side of the switch is con-
nected to the metal case.The metal case is then con-
nected to the negative terminal of the first dry cell
by means of the metal spring. Note that the ele-
ments form a closed path or circuit.You can see the
closed path formed by the connected elements in
Fig. 2.11. Figure 2.12 shows a circuit model for the
flashlight.

Figure 2.12  A circuit model for a flashlight.
We can make some general observations about modeling from our
flashlight example: First, in developing a circuit model, the electrical behav-
ior of each physical component is of primary interest. In the flashlight
model, three very different physical components—a lamp, a coiled wire,
and a metal case—are all represented by the same circuit element (a resis-
tor), because the electrical phenomenon taking place in each is the same.
Each is presenting resistance to the current flowing through the circuit.
Second, circuit models may need to account for undesired as well as
desired electrical effects. For example, the heat resulting from the resist-
ance in the lamp produces the light, a desired effect. However, the heat

Constructing a Circuit Model Based on Terminal Measurements
Solution
Plotting the voltage as a function of the current
yields the graph shown in Fig. 2.14(a). The equation
of the line in this figure illustrates that the terminal
voltage is directly proportional to the terminal cur-
rent,
. In terms of Ohm’s law, the device
inside the box behaves like a 
resistor.Therefore,
the circuit model for the device inside the box is a
resistor, as seen in Fig. 2.14(b).
We come back to this technique of using termi-
nal characteristics to construct a circuit model after
introducing Kirchhoff’s laws and circuit analysis.

resulting from the resistance in the case and coil represents an unwanted
or parasitic effect. It drains the dry cells and produces no useful output.
Such parasitic effects must be considered or the resulting model may not
adequately represent the system.
And finally, modeling requires approximation. Even for the basic sys-
tem represented by the flashlight, we made simplifying assumptions in
developing the circuit model. For example, we assumed an ideal switch,
but in practical switches, contact resistance may be high enough to inter-
fere with proper operation of the system. Our model does not predict this
behavior. We also assumed that the coiled connector exerts enough pres-
sure to eliminate any contact resistance between the dry cells. Our model
does not predict the effect of inadequate pressure. Our use of an ideal
voltage source ignores any internal dissipation of energy in the dry cells,
which might be due to the parasitic heating just mentioned. We could
account for this by adding an ideal resistor between the source and the
lamp resistor. Our model assumes the internal loss to be negligible.
In modeling the flashlight as a circuit, we had a basic understanding of
and access to the internal components of the system. However, sometimes
we know only the terminal behavior of a device and must use this infor-
mation in constructing the model. Example 2.5 explores such a modeling
problem.
NOTE: Assess your understanding of this example by trying Chapter Problems 2.14 and 2.15.

Kirchhoff’s Laws

2.4 Kirchhoff’s Laws
A circuit is said to be solved when the voltage across and the current in
every element have been determined. Ohm’s law is an important equation
for deriving such solutions. However, Ohm’s law may not be enough to
provide a complete solution. As we shall see in trying to solve the flash-
light circuit from Example 2.4, we need to use two more important alge-
braic relationships, known as Kirchhoff’s laws, to solve most circuits.
We begin by redrawing the circuit as shown in Fig. 2.15, with the
switch in the ON state. Note that we have also labeled the current and volt-
age variables associated with each resistor and the current associated with
the voltage source. Labeling includes reference polarities, as always. For
convenience, we attach the same subscript to the voltage and current
labels as we do to the resistor labels. In Fig. 2.15, we also removed some of
the terminal dots of Fig. 2.12 and have inserted nodes. Terminal dots are
the start and end points of an individual circuit element.A node is a point
where two or more circuit elements meet. It is necessary to identify nodes
in order to use Kirchhoff’s current law, as we will see in a moment. In
Fig. 2.15, the nodes are labeled a, b, c, and d. Node d connects the battery
and the lamp and in essence stretches all the way across the top of the dia-
gram, though we label a single point for convenience. The dots on either
side of the switch indicate its terminals, but only one is needed to repre-
sent a node, so only one is labeled node c.
For the circuit shown in Fig. 2.15, we can identify seven unknowns:
,
,
, ,
,
, and . Recall that 
is a known voltage, as it represents
the sum of the terminal voltages of the two dry cells, a constant voltage
of 3 V. The problem is to find the seven unknown variables. From alge-
bra, you know that to find n unknown quantities you must solve n simul-
taneous independent equations. From our discussion of Ohm’s law in
Section 2.2, you know that three of the necessary equations are
(2.13)
(2.14)
(2.15)
What about the other four equations?
The interconnection of circuit elements imposes constraints on the
relationship between the terminal voltages and currents.These constraints
are referred to as Kirchhoff’s laws, after Gustav Kirchhoff, who first stated
them in a paper published in 1848. The two laws that state the constraints
in mathematical form are known as Kirchhoff’s current law and
Kirchhoff’s voltage law.
We can now state Kirchhoff’s current law:
The algebraic sum of all the currents at any node in a circuit
equals zero.
To use Kirchhoff’s current law, an algebraic sign corresponding to a
reference direction must be assigned to every current at the node.
Assigning a positive sign to a current leaving a node requires assigning a
negative sign to a current entering a node. Conversely, giving a negative
sign to a current leaving a node requires giving a positive sign to a current
entering a node.

Kirchhoff’s voltage law (KVL) 
Applying Kirchhoff’s current law to the four nodes in the circuit
shown in Fig. 2.15, using the convention that currents leaving a node are
considered positive, yields four equations:
(2.16)
(2.17)
(2.18)
(2.19)
Note that Eqs. 2.16–2.19 are not an independent set, because any one
of the four can be derived from the other three. In any circuit with n nodes,
independent current equations can be derived from Kirchhoff’s
current law.1 Let’s disregard Eq. 2.19 so that we have six independent
equations, namely, Eqs. 2.13–2.18.We need one more, which we can derive
from Kirchhoff’s voltage law.
Before we can state Kirchhoff’s voltage law, we must define a closed
path or loop. Starting at an arbitrarily selected node, we trace a closed
path in a circuit through selected basic circuit elements and return to the
original node without passing through any intermediate node more than
once. The circuit shown in Fig. 2.15 has only one closed path or loop. For
example, choosing node a as the starting point and tracing the circuit
clockwise, we form the closed path by moving through nodes d, c, b, and
back to node a.We can now state Kirchhoff’s voltage law:
The algebraic sum of all the voltages around any closed path in a circuit
equals zero.
To use Kirchhoff’s voltage law, we must assign an algebraic sign (refer-
ence direction) to each voltage in the loop.As we trace a closed path, a volt-
age will appear either as a rise or a drop in the tracing direction.Assigning a
positive sign to a voltage rise requires assigning a negative sign to a voltage
drop. Conversely, giving a negative sign to a voltage rise requires giving a
positive sign to a voltage drop.
We now apply Kirchhoff’s voltage law to the circuit shown in Fig. 2.15.
We elect to trace the closed path clockwise, assigning a positive algebraic
sign to voltage drops. Starting at node d leads to the expression
(2.20)
which represents the seventh independent equation needed to find the
seven unknown circuit variables mentioned earlier.
The thought of having to solve seven simultaneous equations to find
the current delivered by a pair of dry cells to a flashlight lamp is not very
appealing. Thus in the coming chapters we introduce you to analytical
techniques that will enable you to solve a simple one-loop circuit by writ-
ing a single equation. However, before moving on to a discussion of these
circuit techniques, we need to make several observations about the
detailed analysis of the flashlight circuit. In general, these observations are
true and therefore are important to the discussions in subsequent chap-
ters. They also support the contention that the flashlight circuit can be
solved by defining a single unknown.

2.4
Kirchhoff’s Laws
39
First, note that if you know the current in a resistor, you also know the
voltage across the resistor, because current and voltage are directly
related through Ohm’s law.Thus you can associate one unknown variable
with each resistor, either the current or the voltage. Choose, say, the cur-
rent as the unknown variable. Then, once you solve for the unknown cur-
rent in the resistor, you can find the voltage across the resistor. In general,
if you know the current in a passive element, you can find the voltage
across it, greatly reducing the number of simultaneous equations to be
solved. For example, in the flashlight circuit, we eliminate the voltages 
,
, and 
as unknowns.Thus at the outset we reduce the analytical task to
solving four simultaneous equations rather than seven.
The second general observation relates to the consequences of con-
necting only two elements to form a node. According to Kirchhoff’s cur-
rent law, when only two elements connect to a node, if you know the
current in one of the elements, you also know it in the second element.
In other words, you need define only one unknown current for the two
elements. When just two elements connect at a single node, the elements
are said to be in series. The importance of this second observation is
obvious when you note that each node in the circuit shown in Fig. 2.15
involves only two elements. Thus you need to define only one unknown
current. The reason is that Eqs. 2.16–2.18 lead directly to
(2.21)
which states that if you know any one of the element currents, you
know them all. For example, choosing to use 
as the unknown elimi-
nates ,
, and .The problem is reduced to determining one unknown,
namely,
.
Examples 2.6 and 2.7 illustrate how to write circuit equations based
on Kirchhoff’s laws. Example 2.8 illustrates how to use Kirchhoff’s laws
and Ohm’s law to find an unknown current. Example 2.9 expands on the
technique presented in Example 2.5 for constructing a circuit model for a
device whose terminal characteristics are known.

Now we need to identify the components of a cir-
cuit model that will produce the same relation-
ship between voltage and current. Kirchhoff’s
voltage law tells us that the voltage drops across
two components in series. From the equation,
one of those components produces a 30 V drop
regardless of the current.This component can be
modeled as an ideal independent voltage source.
The other component produces a positive volt-
age drop in the direction of the current 
.
Because the voltage drop is proportional to the
current, Ohm’s law tells us that this component
can be modeled as an ideal resistor with a value
of 
. The resulting circuit model is depicted in
the dashed box in Fig. 2.21(b).

2.5
Analysis of a Circuit Containing Dependent Sources
43
A look at the circuit in Fig. 2.22 reveals that
•
Once we know , we can calculate 
using Ohm’s law.
•
Once we know ,we also know the current supplied by the dependent
source 
.
•
The current in the 500 V source is .
There are thus two unknown currents,
and .We need to construct and
solve two independent equations involving these two currents to produce
a value for 
.
From the circuit, notice the closed path containing the voltage source,
the 
resistor, and the 
resistor. We can apply Kirchhoff’s voltage
law around this closed path. The resulting equation contains the two
unknown currents:
(2.22)
Now we need to generate a second equation containing these two
currents. Consider the closed path formed by the 
resistor and the
dependent current source. If we attempt to apply Kirchhoff’s voltage
law to this loop, we fail to develop a useful equation, because we don’t
know the value of the voltage across the dependent current source. In
fact, the voltage across the dependent source is 
, which is the voltage
we are trying to compute. Writing an equation for this loop does not
advance us toward a solution. For this same reason, we do not use the
closed path containing the voltage source, the 
resistor, and the
dependent source.
There are three nodes in the circuit, so we turn to Kirchhoff’s current
law to generate the second equation. Node a connects the voltage source
and the 
resistor; as we have already observed, the current in these two
elements is the same. Either node b or node c can be used to construct the
second equation from Kirchhoff’s current law. We select node b and pro-
duce the following equation:
(2.23)
Solving Eqs. 2.22 and 2.23 for the currents, we get
(2.24)
Using Eq. 2.24 and Ohm’s law for the 
resistor, we can solve for the
voltage 
:
Think about a circuit analysis strategy before beginning to write equa-
tions.As we have demonstrated, not every closed path provides an oppor-

Applying Ohm’s Law and Kirchhoff’s Laws to Find an Unknown Voltage
problem. Choosing a good approach and the appropriate tools will usually
reduce the number and complexity of equations to be solved. Example 2.10
illustrates another application of Ohm’s law and Kirchhoff’s laws to a cir-
cuit with a dependent source. Example 2.11 involves a much more compli-
cated circuit, but with a careful choice of analysis tools, the analysis is
relatively uncomplicated.
Solution
a) A close look at the circuit in Fig. 2.23 reveals that:
•
There are two closed paths, the one on the
left with the current 
and the one on the
right with the current .
•
Once 
is known, we can compute 
.
We need two equations for the two currents.
Because there are two closed paths and both have
voltage sources, we can apply Kirchhoff’s voltage
law to each to give the following equations:
Solving for the currents yields

a) Develop the equations needed to determine the

b) From these equations, devise a formula for com-
puting 
in terms of the circuit element values.

A careful examination of the circuit reveals a total
of six unknown currents, designated ,
,
,
,
,
and 
. In defining these six unknown currents, we
used the observation that the resistor 
is in series
with the dependent current source 
. We now
must derive six independent equations involving
these six unknowns.
a) We can derive three equations by applying
Kirchhoff’s current law to any three of the nodes
a, b, c, and d. Let’s use nodes a, b, and c and label
the currents away from the nodes as positive:
(3) iE - iB - iC = 0.
(2) iB + i2 - i1 = 0,

A fourth equation results from imposing the

and the dependent source:
We turn to Kirchhoff’s voltage law in deriv-
ing the remaining two equations. We need to
select two closed paths in order to use
Kirchhoff’s voltage law. Note that the voltage
across the dependent current source is unknown,
and that it cannot be determined from the source
current 
. Therefore, we must select two
closed paths that do not contain this dependent
current source.
We choose the paths bcdb and badb and
specify voltage drops as positive to yield
b) To get a single equation for 
in terms of 
the known circuit variables, you can follow
these steps:
•
Solve Eq. (6) for , and substitute this solu-
tion for 
into Eq. (2).
•
Solve the transformed Eq. (2) for , and sub-
stitute this solution for

Heating with Electric Radiators
Let’s determine which of the two wiring diagrams introduced at the begin-
ning of this chapter should be used to wire the electric radiators to the
power supplied to the garage. We begin with the diagram shown in Fig. 2.25.
We can turn this into a circuit by modeling the radiators as resistors. The
resulting circuit is shown in Fig. 2.26. Note that each radiator has the same
resistance, R, and is labeled with a voltage and current value.

To find the unknown voltages and currents for the circuit in Fig. 2.26,
begin by writing a KVL equation for the left side of the circuit:
-240 + v1 = 0    Q     v1 = 240 V.
Figure 2.25 A wiring diagram for two
radiators.
Figure 2.26 A circuit based on Fig. 2.25.

Practical Perspective
47
Now write a KVL equation for the right side of this circuit:
Remember that the power and voltage specifications for each radiator are 1200 W,
240 V. Therefore the configuration shown in Fig. 2.25 satisfies the voltage
specification, since each radiator would have a supplied voltage of 240 V.
Next, calculate the value of resistance R that will correctly model
each radiator. We want the power associated with each radiator to be 
1200 W. Use the equation for resistor power that involves the resistance
and the voltage:
Each radiator can be modeled as a 
resistor with a voltage drop of 240 V
and power of 1200 W. The total power for two radiators is thus 2400 W.
Finally, calculate the power supplied by the 240 V source. To do this,
calculate the current in the voltage source, is, by writing a KCL equation at
the top node in Fig. 2.26, and use that current to calculate the power for
the voltage source.

Thus, the total power in the circuit is

0, so the power 
balances.
Now look at the other wiring diagram for the radiators, shown in 
Fig. 2.27. We know that the radiators can be modeled using 
resistors,
which are used to turn the wiring diagram into the circuit in Fig. 2.28.
Start analyzing the circuit in Fig. 2.28 by writing a KVL equation:
.
Next, write a KCL equation at the node labeled a:
.
The current in the two resistors is the same, and we can use that current
in Ohm’s Law equations to replace the two unknown voltages in the KVL
equation:
Use the current in the two resistors to calculate the power for the two
radiators.
Thus, if the radiators are wired as shown in Fig. 2.27, their total power will
be only 600 W. This is insufficient to heat the garage.
Therefore, the way the radiators are wired has a big impact on the
amount of heat that will be supplied. When they are wired using the dia-
gram in Fig. 2.25, 2400 W of power will be available, but when they are
wired using the diagram in Fig. 2.27, only 600 W of power will be available.

Summary
•
The circuit elements introduced in this chapter are volt-
age sources, current sources, and resistors:
•
An ideal voltage source maintains a prescribed 
voltage regardless of the current in the device. An
ideal current source maintains a prescribed current
regardless of the voltage across the device. Voltage
and current sources are either independent, that is,
not influenced by any other current or voltage in the
circuit; or dependent, that is, determined by some
other current or voltage in the circuit. (See pages 26
and 27.)
•
A resistor constrains its voltage and current to be
proportional to each other. The value of the propor-
tional constant relating voltage and current in a
resistor is called its resistance and is measured in
ohms. (See page 30.)
•
Ohm’s law establishes the proportionality of voltage
and current in a resistor. Specifically,
if the current flow in the resistor is in the direction of
the voltage drop across it, or
if the current flow in the resistor is in the direction of
the voltage rise across it. (See page 31.)
v = -iR
v = iR
•
By combining the equation for power,
, with
Ohm’s law, we can determine the power absorbed by a
resistor:
(See page 32.)
•
Circuits are described by nodes and closed paths. A
node is a point where two or more circuit elements join.
When just two elements connect to form a node, they
are said to be in series. A closed path is a loop traced
through connecting elements, starting and ending at the
same node and encountering intermediate nodes only
once each. (See pages 37–39.)
•
The voltages and currents of interconnected circuit ele-
ments obey Kirchhoff’s laws:
•
Kirchhoff’s current law states that the algebraic sum
of all the currents at any node in a circuit equals zero.
(See page 37.)
•
Kirchhoff’s voltage law states that the algebraic sum
of all the voltages around any closed path in a circuit
equals zero. (See page 38.)
•
A circuit is solved when the voltage across and the cur-
rent in every element have been determined. By com-
bining an understanding of independent and dependent
sources, Ohm’s law, and Kirchhoff’s laws, we can solve
many simple circuits.

Our analytical toolbox now contains Ohm’s law and Kirchhoff’s
laws. In Chapter 2 we used these tools in solving simple circuits.
In this chapter we continue applying these tools, but on more-
complex circuits. The greater complexity lies in a greater number
of elements with more complicated interconnections. This chap-
ter focuses on reducing such circuits into simpler, equivalent cir-
cuits. We continue to focus on relatively simple circuits for two
reasons: (1) It gives us a chance to acquaint ourselves thoroughly
with the laws underlying more sophisticated methods, and (2) it
allows us to be introduced to some circuits that have important
engineering applications.
The sources in the circuits discussed in this chapter are lim-
ited to voltage and current sources that generate either constant
voltages or currents; that is, voltages and currents that are invari-
ant with time. Constant sources are often called dc sources. The
dc stands for direct current, a description that has a historical basis
but can seem misleading now. Historically, a direct current was
defined as a current produced by a constant voltage. Therefore, a
constant voltage became known as a direct current, or dc, voltage.
The use of dc for constant stuck, and the terms dc current and 
dc voltage are now universally accepted in science and engineering
to mean constant current and constant voltage.

Simple Resistive Circuits
CHAPTER

Some mobile phones and tablet computers use resistive touch
screens, created by applying a transparent resistive material
to the glass or acrylic screens.  Two screens are typically used,
separated by a transparent insulating layer. The resulting
touch screen can be modeled by a grid of resistors in the 
x-direction and a grid of resistors in the y-direction, as shown
in the figure on the right.
A separate electronic circuit applies a voltage drop across
the grid in the x-direction, between the points a and b in the
circuit, then removes that voltage and applies a voltage drop
across the grid in the y-direction (between points c and d),
and continues to repeat this process. When the screen is
touched, the two resistive layers are pressed together, creating
a voltage that is sensed in the x-grid and another voltage that
is sensed in the y-grid. These two voltages precisely locate the
point where the screen was touched.
How is the voltage created by touching the screen related
to the position where the screen was touched? How are the
properties of the grids used to calculate the touch position? We
will answer these questions in the Practical Perspective at the
end of this chapter. The circuit analysis required to answer these
questions uses some circuit analysis tools developed next.

3.1 Resistors in Series
In Chapter 2, we said that when just two elements connect at a single
node, they are said to be in series. Series-connected circuit elements carry
the same current. The resistors in the circuit shown in Fig. 3.1 are con-
nected in series. We can show that these resistors carry the same current
by applying Kirchhoff’s current law to each node in the circuit. The series
interconnection in Fig. 3.1 requires that
(3.1)
which states that if we know any one of the seven currents, we know them
all. Thus we can redraw Fig. 3.1 as shown in Fig. 3.2, retaining the identity
of the single current 
To find 
we apply Kirchhoff’s voltage law around the single closed
loop. Defining the voltage across each resistor as a drop in the direction of
gives
(3.2)
or
(3.3)
The significance of Eq. 3.3 for calculating 
is that the seven resistors can
be replaced by a single resistor whose numerical value is the sum of the
individual resistors, that is,
(3.4)
and
(3.5)
Thus we can redraw Fig. 3.2 as shown in Fig. 3.3.
In general, if k resistors are connected in series, the equivalent single
resistor has a resistance equal to the sum of the k resistances, or
(3.6)
Note that the resistance of the equivalent resistor is always larger than
that of the largest resistor in the series connection.
Another way to think about this concept of an equivalent resistance is
to visualize the string of resistors as being inside a black box. (An electri-
cal engineer uses the term black box to imply an opaque container; that is,
the contents are hidden from view. The engineer is then challenged to
model the contents of the box by studying the relationship between the
voltage and current at its terminals.) Determining whether the box con-
tains k resistors or a single equivalent resistor is impossible. Figure 3.4
illustrates this method of studying the circuit shown in Fig. 3.2.

Resistors in Parallel

3.2 Resistors in Parallel
When two elements connect at a single node pair, they are said to be in
parallel. Parallel-connected circuit elements have the same voltage across
their terminals.The circuit shown in Fig. 3.5 illustrates resistors connected
in parallel. Don’t make the mistake of assuming that two elements are
parallel connected merely because they are lined up in parallel in a circuit
diagram.The defining characteristic of parallel-connected elements is that
they have the same voltage across their terminals. In Fig. 3.6, you can see
that 
and 
are not parallel connected because, between their respec-
tive terminals, another resistor dissipates some of the voltage.
Resistors in parallel can be reduced to a single equivalent resistor
using Kirchhoff’s current law and Ohm’s law, as we now demonstrate. In
the circuit shown in Fig. 3.5, we let the currents 
and 
be the cur-
rents in the resistors 
through 
respectively. We also let the positive
reference direction for each resistor current be down through the resistor,
that is, from node a to node b. From Kirchhoff’s current law,
(3.7)
The parallel connection of the resistors means that the voltage across each
resistor must be the same. Hence, from Ohm’s law,
(3.8)
Therefore,
(3.9)
Substituting Eq. 3.9 into Eq. 3.7 yields
(3.10)
from which
(3.11)
Equation 3.11 is what we set out to show: that the four resistors in the cir-
cuit shown in Fig. 3.5 can be replaced by a single equivalent resistor. The
circuit shown in Fig. 3.7 illustrates the substitution. For k resistors con-
nected in parallel, Eq. 3.11 becomes
(3.12)
Note that the resistance of the equivalent resistor is always smaller than the
resistance of the smallest resistor in the parallel connection. Sometimes,

using conductance when dealing with resistors connected in parallel is more
convenient. In that case, Eq. 3.12 becomes
(3.13)
Many times only two resistors are connected in parallel. Figure 3.8
illustrates this special case. We calculate the equivalent resistance from
Eq. 3.12:
(3.14)
or
(3.15)
Thus for just two resistors in parallel the equivalent resistance equals
the product of the resistances divided by the sum of the resistances.

resistors in parallel. Example 3.1 illustrates the usefulness of these results.

Solution
We begin by noting that the

with the 
resistor.We therefore replace this series
combination with a 
resistor, reducing the circuit
to the one shown in Fig. 3.10(a).We now can replace
the parallel combination of the

tors with a single resistance of

Before leaving Example 3.1, we suggest that you take the time to
show that the solution satisfies Kirchhoff’s current law at every node and
Kirchhoff’s voltage law around every closed path. (Note that there are
three closed paths that can be tested.) Showing that the power delivered
by the voltage source equals the total power dissipated in the resistors also
is informative. (See Problems 3.1 and 3.2.)

3.3 The Voltage-Divider 
and Current-Divider Circuits
At times—especially in electronic circuits—developing more than one
voltage level from a single voltage supply is necessary. One way of doing
this is by using a voltage-divider circuit, such as the one in Fig. 3.12.
We analyze this circuit by directly applying Ohm’s law and
Kirchhoff’s laws.To aid the analysis, we introduce the current i as shown in
Fig. 3.12(b). From Kirchhoff’s current law,
and 
carry the same cur-
rent.Applying Kirchhoff’s voltage law around the closed loop yields
(3.19)
or
(3.20)
Now we can use Ohm’s law to calculate 
and 
:
(3.21)
(3.22)
Equations 3.21 and 3.22 show that 
and 
are fractions of 
Each frac-
tion is the ratio of the resistance across which the divided voltage is
defined to the sum of the two resistances. Because this ratio is always less
than 1.0, the divided voltages 
and 
are always less than the source
voltage vs.

Simple Resistive Circuits
If you desire a particular value of 
and 
is specified, an infinite
number of combinations of 
and 
yield the proper ratio. For example,
suppose that 
equals 15 V and 
is to be 5 V. Then 
and, from 
Eq. 3.22, we find that this ratio is  satisfied whenever 
Other fac-
tors that may enter into the selection of 
and hence 
include the
power losses that occur in dividing the source voltage and the effects of
connecting the voltage-divider circuit to other circuit components.
Consider connecting a resistor 
in parallel with 
as shown in
Fig. 3.13. The resistor 
acts as a load on the voltage-divider circuit. A
load on any circuit consists of one or more circuit elements that draw
power from the circuit.With the load 
connected, the expression for the
output voltage becomes
(3.23)
where
(3.24)
Substituting Eq. 3.24 into Eq. 3.23 yields
(3.25)
Note that Eq. 3.25 reduces to Eq. 3.22 as 
as it should.
Equation 3.25 shows that, as long as 
the voltage ratio 
is
essentially undisturbed by the addition of the load on the divider.
Another characteristic of the voltage-divider circuit of interest is the
sensitivity of the divider to the tolerances of the resistors. By tolerance we
mean a range of possible values. The resistances of commercially avail-
able resistors always vary within some percentage of their stated value.
Example 3.2 illustrates the effect of resistor tolerances in a voltage-
divider circuit.

The Current-Divider Circuit
The current-divider circuit shown in Fig. 3.15 consists of two resistors con-
nected in parallel across a current source. The current divider is designed
to divide the current

We find the relationship
between the current

3.4 Voltage Division 
and Current Division
We can now generalize the results from analyzing the voltage divider cir-
cuit in Fig. 3.12 and the current-divider circuit in Fig. 3.15.The generaliza-
tions will yield two additional and very useful circuit analysis techniques
known as voltage division and current division. Consider the circuit shown
in Fig. 3.18.
The box on the left can contain a single voltage source or any other
combination of basic circuit elements that results in the voltage shown in
the figure. To the right of the box are n resistors connected in series. We
are interested in finding the voltage drop 
across an arbitrary resistor 
in terms of the voltage . We start by using Ohm’s law to calculate i, the
current through all of the resistors in series, in terms of the current 
and
the n resistors:
(3.29)
The equivalent resistance,
is the sum of the n resistor values
because the resistors are in series, as shown in Eq. 3.6. We apply Ohm’s

across the resistor 
using the current i calculated in Eq. 3.29:
(3.30)
Note that we used Eq. 3.29 to obtain the right-hand side of Eq. 3.30.
Equation 3.30 is the voltage division equation. It says that the voltage
drop 
across a single resistor 
from a collection of series-connected
resistors is proportional to the total voltage drop across the set of series-
connected resistors. The constant of proportionality is the ratio of the sin-
gle resistance to the equivalent resistance of the series connected set of
resistors, or 
Now consider the circuit shown in Fig. 3.19. The box on the left can
contain a single current source or any other combination of basic circuit
elements that results in the current i shown in the figure. To the right of
the box are n resistors connected in parallel. We are interested in finding
the current 
through an arbitrary resistor 
in terms of the current i.We
start by using Ohm’s law to calculate , the voltage drop across each of the
resistors in parallel, in terms of the current i and the n resistors:
(3.31)
The equivalent resistance of n resistors in parallel,
can be calculated
using Eq. 3.12. We apply Ohm’s law a second time to calculate the 
current 
through the resistor 
using the voltage 
calculated in 
Eq. 3.31:
(3.32)
Note that we used Eq. 3.31 to obtain the right-hand side of Eq. 3.32.
Equation 3.32 is the current division equation. It says that the current i
through a single resistor 
from a collection of parallel-connected resis-
tors is proportional to the total current i supplied to the set of parallel-
connected resistors. The constant of proportionality is the ratio of the
equivalent resistance of the parallel-connected set of resistors to the single
resistance, or 
Note that the constant of proportionality in the cur-
rent division equation is the inverse of the constant of proportionality in
the voltage division equation!
Example 3.4 uses voltage division and current division to solve for
voltages and currents in a circuit.

3.5 Measuring Voltage and Current
When working with actual circuits, you will often need to measure volt-
ages and currents. We will spend some time discussing several measuring
devices here and in the next section, because they are relatively simple to
analyze and offer practical examples of the current- and voltage-divider
configurations we have just studied.
An ammeter is an instrument designed to measure current; it is placed
in series with the circuit element whose current is being measured. A
voltmeter is an instrument designed to measure voltage; it is placed in par-
allel with the element whose voltage is being measured.An ideal ammeter
or voltmeter has no effect on the circuit variable it is designed to measure.

That is, an ideal ammeter has an equivalent resistance of 
and func-
tions as a short circuit in series with the element whose current is being
measured. An ideal voltmeter has an infinite equivalent resistance and
thus functions as an open circuit in parallel with the element whose volt-
age is being measured. The configurations for an ammeter used to meas-
ure the current in 
and for a voltmeter used to measure the voltage in 
are depicted in Fig. 3.21.The ideal models for these meters in the same cir-
cuit are shown in Fig. 3.22.
There are two broad categories of meters used to measure continuous
voltages and currents:digital meters and analog meters.Digital meters meas-
ure the continuous voltage or current signal at discrete points in time, called
the sampling times.The signal is thus converted from an analog signal, which
is continuous in time, to a digital signal, which exists only at discrete instants
in time. A more detailed explanation of the workings of digital meters is
beyond the scope of this text and course. However, you are likely to see and
use digital meters in lab settings because they offer several advantages over
analog meters. They introduce less resistance into the circuit to which they
are connected, they are easier to connect, and the precision of the measure-
ment is greater due to the nature of the readout mechanism.
Analog meters are based on the d’Arsonval meter movement which
implements the readout mechanism. A d’Arsonval meter movement con-
sists of a movable coil placed in the field of a permanent magnet.When cur-
rent flows in the coil, it creates a torque on the coil, causing it to rotate and
move a pointer across a calibrated scale. By design, the deflection of the
pointer is directly proportional to the current in the movable coil.The coil is
characterized by both a voltage rating and a current rating. For example,
one commercially available meter movement is rated at 50 mV and 1 mA.
This means that when the coil is carrying 1 mA, the voltage drop across the
coil is 50 mV and the pointer is deflected to its full-scale position. A
schematic illustration of a d’Arsonval meter movement is shown in Fig.3.23.
An analog ammeter consists of a d’Arsonval movement in parallel
with a resistor, as shown in Fig. 3.24.The purpose of the parallel resistor is
to limit the amount of current in the movement’s coil by shunting some of
it through 
An analog voltmeter consists of a d’Arsonval movement in
series with a resistor, as shown in Fig. 3.25. Here, the resistor is used to
limit the voltage drop across the meter’s coil. In both meters, the added
resistor determines the full-scale reading of the meter movement.
From these descriptions we see that an actual meter is nonideal;both the
added resistor and the meter movement introduce resistance in the circuit to
which the meter is attached. In fact, any instrument used to make physical
measurements extracts energy from the system while making measurements.
The more energy extracted by the instruments, the more severely the meas-
urement is disturbed.A real ammeter has an equivalent resistance that is not
zero,and it thus effectively adds resistance to the circuit in series with the ele-
ment whose current the ammeter is reading.A real voltmeter has an equiva-
lent resistance that is not infinite, so it effectively adds resistance to the
circuit in parallel with the element whose voltage is being read.
How much these meters disturb the circuit being measured depends
on the effective resistance of the meters compared with the resistance in
the circuit. For example, using the rule of 
, the effective resistance of
an ammeter should be no more than  
of the value of the smallest
resistance in the circuit to be sure that the current being measured is
nearly the same with or without the ammeter. But in an analog meter, the
value of resistance is determined by the desired full-scale reading we wish
to make, and it cannot be arbitrarily selected. The following examples
illustrate the calculations involved in determining the resistance needed in
an analog ammeter or voltmeter.The examples also consider the resulting
effective resistance of the meter when it is inserted in a circuit.

3.6 Measuring Resistance—
The Wheatstone Bridge
Many different circuit configurations are used to measure resistance. Here
we will focus on just one, the Wheatstone bridge. The Wheatstone bridge
circuit is used to precisely measure resistances of medium values, that is, in
the range of 
to 
In commercial models of the Wheatstone
bridge, accuracies on the order of 
are possible. The bridge circuit
consists of four resistors, a dc voltage source, and a detector.The resistance
of one of the four resistors can be varied, which is indicated in Fig. 3.26 by
the arrow through 
The dc voltage source is usually a battery, which is
indicated by the battery symbol for the voltage source 
in Fig. 3.26. The
detector is generally a d’Arsonval movement in the microamp range and is
called a galvanometer. Figure 3.26 shows the circuit arrangement of the
resistances, battery, and detector where 
and 
are known resistors
and 
is the unknown resistor.
To find the value of 
we adjust the variable resistor 
until there is
no current in the galvanometer. We then calculate the unknown resistor
from the simple expression
(3.33)
The derivation of Eq. 3.33 follows directly from the application of
Kirchhoff’s laws to the bridge circuit. We redraw the bridge circuit as
Fig. 3.27 to show the currents appropriate to the derivation of Eq. 3.33.
When 
is zero, that is, when the bridge is balanced, Kirchhoff’s current
law requires that

We obtain Eq. 3.33 by first dividing Eq. 3.38 by Eq. 3.37 and then solving
the resulting expression for

(3.40)
Now that we have verified the validity of Eq. 3.33, several comments
about the result are in order. First, note that if the ratio 
is unity, the
unknown resistor 
equals 
In this case, the bridge resistor 
must
vary over a range that includes the value 
For example, if the unknown
resistance were 
and 
could be varied from 
, the bridge
could never be balanced.Thus to cover a wide range of unknown resistors,
we must be able to vary the ratio 
In a commercial Wheatstone
bridge,
and 
consist of decimal values of resistances that can be
switched into the bridge circuit. Normally, the decimal values are
so that the ratio 
can be varied from 0.001 to
1000 in decimal steps.The variable resistor 
is usually adjustable in inte-
gral values of resistance from 
Although Eq. 3.33 implies that 
can vary from zero to infinity, the
practical range of 
is approximately 
to 
Lower resistances are
difficult to measure on a standard Wheatstone bridge because of thermo-
electric voltages generated at the junctions of dissimilar metals and
because of thermal heating effects—that is,
effects. Higher resistances
are difficult to measure accurately because of leakage currents. In other
words, if 
is large, the current leakage in the electrical insulation may be
comparable to the current in the branches of the bridge circuit.

3.7 Delta-to-Wye (Pi-to-Tee) Equivalent
Circuits
The bridge configuration in Fig. 3.26 introduces an interconnection of
resistances that warrants further discussion. If we replace the galvano-
meter with its equivalent resistance 
, we can draw the circuit shown in
Fig. 3.28.We cannot reduce the interconnected resistors of this circuit to a
single equivalent resistance across the terminals of the battery if restricted
to the simple series or parallel equivalent circuits introduced earlier in this
chapter. The interconnected resistors can be reduced to a single equiva-
lent resistor by means of a delta-to-wye ( -to-Y) or pi-to-tee ( -to-T)
equivalent circuit.1
The resistors 
, and 
(or 
and 
) in the circuit shown
in Fig. 3.28 are referred to as a delta (
) interconnection because the
interconnection looks like the Greek letter 
It also is referred to as a
pi interconnection because the 
can be shaped into a 
without dis-
turbing the electrical equivalence of the two configurations. The electri-
cal equivalence between the 
and 
interconnections is apparent in
Fig. 3.29.
The resistors 
, and 
(or 
and 
) in the circuit shown in
Fig. 3.28 are referred to as a wye (Y) interconnection because the inter-
connection can be shaped to look like the letter Y. It is easier to see the Y
shape when the interconnection is drawn as in Fig. 3.30.The Y configuration
also is referred to as a tee (T) interconnection because the Y structure can
be shaped into a T structure without disturbing the electrical equivalence of
the two structures.The electrical equivalence of the Y and the T configura-
tions is apparent from Fig. 3.30.
Figure 3.31 illustrates the -to-Y (or 
-to-T) equivalent circuit trans-
formation. Note that we cannot transform the 
interconnection into the
Y interconnection simply by changing the shape of the interconnections.
Saying the 
-connected circuit is equivalent to the Y-connected circuit
means that the 
configuration can be replaced with a Y configuration to
make the terminal behavior of the two configurations identical. Thus if
each circuit is placed in a black box, we can’t tell by external measure-
ments whether the box contains a set of 
-connected resistors or a set of
Y-connected resistors.This condition is true only if the resistance between
corresponding terminal pairs is the same for each box. For example, the
resistance between terminals a and b must be the same whether we use
the 
-connected set or the Y-connected set. For each pair of terminals in
the 
-connected circuit, the equivalent resistance can be computed using
series and parallel simplifications to yield

Solution
We are interested only in the current and power
drain on the 40 V source, so the problem has been
solved once we obtain the equivalent resistance
across the terminals of the source.We can find this
equivalent resistance easily after replacing either
the upper

Y resistances, defined in Fig. 3.33, from Eqs. 3.44 to
3.46. Thus,
Substituting the Y-resistors into the circuit
shown in Fig. 3.32 produces the circuit shown in
Fig. 3.34. From Fig. 3.34, we can easily calculate the
resistance across the terminals of the 40 V source by
series-parallel simplifications:
The final step is to note that the circuit reduces to
an 
resistor across a 40 V source, as shown in
Fig. 3.35, from which it is apparent that the 40 V
source delivers 0.5 A and 20 W to the circuit.

Practical Perspective
Resistive Touch Screens
Begin by analyzing the resistive grid in the x-direction. We model the
resistance of the grid in the x-direction with the resistance Rx, as shown in
Fig. 3.34. The x-location where the screen is touched is indicated by the
arrow. The resulting voltage drop across the resistance Rx is Vx. Touching
the screen effectively divides the total resistance, Rx, into two separate
resistances Rx and (1
)Rx.
From the figure you can see that when the touch is on the far right side
of the screen, 
0, and Vx
0. Similarly, when the touch is on the far
left side of the screen, 
1, and Vx
Vs. If the touch is in between the
two edges of the screen, the value of 
is between 0 and 1 and the two
parts of the resistance Rx form a voltage divider. We can calculate the volt-
age Vx using the equation for voltage division:
.
We can find the value of , which represents the location of the touch
point with respect the far right side of the screen, by dividing the voltage

location on the screen. Typically the screen coordinates are specified in terms
of pixels (short for “picture elements”). For example, the screen of a mobile
phone would be divided into a grid of pixels with px pixels in the x-direction,
and py pixels in the y-direction. Each pixel is identified by its x-location (a
number between 0 and px

py

the screen, as shown in Fig. 3.37.

So far, we have analyzed relatively simple resistive circuits
by applying Kirchhoff’s laws in combination with Ohm’s law. We
can use this approach for all circuits, but as they become struc-
turally more complicated and involve more and more elements,
this direct method soon becomes cumbersome. In this chapter we
introduce two powerful techniques of circuit analysis that aid in
the analysis of complex circuit structures: the node-voltage
method and the mesh-current method. These techniques give us
two systematic methods of describing circuits with the minimum
number of simultaneous equations.
In addition to these two general analytical methods, in this
chapter we also discuss other techniques for simplifying circuits.
We have already demonstrated how to use series-parallel reduc-
tions and -to-Y transformations to simplify a circuit’s structure.
We now add source transformations and Thévenin and Norton
equivalent circuits to those techniques.
We also consider two other topics that play a role in circuit
analysis. One, maximum power transfer, considers the conditions
necessary to ensure that the power delivered to a resistive load by
a source is maximized. Thévenin equivalent circuits are used in
establishing the maximum power transfer conditions. The final
topic in this chapter, superposition, looks at the analysis of cir-
cuits with more than one independent source.

In the last chapter we began to explore the effect of imprecise
resistor values on the performance of a circuit; specifically, on
the performance of a voltage divider. Resistors are manufac-
tured for only a small number of discrete values, and any given
resistor from a batch of resistors will vary from its stated value
within some tolerance. Resistors with tighter tolerance, say
1%, are more expensive than resistors with greater tolerance,
say 10%. Therefore, in a circuit that uses many resistors, it
would be important to understand which resistor’s value has
the greatest impact on the expected performance of the circuit.
In other words, we would like to predict the effect of varying
each resistor’s value on the output of the circuit. If we know
that a particular resistor must be very close to its stated value
for the circuit to function correctly, we can then decide to
spend the extra money necessary to achieve a tighter tolerance
on that resistor’s value.
Exploring the effect of a circuit component’s value on the
circuit’s output is known as sensitivity analysis. Once we have
presented additional circuit analysis techniques, the topic of
sensitivity analysis will be examined.

Techniques of Circuit Analysis
4.1 Terminology
To discuss the more involved methods of circuit analysis, we must define
a few basic terms. So far, all the circuits presented have been planar
circuits—that is, those circuits that can be drawn on a plane with no
crossing branches. A circuit that is drawn with crossing branches still is
considered planar if it can be redrawn with no crossover branches. For
example, the circuit shown in Fig. 4.1(a) can be redrawn as Fig. 4.1(b);
the circuits are equivalent because all the node connections have been
maintained. Therefore, Fig. 4.1(a) is a planar circuit because it can be
redrawn as one. Figure 4.2 shows a nonplanar circuit—it cannot be
redrawn in such a way that all the node connections are maintained and
no branches overlap.The node-voltage method is applicable to both pla-
nar and nonplanar circuits, whereas the mesh-current method is limited
to planar circuits.
Describing a Circuit—The Vocabulary
In Section 1.5 we defined an ideal basic circuit element. When basic cir-
cuit elements are interconnected to form a circuit, the resulting intercon-
nection is described in terms of nodes, paths, branches, loops, and meshes.
We defined both a node and a closed path, or loop, in Section 2.4. Here
we restate those definitions and then define the terms path, branch, and
mesh. For your convenience, all of these definitions are presented in
Table 4.1. Table 4.1 also includes examples of each definition taken from
the circuit in Fig. 4.3, which are developed in Example 4.1.

Simultaneous Equations—How Many?
The number of unknown currents in a circuit equals the number of
branches, b, where the current is not known. For example, the circuit
shown in Fig. 4.3 has nine branches in which the current is unknown.
Recall that we must have b independent equations to solve a circuit 
with b unknown currents. If we let n represent the number of nodes in 
the circuit, we can derive 
independent equations by applying
Kirchhoff’s current law to any set of 
nodes. (Application of the 
current law to the nth node does not generate an independent equation,
because this equation can be derived from the previous 
equations.
See Problem 4.5.) Because we need b equations to describe a given circuit
and because we can obtain 
of these equations from Kirchhoff’s 
current law, we must apply Kirchhoff’s voltage law to loops or meshes 
to obtain the remaining 
equations.
Thus by counting nodes, meshes, and branches where the current 
is unknown, we have established a systematic method for writing the 
necessary number of equations to solve a circuit. Specifically, we apply
Kirchhoff’s current law to 
nodes and Kirchhoff’s voltage law to
loops (or meshes).These observations also are valid in terms
of essential nodes and essential branches. Thus if we let 
represent the
number of essential nodes and 
the number of essential branches where
the current is unknown, we can apply Kirchhoff’s current law at 
nodes and Kirchhoff’s voltage law around 
loops or meshes.
In circuits, the number of essential nodes is less than or equal to the num-
ber of nodes, and the number of essential branches is less than or equal to
the number of branches.Thus it is often convenient to use essential nodes
and essential branches when analyzing a circuit, because they produce
fewer independent equations to solve.
A circuit may consist of disconnected parts.An example of such a cir-
cuit is examined in Problem 4.3. The statements pertaining to the number
of equations that can be derived from Kirchhoff’s current law,
, and
voltage law,
, apply to connected circuits. If a circuit has n
nodes and b branches and is made up of s parts, the current law can be

times, and the voltage law 
times. Any two sepa-
rate parts can be connected by a single conductor.This connection always
causes two nodes to form one node. Moreover, no current exists in the sin-
gle conductor, so any circuit made up of s disconnected parts can always
be reduced to a connected circuit.
The Systematic Approach—An Illustration
We now illustrate this systematic approach by using the circuit shown in
Fig. 4.4. We write the equations on the basis of essential nodes and
branches. The circuit has four essential nodes and six essential branches,
denoted 
, for which the current is unknown.
We derive three of the six simultaneous equations needed by applying
Kirchhoff’s current law to any three of the four essential nodes.We use the
nodes b, c, and e to get
(4.1)
We derive the remaining three equations by applying Kirchhoff’s voltage
law around three meshes. Because the circuit has four meshes, we need to
dismiss one mesh. We choose 
because we don’t know the voltage
across I.1
Using the other three meshes gives

Rearranging Eqs. 4.1 and 4.2 to facilitate their solution yields the set

Introduction to the Node-Voltage Method

Equation 4.4 is not independent, because we can derive it by summing
Eqs. 4.1 and then multiplying the sum by 
Thus Eq. 4.4 is a linear com-
bination of Eqs. 4.1 and therefore is not independent of them. We now
carry the procedure one step further. By introducing new variables, we can
describe a circuit with just 
equations or just 
equations.
Therefore these new variables allow us to obtain a solution by manipulat-
ing fewer equations, a desirable goal even if a computer is to be used to
obtain a numerical solution.
The new variables are known as node voltages and mesh currents.The
node-voltage method enables us to describe a circuit in terms of 
equations; the mesh-current method enables us to describe a circuit in
terms of 
equations. We begin in Section 4.2 with the node-
voltage method.
NOTE: Assess your understanding of this material by trying Chapter
Problems 4.2 and 4.3.
4.2 Introduction to the 
Node-Voltage Method
We introduce the node-voltage method by using the essential nodes of the
circuit. The first step is to make a neat layout of the circuit so that no
branches cross over and to mark clearly the essential nodes on the circuit
diagram, as in Fig. 4.5.This circuit has three essential nodes 
there-
fore, we need two (
) node-voltage equations to describe the circuit.
The next step is to select one of the three essential nodes as a reference node.
Although theoretically the choice is arbitrary, practically the choice for the
reference node often is obvious. For example, the node with the most
branches is usually a good choice.The optimum choice of the reference node
(if one exists) will become apparent after you have gained some experience
using this method. In the circuit shown in Fig. 4.5, the lower node connects
the most branches, so we use it as the reference node.We flag the chosen ref-
erence node with the symbol 
, as in Fig. 4.6.
After selecting the reference node, we define the node voltages on the
circuit diagram.A node voltage is defined as the voltage rise from the ref-
erence node to a nonreference node. For this circuit, we must define two
node voltages, which are denoted 
and 
in Fig. 4.6.
We are now ready to generate the node-voltage equations.We do so by
first writing the current leaving each branch connected to a nonreference
node as a function of the node voltages and then summing these currents to
zero in accordance with Kirchhoff’s current law. For the circuit in Fig. 4.6,
the current away from node 1 through the 
resistor is the voltage drop
across the resistor divided by the resistance (Ohm’s law).The voltage drop
across the resistor, in the direction of the current away from the node, is
Therefore the current in the 1
resistor is 
Figure 4.7
depicts these observations. It shows the 
branch, with the appro-
priate voltages and current.
This same reasoning yields the current in every branch where the cur-
rent is unknown. Thus the current away from node 1 through the 
resistor is 
and the current away from node 1 through the 
resistor
is 
The sum of the three currents leaving node 1 must equal
zero; therefore the node-voltage equation derived at node 1 is

Note that the first term in Eq. 4.6 is the current away from node 2 through
the

the second term is the current away from 
node 2 through the

calculated. Example 4.2 illustrates the use of the node-voltage method.

to find the branch currents ,

b) Find the power associated with each source, and
state whether the source is delivering or absorb-
ing power.
Solution
a) We begin by noting that the circuit has two essen-
tial nodes; thus we need to write a single node-
voltage expression. We select the lower node as
the reference node and define the unknown node
voltage as 
. Figure 4.9 illustrates these deci-
sions. Summing the currents away from node 1
generates the node-voltage equation

4.3 The Node-Voltage Method 
and Dependent Sources
If the circuit contains dependent sources, the node-voltage equations must
be supplemented with the constraint equations imposed by the presence
of the dependent sources. Example 4.3 illustrates the application of the
node-voltage method to a circuit containing a dependent source.

4.4 The Node-Voltage Method: 
Some Special Cases
When a voltage source is the only element between two essential nodes,
the node-voltage method is simplified. As an example, look at the circuit
in Fig. 4.12. There are three essential nodes in this circuit, which means
that two simultaneous equations are needed. From these three essential
nodes, a reference node has been chosen and two other nodes have been
labeled. But the 100 V source constrains the voltage between node 1 and
the reference node to 100 V. This means that there is only one unknown
node voltage (
). Solution of this circuit thus involves only a single node-
voltage equation at node 2:

Figure 4.14  The circuit shown in Fig. 4.13. with the
selected node voltages defined.
Knowing 
we can calculate the current in every branch.You should ver-
ify that the current into node 1 in the branch containing the independent
voltage source is 1.5 A.
In general, when you use the node-voltage method to solve circuits
that have voltage sources connected directly between essential nodes, the
number of unknown node voltages is reduced. The reason is that, when-
ever a voltage source connects two essential nodes, it constrains the differ-
ence between the node voltages at these nodes to equal the voltage of the
source. Taking the time to see if you can reduce the number of unknowns
in this way will simplify circuit analysis.
Suppose that the circuit shown in Fig. 4.13 is to be analyzed using the
node-voltage method. The circuit contains four essential nodes, so we
anticipate writing three node-voltage equations. However, two essential
nodes are connected by an independent voltage source, and two other
essential nodes are connected by a current-controlled dependent voltage
source. Hence, there actually is only one unknown node voltage.
Choosing which node to use as the reference node involves several
possibilities. Either node on each side of the dependent voltage source
looks attractive because, if chosen, one of the node voltages would be
known to be either 
(left node is the reference) or 
(right node
is the reference).The lower node looks even better because one node volt-
age is immediately known (50 V) and five branches terminate there. We
therefore opt for the lower node as the reference.
Figure 4.14 shows the redrawn circuit, with the reference node flagged
and the node voltages defined.Also, we introduce the current i because we
cannot express the current in the dependent voltage source branch as a
function of the node voltages
and 
. Thus, at node 2
(4.9)
and at node 3
(4.10)
We eliminate i simply by adding Eqs. 4.9 and 4.10 to get
(4.11)
The Concept of a Supernode
Equation 4.11 may be written directly, without resorting to the interme-
diate step represented by Eqs. 4.9 and 4.10.To do so, we consider nodes 2
and 3 to be a single node and simply sum the currents away from the
node in terms of the node voltages 
and 
. Figure 4.15 illustrates 
this approach.
When a voltage source is between two essential nodes, we can com-
bine those nodes to form a supernode. Obviously, Kirchhoff’s current
law must hold for the supernode. In Fig. 4.15, starting with the 
branch and moving counterclockwise around the supernode, we gener-
ate the equation

which is identical to Eq. 4.11. Creating a supernode at nodes 2 and 3 has
made the task of analyzing this circuit easier.It is therefore always worth tak-
ing the time to look for this type of shortcut before writing any equations.
After Eq. 4.12 has been derived, the next step is to reduce the expres-
sion to a single unknown node voltage. First we eliminate 
from the
equation because we know that

we faced the task of writing and solving six simultaneous equations. Here
we will show how nodal analysis can simplify our task.
The circuit has four essential nodes: Nodes a and d are connected by
an independent voltage source as are nodes b and c. Therefore the prob-
lem reduces to finding a single unknown node voltage, because

4.5 Introduction to the 
Mesh-Current Method
As stated in Section 4.1, the mesh-current method of circuit analysis enables
us to describe a circuit in terms of 
equations. Recall that a
mesh is a loop with no other loops inside it.The circuit in Fig. 4.1(b) is shown
again in Fig.4.18,with current arrows inside each loop to distinguish it.Recall
also that the mesh-current method is applicable only to planar circuits. The

Figure 4.19  A circuit used to illustrate development
of the mesh-current method of circuit analysis.
circuit in Fig. 4.18 contains seven essential branches where the current is
unknown and four essential nodes.Therefore,to solve it via the mesh-current
method, we must write four 
mesh-current equations.
A mesh current is the current that exists only in the perimeter of a
mesh. On a circuit diagram it appears as either a closed solid line or an
almost-closed solid line that follows the perimeter of the appropriate
mesh.An arrowhead on the solid line indicates the reference direction for
the mesh current. Figure 4.18 shows the four mesh currents that describe
the circuit in Fig. 4.1(b). Note that by definition, mesh currents automati-
cally satisfy Kirchhoff’s current law. That is, at any node in the circuit, a
given mesh current both enters and leaves the node.
Figure 4.18 also shows that identifying a mesh current in terms of a
branch current is not always possible. For example, the mesh current 
is
not equal to any branch current, whereas mesh currents 
and 
can be
identified with branch currents. Thus measuring a mesh current is not
always possible; note that there is no place where an ammeter can be
inserted to measure the mesh current 
The fact that a mesh current can
be a fictitious quantity doesn’t mean that it is a useless concept. On the
contrary, the mesh-current method of circuit analysis evolves quite natu-
rally from the branch-current equations.
We can use the circuit in Fig. 4.19 to show the evolution of the mesh-
current technique.We begin by using the branch currents (
and ) to
formulate the set of independent equations. For this circuit,
and
We can write only one independent current equation, so we need
two independent voltage equations. Applying Kirchhoff’s current law to
the upper node and Kirchhoff’s voltage law around the two meshes gener-
ates the following set of equations:
(4.20)
(4.21)
(4.22)
We reduce this set of three equations to a set of two equations by solving
Eq. 4.20 for 
and then substituting this expression into Eqs. 4.21 and 4.22:
(4.23)
(4.24)
We can solve Eqs. 4.23 and 4.24 for 
and 
to replace the solution of three
simultaneous equations with the solution of two simultaneous equations.
We derived Eqs. 4.23 and 4.24 by substituting the 
current equations
into the 
voltage equations. The value of the mesh-current
method is that, by defining mesh currents, we automatically eliminate the
current equations.Thus the mesh-current method is equivalent to a
systematic substitution of the 
current equations into the
voltage equations. The mesh currents in Fig. 4.19 that are
equivalent to eliminating the branch current 
from Eqs. 4.21 and 4.22 are
shown in Fig. 4.20. We now apply Kirchhoff’s voltage law around the two
meshes, expressing all voltages across resistors in terms of the mesh cur-
rents, to get the equations

4.7 The Mesh-Current Method: 
Some Special Cases
When a branch includes a current source,the mesh-current method requires
some additional manipulations. The circuit shown in Fig. 4.25 depicts the
nature of the problem.
We have defined the mesh currents 
and 
as well as the voltage
across the 5 A current source, to aid the discussion. Note that the circuit
contains five essential branches where the current is unknown and four
essential nodes. Hence we need to write two

equations to solve the circuit. The presence of the current source reduces
the three unknown mesh currents to two such currents, because it con-
strains the difference between 
and 
to equal 5 A. Hence, if we know 
we know 
and vice versa.
However, when we attempt to sum the voltages around either mesh a
or mesh c, we must introduce into the equations the unknown voltage
across the 5 A current source.Thus, for mesh a:
(4.36)
and for mesh c:
(4.37)
We now add Eqs. 4.36 and 4.37 to eliminate 
and obtain
(4.38)
Summing voltages around mesh b gives
(4.39)
We reduce Eqs. 4.38 and 4.39 to two equations and two unknowns by using
the constraint that
(4.40)
We leave to you the verification that, when Eq. 4.40 is combined with
Eqs. 4.38 and 4.39, the solutions for the three mesh currents are
The Concept of a Supermesh
We can derive Eq. 4.38 without introducing the unknown voltage 
by
using the concept of a supermesh. To create a supermesh, we mentally
remove the current source from the circuit by simply avoiding this branch
when writing the mesh-current equations.We express the voltages around
the supermesh in terms of the original mesh currents. Figure 4.26 illus-
trates the supermesh concept. When we sum the voltages around the
supermesh (denoted by the dashed line), we obtain the equation
(4.41)
which reduces to
(4.42)
Note that Eqs. 4.42 and 4.38 are identical. Thus the supermesh has elimi-
nated the need for introducing the unknown voltage across the current
source. Once again, taking time to look carefully at a circuit to identify a
shortcut such as this provides a big payoff in simplifying the analysis.

Mesh-Current Analysis of the Amplifier Circuit
We can use the circuit first introduced in Section 2.5 (Fig. 2.24) to illustrate
how the mesh-current method works when a branch contains a dependent
current source. Figure 4.27 shows that circuit, with the three mesh currents
denoted 
and 
This circuit has four essential nodes and five essential
branches where the current is unknown. Therefore we know that the cir-
cuit can be analyzed in terms of two 
mesh-current equa-
tions.Although we defined three mesh currents in Fig. 4.27, the dependent
current source forces a constraint between mesh currents 
and 
so we
have only two unknown mesh currents. Using the concept of the super-
mesh, we redraw the circuit as shown in Fig. 4.28.
We now sum the voltages around the supermesh in terms of the mesh
currents 
and 
to obtain
(4.43)
The mesh b equation is
(4.44)
The constraint imposed by the dependent current source is
(4.45)
The branch current controlling the dependent current source, expressed
as a function of the mesh currents, is
(4.46)
From Eqs. 4.45 and 4.46,
(4.47)
We now use Eq. 4.47 to eliminate 
from Eqs. 4.43 and 4.44:

You should verify that the solution of Eqs. 4.48 and 4.49 for

4.8 The Node-Voltage Method Versus
the Mesh-Current Method
The greatest advantage of both the node-voltage and mesh-current meth-
ods is that they reduce the number of simultaneous equations that must be
manipulated.They also require the analyst to be quite systematic in terms
of organizing and writing these equations. It is natural to ask, then,“When
is the node-voltage method preferred to the mesh-current method and
vice versa?” As you might suspect, there is no clear-cut answer. Asking a
number of questions, however, may help you identify the more efficient
method before plunging into the solution process:
•
Does one of the methods result in fewer simultaneous equations 
to solve?
•
Does the circuit contain supernodes? If so, using the node-voltage
method will permit you to reduce the number of equations to 
be solved.

4.8
The Node-Voltage Method Versus the Mesh-Current Method
107
•
Does the circuit contain supermeshes? If so, using the mesh-current
method will permit you to reduce the number of equations to 
be solved.
•
Will solving some portion of the circuit give the requested solution?
If so, which method is most efficient for solving just the pertinent
portion of the circuit?
Perhaps the most important observation is that, for any situation, some
time spent thinking about the problem in relation to the various analytical
approaches available is time well spent. Examples 4.6 and 4.7 illustrate the
process of deciding between the node-voltage and mesh-current methods.
Example 4.6
Understanding the Node-Voltage Method Versus Mesh-Current Method
Find the power dissipated in the 
resistor in
the circuit shown in Fig. 4.29.
Figure 4.29  The circuit for Example 4.6.
Solution
To find the power dissipated in the 
resistor,
we need to find either the current in the resistor or
the voltage across it. The mesh-current method
yields the current in the resistor; this approach
requires solving five simultaneous mesh equations,
as depicted in Fig. 4.30. In writing the five equa-
tions, we must include the constraint 
Before going further, let’s also look at the circuit
in terms of the node-voltage method. Note that, once
we know the node voltages, we can calculate either
the current in the 
resistor or the voltage across
it. The circuit has four essential nodes, and therefore
only three node-voltage equations are required to
describe the circuit. Because of the dependent volt-
age source between two essential nodes, we have to
sum the currents at only two nodes. Hence the prob-
lem is reduced to writing two node-voltage equations
and a constraint equation. Because the node-voltage
method requires only three simultaneous equations,
it is the more attractive approach.
Once the decision to use the node-voltage
method has been made, the next step is to select a
reference node.Two essential nodes in the circuit in
Fig. 4.29 merit consideration. The first is the refer-
ence node in Fig. 4.31. If this node is selected, one of
the unknown node voltages is the voltage across the

source. It is understood that a node voltage is a rise
from the reference node; therefore, in Fig. 4.31, we
have not placed the node voltage polarity references

The second node that merits consideration as
the reference node is the lower node in the circuit,
as shown in Fig. 4.32. It is attractive because it has
the most branches connected to it, and the node-
voltage equations are thus easier to write. However,
to find either the current in the 
resistor or
the voltage across it requires an additional calcula-
tion once we know the node voltages 
and 
For
example, the current in the

tor is

Comparing the Node-Voltage and Mesh-Current Methods

Solution
At first glance, the node-voltage method looks
appealing, because we may define the unknown
voltage as a node voltage by choosing the lower ter-
minal of the dependent current source as the refer-
ence node. The circuit has four essential nodes and
two voltage-controlled dependent sources, so the
node-voltage method requires manipulation of
three node-voltage equations and two constraint
equations.

Using Source Transformations to Solve a Circuit
a) For the circuit shown in Fig. 4.37, find the power
associated with the 6 V source.
b) State whether the 6 V source is absorbing or
delivering the power calculated in (a).
Solution
a) If we study the circuit shown in Fig. 4.37, know-
ing that the power associated with the 6 V
source is of interest, several approaches come
to mind. The circuit has four essential nodes
and six essential branches where the current is
unknown. Thus we can find the current in the
branch containing the 6 V source by solving
either three 
mesh-current equa-
tions or three 
node-voltage equations.
Choosing the mesh-current approach involves
[4 - 1]
36 - (4 - 1)]
solving for the mesh current that corresponds
to the branch current in the 6 V source.
Choosing the node-voltage approach involves
solving for the voltage across the 
resistor,
from which the branch current in the 6 V
source can be calculated. But by focusing on
just one branch current, we can first simplify
the circuit by using source transformations.

already on our list of simplifying techniques. We begin expanding this list
with source transformations. A source transformation, shown in Fig. 4.36,
allows a voltage source in series with a resistor to be replaced by a current
source in parallel with the same resistor or vice versa. The double-headed
arrow emphasizes that a source transformation is bilateral; that is, we can
start with either configuration and derive the other.
We need to find the relationship between 
and 
that guarantees the
two configurations in Fig. 4.36 are equivalent with respect to nodes a,b.
Equivalence is achieved if any resistor 
experiences the same current
flow, and thus the same voltage drop, whether connected between nodes
a,b in Fig. 4.36(a) or Fig. 4.36(b).
Suppose

is connected between nodes a,b in

If the current

A question that arises from use of the source transformation depicted
in Fig. 4.38 is,“What happens if there is a resistance 
in parallel with the
voltage source or a resistance 
in series with the current source?” In
both cases, the resistance has no effect on the equivalent circuit that pre-
dicts behavior with respect to terminals a,b. Figure 4.39 summarizes this
observation.
The two circuits depicted in Fig. 4.39(a) are equivalent with respect to
terminals a,b because they produce the same voltage and current in any
resistor 
inserted between nodes a,b. The same can be said for the cir-
cuits in Fig. 4.39(b). Example 4.9 illustrates an application of the equiva-
lent circuits depicted in Fig. 4.39.

4.10 Thévenin and Norton Equivalents
At times in circuit analysis, we want to concentrate on what happens at
a specific pair of terminals. For example, when we plug a toaster into an
outlet, we are interested primarily in the voltage and current at the ter-
minals of the toaster. We have little or no interest in the effect that con-
necting the toaster has on voltages or currents elsewhere in the circuit
supplying the outlet. We can expand this interest in terminal behavior
to a set of appliances, each requiring a different amount of power.
We then are interested in how the voltage and current delivered at the
outlet change as we change appliances. In other words, we want to focus
on the behavior of the circuit supplying the outlet, but only at the out-
let terminals.
Thévenin and Norton equivalents are circuit simplification techniques
that focus on terminal behavior and thus are extremely valuable aids in
analysis. Although here we discuss them as they pertain to resistive cir-
cuits, Thévenin and Norton equivalent circuits may be used to represent
any circuit made up of linear elements.
We can best describe a Thévenin equivalent circuit by reference to
Fig. 4.44, which represents any circuit made up of sources (both inde-
pendent and dependent) and resistors. The letters a and b denote the
pair of terminals of interest. Figure 4.44(b) shows the Thévenin equiva-
lent. Thus, a Thévenin equivalent circuit is an independent voltage
source 
in series with a resistor 
which replaces an interconnec-
tion of sources and resistors. This series combination of 
and 
is
equivalent to the original circuit in the sense that, if we connect the
same load across the terminals a,b of each circuit, we get the same volt-
age and current at the terminals of the load. This equivalence holds for
all possible values of load resistance.
To represent the original circuit by its Thévenin equivalent, we must
be able to determine the Thévenin voltage 
and the Thévenin resist-
ance 
First, we note that if the load resistance is infinitely large, we
have an open-circuit condition. The open-circuit voltage at the terminals
a,b in the circuit shown in Fig. 4.44(b) is

Techniques of Circuit Analysis
the same as the open-circuit voltage at the terminals a,b in the original 
circuit. Therefore, to calculate the Thévenin voltage 
we simply calcu-
late the open-circuit voltage in the original circuit.
Reducing the load resistance to zero gives us a short-circuit condition.
If we place a short circuit across the terminals a,b of the Thévenin equiva-
lent circuit, the short-circuit current directed from a to b is
(4.55)
By hypothesis,this short-circuit current must be identical to the short-circuit
current that exists in a short circuit placed across the terminals a,b of the
original network. From Eq. 4.55,
(4.56)
Thus the Thévenin resistance is the ratio of the open-circuit voltage to the
short-circuit current.
Finding a Thévenin Equivalent
To find the Thévenin equivalent of the circuit shown in Fig. 4.45, we first
calculate the open-circuit voltage of 
Note that when the terminals a,b
are open, there is no current in the 
resistor.Therefore the open-circuit
voltage 
is identical to the voltage across the 3 A current source, labeled
. We find the voltage by solving a single node-voltage equation.
Choosing the lower node as the reference node, we get
(4.57)
Solving for 
yields
(4.58)
Hence the Thévenin voltage for the circuit is 32 V.
The next step is to place a short circuit across the terminals and calcu-
late the resulting short-circuit current. Figure 4.46 shows the circuit with
the short in place. Note that the short-circuit current is in the direction of
the open-circuit voltage drop across the terminals a,b. If the short-circuit
current is in the direction of the open-circuit voltage rise across the termi-
nals, a minus sign must be inserted in Eq. 4.56.
The short-circuit current (
) is found easily once 
is known.Therefore
the problem reduces to finding 
with the short in place.Again,if we use the
lower node as the reference node, the equation for 
becomes

Hence, the short-circuit current is

from Eqs. 4.58 and 4.61 into Eq. 4.56:
(4.62)
Figure 4.47 shows the Thévenin equivalent for the circuit shown in Fig. 4.45.
You should verify that, if a 
resistor is connected across the ter-
minals a,b in Fig. 4.45, the voltage across the resistor will be 24 V and
the current in the resistor will be 1 A, as would be the case with the
Thévenin circuit in Fig. 4.47. This same equivalence between the circuit
in Figs. 4.45 and 4.47 holds for any resistor value connected between
nodes a,b.
The Norton Equivalent
A Norton equivalent circuit consists of an independent current source
in parallel with the Norton equivalent resistance. We can derive it from
a Thévenin equivalent circuit simply by making a source transforma-
tion. Thus the Norton current equals the short-circuit current at the 
terminals of interest, and the Norton resistance is identical to the
Thévenin resistance.
Using Source Transformations
Sometimes we can make effective use of source transformations to
derive a Thévenin or Norton equivalent circuit. For example, we can
derive the Thévenin and Norton equivalents of the circuit shown 
in Fig. 4.45 by making the series of source transformations shown in 
Fig. 4.48. This technique is most useful when the network contains only
independent sources. The presence of dependent sources requires
retaining the identity of the controlling voltages and/or currents, and
this constraint usually prohibits continued reduction of the circuit 
by source transformations. We discuss the problem of finding the
Thévenin equivalent when a circuit contains dependent sources in
Example 4.10.

Find the Thévenin equivalent for the circuit con-

Figure 4.49  A circuit used to illustrate a Thévenin equivalent

Solution
The first step in analyzing the circuit in Fig. 4.49 is
to recognize that the current labeled 
must be
zero. (Note the absence of a return path for 
to
enter the left-hand portion of the circuit.) The
open-circuit, or Thévenin, voltage will be the volt-
age across the

The current i is
In writing the equation for i, we recognize that the
Thévenin voltage is identical to the control voltage.
When we combine these two equations, we obtain
To calculate the short-circuit current, we place
a short circuit across a,b.When the terminals a,b are
shorted together, the control voltage is reduced to
zero. Therefore, with the short in place, the circuit
shown in Fig. 4.49 becomes the one shown in
Fig. 4.50. With the short circuit shunting the 
resistor, all the current from the dependent current
source appears in the short, so

ods generally are simpler to use.The first is useful if the network contains
only independent sources. To calculate 
for such a network, we first
deactivate all independent sources and then calculate the resistance seen
looking into the network at the designated terminal pair.A voltage source
is deactivated by replacing it with a short circuit.A current source is deac-

the circuit to the one shown in Fig. 4.53. The resistance seen looking into

Techniques of Circuit Analysis
If the circuit or network contains dependent sources, an alternative
procedure for finding the Thévenin resistance 
is as follows. We first
deactivate all independent sources, and we then apply either a test voltage
source or a test current source to the Thévenin terminals a,b.The Thévenin
resistance equals the ratio of the voltage across the test source to the cur-
rent delivered by the test source. Example 4.11 illustrates this alternative
procedure for finding

we will know the voltage of the dependent voltage
source and hence the controlling current i.Therefore
we opt for the test voltage source. Figure 4.54 shows

In general, these computations are easier than those involved in com-

indeterminate.That is, it is the ratio

Techniques of Circuit Analysis
4.12 Maximum Power Transfer
Circuit analysis plays an important role in the analysis of systems designed
to transfer power from a source to a load. We discuss power transfer in
terms of two basic types of systems. The first emphasizes the efficiency of
the power transfer. Power utility systems are a good example of this type
because they are concerned with the generation, transmission, and distri-
bution of large quantities of electric power. If a power utility system is
inefficient, a large percentage of the power generated is lost in the trans-
mission and distribution processes, and thus wasted.
The second basic type of system emphasizes the amount of power trans-
ferred. Communication and instrumentation systems are good examples
because in the transmission of information, or data, via electric signals, the
power available at the transmitter or detector is limited.Thus,transmitting as
much of this power as possible to the receiver, or load, is desirable. In such
applications the amount of power being transferred is small,so the efficiency
of transfer is not a primary concern. We now consider maximum power
transfer in systems that can be modeled by a purely resistive circuit.
Maximum power transfer can best be described with the aid of the cir-
cuit shown in Fig. 4.58.We assume a resistive network containing independ-
ent and dependent sources and a designated pair of terminals, a,b, to which a
load,
is to be connected.The problem is to determine the value of 
that
permits maximum power delivery to 
The first step in this process is to
recognize that a resistive network can always be replaced by its Thévenin
equivalent. Therefore, we redraw the circuit shown in Fig. 4.58 as the one
shown in Fig.4.59.Replacing the original network by its Thévenin equivalent
greatly simplifies the task of finding 
Derivation of 
requires express-
ing the power dissipated in 
as a function of the three circuit parameters
and 
Thus
(4.73)
Next, we recognize that for a given circuit,
and 
will be fixed.
Therefore the power dissipated is a function of the single variable 
To
find the value of 
that maximizes the power, we use elementary calculus.
We begin by writing an equation for the derivative of p with respect to 
:
(4.74)
The derivative is zero and p is maximized when
(4.75)
Solving Eq. 4.75 yields
(4.76)
Thus maximum power transfer occurs when the load resistance 
equals
the Thévenin resistance 
To find the maximum power delivered to 
we simply substitute Eq. 4.76 into Eq. 4.73:

4.13 Superposition
A linear system obeys the principle of superposition, which states that
whenever a linear system is excited, or driven, by more than one inde-
pendent source of energy, the total response is the sum of the individual
responses. An individual response is the result of an independent source
acting alone. Because we are dealing with circuits made up of inter-
connected linear-circuit elements, we can apply the principle of superposi-
tion directly to the analysis of such circuits when they are driven by more
than one independent energy source.At present, we restrict the discussion
to simple resistive networks; however, the principle is applicable to any
linear system.
Superposition is applied in both the analysis and the design of circuits.
In analyzing a complex circuit with multiple independent voltage and cur-
rent sources, there are often fewer, simpler equations to solve when the
effects of the independent sources are considered one at a time. Applying
superposition can thus simplify circuit analysis. Be aware, though, that
sometimes applying superposition actually complicates the analysis,produc-
ing more equations to solve than with an alternative method. Superposition
is required only if the independent sources in a circuit are fundamentally
different. In these early chapters, all independent sources are dc sources, so
superposition is not required. We introduce superposition here in anticipa-
tion of later chapters in which circuits will require it.
Superposition is applied in design to synthesize a desired circuit
response that could not be achieved in a circuit with a single source. If the
desired circuit response can be written as a sum of two or more terms, the
response can be realized by including one independent source for each
term of the response.This approach to the design of circuits with complex
responses allows a designer to consider several simple designs instead of
one complex design.

Figure 4.63  The circuit shown in Fig. 4.62 with the
current source deactivated.
We demonstrate the superposition principle by using it to find the
branch currents in the circuit shown in Fig. 4.62. We begin by finding the
branch currents resulting from the 120 V voltage source. We denote those
currents with a prime. Replacing the ideal current source with an open cir-
cuit deactivates it; Fig. 4.63 shows this. The branch currents in this circuit
are the result of only the voltage source.
We can easily find the branch currents in the circuit in Fig. 4.63 once
we know the node voltage across the 
resistor. Denoting this voltage
we write
(4.78)
from which
(4.79)
Now we can write the expressions for the branch currents 
directly:
(4.80)
(4.81)
(4.82)
To find the component of the branch currents resulting from the current
source, we deactivate the ideal voltage source and solve the circuit shown in
Fig. 4.64. The double-prime notation for the currents indicates they are the
components of the total current resulting from the ideal current source.
We determine the branch currents in the circuit shown in Fig. 4.64 by
first solving for the node voltages across the 3 and 
resistors, respec-
tively. Figure 4.65 shows the two node voltages. The two node-voltage
equations that describe the circuit are
(4.83)
(4.84)
Solving Eqs. 4.83 and 4.84 for 
and 
we get
(4.85)

Now we can write the branch currents 
through

node voltages

To find the branch currents in the original circuit, that is, the currents
and 
in Fig. 4.62, we simply add the currents given by
Eqs. 4.87–4.90 to the currents given by Eqs. 4.80–4.82:

You should verify that the currents given by Eqs. 4.91–4.94 are the correct
values for the branch currents in the circuit shown in Fig. 4.62.
When applying superposition to linear circuits containing both independ-
ent and dependent sources, you must recognize that the dependent sources
are never deactivated. Example 4.13 illustrates the application of superposi-
tion when a circuit contains both dependent and independent sources.

Circuits with Realistic Resistors
It is not possible to fabricate identical electrical components. For example,
resistors produced from the same manufacturing process can vary in value
by as much as 
. Therefore, in creating an electrical system the designer
must consider the impact that component variation will have on the per-
formance of the system. One way to evaluate this impact is by performing
sensitivity analysis. Sensitivity analysis permits the designer to calculate
the impact of variations in the component values on the output of the sys-
tem. We will see how this information enables a designer to specify an
acceptable component value tolerance for each of the system’s components.
Consider the circuit shown in Fig. 4.69. To illustrate sensitivity analysis,
we will investigate the sensitivity of the node voltages 
and 
to changes
in the resistor 
. Using nodal analysis we can derive the expressions for 
and 
as functions of the circuit resistors and source currents. The results
are given in Eqs. 4.95 and 4.96:

How do we use the results given by Eqs. 4.101 and 4.102? Assume that

. Then
and Eq. 4.101 predicts

Therefore, if

(4.103)
Similarly for Eq. 4.102 we have

.
(4.104)
We attempt to confirm the results in Eqs. 4.103 and 4.104 by substituting
the value 
into Eqs. 4.95 and 4.96. When we do, the results are
,
(4.105)
.
(4.106)
Why is there a difference between the values predicted from the sensitivity
analysis and the exact values computed by substituting for 
in the equa-
tions for 
and 
? We can see from Eqs. 4.97 and 4.98 that the sensitivity
of 
and 
with respect to 
is a function of 
, because 
appears in
the denominator of both Eqs. 4.97 and 4.98. This means that as 
changes, the sensitivities change and hence we cannot expect Eqs. 4.97 and
4.98 to give exact results for large changes in 
Note that for a 
change in 
, the percent error between the predicted and exact values of
and 
is small. Specifically, the percent error in 
and the
percent error in

From this example, we can see that a tremendous amount of work is
involved if we are to determine the sensitivity of 
and 
to changes in
the remaining component values, namely 
, 
, 
, 
, and 
.
Fortunately, PSpice has a sensitivity function that will perform sensitivity
analysis for us. The sensitivity function in PSpice calculates two types of
sensitivity. The first is known as the one-unit sensitivity, and the second
is known as the 
sensitivity. In the example circuit, a one-unit change
in a resistor would change its value by 
and a one-unit change in a
current source would change its value by 
. In contrast, 
sensitiv-
ity analysis determines the effect of changing resistors or sources by
of their nominal values.
The result of PSpice sensitivity analysis of the circuit in Fig. 4.69 is
shown in Table 4.2. Because we are analyzing a linear circuit, we can use
superposition to predict values of 
and 
if more than one component’s
value changes. For example, let us assume 
decreases to 
and 
decreases to 
. From Table 4.2 we can combine the unit sensitivity of 
to changes in

In both cases our predictions are within a fraction of a volt of the actual node
voltage values.
Circuit designers use the results of sensitivity analysis to determine
which component value variation has the greatest impact on the output of
the circuit. As we can see from the PSpice sensitivity analysis in Table 4.2,
the node voltages 
and

9 times more sensitive to changes in

is
(6.5/0.5) or 13 times more sensitive to changes in

Summary
•
For the topics in this chapter,mastery of some basic terms,
and the concepts they represent, is necessary.Those terms
are node, essential node, path, branch, essential branch,
mesh, and planar circuit. Table 4.1 provides definitions
and examples of these terms. (See page 91.)
•
Two new circuit analysis techniques were introduced in
this chapter:
•
The node-voltage method works with both planar
and nonplanar circuits. A reference node is chosen
from among the essential nodes. Voltage variables
are assigned at the remaining essential nodes, and
Kirchhoff’s current law is used to write one equation
per voltage variable. The number of equations is
, where 
is the number of essential nodes.
(See page 93.)
•
The mesh-current method works only with planar
circuits. Mesh currents are assigned to each mesh,
and Kirchhoff’s voltage law is used to write one
equation per mesh. The number of equations is
, where b is the number of branches in
which the current is unknown, and n is the number of
nodes.The mesh currents are used to find the branch
currents. (See page 99.)
•
Several new circuit simplification techniques were
introduced in this chapter:
•
Source transformations allow us to exchange a volt-
age source (
) and a series resistor (R) for a current
source ( ) and a parallel resistor (R) and vice versa.
The combinations must be equivalent in terms of
their terminal voltage and current. Terminal equiva-
lence holds provided that

b - (n - 1)
ne
ne - 1
•
Thévenin equivalents and Norton equivalents allow
us to simplify a circuit comprised of sources and resis-
tors into an equivalent circuit consisting of a voltage
source and a series resistor (Thévenin) or a current
source and a parallel resistor (Norton).The simplified
circuit and the original circuit must be equivalent in
terms of their terminal voltage and current. Thus
keep in mind that (1) the Thévenin voltage (
) is
the open-circuit voltage across the terminals of the
original circuit, (2) the Thévenin resistance (
) is
the ratio of the Thévenin voltage to the short-circuit
current across the terminals of the original circuit;
and (3) the Norton equivalent is obtained by per-
forming a source transformation on a Thévenin
equivalent. (See page 113.)
•
Maximum power transfer is a technique for calculating
the maximum value of p that can be delivered to a load,
. Maximum power transfer occurs when 
,
the Thévenin resistance as seen from the resistor 
.
The equation for the maximum power transferred is
(See page 120.)
•
In a circuit with multiple independent sources,
superposition allows us to activate one source at a time
and sum the resulting voltages and currents to deter-
mine the voltages and currents that exist when all inde-
pendent sources are active. Dependent sources are
never deactivated when applying superposition. (See
page 122.)

The electronic circuit known as an operational amplifier has
become increasingly important. However, a detailed analysis of
this circuit requires an understanding of electronic devices such
as diodes and transistors. You may wonder, then, why we are
introducing the circuit before discussing the circuit’s electronic
components. There are several reasons. First, you can develop an
appreciation for how the operational amplifier can be used as a
circuit building block by focusing on its terminal behavior. At an
introductory level, you need not fully understand the operation
of the electronic components that govern terminal behavior.
Second, the circuit model of the operational amplifier requires
the use of a dependent source.Thus you have a chance to use this
type of source in a practical circuit rather than as an abstract cir-
cuit component. Third, you can combine the operational ampli-
fier with resistors to perform some very useful functions, such as
scaling, summing, sign changing, and subtracting. Finally, after
introducing inductors and capacitors in Chapter 6, we can show
you how to use the operational amplifier to design integrating
and differentiating circuits.
Our focus on the terminal behavior of the operational ampli-
fier implies taking a black box approach to its operation; that is,
we are not interested in the internal structure of the amplifier nor
in the currents and voltages that exist in this structure.The impor-
tant thing to remember is that the internal behavior of the ampli-
fier accounts for the voltage and current constraints imposed at
the terminals. (For now, we ask that you accept these constraints
on faith.)

How could you measure the amount of bending in a metal bar
such as the one shown in the figure without physically con-
tacting the bar? One method would be to use a strain gage. A
strain gage is a type of transducer. A transducer is a device
that measures a quantity by converting it into a more con-
venient form. The quantity we wish to measure in the metal
bar is the bending angle, but measuring the angle directly is
quite difficult and could even be dangerous. Instead, we
attach a strain gage (shown in the line drawing here) to the
metal bar. A strain gage is a grid of thin wires whose resist-
ance changes when the wires are lengthened or shortened:
where 
is the resistance of the gage at rest, 
is the
fractional lengthening of the gage (which is the definition of
“strain”), the constant 2 is typical of the manufacturer’s gage
factor, and 
is the change in resistance due to the bending
of the bar. Typically, pairs of strain gages are attached to
opposite sides of a bar. When the bar is bent, the wires in one
pair of gages get longer and thinner, increasing the resist-
ance, while the wires in the other pair of gages get shorter
and thicker, decreasing the resistance.
But how can the change in resistance be measured? One
way would be to use an ohmmeter. However, the change in
resistance experienced by the strain gage is typically much
smaller than could be accurately measured by an ohmmeter.
Usually the pairs of strain gages are connected to form a
Wheatstone bridge, and the voltage difference between two
legs of the bridge is measured. In order to make an accurate
measurement of the voltage difference, we use an operational
amplifier circuit to amplify, or increase, the voltage differ-
ence. After we introduce the operational amplifier and some
of the important circuits that employ these devices, we will
present the circuit used together with the strain gages for
measuring the amount of bending in a metal bar.
The operational amplifier circuit first came into existence
as a basic building block in analog computers. It was referred
to as operational because it was used to implement the math-
ematical operations of integration, differentiation, addition,
sign changing, and scaling. In recent years, the range of
application has broadened beyond implementing mathemati-
cal operations; however, the original name for the circuit per-
sists. Engineers and technicians have a penchant for creating
technical jargon; hence the operational amplifier is widely
known as the op amp.

Figure 5.1  The eight-lead DIP package (top view).
1 DIP is an abbreviation for dual in-line package. This means that the terminals on each side of
the package are in line, and that the terminals on opposite sides of the package also line up.
2 The common node is external to the op amp.It is the reference terminal of the circuit in which
the op amp is embedded.
5.1 Operational Amplifier Terminals
Because we are stressing the terminal behavior of the operational ampli-
fier (op amp), we begin by discussing the terminals on a commercially
available device. In 1968, Fairchild Semiconductor introduced an op amp
that has found widespread acceptance: the 
. (The 
prefix is used
by Fairchild to indicate a microcircuit fabrication of the amplifier.) This
amplifier is available in several different packages. For our discussion, we
assume an eight-lead DIP.1 Figure 5.1 shows a top view of the package,
with the terminal designations given alongside the terminals. The termi-
nals of primary interest are
•
inverting input,
•
noninverting input,
•
output,
•
positive power supply (
),
•
negative power supply (
).
The remaining three terminals are of little or no concern.The offset null ter-
minals may be used in an auxiliary circuit to compensate for a degradation
in performance because of aging and imperfections. However, the degrada-
tion in most cases is negligible, so the offset terminals often are unused and
play a secondary role in circuit analysis. Terminal 8 is of no interest simply
because it is an unused terminal; NC stands for no connection, which means
that the terminal is not connected to the amplifier circuit.
Figure 5.2 shows a widely used circuit symbol for an op amp that con-
tains the five terminals of primary interest. Using word labels for the ter-
minals is inconvenient in circuit diagrams, so we simplify the terminal
designations in the following way. The noninverting input terminal is
labeled plus (
), and the inverting input terminal is labeled minus (
).
The power supply terminals, which are always drawn outside the triangle,
are marked 
and 
The terminal at the apex of the triangular box is
always understood to be the output terminal. Figure 5.3 summarizes these
simplified designations.
5.2 Terminal Voltages and Currents
We are now ready to introduce the terminal voltages and currents used to
describe the behavior of the op amp. The voltage variables are measured
from a common reference node.2 Figure 5.4 shows the voltage variables
with their reference polarities.

Terminal Voltages and Currents

Figure 5.5 shows the current variables with their reference directions.
Note that all the current reference directions are into the terminals of the
operational amplifier:
is the current into the inverting input terminal;
is the current into the noninverting input terminal;
is the current into
the output terminal;
is the current into the positive power supply termi-
nal; and 
is the current into the negative power supply terminal.
The terminal behavior of the op amp as a linear circuit element is
characterized by constraints on the input voltages and the input currents.
The voltage constraint is derived from the voltage transfer characteristic
of the op amp integrated circuit and is pictured in Fig. 5.6.
The voltage transfer characteristic describes how the output voltage
varies as a function of the input voltages; that is, how voltage is transferred
from the input to the output. Note that for the op amp, the output voltage
is a function of the difference between the input voltages,
The
equation for the voltage transfer characteristic is
(5.1)
We see from Fig. 5.6 and Eq. 5.1 that the op amp has three distinct
regions of operation. When the magnitude of the input voltage difference
(
) is small, the op amp behaves as a linear device, as the output
voltage is a linear function of the input voltages. Outside this linear region,
the output of the op amp saturates, and the op amp behaves as a nonlinear
device, because the output voltage is no longer a linear function of the
input voltages.When it is operating linearly, the op amp’s output voltage is
equal to the difference in its input voltages times the multiplying constant,
or gain, A.
When we confine the op amp to its linear operating region, a con-
straint is imposed on the input voltages,
and 
The constraint is based
on typical numerical values for 
and A in Eq. 5.1. For most op amps, the
recommended dc power supply voltages seldom exceed 20 V,and the gain,A,
is rarely less than 
or 
We see from both Fig. 5.6 and Eq. 5.1
that in the linear region, the magnitude of the input voltage difference
(
) must be less than 
or 2 mV.
Typically, node voltages in the circuits we study are much larger than
2 mV, so a voltage difference of less than 2 mV means the two voltages are
essentially equal.Thus, when an op amp is constrained to its linear operat-
ing region and the node voltages are much larger than 2 mV, the constraint
on the input voltages of the op amp is
(5.2)
Note that Eq. 5.2 characterizes the relationship between the input voltages
for an ideal op amp; that is, an op amp whose value of A is infinite.
The input voltage constraint in Eq. 5.2 is called the virtual short
condition at the input of the op amp. It is natural to ask how the virtual
short is maintained at the input of the op amp when the op amp is
embedded in a circuit, thus ensuring linear operation.The answer is that
a signal is fed back from the output terminal to the inverting input ter-
minal. This configuration is known as negative feedback because the

The Operational Amplifier
signal fed back from the output subtracts from the input signal. The
negative feedback causes the input voltage difference to decrease.
Because the output voltage is proportional to the input voltage differ-
ence, the output voltage is also decreased, and the op amp operates in
its linear region.
If a circuit containing an op amp does not provide a negative feedback
path from the op amp output to the inverting input, then the op amp will
normally saturate. The difference in the input signals must be extremely
small to prevent saturation with no negative feedback. But even if the cir-
cuit provides a negative feedback path for the op amp, linear operation is
not ensured. So how do we know whether the op amp is operating in its
linear region?
The answer is, we don’t! We deal with this dilemma by assuming 
linear operation, performing the circuit analysis, and then checking our
results for contradictions. For example, suppose we assume that an 
op amp in a circuit is operating in its linear region, and we compute the
output voltage of the op amp to be 10 V. On examining the circuit, we
discover that 
is 6 V, resulting in a contradiction, because the 
op amp’s output voltage can be no larger than 
Thus our assump-
tion of linear operation was invalid, and the op amp output must be
saturated at 6 V.
We have identified a constraint on the input voltages that is based on
the voltage transfer characteristic of the op amp integrated circuit, the
assumption that the op amp is restricted to its linear operating region and
to typical values for 
and A. Equation 5.2 represents the voltage con-
straint for an ideal op amp, that is, with a value of A that is infinite.
We now turn our attention to the constraint on the input currents.
Analysis of the op amp integrated circuit reveals that the equivalent resist-
ance seen by the input terminals of the op amp is very large, typically 
or more. Ideally, the equivalent input resistance is infinite, resulting in the
current constraint
(5.3)
Note that the current constraint is not based on assuming the op amp is
confined to its linear operating region as was the voltage constraint.
Together, Eqs. 5.2 and 5.3 form the constraints on terminal behavior that
define our ideal op amp model.
From Kirchhoff’s current law we know that the sum of the currents
entering the operational amplifier is zero, or
(5.4)
Substituting the constraint given by Eq. 5.3 into Eq. 5.4 gives
(5.5)
The significance of Eq. 5.5 is that, even though the current at the input
terminals is negligible, there may still be appreciable current at the out-
put terminal.
Before we start analyzing circuits containing op amps, let’s further sim-
plify the circuit symbol.When we know that the amplifier is operating within
its linear region, the dc voltages
do not enter into the circuit equations.

In this case, we can remove the power supply terminals from the symbol
and the dc power supplies from the circuit, as shown in Fig. 5.7. A word of

danger of inferring from the symbol that

is not constant under all operating conditions. For now, however, we
assume that it is. A discussion of how and why the value of A can change
must be delayed until after you have studied the electronic devices and
components used to fabricate an amplifier.
Example 5.1 illustrates the judicious application of Eqs. 5.2 and 5.3.
When we use these equations to predict the behavior of a circuit contain-
ing an op amp, in effect we are using an ideal model of the device.

a node-voltage equation at the inverting input
terminal.The voltage at the inverting input termi-

5.3 The Inverting-Amplifier Circuit
We are now ready to discuss the operation of some important op amp circuits,
using Eqs. 5.2 and 5.3 to model the behavior of the device itself. Figure 5.9
shows an inverting-amplifier circuit.We assume that the op amp is operating
in its linear region. Note that, in addition to the op amp, the circuit consists of
two resistors (
and 
), a voltage signal source (
), and a short circuit con-
nected between the noninverting input terminal and the common node.
We now analyze this circuit, assuming an ideal op amp. The goal is to
obtain an expression for the output voltage,
as a function of the source
voltage,
We employ a single node-voltage equation at the inverting ter-
minal of the op amp, given as

Example 5.2
Designing an Inverting Amplifier
Note that the output voltage is an inverted, scaled replica of the input. The
sign reversal from input to output is, of course, the reason for referring to the
circuit as an inverting amplifier.The scaling factor,or gain,is the ratio 
The result given by Eq. 5.10 is valid only if the op amp shown in the
circuit in Fig. 5.9 is ideal; that is, if A is infinite and the input resistance is
infinite. For a practical op amp, Eq. 5.10 is an approximation, usually a
good one. (We say more about this later.) Equation 5.10 is important
because it tells us that if the op amp gain A is large, we can specify the gain
of the inverting amplifier with the external resistors 
and 
The upper
limit on the gain,
is determined by the power supply voltages and
the value of the signal voltage 
If we assume equal power supply voltages,
that is,
we get
(5.11)
For example, if 
and 
the ratio 
must be less
than 1500.
In the inverting amplifier circuit shown in Fig. 5.9, the resistor 
pro-
vides the negative feedback connection.That is, it connects the output ter-
minal to the inverting input terminal. If 
is removed, the feedback path
is opened and the amplifier is said to be operating open loop. Figure 5.10
shows the open-loop operation.
Opening the feedback path drastically changes the behavior of the
circuit. First, the output voltage is now

for linear
operation. Because the inverting input current is almost zero, the voltage
drop across 
is almost zero, and the inverting input voltage nearly equals
the signal voltage,
that is,
Hence, the op amp can operate open
loop in the linear mode only if 
If 
the op amp
simply saturates. In particular, if 
the op amp saturates at

the op amp saturates at 
Because the
relationship shown in Eq. 5.12 occurs when there is no feedback path, the
value of A is often called the open-loop gain of the op amp.

ing amplifier using realistic resistor values.

Although we illustrated the summing amplifier with just three input
signals,the number of input voltages can be increased as needed.For exam-
ple, you might wish to sum 16 individually recorded audio signals to form a
single audio signal.The summing amplifier configuration in Fig. 5.12 could
include 16 different input resistor values so that each of the input audio
tracks appears in the output signal with a different amplification factor.
The summing amplifier thus plays the role of an audio mixer. As with
inverting-amplifier circuits, the scaling factors in summing-amplifier cir-
cuits are determined by the external resistors Rf, Ra, Rb, Rc, . . . , Rn .

5.6 The Difference-Amplifier Circuit
The output voltage of a difference amplifier is proportional to the difference
between the two input voltages. To demonstrate, we analyze the difference-
amplifier circuit shown in Fig.5.15,assuming an ideal op amp operating in its
linear region.We derive the relationship between 
and the two input volt-
ages 
and 
by summing the currents away from the inverting input node:
(5.19)
Because the op amp is ideal, we use the voltage and current constraints to
see that
(5.20)
(5.21)
Combining Eqs. 5.19, 5.20, and 5.21 gives the desired relationship:
(5.22)
Equation 5.22 shows that the output voltage is proportional to the dif-
ference between a scaled replica of 
and a scaled replica of 
In general
the scaling factor applied to 
is not the same as that applied to 
However, the scaling factor applied to each input voltage can be made
equal by setting
(5.23)
When Eq. 5.23 is satisfied, the expression for the output voltage reduces to
(5.24)
Equation 5.24 indicates that the output voltage can be made a scaled
replica of the difference between the input voltages 
and 
As in the
previous ideal amplifier circuits, the scaling is controlled by the external
resistors. Furthermore, the relationship between the output voltage and
the input voltages is not affected by connecting a nonzero load resistance
across the output of the amplifier.

istic resistor values.

The Difference Amplifier—Another Perspective
We can examine the behavior of a difference amplifier more closely if we
redefine its inputs in terms of two other voltages. The first is the
differential mode input, which is the difference between the two input
voltages in Fig. 5.15:
(5.25)

input voltages in Fig. 5.15:

The Difference-Amplifier Circuit

Using Eqs. 5.25 and 5.26, we can now represent the original input voltages,
and 
in terms of the differential mode and common mode voltages,
and 
:
(5.27)
(5.28)
Substituting Eqs. 5.27 and 5.28 into Eq. 5.22 gives the output of the differ-
ence amplifier in terms of the differential mode and common mode voltages:

(5.30)
where

is the differential mode

that satisfy Eq. 5.23, into Eq. 5.29:
(5.31)
Thus, an ideal difference amplifier has 
amplifies only the differ-
ential mode portion of the input voltage, and eliminates the common
mode portion of the input voltage. Figure 5.17 shows a difference-
amplifier circuit with differential mode and common mode input voltages
in place of 
and 
Equation 5.30 provides an important perspective on the function of the
difference amplifier, since in many applications it is the differential mode
signal that contains the information of interest, whereas the common mode
signal is the noise found in all electric signals.For example,an electrocardio-
graph electrode measures the voltages produced by your body to regulate
your heartbeat. These voltages have very small magnitudes compared with
the electrical noise that the electrode picks up from sources such as lights
and electrical equipment. The noise appears as the common mode portion
of the measured voltage, whereas the heart rate voltages comprise the dif-
ferential mode portion. Thus an ideal difference amplifier would amplify
only the voltage of interest and would suppress the noise.
Measuring Difference-Amplifier Performance—
The Common Mode Rejection Ratio
An ideal difference amplifier has zero common mode gain and nonzero
(and usually large) differential mode gain. Two factors have an influence
on the ideal common mode gain—resistance mismatches (that is, Eq. [5.23]
is not satisfied) or a nonideal op amp (that is, Eq. [5.20] is not satisfied).We
focus here on the effect of resistance mismatches on the performance of a
difference amplifier.

Suppose that resistor values are chosen that do not precisely satisfy
Eq. 5.23. Instead, the relationship among the resistors 
and 
is
so
(5.32)
or
(5.33)
where 
is a very small number. We can see the effect of this resistance
mismatch on the common mode gain of the difference amplifier by substi-
tuting Eq. 5.33 into Eq. 5.29 and simplifying the expression for 
:
(5.34)
(5.35)
(5.36)
We can make the approximation to give Eq. 5.36 because 
is very small,
and therefore 
is approximately 1 in the denominator of Eq. 5.35.
Note that, when the resistors in the difference amplifier satisfy Eq. 5.23,
and Eq. 5.36 gives 
Now calculate the effect of the resistance mismatch on the differential
mode gain by substituting Eq. 5.33 into Eq. 5.29 and simplifying the
expression for 
:
(5.37)
(5.38)
(5.39)
We use the same rationale for the approximation in Eq. 5.39 as in the com-
putation of 
When the resistors in the difference amplifier satisfy
Eq. 5.23,
and Eq. 5.39 gives 
The common mode rejection ratio (CMRR) can be used to measure
how nearly ideal a difference amplifier is. It is defined as the ratio of the
differential mode gain to the common mode gain:

5.7
A More Realistic Model for the Operational Amplifier
159
The higher the CMRR, the more nearly ideal the difference amplifier.We
can see the effect of resistance mismatch on the CMRR by substituting
Eqs. 5.36 and 5.39 into Eq. 5.40:
(5.41)
(5.42)
(5.43)
From Eq. 5.43, if the resistors in the difference amplifier are matched,
and 
Even if the resistors are mismatched, we can
minimize the impact of the mismatch by making the differential mode
gain (
) very large, thereby making the CMRR large.
We said at the outset that another reason for nonzero common mode
gain is a nonideal op amp. Note that the op amp is itself a difference
amplifier, because in the linear operating region, its output is proportional
to the difference of its inputs; that is,
The output of a
nonideal op amp is not strictly proportional to the difference between the
inputs (the differential mode input) but also is comprised of a common
mode signal. Internal mismatches in the components of the integrated cir-
cuit make the behavior of the op amp nonideal, in the same way that the
resistor mismatches in the difference-amplifier circuit make its behavior
nonideal. Even though a discussion of nonideal op amps is beyond the
scope of this text, you may note that the CMRR is often used in assessing
how nearly ideal an op amp’s behavior is. In fact, it is one of the main ways
of rating op amps in practice.
NOTE: Assess your understanding of this material by trying Chapter
Problems 5.33 and 5.34.
5.7 A More Realistic Model for the
Operational Amplifier
We now consider a more realistic model that predicts the performance of
an op amp in its linear region of operation. Such a model includes three
modifications to the ideal op amp: (1) a finite input resistance,
(2) a
finite open-loop gain, A; and (3) a nonzero output resistance,
The cir-
cuit shown in Fig. 5.18 illustrates the more realistic model.
Whenever we use the equivalent circuit shown in Fig. 5.18, we disre-
gard the assumptions that 
(Eq. 5.2) and 
(Eq. 5.3).
Furthermore, Eq. 5.1 is no longer valid because of the presence of the
nonzero output resistance,
Another way to understand the circuit
shown in Fig. 5.18 is to reverse our thought process.That is, we can see that
the circuit reduces to the ideal model when 
and 
For the 
op amp, the typical values of 
and 
are 
and 
respectively.
Although the presence of 
and 
makes the analysis of circuits con-
taining op amps more cumbersome, such analysis remains straightforward.

using the equivalent circuit shown in Fig. 5.18.We begin with the invert-

Analysis of an Inverting-Amplifier Circuit Using 
the More Realistic Op Amp Model
If we use the op amp circuit shown in Fig. 5.18, the circuit for the inverting
amplifier is the one depicted in Fig. 5.19. As before, our goal is to express
the output voltage,
as a function of the source voltage,
We obtain
the desired expression by writing the two node-voltage equations that
describe the circuit and then solving the resulting set of equations for 
In Fig. 5.19, the two nodes are labeled a and b. Also note that 
by

terminals with a load resistance of 
ohms, the relationship between

would become

Practical Perspective
Strain Gages
Changes in the shape of elastic solids are of great importance to engineers
who design structures that twist, stretch, or bend when subjected to exter-
nal forces. An aircraft frame is a prime example of a structure in which engi-
neers must take into consideration elastic strain. The intelligent application
of strain gages requires information about the physical structure of the
gage, methods of bonding the gage to the surface of the structure, and the
orientation of the gage relative to the forces exerted on the structure. Our
purpose here is to point out that strain gage measurements are important in
engineering applications, and a knowledge of electric circuits is germane to
their proper use.
The circuit shown in Fig. 5.21 provides one way to measure the change
in resistance experienced by strain gages in applications like the one

shortened have the values 
We will analyze this circuit to discover
the relationship between the output voltage, 
and the change in resist-
ance, 
experienced by the strain gages.
To begin, assume that the op amp is ideal. Writing the KCL equations at
the inverting and noninverting input terminals of the op amp we see
(5.57)
(5.58)
Now rearrange Eq. 5.58 to get an expression for the voltage at the nonin-
verting terminal of the op amp:
(5.59)
As usual, we will assume that the op amp is operating in its linear region, so
and the expression for 
in Eq. 5.59 must also be the expression
for 
. We can thus substitute the right-hand side of Eq. 5.59 in place of 
in Eq. 5.57 and solve for 
. After some algebraic manipulation,
(5.60)
Because the change in resistance experienced by strain gages is very small,
so 
and Eq. 5.60 becomes

The Operational Amplifier
Summary
•
The equation that defines the voltage transfer charac-
teristic of an ideal op amp is
where A is a proportionality constant known as the
open-loop gain, and 
represents the power supply
voltages. (See page 147.)
•
A feedback path between an op amp’s output and 
its inverting input can constrain the op amp to its 
linear operating region where 
. (See
page 147.)
•
A voltage constraint exists when the op amp is con-
fined to its linear operating region due to typical val-
ues of 
and A. If the ideal modeling assumptions
are made—meaning A is assumed to be infinite—the
ideal op amp model is characterized by the volt-
age constraint
(See page 147.)
•
A current constraint further characterizes the ideal 
op amp model, because the ideal input resistance of 
the op amp integrated circuit is infinite. This current
constraint is given by
(See page 148.)
•
We considered both a simple, ideal op amp model and a
more realistic model in this chapter. The differences
between the two models are as follows:
Simplified Model
More Realistic Model
Infinite input resistance
Finite input resistance
Infinite open-loop gain
Finite open-loop gain
Zero output resistance
Nonzero output resistance

An inverting amplifier is an op amp circuit producing
an output voltage that is an inverted, scaled replica of
the input. (See page 150.)
•
A summing amplifier is an op amp circuit producing an
output voltage that is a scaled sum of the input voltages.
(See page 152.)
•
A noninverting amplifier is an op amp circuit producing
an output voltage that is a scaled replica of the input
voltage. (See page 153.)
•
A difference amplifier is an op amp circuit producing an
output voltage that is a scaled replica of the input volt-
age difference. (See page 155.)
•
The two voltage inputs to a difference amplifier can be
used to calculate the common mode and difference
mode voltage inputs,
and 
. The output from the
difference amplifier can be written in the form
where 
is the common mode gain, and 
is the
differential mode gain. (See page 157.)
•
In an ideal difference amplifier,
To measure
how nearly ideal a difference amplifier is, we use the
common mode rejection ratio:
An ideal difference amplifier has an infinite CMRR.

We begin this chapter by introducing the last two ideal circuit
elements mentioned in Chapter 2, namely, inductors and capaci-
tors. Be assured that the circuit analysis techniques introduced in
Chapters 3 and 4 apply to circuits containing inductors and capac-
itors. Therefore, once you understand the terminal behavior of
these elements in terms of current and voltage, you can use
Kirchhoff’s laws to describe any interconnections with the other
basic elements. Like other components, inductors and capacitors
are easier to describe in terms of circuit variables rather than
electromagnetic field variables. However, before we focus on the
circuit descriptions, a brief review of the field concepts under-
lying these basic elements is in order.
An inductor is an electrical component that opposes any
change in electrical current. It is composed of a coil of wire
wound around a supporting core whose material may be mag-
netic or nonmagnetic. The behavior of inductors is based on phe-
nomena associated with magnetic fields. The source of the
magnetic field is charge in motion, or current. If the current is
varying with time, the magnetic field is varying with time.A time-
varying magnetic field induces a voltage in any conductor linked
by the field. The circuit parameter of inductance relates the
induced voltage to the current. We discuss this quantitative rela-
tionship in Section 6.1.
A capacitor is an electrical component that consists of two
conductors separated by an insulator or dielectric material. The
capacitor is the only device other than a battery that can store
electrical charge.The behavior of capacitors is based on phenom-
ena associated with electric fields. The source of the electric field
is separation of charge, or voltage. If the voltage is varying with
time, the electric field is varying with time.A time-varying electric
field produces a displacement current in the space occupied by
the field. The circuit parameter of capacitance relates the dis-
placement current to the voltage, where the displacement current
is equal to the conduction current at the terminals of the capaci-
tor. We discuss this quantitative relationship in Section 6.2.

The Practical Perspective in Chapter 3 showed how a grid of
resistors is used to create a touch screen for a phone or com-
puter monitor. But resistive touch screens have some limita-
tions, the most important of which is that the screen can 
only process a single touch at any instant in time (see
Problem 3.75). For example, a resistive touch screen cannot
process the “pinch” gesture used by many devices to enlarge
or shrink the image on the screen.
Multi-touch screens use a different component within 
a grid below the screen – capacitors. As you are about to 
discover in this chapter, a capacitor is a circuit element whose
terminal characteristics are determined by electric fields.
When you touch a capacitive touch screen, you produce a
change in the value of a capacitor, causing a voltage change.
Once you have learned the basic behavior of capacitors and
have learned how they combine in series and in parallel, we
will present two possible designs for a multi-touch screen
using a grid of capacitors. These designs are presented in the
Practical Perspective example at the end of this chapter.

Inductance, Capacitance, and Mutual Inductance
6.1 The Inductor
Inductance is the circuit parameter used to describe an inductor.Inductance
is symbolized by the letter L, is measured in henrys (H), and is represented
graphically as a coiled wire—a reminder that inductance is a consequence
of a conductor linking a magnetic field. Figure 6.1(a) shows an inductor.
Assigning the reference direction of the current in the direction of the volt-
age drop across the terminals of the inductor, as shown in Fig. 6.1(b), yields
(6.1)
where 
is measured in volts, L in henrys, i in amperes, and t in seconds.
Equation 6.1 reflects the passive sign convention shown in Fig. 6.1(b); that
is, the current reference is in the direction of the voltage drop across the
inductor. If the current reference is in the direction of the voltage rise,
Eq. 6.1 is written with a minus sign.
Note from Eq. 6.1 that the voltage across the terminals of an inductor
is proportional to the time rate of change of the current in the inductor.
We can make two important observations here. First, if the current is con-
stant, the voltage across the ideal inductor is zero. Thus the inductor
behaves as a short circuit in the presence of a constant, or dc, current.
Second, current cannot change instantaneously in an inductor; that is, the
current cannot change by a finite amount in zero time. Equation 6.1 tells
us that this change would require an infinite voltage, and infinite voltages
are not possible. For example, when someone opens the switch on an
inductive circuit in an actual system, the current initially continues to flow
in the air across the switch, a phenomenon called arcing. The arc across
the switch prevents the current from dropping to zero instantaneously.
Switching inductive circuits is an important engineering problem, because
arcing and voltage surges must be controlled to prevent equipment dam-
age.The first step to understanding the nature of this problem is to master
the introductory material presented in this and the following two chapters.
Example 6.1 illustrates the application of Eq. 6.1 to a simple circuit.

Section 6.3 describes techniques used to simplify circuits with series or
parallel combinations of capacitors or inductors.
Energy can be stored in both magnetic and electric fields. Hence you
should not be too surprised to learn that inductors and capacitors are
capable of storing energy. For example, energy can be stored in an induc-
tor and then released to fire a spark plug. Energy can be stored in a capac-
itor and then released to fire a flashbulb. In ideal inductors and capacitors,
only as much energy can be extracted as has been stored. Because induc-
tors and capacitors cannot generate energy, they are classified as passive
elements.
In Sections 6.4 and 6.5 we consider the situation in which two circuits
are linked by a magnetic field and thus are said to be magnetically cou-
pled. In this case, the voltage induced in the second circuit can be related
to the time-varying current in the first circuit by a parameter known as
mutual inductance. The practical significance of magnetic coupling
unfolds as we study the relationships between current, voltage, power, and
several new parameters specific to mutual inductance.We introduce these
relationships here and then describe their utility in a device called a trans-
former in Chapters 9 and 10.

Current in an Inductor in Terms of the Voltage
Across the Inductor
Equation 6.1 expresses the voltage across the terminals of an inductor as a
function of the current in the inductor. Also desirable is the ability to
express the current as a function of the voltage.To find i as a function of ,
we start by multiplying both sides of Eq. 6.1 by a differential time dt:
(6.2)
Multiplying the rate at which i varies with t by a differential change in time
generates a differential change in i, so we write Eq. 6.2 as

We next integrate both sides of Eq. 6.3. For convenience, we interchange

become limits on the integrals.Then, from Eq. 6.4,

Equations 6.1 and 6.5 both give the relationship between the voltage
and current at the terminals of an inductor. Equation 6.1 expresses the
voltage as a function of current, whereas Eq. 6.5 expresses the current as a
function of voltage. In both equations the reference direction for the cur-
rent is in the direction of the voltage drop across the terminals. Note that
carries its own algebraic sign. If the initial current is in the same direc-
tion as the reference direction for i, it is a positive quantity. If the initial
current is in the opposite direction, it is a negative quantity. Example 6.2

Note in Example 6.2 that i approaches a constant value of 2 A as t
increases.We say more about this result after discussing the energy stored
in an inductor.
Power and Energy in the Inductor
The power and energy relationships for an inductor can be derived
directly from the current and voltage relationships. If the current refer-
ence is in the direction of the voltage drop across the terminals of the
inductor, the power is
(6.7)
Remember that power is in watts, voltage is in volts, and current is in
amperes. If we express the inductor voltage as a function of the inductor
current, Eq. 6.7 becomes
(6.8)
We can also express the current in terms of the voltage:
(6.9)
Equation 6.8 is useful in expressing the energy stored in the inductor.
Power is the time rate of expending energy, so
(6.10)
Multiplying both sides of Eq. 6.10 by a differential time gives the differen-
tial relationship
(6.11)
Both sides of Eq. 6.11 are integrated with the understanding that the ref-
erence for zero energy corresponds to zero current in the inductor.Thus

As before, we use different symbols of integration to avoid confusion
with the limits placed on the integrals. In Eq. 6.12, the energy is in joules,
inductance is in henrys, and current is in amperes. To illustrate the appli-
cation of Eqs. 6.7 and 6.12, we return to Examples 6.1 and 6.2 by means of
Example 6.3.

6.1
The Inductor
181
Based on the definition of p, the area under
the plot of p versus t represents the energy
expended over the interval of integration.
Hence the integration of the power between
0 and 0.2 s represents the energy stored in the
inductor during this time interval. The integral
of p over the interval 
is the energy
extracted. Note that in this time interval, all
the energy originally stored is removed; that is,
after the current peak has passed, no energy is
stored in the inductor.
f) The plots of , i, p, and 
follow directly from
the expressions for 
and i given in Example 6.2
and are shown in Fig. 6.9. Note that in this case
the power is always positive, and hence energy
is always being stored during the voltage pulse.

g) The application of the voltage pulse stores
energy in the inductor. Because the inductor is
ideal, this energy cannot dissipate after the volt-
age subsides to zero. Therefore, a sustained cur-
rent circulates in the circuit. A lossless inductor
obviously is an ideal circuit element. Practical
inductors require a resistor in the circuit model.

6.2 The Capacitor
The circuit parameter of capacitance is represented by the letter C, is
measured in farads (F), and is symbolized graphically by two short paral-
lel conductive plates, as shown in Fig. 6.10(a). Because the farad is an
extremely large quantity of capacitance, practical capacitor values usually
lie in the picofarad (pF) to microfarad 
range.
The graphic symbol for a capacitor is a reminder that capacitance
occurs whenever electrical conductors are separated by a dielectric, or
insulating, material. This condition implies that electric charge is not
transported through the capacitor. Although applying a voltage to the
terminals of the capacitor cannot move a charge through the dielectric, it
can displace a charge within the dielectric. As the voltage varies with
time, the displacement of charge also varies with time, causing what is
known as the displacement current.
At the terminals, the displacement current is indistinguishable from a
conduction current. The current is proportional to the rate at which the
voltage across the capacitor varies with time, or, mathematically,
(6.13)
where i is measured in amperes, C in farads,
in volts, and t in seconds.
Equation 6.13 reflects the passive sign convention shown in Fig.6.10(b);
that is,the current reference is in the direction of the voltage drop across the
capacitor. If the current reference is in the direction of the voltage rise,
Eq. 6.13 is written with a minus sign.

The Capacitor
183
 Capacitor power equation
Two important observations follow from Eq. 6.13. First, voltage cannot
change instantaneously across the terminals of a capacitor. Equation 6.13
indicates that such a change would produce infinite current, a physical
impossibility. Second, if the voltage across the terminals is constant, the
capacitor current is zero.The reason is that a conduction current cannot be
established in the dielectric material of the capacitor. Only a time-varying
voltage can produce a displacement current.Thus a capacitor behaves as an
open circuit in the presence of a constant voltage.
Equation 6.13 gives the capacitor current as a function of the capaci-
tor voltage. Expressing the voltage as a function of the current is also use-
ful. To do so, we multiply both sides of Eq. 6.13 by a differential time dt
and then integrate the resulting differentials:
Carrying out the integration of the left-hand side of the second equa-
tion gives
(6.14)
In many practical applications of Eq. 6.14, the initial time is zero; that is,
Thus Eq. 6.14 becomes

6.3 Series-Parallel Combinations 
of Inductance and Capacitance
Just as series-parallel combinations of resistors can be reduced to a single
equivalent resistor, series-parallel combinations of inductors or capacitors
can be reduced to a single inductor or capacitor. Figure 6.13 shows induc-
tors in series. Here, the inductors are forced to carry the same current; thus
we define only one current for the series combination. The voltage drops
across the individual inductors are
The voltage across the series connection is
from which it should be apparent that the equivalent inductance of series-
connected inductors is the sum of the individual inductances. For n induc-
tors in series,
(6.19)
If the original inductors carry an initial current of 
the equivalent
inductor carries the same initial current. Figure 6.14 shows the equivalent
circuit for series inductors carrying an initial current.
Inductors in parallel have the same terminal voltage. In the equivalent
circuit, the current in each inductor is a function of the terminal voltage
and the initial current in the inductor. For the three inductors in parallel
shown in Fig. 6.15, the currents for the individual inductors are
(6.20)
The current at the terminals of the three parallel inductors is the sum of
the inductor currents:

Inductance, Capacitance, and Mutual Inductance
Now we can interpret Eq. 6.22 in terms of a single inductor; that is,
(6.23)
Comparing Eq. 6.23 with (6.22) yields
(6.24)
(6.25)
Figure 6.16 shows the equivalent circuit for the three parallel inductors in
Fig. 6.15.
The results expressed in Eqs. 6.24 and 6.25 can be extended to
n inductors in parallel:
(6.26)
(6.27)
Capacitors connected in series can be reduced to a single equivalent
capacitor.The reciprocal of the equivalent capacitance is equal to the sum
of the reciprocals of the individual capacitances. If each capacitor carries
its own initial voltage, the initial voltage on the equivalent capacitor is the
algebraic sum of the initial voltages on the individual capacitors. Figure 6.17
and the following equations summarize these observations:
(6.28)
(6.29)
We leave the derivation of the equivalent circuit for series-connected
capacitors as an exercise. (See Problem 6.32.)
The equivalent capacitance of capacitors connected in parallel is sim-
ply the sum of the capacitances of the individual capacitors, as Fig. 6.18
and the following equation show:
(6.30)
Capacitors connected in parallel must carry the same voltage.Therefore, if
there is an initial voltage across the original parallel capacitors, this same
initial voltage appears across the equivalent capacitance 
The deriva-
tion of the equivalent circuit for parallel capacitors is left as an exercise.
(See Problem 6.33.)
We say more about series-parallel equivalent circuits of inductors and
capacitors in Chapter 7, where we interpret results based on their use.

6.4 Mutual Inductance
The magnetic field we considered in our study of inductors in Section 6.1
was restricted to a single circuit. We said that inductance is the parameter
that relates a voltage to a time-varying current in the same circuit; thus,
inductance is more precisely referred to as self-inductance.
We now consider the situation in which two circuits are linked by a
magnetic field. In this case, the voltage induced in the second circuit can
be related to the time-varying current in the first circuit by a parameter

known as mutual inductance.The circuit shown in Fig. 6.19 represents two
magnetically coupled coils. The self-inductances of the two coils are
labeled 
and 
and the mutual inductance is labeled M. The double-
headed arrow adjacent to M indicates the pair of coils with this value of
mutual inductance.This notation is needed particularly in circuits contain-
ing more than one pair of magnetically coupled coils.
The easiest way to analyze circuits containing mutual inductance is
to use mesh currents. The problem is to write the circuit equations that
describe the circuit in terms of the coil currents. First, choose the refer-
ence direction for each coil current. Figure 6.20 shows arbitrarily
selected reference currents. After choosing the reference directions for
and 
sum the voltages around each closed path. Because of the
mutual inductance M, there will be two voltages across each coil,
namely, a self-induced voltage and a mutually induced voltage. The self-
induced voltage is the product of the self-inductance of the coil and the
first derivative of the current in that coil. The mutually induced voltage
is the product of the mutual inductance of the coils and the first deriva-
tive of the current in the other coil. Consider the coil on the left in 
Fig. 6.20 whose self-inductance has the value 
The self-induced 
voltage across this coil is 
and the mutually induced voltage
across this coil is 
. But what about the polarities of these 
two voltages?
Using the passive sign convention, the self-induced voltage is a voltage
drop in the direction of the current producing the voltage. But the polarity
of the mutually induced voltage depends on the way the coils are wound in
relation to the reference direction of coil currents. In general, showing the
details of mutually coupled windings is very cumbersome. Instead, we keep
track of the polarities by a method known as the dot convention, in which a
dot is placed on one terminal of each winding, as shown in Fig. 6.21. These
dots carry the sign information and allow us to draw the coils schematically
rather than showing how they wrap around a core structure.
The rule for using the dot convention to determine the polarity of
mutually induced voltage can be summarized as follows:
When the reference direction for a current enters the dotted termi-
nal of a coil, the reference polarity of the voltage that it induces in
the other coil is positive at its dotted terminal.
Or, stated alternatively,
When the reference direction for a current leaves the dotted termi-
nal of a coil, the reference polarity of the voltage that it induces in
the other coil is negative at its dotted terminal.
For the most part, dot markings will be provided for you in the circuit
diagrams in this text. The important skill is to be able to write the appro-
priate circuit equations given your understanding of mutual inductance
and the dot convention. Figuring out where to place the polarity dots if
they are not given may be possible by examining the physical configura-
tion of an actual circuit or by testing it in the laboratory. We will discuss
these procedures after we discuss the use of dot markings.
In Fig. 6.21, the dot convention rule indicates that the reference polar-
ity for the voltage induced in coil 1 by the current 
is negative at the dot-
ted terminal of coil 1.This voltage 
is a voltage rise with respect
to 
The voltage induced in coil 2 by the current 
is 
and its ref-
erence polarity is positive at the dotted terminal of coil 2.This voltage is a
voltage rise in the direction of

induced voltages across coils 1 and 2 along with their polarity marks.

The Procedure for Determining Dot Markings
We shift now to two methods of determining dot markings. The first
assumes that we know the physical arrangement of the two coils and the
mode of each winding in a magnetically coupled circuit. The following six
steps, applied here to Fig. 6.23, determine a set of dot markings:
a) Arbitrarily select one terminal—say, the D terminal—of one coil and
mark it with a dot.
b) Assign a current into the dotted terminal and label it 
c) Use the right-hand rule1 to determine the direction of the magnetic
field established by 
inside the coupled coils and label this field 
.
d) Arbitrarily pick one terminal of the second coil—say, terminal A—and
assign a current into this terminal, showing the current as 
e) Use the right-hand rule to determine the direction of the flux estab-
lished by 
inside the coupled coils and label this flux 
f) Compare the directions of the two fluxes 
and 
If the fluxes
have the same reference direction, place a dot on the terminal of the
second coil where the test current 
enters. (In Fig. 6.23, the fluxes
and 
have the same reference direction, and therefore a dot
goes on terminal A.) If the fluxes have different reference direc-
tions, place a dot on the terminal of the second coil where the test
current leaves.
The relative polarities of magnetically coupled coils can also be deter-
mined experimentally.This capability is important because in some situations,
determining how the coils are wound on the core is impossible. One experi-
mental method is to connect a dc voltage source, a resistor, a switch, and a dc
voltmeter to the pair of coils, as shown in Fig. 6.24.The shaded box covering
the coils implies that physical inspection of the coils is not possible.The resis-
tor R limits the magnitude of the current supplied by the dc voltage source.
The coil terminal connected to the positive terminal of the dc source
via the switch and limiting resistor receives a polarity mark, as shown in
Fig. 6.24.When the switch is closed, the voltmeter deflection is observed. If
the momentary deflection is upscale, the coil terminal connected to the
positive terminal of the voltmeter receives the polarity mark. If the

6.5 A Closer Look at Mutual Inductance
In order to fully explain the circuit parameter mutual inductance, and to
examine the limitations and assumptions made in the qualitative discussion
presented in Section 6.4, we begin with a more quantitative description of
self-inductance than was previously provided.
A Review of Self-Inductance
The concept of inductance can be traced to Michael Faraday, who did pio-
neering work in this area in the early 1800s. Faraday postulated that a
magnetic field consists of lines of force surrounding the current-carrying
conductor. Visualize these lines of force as energy-storing elastic bands
that close on themselves. As the current increases and decreases, the elas-
tic bands (that is, the lines of force) spread and collapse about the conduc-
tor.The voltage induced in the conductor is proportional to the number of
lines that collapse into, or cut, the conductor. This image of induced volt-
age is expressed by what is called Faraday’s law; that is,
(6.33)
where 
is referred to as the flux linkage and is measured in weber-turns.
How do we get from Faraday’s law to the definition of inductance pre-
sented in Section 6.1? We can begin to draw this connection using Fig. 6.27
as a reference.
The lines threading the 
turns and labeled 
represent the magnetic
lines of force that make up the magnetic field. The strength of the mag-
netic field depends on the strength of the current, and the spatial orienta-
tion of the field depends on the direction of the current. The right-hand
rule relates the orientation of the field to the direction of the current:
When the fingers of the right hand are wrapped around the coil so that the
fingers point in the direction of the current, the thumb points in the direc-
tion of that portion of the magnetic field inside the coil.The flux linkage is
the product of the magnetic field 
, measured in webers (Wb), and the
number of turns linked by the field (
):

Inductance, Capacitance, and Mutual Inductance
The magnitude of the flux,
, is related to the magnitude of the coil
current by the relationship
(6.35)
where 
is the number of turns on the coil, and 
is the permeance of the
space occupied by the flux. Permeance is a quantity that describes the
magnetic properties of this space, and as such, a detailed discussion of per-
meance is outside the scope of this text. Here, we need only observe that,
when the space containing the flux is made up of magnetic materials (such
as iron, nickel, and cobalt), the permeance varies with the flux, giving a
nonlinear relationship between 
and i. But when the space containing the
flux is comprised of nonmagnetic materials, the permeance is constant,
giving a linear relationship between 
and . Note from Eq. 6.35 that the
flux is also proportional to the number of turns on the coil.
Here,we assume that the core material—the space containing the flux—
is nonmagnetic.Then, substituting Eqs. 6.34 and 6.35 into Eq. 6.33 yields
(6.36)
which shows that self-inductance is proportional to the square of the num-
ber of turns on the coil.We make use of this observation later.
The polarity of the induced voltage in the circuit in Fig. 6.27 reflects the
reaction of the field to the current creating the field. For example, when is
increasing,
is positive and 
is positive. Thus energy is required to
establish the magnetic field.The product i gives the rate at which energy is
stored in the field.When the field collapses,
is negative, and again the
polarity of the induced voltage is in opposition to the change. As the field
collapses about the coil, energy is returned to the circuit.
Keeping in mind this further insight into the concept of self-inductance,
we now turn back to mutual inductance.
The Concept of Mutual Inductance
Figure 6.28 shows two magnetically coupled coils. You should verify that
the dot markings on the two coils agree with the direction of the coil wind-
ings and currents shown.The number of turns on each coil are 
and 
respectively. Coil 1 is energized by a time-varying current source that
establishes the current 
in the 
turns. Coil 2 is not energized and is
open. The coils are wound on a nonmagnetic core. The flux produced by
the current 
can be divided into two components, labeled 
and 
The flux component 
is the flux produced by 
that links only the 
turns.The component 
is the flux produced by 
that links the 
turns
and the 
turns. The first digit in the subscript to the flux gives the coil
number, and the second digit refers to the coil current. Thus 
is a flux
linking coil 1 and produced by a current in coil 1, whereas 
is a flux link-
ing coil 2 and produced by a current in coil 1.

We now use Eq. 6.41 and the corresponding expression for 
to write
(6.57)
But for a linear system,
so Eq. 6.57 becomes
(6.58)
Replacing the two terms involving permeances by a single constant
expresses Eq. 6.58 in a more meaningful form:

Substituting Eq. 6.59 into Eq. 6.58 yields
or
(6.60)
where the constant k is called the coefficient of coupling. According to
Eq.6.59,
must be greater than 1,which means that k must be less than 1.
In fact, the coefficient of coupling must lie between 0 and 1, or
(6.61)
The coefficient of coupling is 0 when the two coils have no common
flux; that is, when 
This condition implies that 
and
Eq. 6.59 indicates that 
or 
If there is no flux linkage
between the coils, obviously M is 0.
The coefficient of coupling is equal to 1 when 
and 
are 0. This
condition implies that all the flux that links coil 1 also links coil 2. In terms
of Eq. 6.59,
which obviously represents an ideal state; in
reality, winding two coils so that they share precisely the same flux is phys-
ically impossible. Magnetic materials (such as alloys of iron, cobalt, and
nickel) create a space with high permeance and are used to establish coef-
ficients of coupling that approach unity. (We say more about this impor-
tant quality of magnetic materials in Chapter 9.)

Inductance, Capacitance, and Mutual Inductance
We use the circuit shown in Fig. 6.30 to derive the expression for the
total energy stored in the magnetic fields associated with a pair of linearly
coupled coils. We begin by assuming that the currents 
and 
are zero
and that this zero-current state corresponds to zero energy stored in the
coils.Then we let 
increase from zero to some arbitrary value 
and com-
pute the energy stored when 
Because 
the total power
input into the pair of coils is 
and the energy stored is
(6.62)
Now we hold 
constant at 
and increase 
from zero to some arbitrary
value 
During this time interval, the voltage induced in coil 2 by 
is
zero because 
is constant.The voltage induced in coil 1 by 
is 
Therefore, the power input to the pair of coils is
The total energy stored in the pair of coils when 
is
or
(6.63)
If we reverse the procedure—that is, if we first increase 
from zero to 
and then increase 
from zero to 
—the total energy stored is
(6.64)
Equations 6.63 and 6.64 express the total energy stored in a pair of lin-
early coupled coils as a function of the coil currents, the self-inductances,
and the mutual inductance. Note that the only difference between these
equations is the coefficient of the current product 
We use Eq. 6.63 if
is established first and Eq. 6.64 if 
is established first.

A Closer Look at Mutual Inductance
199
When the coupling medium is linear, the total energy stored is the
same regardless of the order used to establish 
and 
The reason is that
in a linear coupling, the resultant magnetic flux depends only on the final
values of 
and 
not on how the currents reached their final values. If the
resultant flux is the same, the stored energy is the same.Therefore, for lin-
ear coupling,
Also, because 
and 
are arbitrary values of 
and 
respectively, we represent the coil currents by their instantaneous
values 
and 
Thus, at any instant of time, the total energy stored in the
coupled coils is
(6.65)
We derived Eq. 6.65 by assuming that both coil currents entered
polarity-marked terminals.We leave it to you to verify that, if one current
enters a polarity-marked terminal while the other leaves such a terminal,
the algebraic sign of the term 
reverses.Thus, in general,
(6.66)
We use Eq. 6.66 to show that M cannot exceed 
The magneti-
cally coupled coils are passive elements, so the total energy stored can
never be negative. If 
can never be negative, Eq. 6.66 indicates that the
quantity
must be greater than or equal to zero when 
and 
are either both posi-
tive or both negative. The limiting value of M corresponds to setting the
quantity equal to zero:
(6.67)
To find the limiting value of M we add and subtract the term
to the left-hand side of Eq. 6.67. Doing so generates a term that
is a perfect square:
(6.68)
The squared term in Eq. 6.68 can never be negative, but it can be zero.

Practical Perspective
Capacitive Touch Screens
Capacitive touch screens are often used in applications where two or more
simultaneous touch points must be detected. We will discuss two designs for
a multi-touch screen. The first design employs a grid of electrodes, as shown
in Fig. 6.31. When energized, a small parasitic capacitance, Cp, exists between
each electrode strip and ground, as shown in Fig. 6.32(a). When the screen
is touched, say at the position x, y on the screen, a second capacitance exists
due to the transfer of a small amount of charge from the screen to the human
body, which acts like a conductor. The effect is to introduce a second capaci-
tance at the point of touch with respect to ground, as shown in Fig. 6.32(b).
The touchscreen controller is continually monitoring the capacitance
between the electrodes in the grid and ground. If the screen is not being
touched, the capacitance between every electrode in the x-grid and
ground is Cp; the same is true for the capacitance between every elec-
trode in the y-grid and ground.
When the screen is touched at a single point, Ct and Cp combine in 
parallel. The equivalent capacitance between the x-grid electrode closest to
the touch point and ground is now
Ctx = Ct + Cp.

Likewise, the equivalent capacitance between the y-grid electrode closest 
to the touch point and ground is now
Thus, a screen touch increases the capacitance between the electrodes and
ground for the x- and y-grid electrodes closest to the touch point.
Now consider what happens when there are two simultaneous points
where the screen is touched. Assume that the first touch point has coor-
dinates x1, y1 and the second touch point has coordinates x2, y2. Now
there are four screen locations that correspond to an increase in capaci-
tance: x1, y1; x1, y2; x2, y1; and x2, y2. Two of those screen locations
match the two touch points, and the other two points are called “ghost”
points, because the screen was not touched at those points. Therefore,
this method for implementing a capacitive touch screen cannot accu-
rately identify more than a single touch point.
Most modern capacitive touch screens do not use the “self-capacitance”
design discussed above. Instead of measuring the capacitance between
each x-grid electrode and ground, and each y-grid electrode and ground, the
capacitance between each x-grid electrode and each y-grid electrode is
measured. This capacitance is known as “mutual” capacitance and is shown
in Fig. 6.33(a).
When the screen is touched, say at the position x, y on the screen, a
second capacitance again exists due to the transfer of a small amount of
charge from the screen to the human body. A second capacitance exists at
the point of touch with respect to ground, as shown in Fig. 6.33(b).
Therefore, whenever there is a change in the mutual capacitance, Cmxy, the
screen touch point can be uniquely identified as x, y. If the screen is
touched at the points x1, y1 and x2, y2 then there will be precisely two
mutual capacitances that change: Cmx1y1 and Cmx2y2. There are no “ghost”
Cty = Ct + Cp.

Summary
•
Inductance is a linear circuit parameter that relates the
voltage induced by a time-varying magnetic field to the
current producing the field. (See page 176.)
•
Capacitance is a linear circuit parameter that relates the
current induced by a time-varying electric field to the
voltage producing the field. (See page 182.)
•
Inductors and capacitors are passive elements; they can
store and release energy, but they cannot generate or
dissipate energy. (See page 176.)
•
The instantaneous power at the terminals of an inductor
or capacitor can be positive or negative, depending on
whether energy is being delivered to or extracted from
the element.
•
An inductor:
•
does not permit an instantaneous change in its termi-
nal current,
•
does permit an instantaneous change in its teminal
voltage, and
•
behaves as a short circuit in the presence of a constant
terminal current. (See page 188.)
•
A capacitor:
•
does not permit an instantaneous change in its termi-
nal voltage,
•
does permit an instantaneous change in its terminal
current, and
•
behaves as an open circuit in the presence of a con-
stant terminal voltage. (See page 183.)

Summary

•
Equations for voltage, current, power, and energy in
ideal inductors and capacitors are given in Table 6.1.
•
Inductors in series or in parallel can be replaced by an
equivalent inductor. Capacitors in series or in parallel
can be replaced by an equivalent capacitor. The equa-
tions are summarized in Table 6.2. See Section 6.3 for a
discussion on how to handle the initial conditions for
series and parallel equivalent circuits involving induc-
tors and capacitors.
•
Mutual inductance, M, is the circuit parameter relating
the voltage induced in one circuit to a time-varying cur-
rent in another circuit. Specifically,
where 
and 
are the voltage and current in circuit 1,
and 
and 
are the voltage and current in circuit 2. For
coils wound on nonmagnetic cores,
(See page 190.)
•
The dot convention establishes the polarity of mutually
induced voltages:
When the reference direction for a current enters
the dotted terminal of a coil, the reference polar-
ity of the voltage that it induces in the other coil
is positive at its dotted terminal.
Or, alternatively,
When the reference direction for a current leaves
the dotted terminal of a coil, the reference polar-
ity of the voltage that it induces in the other coil
is negative at its dotted terminal.

at time t2 four touch points associated with the 
x, y coordinates (1.8, 4.9) and (3.9, 1.8) are iden-
tified. Comparing the four points at t1 with the

gesture – should the screen be zoomed in or

In Chapter 6, we noted that an important attribute of inductors
and capacitors is their ability to store energy. We are now in a
position to determine the currents and voltages that arise when
energy is either released or acquired by an inductor or capacitor
in response to an abrupt change in a dc voltage or current source.
In this chapter, we will focus on circuits that consist only of
sources, resistors, and either (but not both) inductors or capaci-
tors. For brevity, such configurations are called RL (resistor-
inductor) and RC (resistor-capacitor) circuits.
Our analysis of RL and RC circuits will be divided into three
phases. In the first phase, we consider the currents and voltages
that arise when stored energy in an inductor or capacitor is sud-
denly released to a resistive network. This happens when the
inductor or capacitor is abruptly disconnected from its dc source.
Thus we can reduce the circuit to one of the two equivalent forms
shown in Fig. 7.1 on page 214.The currents and voltages that arise
in this configuration are referred to as the natural response of the
circuit, to emphasize that the nature of the circuit itself, not exter-
nal sources of excitation, determines its behavior.
In the second phase of our analysis, we consider the currents
and voltages that arise when energy is being acquired by an induc-
tor or capacitor due to the sudden application of a dc voltage or
current source. This response is referred to as the step response.
The process for finding both the natural and step responses is the
same; thus, in the third phase of our analysis, we develop a general
method that can be used to find the response of RL and RC cir-
cuits to any abrupt change in a dc voltage or current source.
Figure 7.2 on page 214 shows the four possibilities for the gen-
eral configuration of RL and RC circuits. Note that when there
are no independent sources in the circuit, the Thévenin voltage or
Norton current is zero, and the circuit reduces to one of those
shown in Fig. 7.1; that is, we have a natural-response problem.

CHAPTER

The muscle that makes up the heart contracts due to rhythmical
electrical impulses. The frequency of the impulses is controlled
by pacemaker cells. In adults, the pacemaker cells establish a
resting heart rate of about 72 beats per minutes. But sometimes
the pacemaker cells are damaged and may produce a very low
resting heart rate (a condition known as bradycardia) or a very
high resting heart rate (a condition known as tachycardia). 
A normal heart rhythm can be restored by implanting an artifi-
cial pacemaker that delivers electrical impulses to the heart,
mimicking the pacemaker cells. An example of an artificial 
pacemaker both outside and inside the body is shown in the fig-
ures below.
Artificial pacemakers are very small and lightweight.
They have a programmable microprocessor that monitors a
few parameters and adjusts the heart rate, an efficient bat-
tery with a life of up to 15 years, and circuitry that gener-
ates the pulse. The simplest circuit consists of a resistor and
a capacitor. Once we have introduced the first-order RC 
circuit, we will look at an RC circuit design for artificial
pacemakers.

Response of First-Order RL and RC Circuits
RL and RC circuits are also known as first-order circuits, because their
voltages and currents are described by first-order differential equations. No
matter how complex a circuit may appear,if it can be reduced to a Thévenin or
Norton equivalent connected to the terminals of an equivalent inductor or
capacitor,it is a first-order circuit.(Note that if multiple inductors or capacitors
exist in the original circuit, they must be interconnected so that they can be
replaced by a single equivalent element.)
After introducing the techniques for analyzing the natural and step
responses of first-order circuits, we discuss some special cases of interest.
The first is that of sequential switching, involving circuits in which switching
can take place at two or more instants in time. Next is the unbounded
response. Finally, we analyze a useful circuit called the integrating amplifier.
7.1 The Natural Response 
of an RL Circuit
The natural response of an RL circuit can best be described in terms of the
circuit shown in Fig. 7.3. We assume that the independent current source
generates a constant current of 
and that the switch has been in a
closed position for a long time. We define the phrase a long time more
accurately later in this section. For now it means that all currents and volt-
ages have reached a constant value.Thus only constant, or dc, currents can
exist in the circuit just prior to the switch’s being opened, and therefore
the inductor appears as a short circuit 
prior to the release of
the stored energy.
Because the inductor appears as a short circuit, the voltage across the
inductive branch is zero, and there can be no current in either 
or R.
Therefore, all the source current 
appears in the inductive branch.
Finding the natural response requires finding the voltage and current at
the terminals of the resistor after the switch has been opened, that is, after
the source has been disconnected and the inductor begins releasing
energy. If we let 
denote the instant when the switch is opened, the
problem becomes one of finding 
and 
for 
For 
the cir-
cuit shown in Fig. 7.3 reduces to the one shown in Fig. 7.4.
Deriving the Expression for the Current
To find 
we use Kirchhoff’s voltage law to obtain an expression involv-
ing i, R, and L. Summing the voltages around the closed loop gives
(7.1)
where we use the passive sign convention. Equation 7.1 is known as a first-
order ordinary differential equation, because it contains terms involving
the ordinary derivative of the unknown, that is,
The highest order
derivative appearing in the equation is 1; hence the term first-order.
We can go one step further in describing this equation. The coeffi-
cients in the equation, R and L, are constants; that is, they are not func-
tions of either the dependent variable i or the independent variable t.Thus
the equation can also be described as an ordinary differential equation
with constant coefficients.
To solve Eq. 7.1, we divide by L, transpose the term involving i to the
right-hand side, and then multiply both sides by a differential time dt.The
result is

The Natural Response of an RL Circuit

Next, we recognize the left-hand side of Eq. 7.2 as a differential change in
the current i, that is, di.We now divide through by i, getting
(7.3)
We obtain an explicit expression for i as a function of t by integrating both
sides of Eq. 7.3. Using x and y as variables of integration yields
(7.4)
in which 
is the current corresponding to time 
and 
is the current
corresponding to time t. Here,
Therefore, carrying out the indi-
cated integration gives
(7.5)
Based on the definition of the natural logarithm,
(7.6)
Recall from Chapter 6 that an instantaneous change of current cannot
occur in an inductor. Therefore, in the first instant after the switch has
been opened, the current in the inductor remains unchanged. If we use 
to denote the time just prior to switching, and 
for the time immediately
following switching, then
where, as in Fig. 7.1,
denotes the initial current in the inductor.The initial
current in the inductor is oriented in the same direction as the reference
direction of i. Hence Eq. 7.6 becomes
(7.7)
which shows that the current starts from an initial value 
and decreases
exponentially toward zero as t increases. Figure 7.5 shows this response.
We derive the voltage across the resistor in Fig. 7.4 from a direct appli-
cation of Ohm’s law:
(7.8)
Note that in contrast to the expression for the current shown in Eq. 7.7,
the voltage is defined only for 
not at 
The reason is that a step
change occurs in the voltage at zero. Note that for 
the derivative of
the current is zero, so the voltage is also zero. (This result follows from
) Thus

Response of First-Order RL and RC Circuits
We derive the power dissipated in the resistor from any of the follow-
ing expressions:
(7.11)
Whichever form is used, the resulting expression can be reduced to
(7.12)
The energy delivered to the resistor during any interval of time after the
switch has been opened is
(7.13)
Note from Eq. 7.13 that as t becomes infinite, the energy dissipated in the
resistor approaches the initial energy stored in the inductor.
The Significance of the Time Constant
The expressions for 
(Eq. 7.7) and 
(Eq. 7.8) include a term of the
form 
The coefficient of t—namely,
—determines the rate at
which the current or voltage approaches zero. The reciprocal of this ratio
is the time constant of the circuit, denoted
(7.14)
Using the time-constant concept, we write the expressions for current,
voltage, power, and energy as
(7.15)
(7.16)
(7.17)
(7.18)
The time constant is an important parameter for first-order circuits, so
mentioning several of its characteristics is worthwhile. First, it is conven-
ient to think of the time elapsed after switching in terms of integral multi-
ples of 
Thus one time constant after the inductor has begun to release
its stored energy to the resistor, the current has been reduced to 
or
approximately 0.37 of its initial value.

The Natural Response of an RL Circuit
217
Table 7.1 gives the value of 
for integral multiples of from 1 to
10. Note that when the elapsed time exceeds five time constants, the
current is less than 1% of its initial value. Thus we sometimes say that
five time constants after switching has occurred, the currents and volt-
ages have, for most practical purposes, reached their final values. For
single time-constant circuits (first-order circuits) with 1% accuracy, the
phrase a long time implies that five or more time constants have
elapsed. Thus the existence of current in the RL circuit shown in 
Fig. 7.1(a) is a momentary event and is referred to as the transient
response of the circuit. The response that exists a long time after the
switching has taken place is called the steady-state response.The phrase
a long time then also means the time it takes the circuit to reach its
steady-state value.
Any first-order circuit is characterized, in part, by the value of its
time constant. If we have no method for calculating the time constant of
such a circuit (perhaps because we don’t know the values of its compo-
nents), we can determine its value from a plot of the circuit’s natural
response. That’s because another important characteristic of the time
constant is that it gives the time required for the current to reach its final
value if the current continues to change at its initial rate.To illustrate, we
evaluate 
at 
and assume that the current continues to change at
this rate:
(7.19)
Now, if i starts as 
and decreases at a constant rate of 
amperes per
second, the expression for i becomes
(7.20)
Equation 7.20 indicates that i would reach its final value of zero in 
seconds. Figure 7.6 shows how this graphic interpretation is useful in
estimating the time constant of a circuit from a plot of its natural
response. Such a plot could be generated on an oscilloscope measuring
output current. Drawing the tangent to the natural response plot at 
and reading the value at which the tangent intersects the time axis gives
the value of 
Calculating the natural response of an RL circuit can be summarized
as follows:

7.2 The Natural Response
of an RC Circuit
As mentioned in Section 7.1, the natural response of an RC circuit is anal-
ogous to that of an RL circuit. Consequently, we don’t treat the RC circuit
in the same detail as we did the RL circuit.
The natural response of an RC circuit is developed from the circuit
shown in Fig. 7.10. We begin by assuming that the switch has been in 
position a for a long time, allowing the loop made up of the dc voltage
source 
the resistor 
and the capacitor C to reach a steady-state 
condition. Recall from Chapter 6 that a capacitor behaves as an open cir-
cuit in the presence of a constant voltage. Thus the voltage source cannot
sustain a current, and so the source voltage appears across the capacitor
terminals. In Section 7.3, we will discuss how the capacitor voltage actually
builds to the steady-state value of the dc voltage source, but for now the
important point is that when the switch is moved from position a to posi-
tion b (at 
), the voltage on the capacitor is 
Because there can be
no instantaneous change in the voltage at the terminals of a capacitor, the
problem reduces to solving the circuit shown in Fig. 7.11.

7.2
The Natural Response of an RC Circuit
221
Deriving the Expression for the Voltage
We can easily find the voltage 
by thinking in terms of node voltages.
Using the lower junction between R and C as the reference node and sum-
ming the currents away from the upper junction between R and C gives
(7.21)
Comparing Eq. 7.21 with Eq. 7.1 shows that the same mathematical tech-
niques can be used to obtain the solution for 
We leave it to you to
show that
(7.22)
As we have already noted, the initial voltage on the capacitor equals the
voltage source voltage 
or
(7.23)
where 
denotes the initial voltage on the capacitor.The time constant for
the RC circuit equals the product of the resistance and capacitance,
namely,
(7.24)
Substituting Eqs. 7.23 and 7.24 into Eq. 7.22 yields
(7.25)
which indicates that the natural response of an RC circuit is an exponen-
tial decay of the initial voltage. The time constant RC governs the rate of
decay. Figure 7.12 shows the plot of Eq. 7.25 and the graphic interpreta-
tion of the time constant.

7.3 The Step Response of RL
and RC Circuits
We are now ready to discuss the problem of finding the currents and volt-
ages generated in first-order RL or RC circuits when either dc voltage or
current sources are suddenly applied.The response of a circuit to the sud-
den application of a constant voltage or current source is referred to as the
step response of the circuit. In presenting the step response, we show how
the circuit responds when energy is being stored in the inductor or capac-
itor.We begin with the step response of an RL circuit.
The Step Response of an RL Circuit
To begin, we modify the first-order circuit shown in Fig. 7.2(a) by adding a
switch. We use the resulting circuit, shown in Fig. 7.16, in developing the
step response of an RL circuit. Energy stored in the inductor at the time
the switch is closed is given in terms of a nonzero initial current 
The
task is to find the expressions for the current in the circuit and for the volt-
age across the inductor after the switch has been closed. The procedure is
the same as that used in Section 7.1; we use circuit analysis to derive the
i(0).

After the switch in Fig. 7.16 has been closed, Kirchhoff’s voltage law

Next, we multiply both sides of Eq. 7.30 by a differential time dt.This step
reduces the left-hand side of the equation to a differential change in the
current.Thus

or
We now separate the variables in Eq. 7.31 to get

and then integrate both sides of Eq. 7.32. Using x and y as variables for the
integration, we obtain

Does the value of

is

current is 
in the instant after the switch has been closed. The voltage
drop across the resistor is

tor is the source voltage minus the voltage drop, that is,
When the initial inductor current is zero, Eq. 7.42 simplifies to

also expect the inductor voltage to approach zero as t increases, because the
current in the circuit is approaching the constant value of

Determining the Step Response of an RL Circuit
The switch in the circuit shown in Fig. 7.19 has been
in position a for a long time. At 
the switch
moves from position a to position b. The switch is a
make-before-break type; that is, the connection at
position b is established before the connection at
position a is broken, so there is no interruption of
current through the inductor.

b) What is the initial voltage across the inductor just
after the switch has been moved to position b?
c) How many milliseconds after the switch has been
moved does the inductor voltage equal 24 V?
d) Does this initial voltage make sense in terms of
circuit behavior?
e) Plot both 
and 
versus t.
Figure 7.19  The circuit for Example 7.5.
Solution
a) The switch has been in position a for a long time,
so the 200 mH inductor is a short circuit across
the 8 A current source. Therefore, the inductor
carries an initial current of 8 A. This current is
oriented opposite to the reference direction for i;
thus 
is 
When the switch is in position b,
the final value of i will be 
, or 12 A.The time
constant of the circuit is

rent of 8 A counterclockwise around the newly
formed closed path. This current causes a 16 V
drop across the 
resistor. This voltage drop
adds to the drop across the source, producing a
40 V drop across the inductor.

equals 24 V by solving the expression

NOTE: Also try Chapter Problems 7.35–7.37.
We can also describe the voltage 
across the inductor in Fig. 7.16
directly, not just in terms of the circuit current.We begin by noting that the
voltage across the resistor is the difference between the source voltage
and the inductor voltage.We write
(7.44)
where 
is a constant. Differentiating both sides with respect to time yields
(7.45)
Then, if we multiply each side of Eq. 7.45 by the inductance L, we get an
expression for the voltage across the inductor on the left-hand side, or
(7.46)
Putting Eq. 7.46 into standard form yields
(7.47)
You should verify (in Problem 7.38) that the solution to Eq. 7.47 is identi-
cal to that given in Eq. 7.42.
At this point, a general observation about the step response of an
RL circuit is pertinent. (This observation will prove helpful later.) When
we derived the differential equation for the inductor current, we obtained
Eq. 7.29.We now rewrite Eq. 7.29 as
(7.48)
Observe that Eqs. 7.47 and 7.48 have the same form. Specifically, each
equates the sum of the first derivative of the variable and a constant times
the variable to a constant value. In Eq. 7.47, the constant on the right-hand
side happens to be zero; hence this equation takes on the same form as the
natural response equations in Section 7.1. In both Eq. 7.47 and Eq. 7.48,
the constant multiplying the dependent variable is the reciprocal of the
time constant, that is,
We encounter a similar situation in the
derivations for the step response of an RC circuit. In Section 7.4, we will
use these observations to develop a general approach to finding the natu-
ral and step responses of RL and RC circuits.

The Step Response of an RC Circuit
We can find the step response of a first-order RC circuit by analyzing the
circuit shown in Fig. 7.21. For mathematical convenience, we choose the
Norton equivalent of the network connected to the equivalent capacitor.
Summing the currents away from the top node in Fig. 7.21 generates the
differential equation
(7.49)
Division of Eq. 7.49 by C gives
(7.50)
Comparing Eq. 7.50 with Eq. 7.48 reveals that the form of the solution for
is the same as that for the current in the inductive circuit, namely,
Eq. 7.35. Therefore, by simply substituting the appropriate variables and
coefficients, we can write the solution for 
directly. The translation
requires that 
replace 
C replace L,
replace R, and 
replace 
We get
(7.51)
A similar derivation for the current in the capacitor yields the differential
equation
(7.52)
Equation 7.52 has the same form as Eq. 7.47, hence the solution for i is
obtained by using the same translations used for the solution of
Eq. 7.50. Thus
(7.53)
where 
is the initial value of 
the voltage across the capacitor.
We obtained Eqs. 7.51 and 7.53 by using a mathematical analogy to
the solution for the step response of the inductive circuit. Let’s see
whether these solutions for the RC circuit make sense in terms of
known circuit behavior. From Eq. 7.51, note that the initial voltage
across the capacitor is 
the final voltage across the capacitor is 
and the time constant of the circuit is RC. Also note that the solution
for 
is valid for 
These observations are consistent with the
behavior of a capacitor in parallel with a resistor when driven by a con-
stant current source.
Equation 7.53 predicts that the current in the capacitor at 
is
This prediction makes sense because the capacitor voltage can-
not change instantaneously, and therefore the initial current in the resistor
is 
The capacitor branch current changes instantaneously from zero
at 
to 
at 
The capacitor current is zero at

given by the 
source divided across the
and 
resistors:
Next, we calculate the Thévenin resistance, as
seen to the right of the capacitor, by shorting the
source and making series and parallel
combinations of the resistors:

7.4 A General Solution for Step 
and Natural Responses
The general approach to finding either the natural response or the step
response of the first-order RL and RC circuits shown in Fig. 7.24 is based
on their differential equations having the same form (compare Eq. 7.48
and Eq. 7.50).To generalize the solution of these four possible circuits, we
let 
represent the unknown quantity, giving 
four possible values. It
can represent the current or voltage at the terminals of an inductor or the
current or voltage at the terminals of a capacitor. From Eqs. 7.47, 7.48,
7.50, and 7.52, we know that the differential equation describing any one
of the four circuits in Fig. 7.24 takes the form
(7.54)
where the value of the constant K can be zero. Because the sources in the
circuit are constant voltages and/or currents, the final value of x will be
constant; that is, the final value must satisfy Eq. 7.54, and, when x reaches
its final value, the derivative 
must be zero. Hence
(7.55)
where 
represents the final value of the variable.
We solve Eq. 7.54 by separating the variables, beginning by solving for
the first derivative:

General solution for natural and step
responses of RL and RC circuits 
In writing Eq. 7.56, we used Eq. 7.55 to substitute 
for 
We now mul-
tiply both sides of Eq. 7.56 by dt and divide by 
to obtain
(7.57)
Next, we integrate Eq. 7.57.To obtain as general a solution as possible, we
use time 
as the lower limit and t as the upper limit. Time 
corresponds
to the time of the switching or other change. Previously we assumed that
but this change allows the switching to take place at any time.
Using u and 
as symbols of integration, we get
(7.58)
Carrying out the integration called for in Eq. 7.58 gives
(7.59)
The importance of Eq. 7.59 becomes apparent if we write it out in words:
(7.60)
In many cases, the time of switching—that is,
—is zero.
When computing the step and natural responses of circuits, it may
help to follow these steps:
1. Identify the variable of interest for the circuit. For RC circuits, it is
most convenient to choose the capacitive voltage; for RL circuits,
it is best to choose the inductive current.
2. Determine the initial value of the variable, which is its value at .
Note that if you choose capacitive voltage or inductive current as
your variable of interest, it is not necessary to distinguish between
and 
2 This is because they both are continuous vari-
ables. If you choose another variable, you need to remember that
its initial value is defined at 
3. Calculate the final value of the variable, which is its value as 
4. Calculate the time constant for the circuit.
With these quantities, you can use Eq. 7.60 to produce an equation
describing the variable of interest as a function of time. You can then find
equations for other circuit variables using the circuit analysis techniques
introduced in Chapters 3 and 4 or by repeating the preceding steps for the
other variables.
Examples 7.7–7.9 illustrate how to use Eq. 7.60 to find the step
response of an RC or RL circuit.

Solution
a) The switch has been in position a for a long time,
so the capacitor looks like an open circuit.
Therefore the voltage across the capacitor is the
voltage across the 
resistor. From the voltage-
divider rule, the voltage across the 
resistor
is 
, or 30 V. As the refer-
ence for 
is positive at the upper terminal of
the capacitor, we have 
b) After the switch has been in position b for a long
time, the capacitor will look like an open circuit
in terms of the 90 V source. Thus the final value
of the capacitor voltage is 
c) The time constant is
d) Substituting the appropriate values for 
and t into Eq. 7.60 yields
e) Here the value for 
doesn’t change. Thus we
need to find only the initial and final values for
the current in the capacitor. When obtaining the
initial value, we must get the value of 
because the current in the capacitor can change
instantaneously. This current is equal to the cur-
rent in the resistor, which from Ohm’s law is

Solution
a) Because the initial voltage on the capacitor is
zero, at the instant when the switch is closed the
current in the 
branch will be
The final value of the capacitor current will be
zero because the capacitor eventually will 
appear as an open circuit in terms of dc current.
Thus 
The time constant of the circuit will
equal the product of the Thévenin resistance (as

the switch is closed, the current in the

produces a 90 V drop across the

ages and currents generated by a switching sequence by using the tech-

these solutions to determine the initial conditions for the next position of
the switch or switches.
With sequential switching problems, a premium is placed on obtaining
the initial value

capacitive voltages can change instantaneously at the time of switching.
Thus solving first for inductive currents and capacitive voltages is even
more pertinent in sequential switching problems. Drawing the circuit that

Sequential Switching

Example 7.12
Analyzing an RC Circuit that has Sequential Switching
The uncharged capacitor in the circuit shown in
Fig. 7.35 is initially switched to terminal a of the
three-position switch.At 
the switch is moved
to position b, where it remains for 15 ms. After the
15 ms delay, the switch is moved to position c, where
it remains indefinitely.
a) Derive the numerical expression for the voltage
across the capacitor.
b) Plot the capacitor voltage versus time.
c) When will the voltage on the capacitor equal
200 V?
Solution
a) At the instant the switch is moved to position b,
the initial voltage on the capacitor is zero. If the
switch were to remain in position b, the capacitor
would eventually charge to 400 V. The time con-
stant of the circuit when the switch is in position b
is 10 ms. Therefore we can use Eq. 7.59 with
to write the expression for the capacitor
voltage:
Note that, because the switch remains in posi-
tion b for only 15 ms, this expression is valid only
for the time interval from 0 to 15 ms. After the
switch has been in this position for 15 ms, the
voltage on the capacitor will be
Therefore, when the switch is moved to position c,
the initial voltage on the capacitor is 310.75 V.
With the switch in position c, the final value of
the capacitor voltage is zero, and the time con-
stant is 5 ms. Again, we use Eq. 7.59 to write the
expression for the capacitor voltage:
 = 310.75e-200(t-0.015) V,  15 ms … t.
 v = 0 + (310.75 - 0)e-200(t-0.015)
v(15 ms) = 400 - 400e-1.5 = 310.75 V.
 = (400 - 400e-100t) V,  0 … t … 15 ms.
 v = 400 + (0 - 400)e-100t
t0 = 0
t = 0,

that 
and that this expression is valid

b) Figure 7.36 shows the plot of 
versus t.
c) The plot in Fig. 7.36 reveals that the capacitor
voltage will equal 200 V at two different times:
once in the interval between 0 and 15 ms and
once after 15 ms.We find the first time by solving
the expression
which yields 
We find the second
time by solving the expression

7.6 Unbounded Response
A circuit response may grow, rather than decay, exponentially with time.
This type of response, called an unbounded response, is possible if the cir-
cuit contains dependent sources. In that case, the Thévenin equivalent
resistance with respect to the terminals of either an inductor or a capacitor
may be negative. This negative resistance generates a negative time con-
stant, and the resulting currents and voltages increase without limit. In an
actual circuit, the response eventually reaches a limiting value when a
component breaks down or goes into a saturation state, prohibiting fur-
ther increases in voltage or current.
When we consider unbounded responses, the concept of a final value
is confusing. Hence, rather than using the step response solution given in
Eq. 7.59, we derive the differential equation that describes the circuit con-
taining the negative resistance and then solve it using the separation of
variables technique. Example 7.13 presents an exponentially growing
response in terms of the voltage across a capacitor.

7.7 The Integrating Amplifier
Recall from the introduction to Chapter 5 that one reason for our interest in
the operational amplifier is its use as an integrating amplifier. We are now
ready to analyze an integrating-amplifier circuit, which is shown in Fig. 7.40.
The purpose of such a circuit is to generate an output voltage proportional
to the integral of the input voltage. In Fig. 7.40, we added the branch cur-
rents

Equation 7.66 states that the output voltage of an integrating ampli-
fier equals the initial value of the voltage on the capacitor plus an inverted
(minus sign), scaled 
replica of the integral of the input voltage. If
no energy is stored in the capacitor when integration commences, Eq. 7.66
reduces to

early with time. For example, assume that the input voltage is the rectan-
gular voltage pulse shown in Fig. 7.41.Assume also that the initial value of

an inverted, scaled replica of the integral of the input voltage.
The output voltage is proportional to the integral of the input voltage
only if the op amp operates within its linear range, that is, if it doesn’t sat-
urate. Examples 7.14 and 7.15 further illustrate the analysis of the inte-
grating amplifier.

Response of First-Order RL and RC Circuits
From the examples, we see that the integrating amplifier can perform
the integration function very well, but only within specified limits that
avoid saturating the op amp. The op amp saturates due to the accumula-
tion of charge on the feedback capacitor. We can prevent it from saturat-
ing by placing a resistor in parallel with the feedback capacitor. We
examine such a circuit in Chapter 8.
Note that we can convert the integrating amplifier to a differentiating
amplifier by interchanging the input resistance 
and the feedback capac-
itor 
Then
(7.70)
We leave the derivation of Eq. 7.70 as an exercise for you.The differentiat-
ing amplifier is seldom used because in practice it is a source of unwanted
or noisy signals.
Finally, we can design both integrating- and differentiating-amplifier
circuits by using an inductor instead of a capacitor. However, fabricating
capacitors for integrated-circuit devices is much easier, so inductors are
rarely used in integrating amplifiers.

Practical Perspective
Artificial Pacemaker
We are now ready to analyze a simple RC circuit, shown in Fig. 7.45,
which can generate periodic electrical impulses. This RC circuit can be
used in an artificial pacemaker to establish a normal heart rhythm. The
box labeled “controller” behaves as an open circuit until the voltage drop
across the capacitor reaches a pre-set limit. Once that limit is reached,
the capacitor discharges its stored energy in the form of an electrical
impulse to the heart and starts to recharge and the process repeats.
Before we develop the analytical expressions that describe the behav-
ior of the circuit, let us develop a feel for how that circuit works. First,
when the controller behaves as an open circuit, the dc voltage source will
charge the capacitor via the resistor R, toward a value of Vs volts. But
once the capacitor voltage reaches 
, the controller behaves like a
short circuit, enabling the capacitor to discharge. Once the capacitor dis-
charge is complete, the controller once again acts as an open circuit and
the capacitor starts to recharge. This cycle of charging and discharging
the capacitor establishes the desired heart rhythm, as shown in Fig. 7.46.

Summary
•
A first-order circuit may be reduced to a Thévenin (or
Norton) equivalent connected to either a single equiva-
lent inductor or capacitor. (See page 214.)
•
The natural response is the currents and voltages that
exist when stored energy is released to a circuit that
contains no independent sources. (See page 212.)
•
The time constant of an RL circuit equals the equiva-
lent inductance divided by the Thévenin resistance as
viewed from the terminals of the equivalent inductor.
(See page 216.)
•
The time constant of an RC circuit equals the equiva-
lent capacitance times the Thévenin resistance as
viewed from the terminals of the equivalent capacitor.
(See page 221.)
•
The step response is the currents and voltages that
result from abrupt changes in dc sources connected 
to a circuit. Stored energy may or may not be present
at the time the abrupt changes take place. (See 
page 224.)
•
The solution for either the natural or step response of
both RL and RC circuits involves finding the initial and
final value of the current or voltage of interest and the
time constant of the circuit. Equations 7.59 and 7.60
summarize this approach. (See page 232.)
•
Sequential switching in first-order circuits is analyzed
by dividing the analysis into time intervals correspon-
ding to specific switch positions. Initial values for a par-
ticular interval are determined from the solution
corresponding to the immediately preceding interval.
(See page 236.)
•
An unbounded response occurs when the Thévenin
resistance is negative, which is possible when the
first-order circuit contains dependent sources. (See
page 240.)
•
An integrating amplifier consists of an ideal op amp, a
capacitor in the negative feedback branch, and a resis-
tor in series with the signal source. It outputs the inte-
gral of the signal source, within specified limits that
avoid saturating the op amp. (See page 241.)

is used to describe the fact that the circuit has one
stable state. That is, if left alone, the electronic

7.99 The circuit shown in Fig. P7.99 is known as an
astable multivibrator and finds wide application in
pulse circuits. The purpose of this problem is to
relate the charging and discharging of the capaci-
tors to the operation of the circuit. The key to ana-
lyzing the circuit is to understand the behavior of
the ideal transistor switches 
and 
The circuit is
designed so that the switches automatically alter-
nate between ON and OFF. When

and vice versa.Thus in the analysis of this circuit, we
assume a switch is either ON or OFF.We also assume
that the ideal transistor switch can change its state
instantaneously. In other words, it can snap from

Natural and Step
Responses of RLC Circuits
CHAPTER
88
In this chapter, discussion of the natural response and step
response of circuits containing both inductors and capacitors is
limited to two simple structures: the parallel RLC circuit and the
series RLC circuit. Finding the natural response of a parallel RLC
circuit consists of finding the voltage created across the parallel
branches by the release of energy stored in the inductor or capac-
itor or both. The task is defined in terms of the circuit shown in
Fig. 8.1 on page 266.The initial voltage on the capacitor,
, repre-
sents the initial energy stored in the capacitor. The initial current
through the inductor,
, represents the initial energy stored in the
inductor. If the individual branch currents are of interest, you can
find them after determining the terminal voltage.
We derive the step response of a parallel RLC circuit by using
Fig. 8.2 on page 266.We are interested in the voltage that appears
across the parallel branches as a result of the sudden application
of a dc current source. Energy may or may not be stored in the
circuit when the current source is applied.
Finding the natural response of a series RLC circuit consists
of finding the current generated in the series-connected elements
by the release of initially stored energy in the inductor, capacitor,
or both. The task is defined by the circuit shown in Fig. 8.3 on
page 266. As before, the initial inductor current,
, and the initial
capacitor voltage,
, represent the initially stored energy. If any
of the individual element voltages are of interest, you can find
them after determining the current.
We describe the step response of a series RLC circuit in terms
of the circuit shown in Fig. 8.4 on page 266. We are interested in
the current resulting from the sudden application of the dc volt-
age source. Energy may or may not be stored in the circuit when
the switch is closed.
If you have not studied ordinary differential equations, deri-
vation of the natural and step responses of parallel and series
RLC circuits may be a bit difficult to follow. However, the results
are important enough to warrant presentation at this time. We
begin with the natural response of a parallel RLC circuit and
cover this material over two sections: one to discuss the solution
of the differential equation that describes the circuit and one to
present the three distinct forms that the solution can take.

The digital circuits found in most computers require a timing
signal that synchronizes the operation of the circuits. Consider
a laptop computer whose processor speed is 2 GHz. This means
that the central processing unit for this computer can perform
about 2
109 simple operations every second.
The timing signal, produced by a clock generator chip, is
typically a square wave with the required clock frequency. The
square wave is obtained from a sinusoidal wave with the
required clock frequency. Typically, the sinusoidal wave is
generated by precisely-cut quartz crystal with an applied volt-
age. The crystal produces a very stable frequency suitable for
synchronizing digital circuits.
But we can also generate a sinusoidal wave using a cir-
cuit with an inductor and a capacitor. By choosing the values
of inductance and capacitance, we can create a sinusoid with
a specific frequency. We will examine such a design once we
have presented the fundamental concepts of second-order
circuits.

Natural and Step Responses of RLC Circuits
8.1 Introduction to the Natural
Response of a Parallel RLC Circuit
The first step in finding the natural response of the circuit shown in Fig. 8.1
is to derive the differential equation that the voltage 
must satisfy. We
choose to find the voltage first, because it is the same for each component.
After that, a branch current can be found by using the current-voltage
relationship for the branch component. We easily obtain the differential
equation for the voltage by summing the currents away from the top node,
where each current is expressed as a function of the unknown voltage :
(8.1)
We eliminate the integral in Eq. 8.1 by differentiating once with respect to t,
and, because 
is a constant, we get
(8.2)
We now divide through Eq. 8.2 by the capacitance C and arrange the
derivatives in descending order:
(8.3)
Comparing Eq. 8.3 with the differential equations derived in Chapter 7
reveals that they differ by the presence of the term involving the second
derivative. Equation 8.3 is an ordinary, second-order differential equation
with constant coefficients. Circuits in this chapter contain both inductors and
capacitors, so the differential equation describing these circuits is of the sec-
ond order.Therefore, we sometimes call such circuits second-order circuits.
The General Solution of the Second-Order Differential
Equation
We can’t solve Eq. 8.3 by separating the variables and integrating as we
were able to do with the first-order equations in Chapter 7. The classical
approach to solving Eq. 8.3 is to assume that the solution is of exponential
form, that is, to assume that the voltage is of the form
(8.4)
where A and s are unknown constants.
Before showing how this assumption leads to the solution of Eq. 8.3,
we need to show that it is rational.The strongest argument we can make in
favor of Eq. 8.4 is to note from Eq. 8.3 that the second derivative of the

the natural and step responses of series RLC circuits.

solution, plus a constant times the first derivative, plus a constant times the
solution itself, must sum to zero for all values of t. This can occur only if
higher order derivatives of the solution have the same form as the solu-
tion. The exponential function satisfies this criterion. A second argument
in favor of Eq. 8.4 is that the solutions of all the first-order equations we
derived in Chapter 7 were exponential. It seems reasonable to assume that
the solution of the second-order equation also involves the exponential
function.
If Eq. 8.4 is a solution of Eq. 8.3, it must satisfy Eq. 8.3 for all values of t.
Substituting Eq. 8.4 into Eq. 8.3 generates the expression
or
(8.5)
which can be satisfied for all values of t only if A is zero or the parentheti-
cal term is zero, because 
for any finite values of st. We cannot use
as a general solution because to do so implies that the voltage is
zero for all time—a physical impossibility if energy is stored in either the
inductor or capacitor. Therefore, in order for Eq. 8.4 to be a solution of
Eq. 8.3, the parenthetical term in Eq. 8.5 must be zero, or
(8.6)
Equation 8.6 is called the characteristic equation of the differential equa-
tion because the roots of this quadratic equation determine the mathe-
matical character of 
The two roots of Eq. 8.6 are
(8.7)
(8.8)
If either root is substituted into Eq. 8.4, the assumed solution satisfies the
given differential equation, that is, Eq. 8.3. Note from Eq. 8.5 that this
result holds regardless of the value of A.Therefore, both

and 
respectively, we can
show that their sum also is a solution. Specifically, if we let
(8.9)
then
(8.10)
(8.11)
Substituting Eqs. 8.9–8.11 into Eq. 8.3 gives
(8.12)
But each parenthetical term is zero because by definition 
and 
are
roots of the characteristic equation. Hence the natural response of the
parallel RLC circuit shown in Fig. 8.1 is of the form
(8.13)
Equation 8.13 is a repeat of the assumption made in Eq. 8.9. We have
shown that 
is a solution,
is a solution, and 
is a solution.
Therefore, the general solution of Eq. 8.3 has the form given in Eq. 8.13.
The roots of the characteristic equation (
and 
) are determined by the
circuit parameters R, L, and C.The initial conditions determine the values
of the constants 
and 
Note that the form of Eq. 8.13 must be modi-
fied if the two roots 
and 
are equal.We discuss this modification when
we turn to the critically damped voltage response in Section 8.2.
The behavior of 
depends on the values of

Therefore the
first step in finding the natural response is to determine the roots of the
characteristic equation. We return to Eqs. 8.7 and 8.8 and rewrite them

Introduction to the Natural Response of a Parallel RLC Circuit

The exponent of e must be dimensionless, so both 
and 
(and
hence 
and 
) must have the dimension of the reciprocal of time, or fre-
quency. To distinguish among the frequencies 
and 
we use the
following terminology:
and 
are referred to as complex frequencies,
is called the neper frequency, and 
is the resonant radian frequency. The
full significance of this terminology unfolds as we move through the
remaining chapters of this book. All these frequencies have the dimen-
sion of angular frequency per time. For complex frequencies, the neper
frequency, and the resonant radian frequency, we specify values using the
unit radians per second (
).The nature of the roots 
and 
depends
on the values of 
and 
There are three possible outcomes. First, if
both roots will be real and distinct. For reasons to be discussed
later, the voltage response is said to be overdamped in this case. Second,
if 
both 
and 
will be complex and, in addition, will be conju-
gates of each other. In this situation, the voltage response is said to be
underdamped. The third possible outcome is that 
In this case,
and 
will be real and equal. Here the voltage response is said to be
critically damped. As we shall see, damping affects the way the voltage
response reaches its final (or steady-state) value. We discuss each case
separately in Section 8.2.

8.2 The Forms of the Natural Response
of a Parallel RLC Circuit
So far we have seen that the behavior of a second-order RLC circuit depends
on the values of 
and 
which in turn depend on the circuit parameters R,
L, and C.Therefore, the first step in finding the natural response is to calcu-
late these values and, relatedly, determine whether the response is over-,
under-, or critically damped.
Completing the description of the natural response requires finding two
unknown coefficients, such as 
and 
in Eq. 8.13.The method used to do
this is based on matching the solution for the natural response to the initial
conditions imposed by the circuit,which are the initial value of the current (or
voltage) and the initial value of the first derivative of the current (or voltage).
Note that these same initial conditions,plus the final value of the variable,will
also be needed when finding the step response of a second-order circuit.
In this section, we analyze the natural response form for each of the
three types of damping,beginning with the overdamped response.As we will
see, the response equations, as well as the equations for evaluating the
unknown coefficients, are slightly different for each of the three damping
configurations.This is why we want to determine at the outset of the problem
whether the response is over-, under-, or critically damped.

The Overdamped Voltage Response
When the roots of the characteristic equation are real and distinct, the volt-
age response of a parallel RLC circuit is said to be overdamped. The solu-
tion for the voltage is of the form
(8.18)
where 
and 
are the roots of the characteristic equation. The constants
and 
are determined by the initial conditions, specifically from the
values of 
and 
which in turn are determined from the ini-
tial voltage on the capacitor,
and the initial current in the inductor,
Next, we show how to use the initial voltage on the capacitor and the
initial current in the inductor to find

Solution
a) The inductor prevents an instantaneous change

current is 30 mA:
The capacitor holds the initial voltage across the
parallel elements to 12 V. Thus the initial current
in the resistive branch,
is 
or
60 mA. Kirchhoff’s current law requires the sum
of the currents leaving the top node to equal
zero at every instant. Hence
Note that if we assumed the inductor current and
capacitor voltage had reached their dc values at
the instant that energy begins to be released,
In other words, there is an instanta-
neous change in the capacitor current at

The term 
is called the damped radian frequency. We explain later the
reason for this terminology.
The underdamped voltage response of a parallel RLC circuit is
(8.28)
which follows from Eq. 8.18. In making the transition from Eq. 8.18 to
Eq. 8.28, we use the Euler identity:

constants

Let’s look at the general nature of the underdamped response. First,
the trigonometric functions indicate that this response is oscillatory; that
is, the voltage alternates between positive and negative values.The rate at
which the voltage oscillates is fixed by 
Second, the amplitude of the
oscillation decreases exponentially. The rate at which the amplitude falls

Thus when 
is not zero, the frequency of
oscillation is said to be damped.
The oscillatory behavior is possible because of the two types of energy-
storage elements in the circuit: the inductor and the capacitor. (A mechan-
ical analogy of this electric circuit is that of a mass suspended on a spring,
where oscillation is possible because energy can be stored in both the
spring and the moving mass.) We say more about the characteristics of the
underdamped response following Example 8.4, which examines a circuit
whose response is underdamped. In summary, note that the overall
process for finding the underdamped response is the same as that for the
overdamped response, although the response equations and the simulta-
neous equations used to find the constants are slightly different.

Characteristics of the Underdamped Response
The underdamped response has several important characteristics. First, as
the dissipative losses in the circuit decrease, the persistence of the oscilla-
tions increases, and the frequency of the oscillations approaches 
In
other words, as 
the dissipation in the circuit in Fig. 8.8 approaches
zero because 
As 
which tells us that 
When 
the maximum amplitude of the voltage remains constant;
thus the oscillation at 
is sustained. In Example 8.4, if R were increased
to infinity, the solution for 
would become
Thus, in this case the oscillation is sustained, the maximum amplitude of
the voltage is 98 V, and the frequency of oscillation is 
.
We may now describe qualitatively the difference between an under-
damped and an overdamped response. In an underdamped system, the
response oscillates, or “bounces,” about its final value. This oscillation is
also referred to as ringing. In an overdamped system, the response
approaches its final value without ringing or in what is sometimes
described as a “sluggish” manner.When specifying the desired response of
a second order system, you may want to reach the final value in the short-
est time possible, and you may not be concerned with small oscillations
about that final value. If so, you would design the system components to
achieve an underdamped response. On the other hand, you may be con-
cerned that the response not exceed its final value, perhaps to ensure that
components are not damaged. In such a case, you would design the system
components to achieve an overdamped response, and you would have to
accept a relatively slow rise to the final value.

choose component values that satisfy an exact equality relationship.

A Summary of the Results
We conclude our discussion of the parallel RLC circuit’s natural response
with a brief summary of the results. The first step in finding the natural
response is to calculate the roots of the characteristic equation. You then
know immediately whether the response is overdamped, underdamped, or
critically damped.
If the roots are real and distinct (
), the response is over-
damped and the voltage is
where
The values of 
and 
are determined by solving the following simulta-
neous equations:
If the roots are complex 
the response is underdamped and
the voltage is

Natural and Step Responses of RLC Circuits
8.3 The Step Response of a Parallel 
RLC Circuit
Finding the step response of a parallel RLC circuit involves finding the
voltage across the parallel branches or the current in the individual
branches as a result of the sudden application of a dc current source.
There may or may not be energy stored in the circuit when the current
source is applied.The task is represented by the circuit shown in Fig. 8.11.
To develop a general approach to finding the step response of a second-
order circuit, we focus on finding the current in the inductive branch (
).
This current is of particular interest because it does not approach zero as
t increases. Rather, after the switch has been open for a long time, the
inductor current equals the dc source current I. Because we want to focus
on the technique for finding the step response, we assume that the initial
energy stored in the circuit is zero.This assumption simplifies the calcula-
tions and doesn’t alter the basic process involved. In Example 8.10
we will see how the presence of initially stored energy enters into the
general procedure.
To find the inductor current 
we must solve a second-order differ-
ential equation equated to the forcing function I, which we derive as fol-
lows. From Kirchhoff’s current law, we have
or
(8.37)
Because
(8.38)
we get
(8.39)
Substituting Eqs. 8.38 and 8.39 into Eq. 8.37 gives
(8.40)
For convenience, we divide through by LC and rearrange terms:
(8.41)
Comparing Eq. 8.41 with Eq. 8.3 reveals that the presence of a nonzero
term on the right-hand side of the equation alters the task. Before show-
ing how to solve Eq. 8.41 directly, we obtain the solution indirectly.
When we know the solution of Eq. 8.41, explaining the direct approach
will be easier.

281
The Indirect Approach
We can solve for 
indirectly by first finding the voltage .We do this with
the techniques introduced in Section 8.2, because the differential equation
that 
must satisfy is identical to Eq. 8.3. To see this, we simply return to
Eq. 8.37 and express 
as a function of ; thus
(8.42)
Differentiating Eq. 8.42 once with respect to t reduces the right-hand side
to zero because I is a constant.Thus
or
(8.43)
As discussed in Section 8.2, the solution for 
depends on the roots of the
characteristic equation.Thus the three possible solutions are
(8.44)
(8.45)
(8.46)
A word of caution: Because there is a source in the circuit for 
you
must take into account the value of the source current at 
when you
evaluate the coefficients in Eqs. 8.44–8.46.
To find the three possible solutions for 
we substitute Eqs. 8.44–8.46
into Eq. 8.37. You should be able to verify, when this has been done, that
the three solutions for 
will be
(8.47)
(8.48)
(8.49)
where 
and 
are arbitrary constants.
In each case, the primed constants can be found indirectly in terms of
the arbitrary constants associated with the voltage solution. However, this
approach is cumbersome.
The Direct Approach
It is much easier to find the primed constants directly in terms of the ini-
tial values of the response function. For the circuit being discussed, we
would find the primed constants from 
and 
The solution for a second-order differential equation with a constant
forcing function equals the forced response plus a response function

a) No energy is stored in the circuit prior to the
application of the dc current source, so the initial
current in the inductor is zero. The inductor pro-
hibits an instantaneous change in inductor cur-
rent; therefore 
immediately after the
switch has been opened.
b) The initial voltage on the capacitor is zero
before the switch has been opened; therefore it
will be zero immediately after. Now, because

When you have obtained the natural current response, you can find the
natural voltage response across any circuit element.
To verify that the procedure for finding the step response of a series
RLC circuit is the same as that for a parallel RLC circuit, we show that the
differential equation that describes the capacitor voltage in Fig. 8.15 has
the same form as the differential equation that describes the inductor cur-
rent in Fig. 8.11. For convenience, we assume that zero energy is stored in
the circuit at the instant the switch is closed.
Applying Kirchhoff’s voltage law to the circuit shown in Fig. 8.15 gives

grator is related to the input voltage of the first by a second-order differ-
ential equation.We begin our analysis of a circuit containing two cascaded
amplifiers with the circuit shown in Fig. 8.18.

Section 7.7 that the reason the op amp in the integrating amplifier satu-
rates is the feedback capacitor’s accumulation of charge. Here, a resistor is
placed in parallel with each feedback capacitor (

determine the impact of these feedback resistors on the integrating ampli-
fiers from Example 8.13.

Practical Perspective
Clock for Computer Timing
Consider the circuit in Fig. 8.21, where the output is the voltage drop across
the capacitor. For 
this circuit looks like a series RLC natural-response
circuit of Fig. 8.3 without its resistor. When we analyze this LC circuit, we
will discover that its output is an undamped sinusoid, which could be used
by a computer’s clock generator instead of the typical quartz crystal oscilla-
tor. We will be able to specify the frequency of the clock by selecting appro-
priate values for the inductor and capacitor.

The describing differential equation is thus
What mathematical function can be added to its second derivative to get

This equation is satisfied when

The frequency 
is the familiar resonant radian frequency of both the series

We choose the value of A to satisfy the initial condition for the current
in the inductor:
so   
Therefore, the current for the circuit in Fig. 8.21 is
where 
.
We can now use the expression for the current in the circuit to find the volt-
age output by the capacitor:
By choosing values for L and C we can use the circuit in Fig. 8.21 to gener-
ate an undamped sinusoid for 
for a computer’s clock generator.
So why is a quartz crystal used to generate the sinusoid for the clock
generator instead of the LC circuit of Fig. 8.21? Remember that our analysis
of the LC circuit assumed that the inductor and capacitor are ideal. But ideal
inductors and capacitors do not exist – real inductors and capacitors have a
small amount of resistance. We leave it to you to examine the effect of this
small amount of resistance on the performance of an LC oscillator in the
Chapter Problems.

critically damped, and then we solve the appropriate
equations as shown in Table 8.3.
•
In determining the step response of a second-order cir-
cuit, we apply the appropriate equations depending on
the damping, as shown in Table 8.4.
•
For each of the three forms of response, the unknown
coefficients (i.e., the As, B s, and Ds) are obtained by
evaluating the circuit to find the initial value of the
response,
and the initial value of the first deriva-
tive of the response,
•
When two integrating amplifiers with ideal op amps are
connected in cascade, the output voltage of the second
integrator is related to the input voltage of the first by an
ordinary, second-order differential equation. Therefore,
the techniques developed in this chapter may be used to
analyze the behavior of a cascaded integrator. (See
pages 289 and 290.)
•
We can overcome the limitation of a simple integrating
amplifier—the saturation of the op amp due to charge
accumulating in the feedback capacitor—by placing a
resistor in parallel with the capacitor in the feedback
path. (See page 291.)

Thus far, we have focused on circuits with constant sources; in
this chapter we are now ready to consider circuits energized by
time-varying voltage or current sources. In particular, we are inter-
ested in sources in which the value of the voltage or current varies
sinusoidally.Sinusoidal sources and their effect on circuit behavior
form an important area of study for several reasons. First, the gen-
eration, transmission, distribution, and consumption of electric
energy occur under essentially sinusoidal steady-state conditions.
Second, an understanding of sinusoidal behavior makes it possible
to predict the behavior of circuits with nonsinusoidal sources.
Third, steady-state sinusoidal behavior often simplifies the design
of electrical systems.Thus a designer can spell out specifications in
terms of a desired steady-state sinusoidal response and design the
circuit or system to meet those characteristics. If the device satis-
fies the specifications, the designer knows that the circuit will
respond satisfactorily to nonsinusoidal inputs.
The subsequent chapters of this book are largely based on a
thorough understanding of the techniques needed to analyze cir-
cuits driven by sinusoidal sources. Fortunately, the circuit analysis
and simplification techniques first introduced in Chapters 1–4
work for circuits with sinusoidal as well as dc sources, so some of
the material in this chapter will be very familiar to you.The chal-
lenges in first approaching sinusoidal analysis include developing
the appropriate modeling equations and working in the mathe-
matical realm of complex numbers.

Steady-State Analysis
CHAPTER

Power systems that generate, transmit, and distribute electri-
cal power are designed to operate in the sinusoidal steady
state. The standard household distribution circuit used in the
United States is the three-wire, 240/120 V circuit shown in
the accompanying figure.
The transformer is used to reduce the utility distribution
voltage from 13.2 kV to 240 V. The center tap on the second-
ary winding provides the 120 V service. The operating fre-
quency of power systems in the United States is 60 Hz. Both
50 and 60 Hz systems are found outside the United States.
The voltage ratings alluded to above are rms values. The rea-
son for defining an rms value of a time-varying signal is
explained in Chapter 10.

Sinusoidal Steady-State Analysis
9.1 The Sinusoidal Source
A sinusoidal voltage source (independent or dependent) produces a volt-
age that varies sinusoidally with time. A sinusoidal current source (inde-
pendent or dependent) produces a current that varies sinusoidally with
time. In reviewing the sinusoidal function, we use a voltage source, but our
observations also apply to current sources.
We can express a sinusoidally varying function with either the sine
function or the cosine function. Although either works equally well, we
cannot use both functional forms simultaneously. We will use the cosine
function throughout our discussion. Hence, we write a sinusoidally varying
voltage as
(9.1)
To aid discussion of the parameters in Eq. 9.1, we show the voltage
versus time plot in Fig. 9.1.
Note that the sinusoidal function repeats at regular intervals. Such a
function is called periodic. One parameter of interest is the length of time
required for the sinusoidal function to pass through all its possible values.
This time is referred to as the period of the function and is denoted T. It is
measured in seconds. The reciprocal of T gives the number of cycles per
second, or the frequency, of the sine function and is denoted f, or
(9.2)
A cycle per second is referred to as a hertz, abbreviated Hz. (The term
cycles per second rarely is used in contemporary technical literature.) The
coefficient of t in Eq. 9.1 contains the numerical value of T or f. Omega ( )
represents the angular frequency of the sinusoidal function, or
(9.3)
Equation 9.3 is based on the fact that the cosine (or sine) function passes
through a complete set of values each time its argument,
passes
through 
rad (
). From Eq. 9.3, note that, whenever t is an integral
multiple of T, the argument 
increases by an integral multiple of 
rad.
The coefficient 
gives the maximum amplitude of the sinusoidal
voltage. Because 
bounds the cosine function,
bounds the ampli-
tude. Figure 9.1 shows these characteristics.
The angle 
in Eq. 9.1 is known as the phase angle of the sinusoidal
voltage. It determines the value of the sinusoidal function at 
there-
fore, it fixes the point on the periodic wave at which we start measuring
time. Changing the phase angle 
shifts the sinusoidal function along the
time axis but has no effect on either the amplitude (
) or the angular fre-
quency ( ). Note, for example, that reducing 
to zero shifts the sinusoidal
function shown in Fig. 9.1
time units to the right, as shown in Fig. 9.2.
Note also that if 
is positive, the sinusoidal function shifts to the left,
whereas if 
is negative, the function shifts to the right. (See Problem 9.5.)
A comment with regard to the phase angle is in order:
and 
must
carry the same units, because they are added together in the argument of
the sinusoidal function. With 
expressed in radians, you would expect 
to be also. However,
normally is given in degrees, and 
is converted
from radians to degrees before the two quantities are added.We continue

this bias toward degrees by expressing the phase angle in degrees. Recall
from your studies of trigonometry that the conversion from radians to
degrees is given by
(9.4)
Another important characteristic of the sinusoidal voltage (or cur-
rent) is its rms value.The rms value of a periodic function is defined as the
square root of the mean value of the squared function. Hence, if
the rms value of 
is
(9.5)
Note from Eq. 9.5 that we obtain the mean value of the squared voltage by
integrating 
over one period (that is, from 
to 
) and then dividing
by the range of integration, T. Note further that the starting point for the
integration 
is arbitrary.
The quantity under the radical sign in Eq. 9.5 reduces to 
(See
Problem 9.6.) Hence the rms value of 
is
(9.6)
The rms value of the sinusoidal voltage depends only on the maximum
amplitude of , namely,
The rms value is not a function of either the
frequency or the phase angle.We stress the importance of the rms value as
it relates to power calculations in Chapter 10 (see Section 10.3).
Thus, we can completely describe a specific sinusoidal signal if we know
its frequency, phase angle, and amplitude (either the maximum or the rms
value). Examples 9.1, 9.2, and 9.3 illustrate these basic properties of the
sinusoidal function. In Example 9.4, we calculate the rms value of a periodic
function, and in so doing we clarify the meaning of root mean square.

9.2 The Sinusoidal Response
Before focusing on the steady-state response to sinusoidal sources, let’s
consider the problem in broader terms, that is, in terms of the total
response. Such an overview will help you keep the steady-state solution in
perspective. The circuit shown in Fig. 9.5 describes the general nature of
the problem.There,
is a sinusoidal voltage, or
(9.7)
For convenience, we assume the initial current in the circuit to be zero and
measure time from the moment the switch is closed. The task is to derive
the expression for 
when 
It is similar to finding the step response
of an RL circuit, as in Chapter 7. The only difference is that the voltage
source is now a time-varying sinusoidal voltage rather than a constant, or
dc, voltage. Direct application of Kirchhoff’s voltage law to the circuit
shown in Fig. 9.5 leads to the ordinary differential equation

Thus we can easily
determine for a circuit driven by a sinusoidal source of known frequency.
We can check the validity of Eq. 9.9 by determining that it satisfies
Eq. 9.8 for all values of 
; this exercise is left for your exploration in
Problem 9.10.
The first term on the right-hand side of Eq. 9.9 is referred to as the
transient component of the current because it becomes infinitesimal as
time elapses. The second term on the right-hand side is known as the
steady-state component of the solution. It exists as long as the switch
remains closed and the source continues to supply the sinusoidal voltage.
In this chapter, we develop a technique for calculating the steady-state
response directly, thus avoiding the problem of solving the differential
equation. However, in using this technique we forfeit obtaining either the
transient component or the total response, which is the sum of the tran-
sient and steady-state components.
We now focus on the steady-state portion of Eq. 9.9. It is important to
remember the following characteristics of the steady-state solution:
1. The steady-state solution is a sinusoidal function.
2. The frequency of the response signal is identical to the frequency of
the source signal. This condition is always true in a linear circuit
when the circuit parameters, R, L, and C, are constant. (If frequen-
cies in the response signals are not present in the source signals,
there is a nonlinear element in the circuit.)
3. The maximum amplitude of the steady-state response, in general,
differs from the maximum amplitude of the source. For the circuit
being discussed, the maximum amplitude of the response signal is
and the maximum amplitude of the signal source
is 
4. The phase angle of the response signal, in general, differs from the
phase angle of the source. For the circuit being discussed, the phase
angle of the current is 
and that of the voltage source is 
These characteristics are worth remembering because they help you
understand the motivation for the phasor method, which we introduce in
Section 9.3. In particular, note that once the decision has been made to
find only the steady-state response, the task is reduced to finding the max-
imum amplitude and phase angle of the response signal. The waveform
and frequency of the response are already known.
NOTE: Assess your understanding of this material by trying Chapter
Problem 9.9.
9.3 The Phasor
The phasor is a complex number that carries the amplitude and phase
angle information of a sinusoidal function.1 The phasor concept is rooted
in Euler’s identity, which relates the exponential function to the trigono-
metric function:
(9.10)
Equation 9.10 is important here because it gives us another way of express-
ing the cosine and sine functions.We can think of the cosine function as the

real part of the exponential function and the sine function as the imaginary
part of the exponential function; that is,
(9.11)
and
(9.12)
where 
means “the real part of” and 
means “the imaginary part of.”
Because we have already chosen to use the cosine function in analyz-
ing the sinusoidal steady state (see Section 9.1), we can apply Eq. 9.11
directly. In particular, we write the sinusoidal voltage function given by
Eq. 9.1 in the form suggested by Eq. 9.11:
(9.13)
We can move the coefficient 
inside the argument of the real part of the
function without altering the result. We can also reverse the order of the
two exponential functions inside the argument and write Eq. 9.13 as
(9.14)
In Eq. 9.14, note that the quantity 
is a complex number that carries
the amplitude and phase angle of the given sinusoidal function. This
complex number is by definition the phasor representation, or phasor
transform, of the given sinusoidal function. Thus
(9.15)
where the notation 
is read “the phasor transform of
”Thus the phasor transform transfers the sinusoidal func-
tion from the time domain to the complex-number domain, which is also
called the frequency domain, since the response depends, in general, on 
As in Eq. 9.15, throughout this book we represent a phasor quantity by
using a boldface letter.
Equation 9.15 is the polar form of a phasor, but we also can express a
phasor in rectangular form.Thus we rewrite Eq. 9.15 as
(9.16)
Both polar and rectangular forms are useful in circuit applications of the
phasor concept.
One additional comment regarding Eq. 9.15 is in order. The frequent
occurrence of the exponential function 
has led to an abbreviation that
lends itself to text material.This abbreviation is the angle notation
We use this notation extensively in the material that follows.

Sinusoidal Steady-State Analysis
Inverse Phasor Transform
So far we have emphasized moving from the sinusoidal function to its pha-
sor transform. However, we may also reverse the process. That is, for a
phasor we may write the expression for the sinusoidal function. Thus for
the expression for 
is 
because we
have decided to use the cosine function for all sinusoids. Observe that we
cannot deduce the value of 
from the phasor. The phasor carries only
amplitude and phase information. The step of going from the phasor
transform to the time-domain expression is referred to as finding the
inverse phasor transform and is formalized by the equation
(9.17)
where the notation 
is read as “the inverse phasor transform of
”Equation 9.17 indicates that to find the inverse phasor transform,we
multiply the phasor by 
and then extract the real part of the product.
The phasor transform is useful in circuit analysis because it reduces
the task of finding the maximum amplitude and phase angle of the steady-
state sinusoidal response to the algebra of complex numbers. The follow-
ing observations verify this conclusion:
1. The transient component vanishes as time elapses, so the steady-
state component of the solution must also satisfy the differential
equation. (See Problem 9.10[b].)
2. In a linear circuit driven by sinusoidal sources, the steady-state
response also is sinusoidal, and the frequency of the sinusoidal
response is the same as the frequency of the sinusoidal source.
3. Using the notation introduced in Eq. 9.11, we can postulate that the
steady-state solution is of the form 
where A is the
maximum amplitude of the response and 
is the phase angle of the
response.
4. When we substitute the postulated steady-state solution into the
differential equation, the exponential term 
cancels out, leaving
the solution for A and 
in the domain of
complex numbers.
We illustrate these observations with the circuit shown in Fig. 9.5 (see
p. 309).We know that the steady-state solution for the current i is of the form
(9.18)
where the subscript “ss” emphasizes that we are dealing with the steady-
state solution. When we substitute Eq. 9.18 into Eq. 9.8, we generate the
expression
(9.19)
In deriving Eq. 9.19 we recognized that both differentiation and multiplica-
tion by a constant can be taken inside the real part of an operation.We also
rewrote the right-hand side of Eq. 9.8, using the notation of Eq. 9.11. From

the algebra of complex numbers,we know that the sum of the real parts is the
same as the real part of the sum.Therefore we may reduce the left-hand side
of Eq. 9.19 to a single term:
(9.20)
Recall that our decision to use the cosine function in analyzing the
response of a circuit in the sinusoidal steady state results in the use of
the 
operator in deriving Eq. 9.20. If instead we had chosen to use the
sine function in our sinusoidal steady-state analysis, we would have
applied Eq. 9.12 directly, in place of Eq. 9.11, and the result would be
Eq. 9.21:
(9.21)
Note that the complex quantities on either side of Eq. 9.21 are identical to
those on either side of Eq. 9.20.When both the real and imaginary parts of
two complex quantities are equal, then the complex quantities are them-
selves equal.Therefore, from Eqs. 9.20 and 9.21,
or
(9.22)
Note that 
has been eliminated from the determination of the ampli-
tude (
) and phase angle ( ) of the response. Thus, for this circuit, the
task of finding 
and 
involves the algebraic manipulation of the com-
plex quantities 
and 
Note that we encountered both polar
and rectangular forms.
An important warning is in order: The phasor transform, along with
the inverse phasor transform, allows you to go back and forth between
the time domain and the frequency domain.Therefore, when you obtain
a solution, you are either in the time domain or the frequency domain.
You cannot be in both domains simultaneously. Any solution that con-
tains a mixture of time domain and phasor domain nomenclature is
nonsensical.
The phasor transform is also useful in circuit analysis because it applies
directly to the sum of sinusoidal functions. Circuit analysis involves sum-
ming currents and voltages, so the importance of this observation is obvi-
ous.We can formalize this property as follows: If
(9.23)
where all the voltages on the right-hand side are sinusoidal voltages of the
same frequency, then

Sinusoidal Steady-State Analysis
Thus the phasor representation is the sum of the phasors of the individual
terms.We discuss the development of Eq. 9.24 in Section 9.5.
Before applying the phasor transform to circuit analysis, we illus-
trate its usefulness in solving a problem with which you are already
familiar: adding sinusoidal functions via trigonometric identities.
Example 9.5 shows how the phasor transform greatly simplifies this
type of problem.

9.4 The Passive Circuit Elements 
in the Frequency Domain
The systematic application of the phasor transform in circuit analysis
requires two steps. First, we must establish the relationship between the
phasor current and the phasor voltage at the terminals of the passive cir-
cuit elements. Second, we must develop the phasor-domain version of
Kirchhoff’s laws, which we discuss in Section 9.5. In this section, we estab-
lish the relationship between the phasor current and voltage at the termi-
nals of the resistor, inductor, and capacitor.We begin with the resistor and
use the passive sign convention in all the derivations.
The V-I Relationship for a Resistor
From Ohm’s law, if the current in a resistor varies sinusoidally with time—
that is, if 
—the voltage at the terminals of the resistor,
as shown in Fig. 9.7, is
(9.25)
where 
is the maximum amplitude of the current in amperes and 
is
the phase angle of the current.
The phasor transform of this voltage is

write Eq. 9.26 as

Sinusoidal Steady-State Analysis
which states that the phasor voltage at the terminals of a resistor is simply
the resistance times the phasor current. Figure 9.8 shows the circuit dia-
gram for a resistor in the frequency domain.
Equations 9.25 and 9.27 both contain another important piece of
information—namely, that at the terminals of a resistor, there is no phase
shift between the current and voltage. Figure 9.9 depicts this phase rela-
tionship, where the phase angle of both the voltage and the current wave-
forms is 
The signals are said to be in phase because they both reach
corresponding values on their respective curves at the same time (for
example, they are at their positive maxima at the same instant).
The V-I Relationship for an Inductor
We derive the relationship between the phasor current and phasor voltage
at the terminals of an inductor by assuming a sinusoidal current and using
to establish the corresponding voltage. Thus, for 
the expression for the voltage is
(9.28)
We now rewrite Eq. 9.28 using the cosine function:
(9.29)
The phasor representation of the voltage given by Eq. 9.29 is
(9.30)
Note that in deriving Eq. 9.30 we used the identity
Equation 9.30 states that the phasor voltage at the terminals of an inductor
equals 
times the phasor current. Figure 9.10 shows the frequency-
domain equivalent circuit for the inductor. It is important to note that the
relationship between phasor voltage and phasor current for an inductor
applies as well for the mutual inductance in one coil due to current flowing
in another mutually coupled coil. That is, the phasor voltage at the termi-
nals of one coil in a mutually coupled pair of coils equals 
times the
phasor current in the other coil.

We can rewrite Eq. 9.30 as
(9.31)
which indicates that the voltage and current are out of phase by exactly
In particular, the voltage leads the current by 
or, equivalently, the
current lags behind the voltage by 
. Figure 9.11 illustrates this concept
of voltage leading current or current lagging voltage. For example, the volt-
age reaches its negative peak exactly 
before the current reaches its
negative peak. The same observation can be made with respect to the
zero-going-positive crossing or the positive peak.
We can also express the phase shift in seconds. A phase shift of 
corresponds to one-fourth of a period; hence the voltage leads the current
by 
or 
second.
The V-I Relationship for a Capacitor
We obtain the relationship between the phasor current and phasor voltage
at the terminals of a capacitor from the derivation of Eq. 9.30. In other
words, if we note that for a capacitor that
and assume that
then
(9.32)
Now if we solve Eq. 9.32 for the voltage as a function of the current, we get

Equation 9.33 demonstrates that the equivalent circuit for the capacitor in
the phasor domain is as shown in Fig. 9.12.
The voltage across the terminals of a capacitor lags behind the current
by exactly

minals of a capacitor.
Impedance and Reactance
We conclude this discussion of passive circuit elements in the frequency
domain with an important observation. When we compare Eqs. 9.27, 9.30,
and 9.33, we note that they are all of the form
(9.35)
where Z represents the impedance of the circuit element. Solving for Z in
Eq. 9.35, you can see that impedance is the ratio of a circuit element’s volt-
age phasor to its current phasor.Thus the impedance of a resistor is R, the
impedance of an inductor is 
the impedance of mutual inductance is
and the impedance of a capacitor is 
In all cases, impedance
is measured in ohms. Note that, although impedance is a complex number,
it is not a phasor. Remember, a phasor is a complex number that shows up
as the coefficient of 
Thus, although all phasors are complex numbers,
not all complex numbers are phasors.
Impedance in the frequency domain is the quantity analogous to
resistance, inductance, and capacitance in the time domain.The imaginary
part of the impedance is called reactance. The values of impedance and
reactance for each of the component values are summarized in Table 9.1.
And finally, a reminder. If the reference direction for the current in a
passive circuit element is in the direction of the voltage rise across the ele-
ment, you must insert a minus sign into the equation that relates the volt-
age to the current.

9.5 Kirchhoff’s Laws 
in the Frequency Domain
We pointed out in Section 9.3, with reference to Eqs. 9.23 and 9.24, that the
phasor transform is useful in circuit analysis because it applies to the sum
of sinusoidal functions. We illustrated this usefulness in Example 9.5. We
now formalize this observation by developing Kirchhoff’s laws in the fre-
quency domain.
Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law in the Frequency Domain
We begin by assuming that 
represent voltages around a closed
path in a circuit.We also assume that the circuit is operating in a sinusoidal
steady state.Thus Kirchhoff’s voltage law requires that
(9.36)
which in the sinusoidal steady state becomes complex
(9.37)
We now use Euler’s identity to write Eq. 9.37 as
(9.38)
which we rewrite as
(9.39)
Factoring the term 
from each term yields
or
(9.40)
But 
so
(9.41)
which is the statement of Kirchhoff’s voltage law as it applies to phasor
voltages. In other words, Eq. 9.36 applies to a set of sinusoidal voltages in
the time domain, and Eq. 9.41 is the equivalent statement in the fre-
quency domain.
Kirchhoff’s Current Law in the Frequency Domain
A similar derivation applies to a set of sinusoidal currents.Thus if

Equations 9.35, 9.41, and 9.43 form the basis for circuit analysis in the
frequency domain. Note that Eq. 9.35 has the same algebraic form as Ohm’s
law, and that Eqs. 9.41 and 9.43 state Kirchhoff’s laws for phasor quantities.
Therefore you may use all the techniques developed for analyzing resistive
circuits to find phasor currents and voltages.You need learn no new analytic
techniques; the basic circuit analysis and simplification tools covered in
Chapters 2–4 can all be used to analyze circuits in the frequency domain.
Phasor circuit analysis consists of two fundamental tasks: (1) You must be
able to construct the frequency-domain model of a circuit; and (2) you must
be able to manipulate complex numbers and/or quantities algebraically.We
illustrate these aspects of phasor analysis in the discussion that follows,
beginning with series, parallel, and delta-to-wye simplifications.

9.6 Series, Parallel, and Delta-to-Wye
Simplifications
The rules for combining impedances in series or parallel and for making
delta-to-wye transformations are the same as those for resistors. The only
difference is that combining impedances involves the algebraic manipula-
tion of complex numbers.
Combining Impedances in Series and Parallel
Impedances in series can be combined into a single impedance by simply
adding the individual impedances.The circuit shown in Fig. 9.14 defines the
problem in general terms.The impedances 
are connected in
series between terminals a,b.When impedances are in series, they carry the
same phasor current I. From Eq. 9.35, the voltage drop across each imped-
ance is 
and from Kirchhoff’s voltage law,
(9.44)
The equivalent impedance between terminals a,b is

Impedances connected in parallel may be reduced to a single equiva-

Figure 9.17 depicts the parallel connection of impedances. Note that when
impedances are in parallel, they have the same voltage across their termi-
nals. We derive Eq. 9.46 directly from Fig. 9.17 by simply combining
Kirchhoff’s current law with the phasor-domain version of Ohm’s law, that
is, Eq. 9.35. From Fig. 9.17,
or
(9.47)
Canceling the common voltage term out of Eq. 9.47 reveals Eq. 9.46.
From Eq. 9.46, for the special case of just two impedances in parallel,
(9.48)
We can also express Eq. 9.46 in terms of admittance, defined as the recip-
rocal of impedance and denoted Y.Thus
(9.49)
Admittance is, of course, a complex number, whose real part, G, is called
conductance and whose imaginary part, B, is called susceptance. Like
admittance, conductance and susceptance are measured in siemens (S).
Using Eq. 9.49 in Eq. 9.46, we get
(9.50)
The admittance of each of the ideal passive circuit elements also is
worth noting and is summarized in Table 9.2.

cific circuit.

Delta-to-Wye Transformations
The 
-to-Y transformation that we discussed in Section 3.7 with regard
to resistive circuits also applies to impedances. Figure 9.20 defines the 
-connected impedances along with the Y-equivalent circuit. The 
Y impedances as functions of the 
impedances are
(9.51)
(9.52)

with the Y structure and replace it with an equivalent 
structure. The

cuits. In fact, comparing Eqs. 3.44–3.46 with Eqs. 9.51–9.53, and

Solution
First note that the circuit is not amenable to series
or parallel simplification as it now stands.A -to-Y
impedance transformation allows us to solve for all
the branch currents without resorting to either the
node-voltage or the mesh-current method. If we
replace either the upper delta (abc) or the lower
delta (bcd) with its Y equivalent, we can further
simplify the resulting circuit by series-parallel com-
binations. In deciding which delta to replace, the
sum of the impedances around each delta is worth
checking because this quantity forms the denomi-
nator for the equivalent Y impedances. The sum
around the lower delta is 
so we choose to
eliminate it from the circuit. The Y impedance con-
necting to terminal b is
the Y impedance connecting to terminal c is

9.7 Source Transformations and
Thévenin-Norton Equivalent Circuits
The source transformations introduced in Section 4.9 and the Thévenin-
Norton equivalent circuits discussed in Section 4.10 are analytical tech-
niques that also can be applied to frequency-domain circuits. We prove
the validity of these techniques by following the same process used in
Sections 4.9 and 4.10, except that we substitute impedance (Z) for resist-
ance (R). Figure 9.24 shows a source-transformation equivalent circuit
with the nomenclature of the frequency domain.
Figure 9.25 illustrates the frequency-domain version of a Thévenin
equivalent circuit. Figure 9.26 shows the frequency-domain equivalent of
a Norton equivalent circuit. The techniques for finding the Thévenin
equivalent voltage and impedance are identical to those used for resistive
circuits, except that the frequency-domain equivalent circuit involves the
manipulation of complex quantities. The same holds for finding the
Norton equivalent current and impedance.
Example 9.9 demonstrates the application of the source-transformation
equivalent circuit to frequency-domain analysis. Example 9.10 illustrates
the details of finding a Thévenin equivalent circuit in the frequency domain.

use any of the techniques previously used to find
the Thévenin resistance. We illustrate the test-
source method in this example. Recall that in
using this method, we deactivate all independent
sources from the circuit and then apply either a
test voltage source or a test current source to the
terminals of interest. The ratio of the voltage to
the current at the source is the Thévenin imped-
ance. Figure 9.32 shows the result of applying this
technique to the circuit shown in Fig. 9.30. Note
that we chose a test voltage source

9.8 The Node-Voltage Method
In Sections 4.2–4.4, we introduced the basic concepts of the node-voltage
method of circuit analysis. The same concepts apply when we use the
node-voltage method to analyze frequency-domain circuits. Example 9.11
illustrates the solution of such a circuit by the node-voltage technique.
Assessment Problem 9.12 and many of the Chapter Problems give you an
opportunity to use the node-voltage method to solve for steady-state sinu-
soidal responses.

Using the Node-Voltage Method in the Frequency Domain
Use the node-voltage method to find the branch
currents 
and 
in the circuit shown in Fig. 9.34.
Figure 9.34  The circuit for Example 9.11.
Solution
We can describe the circuit in terms of two node volt-
ages because it contains three essential nodes. Four
branches terminate at the essential node that stretches
across the bottom of Fig.9.34,so we use it as the refer-
ence node. The remaining two essential nodes are
labeled 1 and 2,and the appropriate node voltages are
designated 
and 
Figure 9.35 reflects the choice
of reference node and the terminal labels.

9.10 The Transformer
A transformer is a device that is based on magnetic coupling. Transformers
are used in both communication and power circuits. In communication cir-
cuits, the transformer is used to match impedances and eliminate dc signals
from portions of the system.In power circuits,transformers are used to estab-
lish ac voltage levels that facilitate the transmission, distribution, and con-
sumption of electrical power. A knowledge of the sinusoidal steady-state

The Transformer

behavior of the transformer is required in the analysis of both communication
and power systems. In this section, we will discuss the sinusoidal steady-state
behavior of the linear transformer, which is found primarily in communica-
tion circuits. In Section 9.11, we will deal with the ideal transformer, which is
used to model the ferromagnetic transformer found in power systems.
Before starting we make a useful observation. When analyzing circuits
containing mutual inductance use the meshor loop-current method for writ-
ing circuit equations.The node-voltage method is cumbersome to use when
mutual inductance in involved. This is because the currents in the various
coils cannot be written by inspection as functions of the node voltages.
The Analysis of a Linear Transformer Circuit
A simple transformer is formed when two coils are wound on a single core
to ensure magnetic coupling. Figure 9.38 shows the frequency-domain cir-
cuit model of a system that uses a transformer to connect a load to a
source. In discussing this circuit, we refer to the transformer winding con-
nected to the source as the primary winding and the winding connected to
the load as the secondary winding. Based on this terminology, the trans-
former circuit parameters are
The internal voltage of the sinusoidal source is 
and the internal
impedance of the source is 
The impedance 
represents the load con-
nected to the secondary winding of the transformer. The phasor currents
and 
represent the primary and secondary currents of the transformer,
respectively.
Analysis of the circuit in Fig. 9.38 consists of finding 
and 
as func-
tions of the circuit parameters 
M,
and 
We are
also interested in finding the impedance seen looking into the transformer
from the terminals a,b. To find 
and 
we first write the two mesh-cur-
rent equations that describe the circuit:
(9.57)
(9.58)
To facilitate the algebraic manipulation of Eqs. 9.57 and 9.58, we let
(9.59)
(9.60)
where 
is the total self-impedance of the mesh containing the primary
winding of the transformer, and 
is the total self-impedance of the
mesh containing the secondary winding. Based on the notation introduced
in Eqs. 9.59 and 9.60, the solutions for 
and 
from Eqs. 9.57 and 9.58 are

Sinusoidal Steady-State Analysis
To the internal source voltage 
the impedance appears as 
or
(9.63)
The impedance at the terminals of the source is 
so
(9.64)
Note that the impedance 
is independent of the magnetic polarity
of the transformer. The reason is that the mutual inductance appears in
Eq. 9.64 as a squared quantity. This impedance is of particular interest
because it shows how the transformer affects the impedance of the load as
seen from the source. Without the transformer, the load would be con-
nected directly to the source, and the source would see a load impedance
of 
with the transformer, the load is connected to the source through
the transformer, and the source sees a load impedance that is a modified
version of 
as seen in the third term of Eq. 9.64.
Reflected Impedance
The third term in Eq. 9.64 is called the reflected impedance (
), because
it is the equivalent impedance of the secondary coil and load impedance
transmitted, or reflected, to the primary side of the transformer. Note that
the reflected impedance is due solely to the existence of mutual induc-
tance; that is, if the two coils are decoupled, M becomes zero,
becomes
zero, and 
reduces to the self-impedance of the primary coil.
To consider reflected impedance in more detail, we first express the
load impedance in rectangular form:
(9.65)
where the load reactance 
carries its own algebraic sign. In other words,
is a positive number if the load is inductive and a negative number if
the load is capacitive. We now use Eq. 9.65 to write the reflected imped-
ance in rectangular form:
(9.66)
The derivation of Eq. 9.66 takes advantage of the fact that, when 
is
written in rectangular form, the self-impedance of the mesh containing the
secondary winding is
(9.67)
Now observe from Eq. 9.66 that the self-impedance of the secondary
circuit is reflected into the primary circuit by a scaling factor of
and that the sign of the reactive component 
is
reversed. Thus the linear transformer reflects the conjugate of the self-
impedance of the secondary circuit 
into the primary winding by a
scalar multiplier. Example 9.13 illustrates mesh current analysis for a cir-
cuit containing a linear transformer.

9.11 The Ideal Transformer
An ideal transformer consists of two magnetically coupled coils having 
and 
turns, respectively, and exhibiting these three properties:
1. The coefficient of coupling is unity 
2. The self-inductance of each coil is infinite 
3. The coil losses, due to parasitic resistance, are negligible.
Understanding the behavior of ideal transformers begins with Eq. 9.64
which describes the impedance at the terminals of a source connected to a
linear transformer.We repeat this equation below and examine it further.
Exploring Limiting Values
A useful relationship between the input impedance and load impedance,
as given by 
in Eq. 9.68, emerges as 
and 
each become infinitely
large and, at the same time, the coefficient of coupling approaches unity:

The Thévenin impedance will be equal to the imped-
ance of the secondary winding plus the impedance
reflected from the primary when the voltage source is
replaced by a short-circuit.Thus

The Ideal Transformer
337
Transformers wound on ferromagnetic cores can approach this condition.
Even though such transformers are nonlinear, we can obtain some useful
information by constructing an ideal model that ignores the nonlinearities.
To show how 
changes when 
and 
and 
approach infin-
ity, we first introduce the notation
and then rearrange Eq. 9.68:
(9.69)
At this point, we must be careful with the coefficient of j in Eq. 9.69
because, as 
and 
approach infinity, this coefficient is the difference
between two large quantities. Thus, before letting 
and 
increase, we
write the coefficient as
(9.70)
where we recognize that, when 
Putting the term mul-
tiplying 
over a common denominator gives
(9.71)
Factoring 
out of the numerator and denominator of Eq. 9.71 yields
(9.72)
As k approaches 1.0, the ratio 
approaches the constant value of
which follows from Eqs. 6.54 and 6.55. The reason is that, as the
coupling becomes extremely tight, the two permeances 
and 
become
equal. Equation 9.72 then reduces to
(9.73)
as 
and 
The same reasoning leads to simplification of the reflected resistance
in Eq. 9.69:
(9.74)
Applying the results given by Eqs. 9.73 and 9.74 to Eq. 9.69 yields
(9.75)
Compare this result with the result in Eq. 9.68. Here we see that when the
coefficient of coupling approaches unity and the self-inductances of the
coupled coils approach infinity, the transformer reflects the secondary
winding resistance and the load impedance to the primary side by a scaling

Sinusoidal Steady-State Analysis
factor equal to the turns ratio 
squared. Hence we may describe the
terminal behavior of the ideal transformer in terms of two characteristics.
First, the magnitude of the volts per turn is the same for each coil, or
(9.76)
Second, the magnitude of the ampere-turns is the same for each coil, or
(9.77)
We are forced to use magnitude signs in Eqs. 9.76 and 9.77, because we
have not yet established reference polarities for the currents and voltages;
we discuss the removal of the magnitude signs shortly.
Figure 9.41 shows two lossless 
magnetically coupled
coils.We use Fig. 9.41 to validate Eqs. 9.76 and 9.77. In Fig. 9.41(a), coil 2 is
open; in Fig. 9.41(b), coil 2 is shorted.Although we carry out the following
analysis in terms of sinusoidal steady-state operation, the results also
apply to instantaneous values of 
and i.
Determining the Voltage and Current Ratios
Note in Fig. 9.41(a) that the voltage at the terminals of the open-circuit
coil is entirely the result of the current in coil 1; therefore
(9.78)
The current in coil 1 is
(9.79)
From Eqs. 9.78 and 9.79,
(9.80)
For unity coupling, the mutual inductance equals 
so Eq. 9.80
becomes
(9.81)
For unity coupling, the flux linking coil 1 is the same as the flux linking
coil 2, so we need only one permeance to describe the self-inductance of
each coil.Thus Eq. 9.81 becomes
(9.82)
or

Figure 9.42 shows the graphic symbol for an ideal transformer. The
vertical lines in the symbol represent the layers of magnetic material from
which ferromagnetic cores are often made. Thus, the symbol reminds us
that coils wound on a ferromagnetic core behave very much like an ideal
transformer.
There are several reasons for this.The ferromagnetic material creates
a space with high permeance. Thus most of the magnetic flux is trapped
inside the core material, establishing tight magnetic coupling between
coils that share the same core. High permeance also means high self-
inductance, because 
Finally, ferromagnetically coupled coils
efficiently transfer power from one coil to the other. Efficiencies in excess
of 95% are common, so neglecting losses is not a crippling approximation
for many applications.
Determining the Polarity of the Voltage 
and Current Ratios
We now turn to the removal of the magnitude signs from Eqs. 9.76 and
9.77. Note that magnitude signs did not show up in the derivations of
Eqs. 9.83 and 9.86.We did not need them there because we had established
reference polarities for voltages and reference directions for currents. In
addition, we knew the magnetic polarity dots of the two coupled coils.
The rules for assigning the proper algebraic sign to Eqs. 9.76 and 9.77
are as follows:
If the coil voltages 
and 
are both positive or negative at the dot-
marked terminal, use a plus sign in Eq. 9.76. Otherwise, use a nega-
tive sign.
If the coil currents 
and 
are both directed into or out of the dot-
marked terminal, use a minus sign in Eq. 9.77. Otherwise, use a 
plus sign.
The four circuits shown in Fig. 9.43 illustrate these rules.

The Use of an Ideal Transformer for Impedance Matching
Ideal transformers can also be used to raise or lower the impedance level
of a load.The circuit shown in Fig. 9.47 illustrates this.The impedance seen
by the practical voltage source (
in series with 
) is 
The voltage
and current at the terminals of the load impedance (
and 
) are related

and
(9.89)
Therefore the impedance seen by the practical source is
(9.90)
but the ratio 
is the load impedance 
so Eq. 9.90 becomes
(9.91)
Thus, the ideal transformer’s secondary coil reflects the load impedance
back to the primary coil, with the scaling factor 
Note that the ideal transformer changes the magnitude of 
but does
not affect its phase angle. Whether 
is greater or less than 
depends
on the turns ratio a.

netic core transformer—can be used to match the magnitude of

As we shall see, ideal transformers are used to increase or decrease
voltages from a source to a load. Thus, ideal transformers are used widely
in the electric utility industry, where it is desirable to decrease, or step
down, the voltage level at the power line to safer residential voltage levels.

9.12 Phasor Diagrams
When we are using the phasor method to analyze the steady-state sinu-
soidal operation of a circuit, a diagram of the phasor currents and voltages
may give further insight into the behavior of the circuit.A phasor diagram
shows the magnitude and phase angle of each phasor quantity in the
complex-number plane. Phase angles are measured counterclockwise from
the positive real axis, and magnitudes are measured from the origin of the
axes. For example, Fig. 9.48 shows the phasor quantities 
and 
Constructing phasor diagrams of circuit quantities generally involves
both currents and voltages. As a result, two different magnitude scales are
necessary,one for currents and one for voltages.The ability to visualize a pha-
sor quantity on the complex-number plane can be useful when you are check-
ing pocket calculator calculations.The typical pocket calculator doesn’t offer
a printout of the data entered.But when the calculated angle is displayed,you
can compare it to your mental image as a check on whether you keyed in the
appropriate values. For example, suppose that you are to compute the polar
form of 
Without making any calculations, you should anticipate a
magnitude greater than 7 and an angle in the third quadrant that is more neg-
ative than 
or less positive than 
as illustrated in Fig. 9.49.
Examples 9.15 and 9.16 illustrate the construction and use of phasor
diagrams. We use such diagrams in subsequent chapters whenever they
give additional insight into the steady-state sinusoidal operation of the cir-
cuit under investigation. Problem 9.84 shows how a phasor diagram can
help explain the operation of a phase-shifting circuit.

Phasor Diagrams

The circuit in Fig. 9.52 has a load consisting of the
parallel combination of the resistor and inductor.
Use phasor diagrams to explore the effect of
adding a capacitor across the terminals of the load
on the amplitude of 
if we adjust 
so that the
amplitude of 
remains constant. Utility compa-
nies use this technique to control the voltage drop
on their lines.
Figure 9.52  The circuit for Example 9.16.
Solution
We begin by assuming zero capacitance across the
load. After constructing the phasor diagram for the
zero-capacitance case, we can add the capacitor and
study its effect on the amplitude of 
holding the
amplitude of 
constant. Figure 9.53 shows the fre-
quency-domain equivalent of the circuit shown in
Fig. 9.52.We added the phasor branch currents I,
and 
to Fig. 9.53 to aid discussion.
Figure 9.53  The frequency-domain equivalent of the circuit
in Fig. 9.52.
Figure 9.54 shows the stepwise evolution of
the phasor diagram. Keep in mind that we are not
interested in specific phasor values and positions
in this example, but rather in the general effect of
adding a capacitor across the terminals of the
load. Thus, we want to develop the relative posi-
tions of the phasors before and after the capacitor
has been added.
Relating the phasor diagram to the circuit
shown in Fig. 9.53 reveals the following points:
a) Because we are holding the amplitude of the load
voltage constant, we choose 
as our reference.

Sinusoidal Steady-State Analysis
in Fig. 9.57 depicts these observations. The dotted
phasors represent the pertinent currents and volt-
ages before the addition of the capacitor.
Thus, comparing the dotted phasors of I,
and 
with their solid counterparts clearly
shows the effect of adding C to the circuit. In par-
ticular, note that this reduces the amplitude of the
source voltage and still maintains the amplitude of
the load voltage. Practically, this result means that,
as the load increases (i.e., as 
and 
increase), we
can add capacitors to the system (i.e., increase 
)
so that under heavy load conditions we can main-
tain 
without increasing the amplitude of the
source voltage.

Practical Perspective
A Household Distribution Circuit
Let us return to the household distribution circuit introduced at the begin-
ning of the chapter. We will modify the circuit slightly by adding resistance
to each conductor on the secondary side of the transformer to simulate more
accurately the residential wiring conductors. The modified circuit is shown
in Fig. 9.58. In Problem 9.88 you will calculate the six branch currents on
the secondary side of the distribution transformer and then show how to
calculate the current in the primary winding.
NOTE: Assess your understanding of this Practical Perspective by trying Chapter

Summary
•
The general equation for a sinusoidal source is
or
where 
(or 
) is the maximum amplitude,
is the
frequency, and 
is the phase angle. (See page 306.)
•
The frequency,
, of a sinusoidal response is the same as
the frequency of the sinusoidal source driving the circuit.
The amplitude and phase angle of the response are usu-
ally different from those of the source. (See page 309.)
•
The best way to find the steady-state voltages and cur-
rents in a circuit driven by sinusoidal sources is to per-
form the analysis in the frequency domain.The following
mathematical transforms allow us to move between the
time and frequency domains.
•
The phasor transform (from the time domain to the
frequency domain):
•
The inverse phasor transform (from the frequency
domain to the time domain):
(See pages 310–311.)
•
When working with sinusoidally varying signals,
remember that voltage leads current by 90° at the ter-
minals of an inductor, and current leads voltage by 90°
at the terminals of a capacitor. (See pages 315–318.)
•
Impedance (Z) plays the same role in the frequency
domain as resistance, inductance, and capacitance play
in the time domain. Specifically, the relationship
between phasor current and phasor voltage for resis-
tors, inductors, and capacitors is
V = ZI,
p-15Vmejf = t5Vmejfejvt6.
V = Vmejf = p5Vm cos(vt + f)6.
v
f
v
Im
Vm
 i = Im cos(vt + f) (current source),
 v = Vm cos(vt + f) (voltage source),
where the reference direction for I obeys the passive
sign convention. The reciprocal of impedance is
admittance (Y), so another way to express the current-
voltage relationship for resistors, inductors, and capaci-
tors in the frequency domain is
(See pages 318 and 322.)
•
All of the circuit analysis techniques developed in
Chapters 2–4 for resistive circuits also apply to sinu-
soidal steady-state circuits in the frequency domain.
These techniques include KVL, KCL, series, and paral-
lel combinations of impedances, voltage and current
division, node voltage and mesh current methods,
source transformations and Thévenin and Norton
equivalents.
•
The two-winding linear transformer is a coupling device
made up of two coils wound on the same nonmagnetic
core. Reflected impedance is the impedance of the sec-
ondary circuit as seen from the terminals of the primary
circuit or vice versa.The reflected impedance of a linear
transformer seen from the primary side is the conjugate
of the self-impedance of the secondary circuit scaled by
the factor 
. (See pages 333 and 334.)
•
The two-winding ideal transformer is a linear trans-
former with the following special properties: perfect
coupling (
), infinite self-inductance in each coil
(
), and lossless coils (
). The
circuit behavior is governed by the turns ratio 
In particular, the volts per turn is the same for each
winding, or
and the ampere turns are the same for each winding, or

9.10 a) Verify that Eq. 9.9 is the solution of Eq. 9.8.This
can be done by substituting Eq. 9.9 into the left-
hand side of Eq. 9.8 and then noting that it
equals the right-hand side for all values of 
At 
Eq. 9.9 should reduce to the initial
value of the current.
b) Because the transient component vanishes as
time elapses and because our solution must sat-
isfy the differential equation for all values of t,
the steady-state component, by itself, must also
satisfy the differential equation. Verify this
observation by showing that the steady-state
component of Eq. 9.9 satisfies Eq. 9.8.

9.86 You may have the opportunity as an engineering
graduate to serve as an expert witness in lawsuits
involving either personal injury or property damage.
As an example of the type of problem on which you
may be asked to give an opinion, consider the follow-
ing event. At the end of a day of fieldwork, a farmer
returns to his farmstead, checks his hog confinement
building, and finds to his dismay that the hogs are
dead. The problem is traced to a blown fuse that
caused a 240 V fan motor to stop.The loss of ventila-
tion led to the suffocation of the livestock.The inter-
rupted fuse is located in the main switch that
connects the farmstead to the electrical service.
Before the insurance company settles the claim, it
wants to know if the electric circuit supplying the
farmstead functioned properly. The lawyers for the
insurance company are puzzled because the farmer’s
wife, who was in the house on the day of the accident
convalescing from minor surgery, was able to watch
TV during the afternoon. Furthermore, when she
went to the kitchen to start preparing the evening
meal,the electric clock indicated the correct time.The
lawyers have hired you to explain (1) why the electric
clock in the kitchen and the television set in the living
room continued to operate after the fuse in the main
switch blew and (2) why the second fuse in the main
switch didn’t blow after the fan motor stalled.After
ascertaining the loads on the three-wire distribu-
tion circuit prior to the interruption of fuse A, you
are able to construct the circuit model shown in
Fig. P9.86. The impedances of the line conductors
and the neutral conductor are assumed negligible.
a) Calculate the branch currents 
and 
prior to the interruption of fuse A.
b) Calculate the branch currents after the interrup-
tion of fuse A. Assume the stalled fan motor
behaves as a short circuit.
c) Explain why the clock and television set were
not affected by the momentary short circuit that
interrupted fuse A.
d) Assume the fan motor is equipped with a ther-
mal cutout designed to interrupt the motor

circuit if the motor current becomes excessive.
Would you expect the thermal cutout to oper-
ate? Explain.
e) Explain why fuse B is not interrupted when the
fan motor stalls.
9.87 a) Calculate the branch currents
in the cir-
cuit in Fig. 9.58.
b) Find the primary current 
9.88 Suppose the 
resistance in the distribution cir-
cuit in Fig. 9.58 is replaced by a 
resistance.
a) Recalculate the branch current in the 
resistor,
b) Recalculate the primary current,
c) On the basis of your answers, is it desirable 
to have the resistance of the two 120 V loads 
be equal?
9.89 A residential wiring circuit is shown in Fig. P9.89. In
this model, the resistor 
is used to model a 250 V
appliance (such as an electric range), and the resis-
tors 
and 
are used to model 125 V appliances
(such as a lamp, toaster, and iron). The branches
carrying 
and 
are modeling what electricians
refer to as the hot conductors in the circuit, and the
branch carrying 
is modeling the neutral conduc-
tor. Our purpose in analyzing the circuit is to show
the importance of the neutral conductor in the sat-
isfactory operation of the circuit.You are to choose
the method for analyzing the circuit.

b) Show that

c) Open the neutral branch and calculate

d) Close the neutral branch and repeat (c).

tors are energized.

dealing with the delivery of energy to do work is considerable,
from determining the power rating within which an appliance
operates safely and efficiently, to designing the vast array of gen-
erators, transformers, and wires that provide electric energy to
household and industrial consumers.
Nearly all electric energy is supplied in the form of sinusoidal
voltages and currents. Thus, after our Chapter 9 discussion of
sinusoidal circuits, this is the logical place to consider sinusoidal
steady-state power calculations. We are primarily interested in
the average power delivered to or supplied from a pair of termi-
nals as a result of sinusoidal voltages and currents. Other meas-
ures, such as reactive power, complex power, and apparent
power, will also be presented. The concept of the rms value of a
sinusoid, briefly introduced in Chapter 9, is particularly pertinent
to power calculations.
We begin and end this chapter with two concepts that should
be very familiar to you from previous chapters: the basic equa-
tion for power (Section 10.1) and maximum power transfer
(Section 10.6). In between, we discuss the general processes for
analyzing power, which will be familiar from your studies in
Chapters 1 and 4, although some additional mathematical tech-
niques are required here to deal with sinusoidal, rather than dc,
signals.

In Chapter 9 we calculated the steady-state voltages and cur-
rents in electric circuits driven by sinusoidal sources. In this
chapter we consider power in these circuits. The techniques
we develop are useful for analyzing many of the electrical
devices we encounter daily, because sinusoidal sources are
the predominant means of providing electric power.
Even when we are not using many of the common electri-
cal devices found in our homes, schools, and businesses, they
may still be consuming power. This “standby power” may be
used to run an internal clock, charge batteries, display time or
other quantities, monitor temperature or other environmental
measures, or search for signals to receive. Devices such as
microwave ovens, DVRs, televisions, remote controls, and com-
puters all consume power when not in use.
The ac adapters used to charge many portable devices are
a common source of standby power. Even when the device is
unplugged from the adapter, the adapter may continue to
consume power if it is plugged into the wall outlet. The plug
on the adapter looks like vampire fangs, so this standby
power became known as “vampire power.” It is power that is
used even while we sleep.
How much vampire power is used by the electrical devices
in our home over the course of a year? Is there a way to
reduce or eliminate vampire power? These questions will be
explored in the Practical Perspective example at the end of
the chapter, and in the chapter problems.

10.1 Instantaneous Power
We begin our investigation of sinusoidal power calculations with the
familiar circuit in Fig. 10.1. Here,
and i are steady-state sinusoidal signals.
Using the passive sign convention, the power at any instant of time is
(10.1)
This is instantaneous power. Remember that if the reference direction of
the current is in the direction of the voltage rise, Eq. 10.1 must be written
with a minus sign. Instantaneous power is measured in watts when the
voltage is in volts and the current is in amperes. First, we write expressions
for 
and i:
(10.2)
(10.3)
where 
is the voltage phase angle, and 
is the current phase angle.
We are operating in the sinusoidal steady state, so we may choose any
convenient reference for zero time. Engineers designing systems that
transfer large blocks of power have found it convenient to use a zero time
corresponding to the instant the current is passing through a positive max-
imum. This reference system requires a shift of both the voltage and cur-
rent by 
Thus Eqs. 10.2 and 10.3 become
(10.4)
(10.5)
When we substitute Eqs. 10.4 and 10.5 into Eq. 10.1, the expression for the
instantaneous power becomes
(10.6)
We could use Eq. 10.6 directly to find the average power; however, by sim-
ply applying a couple of trigonometric identities, we can put Eq. 10.6 into
a much more informative form.
We begin with the trigonometric identity1
to expand Eq. 10.6; letting 
and 
gives

to expand the second term on the right-hand side of Eq. 10.7, which gives
(10.8)
Figure 10.2 depicts a representative relationship among , i, and p,
based on the assumptions 
and 
You can see that the fre-
quency of the instantaneous power is twice the frequency of the voltage or
current. This observation also follows directly from the second two terms
on the right-hand side of Eq. 10.8. Therefore, the instantaneous power
goes through two complete cycles for every cycle of either the voltage or
the current.Also note that the instantaneous power may be negative for a
portion of each cycle, even if the network between the terminals is passive.
In a completely passive network, negative power implies that energy
stored in the inductors or capacitors is now being extracted. The fact that
the instantaneous power varies with time in the sinusoidal steady-state
operation of a circuit explains why some motor-driven appliances (such as
refrigerators) experience vibration and require resilient motor mountings
to prevent excessive vibration.
We are now ready to use Eq. 10.8 to find the average power at the ter-
minals of the circuit represented by Fig. 10.1 and, at the same time, intro-
duce the concept of reactive power.

10.2 Average and Reactive Power
We begin by noting that Eq. 10.8 has three terms, which we can rewrite as
follows:
(10.9)
p = P + P cos 2vt - Q sin 2vt,

362
Sinusoidal Steady-State Power Calculations
Average (real) power 
where
(10.10)
(10.11)
P is called the average power, and Q is called the reactive power.Average
power is sometimes called real power, because it describes the power in a
circuit that is transformed from electric to nonelectric energy. Although
the two terms are interchangeable, we primarily use the term average
power in this text.
It is easy to see why P is called the average power.The average power
associated with sinusoidal signals is the average of the instantaneous
power over one period, or, in equation form,
(10.12)
where T is the period of the sinusoidal function. The limits on Eq. 10.12
imply that we can initiate the integration process at any convenient time 
but that we must terminate the integration exactly one period later. (We
could integrate over nT periods, where n is an integer, provided we multi-
ply the integral by 
)
We could find the average power by substituting Eq. 10.9 directly into
Eq. 10.12 and then performing the integration. But note that the average
value of p is given by the first term on the right-hand side of Eq. 10.9,
because the integral of both 
and 
over one period is zero.
Thus the average power is given in Eq. 10.10.
We can develop a better understanding of all the terms in Eq. 10.9 and
the relationships among them by examining the power in circuits that are
purely resistive, purely inductive, or purely capacitive.
Power for Purely Resistive Circuits
If the circuit between the terminals is purely resistive, the voltage and cur-
rent are in phase, which means that 
Equation 10.9 then reduces to
(10.13)
The instantaneous power expressed in Eq. 10.13 is referred to as the
instantaneous real power. Figure 10.3 shows a graph of Eq. 10.13 for a
representative purely resistive circuit, assuming 
By defini-
tion, the average power, P, is the average of p over one period. Thus it is
easy to see just by looking at the graph that 
for this circuit. Note
from Eq. 10.13 that the instantaneous real power can never be negative,
which is also shown in Fig. 10.3. In other words, power cannot be extracted
from a purely resistive network. Rather, all the electric energy is dissi-
pated in the form of thermal energy.
Power for Purely Inductive Circuits
If the circuit between the terminals is purely inductive, the voltage and
current are out of phase by precisely 
. In particular, the current lags the
voltage by 
(that is,
therefore 
The
expression for the instantaneous power then reduces to

10.2
Average and Reactive Power
363
In a purely inductive circuit, the average power is zero. Therefore no
transformation of energy from electric to nonelectric form takes place.
The instantaneous power at the terminals in a purely inductive circuit is
continually exchanged between the circuit and the source driving the cir-
cuit, at a frequency of 
In other words, when p is positive, energy is
being stored in the magnetic fields associated with the inductive elements,
and when p is negative, energy is being extracted from the magnetic fields.
A measure of the power associated with purely inductive circuits is
the reactive power Q.The name reactive power comes from the character-
ization of an inductor as a reactive element; its impedance is purely reac-
tive. Note that average power P and reactive power Q carry the same
dimension.To distinguish between average and reactive power, we use the
units watt (W) for average power and var (volt-amp reactive, or VAR) for
reactive power. Figure 10.4 plots the instantaneous power for a represen-
tative purely inductive circuit, assuming 
and 
Power for Purely Capacitive Circuits
If the circuit between the terminals is purely capacitive, the voltage and
current are precisely 
out of phase. In this case, the current leads the
voltage by 
(that is,
); thus,
The expres-
sion for the instantaneous power then becomes
(10.15)
Again, the average power is zero, so there is no transformation of energy
from electric to nonelectric form. In a purely capacitive circuit, the power
is continually exchanged between the source driving the circuit and the
electric field associated with the capacitive elements. Figure 10.5 plots the
instantaneous power for a representative purely capacitive circuit, assum-
ing 
and 
Note that the decision to use the current as the reference leads to Q
being positive for inductors (that is,
and negative for capac-
itors (that is,
. Power engineers recognize this difference in
the algebraic sign of Q by saying that inductors demand (or absorb) mag-
netizing vars, and capacitors furnish (or deliver) magnetizing vars. We say
more about this convention later.
The Power Factor
The angle 
plays a role in the computation of both average and
reactive power and is referred to as the power factor angle. The cosine of
this angle is called the power factor, abbreviated pf, and the sine of this
angle is called the reactive factor, abbreviated rf.Thus
(10.16)
(10.17)
Knowing the value of the power factor does not tell you the value of the
power factor angle, because 
To completely
describe this angle, we use the descriptive phrases lagging power factor and
leading power factor. Lagging power factor implies that current lags volt-
age—hence an inductive load. Leading power factor implies that current
leads voltage—hence a capacitive load. Both the power factor and the reac-
tive factor are convenient quantities to use in describing electrical loads.
Example 10.1 illustrates the interpretation of P and Q on the basis of
a numerical calculation.

Appliance Ratings
Average power is used to quantify the power needs of household appliances.
The average power rating and estimated annual kilowatt-hour consumption
of some common appliances are presented in Table 10.1. The energy con-
sumption values are obtained by estimating the number of hours annually
that the appliances are in use. For example, a coffeemaker has an estimated
annual consumption of 140 kWh and an average power consumption during
operation of 1.2 kW.Therefore a coffeemaker is assumed to be in operation
or 116.67, hours per year, or approximately 19 minutes per day.
Example 10.2 uses Table 10.1 to determine whether four common
appliances can all be in operation without exceeding the current-carrying
capacity of the household.

10.3 The rms Value and Power
Calculations
In introducing the rms value of a sinusoidal voltage (or current) in
Section 9.1, we mentioned that it would play an important role in power
calculations.We can now discuss this role.
Assume that a sinusoidal voltage is applied to the terminals of a resis-
tor, as shown in Fig. 10.7, and that we want to determine the average
power delivered to the resistor. From Eq. 10.12,
(10.18)
Comparing Eq. 10.18 with Eq. 9.5 reveals that the average power deliv-
ered to R is simply the rms value of the voltage squared divided by R, or
(10.19)
If the resistor is carrying a sinusoidal current, say,
the
average power delivered to the resistor is
(10.20)
The rms value is also referred to as the effective value of the sinu-
soidal voltage (or current). The rms value has an interesting property:
Given an equivalent resistive load, R, and an equivalent time period, T,
the rms value of a sinusoidal source delivers the same energy to R as does
a dc source of the same value. For example, a dc source of 100 V delivers
the same energy in T seconds that a sinusoidal source of 100 
delivers,
assuming equivalent load resistances (see Problem 10.12). Figure 10.8
demonstrates this equivalence. Energywise, the effect of the two sources
is identical. This has led to the term effective value being used inter-
changeably with rms value.
The average power given by Eq. 10.10 and the reactive power given
by Eq. 10.11 can be written in terms of effective values:

The rms Value and Power Calculations
367
and, by similar manipulation,
(10.22)
The effective value of the sinusoidal signal in power calculations is so
widely used that voltage and current ratings of circuits and equipment
involved in power utilization are given in terms of rms values. For exam-
ple, the voltage rating of residential electric wiring is often 
service. These voltage levels are the rms values of the sinusoidal voltages
supplied by the utility company, which provides power at two voltage lev-
els to accommodate low-voltage appliances (such as televisions) and
higher voltage appliances (such as electric ranges). Appliances such as
electric lamps, irons, and toasters all carry rms ratings on their nameplates.
For example, a 120 V, 100 W lamp has a resistance of 
or 
and draws an rms current of 
or 0.833 A. The peak value of the
lamp current is 
or 1.18 A.
The phasor transform of a sinusoidal function may also be expressed
in terms of the rms value.The magnitude of the rms phasor is equal to the
rms value of the sinusoidal function. If a phasor is based on the rms value,
we indicate this by either an explicit statement, a parenthetical “rms” adja-
cent to the phasor quantity, or the subscript “eff,” as in Eq. 10.21.
In Example 10.3,we illustrate the use of rms values for calculating power.

10.4 Complex Power
Before proceeding to the various methods of calculating real and reactive
power in circuits operating in the sinusoidal steady state, we need to intro-
duce and define complex power. Complex power is the complex sum of
real power and reactive power, or
(10.23)
As you will see, we can compute the complex power directly from the volt-
age and current phasors for a circuit. Equation 10.23 can then be used to
compute the average power and the reactive power, because 
and 
Dimensionally, complex power is the same as average or reactive
power. However, to distinguish complex power from either average or
reactive power, we use the units volt-amps (VA).Thus we use volt-amps for
complex power, watts for average power, and vars for reactive power, as
summarized in Table 10.2.
Another advantage of using complex power is the geometric interpre-
tation it provides. When working with Eq. 10.23, think of P, Q, and 
as
the sides of a right triangle, as shown in Fig. 10.9. It is easy to show that the
angle 
in the power triangle is the power factor angle 
For the
right triangle shown in Fig. 10.9,
(10.24)
But from the definitions of P and Q (Eqs. [10.10] and [10.11], respectively),
(10.25)
Therefore,
The geometric relations for a right triangle mean
also that the four power triangle dimensions (the three sides and the
power factor angle) can be determined if any two of the four are known.
The magnitude of complex power is referred to as apparent power.
Specifically,
(10.26)
Apparent power, like complex power, is measured in volt-amps. The
apparent power, or volt-amp, requirement of a device designed to convert
electric energy to a nonelectric form is more important than the average
power requirement. Although the average power represents the useful
output of the energy-converting device, the apparent power represents the
volt-amp capacity required to supply the average power. As you can see
from the power triangle in Fig. 10.9, unless the power factor angle is 
(that is, the device is purely resistive,
and 
), the volt-amp
capacity required by the device is larger than the average power used by
the device. As we will see in Example 10.6, it makes sense to operate
devices at a power factor close to 1.
Many useful appliances (such as refrigerators, fans, air conditioners,
fluorescent lighting fixtures, and washing machines) and most industrial
loads operate at a lagging power factor. The power factor of these loads
sometimes is corrected either by adding a capacitor to the device itself or

by connecting capacitors across the line feeding the load; the latter
method is often used for large industrial loads. Many of the Chapter
Problems give you a chance to make some calculations that correct a lag-
ging power factor load and improve the operation of a circuit.
Example 10.4 uses a power triangle to calculate several quantities
associated with an electrical load.
Example 10.4
Calculating Complex Power
An electrical load operates at 240 V rms. The load
absorbs an average power of 8 kW at a lagging
power factor of 0.8.
a) Calculate the complex power of the load.
b) Calculate the impedance of the load.
Solution
a) The power factor is described as lagging, so we
know that the load is inductive and that the
algebraic sign of the reactive power is positive.
From the power triangle shown in Fig. 10.10,
Now,
because 
Therefore

the load, we see that

ance, because it is the power factor angle:
We also know that 
is positive because the
power factor is lagging, indicating an inductive
load. We compute the magnitude of the load
impedance from its definition as the ratio of the
magnitude of the voltage to the magnitude of
the current:

If we use the effective values of the sinusoidal voltage and current,
Eq. 10.27 becomes
(10.28)
Equations 10.27 and 10.28 are important relationships in power calcula-
tions because they show that if the phasor current and voltage are known at
a pair of terminals, the complex power associated with that pair of terminals
is either one half the product of the voltage and the conjugate of the cur-
rent, or the product of the rms phasor voltage and the conjugate of the rms
phasor current.We can show this for the rms phasor voltage and current in
Fig. 10.11 as follows:

Note that 
follows from Euler’s identity and the trigonomet-
ric identities

The same derivation technique could be applied to Eq. 10.27 to yield
(10.30)
Both Eqs. 10.29 and 10.30 are based on the passive sign convention. If the
current reference is in the direction of the voltage rise across the termi-
nals, we insert a minus sign on the right-hand side of each equation.
To illustrate the use of Eq. 10.30 in a power calculation, let’s use the
same circuit that we used in Example 10.1. Expressed in terms of the pha-

Once we calculate the complex power, we can read off both the real and
reactive powers, because 
Thus
The interpretations of the algebraic signs on P and Q are identical to those
given in the solution of Example 10.1.
Alternate Forms for Complex Power
Equations 10.29 and 10.30 have several useful variations. Here, we use the
rms value form of the equations, because rms values are the most common
type of representation for voltages and currents in power computations.
The first variation of Eq. 10.29 is to replace the voltage with the prod-
uct of the current times the impedance. In other words, we can always rep-
resent the circuit inside the box of Fig. 10.11 by an equivalent impedance,
as shown in Fig. 10.12.Then,
(10.31)
Substituting Eq. 10.31 into Eq. 10.29 yields
(10.32)
from which
(10.33)
(10.34)
In Eq. 10.34, X is the reactance of either the equivalent inductance or
equivalent capacitance of the circuit. Recall from our earlier discussion of
reactance that it is positive for inductive circuits and negative for capaci-
tive circuits.
A second useful variation of Eq. 10.29 comes from replacing the cur-
rent with the voltage divided by the impedance:

Calculating Average and Reactive Power
In the circuit shown in Fig. 10.13, a load having an
impedance of 
is fed from a voltage
source through a line having an impedance of
The effective, or rms, value of the source
voltage is 250 V.
a) Calculate the load current 
and voltage 
b) Calculate the average and reactive power deliv-
ered to the load.
c) Calculate the average and reactive power deliv-
ered to the line.
d) Calculate the average and reactive power sup-
plied by the source.
Solution
a) The line and load impedances are in series across
the voltage source, so the load current equals the
voltage divided by the total impedance, or
Because the voltage is given in terms of its
rms value, the current also is rms. The load volt-
age is the product of the load current and load
impedance:
b) The average and reactive power delivered to the
load can be computed using Eq. 10.29.Therefore
 = 975 + j650 VA.
 S = VLIL* = (234 - j13)(4 + j3)
 = 234.36  l -3.18° V (rms).
 VL = (39 + j26)IL = 234 - j13
IL =

40 + j30 = 4 - j3 = 5  l -36.87° A (rms).

Thus the load is absorbing an average power of
975 W and a reactive power of 650 VAR.
Figure 10.13  The circuit for Example 10.5.
c) The average and reactive power delivered to the
line are most easily calculated from Eqs. 10.33
and 10.34 because the line current is known.Thus
Note that the reactive power associated with the
line is positive because the line reactance is
inductive.
d) One way to calculate the average and reactive
power delivered by the source is to add the com-
plex power delivered to the line to that delivered
to the load, or
The complex power at the source can also be cal-
culated from Eq. 10.29:
Ss = -250IL*.
 = 1000 + j  750 VA.
 S = 25 + j100 + 975 + j650

The minus sign is inserted in Eq. 10.29 whenever
the current reference is in the direction of a volt-
age rise.Thus
Ss = -250(4 + j3) = -(1000 + j  750) VA.
The minus sign implies that both average power
and magnetizing reactive power are being deliv-
ered by the source. Note that this result agrees
with the previous calculation of S, as it must,
because the source must furnish all the average
and reactive power absorbed by the line and load.
Example 10.6
Calculating Power in Parallel Loads
The two loads in the circuit shown in Fig. 10.14 can
be described as follows: Load 1 absorbs an average
power of 8 kW at a leading power factor of 0.8.
Load 2 absorbs 20 kVA at a lagging power factor 
of 0.6.

a) Determine the power factor of the two loads in
parallel.
b) Determine the apparent power required to supply
the loads, the magnitude of the current,
, and the
average power loss in the transmission line.
c) Given that the frequency of the source is 60 Hz,
compute the value of the capacitor that would
correct the power factor to 1 if placed in parallel
with the two loads. Recompute the values in (b)
for the load with the corrected power factor.

a) All voltage and current phasors in this problem
are assumed to represent effective values. Note
from the circuit diagram in Fig. 10.14 that

Sinusoidal Steady-State Power Calculations
The average power lost in the line results from
the current flowing through the line resistance:
Note that the power supplied totals 
even though the loads require a
total of only 20,000 W.
c) As we can see from the power triangle in
Fig. 10.15(c), we can correct the power factor to 1
if we place a capacitor in parallel with the existing
loads such that the capacitor supplies 10 kVAR
of magnetizing reactive power. The value of the
capacitor is calculated as follows. First, find the
capacitive reactance from Eq. 10.37:
Recall that the reactive impedance of a capacitor
is 
and 
if
the source frequency is 60 Hz.Thus,
The addition of the capacitor as the third load is
represented in geometric form as the sum of the
two power triangles shown in Fig. 10.16. When

apparent power once the power factor has been

10.6 Maximum Power Transfer
Recall from Chapter 4 that certain systems—for example, those that trans-
mit information via electric signals—depend on being able to transfer a
maximum amount of power from the source to the load.We now reexam-
ine maximum power transfer in the context of a sinusoidal steady-state
network, beginning with Fig. 10.18. We must determine the load imped-
ance 
that results in the delivery of maximum average power to termi-
nals a and b.Any linear network may be viewed from the terminals of the
load in terms of a Thévenin equivalent circuit. Thus the task reduces to
finding the value of 
that results in maximum average power delivered
to 
in the circuit shown in Fig. 10.19.
For maximum average power transfer,
must equal the conjugate of
the Thévenin impedance; that is,

Figure 10.19  The circuit shown in Fig. 10.18, with

We derive Eq. 10.38 by a straightforward application of elementary calcu-
lus.We begin by expressing 
and 
in rectangular form:
(10.39)
(10.40)
In both Eqs. 10.39 and 10.40, the reactance term carries its own algebraic
sign—positive for inductance and negative for capacitance. Because we
are making an average-power calculation, we assume that the amplitude
of the Thévenin voltage is expressed in terms of its rms value.We also use
the Thévenin voltage as the reference phasor. Then, from Fig. 10.19, the
rms value of the load current I is
(10.41)
The average power delivered to the load is
(10.42)
Substituting Eq. 10.41 into Eq. 10.42 yields
(10.43)
When working with Eq. 10.43, always remember that 
and 
are fixed quantities, whereas 
and 
are independent variables.
Therefore, to maximize P, we must find the values of 
and 
where
and 
are both zero. From Eq. 10.43,

Sinusoidal Steady-State Power Calculations
The Maximum Average Power Absorbed
The maximum average power that can be delivered to 
when it is set
equal to the conjugate of 
is calculated directly from the circuit in
Fig. 10.19. When 
the rms load current is 
and the max-
imum average power delivered to the load is
(10.48)
If the Thévenin voltage is expressed in terms of its maximum amplitude
rather than its rms amplitude, Eq. 10.48 becomes
(10.49)
Maximum Power Transfer When Z is Restricted
Maximum average power can be delivered to 
only if 
can be set
equal to the conjugate of 
There are situations in which this is not pos-
sible. First,
and 
may be restricted to a limited range of values. In
this situation, the optimum condition for 
and 
is to adjust 
as
near to 
as possible and then adjust 
as close to
as possible (see Example 10.9).
A second type of restriction occurs when the magnitude of 
can be
varied but its phase angle cannot. Under this restriction, the greatest
amount of power is transferred to the load when the magnitude of 
is
set equal to the magnitude of 
that is, when
(10.50)
The proof of Eq. 10.50 is left to you as Problem 10.45.
For purely resistive networks, maximum power transfer occurs when
the load resistance equals the Thévenin resistance. Note that we first
derived this result in the introduction to maximum power transfer in
Chapter 4.
Examples 10.8–10.11 illustrate the problem of obtaining maximum
power transfer in the situations just discussed.

Practical Perspective
Vampire Power
Vampire power, or standby power, may cost you more than you think. The average household
has about 40 electrical products that draw power, even when turned off. Approximately 5%
of typical residential power consumption can be attributed to standby power. Table 10.3 
provides the power consumption of several different devices. Notice that when a device is
considered to be off, it is often still consuming power.
Consider a typical mobile phone charger. According to the values given in Table 10.3,
when the charger is detached from the phone it consumes only a fraction of the power that
is used when the charger is attached to the phone and the phone is charging. Suppose you
charge your phone for three hours each day, but leave the charger plugged into the wall 
outlet 24 hours a day. Recall that the electric company bills you based on the number of
kilowatt-hours (kWh) you use in a given month. A device that uses 1000 W of power

continuously over one hour has consumed 1 kWh. Let’s calculate the number of kilowatt-hours used by
the phone charger in one month.
Now do the calculation again, this time assuming that you unplug the charger when it is not being used
to charge the phone.
Keeping the charger plugged in when you are not using it causes the charger to consume more than 5 times
the power needed to charge your phone every day. You can therefore minimize the cost of vampire power by
unplugging electrical devices if they are not being used.
How can the phone charger consume power when not plugged into the phone? The electronic circuitry
in your phone uses 5 V(dc) sources to supply power. The phone charger must transform the 120 V(rms) 
signal supplied by the wall outlet into a signal that can be used to charge the phone. Phone chargers can
use linear transformers, together with other circuitry, to output a voltage suited to the phone.
Consider the circuit in Fig. 10.28. The linear transformer is part of the circuitry used to reduce the
voltage supplied by the source to a level suited to the phone. The additional components needed to com-
plete this task are not shown in the circuit. When the phone is unplugged from the circuit in Fig. 10.28,
but the circuit is still connected to the 120 V(rms) source, there is still a path for the current, as shown
in Fig. 10.29. The current is
The real power, delivered by the voltage source and supplied to the resistors, is
This is the vampire power being consumed by the phone charger even when it is not connected to the phone.

Sinusoidal Steady-State Power Calculations
Summary
•
Instantaneous power is the product of the instanta-
neous terminal voltage and current, or 
The
positive sign is used when the reference direction for
the current is from the positive to the negative refer-
ence polarity of the voltage. The frequency of the
instantaneous power is twice the frequency of the volt-
age (or current). (See page 360.)
•
Average power is the average value of the instanta-
neous power over one period. It is the power converted
from electric to nonelectric form and vice versa. This
conversion is the reason that average power is also
referred to as real power. Average power, with the pas-
sive sign convention, is expressed as
(See page 362.)
•
Reactive power is the electric power exchanged
between the magnetic field of an inductor and the
source that drives it or between the electric field of a
capacitor and the source that drives it. Reactive
power is never converted to nonelectric power.
Reactive power, with the passive sign convention, is
expressed as
Both average power and reactive power can be
expressed in terms of either peak (
) or effective
(
) current and voltage. Effective values are
widely used in both household and industrial applica-
tions. Effective value and rms value are interchangeable
terms for the same value. (See page 362.)

•
The power factor is the cosine of the phase angle
between the voltage and the current:
The terms lagging and leading added to the description
of the power factor indicate whether the current is lag-
ging or leading the voltage and thus whether the load is
inductive or capacitive. (See page 363.)
•
The reactive factor is the sine of the phase angle
between the voltage and the current:
(See page 363.)
•
Complex power is the complex sum of the real and reac-
tive powers, or
(See page 368.)
•
Apparent power is the magnitude of the complex power:
(See page 368.)
•
The watt is used as the unit for both instantaneous and
real power. The var (volt amp reactive, or VAR) is used
as the unit for reactive power. The volt-amp (VA) is
used as the unit for complex and apparent power. (See
page 368.)
•
Maximum power transfer occurs in circuits operating in
the sinusoidal steady state when the load impedance is
the conjugate of the Thévenin impedance as viewed from
the terminals of the load impedance. (See page 376.)

CHAPTER
Generating, transmitting, distributing, and using large blocks
of electric power is accomplished with three-phase circuits. The
comprehensive analysis of such systems is a field of study in its
own right; we cannot hope to cover it in a single chapter.
Fortunately, an understanding of only the steady-state sinusoidal
behavior of balanced three-phase circuits is sufficient for engi-
neers who do not specialize in power systems.We define what we
mean by a balanced circuit later in the discussion. The same cir-
cuit analysis techniques discussed in earlier chapters can be
applied to either unbalanced or balanced three-phase circuits.
Here we use these familiar techniques to develop several short-
cuts to the analysis of balanced three-phase circuits.
For economic reasons, three-phase systems are usually
designed to operate in the balanced state. Thus, in this introduc-
tory treatment, we can justify considering only balanced circuits.
The analysis of unbalanced three-phase circuits, which you will
encounter if you study electric power in later courses, relies heav-
ily on an understanding of balanced circuits.
The basic structure of a three-phase system consists of volt-
age sources connected to loads by means of transformers and
transmission lines. To analyze such a circuit, we can reduce it to a
voltage source connected to a load via a line.The omission of the
transformer simplifies the discussion without jeopardizing a basic
understanding of the calculations involved. Figure 11.1 on
page 398 shows a basic circuit. A defining characteristic of a bal-
anced three-phase circuit is that it contains a set of balanced
three-phase voltages at its source. We begin by considering these
voltages, and then we move to the voltage and current relation-
ships for the Y-Y and Y-
circuits. After considering voltage and
current in such circuits, we conclude with sections on power and
power measurement.

In this chapter we introduce circuits that are designed to
handle large blocks of electric power. These are the circuits
that are used to transport electric power from the generating
plants to both industrial and residential customers. We intro-
duced the typical residential customer circuit as used in the
United States as the design perspective in Chapter 9. Now we
introduce the type of circuit used to deliver electric power to
an entire residential subdivision.
One of the constraints imposed on the design and oper-
ation of an electric utility is the requirement that the utility
maintain the rms voltage level at the customer’s premises.
Whether lightly loaded, as at 3:00 am, or heavily loaded, as
at midafternoon on a hot, humid day, the utility is obligated
to supply the same rms voltage. Recall from Chapter 10 that
a capacitor can be thought of as a source of magnetizing
vars. Therefore, one technique for maintaining voltage levels
on a utility system is to place capacitors at strategic loca-
tions in the distribution network. The idea behind this tech-
nique is to use the capacitors to supply magnetizing vars
close to the loads requiring them, as opposed to sending
them over the lines from the generator. We shall illustrate
this concept after we have introduced the analysis of bal-
anced three-phase circuits.

Balanced Three-Phase Circuits
11.1 Balanced Three-Phase Voltages
A set of balanced three-phase voltages consists of three sinusoidal volt-
ages that have identical amplitudes and frequencies but are out of phase
with each other by exactly 
Standard practice is to refer to the three
phases as a, b, and c, and to use the a-phase as the reference phase. The
three voltages are referred to as the a-phase voltage, the b-phase voltage,
and the c-phase voltage.
Only two possible phase relationships can exist between the a-phase
voltage and the b- and c-phase voltages. One possibility is for the b-phase
voltage to lag the a-phase voltage by 
in which case the c-phase volt-
age must lead the a-phase voltage by 
This phase relationship is
known as the abc (or positive) phase sequence. The only other possibility
is for the b-phase voltage to lead the a-phase voltage by 
in which
case the c-phase voltage must lag the a-phase voltage by 
This phase
relationship is known as the acb (or negative) phase sequence. In phasor
notation, the two possible sets of balanced phase voltages are
(11.1)
and
(11.2)
Equations 11.1 are for the abc, or positive, sequence. Equations 11.2
are for the acb, or negative, sequence. Figure 11.2 shows the phasor dia-
grams of the voltage sets in Eqs. 11.1 and 11.2. The phase sequence is
the clockwise order of the subscripts around the diagram from 
The
fact that a three-phase circuit can have one of two phase sequences
must be taken into account whenever two such circuits operate in par-
allel. The circuits can operate in parallel only if they have the same
phase sequence.
Another important characteristic of a set of balanced three-phase
voltages is that the sum of the voltages is zero. Thus, from either Eqs. 11.1
or Eqs. 11.2,
(11.3)
Because the sum of the phasor voltages is zero, the sum of the instanta-
neous voltages also is zero; that is,
(11.4)
Now that we know the nature of a balanced set of three-phase volt-
ages, we can state the first of the analytical shortcuts alluded to in the
introduction to this chapter: If we know the phase sequence and

one voltage in the set, we know the entire set. Thus for a balanced three-
phase system, we can focus on determining the voltage (or current) in one
phase, because once we know one phase quantity, we know the others.
NOTE: Assess your understanding of three-phase voltages by trying
Chapter Problems 11.1 and 11.2.
11.2 Three-Phase Voltage Sources
A three-phase voltage source is a generator with three separate wind-
ings distributed around the periphery of the stator. Each winding com-
prises one phase of the generator. The rotor of the generator is an
electromagnet driven at synchronous speed by a prime mover, such as a
steam or gas turbine. Rotation of the electromagnet induces a sinusoidal
voltage in each winding. The phase windings are designed so that the
sinusoidal voltages induced in them are equal in amplitude and out of
phase with each other by 
The phase windings are stationary with
respect to the rotating electromagnet, so the frequency of the voltage
induced in each winding is the same. Figure 11.3 shows a sketch of a two-
pole three-phase source.
There are two ways of interconnecting the separate phase windings to
form a three-phase source: in either a wye (Y) or a delta ( ) configura-
tion. Figure 11.4 shows both, with ideal voltage sources used to model the
phase windings of the three-phase generator.The common terminal in the
Y-connected source, labeled n in Fig. 11.4(a), is called the neutral terminal
of the source.The neutral terminal may or may not be available for exter-
nal connections.
Sometimes, the impedance of each phase winding is so small (com-
pared with other impedances in the circuit) that we need not account for it
in modeling the generator; the model consists solely of ideal voltage
sources, as in Fig. 11.4. However, if the impedance of each phase winding is
not negligible, we place the winding impedance in series with an ideal
sinusoidal voltage source. All windings on the machine are of the same
construction, so we assume the winding impedances to be identical. The
winding impedance of a three-phase generator is inductive. Figure 11.5
shows a model of such a machine, in which is the winding resistance, and
is the inductive reactance of the winding.
Because three-phase sources and loads can be either Y-connected
or 
-connected, the basic circuit in Fig. 11.1 represents four different
configurations:

Figure 11.6 illustrates a general Y-Y circuit, in which we included a fourth
conductor that connects the source neutral to the load neutral. A fourth
conductor is possible only in the Y-Y arrangement. (More about this
later.) For convenience, we transformed the Y connections into “tipped-
over tees.” In Fig. 11.6,

necting the source neutral to the load neutral; and 
and

sent the impedance of each phase of the load.
We can describe this circuit with a single node-voltage equation.
Using the source neutral as the reference node and letting 
denote the
node voltage between the nodes N and n, we find that the node-voltage
equation is

11.3
Analysis of the Wye-Wye Circuit
401
This is the general equation for any circuit of the Y-Y configuration
depicted in Fig. 11.6. But we can simplify Eq. 11.5 significantly if we now
consider the formal definition of a balanced three-phase circuit. Such a
circuit satisfies the following criteria:
1. The voltage sources form a set of balanced three-phase voltages.
In Fig. 11.6, this means that 
and 
are a set of bal-
anced three-phase voltages.
2. The impedance of each phase of the voltage source is the same. In
Fig. 11.6, this means that 
3. The impedance of each line (or phase) conductor is the same. In
Fig. 11.6, this means that 
4. The impedance of each phase of the load is the same. In Fig. 11.6,
this means that 
There is no restriction on the impedance of a neutral conductor; its
value has no effect on whether the system is balanced.
If the circuit in Fig. 11.6 is balanced, we may rewrite Eq. 11.5 as
(11.6)
where
The right-hand side of Eq. 11.6 is zero, because by hypothesis the numera-
tor is a set of balanced three-phase voltages and 
is not zero. The only
value of 
that satisfies Eq. 11.6 is zero. Therefore, for a balanced three-
phase circuit,
(11.7)
Equation 11.7 is extremely important. If 
is zero, there is no differ-
ence in potential between the source neutral, n, and the load neutral, N;
consequently, the current in the neutral conductor is zero. Hence we may
either remove the neutral conductor from a balanced Y-Y configuration
(
) or replace it with a perfect short circuit between the nodes n and
N (
). Both equivalents are convenient to use when modeling bal-
anced three-phase circuits.
We now turn to the effect that balanced conditions have on the three
line currents. With reference to Fig. 11.6, when the system is balanced, the
three line currents are
(11.8)
(11.9)
(11.10)
We see that the three line currents form a balanced set of three-phase cur-
rents; that is, the current in each line is equal in amplitude and frequency
and is 
out of phase with the other two line currents.Thus, if we calcu-
late the current 
and we know the phase sequence, we have a shortcut

Balanced Three-Phase Circuits
for finding 
and 
This procedure parallels the shortcut used to find
the b- and c-phase source voltages from the a-phase source voltage.
We can use Eq. 11.8 to construct an equivalent circuit for the a-phase
of the balanced Y-Y circuit. From this equation, the current in the a-phase
conductor line is simply the voltage generated in the a-phase winding of
the generator divided by the total impedance in the a-phase of the circuit.
Thus Eq. 11.8 describes the simple circuit shown in Fig. 11.7, in which the
neutral conductor has been replaced by a perfect short circuit. The circuit
in Fig. 11.7 is referred to as the single-phase equivalent circuit of a bal-
anced three-phase circuit. Because of the established relationships
between phases, once we solve this circuit, we can easily write down the
voltages and currents in the other two phases. Thus, drawing a single-
phase equivalent circuit is an important first step in analyzing a three-
phase circuit.
A word of caution here. The current in the neutral conductor in
Fig. 11.7 is 
which is not the same as the current in the neutral conduc-
tor of the balanced three-phase circuit, which is
(11.11)
Thus the circuit shown in Fig. 11.7 gives the correct value of the line cur-
rent but only the a-phase component of the neutral current. Whenever
this single-phase equivalent circuit is applicable, the line currents form
a balanced three-phase set, and the right-hand side of Eq. 11.11 sums 
to zero.
Once we know the line current in Fig. 11.7, calculating any voltages of
interest is relatively simple. Of particular interest is the relationship
between the line-to-line voltages and the line-to-neutral voltages. We
establish this relationship at the load terminals, but our observations also
apply at the source terminals. The line-to-line voltages at the load termi-
nals can be seen in Fig. 11.8.They are 
and 
where the dou-
ble subscript notation indicates a voltage drop from the first-named node
to the second. (Because we are interested in the balanced state, we have
omitted the neutral conductor from Fig. 11.8.)
The line-to-neutral voltages are 
and 
We can now
describe the line-to-line voltages in terms of the line-to-neutral voltages,
using Kirchhoff’s voltage law:
(11.12)
(11.13)
(11.14)
To show the relationship between the line-to-line voltages and the
line-to-neutral voltages, we assume a positive, or abc, sequence. Using the
line-to-neutral voltage of the a-phase as the reference,

represents the magnitude of the line-to-neutral voltage.
Substituting Eqs. 11.15–11.17 into Eqs. 11.12–11.14, respectively, yields
(11.18)
(11.19)
(11.20)
Equations 11.18–11.20 reveal that
1. The magnitude of the line-to-line voltage is 
times the magni-
tude of the line-to-neutral voltage.
2. The line-to-line voltages form a balanced three-phase set of voltages.
3. The set of line-to-line voltages leads the set of line-to-neutral volt-
ages by 
We leave to you the demonstration that for a negative sequence, the only
change is that the set of line-to-line voltages lags the set of line-to-neutral
voltages by 
The phasor diagrams shown in Fig. 11.9 summarize these
observations. Here, again, is a shortcut in the analysis of a balanced sys-
tem: If you know the line-to-neutral voltage at some point in the circuit,
you can easily determine the line-to-line voltage at the same point and
vice versa.
We now pause to elaborate on terminology. Line voltage refers to the
voltage across any pair of lines; phase voltage refers to the voltage across
a single phase. Line current refers to the current in a single line; phase
current refers to current in a single phase. Observe that in a 
connec-
tion, line voltage and phase voltage are identical, and in a Y connection,
line current and phase current are identical.
Because three-phase systems are designed to handle large blocks of
electric power, all voltage and current specifications are given as rms val-
ues. When voltage ratings are given, they refer specifically to the rating of
the line voltage. Thus when a three-phase transmission line is rated at
345 kV, the nominal value of the rms line-to-line voltage is 345,000 V. In
this chapter we express all voltages and currents as rms values.
Finally, the Greek letter phi ( ) is widely used in the literature to
denote a per-phase quantity. Thus 
and 
are interpreted
as voltage/phase, current/phase, impedance/phase, power/phase, and
reactive power/phase, respectively.
Example 11.1 shows how to use the observations made so far to solve
a balanced three-phase Y-Y circuit.

11.4 Analysis of the Wye-Delta Circuit
If the load in a three-phase circuit is connected in a delta, it can be trans-
formed into a wye by using the delta-to-wye transformation discussed in
Section 9.6. When the load is balanced, the impedance of each leg of the
wye is one third the impedance of each leg of the delta, or
(11.21)
which follows directly from Eqs. 9.51–9.53. After the 
load has been
replaced by its Y equivalent, the a-phase can be modeled by the single-
phase equivalent circuit shown in Fig. 11.11.
We use this circuit to calculate the line currents, and we then use the
line currents to find the currents in each leg of the original 
load. The
relationship between the line currents and the currents in each leg of the
delta can be derived using the circuit shown in Fig. 11.12.
When a load (or source) is connected in a delta, the current in each leg
of the delta is the phase current, and the voltage across each leg is the
phase voltage. Figure 11.12 shows that, in the 
configuration, the phase
voltage is identical to the line voltage.
To demonstrate the relationship between the phase currents and line
currents, we assume a positive phase sequence and let 
represent the
magnitude of the phase current.Then

In writing these equations, we arbitrarily selected 
as the reference
phasor.
We can write the line currents in terms of the phase currents by direct
application of Kirchhoff’s current law:
(11.25)
(11.26)
(11.27)
Comparing Eqs. 11.25–11.27 with Eqs. 11.22–11.24 reveals that the magni-
tude of the line currents is 
times the magnitude of the phase currents
and that the set of line currents lags the set of phase currents by 
We leave to you to verify that, for a negative phase sequence, the line
currents are 
times larger than the phase currents and lead the phase
currents by 
Thus, we have a shortcut for calculating line currents from
phase currents (or vice versa) for a balanced three-phase 
-connected
load. Figure 11.13 summarizes this shortcut graphically. Example 11.2

Balanced Three-Phase Circuits
11.5 Power Calculations in Balanced
Three-Phase Circuits
So far, we have limited our analysis of balanced three-phase circuits to
determining currents and voltages. We now discuss three-phase power
calculations. We begin by considering the average power delivered to a
balanced Y-connected load.
Average Power in a Balanced Wye Load
Figure 11.15 shows a Y-connected load,along with its pertinent currents and
voltages.We calculate the average power associated with any one phase by
using the techniques introduced in Chapter 10. With Eq. 10.21 as a starting
point, we express the average power associated with the a-phase as
(11.28)
where 
and 
denote the phase angles of 
and 
respectively.
Using the notation introduced in Eq. 11.28, we can find the power associ-
ated with the b- and c-phases:
(11.29)
(11.30)
In Eqs. 11.28–11.30, all phasor currents and voltages are written in terms
of the rms value of the sinusoidal function they represent.
In a balanced three-phase system,the magnitude of each line-to-neutral
voltage is the same, as is the magnitude of each phase current. The argu-
ment of the cosine functions is also the same for all three phases. We
emphasize these observations by introducing the following notation:
(11.31)
(11.32)
and
(11.33)
Moreover, for a balanced system, the power delivered to each phase of the
load is the same, so
(11.34)
where 
represents the average power per phase.
The total average power delivered to the balanced Y-connected load
is simply three times the power per phase, or
(11.35)
Expressing the total power in terms of the rms magnitudes of the line volt-
age and current is also desirable. If we let 
and 
represent the rms
magnitudes of the line voltage and current, respectively, we can modify
Eq. 11.35 as follows:

Power Calculations in Balanced Three-Phase Circuits

In deriving Eq. 11.36, we recognized that, for a balanced Y-connected
load, the magnitude of the phase voltage is the magnitude of the line volt-
age divided by 
and that the magnitude of the line current is equal to
the magnitude of the phase current.When using Eq. 11.36 to calculate the
total power delivered to the load, remember that 
is the phase angle
between the phase voltage and current.
Complex Power in a Balanced Wye Load
We can also calculate the reactive power and complex power associated
with any one phase of a Y-connected load by using the techniques intro-
duced in Chapter 10. For a balanced load, the expressions for the reactive
power are
(11.37)
(11.38)
Equation 10.29 is the basis for expressing the complex power associated
with any phase. For a balanced load,

and 
represent a phase voltage and current taken from the
same phase.Thus, in general,

(11.41)
Power Calculations in a Balanced Delta Load
If the load is -connected, the calculation of power—reactive or complex—
is basically the same as that for a Y-connected load. Figure 11.16 shows a 
-connected load, along with its pertinent currents and voltages. The
power associated with each phase is

For a balanced load,
(11.45)
(11.46)
(11.47)
and
(11.48)
Note that Eq. 11.48 is the same as Eq. 11.34. Thus, in a balanced load,
regardless of whether it is Y- or -connected, the average power per phase
is equal to the product of the rms magnitude of the phase voltage, the rms
magnitude of the phase current, and the cosine of the angle between the
phase voltage and current.

The total power delivered to a balanced -connected load is
(11.49)
Note that Eq. 11.49 is the same as Eq. 11.36. The expressions for reactive
power and complex power also have the same form as those developed for
the Y load:

(11.52)
(11.53)
Instantaneous Power in Three-Phase Circuits
Although we are primarily interested in average, reactive, and complex
power calculations, the computation of the total instantaneous power is
also important. In a balanced three-phase circuit, this power has an inter-
esting property: It is invariant with time! Thus the torque developed at the
shaft of a three-phase motor is constant, which in turn means less vibra-
tion in machinery powered by three-phase motors.
Let the instantaneous line-to-neutral voltage 
be the reference,
and, as before,
is the phase angle 
Then, for a positive phase
sequence, the instantaneous power in each phase is
where 
and 
represent the maximum amplitude of the phase voltage
and line current, respectively. The total instantaneous power is the sum of
the instantaneous phase powers, which reduces to 
that is,
Note this result is consistent with Eq. 11.35 since

11.6 Measuring Average Power 
in Three-Phase Circuits
The basic instrument used to measure power in three-phase circuits is the
electrodynamometer wattmeter. It contains two coils. One coil, called the
current coil, is stationary and is designed to carry a current proportional to
the load current. The second coil, called the potential coil, is movable and
carries a current proportional to the load voltage. The important features
of the wattmeter are shown in Fig. 11.18.
The average deflection of the pointer attached to the movable coil is
proportional to the product of the effective value of the current in the cur-
rent coil, the effective value of the voltage impressed on the potential coil,
and the cosine of the phase angle between the voltage and current. The
direction in which the pointer deflects depends on the instantaneous polar-
ity of the current-coil current and the potential-coil voltage.Therefore each
coil has one terminal with a polarity mark—usually a plus sign—but some-
times the double polarity mark 
is used. The wattmeter deflects upscale
when (1) the polarity-marked terminal of the current coil is toward the
source, and (2) the polarity-marked terminal of the potential coil is con-
nected to the same line in which the current coil has been inserted.
The Two-Wattmeter Method
Consider a general network inside a box to which power is supplied by 
n conducting lines. Such a system is shown in Fig. 11.19.
If we wish to measure the total power at the terminals of the box, we
need to know 
currents and voltages. This follows because if we
choose one terminal as a reference, there are only 
independent
voltages. Likewise, only 
independent currents can exist in the n con-
ductors entering the box.Thus the total power is the sum of 
product
terms; that is, p = v1i1 + v2i2 + Á + vn-1in-1.

Balanced Three-Phase Circuits
Applying this general observation, we can see that for a three-
conductor circuit, whether balanced or not, we need only two wattmeters
to measure the total power. For a four-conductor circuit, we need three
wattmeters if the three-phase circuit is unbalanced, but only two
wattmeters if it is balanced, because in the latter case there is no current in
the neutral line. Thus, only two wattmeters are needed to measure the
total average power in any balanced three-phase system.
The two-wattmeter method reduces to determining the magnitude
and algebraic sign of the average power indicated by each wattmeter. We
can describe the basic problem in terms of the circuit shown in Fig. 11.20,
where the two wattmeters are indicated by the shaded boxes and labeled
and 
The coil notations cc and pc stand for current coil and poten-
tial coil, respectively. We have elected to insert the current coils of the
wattmeters in lines aA and cC. Thus, line bB is the reference line for the
two potential coils.The load is connected as a wye, and the per-phase load
impedance is designated as 
This is a general representation,
as any 
-connected load can be represented by its Y equivalent; further-
more, for the balanced case, the impedance angle 
is unaffected by the 
-to-Y transformation.
We now develop general equations for the readings of the two
wattmeters. We assume that the current drawn by the potential coil of the
wattmeter is negligible compared with the line current measured by the cur-
rent coil.We further assume that the loads can be modeled by passive circuit
elements so that the phase angle of the load impedance ( in Fig. 11.20) lies
between 
(pure capacitance) and 
(pure inductance). Finally, we
assume a positive phase sequence.
From our introductory discussion of the average deflection of the
wattmeter, we can see that wattmeter 1 will respond to the product of
and the cosine of the angle between 
and 
If we denote
this wattmeter reading as 
we can write
(11.54)
It follows that
(11.55)
In Eq. 11.54,

and 
and in Eq. 11.55,
is the phase angle between 
and 
To calculate

we express 
and 
in terms of the imped-
ance angle 
which is also the same as the phase angle between the phase
voltage and current. For a positive phase sequence,
(11.56)
(11.57)
The derivation of Eqs. 11.56 and 11.57 is left as an exercise (see
Problem 11.35). When we substitute Eqs. 11.56 and 11.57 into Eqs. 11.54

Measuring Average Power in Three-Phase Circuits

To find the total power, we add 
and 
thus
(11.60)
which is the expression for the total power in a three-phase circuit.
Therefore we have confirmed that the sum of the two wattmeter readings
yields the total average power.
A closer look at Eqs. 11.58 and 11.59 reveals the following about the
readings of the two wattmeters:
1. If the power factor is greater than 0.5, both wattmeters read positive.
2. If the power factor equals 0.5, one wattmeter reads zero.
3. If the power factor is less than 0.5, one wattmeter reads negative.
4. Reversing the phase sequence will interchange the readings on the
two wattmeters.

Balanced Three-Phase Circuits
Practical Perspective
Transmission and Distribution of Electric Power
At the start of this chapter we pointed out the obligation utilities have to
maintain the rms voltage level at their customer’s premises. Although the
acceptable deviation from a nominal level may vary among different utilities
we will assume for purposes of discussion that an allowable tolerance is
Thus a nominal rms voltage of 
could range from 
to
. We also pointed out that capacitors strategically located on the sys-
tem could be used to support voltage levels.
The circuit shown in Fig. 11.21 represents a substation on a Midwestern
municipal system. We will assume the system is balanced, the line-to-line
voltage at the substation is 
, the phase impedance of the distribu-
tion line is 
and the load at the substation at 3 PM on a hot,
humid day in July is 
and 
magnetizing 
.
Using the line-to-neutral voltage at the substation as a reference, the
single-phase equivalent circuit for the system in Fig. 11.21 is shown in
Fig. 11.22. The line current can be calculated from the expression for the
complex power at the substation. Thus,
It follows that
or
The line-to-neutral voltage at the generating plant is
Therefore the magnitude of the line voltage at the generating plant is
We are assuming the utility is required to keep the voltage level within
of the nominal value. This means the magnitude of the line-to-line
voltage at the power plant should not exceed 
nor be less than
. Therefore, the magnitude of the line voltage at the generating plant
could cause problems for customers.
When the magnetizing vars are supplied by a capacitor bank connected
to the substation bus, the line current

Summary
•
When analyzing balanced three-phase circuits, the first
step is to transform any 
connections into Y connections,
so that the overall circuit is of the Y-Y configuration. (See
page 400.)
•
A single-phase equivalent circuit is used to calculate the
line current and the phase voltage in one phase of the 
Y-Y structure. The a-phase is normally chosen for this
purpose. (See page 402.)
•
Once we know the line current and phase voltage in the
a-phase equivalent circuit, we can take analytical short-
cuts to find any current or voltage in a balanced three-
phase circuit, based on the following facts:
•
The b- and c-phase currents and voltages are identi-
cal to the a-phase current and voltage except for a
shift in phase. In a positive-sequence circuit, the
b-phase quantity lags the a-phase quantity by 
and the c-phase quantity leads the a-phase quantity
by 
For a negative sequence circuit, phases 
b and c are interchanged with respect to phase a.
•
The set of line voltages is out of phase with the set of
phase voltages by 
The plus or minus sign corre-
sponds to positive and negative sequence,respectively.
•
In a Y-Y circuit the magnitude of a line voltage is 
times the magnitude of a phase voltage.

¢
•
The set of line currents is out of phase with the set of
phase currents in 
-connected sources and loads by
The minus or plus sign corresponds to positive
and negative sequence, respectively.
•
The magnitude of a line current is 
times the mag-
nitude of a phase current in a 
-connected source 
or load.
(See pages 402–403 and 405–406.)
•
The techniques for calculating per-phase average
power, reactive power, and complex power are identical
to those introduced in Chapter 10. (See page 408.)
•
The total real, reactive, and complex power can be deter-
mined either by multiplying the corresponding per phase
quantity by 3 or by using the expressions based on line
current and line voltage, as given by Eqs. 11.36, 11.38, and
11.41. (See pages 408 and 409.)
•
The total instantaneous power in a balanced three-phase
circuit is constant and equals 1.5 times the average
power per phase. (See page 410.)
•
A wattmeter measures the average power delivered to a
load by using a current coil connected in series with 
the load and a potential coil connected in parallel 
with the load. (See page 413.)
•
The total average power in a balanced three-phase cir-
cuit can be measured by summing the readings of two
wattmeters connected in two different phases of the
circuit. (See page 413.)

We now introduce a powerful analytical technique that is
widely used to study the behavior of linear, lumped-parameter
circuits.The method is based on the Laplace transform, which we
define mathematically in Section 12.1. Before doing so, we need
to explain why another analytical technique is needed. First, we
wish to consider the transient behavior of circuits whose describ-
ing equations consist of more than a single node-voltage or mesh-
current differential equation. In other words, we want to consider
multiple-node and multiple-mesh circuits that are described by
sets of linear differential equations.
Second, we wish to determine the transient response of cir-
cuits whose signal sources vary in ways more complicated than
the simple dc level jumps considered in Chapters 7 and 8. Third,
we can use the Laplace transform to introduce the concept of the
transfer function as a tool for analyzing the steady-state sinu-
soidal response of a circuit when the frequency of the sinusoidal
source is varied. We discuss the transfer function in Chapter 13.
Finally, we wish to relate, in a systematic fashion, the time-
domain behavior of a circuit to its frequency-domain behavior.
Using the Laplace transform will provide a broader understand-
ing of circuit functions.
In this chapter, we introduce the Laplace transform, discuss
its pertinent characteristics, and present a systematic method for
transforming from the frequency domain to the time domain.

As we learned in Chapter 9, power delivered from electrical
wall outlets in the U.S. can be modeled as a sinusoidal volt-
age or current source, where the frequency of the sinusoid is
60 Hz. The phasor concepts introduced in Chapter 9 allowed
us to analyze the steady-state response of a circuit to a sinu-
soidal source.
It is often important to pay attention to the complete
response of a circuit to a sinusoidal source. Remember that the
complete response has two parts—the steady-state response
that takes the same form as the input to the circuit, and the
transient response that decays to zero as time progresses.
When the source for a circuit is modeled as a 60 Hz sinusoid,
the steady-state response is also a 60 Hz sinusoid whose mag-
nitude and phase angle can be calculated using phasor circuit
analysis. The transient response depends on the components
that make up the circuit, the values of those components, and
the way the components are interconnected. The voltage and
current for every component in a circuit is the sum of a tran-
sient part and a steady-state part, once the source is switched
into the circuit.
While the transient part of the voltage and current even-
tually decays to zero, initially this transient part, when added
to the steady-state part, may exceed the voltage or current
rating of the circuit component. This is why it is important to
be able to determine the complete response of a circuit. The
Laplace transform techniques introduced in this chapter can
be used to find the complete response of a circuit to a sinu-
soidal source.
Consider the RLC circuit shown below, comprised of
components from Appendix H and powered by a 60 Hz sinu-
soidal source. As detailed in Appendix H, the 10 mH induc-
tor has a current rating of 40 mA. The amplitude of the
sinusoidal source has been chosen so that this rating is met
in the steady state (see Problem 12.54). Once we have pre-
sented the Laplace transform method, we will be able to
determine whether or not this current rating is exceeded
when the source is first switched on and both the transient
and steady-state components of the inductor current are
active.

Introduction to the Laplace Transform
12.1 Definition of the Laplace
Transform
The Laplace transform of a function is given by the expression
(12.1)
where the symbol 
is read “the Laplace transform of 
”
The Laplace transform of 
is also denoted 
that is,
(12.2)
This notation emphasizes that when the integral in Eq. 12.1 has been evalu-
ated, the resulting expression is a function of s. In our applications, t repre-
sents the time domain, and, because the exponent of e in the integral of
Eq. 12.1 must be dimensionless,s must have the dimension of reciprocal time,
or frequency. The Laplace transform transforms the problem from the time
domain to the frequency domain. After obtaining the frequency-domain
expression for the unknown,we inverse-transform it back to the time domain.
If the idea behind the Laplace transform seems foreign, consider
another familiar mathematical transform. Logarithms are used to change a
multiplication or division problem, such as 
into a simpler addition
or subtraction problem:
Antilogs are
used to carry out the inverse process.The phasor is another transform; as we
know from Chapter 9, it converts a sinusoidal signal into a complex number
for easier, algebraic computation of circuit values. After determining the
phasor value of a signal, we transform it back to its time-domain expression.
Both of these examples point out the essential feature of mathematical
transforms: They are designed to create a new domain to make the mathe-
matical manipulations easier.After finding the unknown in the new domain,
we inverse-transform it back to the original domain. In circuit analysis, we
use the Laplace transform to transform a set of integrodifferential equations
from the time domain to a set of algebraic equations in the frequency
domain. We therefore simplify the solution for an unknown quantity to the
manipulation of a set of algebraic equations.
Before we illustrate some of the important properties of the Laplace
transform, some general comments are in order. First, note that the inte-
gral in Eq. 12.1 is improper because the upper limit is infinite.Thus we are
confronted immediately with the question of whether the integral con-
verges. In other words, does a given 
have a Laplace transform?
Obviously, the functions of primary interest in engineering analysis have
Laplace transforms; otherwise we would not be interested in the trans-
form. In linear circuit analysis, we excite circuits with sources that have
Laplace transforms. Excitation functions such as 
or 
which do not
have Laplace transforms, are of no interest here.
Second, because the lower limit on the integral is zero, the Laplace
transform ignores 
for negative values of t. Put another way,
is
determined by the behavior of 
only for positive values of t.To empha-
size that the lower limit is zero, Eq. 12.1 is frequently referred to as the
one-sided, or unilateral, Laplace transform. In the two-sided, or bilateral,
Laplace transform, the lower limit is 
We do not use the bilateral
form here; hence 
is understood to be the one-sided transform.
Another point regarding the lower limit concerns the situation when
has a discontinuity at the origin. If 
is continuous at the origin—as,

for example, in Fig. 12.1(a)—
is not ambiguous. However, if 
has a
finite discontinuity at the origin—as, for example, in Fig. 12.1(b)—the
question arises as to whether the Laplace transform integral should
include or exclude the discontinuity. In other words, should we make the
lower limit 
and include the discontinuity, or should we exclude the dis-
continuity by making the lower limit 
? (We use the notation 
and 
to
denote values of t just to the left and right of the origin, respectively.)
Actually, we may choose either as long as we are consistent. For reasons to
be explained later, we choose 
as the lower limit.
Because we are using 
as the lower limit, we note immediately that
the integration from 
to 
is zero. The only exception is when the dis-
continuity at the origin is an impulse function, a situation we discuss in
Section 12.3. The important point now is that the two functions shown in
Fig. 12.1 have the same unilateral Laplace transform because there is no
impulse function at the origin.
The one-sided Laplace transform ignores 
for 
What hap-
pens prior to 
is accounted for by the initial conditions. Thus we use the
Laplace transform to predict the response to a disturbance that occurs
after initial conditions have been established.
In the discussion that follows, we divide the Laplace transforms into
two types: functional transforms and operational transforms.A functional
transform is the Laplace transform of a specific function, such as 
t,
and so on. An operational transform defines a general mathematical
property of the Laplace transform, such as finding the transform of the
derivative of 
Before considering functional and operational trans-
forms, however, we need to introduce the step and impulse functions.
12.2 The Step Function
We may encounter functions that have a discontinuity, or jump, at the ori-
gin. For example, we know from earlier discussions of transient behavior
that switching operations create abrupt changes in currents and voltages.
We accommodate these discontinuities mathematically by introducing the
step and impulse functions.
Figure 12.2 illustrates the step function. It is zero for 
. The sym-
bol for the step function is Ku(t). Thus, the mathematical definition of the
step function is
(12.3)
If K is 1, the function defined by Eq. 12.3 is the unit step.
The step function is not defined at 
In situations where we need to
define the transition between 
and 
we assume that it is linear and that
(12.4)
As before,
and 
represent symmetric points arbitrarily close to the
left and right of the origin. Figure 12.3 illustrates the linear transition from
to 
A discontinuity may occur at some time other than 
for exam-
ple, in sequential switching. A step that occurs at 
is expressed as

Introduction to the Laplace Transform
If 
the step occurs to the right of the origin, and if 
the step
occurs to the left of the origin. Figure 12.4 illustrates Eq. 12.5. Note that
the step function is 0 when the argument 
is negative, and it is K
when the argument is positive.
A step function equal to K for 
is written as 
Thus
(12.6)
The discontinuity is to the left of the origin when 
Equation 12.6 is
shown in Fig. 12.5.
One application of the step function is to use it to write the mathe-
matical expression for a function that is nonzero for a finite duration but is
defined for all positive time. One example useful in circuit analysis is a
finite-width pulse, which we can create by adding two step functions. The
function 
has the value K for 
and the
value 0 everywhere else, so it is a finite-width pulse of height K initiated at
and terminated at 
In defining this pulse using step functions,
it is helpful to think of the step function 
as “turning on” the con-
stant value K at 
and the step function 
as “turning off” the
constant value K at 
We use step functions to turn on and turn off
linear functions at desired times in Example 12.1.

The function shown in Fig. 12.6 is made up of linear

struct this function, we must add and subtract linear
functions of the proper slope.We use the step func-
tion to initiate and terminate these linear segments
at the proper times. In other words, we use the step

When we have a finite discontinuity in a function, such as that illustrated
in Fig. 12.1(b), the derivative of the function is not defined at the point of
the discontinuity.The concept of an impulse function1 enables us to define
the derivative at a discontinuity, and thus to define the Laplace transform
of that derivative. An impulse is a signal of infinite amplitude and zero
duration. Such signals don’t exist in nature, but some circuit signals come
very close to approximating this definition, so we find a mathematical
model of an impulse useful. Impulsive voltages and currents occur in cir-
cuit analysis either because of a switching operation or because the circuit
is excited by an impulsive source. We will analyze these situations in
Chapter 13, but here we focus on defining the impulse function generally.
To define the derivative of a function at a discontinuity, we first assume
that the function varies linearly across the discontinuity, as shown in 
Fig. 12.8, where we observe that as 
an abrupt discontinuity occurs at
the origin. When we differentiate the function, the derivative between 
and 
is constant at a value of 
For
the derivative is 
Figure 12.9 shows these observations graphically.As approaches zero, the
value of 
between 
approaches infinity. At the same time, the dura-
tion of this large value is approaching zero. Furthermore, the area under
between 
remains constant as 
In this example, the area is
unity. As 
approaches zero, we say that the function between 
approaches a unit impulse function,denoted 
Thus the derivative of 
at the origin approaches a unit impulse function as approaches zero, or
If the area under the impulse function curve is other than unity, the
impulse function is denoted 
where K is the area. K is often referred
to as the strength of the impulse function.
To summarize, an impulse function is created from a variable-parameter
function whose parameter approaches zero. The variable-parameter func-
tion must exhibit the following three characteristics as the parameter
approaches zero:
1. The amplitude approaches infinity.
2. The duration of the function approaches zero.
3. The area under the variable-parameter function is constant as the
parameter changes.
Many different variable-parameter functions have the aforementioned
characteristics. In Fig. 12.8, we used a linear function 
Another example of a variable-parameter function is the expo-
nential function:
(12.7)
As approaches zero, the function becomes infinite at the origin and at the
same time decays to zero in an infinitesimal length of time. Figure 12.10
illustrates the character of 
as

we must also show that the area under the function is
independent of 
Thus,
(12.8)
which tells us that the area under the curve is constant and equal to K units.
Therefore, as 
Mathematically, the impulse function is defined
(12.9)
(12.10)
Equation 12.9 states that the area under the impulse function is constant.
This area represents the strength of the impulse. Equation 12.10 states
that the impulse is zero everywhere except at 
An impulse that
occurs at 
is denoted 
The graphic symbol for the impulse function is an arrow. The strength
of the impulse is given parenthetically next to the head of the arrow.
Figure 12.11 shows the impulses 
and 
An important property of the impulse function is the sifting property,
which is expressed as
(12.11)
where the function 
is assumed to be continuous at 
that is, at the
location of the impulse. Equation 12.11 shows that the impulse function
sifts out everything except the value of 
at 
The validity of
Eq. 12.11 follows from noting that 
is zero everywhere except at
and hence the integral can be written
(12.12)
But because 
is continuous at a, it takes on the value 
as 
so
(12.13)
We use the sifting property of the impulse function to find its Laplace
transform:
(12.14)
which is an important Laplace transform pair that we make good use of in
circuit analysis.

We can also define the derivatives of the impulse function and the
Laplace transform of these derivatives. We discuss the first derivative,
along with its transform and then state the result for the higher-order
derivatives.
The function illustrated in Fig. 12.12(a) generates an impulse function
as 
Figure 12.12(b) shows the derivative of this impulse-generating
function, which is defined as the derivative of the impulse 
as 
The derivative of the impulse function sometimes is referred to as a
moment function, or unit doublet.
To find the Laplace transform of 
we simply apply the defining
integral to the function shown in Fig. 12.12(b) and, after integrating, let
Then
(12.15)
In deriving Eq. 12.15, we had to use l’Hôpital’s rule twice to evaluate the
indeterminate form 
Higher-order derivatives may be generated in a manner similar to
that used to generate the first derivative (see Problem 12.6), and the defin-
ing integral may then be used to find its Laplace transform. For the nth
derivative of the impulse function, we find that its Laplace transform sim-
ply is 
that is,
(12.16)
Finally, an impulse function can be thought of as a derivative of a step
function; that is,
(12.17)
Figure 12.13 presents the graphic interpretation of Eq. 12.17.The function
shown in Fig. 12.13(a) approaches a unit step function as 
The func-
tion shown in Fig.
12.13(b)—the derivative of the function in
Fig. 12.13(a)—approaches a unit impulse as 
The impulse function is an extremely useful concept in circuit analy-
sis, and we say more about it in the following chapters. We introduced the
concept here so that we can include discontinuities at the origin in our def-
inition of the Laplace transform.
NOTE: Assess your understanding of the impulse function by trying

12.4 Functional Transforms
A functional transform is simply the Laplace transform of a specified
function of t. Because we are limiting our introduction to the unilat-
eral, or one-sided, Laplace transform, we define all functions to be zero
for 
We derived one functional transform pair in Section 12.3, where
we showed that the Laplace transform of the unit impulse function
equals 1; (see Eq. 12.14). A second illustration is the unit step function
of Fig. 12.13(a), where
(12.18)
Equation 12.18 shows that the Laplace transform of the unit step function
is 
The Laplace transform of the decaying exponential function shown in
Fig. 12.14 is
(12.19)
In deriving Eqs. 12.18 and 12.19, we used the fact that integration across
the discontinuity at the origin is zero.
A third illustration of finding a functional transform is the sinusoidal
function shown in Fig. 12.15. The expression for 
for 
is 
hence the Laplace transform is
(12.20)
Table 12.1 gives an abbreviated list of Laplace transform pairs. It
includes the functions of most interest in an introductory course on cir-
cuit applications.

Operational transforms indicate how mathematical operations performed
on either 
or 
are converted into the opposite domain. The opera-
tions of primary interest are (1) multiplication by a constant; (2) addition
(subtraction); (3) differentiation; (4) integration; (5) translation in the time
domain; (6) translation in the frequency domain; and (7) scale changing.

Introduction to the Laplace Transform
Addition (Subtraction)
Addition (subtraction) in the time domain translates into addition (sub-
traction) in the frequency domain.Thus if
then
(12.22)
which is derived by simply substituting the algebraic sum of time-domain
functions into the defining integral.
Differentiation
Differentiation in the time domain corresponds to multiplying 
by s
and then subtracting the initial value of 
—that is,
—from 
this product:
(12.23)
which is obtained directly from the definition of the Laplace transform, or
(12.24)
We evaluate the integral in Eq. 12.24 by integrating by parts. Letting
and 
yields
(12.25)
Because we are assuming that 
is Laplace transformable, the evalua-
tion of 
at 
is zero.Therefore the right-hand side of Eq. 12.25
reduces to
This observation completes the derivation of Eq. 12.23. It is an important
result because it states that differentiation in the time domain reduces to
an algebraic operation in the s domain.
We determine the Laplace transform of higher-order derivatives by
using Eq. 12.23 as the starting point. For example, to find the Laplace
transform of the second derivative of 
we first let

Introduction to the Laplace Transform
The integration-by-parts formula yields
(12.32)
The first term on the right-hand side of Eq. 12.32 is zero at both the upper
and lower limits. The evaluation at the lower limit obviously is zero,
whereas the evaluation at the upper limit is zero because we are assuming
that 
has a Laplace transform. The second term on the right-hand side
of Eq. 12.32 is 
therefore
(12.33)
which reveals that the operation of integration in the time domain is trans-
formed to the algebraic operation of multiplying by 
in the s domain.
Equation 12.33 and Eq. 12.30 form the basis of the earlier statement that
the Laplace transform translates a set of integrodifferential equations into
a set of algebraic equations.
Translation in the Time Domain
If we start with any function 
we can represent the same function,
translated in time by the constant a, as 
2. Translation in
the time domain corresponds to multiplication by an exponential in the
frequency domain.Thus
(12.34)
For example, knowing that
Eq. 12.34 permits writing the Laplace transform of 
directly:
The proof of Eq. 12.34 follows from the defining integral:

In writing Eq. 12.35, we took advantage of

we change the variable of integration. Specifically, we let

12.6
Applying the Laplace Transform
441
We begin by writing the integrodifferential equation that 
must
satisfy. We need only a single node-voltage equation to describe the cir-
cuit. Summing the currents away from the top node in the circuit gener-
ates the equation:
(12.38)
Note that in writing Eq. 12.38, we indicated the opening of the switch in
the step jump of the source current from zero to 
After deriving the integrodifferential equations (in this example, just
one), we transform the equations to the s domain. We will not go through
the steps of the transformation in detail, because in Chapter 13 we will dis-
cover how to bypass them and generate the s-domain equations directly.
Briefly though, we use three operational transforms and one functional
transform on Eq. 12.38 to obtain
(12.39)
an algebraic equation in which 
is the unknown variable. We are
assuming that the circuit parameters R, L, and C, as well as the source cur-
rent 
are known; the initial voltage on the capacitor 
is zero
because the initial energy stored in the circuit is zero. Thus we have
reduced the problem to solving an algebraic equation.
Next we solve the algebraic equations (again, just one in this case) for
the unknowns. Solving Eq. 12.39 for 
gives
(12.40)
To find 
we must inverse-transform the expression for 
We

The next step in the analysis is to find the inverse transform of the 
s-domain expression; this is the subject of Section 12.7. In that section
we also present a final, critical step: checking the validity of the result-
ing time-domain expression. The need for such checking is not unique
to the Laplace transform; conscientious and prudent engineers always
test any derived solution to be sure it makes sense in terms of known
system behavior.
Simplifying the notation now is advantageous. We do so by dropping
the parenthetical t in time-domain expressions and the parenthetical s in
frequency-domain expressions.We use lowercase letters for all time-domain

NOTE: Assess your understanding of this material by trying Chapter
Problem 12.26.
12.7 Inverse Transforms
The expression for 
in Eq. 12.40 is a rational function of s; that is, one
that can be expressed in the form of a ratio of two polynomials in s such
that no nonintegral powers of s appear in the polynomials. In fact, for lin-
ear, lumped-parameter circuits whose component values are constant, the
s-domain expressions for the unknown voltages and currents are always
rational functions of s. (You may verify this observation by working
Problems 12.27–12.30.) If we can inverse-transform rational functions of s,
we can solve for the time-domain expressions for the voltages and cur-
rents. The purpose of this section is to present a straight-forward and sys-
tematic technique for finding the inverse transform of a rational function.
In general, we need to find the inverse transform of a function that
has the form
(12.42)
The coefficients a and b are real constants, and the exponents m and n are
positive integers. The ratio 
is called a proper rational function
if 
and an improper rational function if 
Only a proper
rational function can be expanded as a sum of partial fractions. This
restriction poses no problem, as we show at the end of this section.
Partial Fraction Expansion: Proper Rational Functions
A proper rational function is expanded into a sum of partial fractions by
writing a term or a series of terms for each root of 
Thus 
must
be in factored form before we can make a partial fraction expansion. For
each distinct root of 
a single term appears in the sum of partial frac-
tions. For each multiple root of 
of multiplicity r, the expansion con-
tains r terms. For example, in the rational function
the denominator has four roots. Two of these roots are distinct—namely,
at 
and 
A multiple root of multiplicity 2 occurs at 
Thus the partial fraction expansion of this function takes the form

Inverse Transforms

The key to the partial fraction technique for finding inverse transforms
lies in recognizing the 
corresponding to each term in the sum of par-
tial fractions. From Table 12.1 you should be able to verify that
(12.44)
All that remains is to establish a technique for determining the coeffi-
cients (
) generated by making a partial fraction expansion.
There are four general forms this problem can take. Specifically, the roots
of 
are either (1) real and distinct; (2) complex and distinct; (3) real
and repeated; or (4) complex and repeated. Before we consider each situ-
ation in turn, a few general comments are in order.
We used the identity sign
in Eq. 12.43 to emphasize that expanding
a rational function into a sum of partial fractions establishes an identical
equation. Thus both sides of the equation must be the same for all values
of the variable s.Also, the identity relationship must hold when both sides
are subjected to the same mathematical operation. These characteristics
are pertinent to determining the coefficients, as we will see.
Be sure to verify that the rational function is proper. This check is
important because nothing in the procedure for finding the various Ks will
alert you to nonsense results if the rational function is improper. We pres-
ent a procedure for checking the Ks, but you can avoid wasted effort by
forming the habit of asking yourself,“Is 
a proper rational function?”
Partial Fraction Expansion: Distinct Real Roots of D(s)
We first consider determining the coefficients in a partial fraction expan-
sion when all the roots of 
are real and distinct.To find a K associated
with a term that arises because of a distinct root of 
we multiply both
sides of the identity by a factor equal to the denominator beneath the
desired K.Then when we evaluate both sides of the identity at the root cor-
responding to the multiplying factor, the right-hand side is always the
desired K,and the left-hand side is always its numerical value. For example,
(12.45)
To find the value of 
we multiply both sides by s and then evaluate both
sides at

From Eq. 12.45 and the K values obtained,

At this point, testing the result to protect against computational errors is a
good idea. As we already mentioned, a partial fraction expansion creates
an identity; thus both sides of Eq. 12.49 must be the same for all s values.
The choice of test values is completely open; hence we choose values that
are easy to verify. For example, in Eq. 12.49, testing at either

attractive because in both cases the left-hand side reduces to zero.

Partial Fraction Expansion: Distinct Complex 
Roots of D(s)
The only difference between finding the coefficients associated with dis-
tinct complex roots and finding those associated with distinct real roots is
that the algebra in the former involves complex numbers.We illustrate by
expanding the rational function:
(12.51)
We begin by noting that 
is a proper rational function. Next we must
find the roots of the quadratic term 
:
(12.52)
With the denominator in factored form, we proceed as before:

To find 
and 
we use the same process as before:

Again, we need to make some observations. First, in physically realiz-
able circuits, complex roots always appear in conjugate pairs. Second, the
coefficients associated with these conjugate pairs are themselves conju-
gates. Note, for example, that

Introduction to the Laplace Transform
(Eq. 12.55). Thus for complex conjugate roots, you actually need to calcu-
late only half the coefficients.
Before inverse-transforming Eq. 12.57, we check the partial fraction
expansion numerically. Testing at 
is attractive because the left-hand
side reduces to zero at this value:
We now proceed to inverse-transform Eq. 12.57:
(12.58)
In general, having the function in the time domain contain imaginary com-
ponents is undesirable. Fortunately, because the terms involving imaginary
components always come in conjugate pairs, we can eliminate the imagi-
nary components simply by adding the pairs:
(12.59)
which enables us to simplify Eq. 12.58:
(12.60)
Because distinct complex roots appear frequently in lumped-parameter
linear circuit analysis, we need to summarize these results with a new
transform pair. Whenever 
contains distinct complex roots—that is,
factors of the form 
—a pair of terms of the form
(12.61)
appears in the partial fraction expansion, where the partial fraction coeffi-
cient is, in general, a complex number. In polar form,

Partial Fraction Expansion: Repeated Real Roots of D(s)
To find the coefficients associated with the terms generated by a multiple
root of multiplicity r, we multiply both sides of the identity by the multiple
root raised to its rth power.We find the K appearing over the factor raised
to the rth power by evaluating both sides of the identity at the multiple root.
To find the remaining 
coefficients, we differentiate both sides of the
identity 
times. At the end of each differentiation, we evaluate both
sides of the identity at the multiple root. The right-hand side is always the
desired K, and the left-hand side is always its numerical value. For example,

We handle repeated complex roots in the same way that we did repeated

Partial Fraction Expansion: Improper Rational Functions
We conclude the discussion of partial fraction expansions by returning
to an observation made at the beginning of this section, namely, that
improper rational functions pose no serious problem in finding inverse
transforms. An improper rational function can always be expanded into
a polynomial plus a proper rational function. The polynomial is then
inverse-transformed into impulse functions and derivatives of impulse
functions. The proper rational function is inverse-transformed by the
techniques outlined in this section. To illustrate the procedure, we use
the function
(12.85)
Dividing the denominator into the numerator until the remainder is a
proper rational function gives
(12.86)
where the term 
is the remainder.
Next we expand the proper rational function into a sum of 
partial fractions:

The rational function of Eq. 12.42 also may be expressed as the ratio of
two factored polynomials. In other words, we may write 
as

where K is the constant 
For example, we may also write the function
as

The roots of the denominator polynomial, that is,
are called the poles of F(s); they are the values of s at which

The roots of the numerator polynomial, that is,
are called the zeros of F(s); they are the values of s at which

Initial- and Final-Value Theorems
453
In what follows, you may find that being able to visualize the poles
and zeros of 
as points on a complex s plane is helpful. A complex
plane is needed because the roots of the polynomials may be complex. In
the complex s plane, we use the horizontal axis to plot the real values of s
and the vertical axis to plot the imaginary values of s.
As an example of plotting the poles and zeros of 
consider 
the function
(12.92)
The poles of 
are at 0,
and 
The zeros are at 
and 
Figure 12.17 shows the poles and zeros plotted on
the s plane, where X’s represent poles and O’s represent zeros.
Note that the poles and zeros for Eq. 12.90 are located in the finite s
plane.
can also have either an rth-order pole or an rth-order zero at
infinity. For example, the function described by Eq. 12.91 has a second-
order zero at infinity, because for large values of s the function reduces to
and 
when 
In this text, we are interested in the poles
and zeros located in the finite s plane. Therefore, when we refer to the
poles and zeros of a rational function of s, we are referring to the finite
poles and zeros.
12.9 Initial- and Final-Value Theorems
The initial- and final-value theorems are useful because they enable us to
determine from 
the behavior of 
at 0 and 
. Hence we can check
the initial and final values of 
to see if they conform with known circuit
behavior, before actually finding the inverse transform of 
The initial-value theorem states that
(12.93)
and the final-value theorem states that
(12.94)
The initial-value theorem is based on the assumption that 
contains no
impulse functions. In Eq. 12.94, we must add the restriction that the theo-
rem is valid only if the poles of 
except for a first-order pole at the
origin, lie in the left half of the s plane.
To prove Eq. 12.93, we start with the operational transform of the 
first derivative:
(12.95)
Now we take the limit as

Introduction to the Laplace Transform
Observe that the right-hand side of Eq. 12.96 may be written as
As 
hence the second integral vanishes in the limit.
The first integral reduces to 
which is independent of s. Thus
the right-hand side of Eq. 12.96 becomes
(12.97)
Because 
is independent of s, the left-hand side of Eq. 12.96 may
be written
(12.98)
From Eqs. 12.97 and 12.98,
which completes the proof of the initial-value theorem.
The proof of the final-value theorem also starts with Eq. 12.95. Here
we take the limit as 
:
(12.99)
The integration is with respect to t and the limit operation is with respect
to s, so the right-hand side of Eq. 12.99 reduces to
(12.100)
Because the upper limit on the integral is infinite, this integral may also be
written as a limit process:
(12.101)
where we use y as the symbol of integration to avoid confusion with the
upper limit on the integral. Carrying out the integration process yields
(12.102)
Substituting Eq. 12.102 into Eq. 12.99 gives
(12.103)
Because 
cancels,Eq.12.103 reduces to the final-value theorem,namely,
The final-value theorem is useful only if 
exists.This condition is true
only if all the poles of

The Application of Initial- and Final-Value Theorems
To illustrate the application of the initial- and final-value theorems, we
apply them to a function we used to illustrate partial fraction expan-
sions. Consider the transform pair given by Eq. 12.60. The initial-value
theorem gives
The final-value theorem gives
In applying the theorems to Eq. 12.60, we already had the time-domain
expression and were merely testing our understanding. But the real value of
the initial- and final-value theorems lies in being able to test the s-domain
expressions before working out the inverse transform. For example, con-
sider the expression for 
given by Eq. 12.40.Although we cannot calcu-
late 
until the circuit parameters are specified, we can check to see if
predicts the correct values of 
and 
We know from the
statement of the problem that generated 
that 
is zero. We also
know that 
must be zero because the ideal inductor is a perfect short
circuit across the dc current source. Finally, we know that the poles of 
must lie in the left half of the s plane because R, L, and C are positive con-
stants. Hence the poles of 
also lie in the left half of the s plane.
Applying the initial-value theorem yields

Finally, we can use Table 12.3 to calculate the inverse Laplace transform of
Eq. 12.107 to give 
:
iL(t)
(12.109)
iL(t) = 147.14e -750t cos(661.44t - 97.89°) + 36.69 cos(120pt + 56.61°) mA
The first term of Eq. 12.109 is the transient response, which will decay to
essentially zero in about 7 ms. The second term of Eq. 12.109 is the steady-
state response, which has the same frequency as the 60 Hz sinusoidal source
and will persist so long as this source is connected in the circuit. Note that
the amplitude of the steady-state response is 36.69 mA, which is less than
the 40 mA current rating of the inductor. But the transient response has an

the circuit, in the clockwise direction:

Now we take the Laplace transform of Eq. 12.104, using Tables 12.1 and 12.2:

initial amplitude of 147.14 mA, far greater than the 40 mA current rating.
Calculate the value of the inductor current at 
:
Clearly, the transient part of the response does not cause the inductor current to
exceed its rating initially. But we need a plot of the complete response to deter-
mine whether or not the current rating is ever exceeded, as shown in Fig. 12.19.
The plot suggests we check the value of the inductor current at 1 ms:

iL(0.001) = 147.14e -0.75 cos(-59.82°) + 36.69 cos(78.21°) = 42.6 mA
Thus, the current rating is exceeded in the inductor, at least momentarily. If
we determine that we never want to exceed the current rating, we should
reduce the magnitude of the sinusoidal source. This example illustrates the
importance of considering the complete response of a circuit to a sinusoidal
input, even if we are satisfied with the steady-state response.

The Laplace transform has two characteristics that make it an
attractive tool in circuit analysis. First, it transforms a set of linear
constant-coefficient differential equations into a set of linear
polynomial equations, which are easier to manipulate. Second, it
automatically introduces into the polynomial equations the initial
values of the current and voltage variables. Thus, initial condi-
tions are an inherent part of the transform process. (This con-
trasts with the classical approach to the solution of differential
equations, in which initial conditions are considered when the
unknown coefficients are evaluated.)
We begin this chapter by showing how we can skip the step of
writing time-domain integrodifferential equations and transform-
ing them into the s domain. In Section 13.1, we’ll develop the 
s-domain circuit models for resistors, inductors, and capacitors so
that we can write s-domain equations for all circuits directly.
Section 13.2 reviews Ohm’s and Kirchhoff’s laws in the context of
the s domain.After establishing these fundamentals, we apply the
Laplace transform method to a variety of circuit problems in
Section 13.3.
Analytical and simplification techniques first introduced with
resistive circuits—such as mesh-current and node-voltage methods
and source transformations—can be used in the s domain as well.
After solving for the circuit response in the s domain, we inverse
transform back to the time domain, using partial fraction expansion
(as demonstrated in the preceding chapter). As before,checking the
final time-domain equations in terms of the initial conditions and
final values is an important step in the solution process.
The s-domain descriptions of circuit input and output lead us,
in Section 13.4, to the concept of the transfer function.The trans-
fer function for a particular circuit is the ratio of the Laplace
transform of its output to the Laplace transform of its input. In
Chapters 14 and 15, we’ll examine the design uses of the transfer
function, but here we focus on its use as an analytical tool. We
continue this chapter with a look at the role of partial fraction

CHAPTER

With the advent of home-based personal computers, modems,
fax machines, and other sensitive electronic equipment, it is
necessary to provide protection from voltage surges that can
occur in a household circuit due to switching. A commer-
cially available surge suppressor is shown in the accompany-
ing figure.
How can flipping a switch to turn on a light or turn off a
hair dryer cause a voltage surge? At the end of this chapter,
we will answer that question using Laplace transform tech-
niques to analyze a circuit. We will illustrate how a voltage
surge can be created by switching off a resistive load in a cir-
cuit operating in the sinusoidal steady state.

employing the transfer function in circuit analysis. We conclude with a
look at the impulse function in circuit analysis.
13.1 Circuit Elements in the s Domain
The procedure for developing an s-domain equivalent circuit for each cir-
cuit element is simple. First, we write the time-domain equation that
relates the terminal voltage to the terminal current. Next, we take the
Laplace transform of the time-domain equation. This step generates an
algebraic relationship between the s-domain current and voltage. Note that
the dimension of a transformed voltage is volt-seconds, and the dimension
of a transformed current is ampere-seconds. A voltage-to-current ratio in
the s domain carries the dimension of volts per ampere. An impedance 
in the s domain is measured in ohms, and an admittance is measured in
siemens. Finally, we construct a circuit model that satisfies the relation-
ship between the s-domain current and voltage. We use the passive sign
convention in all the derivations.
A Resistor in the s Domain
We begin with the resistance element. From Ohm’s law,
(13.1)
Because R is a constant, the Laplace transform of Eq. 13.1 is
(13.2)
where
Equation 13.2 states that the s-domain equivalent circuit of a resistor is
simply a resistance of R ohms that carries a current of I ampere-seconds
and has a terminal voltage of V volt-seconds.
Figure 13.1 shows the time- and frequency-domain circuits of the
resistor. Note that going from the time domain to the frequency domain
does not change the resistance element.
An Inductor in the s Domain
Figure 13.2 shows an inductor carrying an initial current of 
amperes.
The time-domain equation that relates the terminal voltage to the termi-
nal current is

Circuit Elements in the s Domain

Two different circuit configurations satisfy Eq. 13.4. The first consists
of an impedance of sL ohms in series with an independent voltage source
of 
volt-seconds, as shown in Fig. 13.3. Note that the polarity marks on
the voltage source 
agree with the minus sign in Eq. 13.4. Note also
that 
carries its own algebraic sign; that is, if the initial value of i is
opposite to the reference direction for i, then 
has a negative value.
The second s-domain equivalent circuit that satisfies Eq. 13.4 consists
of an impedance of sL ohms in parallel with an independent current
source of 
ampere-seconds, as shown in Fig. 13.4. We can derive the
alternative equivalent circuit shown in Fig. 13.4 in several ways. One way
is simply to solve Eq. 13.4 for the current I and then construct the circuit to
satisfy the resulting equation.Thus
(13.5)
Two other ways are: (1) find the Norton equivalent of the circuit shown in
Fig. 13.3 and (2) start with the inductor current as a function of the induc-
tor voltage and then find the Laplace transform of the resulting integral
equation.We leave these two approaches to Problems 13.1 and 13.2.
If the initial energy stored in the inductor is zero, that is, if 
the
s-domain equivalent circuit of the inductor reduces to an inductor with an
impedance of sL ohms. Figure 13.5 shows this circuit.
A Capacitor in the s Domain
An initially charged capacitor also has two s-domain equivalent circuits.
Figure 13.6 shows a capacitor initially charged to 
volts. The terminal
current is
(13.6)
Transforming Eq. 13.6 yields
or
(13.7)
which indicates that the s-domain current I is the sum of two branch cur-
rents. One branch consists of an admittance of sC siemens, and the second
branch consists of an independent current source of 
ampere-seconds.
Figure 13.7 shows this parallel equivalent circuit.
We derive the series equivalent circuit for the charged capacitor by
solving Eq. 13.7 for V:
(13.8)
Figure 13.8 shows the circuit that satisfies Eq. 13.8.
In the equivalent circuits shown in Figs. 13.7 and 13.8,

choose between the parallel or series equivalents when inductors and
capacitors are present. With a little forethought and some experience, the
correct choice will often be quite evident.The equivalent circuits are sum-

13.2 Circuit Analysis in the s Domain
Before illustrating how to use the s-domain equivalent circuits in analysis,
we need to lay some groundwork.
First, we know that if no energy is stored in the inductor or capacitor,
the relationship between the terminal voltage and current for each passive

(13.9)
where Z refers to the s-domain impedance of the element. Thus a resistor
has an impedance of R ohms, an inductor has an impedance of sL ohms,
V = ZI,

and a capacitor has an impedance of 
ohms. The relationship con-
tained in Eq. 13.9 is also contained in Figs. 13.1(b), 13.5, and 13.9.
Equation 13.9 is sometimes referred to as Ohm’s law for the s domain.
The reciprocal of the impedance is admittance.Therefore, the s domain
admittance of a resistor is 
siemens, an inductor has an admittance of
siemens, and a capacitor has an admittance of sC siemens.
The rules for combining impedances and admittances in the s domain
are the same as those for frequency-domain circuits.Thus series-parallel sim-
plifications and -to-Y conversions also are applicable to s-domain analysis.
In addition, Kirchhoff’s laws apply to s-domain currents and voltages.
Their applicability stems from the operational transform stating that the
Laplace transform of a sum of time-domain functions is the sum of the
transforms of the individual functions (see Table 12.2). Because the alge-
braic sum of the currents at a node is zero in the time domain, the alge-
braic sum of the transformed currents is also zero. A similar statement
holds for the algebraic sum of the transformed voltages around a closed
path.The s-domain version of Kirchhoff’s laws is
(13.10)
(13.11)
Because the voltage and current at the terminals of a passive element
are related by an algebraic equation and because Kirchhoff’s laws still
hold, all the techniques of circuit analysis developed for pure resistive
networks may be used in s-domain analysis. Thus node voltages, mesh
currents, source transformations, and Thévenin-Norton equivalents are
all valid techniques, even when energy is stored initially in the inductors
and capacitors. Initially stored energy requires that we modify Eq. 13.9 by
simply adding independent sources either in series or parallel with the
element impedances. The addition of these sources is governed by
Kirchhoff’s laws.

13.3 Applications
We now illustrate how to use the Laplace transform to determine the tran-
sient behavior of several linear lumped-parameter circuits.We start by ana-
lyzing familiar circuits from Chapters 7 and 8 because they represent a
simple starting place and because they show that the Laplace transform
approach yields the same results. In all the examples, the ease of manipulat-
ing algebraic equations instead of differential equations should be apparent.
The Natural Response of an RC Circuit
We first revisit the natural response of an RC circuit (Fig. 13.10) via
Laplace transform techniques. (You may want to review the classical
analysis of this same circuit in Section 7.2).
The capacitor is initially charged to 
volts, and we are interested in
the time-domain expressions for i and .We start by finding i. In transfer-
ring the circuit in Fig. 13.10 to the s domain, we have a choice of two equiv-
alent circuits for the charged capacitor. Because we are interested in the
current, the series-equivalent circuit is more attractive; it results in a single-
mesh circuit in the frequency domain.Thus we construct the s-domain cir-
cuit shown in Fig. 13.11.
Summing the voltages around the mesh generates the expression
(13.12)
Solving Eq. 13.12 for I yields
(13.13)
Note that the expression for I is a proper rational function of s and can be
inverse-transformed by inspection:
(13.14)
which is equivalent to the expression for the current derived by the classi-
cal methods discussed in Chapter 7. In that chapter, the current is given by
Eq. 7.26, where is used in place of RC.
After we have found i, the easiest way to determine 
is simply to
apply Ohm’s law; that is, from the circuit,
(13.15)
We now illustrate a way to find from the circuit without first finding i.
In this alternative approach, we return to the original circuit of Fig. 13.10
and transfer it to the s domain using the parallel equivalent circuit for the
charged capacitor. Using the parallel equivalent circuit is attractive now
because we can describe the resulting circuit in terms of a single node volt-
age. Figure 13.12 shows the new s-domain equivalent circuit.
The node-voltage equation that describes the new circuit is

The Step Response of a Parallel Circuit
Next we analyze the parallel RLC circuit, shown in Fig. 13.13, that we first
analyzed in Example 8.7.The problem is to find the expression for 
after
the constant current source is switched across the parallel elements. The
initial energy stored in the circuit is zero.
As before, we begin by constructing the s-domain equivalent circuit
shown in Fig. 13.14. Note how easily an independent source can be trans-
formed from the time domain to the frequency domain.We transform the
source to the s domain simply by determining the Laplace transform of its
time-domain function. Here, opening the switch results in a step change in
the current applied to the circuit.Therefore the s-domain current source is
or 
To find 
we first solve for V and then use

The Laplace Transform in Circuit Analysis
Substituting Eq. 13.21 into Eq. 13.19 gives
(13.22)
Substituting the numerical values of R, L, C, and 
into Eq. 13.22 yields
(13.23)
Before expanding Eq. 13.23 into a sum of partial fractions, we factor the
quadratic term in the denominator:
(13.24)
Now, we can test the s-domain expression for 
by checking to see
whether the final-value theorem predicts the correct value for 
at
All the poles of 
except for the first-order pole at the origin, lie
in the left half of the s plane, so the theorem is applicable. We know from
the behavior of the circuit that after the switch has been open for a long
time, the inductor will short-circuit the current source.Therefore, the final
value of 
must be 24 mA.The limit of 
as 
is
(13.25)
(Currents in the s domain carry the dimension of ampere-seconds, so the
dimension of 
will be amperes.) Thus our s-domain expression checks out.
We now proceed with the partial fraction expansion of Eq. 13.24:
(13.26)
The partial fraction coefficients are
(13.27)
(13.28)
Substituting the numerical values of 
and 
into Eq. 13.26 and inverse-
transforming the resulting expression yields
(13.29)
The answer given by Eq. 13.29 is equivalent to the answer given for
Example 8.7 because
If we weren’t using a previous solution as a check, we would test
Eq. 13.29 to make sure that 
satisfied the given initial conditions and
satisfied the known behavior of the circuit.

The Use of Thévenin’s Equivalent
In this section we show how to use Thévenin’s equivalent in the s domain.
Figure 13.17 shows the circuit to be analyzed. The problem is to find the
capacitor current that results from closing the switch.The energy stored in
the circuit prior to closing is zero.
To find 
we first construct the s-domain equivalent circuit and then
find the Thévenin equivalent of this circuit with respect to the terminals of
the capacitor. Figure 13.18 shows the s-domain circuit.
The Thévenin voltage is the open-circuit voltage across terminals a, b.
Under open-circuit conditions, there is no voltage across the 
resis-
tor. Hence
(13.56)
The Thévenin impedance seen from terminals a and b equals the 
resistor in series with the parallel combination of the 
resistor and the
2 mH inductor.Thus
(13.57)
Using the Thévenin equivalent, we reduce the circuit shown in Fig. 13.18
to the one shown in Fig. 13.19. It indicates that the capacitor current 
equals the Thévenin voltage divided by the total series impedance.Thus,
(13.58)
We simplify Eq. 13.58 to
(13.59)
A partial fraction expansion of Eq. 13.59 generates
(13.60)
the inverse transform of which is
(13.61)
We now test Eq. 13.61 to see whether it makes sense in terms of
known circuit behavior. From Eq. 13.61,
(13.62)
This result agrees with the initial current in the capacitor, as calculated from
the circuit in Fig. 13.17. The initial inductor current is zero and the initial
capacitor voltage is zero, so the initial capacitor current is 
or 6 A.
The final value of the current is zero, which also agrees with Eq. 13.61. Note
also from this equation that the current reverses sign when t exceeds
or 
The fact that 
reverses sign makes sense because,
when the switch first closes, the capacitor begins to charge. Eventually this
charge is reduced to zero because the inductor is a short circuit at 
The sign reversal of 
reflects the charging and discharging of the capacitor.
Let’s assume that the voltage drop across the capacitor 
is also of inter-
est. Once we know

We now transform this circuit to the s domain.In so doing,we note that

(13.67)
Because we plan to use mesh analysis in the s domain, we use the series
equivalent circuit for an inductor carrying an initial current. Figure 13.22
shows the s-domain circuit. Note that there is only one independent volt-
age source.This source appears in the vertical leg of the tee to account for
the initial value of the current in the 2 H inductor of 
or 5 A.
The branch carrying 
has no voltage source because 
The two s-domain mesh equations that describe the circuit in
Fig. 13.22 are

Solving for

Expanding Eq. 13.70 into a sum of partial fractions generates
(13.71)
Then,
(13.72)
Equation 13.72 reveals that 
increases from zero to a peak value of
481.13 mA in 549.31 ms after the switch is moved to position b.Thereafter,
decreases exponentially toward zero. Figure 13.23 shows a plot of 
ver-
sus t. This response makes sense in terms of the known physical behavior
of the magnetically coupled coils. A current can exist in the 
inductor
only if there is a time-varying current in the 
inductor. As 
decreases
from its initial value of 5 A,
increases from zero and then approaches
zero as 
approaches zero.

The Use of Superposition
Because we are analyzing linear lumped-parameter circuits, we can use
superposition to divide the response into components that can be identi-
fied with particular sources and initial conditions. Distinguishing these
components is critical to being able to use the transfer function, which we
introduce in the next section.
Figure 13.24 shows our illustrative circuit. We assume that at the
instant when the two sources are applied to the circuit, the inductor is car-
rying an initial current of 
amperes and that the capacitor is carrying an
initial voltage of 
volts. The desired response of the circuit is the voltage
across the resistor 
labeled 
Figure 13.25 shows the s-domain equivalent circuit. We opted for the
parallel equivalents for L and C because we anticipated solving for 
using the node-voltage method.
To find 
by superposition, we calculate the component of 
result-
ing from each source acting alone, and then we sum the components. We
begin with 
acting alone. Opening each of the three current sources
deactivates them. Figure 13.26 shows the resulting circuit. We added the
node voltage 
to aid the analysis. The primes on 
and 
indicate that
they are the components of 
and 
attributable to 
acting alone. The
two equations that describe the circuit in Fig. 13.26 are
(13.73)
(13.74)
For convenience, we introduce the notation
(13.75)
(13.76)
(13.77)
Substituting Eqs. 13.75–13.77 into Eqs. 13.73 and 13.74 gives
(13.78)
(13.79)
Solving Eqs. 13.78 and 13.79 for 
gives
(13.80)

reduces to the one shown in Fig. 13.27. Here,

13.4 The Transfer Function
The transfer function is defined as the s-domain ratio of the Laplace trans-
form of the output (response) to the Laplace transform of the input
(source). In computing the transfer function, we restrict our attention to
circuits where all initial conditions are zero. If a circuit has multiple inde-
pendent sources, we can find the transfer function for each source and use
superposition to find the response to all sources.
The transfer function is
(13.93)
where 
is the Laplace transform of the output signal, and 
is the
Laplace transform of the input signal. Note that the transfer function
depends on what is defined as the output signal. Consider, for example,
the series circuit shown in Fig. 13.30. If the current is defined as the
response signal of the circuit,
(13.94)
In deriving Eq. 13.94, we recognized that I corresponds to the output 
and 
corresponds to the input X(s).

The Transfer Function
483
If the voltage across the capacitor is defined as the output signal of the
circuit shown in Fig. 13.30, the transfer function is
(13.95)
Thus, because circuits may have multiple sources and because the definition
of the output signal of interest can vary, a single circuit can generate many
transfer functions. Remember that when multiple sources are involved, no
single transfer function can represent the total output—transfer functions
associated with each source must be combined using superposition to yield
the total response. Example 13.1 illustrates the computation of a transfer
function for known numerical values of R, L, and C.

The Location of Poles and Zeros of H(s)
For linear lumped-parameter circuits,
is always a rational function
of s. Complex poles and zeros always appear in conjugate pairs. The
poles of 
must lie in the left half of the s plane if the response to a
bounded source (one whose values lie within some finite bounds) is to
be bounded. The zeros of 
may lie in either the right half or the left
half of the s plane.
With these general characteristics in mind, we next discuss the role
that 
plays in determining the response function. We begin with the
partial fraction expansion technique for finding 
13.5 The Transfer Function 
in Partial Fraction Expansions
From Eq. 13.93 we can write the circuit output as the product of the trans-
fer function and the driving function:
(13.96)
We have already noted that 
is a rational function of s. Reference to
Table 13.1 shows that 
also is a rational function of s for the excitation
functions of most interest in circuit analysis.
Expanding the right-hand side of Eq. 13.96 into a sum of partial frac-
tions produces a term for each pole of 
and 
Remember from
Chapter 12 that poles are the roots of the denominator polynomial; zeros
are the roots of the numerator polynomial. The terms generated by the
poles of 
give rise to the transient component of the total response,
whereas the terms generated by the poles of 
give rise to the steady-
state component of the response. By steady-state response, we mean the
response that exists after the transient components have become negligi-
ble. Example 13.2 illustrates these general observations.

Observations on the Use of H(s) in Circuit Analysis
Example 13.2 clearly shows how the transfer function
relates to the
response of a circuit through a partial fraction expansion. However, the
example raises questions about the practicality of driving a circuit with an
increasing ramp voltage that generates an increasing ramp response.
Eventually the circuit components will fail under the stress of excessive
voltage, and when that happens our linear model is no longer valid. The
ramp response is of interest in practical applications where the ramp
function increases to a maximum value over a finite time interval. If the
time taken to reach this maximum value is long compared with the time
constants of the circuit, the solution assuming an unbounded ramp is
valid for this finite time interval.
We make two additional observations regarding Eq. 13.96. First, let’s
look at the response of the circuit due to a delayed input. If the input is
delayed by a seconds,
and, from Eq. 13.96, the response becomes
(13.97)
If 
then, from Eq. 13.97,
(13.98)
Therefore, delaying the input by a seconds simply delays the response
function by a seconds. A circuit that exhibits this characteristic is said to
be time invariant.
Second, if a unit impulse source drives the circuit, the response of the
circuit equals the inverse transform of the transfer function.Thus if
and

Y(s) = H(s)X(s)e-as.

The Transfer Function and the Convolution Integral
487
Hence, from Eq. 13.99,
(13.100)
where the inverse transform of the transfer function equals the unit
impulse response of the circuit. Note that this is also the natural response
of the circuit because the application of an impulsive source is equivalent
to instantaneously storing energy in the circuit (see Section 13.8). The
subsequent release of this stored energy gives rise to the natural response
(see Problem 13.82).
Actually, the unit impulse response of a circuit,
contains enough
information to compute the response to any source that drives the circuit.
The convolution integral is used to extract the response of a circuit to an
arbitrary source as demonstrated in the next section.
13.6 The Transfer Function and the
Convolution Integral
The convolution integral relates the output 
of a linear time-invariant
circuit to the input 
of the circuit and the circuit’s impulse response
The integral relationship can be expressed in two ways:
(13.101)
We are interested in the convolution integral for several reasons.
First, it allows us to work entirely in the time domain. Doing so may be
beneficial in situations where 
and 
are known only through
experimental data. In such cases, the transform method may be awkward
or even impossible, as it would require us to compute the Laplace trans-
form of experimental data. Second, the convolution integral introduces
the concepts of memory and the weighting function into analysis. We will
show how the concept of memory enables us to look at the impulse
response (or the weighting function) 
and predict, to some degree,
how closely the output waveform replicates the input waveform. Finally,
the convolution integral provides a formal procedure for finding the
inverse transform of products of Laplace transforms.
We based the derivation of Eq. 13.101 on the assumption that the cir-
cuit is linear and time invariant. Because the circuit is linear, the principle
of superposition is valid, and because it is time invariant, the amount of
the response delay is exactly the same as that of the input delay. Now con-
sider Fig. 13.34, in which the block containing 
represents any linear
time-invariant circuit whose impulse response is known,
represents
the excitation signal and 
represents the desired output signal.
We assume that 
is the general excitation signal shown in
Fig. 13.35(a). For convenience we also assume that 
for 
Once you see the derivation of the convolution integral assuming
for 
the extension of the integral to include excitation
functions that exist over all time becomes apparent. Note also that we
permit a discontinuity in 
at the origin, that is, a jump between 
and 0+.

Now we approximate

where

between

step functions; that is,

is to make 
small
enough that the ith component can be approximated by an impulse func-
tion of strength 
Figure 13.35(c) shows the impulse representa-
tion, with the strength of each impulse shown in brackets beside each
arrow.The impulse representation of 
is
(13.103)
Now when 
is represented by a series of impulse functions
(which occur at equally spaced intervals of time, that is, at 
),
the response function 
consists of the sum of a series of uniformly
delayed impulse responses. The strength of each response depends on
the strength of the impulse driving the circuit. For example, let’s assume
that the unit impulse response of the circuit contained in the box in 
Fig. 13.34 is the exponential decay function shown in Fig. 13.36(a). Then
the approximation of 
is the sum of the impulse responses shown in
Fig. 13.36(b).

The Transfer Function and the Convolution Integral

which is the second form of the convolution integral given in Eq. 13.101.
We derive the first form of the integral from Eq. 13.107 by making a
change in the variable of integration.We let 
and then we note
that 
when 
and 
when 
Now we can write Eq. 13.107 as
or
(13.108)
But because u is just a symbol of integration, Eq. 13.108 is equivalent to
the first form of the convolution integral, Eq. 13.101.
The integral relationship between 
and 
expressed in
Eq. 13.101, often is written in a shorthand notation:

where the asterisk signifies the integral relationship between

Thus

The integrals in Eq. 13.101 give the most general relationship for the
convolution of two functions. However, in our applications of the convolu-
tion integral, we can change the lower limit to zero and the upper limit to
t.Then we can write Eq. 13.101 as
(13.110)
We change the limits for two reasons. First, for physically realizable
circuits,
is zero for 
In other words, there can be no impulse
response before an impulse is applied. Second, we start measuring
time at the instant the excitation 
is turned on; therefore 
for 
A graphic interpretation of the convolution integrals contained in
Eq. 13.110 is important in the use of the integral as a computational
tool. We begin with the first integral. For purposes of discussion, we
assume that the impulse response of our circuit is the exponential decay
function shown in Fig. 13.37(a) and that the excitation function has the
waveform shown in Fig. 13.37(b). In each of these plots, we replaced t
with 
the symbol of integration. Replacing 
with 
simply folds the
excitation function over the vertical axis, and replacing 
with 
slides the folded function to the right. See Figures 13.37(c) and (d). This

folding operation gives rise to the term convolution. At any specified
value of t, the response function 
is the area under the product func-
tion

and folded excitation function shown in
Fig. 13.40, which are helpful in selecting the lim-
its on the convolution integral. Sliding the
folded excitation function to the right requires
breaking the integration into three intervals:
and 
The

dictate these break points. Figure 13.41 shows

The Concepts of Memory and the Weighting Function
We mentioned at the beginning of this section that the convolution inte-
gral introduces the concepts of memory and the weighting function into
circuit analysis. The graphic interpretation of the convolution integral is
the easiest way to begin to grasp these concepts. We can view the folding
and sliding of the excitation function on a timescale characterized as past,
present, and future. The vertical axis, over which the excitation function
is folded, represents the present value; past values of 
lie to the
right of the vertical axis, and future values lie to the left. Figure 13.43
shows this description of 
For illustrative purposes, we used the excita-
tion function from Example 13.3.
When we combine the past, present, and future views of 
with
the impulse response of the circuit, we see that the impulse response
weights 
according to present and past values. For example, Fig. 13.41
shows that the impulse response in Example 13.3 gives less weight to past
values of 
than to the present value of 
In other words, the circuit
retains less and less about past input values. Therefore, in Fig. 13.42,
quickly approaches zero when the present value of the input is zero (that
is, when 
). In other words, because the present value of the input
receives more weight than the past values, the output quickly approaches
the present value of the input.

Figure 13.44  Weighting functions. (a) Perfect mem-

The multiplication of 
by 
gives rise to the practice of
referring to the impulse response as the circuit weighting function. The
weighting function, in turn, determines how much memory the circuit has.
Memory is the extent to which the circuit’s response matches its input. For
example, if the impulse response, or weighting function, is flat, as shown in
Fig. 13.44(a), it gives equal weight to all values of 
past and present.
Such a circuit has a perfect memory. However, if the impulse response is
an impulse function, as shown in Fig. 13.44(b), it gives no weight to past
values of 
Such a circuit has no memory.Thus the more memory a cir-
cuit has, the more distortion there is between the waveform of the excita-
tion function and the waveform of the response function.We can show this
relationship by assuming that the circuit has no memory, that is,
and then noting from the convolution integral that
(13.111)
Equation 13.111 shows that, if the circuit has no memory, the output is a
scaled replica of the input.
The circuit shown in Example 13.3 illustrates the distortion between input
and output for a circuit that has some memory.This distortion is clear when we
plot the input and output waveforms on the same graph,as in Fig.13.45.
13.7 The Transfer Function and the
Steady-State Sinusoidal Response
Once we have computed a circuit’s transfer function, we no longer need to
perform a separate phasor analysis of the circuit to determine its steady-
state response. Instead, we use the transfer function to relate the steady-
state response to the excitation source. First we assume that

The Laplace Transform in Circuit Analysis
Substituting Eq. 13.114 into Eq. 13.96 gives the s-domain expression for
the response:

We now visualize the partial fraction expansion of Eq. 13.115.The number
of terms in the expansion depends on the number of poles of 
Because 
is not specified beyond being the transfer function of a
physically realizable circuit, the expansion of Eq. 13.115 is

In Eq. 13.116, the first two terms result from the complex conjugate poles
of the driving source; that is,
However, the
terms generated by the poles of 
do not contribute to the steady-state
response of 
because all these poles lie in the left half of the s plane;
consequently, the corresponding time-domain terms approach zero as t
increases. Thus the first two terms on the right-hand side of Eq. 13.116
determine the steady-state response. The problem is reduced to finding
the partial fraction coefficient

The Laplace Transform in Circuit Analysis
13.8 The Impulse Function in 
Circuit Analysis
Impulse functions occur in circuit analysis either because of a switching
operation or because a circuit is excited by an impulsive source. The
Laplace transform can be used to predict the impulsive currents and volt-
ages created during switching and the response of a circuit to an impulsive
source. We begin our discussion by showing how to create an impulse
function with a switching operation.
Switching Operations
We use two different circuits to illustrate how an impulse function can be
created with a switching operation: a capacitor circuit, and a series induc-
tor circuit.
Capacitor Circuit
In the circuit shown in Fig. 13.47, the capacitor 
is charged to an initial
voltage of 
at the time the switch is closed. The initial charge on 
is
zero. The problem is to find the expression for 
as 
Figure 13.48
shows the s-domain equivalent circuit.
From Fig. 13.48,
(13.121)
where the equivalent capacitance 
is replaced by 
.
We inverse-transform Eq. 13.121 by inspection to obtain
(13.122)
which indicates that as R decreases, the initial current 
increases
and the time constant 
decreases.Thus, as R gets smaller, the current
starts from a larger initial value and then drops off more rapidly.
Figure 13.49 shows these characteristics of i.
Apparently i is approaching an impulse function as R approaches zero
because the initial value of i is approaching infinity and the duration of i is
approaching zero. We still have to determine whether the area under the
current function is independent of R. Physically, the total area under the
i versus t curve represents the total charge transferred to 
after the switch
is closed.Thus
(13.123)
which says that the total charge transferred to 
is independent of R and
equals 
coulombs.Thus, as R approaches zero, the current approaches
an impulse strength

The Impulse Function in Circuit Analysis

The physical interpretation of Eq. 13.124 is that when 
a finite
amount of charge is transferred to 
instantaneously. Making R zero in
the circuit shown in Fig. 13.47 shows why we get an instantaneous transfer
of charge.With 
we create a contradiction when we close the switch;
that is, we apply a voltage across a capacitor that has a zero initial voltage.
The only way to have an instantaneous change in capacitor voltage is to
have an instantaneous transfer of charge. When the switch is closed, the
voltage across 
does not jump to 
but to its final value of
(13.125)
We leave the derivation of Eq. 13.125 to you (see Problem 13.81).
If we set R equal to zero at the outset, the Laplace transform analysis
will predict the impulsive current response.Thus,
(13.126)
In writing Eq. 13.126, we use the capacitor voltages at 
The inverse
transform of a constant is the constant times the impulse function; there-
fore, from Eq. 13.126,
(13.127)
The ability of the Laplace transform to predict correctly the occurrence of an
impulsive response is one reason why the transform is widely used to analyze
the transient behavior of linear lumped-parameter time-invariant circuits.
Series Inductor Circuit
The circuit shown in Fig. 13.50 illustrates a second switching operation
that produces an impulsive response. The problem is to find the time-
domain expression for 
after the switch has been opened. Note that
opening the switch forces an instantaneous change in the current of 
which causes 
to contain an impulsive component.
Figure 13.51 shows the s-domain equivalent with the switch open. In
deriving this circuit, we recognized that the current in the 3 H inductor at
is 10 A, and the current in the 2 H inductor at 
is zero. Using
the initial conditions at 
is a direct consequence of our using 
as
the lower limit on the defining integral of the Laplace transform.
We derive the expression for 
from a single node-voltage equation.
Summing the currents away from the node between the 
resistor and
the 30 V source gives

The Laplace Transform in Circuit Analysis
Solving for 
yields
(13.129)
We anticipate that 
will contain an impulse term because the second
term on the right-hand side of Eq. 13.129 is an improper rational function.
We can express this improper fraction as a constant plus a rational func-
tion by simply dividing the denominator into the numerator; that is,
(13.130)
Combining Eq. 13.130 with the partial fraction expansion of the first term
on the right-hand side of Eq. 13.129 gives
(13.131)
from which
(13.132)
Does this solution make sense? Before answering that question, let’s
first derive the expression for the current when 
After the switch has
been opened, the current in 
is the same as the current in 
If we refer-
ence the current clockwise around the mesh, the s-domain expression is
(13.133)
Inverse-transforming Eq. 13.133 gives
(13.134)
Before the switch is opened, the current in 
is 10 A, and the current
in 
is 0 A; from Eq. 13.134 we know that at 
the current in 
and
in 
is 6 A.Then, the current in 
changes instantaneously from 10 to 6 A,
while the current in 
changes instantaneously from 0 to 6 A. From this
value of 6 A, the current decreases exponentially to a final value of 4 A.

This final value is easily verified from the circuit; that is, it should equal
or 4 A. Figure 13.52 shows these characteristics of 
and 
How can we verify that these instantaneous jumps in the inductor cur-
rent make sense in terms of the physical behavior of the circuit? First, we
note that the switching operation places the two inductors in series. Any
impulsive voltage appearing across the 3 H inductor must be exactly bal-
anced by an impulsive voltage across the 2 H inductor, because the sum of
the impulsive voltages around a closed path must equal zero. Faraday’s
law states that the induced voltage is proportional to the change in flux
linkage (
). Therefore, the change in flux linkage must sum to
zero. In other words, the total flux linkage immediately after switching is
the same as that before switching. For the circuit here, the flux linkage
before switching is
(13.135)
Immediately after switching, it is
(13.136)
Combining Eqs. 13.135 and 13.136 gives
(13.137)
Thus the solution for i (Eq. [13.134]) agrees with the principle of the con-
servation of flux linkage.
We now test the validity of Eq. 13.132. First we check the impulsive
term 
The instantaneous jump of 
from 0 to 6 A at 
gives rise
to an impulse of strength 
in the derivative of 
This impulse gives
rise to the 
in the voltage across the 2 H inductor. For 
is 
therefore, the voltage 
is
(13.138)
Equation 13.138 agrees with the last two terms on the right-hand side of
Eq. 13.132; thus we have confirmed that Eq. 13.132 does make sense in
terms of known circuit behavior.
We can also check the instantaneous drop from 10 to 6 A in the cur-
rent 
This drop gives rise to an impulse of 
in the derivative of 
Therefore the voltage across 
contains an impulse of 
at the ori-
gin.This impulse exactly balances the impulse across 
that is, the sum of
the impulsive voltages around a closed path equals zero.
Impulsive Sources
Impulse functions can occur in sources as well as responses; such sources
are called impulsive sources.An impulsive source driving a circuit imparts
a finite amount of energy into the system instantaneously. A mechanical
analogy is striking a bell with an impulsive clapper blow.After the energy
has been transferred to the bell, the natural response of the bell deter-
mines the tone emitted (that is, the frequency of the resulting sound
waves) and the tone’s duration.

The Laplace Transform in Circuit Analysis
In the circuit shown in Fig. 13.53, an impulsive voltage source having a
strength of 
volt-seconds is applied to a series connection of a resistor
and an inductor. When the voltage source is applied, the initial energy in
the inductor is zero; therefore the initial current is zero.There is no voltage
drop across R, so the impulsive voltage source appears directly across L.
An impulsive voltage at the terminals of an inductor establishes an instan-
taneous current.The current is
(13.139)
Given that the integral of 
over any interval that includes zero is 1, we
find that Eq. 13.139 yields
(13.140)
Thus, in an infinitesimal moment, the impulsive voltage source has
stored in the inductor.
(13.141)
The current 
now decays to zero in accordance with the natural
response of the circuit; that is,
(13.142)
where 
Remember from Chapter 7 that the natural response is
attributable only to passive elements releasing or storing energy, and not
to the effects of sources. When a circuit is driven by only an impulsive
source, the total response is completely defined by the natural response;
the duration of the impulsive source is so infinitesimal that it does not
contribute to any forced response.
We may also obtain Eq. 13.142 by direct application of the Laplace
transform method. Figure 13.54 shows the s-domain equivalent of the cir-
cuit in Fig. 13.53.
Hence
(13.143)
(13.144)
Thus the Laplace transform method gives the correct solution for 
Finally, we consider the case in which internally generated impulses
and externally applied impulses occur simultaneously. The Laplace trans-
form approach automatically ensures the correct solution for 
if
inductor currents and capacitor voltages at 
are used in constructing
the s-domain equivalent circuit and if externally applied impulses are rep-
resented by their transforms. To illustrate, we add an impulsive voltage

We may also find the abrupt changes in 
and 
without using super-
position. The sum of the impulsive voltages across 
(3 H) and 
(2 H)
equals 
Thus the change in flux linkage must sum to 50; that is,
(13.150)
Because 
we express Eq. 13.150 as
(13.151)
But because 
and 
must be equal after the switching takes place,
(13.152)
Then,
(13.153)
Solving Eqs. 13.151 and 13.153 for 
and 
yields
(13.154)
(13.155)
These expressions agree with the previous check.
Figure 13.57 also indicates that the derivatives of 
will contain
an impulse at 
Specifically, the derivative of 
will have an impulse
of 
and the derivative of 
will have an impulse of 
Figure 13.58(a), (b), respectively, illustrate the derivatives of 
and 
Now let’s turn to Eq. 13.148. The impulsive component 
agrees
with the impulse 
that characterizes 
at the origin. The term
agrees with the fact that for 
We test the impulsive component of 
by noting that it produces
an impulsive voltage of 
or 
across 
This voltage, along
with 
across 
adds to 
Thus the algebraic sum of the impul-
sive voltages around the mesh adds to zero.
To summarize, the Laplace transform will correctly predict the creation
of impulsive currents and voltages that arise from switching. However, the 
s-domain equivalent circuits must be based on initial conditions at 
that is, on the initial conditions that exist prior to the disturbance caused by
the switching. The Laplace transform will correctly predict the response to
impulsive driving sources by simply representing these sources in the 
s domain by their correct transforms.
NOTE: Assess your understanding of the impulse function in circuit
analysis by trying Chapter Problems 13.88 and 13.90.

Practical Perspective
Surge Suppressors
As mentioned at the beginning of this chapter, voltage surges can occur in
a circuit that is operating in the sinusoidal steady state. Our purpose is to
show how the Laplace transform is used to determine the creation of a surge
in voltage between the line and neutral conductors of a household circuit
when a load is switched off during sinusoidal steady-state operation.
Consider the circuit shown in Fig. 13.59, which models a household cir-
cuit with three loads, one of which is switched off at time 
. To simplify
the analysis, we assume that the line-to-neutral voltage, 
,
is
, a standard household voltage, and that when the load 
is switched off at 
, the value of 
does not change. After the switch
is opened, we can construct the s-domain circuit, as shown in Fig. 13.60.
Note that because the phase angle of the voltage across the inductive load
is 
, the initial current through the inductive load is 0. Therefore, only the
inductance in the line has a non-zero initial condition, which is modeled in
the s-domain circuit as a voltage source with the value 
, as seen in
Fig. 13.60.
Just before the switch is opened at 
, each of the loads has a
steady-state sinusoidal voltage with a peak magnitude of 
.
All of the current flowing through the line from the voltage source 
is
divided among the three loads. When the switch is opened at 
, all of
the current in the line will flow through the remaining resistive load. This is
because the current in the inductive load is at 
and the current in an
inductor cannot change instantaneously. Therefore, the voltage drop across
the remaining loads can experience a surge as the line current is directed
through the resistive load. For example, if the initial current in the line is
and the impedance of the resistive load is 
, the voltage
drop across the resistor surges from 
to 
when the switch is opened. If the resistive load cannot handle this amount
of voltage, it needs to be protected with a surge suppressor such as those
shown at the beginning of the chapter.

The Laplace Transform in Circuit Analysis
Summary
•
We can represent each of the circuit elements as an 
s-domain equivalent circuit by Laplace-transforming
the voltage-current equation for each element:
•
Resistor:
•
Inductor:
•
Capacitor:
In these equations,
is the ini-
tial current through the inductor, and 
is the initial
voltage across the capacitor. (See pages 466–467.)
•
We can perform circuit analysis in the s domain by
replacing each circuit element with its s-domain equiva-
lent circuit. The resulting equivalent circuit is solved by
writing algebraic equations using the circuit analysis
techniques from resistive circuits. Table 13.1 summa-
rizes the equivalent circuits for resistors, inductors, and
capacitors in the s domain. (See page 468.)
•
Circuit analysis in the s domain is particularly advanta-
geous for solving transient response problems in linear
lumped parameter circuits when initial conditions are
known. It is also useful for problems involving multiple
simultaneous mesh-current or node-voltage equations,
because it reduces problems to algebraic rather than
differential equations. (See pages 474–476.)
•
The transfer function is the s-domain ratio of a circuit’s
output to its input. It is represented as
where 
is the Laplace transform of the output sig-
nal, and 
is the Laplace transform of the input sig-
nal. (See page 482.)
•
The partial fraction expansion of the product 
yields a term for each pole of 
and 
The 
terms correspond to the transient component of
the total response; the 
terms correspond to the
steady-state component. (See page 484.)
•
If a circuit is driven by a unit impulse,
then
the response of the circuit equals the inverse Laplace
transform of the transfer function,
(See pages 486–487.)

•
A time-invariant circuit is one for which, if the input is
delayed by a seconds, the response function is also
delayed by a seconds. (See page 486.)
•
The output of a circuit,
can be computed by con-
volving the input,
with the impulse response of the
circuit,
A graphical interpretation of the convolution integral
often provides an easier computational method to gen-
erate 
(See page 487.)
•
We can use the transfer function of a circuit to compute
its steady-state response to a sinusoidal source.To do so,
make the substitution 
in 
and represent the
resulting complex number as a magnitude and phase
angle. If
then
(See page 494.)
•
Laplace transform analysis correctly predicts impulsive
currents and voltages arising from switching and impul-
sive sources.You must ensure that the s-domain equiva-
lent circuits are based on initial conditions at 
that is, prior to the switching. (See page 496.)

Up to this point in our analysis of circuits with sinusoidal
sources, the source frequency was held constant. In this chapter,
we analyze the effect of varying source frequency on circuit volt-
ages and currents. The result of this analysis is the frequency
response of a circuit.
We’ve seen in previous chapters that a circuit’s response
depends on the types of elements in the circuit, the way the ele-
ments are connected, and the impedance of the elements.
Although varying the frequency of a sinusoidal source does not
change the element types or their connections, it does alter the
impedance of capacitors and inductors, because the impedance
of these elements is a function of frequency. As we will see, the
careful choice of circuit elements, their values, and their con-
nections to other elements enables us to construct circuits that
pass to the output only those input signals that reside in a
desired range of frequencies.
Such circuits are called
frequency-selective circuits. Many devices that communicate
via electric signals, such as telephones, radios, televisions, and
satellites, employ frequency-selective circuits.
Frequency-selective circuits are also called filters because of
their ability to filter out certain input signals on the basis of fre-
quency. Figure 14.1 on page 522 represents this ability in a sim-
plistic way. To be more accurate, we should note that no practical
frequency-selective circuit can perfectly or completely filter out
selected frequencies. Rather, filters attenuate—that is, weaken or
lessen the effect of—any input signals with frequencies outside
frequencies outside a particular frequency band. Your home
stereo system may have a graphic equalizer, which is an excellent
example of a collection of filter circuits. Each band in the graphic
equalizer is a filter that amplifies sounds (audible frequencies) in
the frequency range of the band and attenuates frequencies out-
side of that band. Thus the graphic equalizer enables you to
change the sound volume in each frequency band.

In this chapter, we examine circuits in which the source fre-
quency varies. The behavior of these circuits varies as the
source frequency varies, because the impedance of the reac-
tive components is a function of the source frequency. These
frequency-dependent circuits are called filters and are used
in many common electrical devices. In radios, filters are used
to select one radio station’s signal while rejecting the signals
from others transmitting at different frequencies. In stereo
systems, filters are used to adjust the relative strengths of the
low- and high-frequency components of the audio signal.
Filters are also used throughout telephone systems.
A pushbutton telephone produces tones that you hear
when you press a button. You may have wondered about these
tones. How are they used to tell the telephone system which
button was pushed? Why are tones used at all? Why do the
tones sound musical? How does the phone system tell the dif-
ference between button tones and the normal sounds of peo-
ple talking or singing?
The telephone system was designed to handle audio
signals—those with frequencies between 300 Hz and 3 kHz.
Thus, all signals from the system to the user have to be
audible—including the dial tone and the busy signal. Similarly,
all signals from the user to the system have to be audible,
including the signal that the user has pressed a button. It is
important to distinguish button signals from the normal audio
signal, so a dual-tone-multiple-frequency (DTMF) design is
employed. When a number button is pressed, a unique pair of
sinusoidal tones with very precise frequencies is sent by the
phone to the telephone system. The DTMF frequency and timing
specifications make it unlikely that a human voice could pro-
duce the exact tone pairs, even if the person were trying. In
the central telephone facility, electric circuits monitor the
audio signal, listening for the tone pairs that signal a number.
In the Practical Perspective example at the end of the chapter,
we will examine the design of the DTMF filters used to deter-
mine which button has been pushed.

Introduction to Frequency Selective Circuits
We begin this chapter by analyzing circuits from each of the four
major categories of filters: low pass, high pass, band pass, and band reject.
The transfer function of a circuit is the starting point for the frequency
response analysis. Pay close attention to the similarities among the trans-
fer functions of circuits that perform the same filtering function. We will
employ these similarities when designing filter circuits in Chapter 15.
14.1 Some Preliminaries
Recall from Section 13.7 that the transfer function of a circuit provides an
easy way to compute the steady-state response to a sinusoidal input. There,
we considered only fixed-frequency sources.To study the frequency response
of a circuit, we replace a fixed-frequency sinusoidal source with a varying-
frequency sinusoidal source.The transfer function is still an immensely useful
tool because the magnitude and phase of the output signal depend only on
the magnitude and phase of the transfer function 
Note that the approach just outlined assumes that we can vary the fre-
quency of a sinusoidal source without changing its magnitude or phase
angle. Therefore, the amplitude and phase of the output will vary only if
those of the transfer function vary as the frequency of the sinusoidal
source is changed.
To further simplify this first look at frequency-selective circuits, we will
also restrict our attention to cases where both the input and output signals
are sinusoidal voltages, as illustrated in Fig. 14.2.Thus, the transfer function
of interest to us will be the ratio of the Laplace transform of the output volt-
age to the Laplace transform of the input voltage, or 
We should keep in mind,however,that for a particular application,a current
may be either the input signal or output signal of interest.
The signals passed from the input to the output fall within a band of
frequencies called the passband. Input voltages outside this band have
their magnitudes attenuated by the circuit and are thus effectively pre-
vented from reaching the output terminals of the circuit. Frequencies not
in a circuit’s passband are in its stopband. Frequency-selective circuits are
categorized by the location of the passband.
One way of identifying the type of frequency-selective circuit is to
examine a frequency response plot.A frequency response plot shows how
a circuit’s transfer function (both amplitude and phase) changes as the
source frequency changes.A frequency response plot has two parts. One is
a graph of 
versus frequency 
This part of the plot is called the
magnitude plot.The other part is a graph of 
versus frequency 
This
part is called the phase angle plot.
The ideal frequency response plots for the four major categories of fil-
ters are shown in Fig. 14.3. Parts (a) and (b) illustrate the ideal plots for a
low-pass and a high-pass filter, respectively. Both filters have one pass-
band and one stopband, which are defined by the cutoff frequency that
separates them. The names low pass and high pass are derived from the
magnitude plots: a low-pass filter passes signals at frequencies lower than
the cutoff frequency from the input to the output, and a high-pass filter
passes signals at frequencies higher than the cutoff frequency. Thus the
terms low and high as used here do not refer to any absolute values of fre-
quency, but rather to relative values with respect to the cutoff frequency.
Note from the graphs for both these filters (as well as those for the
bandpass and bandreject filters) that the phase angle plot for an ideal filter
varies linearly in the passband. It is of no interest outside the passband
because there the magnitude is zero. Linear phase variation is necessary to
avoid phase distortion.

(d) An ideal bandreject filter.
The two remaining categories of filters each have two cutoff frequen-
cies. Figure 14.3(c) illustrates the ideal frequency response plot of a
bandpass filter, which passes a source voltage to the output only when the
source frequency is within the band defined by the two cutoff frequencies.
Figure 14.3(d) shows the ideal plot of a bandreject filter, which passes a
source voltage to the output only when the source frequency is outside the
band defined by the two cutoff frequencies. The bandreject filter thus
rejects, or stops, the source voltage from reaching the output when its fre-
quency is within the band defined by the cutoff frequencies.
In specifying a realizable filter using any of the circuits from this chap-
ter, it is important to note that the magnitude and phase angle characteris-
tics are not independent. In other words, the characteristics of a circuit
that result in a particular magnitude plot will also dictate the form of the
phase angle plot and vice versa. For example, once we select a desired
form for the magnitude response of a circuit, the phase angle response is
also determined. Alternatively, if we select a desired form for the phase
angle response, the magnitude response is also determined. Although
there are some frequency-selective circuits for which the magnitude and
phase angle behavior can be independently specified, these circuits are
not presented here.
The next sections present examples of circuits from each of the four
filter categories.They are a few of the many circuits that act as filters.You
should focus your attention on trying to identify what properties of a cir-
cuit determine its behavior as a filter. Look closely at the form of the
transfer function for circuits that perform the same filtering functions.
Identifying the form of a filter’s transfer function will ultimately help you
in designing filtering circuits for particular applications.
All of the filters we will consider in this chapter are passive filters, so
called because their filtering capabilities depend only on the passive

Introduction to Frequency Selective Circuits
elements: resistors, capacitors, and inductors. The largest output amplitude
such filters can achieve is usually 1, and placing an impedance in series with
the source or in parallel with the load will decrease this amplitude. Because
many practical filter applications require increasing the amplitude of the
output, passive filters have some significant disadvantages. The only pas-
sive filter described in this chapter that can amplify its output is the series
RLC resonant filter.A much greater selection of amplifying filters is found
among the active filter circuits, the subject of Chapter 15.
14.2 Low-Pass Filters
Here, we examine two circuits that behave as low-pass filters, the series
RL circuit and the series RC circuit, and discover what characteristics of
these circuits determine the cutoff frequency.
The Series RL Circuit—Qualitative Analysis
A series RL circuit is shown in Fig. 14.4(a). The circuit’s input is a sinu-
soidal voltage source with varying frequency. The circuit’s output is
defined as the voltage across the resistor. Suppose the frequency of the
source starts very low and increases gradually.We know that the behavior
of the ideal resistor will not change, because its impedance is independent
of frequency. But consider how the behavior of the inductor changes.
Recall that the impedance of an inductor is 
At low frequencies,
the inductor’s impedance is very small compared with the resistor’s
impedance, and the inductor effectively functions as a short circuit. The
term low frequencies thus refers to any frequencies for which 
The equivalent circuit for 
is shown in Fig. 14.4(b). In this equivalent
circuit, the output voltage and the input voltage are equal both in magni-
tude and in phase angle.
As the frequency increases,the impedance of the inductor increases rel-
ative to that of the resistor. Increasing the inductor’s impedance causes a
corresponding increase in the magnitude of the voltage drop across the
inductor and a corresponding decrease in the output voltage magnitude.
Increasing the inductor’s impedance also introduces a shift in phase angle
between the inductor’s voltage and current.This results in a phase angle dif-
ference between the input and output voltage. The output voltage lags the
input voltage, and as the frequency increases, this phase lag approaches 
At high frequencies, the inductor’s impedance is very large compared
with the resistor’s impedance, and the inductor thus functions as an open
circuit, effectively blocking the flow of current in the circuit.The term high
frequencies thus refers to any frequencies for which 
The equiv-
alent circuit for 
is shown in Fig. 14.4(c), where the output voltage
magnitude is zero. The phase angle of the output voltage is 
more neg-
ative than that of the input voltage.
Based on the behavior of the output voltage magnitude, this series RL
circuit selectively passes low-frequency inputs to the output, and it blocks
high-frequency inputs from reaching the output. This circuit’s response to
varying input frequency thus has the shape shown in Fig. 14.5. These two
plots comprise the frequency response plots of the series RL circuit in
Fig. 14.4(a). The upper plot shows how 
varies with frequency. The
lower plot shows how 
varies as a function of frequency.We present a
more formal method for constructing these plots in Appendix E.
We have also superimposed the ideal magnitude plot for a low-pass
filter from Fig. 14.3(a) on the magnitude plot of the RL filter in Fig. 14.5.
There is obviously a difference between the magnitude plots of an ideal

filter and the frequency response of an actual RL filter. The ideal filter
exhibits a discontinuity in magnitude at the cutoff frequency,
which
creates an abrupt transition into and out of the passband.While this is, ide-
ally, how we would like our filters to perform, it is not possible to use real
components to construct a circuit that has this abrupt transition in magni-
tude. Circuits acting as low-pass filters have a magnitude response that
changes gradually from the passband to the stopband. Hence the magni-
tude plot of a real circuit requires us to define what we mean by the cutoff
frequency,
Defining the Cutoff Frequency
We need to define the cutoff frequency,
for realistic filter circuits
when the magnitude plot does not allow us to identify a single frequency
that divides the passband and the stopband. The definition for cutoff fre-
quency widely used by electrical engineers is the frequency for which the
transfer function magnitude is decreased by the factor 
from its
maximum value:
(14.1)
where 
is the maximum magnitude of the transfer function. It follows
from Eq. 14.1 that the passband of a realizable filter is defined as the
range of frequencies in which the amplitude of the output voltage is at
least 70.7% of the maximum possible amplitude.
The constant 
used in defining the cutoff frequency may seem like
an arbitrary choice. Examining another consequence of the cutoff frequency
will make this choice seem more reasonable. Recall from Section 10.5 that
the average power delivered by any circuit to a load is proportional to 
where 
is the amplitude of the voltage drop across the load:
(14.2)
If the circuit has a sinusoidal voltage source,
then the load voltage
is also a sinusoid, and its amplitude is a function of the frequency 
Define 
as the value of the average power delivered to a load when
the magnitude of the load voltage is maximum:
(14.3)
If we vary the frequency of the sinusoidal voltage source,
the load
voltage is a maximum when the magnitude of the circuit’s transfer func-
tion is also a maximum:
(14.4)
Now consider what happens to the average power when the frequency of
the voltage source is 
Using Eq. 14.1, we determine the magnitude of
the load voltage at 
to be

Introduction to Frequency Selective Circuits
Substituting Eq. 14.5 into Eq. 14.2,
(14.6)
Equation 14.6 shows that at the cutoff frequency 
the average power
delivered by the circuit is one half the maximum average power. Thus,
is
also called the half-power frequency.Therefore, in the passband, the average
power delivered to a load is at least 50% of the maximum average power.
The Series RL Circuit—Quantitative Analysis
Now that we have defined the cutoff frequency for real filter circuits, we can
analyze the series RL circuit to discover the relationship between the com-
ponent values and the cutoff frequency for this low-pass filter. We begin by
constructing the s-domain equivalent of the circuit in Fig. 14.4(a), assuming
initial conditions of zero.The resulting equivalent circuit is shown in Fig.14.6.
The voltage transfer function for this circuit is
(14.7)
To study the frequency response,we make the substitution 
in Eq.14.7:
(14.8)
We can now separate Eq. 14.8 into two equations. The first defines the
transfer function magnitude as a function of frequency; the second defines
the transfer function phase angle as a function of frequency:
(14.9)
(14.10)
Close examination of Eq. 14.9 provides the quantitative support for
the magnitude plot shown in Fig. 14.5. When 
the denominator and
the numerator are equal and 
This means that at 
the
input voltage is passed to the output terminals without a change in the
voltage magnitude.
As the frequency increases, the numerator of Eq. 14.9 is unchanged,
but the denominator gets larger. Thus 
decreases as the frequency
increases, as shown in the plot in Fig. 14.5. Likewise, as the frequency
increases, the phase angle changes from its dc value of 
becoming more
negative, as seen from Eq. 14.10.

the denominator of Eq. 14.9
is infinite and
as seen in Fig. 14.5. At

limit of 
as seen from Eq. 14.10 and the phase angle plot in Fig. 14.5.

Example 14.1
Designing a Low-Pass Filter
Electrocardiology is the study of the electric signals
produced by the heart. These signals maintain the
heart’s rhythmic beat, and they are measured by an
instrument called an electrocardiograph.This instru-
ment must be capable of detecting periodic signals
whose frequency is about 1 Hz (the normal heart
rate is 72 beats per minute). The instrument must
operate in the presence of sinusoidal noise consisting
of signals from the surrounding electrical environ-
ment, whose fundamental frequency is 60 Hz—the
frequency at which electric power is supplied.
Choose values for R and L in the circuit of
Fig. 14.4(a) such that the resulting circuit could be
used in an electrocardiograph to filter out any
noise above 10 Hz and pass the electric signals
from the heart at or near 1 Hz. Then compute the
magnitude of 
at 1 Hz, 10 Hz, and 60 Hz to see
how well the filter performs.
Solution
The problem is to select values for R and L that
yield a low-pass filter with a cutoff frequency of
10 Hz. From Eq. 14.12, we see that R and L cannot
be specified independently to generate a value for
Therefore, let’s choose a commonly available
value of L, 100 mH. Before we use Eq. 14.12 to
compute the value of R needed to obtain the
desired cutoff frequency, we need to convert the
cutoff frequency from hertz to radians per second:
Now, solve for the value of R which, together with
will yield a low-pass filter with a cut-
off frequency of 10 Hz:

Table 14.1 summarizes the computed magnitude

As expected, the input and output voltages have the
same magnitudes at the low frequency, because the
circuit is a low-pass filter. At the cutoff frequency,
the output voltage magnitude has been reduced by
from the unity passband magnitude. At
60 Hz, the output voltage magnitude has been
reduced by a factor of about 6, achieving the
desired attenuation of the noise that could corrupt
the signal the electrocardiograph is designed to
measure.

Introduction to Frequency Selective Circuits
A Series RC Circuit
The series RC circuit shown in Fig.14.7 also behaves as a low-pass filter.We
can verify this via the same qualitative analysis we used previously. In fact,
such a qualitative examination is an important problem-solving step that
you should get in the habit of performing when analyzing filters. Doing so
will enable you to predict the filtering characteristics (low pass, high pass,
etc.) and thus also predict the general form of the transfer function. If the
calculated transfer function matches the qualitatively predicted form, you
have an important accuracy check.
Note that the circuit’s output is defined as the output across the
capacitor. As we did in the previous qualitative analysis, we use three
frequency regions to develop the behavior of the series RC circuit in
Fig. 14.7:
1. Zero frequency (
): The impedance of the capacitor is infinite,
and the capacitor acts as an open circuit.The input and output volt-
ages are thus the same.
2. Frequencies increasing from zero: The impedance of the capacitor
decreases relative to the impedance of the resistor, and the source
voltage divides between the resistive impedance and the capaci-
tive impedance.The output voltage is thus smaller than the source
voltage.
3. Infinite frequency (
): The impedance of the capacitor is
zero, and the capacitor acts as a short circuit. The output voltage
is thus zero.
Based on this analysis of how the output voltage changes as a function of
frequency, the series RC circuit functions as a low-pass filter. Example 14.2
explores this circuit quantitatively.

Designing a Series RC Low-Pass Filter

Figure 14.9 summarizes the two low-pass filter circuits we have examined.
Look carefully at the transfer functions. Notice how similar in form they
are—they differ only in the terms that specify the cutoff frequency. In fact,
we can state a general form for the transfer functions of these two low-
pass filters:
(14.13)
Any circuit with the voltage ratio in Eq. 14.13 would behave as a low-pass
filter with a cutoff frequency of 
The problems at the end of the chapter
give you other examples of circuits with this voltage ratio.
Relating the Frequency Domain to the Time Domain
Finally, you might have noticed one other important relationship.
Remember our discussion of the natural responses of the first-order RL
and RC circuits in Chapter 6.An important parameter for these circuits is
the time constant, , which characterizes the shape of the time response.
For the RL circuit, the time constant has the value 
(Eq. 7.14); for the
RC circuit, the time constant is RC (Eq. 7.24). Compare the time constants
to the cutoff frequencies for these circuits and notice that
(14.14)
This result is a direct consequence of the relationship between the
time response of a circuit and its frequency response, as revealed by the
Laplace transform. The discussion of memory and weighting as repre-
sented in the convolution integral of Section 13.6 shows that as 
the filter has no memory, and the output approaches a scaled replica of the
input; that is, no filtering has occurred. As 
the filter has increased
memory and the output voltage is a distortion of the input, because filter-
ing has occurred.

14.3 High-Pass Filters
We next examine two circuits that function as high-pass filters. Once
again, they are the series RL circuit and the series RC circuit. We will see
that the same series circuit can act as either a low-pass or a high-pass filter,
depending on where the output voltage is defined.We will also determine
the relationship between the component values and the cutoff frequency
of these filters.
The Series RC Circuit—Qualitative Analysis
A series RC circuit is shown in Fig. 14.10(a). In contrast to its low-pass
counterpart in Fig. 14.7, the output voltage here is defined across the resis-
tor, not the capacitor. Because of this, the effect of the changing capacitive
impedance is different than it was in the low-pass configuration.
At 
the capacitor behaves like an open circuit, so there is no
current flowing in the resistor.This is illustrated in the equivalent circuit in
Fig. 14.10(b). In this circuit, there is no voltage across the resistor, and the
circuit filters out the low-frequency source voltage before it reaches the
circuit’s output.
As the frequency of the voltage source increases, the impedance of
the capacitor decreases relative to the impedance of the resistor, and the
source voltage is now divided between the capacitor and the resistor. The
output voltage magnitude thus begins to increase.
When the frequency of the source is infinite (
), the capacitor
behaves as a short circuit, and thus there is no voltage across the capacitor.
This is illustrated in the equivalent circuit in Fig. 14.10(c). In this circuit,
the input voltage and output voltage are the same.
The phase angle difference between the source and output voltages
also varies as the frequency of the source changes. For 
the output
voltage is the same as the input voltage, so the phase angle difference is
zero. As the frequency of the source decreases and the impedance of the
capacitor increases, a phase shift is introduced between the voltage and
the current in the capacitor. This creates a phase difference between the
source and output voltages. The phase angle of the output voltage leads
that of the source voltage. When 
this phase angle difference
reaches its maximum of +90.

14.3
High-Pass Filters
531
Based on our qualitative analysis, we see that when the output is
defined as the voltage across the resistor, the series RC circuit behaves as
a high-pass filter. The components and connections are identical to the
low-pass series RC circuit, but the choice of output is different. Thus, we
have confirmed the earlier observation that the filtering characteristics of
a circuit depend on the definition of the output as well as on circuit com-
ponents, values, and connections.
Figure 14.11 shows the frequency response plot for the series RC
high-pass filter. For reference, the dashed lines indicate the magnitude
plot for an ideal high-pass filter.We now turn to a quantitative analysis of
this same circuit.
The Series RC Circuit—Quantitative Analysis
To begin, we construct the s-domain equivalent of the circuit in
Fig. 14.10(a). This equivalent is shown in Fig. 14.12. Applying s-domain
voltage division to the circuit, we write the transfer function:
Making the substitution 
results in
(14.15)
Next, we separate Eq. 14.15 into two equations. The first is the equation
describing the magnitude of the transfer function; the second is the equa-
tion describing the phase angle of the transfer function:
(14.16)
(14.17)
A close look at Eqs. 14.16 and 14.17 confirms the shape of the frequency
response plot in Fig. 14.11. Using Eq. 14.16, we can calculate the cutoff fre-
quency for the series RC high-pass filter. Recall that at the cutoff frequency,
the magnitude of the transfer function is

as seen from Fig. 14.11. We can construct
an equation for 
by setting the left-hand side of Eq. 14.16 to
noting that for this series RC circuit,
:
(14.18)
Solving Eq. 14.18 for 
we get
(14.19)
Equation 14.19 presents a familiar result.The cutoff frequency for the
series RC circuit has the value 
whether the circuit is configured as a
low-pass filter in Fig. 14.7 or as a high-pass filter in Fig. 14.10(a). This is
perhaps not a surprising result, as we have already discovered a connec-
tion between the cutoff frequency,
, and the time constant, , of a circuit.
Example 14.3 analyzes a series RL circuit, this time configured as a
high-pass filter. Example 14.4 examines the effect of adding a load resistor
in parallel with the inductor.

Comparing the transfer functions of the unloaded filter in Example 14.3
and the loaded filter in Example 14.4 is useful at this point. Both transfer
functions are in the form:
with 
for the unloaded filter and 
for the loaded
filter. Note that the value of K for the loaded circuit reduces to the value
of K for the unloaded circuit when 
that is, when there is no load
resistor. The cutoff frequencies for both filters can be seen directly from
their transfer functions. In both cases,
where 
for the
unloaded circuit, and 
for the loaded circuit.Again, the
cutoff frequency for the loaded circuit reduces to that of the unloaded cir-
cuit when 
Because 
the effect of the load
resistor is to reduce the passband magnitude by the factor K and to lower
the cutoff frequency by the same factor. We predicted these results at the
beginning of this chapter.The largest output amplitude a passive high-pass
filter can achieve is 1, and placing a load across the filter, as we did in
Example 14.4, has served to decrease the amplitude. When we need to
amplify signals in the passband, we must turn to active filters, such as those
discussed in Chapter 15.
The effect of a load on a filter’s transfer function poses another
dilemma in circuit design.We typically begin with a transfer function spec-
ification and then design a filter to produce that function.We may or may
not know what the load on the filter will be, but in any event, we usually
want the filter’s transfer function to remain the same regardless of the
load on it. This desired behavior cannot be achieved with the passive fil-
ters presented in this chapter.

Introduction to Frequency Selective Circuits
Transfer function for a high-pass filter 
Figure 14.18 summarizes the high-pass filter circuits we have exam-
ined. Look carefully at the expressions for H(s). Notice how similar in form
these expressions are—they differ only in the denominator, which includes
the cutoff frequency. As we did with the low-pass filters in Eq. 14.13, we
state a general form for the transfer function of these two high-pass filters:
(14.20)
Any circuit with the transfer function in Eq. 14.20 would behave as a high-
pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 
The problems at the end of the
chapter give you other examples of circuits with this voltage ratio.
We have drawn attention to another important relationship. We have
discovered that a series RC circuit has the same cutoff frequency whether
it is configured as a low-pass filter or as a high-pass filter.The same is true
of a series RL circuit. Having previously noted the connection between
the cutoff frequency of a filter circuit and the time constant of that same
circuit, we should expect the cutoff frequency to be a characteristic param-
eter of the circuit whose value depends only on the circuit components,
their values, and the way they are connected.

14.4 Bandpass Filters
The next filters we examine are those that pass voltages within a band of
frequencies to the output while filtering out voltages at frequencies out-
side this band.These filters are somewhat more complicated than the low-
pass and high-pass filters of the previous sections.As we have already seen
in Fig. 14.3(c), ideal bandpass filters have two cutoff frequencies,
and
which identify the passband. For realistic bandpass filters, these cutoff
frequencies are again defined as the frequencies for which the magnitude
of the transfer function equals 
Center Frequency, Bandwidth, and Quality Factor
There are three other important parameters that characterize a bandpass
filter. The first is the center frequency,
defined as the frequency for
which a circuit’s transfer function is purely real.Another name for the center

frequency is the resonant frequency.This is the same name given to the fre-
quency that characterizes the natural response of the second-order circuits
in Chapter 8, because they are the same frequencies! When a circuit is
driven at the resonant frequency, we say that the circuit is in resonance,
because the frequency of the forcing function is the same as the natural fre-
quency of the circuit. The center frequency is the geometric center of the
passband, that is,
For bandpass filters, the magnitude of the
transfer function is a maximum at the center frequency (
).
The second parameter is the bandwidth,
,which is the width of the pass-
band.The final parameter is the quality factor, which is the ratio of the center
frequency to the bandwidth.The quality factor gives a measure of the width of
the passband, independent of its location on the frequency axis. It also
describes the shape of the magnitude plot, independent of frequency.
Although there are five different parameters that characterize the
bandpass filter—
and Q—only two of the five can be speci-
fied independently. In other words, once we are able to solve for any two
of these parameters, the other three can be calculated from the dependent
relationships among them. We will define these quantities more specifi-
cally once we have analyzed a bandpass filter. In the next section, we
examine two RLC circuits which act as bandpass filters, and then we
derive expressions for all of their characteristic parameters.
The Series RLC Circuit—Qualitative Analysis
Figure 14.19(a) depicts a series RLC circuit. We want to consider the
effect of changing the source frequency on the magnitude of the output
voltage. As before, changes to the source frequency result in changes to
the impedance of the capacitor and the inductor.This time, the qualitative
analysis is somewhat more complicated, because the circuit has both an
inductor and a capacitor.
At 
the capacitor behaves like an open circuit, and the inductor
behaves like a short circuit.The equivalent circuit is shown in Fig. 14.19(b).
The open circuit representing the impedance of the capacitor prevents cur-
rent from reaching the resistor, and the resulting output voltage is zero.
At 
the capacitor behaves like a short circuit, and the induc-
tor behaves like an open circuit. The equivalent circuit is shown in
Fig. 14.19(c). The inductor now prevents current from reaching the resis-
tor, and again the output voltage is zero.
But what happens in the frequency region between 
and 
? Between these two extremes, both the capacitor and the inductor
have finite impedances. In this region, voltage supplied by the source will
drop across both the inductor and the capacitor, but some voltage will
reach the resistor. Remember that the impedance of the capacitor is nega-
tive, whereas the impedance of the inductor is positive. Thus, at some fre-
quency, the impedance of the capacitor and the impedance of the inductor
have equal magnitudes and opposite signs; the two impedances cancel out,
causing the output voltage to equal the source voltage. This special fre-
quency is the center frequency,
On either side of 
the output voltage
is less than the source voltage. Note that at 
the series combination of
the inductor and capacitor appears as a short circuit.
The plot of the voltage magnitude ratio is shown in Fig. 14.20. Note
that the ideal bandpass filter magnitude plot is overlaid on the plot of the
series RLC transfer function magnitude.
Now consider what happens to the phase angle of the output voltage.
At the frequency where the source and output voltage are the same, the
phase angles are the same. As the frequency decreases, the phase angle
contribution from the capacitor is larger than that from the inductor.

Introduction to Frequency Selective Circuits
Because the capacitor contributes positive phase shift, the net phase angle
at the output is positive. At very low frequencies, the phase angle at the
output maximizes at 
Conversely, if the frequency increases from the frequency at which the
source and the output voltage are in phase, the phase angle contribution
from the inductor is larger than that from the capacitor.The inductor con-
tributes negative phase shift, so the net phase angle at the output is nega-
tive. At very high frequencies, the phase angle at the output reaches its
negative maximum of 
The plot of the phase angle difference thus
has the shape shown in Fig. 14.20.
The Series RLC Circuit—Quantitative Analysis
We begin by drawing the s-domain equivalent for the series RLC circuit,
as shown in Fig. 14.21. Use s-domain voltage division to write an equation
for the transfer function:
(14.21)
As before, we substitute 
into Eq. 14.21 and produce the equations
for the magnitude and the phase angle of the transfer function:
(14.22)
(14.23)
We now calculate the five parameters that characterize this RLC band-
pass filter. Recall that the center frequency,
is defined as the frequency
for which the circuit’s transfer function is purely real. The transfer func-
tion for the RLC circuit in Fig. 14.19(a) will be real when the frequency of
the voltage source makes the sum of the capacitor and inductor imped-
ances zero:
(14.24)
Solving Eq. 14.24 for 
we get
(14.25)
Next,calculate the cutoff frequencies,
and 
Remember that at the
cutoff frequencies, the magnitude of the transfer function is 
Because 
we can calculate 
by substituting Eq. 14.25

Now set the left-hand side of Eq. 14.22 to 
(which equals
) and prepare to solve for 
:
(14.26)
We can equate the denominators of the two sides of Eq. 14.26 to get
(14.27)
Rearranging Eq. 14.27 results in the following quadratic equation:
(14.28)
The solution of Eq. 14.28 yields four values for the cutoff frequency. Only
two of these values are positive and have physical significance; they iden-
tify the passband of this filter:
(14.29)

Introduction to Frequency Selective Circuits
The quality factor, the last of the five characteristic parameters, is defined
as the ratio of center frequency to bandwidth. Using Eqs. 14.25 and 14.32:
(14.33)
We now have five parameters that characterize the series RLC band-
pass filter: two cutoff frequencies,
and 
which delimit the passband;
the center frequency,
at which the magnitude of the transfer function is
maximum; the bandwidth,
a measure of the width of the passband; and
the quality factor, Q, a second measure of passband width. As previously
noted, only two of these parameters can be specified independently in a
design. We have already observed that the quality factor is specified in
terms of the center frequency and the bandwidth. We can also rewrite the
equations for the cutoff frequencies in terms of the center frequency and
the bandwidth:
(14.34)
(14.35)
Alternative forms for these equations express the cutoff frequencies in
terms of the quality factor and the center frequency:
(14.36)
(14.37)
Also see Problem 14.24 at the end of the chapter.
The examples that follow illustrate the design of bandpass filters,
introduce another RLC circuit that behaves as a bandpass filter, and
examine the effects of source resistance on the characteristic parameters
of a series RLC bandpass filter.

Example 14.5
Designing a Bandpass Filter
A graphic equalizer is an audio amplifier that
allows you to select different levels of amplification
within different frequency regions. Using the series
RLC circuit in Fig. 14.19(a), choose values for R, L,
and C that yield a bandpass circuit able to select
inputs within the 1–10 kHz frequency band. Such a
circuit might be used in a graphic equalizer to select
this frequency band from the larger audio band
(generally 0–20 kHz) prior to amplification.
Solution
We need to compute values for R, L, and C that pro-
duce a bandpass filter with cutoff frequencies of 
1 kHz and 10 kHz. There are many possible
approaches to a solution. For instance, we could use
Eqs. 14.29 and 14.30, which specify 
and 
in
terms of R, L, and C. Because of the form of these
equations, the algebraic manipulations might get

complicated. Instead, we will use the fact that the
center frequency is the geometric mean of the cutoff
frequencies to compute 
and we will then use
Eq. 14.31 to compute L and C from 
Next we will
use the definition of quality factor to compute Q,
and last we will use Eq. 14.33 to compute R. Even
though this approach involves more individual com-
putational steps, each calculation is fairly simple.
Any approach we choose will provide only two
equations—insufficient to solve for the three
unknowns—because of the dependencies among the
bandpass filter characteristics.Thus, we need to select
a value for either R,L,or C and use the two equations
we’ve chosen to calculate the remaining component
values. Here, we choose 
as the capacitor value,
because there are stricter limitations on commercially
available capacitors than on inductors or resistors.
We compute the center frequency as the geo-
metric mean of the cutoff frequencies:
Next, compute the value of L using the com-
puted center frequency and the selected value for C.
We must remember to convert the center frequency
to radians per second before we can use Eq. 14.31:

The quality factor, Q, is defined as the ratio of
the center frequency to the bandwidth. The band-
width is the difference between the two cutoff fre-
quency values.Thus,
Now use Eq. 14.33 to calculate R:
To check whether these component values pro-
duce the bandpass filter we want, substitute them
into Eqs. 14.29 and 14.30.We find that
which are the cutoff frequencies specified for 
the filter.
This example reminds us that only two of the
five bandpass filter parameters can be specified
independently. The other three parameters can
always be computed from the two that are speci-
fied. In turn, these five parameter values depend on
the three component values, R, L, and C, of which
only two can be specified independently.

Determining Effect of a Nonideal Voltage Source on a RLC Bandpass Filter
For each of the bandpass filters we have constructed,
we have always assumed an ideal voltage source, that
is, a voltage source with no series resistance. Even
though this assumption is often valid, sometimes it is
not, as in the case where the filter design can be
achieved only with values of R,L,and C whose equiv-
alent impedance has a magnitude close to the actual
impedance of the voltage source. Examine the effect

Figure 14.27  Two RLC bandpass filters, together with
equations for the transfer function, center frequency,
and bandwidth of each.
If we compare the characteristic parameter values for the filter with
to the values for the filter with 
we see the following:
•
The center frequencies are the same.
•
The maximum transfer function magnitude for the filter with 
is smaller than for the filter with 
•
The bandwidth for the filter with 
is larger than that for the fil-
ter with 
Thus, the cutoff frequencies and the quality factors
for the two circuits are also different.
The addition of a nonzero source resistance to a series RLC bandpass fil-
ter leaves the center frequency unchanged but widens the passband and
reduces the passband magnitude.
Here we see the same design challenge we saw with the addition of a
load resistor to the high-pass filter, that is, we would like to design a band-
pass filter that will have the same filtering properties regardless of any
internal resistance associated with the voltage source. Unfortunately, fil-
ters constructed from passive elements have their filtering action altered
with the addition of source resistance. In Chapter 15, we will discover that
active filters are insensitive to changes in source resistance and thus are
better suited to designs in which this is an important issue.
Figure 14.27 summarizes the two RLC bandpass filters we have stud-
ied. Note that the expressions for the circuit transfer functions have the
same form. As we have done previously, we can create a general form for
the transfer functions of these two bandpass filters:
(14.38)
Any circuit with the transfer function in Eq. 14.38 acts as a bandpass filter
with a center frequency 
and a bandwidth 
In Example 14.7, we saw that the transfer function can also be written
in the form
(14.39)
where the values for K and 
depend on whether the series resistance of
the voltage source is zero or nonzero.

Relating the Frequency Domain to the Time Domain
We can identify a relationship between the parameters that characterize the
frequency response of RLC bandpass filters and the parameters that char-
acterize the time response of RLC circuits. Consider the series RLC circuit
in Fig. 14.19(a). In Chapter 8 we discovered that the natural response of this
circuit is characterized by the neper frequency ( ) and the resonant fre-
quency (
). These parameters were expressed in terms of the circuit com-
ponents in Eqs. 8.58 and 8.59, which are repeated here for convenience:
(14.40)
(14.41)
We see that the same parameter 
is used to characterize both the time
response and the frequency response. That’s why the center frequency is
also called the resonant frequency. The bandwidth and the neper fre-
quency are related by the equation
(14.42)
Recall that the natural response of a series RLC circuit may be under-
damped,overdamped,or critically damped.The transition from overdamped
to underdamped occurs when 
Consider the relationship between 
and 
from Eq. 14.42 and the definition of the quality factor Q. The transi-
tion from an overdamped to an underdamped response occurs when
Thus, a circuit whose frequency response contains a sharp peak at
indicating a high Q and a narrow bandwidth, will have an underdamped
natural response.Conversely,a circuit whose frequency response has a broad
bandwidth and a low Q will have an overdamped natural response.

This filter passes source voltages outside the band between the two cutoff
frequencies to the output (the passband), and attenuates source voltages

before they reach the output at frequencies between the two cutoff fre-
quencies (the stopband). Bandpass filters and bandreject filters thus per-
form complementary functions in the frequency domain.
Bandreject filters are characterized by the same parameters as band-
pass filters: the two cutoff frequencies, the center frequency, the band-
width, and the quality factor.Again, only two of these five parameters can
be specified independently.
In the next sections, we examine two circuits that function as band-
reject filters and then compute equations that relate the circuit compo-
nent values to the characteristic parameters for each circuit.
The Series RLC Circuit—Qualitative Analysis
Figure 14.28(a) shows a series RLC circuit.Although the circuit components
and connections are identical to those in the series RLC bandpass filter in
Fig. 14.19(a), the circuit in Fig. 14.28(a) has an important difference: the out-
put voltage is now defined across the inductor-capacitor pair. As we saw in
the case of low- and high-pass filters, the same circuit may perform two dif-
ferent filtering functions, depending on the definition of the output voltage.
We have already noted that at 
the inductor behaves like a
short circuit and the capacitor behaves like an open circuit, but at
these roles switch. Figure 14.28(b) presents the equivalent cir-
cuit for 
Fig. 14.28(c) presents the equivalent circuit for 
In
both equivalent circuits, the output voltage is defined over an effective
open circuit, and thus the output and input voltages have the same mag-
nitude. This series RLC bandreject filter circuit then has two pass-
bands—one below a lower cutoff frequency, and the other above an
upper cutoff frequency.
Between these two passbands, both the inductor and the capacitor
have finite impedances of opposite signs. As the frequency is increased
from zero, the impedance of the inductor increases and that of the capac-
itor decreases. Therefore the phase shift between the input and the out-
put approaches 
as 
approaches 
As soon as 
exceeds
the phase shift jumps to 
and then approaches zero as 
con-
tinues to increase.
At some frequency between the two passbands, the impedances of the
inductor and capacitor are equal but of opposite sign. At this frequency,
the series combination of the inductor and capacitor is that of a short cir-
cuit, so the magnitude of the output voltage must be zero. This is the cen-
ter frequency of this series RLC bandreject filter.
Figure 14.29 presents a sketch of the frequency response of the series
RLC bandreject filter from Fig. 14.28(a). Note that the magnitude plot is
overlaid with that of the ideal bandreject filter from Fig. 14.3(d). Our qual-
itative analysis has confirmed the shape of the magnitude and phase angle
plots. We now turn to a quantitative analysis of the circuit to confirm this
frequency response and to compute values for the parameters that charac-
terize this response.
The Series RLC Circuit—Quantitative Analysis
After transforming to the s-domain, as shown in Fig. 14.30, we use voltage
division to construct an equation for the transfer function:

Substitute 
for s in Eq. 14.43 and generate equations for the transfer
function magnitude and the phase angle:
(14.44)
(14.45)
Note that Eqs. 14.44 and 14.45 confirm the frequency response shape
pictured in Fig. 14.29, which we developed based on the qualita-
tive analysis.
We use the circuit in Fig. 14.30 to calculate the center frequency. For
the bandreject filter, the center frequency is still defined as the frequency
for which the sum of the impedances of the capacitor and inductor is zero.
In the bandpass filter, the magnitude at the center frequency was a maxi-
mum, but in the bandreject filter, this magnitude is a minimum. This is
because in the bandreject filter, the center frequency is not in the pass-
band; rather, it is in the stopband. It is easy to show that the center fre-
quency is given by
(14.46)
Substituting Eq. 14.46 into Eq. 14.44 shows that 
The cutoff frequencies, the bandwidth, and the quality factor are
defined for the bandreject filter in exactly the way they were for the
bandpass filters. Compute the cutoff frequencies by substituting the
constant 
for the left-hand side of Eq. 14.44 and then solv-

in terms of the bandwidth and center frequency, as we did for the band-

bandreject filter is a parallel RLC circuit. Whereas the analysis details of
the parallel RLC circuit are left to Problem 14.37, the results are summa-

Introduction to Frequency Selective Circuits
Practical Perspective
Pushbutton Telephone Circuits
In the Practical Perspective at the start of this chapter, we described the
dual-tone-multiple-frequency (DTMF) system used to signal that a button
has been pushed on a pushbutton telephone. A key element of the DTMF
system is the DTMF receiver—a circuit that decodes the tones produced by
pushing a button and determines which button was pushed.
In order to design a DTMF reciever, we need a better understanding of
the DTMF system. As you can see from Fig. 14.32, the buttons on the tele-
phone are organized into rows and columns. The pair of tones generated by
pushing a button depends on the button’s row and column. The button’s row
determines its low-frequency tone, and the button’s column determines its
high-frequency tone.1 For example, pressing the “6” button produces sinu-
soidal tones with the frequencies 
and 
.
At the telephone switching facility, bandpass filters in the DTMF receiver
first detect whether tones from both the low-frequency and high-frequency
groups are simultaneously present. This test rejects many extraneous audio
signals that are not DTMF. If tones are present in both bands, other filters are
used to select among the possible tones in each band so that the frequencies
can be decoded into a unique button signal. Additional tests are performed to
prevent false button detection. For example, only one tone per frequency
band is allowed; the high- and low-band frequencies must start and stop
within a few milliseconds of one another to be considered valid; and the high-
and low-band signal amplitudes must be sufficiently close to each other.
You may wonder why bandpass filters are used instead of a high-pass
filter for the high-frequency group of DTMF tones and a low-pass filter for
the low-frequency group of DTMF tones. The reason is that the telephone
system uses frequencies outside of the 
–
band for other signal-
ing purposes, such as ringing the phone’s bell. Bandpass filters prevent
the DTMF receiver from erroneously detecting these other signals.
NOTE: Assess your understanding of this Practical Perspective by trying

A frequency selective circuit, or filter, enables signals at
certain frequencies to reach the output, and it attenu-
ates signals at other frequencies to prevent them from
reaching the output. The passband contains the fre-
quencies of those signals that are passed; the stopband
contains the frequencies of those signals that are atten-
uated. (See page 522.)

Up to this point, we have considered only passive filter circuits,
that is, filter circuits consisting of resistors, inductors, and capaci-
tors. There are areas of application, however, where active cir-
cuits, those that employ op amps, have certain advantages over
passive filters. For instance, active circuits can produce bandpass
and bandreject filters without using inductors. This is desirable
because inductors are usually large, heavy, costly, and they may
introduce electromagnetic field effects that compromise the
desired frequency response characteristics.
Examine the transfer functions of all the filter circuits from
Chapter 14 and you will notice that the maximum magnitude
does not exceed 1. Even though passive resonant filters can
achieve voltage and current amplification at the resonant fre-
quency, passive filters in general are incapable of amplification,
because the output magnitude does not exceed the input magni-
tude. This is not a surprising observation, as many of the transfer
functions in Chapter 14 were derived using voltage or current
division. Active filters provide a control over amplification not
available in passive filter circuits.
Finally, recall that both the cutoff frequency and the pass-
band magnitude of passive filters were altered with the addition
of a resistive load at the output of the filter. This is not the case
with active filters, due to the properties of op amps. Thus, we use
active circuits to implement filter designs when gain, load varia-
tion, and physical size are important parameters in the design
specifications.
In this chapter, we examine a few of the many filter circuits
that employ op amps. As you will see, these op amp circuits over-
come the disadvantages of passive filter circuits. Also, we will
show how the basic op amp filter circuits can be combined to
achieve specific frequency responses and to attain a more nearly
ideal filter response. Note that throughout this chapter we
assume that every op amp behaves as an ideal op amp.

CHAPTER

In this chapter, we continue to examine circuits that are fre-
quency selective. As described in Chapter 14, this means that
the behavior of the circuit depends on the frequency of its
sinusoidal input. Most of the circuits presented here fall into
one of the four categories identified in Chapter 14—low-pass
filters, high-pass filters, bandpass filters, and bandreject fil-
ters. But whereas the circuits in Chapter 14 were constructed
using sources, resistors, capacitors, and inductors, the cir-
cuits in this chapter employ op amps. We shall soon see what
advantages are conferred to a filter circuit constructed using
op amps.
Audio electronic systems such as radios, tape players, and
CD players often provide separate volume controls labeled
“treble” and “bass.” These controls permit the user to select
the volume of high frequency audio signals (“treble”) inde-
pendent of the volume of low frequency audio signals
(“bass”). The ability to independently adjust the amount of
amplification (boost) or attenuation (cut) in these two fre-
quency bands allows a listener to customize the sound with
more precision than would be provided with a single volume

referred to as a tone control circuit.
The Practical Perspective example at the end of this
chapter presents a circuit that implements bass volume con-
trol using a single op amp together with resistors and capaci-
tors. An adjustable resistor supplies the necessary control
over the amplification in the bass frequency range.

Active Filter Circuits
15.1 First-Order Low-Pass 
and High-Pass Filters
Consider the circuit in Fig. 15.1. Qualitatively, when the frequency of the
source is varied, only the impedance of the capacitor is affected. At very
low frequencies, the capacitor acts like an open circuit, and the op amp cir-
cuit acts like an amplifier with a gain of 
At very high frequencies,
the capacitor acts like a short circuit, thereby connecting the output of the
op amp circuit to ground. The op amp circuit in Fig. 15.1 thus functions as
a low-pass filter with a passband gain of 
To confirm this qualitative assessment, we can compute the transfer
function 
Note that the circuit in Fig. 15.1 has the gen-
eral form of the circuit shown in Fig. 15.2, where the impedance in the
input path 
is the resistor 
and the impedance in the feedback path
is the parallel combination of the resistor 
and the capacitor C.
The circuit in Fig. 15.2 is analogous to the inverting amplifier circuit
from Chapter 5, so its transfer function is 
Therefore, the transfer
function for the circuit in Fig. 15.1 is

where

and
(15.3)
Note that Eq.15.1 has the same form as the general equation for low-pass fil-
ters given in Chapter 14, with an important exception: The gain in the pass-
band,K,is set by the ratio 
The op amp low-pass filter thus permits the
passband gain and the cutoff frequency to be specified independently.
A Note About Frequency Response Plots
Frequency response plots, introduced in Chapter 14, provide valuable
insight into the way a filter circuit functions. Thus we make extensive
use of frequency response plots in this chapter, too. The frequency
response plots in Chapter 14 comprised two separate plots—a plot of
the transfer function magnitude versus frequency, and a plot of the
transfer function phase angle, in degrees, versus frequency. When we
use both plots, they are normally stacked on top of one another so that
they can share the same frequency axis.
In this chapter, we use a special type of frequency response plots
called Bode plots. Bode plots are discussed in detail in Appendix E, which
includes detailed information about how to construct these plots by hand.
You will probably use a computer to construct Bode plots, so here we

summarize the special features of these plots. Bode plots differ from the
frequency response plots in Chapter 14 in two important ways.
First, instead of using a linear axis for the frequency values, a Bode
plot uses a logarithmic axis. This permits us to plot a wider range of fre-
quencies of interest. Normally we plot three or four decades of frequen-
cies, say from 
to 
, or 1 kHz to 1 MHz, choosing the
frequency range where the transfer function characteristics are changing.
If we plot both the magnitude and phase angle plots, they again share the
frequency axis.
Second, instead of plotting the absolute magnitude of the transfer
function versus frequency, the Bode magnitude is plotted in decibels (dB)
versus the log of the frequency. The decibel is discussed in Appendix D.
Briefly, if the magnitude of the transfer function is 
, its value in dB
is given by
.
It is important to remember that while

is a signed quantity. When 
the transfer function magnitude
is 1, since 
When 
the transfer function magni-
tude is between 0 and 1, and when 
the transfer function magni-
tude is greater than 1. Finally, note that
.
Recall that we define the cutoff frequency of filters by determining
the frequency at which the maximum magnitude of the transfer function
has been reduced by 
If we translate this definition to magnitude in
dB, we define the cutoff frequency of a filter by determining the frequency
at which the maximum magnitude of the transfer function in dB has been
reduced by 3 dB. For example, if the magnitude of a low-pass filter in its
passband is 26 dB, the magnitude used to find the cutoff frequency is

meet desired specifications of passband gain and cutoff frequency, and

You may have recognized the circuit in Fig. 15.1 as the integrating
amplifier circuit introduced in Chapter 7. They are indeed the same cir-
cuit, so integration in the time domain corresponds to low-pass filtering in
the frequency domain.This relationship between integration and low-pass
filtering is further confirmed by the operational Laplace transform for
integration derived in Chapter 12.
The circuit in Fig. 15.4 is a first-order high-pass filter. This circuit also

Again, the form of the transfer function given in Eq. 15.4 is the same as that
given in Eq. 14.20, the equation for passive high-pass filters.And again, the
active filter permits the design of a passband gain greater than 1.
Example 15.2 considers the design of an active high-pass filter which
must meet frequency response specifications from a Bode plot.
Example 15.2
Designing a High-Pass Op Amp Filter
Figure 15.5 shows the Bode magnitude plot of a
high-pass filter. Using the active high-pass filter cir-
cuit in Fig. 15.4, calculate values of 
and 
that
produce the desired magnitude response. Use a
capacitor. If a 
load resistor is added to
this filter, how will the magnitude response change?
Solution
Begin by writing a transfer function that has the
magnitude plot shown in Fig. 15.5. To do this, note
that the gain in the passband is 20 dB; therefore,
Also note that the 3 dB point is 
Equation 15.4 is the transfer function for a high-
pass filter, so the transfer function that has the mag-
nitude response shown in Fig. 15.5 is given by
We can compute the values of 
and 
needed to
yield this transfer function by equating the transfer
function with Eq. 15.4:
Equating the numerators and denominators and
then simplifying, we get two equations:
Using the specified value of C (
), we find
The circuit is shown in Fig. 15.6.
Because we have made the assumption that
the op amp in this high-pass filter circuit is ideal,
the addition of any load resistor, regardless of its
resistance, has no effect on the behavior of the op
amp. Thus, the magnitude response of a high-pass
filter with a load resistor is the same as that of a
high-pass filter with no load resistor, which is
depicted in Fig. 15.5.

Active Filter Circuits
15.2 Scaling
In the design and analysis of both passive and active filter circuits, working
with element values such as 
1 H, and 1 F is convenient. Although
these values are unrealistic for specifying practical components, they
greatly simplify computations. After making computations using conven-
ient values of R, L, and C, the designer can transform the convenient val-
ues into realistic values using the process known as scaling.
There are two types of scaling: magnitude and frequency. We scale a
circuit in magnitude by multiplying the impedance at a given frequency by
the scale factor 
Thus we multiply all resistors and inductors by 
and
all capacitors by 
If we let unprimed variables represent the initial
values of the parameters, and we let primed variables represent the scaled
values of the variables, we have

Note that 
is by definition a positive real number that can be either less
than or greater than 1.
In frequency scaling, we change the circuit parameters so that at the
new frequency, the impedance of each element is the same as it was at the
original frequency. Because resistance values are assumed to be independ-
ent of frequency, resistors are unaffected by frequency scaling. If we let 
denote the frequency scale factor, both inductors and capacitors are multi-
plied by 
Thus for frequency scaling,

The frequency scale factor 
is also a positive real number that can be less
than or greater than unity.
A circuit can be scaled simultaneously in both magnitude and frequency.

The Use of Scaling in the Design of Op Amp Filters
To use the concept of scaling in the design of op amp filters, first select
the cutoff frequency,
to be 
(if you are designing low- or high-
pass filters), or select the center frequency,
to be 
(if you are
designing bandpass or bandreject filters).Then select a 1 F capacitor and
calculate the values of the resistors needed to give the desired passband
gain and the 
cutoff or center frequency. Finally, use scaling to
compute more realistic component values that give the desired cutoff or
center frequency.
Example 15.3

process in general, and

15.3 Op Amp Bandpass 
and Bandreject Filters
We now turn to the analysis and design of op amp circuits that act as band-
pass and bandreject filters. While there is a wide variety of such op amp
circuits, our initial approach is motivated by the Bode plot construction
shown in Fig. 15.9. We can see from the plot that the bandpass filter con-
sists of three separate components:
1. A unity-gain low-pass filter whose cutoff frequency is 
the larger
of the two cutoff frequencies;
2. A unity-gain high-pass filter whose cutoff frequency is 
the
smaller of the two cutoff frequencies; and
3. A gain component to provide the desired level of gain in
the passband.

Finally, we need to meet the passband gain
specification. We can adjust the scaled values of
either

If we adjust
we will change the cutoff frequency, because
Therefore, we can adjust the value of
to alter only the passband gain:

Op Amp Bandpass and Bandreject Filters
565
These three components are cascaded in series. They combine additively
in the Bode plot construction and so will combine multiplicatively in the 
s domain. It is important to note that this method of constructing a band-
pass magnitude response assumes that the lower cutoff frequency (
) is
smaller than the upper cutoff frequency (
).The resulting filter is called
a broadband bandpass filter, because the band of frequencies passed is
wide. The formal definition of a broadband filter requires the two cutoff
frequencies to satisfy the equation
As illustrated by the Bode plot construction in Fig. 15.9, we require the
magnitude of the high-pass filter be unity at the cutoff frequency of the
low-pass filter and the magnitude of the low-pass filter be unity at the cut-
off frequency of the high-pass filter.Then the bandpass filter will have the
cutoff frequencies specified by the low-pass and high-pass filters.We need
to determine the relationship between 
and 
that will satisfy the
requirements illustrated in Fig. 15.9.
We can construct a circuit that provides each of the three compo-
nents by cascading a low-pass op amp filter, a high-pass op amp filter,
and an inverting amplifier (see Section 5.3), as shown in Fig. 15.10(a).
Figure 15.10(a) is a form of illustration called a block diagram. Each
block represents a component or subcircuit, and the output of one
block is the input to the next, in the direction indicated. We wish to
establish the relationship between 
and 
that will permit each sub-
circuit to be designed independently, without concern for the other sub-
circuits in the cascade. Then the design of the bandpass filter is reduced
to the design of a unity-gain first-order low-pass filter, a unity-gain first-
order high-pass filter, and an inverting amplifier, each of which is a sim-
ple circuit.

We can use a component approach to the design of op amp bandreject
filters too, as illustrated in Fig. 15.12. Like the bandpass filter, the band-
reject filter consists of three separate components. There are important
differences, however:
1. The unity-gain low-pass filter has a cutoff frequency of 
which is
the smaller of the two cutoff frequencies.
2. The unity-gain high-pass filter has a cutoff frequency of 
which
is the larger of the two cutoff frequencies.
3. The gain component provides the desired level of gain in
the passbands.

The most important difference is that these three components cannot
be cascaded in series, because they do not combine additively on the Bode
plot. Instead, we use a parallel connection and a summing amplifier, as
shown both in block diagram form and as a circuit in Fig. 15.13.Again, it is
assumed that the two cutoff frequencies are widely separated, so that the
resulting design is a broadband bandreject filter, and 
Then
each component of the parallel design can be created independently, and
the cutoff frequency specifications will be satisfied. The transfer function
of the resulting circuit is the sum of the low-pass and high-pass filter trans-
fer functions. From Fig. 15.13(b),

As with the design of the cascaded bandpass filter, we have six unknowns
and three equations.Typically we choose a commercially available capacitor

tude at the center frequency is much smaller than the passband magnitude.
Thus the bandreject filter successfully rejects frequencies near the center
frequency, again confirming our assumption that the parallel implementa-
tion is meant for broadband bandreject designs.

Solution
From the Bode magnitude plot in Fig. 15.14, we see
that the bandreject filter has cutoff frequencies of

15.4 Higher Order Op Amp Filters
You have probably noticed that all of the filter circuits we have exam-
ined so far, both passive and active, are nonideal. Remember from
Chapter 14 that an ideal filter has a discontinuity at the point of cutoff,
which sharply divides the passband and the stopband. Although we can-
not hope to construct a circuit with a discontinuous frequency response,
we can construct circuits with a sharper, yet still continuous, transition at
the cutoff frequency.

Cascading Identical Filters
How can we obtain a sharper transition between the passband and the
stopband? One approach is suggested by the Bode magnitude plots in
Fig. 15.16. This figure shows the Bode magnitude plots of a cascade of
identical prototype low-pass filters and includes plots of just one filter, two
in cascade, three in cascade, and four in cascade. It is obvious that as more
filters are added to the cascade, the transition from the passband to the
stopband becomes sharper. The rules for constructing Bode plots (from
Appendix E) tell us that with one filter, the transition occurs with an
asymptotic slope of 20 decibels per decade (
). Because circuits in
cascade are additive on a Bode magnitude plot, a cascade with two filters
has a transition with an asymptotic slope of 
; for
three filters, the asymptotic slope is 
and for four filters, it is
as seen in Fig. 15.16.
In general, an n-element cascade of identical low-pass filters will transi-
tion from the passband to the stopband with a slope of 
. Both
the block diagram and the circuit diagram for such a cascade are shown in
Fig. 15.17. It is easy to compute the transfer function for a cascade of n pro-
totype low-pass filters—we just multiply the individual transfer functions:
(15.21)
The order of a filter is determined by the number of poles in its trans-
fer function. From Eq. 15.21, we see that a cascade of first-order low-pass
filters yields a higher order filter. In fact, a cascade of n first-order filters
produces an nth-order filter, having n poles in its transfer function and a
final slope of 
in the transition band.

Higher Order Op Amp Filters

There is an important issue yet to be resolved, as you will see if you
look closely at Fig. 15.16.As the order of the low-pass filter is increased by
adding prototype low-pass filters to the cascade, the cutoff frequency also
changes. For example, in a cascade of two first-order low-pass filters, the
magnitude of the resulting second-order filter at 
is 
, so the cutoff
frequency of the second-order filter is not 
In fact, the cutoff frequency
is less than 
As long as we are able to calculate the cutoff frequency of the higher
order filters formed in the cascade of first-order filters, we can use fre-
quency scaling to calculate component values that move the cutoff fre-
quency to its specified location. If we start with a cascade of n prototype
low-pass filters, we can compute the cutoff frequency for the resulting 
nth-order low-pass filter.We do so by solving for the value of 
that results
in 
:

To demonstrate the use of Eq. 15.22, let’s compute the cutoff fre-
quency of a fourth-order unity-gain low-pass filter constructed from a cas-
cade of four prototype low-pass filters:

Thus, we can design a fourth-order low-pass filter with any arbitrary cutoff
frequency by starting with a fourth-order cascade consisting of prototype
low-pass filters and then scaling the components by 
to
place the cutoff frequency at any value of 
desired.
Note that we can build a higher order low-pass filter with a
nonunity gain by adding an inverting amplifier circuit to the cascade.

Figure 15.19  The Bode magnitude plot for the fourth-order low-pass
filter designed in Example 15.7.
By cascading identical low-pass filters, we can increase the asymptotic
slope in the transition and control the location of the cutoff frequency, but
our approach has a serious shortcoming: The gain of the filter is not con-
stant between zero and the cutoff frequency 
Remember that in an
ideal low-pass filter, the passband magnitude is 1 for all frequencies below
the cutoff frequency. But in Fig. 15.16, we see that the magnitude is less
than 1 (0 dB) for frequencies much less than the cutoff frequency.
This nonideal passband behavior is best understood by looking at the
magnitude of the transfer function for a unity-gain low-pass nth-order cas-
cade. Because
the magnitude is given by
(15.24)
As we can see from Eq. 15.24, when 
the denominator is
approximately 1, and the magnitude of the transfer function is also nearly 1.
But as 
the denominator becomes larger than 1, so the magnitude
becomes smaller than 1. Because the cascade of low-pass filters results in
this nonideal behavior in the passband, other approaches are taken in the
design of higher order filters. One such approach is examined next.

Butterworth Filters
A unity-gain Butterworth low-pass filter has a transfer function whose
magnitude is given by
(15.25)
where n is an integer that denotes the order of the filter.1
When studying Eq. 15.25, note the following:
1. The cutoff frequency is 
for all values of n.
2. If n is large enough, the denominator is always close to unity when

This last observation is important, because an even exponent is required
for a physically realizable circuit (see Problem 15.26).
Given an equation for the magnitude of the transfer function, how do
we find 
? The derivation for 
is greatly simplified by using a proto-
type filter.Therefore, we set

will use scaling to transform the prototype filter to a filter that meets the
given filtering specifications.

a cascade is shown in Fig. 15.20, using a fifth-order Butterworth poly-
nomial as an example.
All odd-order Butterworth polynomials include the factor 
so all odd-order Butterworth filter circuits must have a subcircuit that
provides the transfer function 
This is the transfer
function of the prototype low-pass op amp filter from Fig. 15.1. So what
remains is to find a circuit that provides a transfer function of the form
Such a circuit is shown in Fig. 15.21. The analysis of this circuit begins
by writing the s-domain nodal equations at the noninverting terminal of
the op amp and at the node labeled 
:
(15.29)
(15.30)
Simplifying Eqs. 15.29 and 15.30 yields
(15.31)
(15.32)
Using Cramer’s rule with Eqs. 15.31 and 15.32, we solve for 
:
(15.33)
Then, rearrange Eq. 15.33 to write the transfer function for the circuit in

Finally, set 
in Eq. 15.34; then
(15.35)
Note that Eq. 15.35 has the form required for the second-order circuit
in the Butterworth cascade. In other words, to get a transfer function of
the form
we use the circuit in Fig. 15.21 and choose capacitor values so that
(15.36)
We have thus outlined the procedure for designing an nth-order
Butterworth low-pass filter circuit with a cutoff frequency of 
and a gain of 1 in the passband. We can use frequency scaling to calculate
revised capacitor values that yield any other cutoff frequency, and we can
use magnitude scaling to provide more realistic or practical component
values in our design. We can cascade an inverting amplifier circuit to pro-
vide a gain other than 1 in the passband.

Designing a Fourth-Order Low-Pass Butterworth Filter
Design a fourth-order Butterworth low-pass filter
with a cutoff frequency of 500 Hz and a passband
gain of 10. Use as many 
resistors as possible.
Compare the Bode magnitude plot for this
Butterworth filter with that of the identical cascade
filter in Example 15.7.
Solution
From Table 15.1, we find that the fourth-order
Butterworth polynomial is
We will thus need a cascade of two second-order fil-
ters to yield the fourth-order transfer function plus
an inverting amplifier circuit for the passband gain
of 10.The circuit is shown in Fig. 15.22.
Let the first stage of the cascade implement

function

passband gain of 10 (20 dB) and a cutoff frequency
of 500 Hz, but the Butterworth filter is closer to an
ideal low-pass filter due to its flatter passband and
steeper rolloff at the cutoff frequency. Thus, the
Butterworth design is preferred over the identical
cascade design.

The Order of a Butterworth Filter
It should be apparent at this point that the higher the order of the
Butterworth filter, the closer the magnitude characteristic comes to that of
an ideal low-pass filter. In other words, as n increases, the magnitude stays
close to unity in the passband, the transition band narrows, and the magni-
tude stays close to zero in the stopband. At the same time, as the order
increases, the number of circuit components increases. It follows then that

Higher Order Op Amp Filters

a fundamental problem in the design of a filter is to determine the small-
est value of n that will meet the filtering specifications.
In the design of a low-pass filter, the filtering specifications are usually
given in terms of the abruptness of the transition region, as shown in
Fig. 15.24. Once 
and 
are specified, the order of the
Butterworth filter can be determined.
For the Butterworth filter,
(15.37)
(15.38)
It follows from the definition of the logarithm that
(15.39)
(15.40)
Now we solve for 
and 
and then form the ratio 
We get

where the symbols

have been introduced for convenience.
From Eq. 15.41 we can write
or
(15.42)
We can simplify Eq. 15.42 if 
is the cutoff frequency, because then 
equals 
and 
Hence
(15.43)
One further simplification is possible. We are using a Butterworth fil-
ter to achieve a steep transition region. Therefore, the filtering specifica-
tion will make 
Thus

Therefore, a good approximation for the calculation of n is

Active Filter Circuits
The order of the filter must be an integer; hence, in using either
Eq. 15.42 or Eq. 15.46, we must select the nearest integer value greater
than the result given by the equation. The following examples illustrate
the usefulness of Eqs. 15.42 and 15.46.
Example 15.10
Determining the Order of a Butterworth Filter
a) Determine the order of a Butterworth filter that
has a cutoff frequency of 1000 Hz and a gain of
no more than 
at 6000 Hz.
b) What is the actual gain in dB at 6000 Hz?
Solution
a) Because the cutoff frequency is given, we know
We also note from the specification that
sp = 1.
-50 dB
is much greater than 1. Hence, we can
use Eq. 15.46 with confidence:
Therefore, we need a fourth-order Butterworth
filter.
b) We can use Eq. 15.25 to calculate the actual gain
at 6000 Hz.The gain in decibels will be

 log10(6000>1000) = 3.21.

Example 15.11
An Alternate Approach to Determining the Order of a Butterworth Filter
a) Determine the order of a Butterworth filter
whose magnitude is 10 dB less than the passband
magnitude at 500 Hz and at least 60 dB less than
the passband magnitude at 5000 Hz.
b) Determine the cutoff frequency of the filter 
(in hertz).
c) What is the actual gain of the filter (in decibels)
at 5000 Hz?
Solution
a) Because the cutoff frequency is not given, we use
Eq. 15.42 to determine the order of the filter:
 n =
log10(1000>3)
log10(10)
= 2.52.
 vs>vp = fs>fp = 5000>500 = 10,
 ss = 210-0.1(-60) - 1 L 1000,
 sp = 210-0.1(-10) - 1 = 3,
Therefore we need a third-order Butterworth
filter to meet the specifications.
b) Knowing that the gain at 500 Hz is 
we can
determine the cutoff frequency.From Eq.15.25 we
can write
where 
Therefore
and
It follows that
c) The actual gain of the filter at 5000 Hz is

Butterworth High-Pass, Bandpass, and Bandreject Filters
An nth-order Butterworth high-pass filter has a transfer function with the
nth-order Butterworth polynomial in the denominator,just like the nth-order
Butterworth low-pass filter.But in the high-pass filter,the numerator of the
transfer function is 
whereas in the low-pass filter, the numerator is 1.
Again, we use a cascade approach in designing the Butterworth high-pass
filter. The first-order factor is achieved by including a prototype high-pass
filter (Fig. 15.4, with 
and 
) in the cascade.
To produce the second-order factors in the Butterworth polynomial,
we need a circuit with a transfer function of the form
Such a circuit is shown in Fig. 15.25.
This circuit has the transfer function
(15.47)
Setting 
yields
(15.48)
Thus, we can realize any second-order factor in a Butterworth polynomial
of the form 
by including in the cascade the second-order
circuit in Fig. 15.25 with resistor values that satisfy Eq. 15.49:
(15.49)
At this point, we pause to make a couple of observations relative to
Figs.
15.21
and 
15.25
and 
their 
prototype 
transfer 
functions
and 
These observations are impor-
tant because they are true in general. First, the high-pass circuit in Fig.
15.25 was obtained from the low-pass circuit in Fig. 15.21 by interchanging
resistors and capacitors. Second, the prototype transfer function of a high-
pass filter can be obtained from that of a low-pass filter by replacing s in
the low-pass expression with 
(see Problem 15.46).
We can use frequency and magnitude scaling to design a Butterworth
high-pass filter with practical component values and a cutoff frequency
other than 
Adding an inverting amplifier to the cascade will
accommodate designs with nonunity passband gains. The problems at the
end of the chapter include several Butterworth high-pass filter designs.
Now that we can design both nth-order low-pass and high-pass
Butterworth filters with arbitrary cutoff frequencies and passband gains,
we can combine these filters in cascade (as we did in Section 15.3) to pro-
duce nth-order Butterworth bandpass filters.We can combine these filters
in parallel with a summing amplifier (again, as we did in Section 15.3) to
produce nth-order Butterworth bandreject filters.This chapter’s problems
also include Butterworth bandpass and bandreject filter designs.

15.5 Narrowband Bandpass and
Bandreject Filters
The cascade and parallel component designs for synthesizing bandpass
and bandreject filters from simpler low-pass and high-pass filters have the
restriction that only broadband, or low-Q, filters will result. (The Q, of
course, stands for quality factor.) This limitation is due principally to the
fact that the transfer functions for cascaded bandpass and parallel band-
reject filters have discrete real poles. The synthesis techniques work best
for cutoff frequencies that are widely separated and therefore yield the
lowest quality factors. But the largest quality factor we can achieve with
discrete real poles arises when the cutoff frequencies, and thus the pole
locations, are the same. Consider the transfer function that results:
(15.50)
Eq. 15.50 is in the standard form of the transfer function of a bandpass filter,
and thus we can determine the bandwidth and center frequency directly:
(15.51)
(15.52)
From Eqs. 15.51 and 15.52 and the definition of Q, we see that
(15.53)
Thus with discrete real poles, the highest quality bandpass filter (or band-
reject filter) we can achieve has 
To build active filters with high quality factor values, we need an op
amp circuit that can produce a transfer function with complex conjugate
poles. Figure 15.26 depicts one such circuit for us to analyze.At the invert-
ing input of the op amp, we sum the currents to get

Since Eq. 15.56 is in the standard form of the transfer function for a

Practical Perspective
Bass Volume Control
We now look at an op amp circuit that can be used to control the amplifica-
tion of an audio signal in the bass range. The audio range consists of signals
having frequencies from 
to 
. The bass range includes frequen-
cies up to 300 Hz. The volume control circuit and its frequency response are
shown in Fig. 15.32. The particular response curve in the family of response
curves is selected by adjusting the potentiometer setting in Fig. 15.32(a).
In studying the frequency response curves in Fig. 15.32(b) note the fol-
lowing. First, the gain in dB can be either positive or negative. If the gain
is positive a signal in the bass range is amplified or boosted. If the gain is
negative the signal is attenuated or cut. Second, it is possible to select a

response characteristic that yields unity gain (zero dB) for all frequencies in
the bass range. As we shall see, if the potentiometer is set at its midpoint,
the circuit will have no effect on signals in the bass range. Finally, as the
frequency increases, all the characteristic responses approach zero dB or
unity gain. Hence the volume control circuit will have no effect on signals
in the upper end or treble range of the audio frequencies.
The first step in analyzing the frequency response of the circuit in
Fig. 15.32(a) is to calculate the transfer function 
. To facilitate this
calculation the s-domain equivalent circuit is given in Fig. 15.33. The node
voltages 
and 
have been labeled in the circuit to support node volt-
age analysis. The position of the potentiometer is determined by the numer-
ical value of , as noted in Fig. 15.33.
To find the transfer function we write the three node voltage equations
that describe the circuit and then solve the equations for the voltage ratio
. The node voltage equations are
These three node-voltage equations can be solved to find 
as a function
of 
and hence the transfer function 
:
It follows directly that
Now let’s verify that this transfer function will generate the family of fre-
quency response curves depicted in Fig. 15.32(b). First note that when
the magnitude of 
is unity for all frequencies, i.e.,
|H(jv)| = |R1 + 0.5R2 + jvR1R2C1|

Active Filter Circuits
Summary
•
Active filters consist of op amps, resistors, and capacitors.
They can be configured as low-pass, high-pass, bandpass,
and bandreject filters.They overcome many of the disad-
vantages associated with passive filters. (See page 558.)
•
A prototype low-pass filter has component values of
and 
, and it produces a unity
passband gain and a cutoff frequency of 
The
prototype high-pass filter has the same component val-
ues and also produces a unity passband gain and a cut-
off frequency of 
(See pages 559 and 560.)
•
Magnitude scaling can be used to alter component val-
ues without changing the frequency response of a circuit.
For a magnitude scale factor of km, the scaled (primed)
values of resistance, capacitance, and inductance are
(See page 562.)
•
Frequency scaling can be used to shift the frequency
response of a circuit to another frequency region without
changing the overall shape of the frequency response.
For a frequency scale factor of 
, the scaled (primed)
values of resistance, capacitance, and inductance are
(See page 562.)
•
Components can be scaled in both magnitude and fre-
quency, with the scaled (primed) component values
given by
(See page 562.)
•
The design of active low-pass and high-pass filters can
begin with a prototype filter circuit. Scaling can then be
applied to shift the frequency response to the desired
cutoff frequency, using component values that are com-
mercially available. (See page 563.)
•
An active broadband bandpass filter can be constructed
using a cascade of a low-pass filter with the bandpass fil-
ter’s upper cutoff frequency, a high-pass filter with the
bandpass filter’s lower cutoff frequency, and (optionally)
an inverting amplifier gain stage to achieve nonunity
gain in the passband. Bandpass filters implemented in
this fashion must be broadband filters (
), so
that the elements of the cascade can be specified inde-
pendently of one another. (See page 566.)
•
An active broadband bandreject filter can be con-
structed using a parallel combination of a low-pass filter
with the bandreject filter’s lower cutoff frequency and a

R¿ = kmR, L¿ = (km>kf)L, and C¿ = C>(kmkf).

high-pass filter with the bandreject filter’s upper cutoff
frequency. The outputs are then fed into a summing
amplifier, which can produce nonunity gain in the pass-
band. Bandreject filters implemented in this way must
be broadband filters (
), so that the low-pass
and high-pass filter circuits can be designed independ-
ently of one another. (See page 570.)
•
Higher order active filters have multiple poles in their
transfer functions, resulting in a sharper transition from
the passband to the stopband and thus a more nearly
ideal frequency response. (See page 571.)
•
The transfer function of an nth-order Butterworth low-
pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 
can be
determined from the equation
by
•
finding the roots of the denominator polynomial
•
assigning the left-half plane roots to H(s)
•
writing the denominator of H(s) as a product of first-
and second-order factors
(See page 576–577.)
•
The fundamental problem in the design of a
Butterworth filter is to determine the order of the filter.
The filter specification usually defines the sharpness of
the transition band in terms of the quantities Ap,
p, As,
and 
s. From these quantities, we calculate the smallest
integer larger than the solution to either Eq. 15.42 or
Eq. 15.46. (See page 581.)
•
A cascade of second-order low-pass op amp filters
(Fig. 15.21) with 1 
resistors and capacitor values cho-
sen to produce each factor in the Butterworth poly-
nomial will produce an even-order Butterworth low-pass
filter.Adding a prototype low-pass op amp filter will pro-
duce an odd-order Butterworth low-pass filter. (See
page 579.)
•
A cascade of second-order high-pass op amp filters
(Fig. 15.25) with 1 F capacitors and resistor values cho-
sen to produce each factor in the Butterworth poly-
nomial will produce an even-order Butterworth
high-pass filter. Adding a prototype high-pass op amp
filter will produce an odd-order Butterworth high-pass
filter. (See page 583.)
•
For both high- and low-pass Butterworth filters, fre-
quency and magnitude scaling can be used to shift the
cutoff frequency from 
and to include realistic

component values in the design. Cascading an inverting
amplifier will produce a nonunity passband gain. (See
page 578.)
•
Butterworth low-pass and high-pass filters can be cas-
caded to produce Butterworth bandpass filters of any
order n. Butterworth low-pass and high-pass filters can
be combined in parallel with a summing amplifier to
produce a Butterworth bandreject filter of any order n.
(See page 583.)
•
If a high-Q, or narrowband, bandpass, or bandreject fil-
ter is needed, the cascade or parallel combination will
not work. Instead, the circuits shown in Figs. 15.26 and
15.29 are used with the appropriate design equations.
Typically, capacitor values are chosen from those com-
mercially available, and the design equations are used
to specify the resistor values. (See page 584.)

In the preceding chapters, we devoted a considerable amount
of discussion to steady-state sinusoidal analysis. One reason for
this interest in the sinusoidal excitation function is that it allows
us to find the steady-state response to nonsinusoidal, but peri-
odic, excitations. A periodic function is a function that repeats
itself every T seconds. For example, the triangular wave illus-
trated in Fig. 16.1 on page 604 is a nonsinusoidal, but periodic,
break waveform.
A periodic function is one that satisfies the relationship
(16.1)
where n is an integer (
) and T is the period. The func-
tion shown in Fig. 16.1 is periodic because
for any arbitrarily chosen value of 
Note that T is the smallest
time interval that a periodic function may be shifted (in either
direction) to produce a function that is identical to itself.
Why the interest in periodic functions? One reason is that
many electrical sources of practical value generate periodic
waveforms. For example, nonfiltered electronic rectifiers driven

Electronic oscillators, which are useful in laboratory testing of

waveforms. Function generators, which are capable of producing
square-wave, triangular-wave, and rectangular-pulse waveforms,
are found in most testing laboratories. Figure 16.4 on page 604

CHAPTER

In Chapters 14 and 15, we discovered that an important char-
acteristic of bandpass and bandreject filters is the quality fac-
tor, Q. The quality factor provides a measure of how selective
the filter is at its center frequency. For example, a bandpass fil-
ter with a large value of Q will amplify signals at or near its
center frequency and will attentuate signals at all other fre-
quencies. On the other hand, a bandreject filter with a small
value of Q will not effectively distinguish between signals at
the center frequency and signals at frequencies quite different
from the center frequency.
In this chapter, we learn that any periodic signal can be
represented as a sum of sinusoids, where the frequencies of the
sinusoids in the sum are comprised of the frequency of the
periodic signal and integer multiples of that frequency. We can
use a periodic signal like a square wave to test the quality fac-
tor of a bandpass or bandreject filter. To do this, we choose a
square wave whose frequency is the same as the center fre-
quency of a bandpass filter, for example. If the bandpass filter
has a high quality factor, its output will be nearly sinusoidal,
thereby transforming the input square wave into an output
sinusoid. If the filter has a low quality factor, its output will
still look like a square wave, as the filter is not able to select
from among the sinusoids that make up the input square wave.
We present an example at the end of this chapter.

Another practical problem that stimulates interest in periodic func-
tions is that power generators, although designed to produce a sinusoidal
waveform, cannot in practice be made to produce a pure sine wave. The
distorted sinusoidal wave, however, is periodic. Engineers naturally are
interested in ascertaining the consequences of exciting power systems
with a slightly distorted sinusoidal voltage.
Interest in periodic functions also stems from the general observation
that any nonlinearity in an otherwise linear circuit creates a nonsinusoidal
periodic function. The rectifier circuit alluded to earlier is one example of
this phenomenon. Magnetic saturation, which occurs in both machines
and transformers, is another example of a nonlinearity that generates a
nonsinusoidal periodic function.An electronic clipping circuit, which uses
transistor saturation, is yet another example.
Moreover, nonsinusoidal periodic functions are important in the
analysis of nonelectrical systems. Problems involving mechanical vibra-
tion, fluid flow, and heat flow all make use of periodic functions. In fact,
the study and analysis of heat flow in a metal rod led the French mathe-
matician Jean Baptiste Joseph Fourier (1768–1830) to the trigonometric
series representation of a periodic function.This series bears his name and
is the starting point for finding the steady-state response to periodic exci-
tations of electric circuits.

16.1 Fourier Series Analysis: 
An Overview
What Fourier discovered in investigating heat-flow problems is that a
periodic function can be represented by an infinite sum of sine or cosine
functions that are harmonically related. In other words, the period of any
trigonometric term in the infinite series is an integral multiple, or har-
monic, of the fundamental period T of the periodic function.Thus for peri-
odic 
Fourier showed that 
can be expressed as
(16.2)
where n is the integer sequence 1, 2, 3, . . . .
In Eq. 16.2,
and 
are known as the Fourier coefficients and are
calculated from 
The term 
(which equals 
) represents the
fundamental frequency of the periodic function 
The integral multi-
ples of 
—that is,
and so on—are known as the harmonic
frequencies of 
Thus 
is the second harmonic,
is the third har-
monic, and 
is the nth harmonic of 
We discuss the determination of the Fourier coefficients in
Section 16.2. Before pursuing the details of using a Fourier series in circuit
analysis, we first need to look at the process in general terms. From an
applications point of view, we can express all the periodic functions of
interest in terms of a Fourier series. Mathematically, the conditions on a
periodic function 
that ensure expressing 
as a convergent Fourier
series (known as Dirichlet’s conditions) are that
1.
be single-valued,
2.
have a finite number of discontinuities in the periodic interval,
3.
have a finite number of maxima and minima in the periodic
interval,
4. the integral
exists.
Any periodic function generated by a physically realizable source satisfies
Dirichlet’s conditions. These are sufficient conditions, not necessary con-
ditions. Thus if 
meets these requirements, we know that we can
express it as a Fourier series. However, if 
does not meet these require-
ments, we still may be able to express it as a Fourier series. The necessary
conditions on 
are not known.
After we have determined 
and calculated the Fourier coefficients
(
and 
), we resolve the periodic source into a dc source (
) plus a
sum of sinusoidal sources (
and 
). Because the periodic source is driv-
ing a linear circuit, we may use the principle of superposition to find the
steady-state response. In particular, we first calculate the response to each
source generated by the Fourier series representation of 
and then add
the individual responses to obtain the total response. The steady-state
response owing to a specific sinusoidal source is most easily found with
the phasor method of analysis.
The procedure is straightforward and involves no new techniques of
circuit analysis. It produces the Fourier series representation of the
steady-state response; consequently, the actual shape of the response is

unknown. Furthermore, the response waveform can be estimated only by
adding a sufficient number of terms together. Even though the Fourier
series approach to finding the steady-state response does have some draw-
backs, it introduces a way of thinking about a problem that is as important
as getting quantitative results. In fact, the conceptual picture is even more
important in some respects than the quantitative one.
16.2 The Fourier Coefficients
After defining a periodic function over its fundamental period, we deter-
mine the Fourier coefficients from the relationships

Finding the Fourier coefficients, in general, is tedious. Therefore any-
thing that simplifies the task is beneficial. Fortunately, a periodic function
that possesses certain types of symmetry greatly reduces the amount of
work involved in finding the coefficients. In Section 16.3, we discuss how
symmetry affects the coefficients in a Fourier series.

16.3 The Effect of Symmetry 
on the Fourier Coefficients
Four types of symmetry may be used to simplify the task of evaluating the
Fourier coefficients:
•
even-function symmetry,
•
odd-function symmetry,
•
half-wave symmetry,
•
quarter-wave symmetry.
The effect of each type of symmetry on the Fourier coefficients is discussed
in the following sections.
Even-Function Symmetry
A function is defined as even if
(16.13)
Functions that satisfy Eq. 16.13 are said to be even because polynomial
functions with only even exponents possess this characteristic. For even
periodic functions, the equations for the Fourier coefficients reduce to
(16.14)
(16.15)
(16.16)
Note that all the b coefficients are zero if the periodic function is even.
Figure 16.6 illustrates an even periodic function. The derivations of
Eqs. 16.14–16.16 follow directly from Eqs. 16.3–16.5. In each derivation,
we select 
and then break the interval of integration into the
range from

right-hand side of Eq. 16.17. Specifically, we let

Combining Eq. 16.20 with Eq. 16.19 yields Eq. 16.15.

gration from 0 to

functions with only odd exponents have this characteristic. The expres-
sions for the Fourier coefficients are

The Effect of Symmetry on the Fourier Coefficients
611
We use the same process to derive Eqs. 16.23–16.25 that we used to
derive Eqs. 16.14–16.16.We leave the derivations to you in Problem 16.7.
The evenness, or oddness, of a periodic function can be destroyed by
shifting the function along the time axis. In other words, the judicious
choice of where 
may give a periodic function even or odd symmetry.
For example, the triangular function shown in Fig. 16.8(a) is neither even
nor odd. However, we can make the function even, as shown in
Fig. 16.8(b), or odd, as shown in Fig. 16.8(c).
Half-Wave Symmetry
A periodic function possesses half-wave symmetry if it satisfies the
constraint
(16.26)
Equation 16.26 states that a periodic function has half-wave symmetry if,
after it is shifted one-half period and inverted, it is identical to the original
function. For example, the functions shown in Figs. 16.7 and 16.8 have half-
wave symmetry, whereas those in Figs. 16.5 and 16.6 do not. Note that half-
wave symmetry is not a function of where 
If a periodic function has half-wave symmetry, both 
and 
are zero
for even values of k. Moreover,
also is zero because the average value
of a function with half-wave symmetry is zero. The expressions for the
Fourier coefficients are

Fourier Series
Now we change a variable in the first integral on the right-hand side of
Eq. 16.32. Specifically, we let

is 1 when k is even and 
when k is odd.Therefore Eq. 16.35
generates Eqs. 16.28 and 16.29.
We leave it to you to verify that this same process can be used to
derive Eqs. 16.30 and 16.31 (see Problem 16.8).
We summarize our observations by noting that the Fourier series rep-
resentation of a periodic function with half-wave symmetry has zero aver-

has quarter-wave symmetry about the midpoint of the positive and nega-
tive half-cycles. The function in Fig. 16.9(b) does not have quarter-wave
symmetry, although it does have half-wave symmetry.
A periodic function that has quarter-wave symmetry can always be
made either even or odd by the proper choice of the point where 
For example, the function shown in Fig. 16.9(a) is odd and can be made
even by shifting the function 
units either right or left along the t axis.
However, the function in Fig. 16.9(b) can never be made either even or
odd.To take advantage of quarter-wave symmetry in the calculation of the
Fourier coefficients, you must choose the point where 
to make the
function either even or odd.
If the function is made even, then
(16.36)
Equations 16.36 result from the function’s quarter-wave symmetry in
addition to its being even. Recall that quarter-wave symmetry is super-
imposed on half-wave symmetry, so we can eliminate 
and 
for k even.
Comparing the expression for 
k odd, in Eqs. 16.36 with Eq. 16.29 shows
that combining quarter-wave symmetry with evenness allows the shorten-
ing of the range of integration from 0 to 
to 0 to 
We leave the der-
ivation of Eqs. 16.36 to you in Problem 16.9.
If the quarter-wave symmetric function is made odd,
(16.37)
Equations 16.37 are a direct consequence of quarter-wave symmetry and
oddness.Again, quarter-wave symmetry allows the shortening of the inter-
val of integration from 0 to 
to 0 to

Eqs. 16.37 to you in Problem 16.10.

We begin by looking for degrees of symmetry in the

addition, has half-wave and quarter-wave symme-

16.4 An Alternative Trigonometric Form
of the Fourier Series
In circuit applications of the Fourier series, we combine the cosine and
sine terms in the series into a single term for convenience. Doing so allows
the representation of each harmonic of 
or 
as a single phasor quan-
tity. The cosine and sine terms may be merged in either a cosine expres-
sion or a sine expression. Because we chose the cosine format in the
phasor method of analysis (see Chapter 9), we choose the cosine expres-
sion here for the alternative form of the series. Thus we write the Fourier
series in Eq. 16.2 as
(16.38)
where 
and 
are defined by the complex quantity
(16.39)
We derive Eqs. 16.38 and 16.39 using the phasor method to add the cosine
and sine terms in Eq. 16.2. We begin by expressing the sine functions as
cosine functions; that is, we rewrite Eq. 16.2 as
(16.40)
Adding the terms under the summation sign by using phasors gives
(16.41)
and
(16.42)
Then
(16.43)
When we inverse-transform Eq. 16.43, we get
(16.44)
Substituting Eq. 16.44 into Eq. 16.40 yields Eq. 16.38. Equation 16.43
corresponds to Eq. 16.39. If the periodic function is either even or odd,
reduces to either 
(even) or 
(odd), and 
is either 
(even) or
(odd).
The derivation of the alternative form of the Fourier series for a given
periodic function is illustrated in Example 16.3.

voltage. (a) The RC series circuit. (b) The square-wave
voltage.
16.5 An Application
Now we illustrate how to use a Fourier series representation of a periodic
excitation function to find the steady-state response of a linear circuit.The
RC circuit shown in Fig. 16.12(a) will provide our example. The circuit is
energized with the periodic square-wave voltage shown in Fig. 16.12(b).
The voltage across the capacitor is the desired response, or output, signal.
The first step in finding the steady-state response is to represent the peri-
odic excitation source with its Fourier series.After noting that the source has
odd, half-wave, and quarter-wave symmetry, we know that the Fourier
coefficients reduce to 
with k restricted to odd integer values:
(16.45)
Then the Fourier series representation of 
is
(16.46)
Writing the series in expanded form, we have
(16.47)
The voltage source expressed by Eq. 16.47 is the equivalent of infi-
nitely many series-connected sinusoidal sources, each source having its
own amplitude and frequency. To find the contribution of each source to
the output voltage, we use the principle of superposition.
For any one of the sinusoidal sources, the phasor-domain expression
for the output voltage is
(16.48)
All the voltage sources are expressed as sine functions, so we interpret a
phasor in terms of the sine instead of the cosine. In other words, when we
go from the phasor domain back to the time domain, we simply write the
time-domain expressions as 
instead of 
The phasor output voltage owing to the fundamental frequency of the
sinusoidal source is
(16.49)
Writing 
in polar form gives

Fourier Series
From Eq. 16.50, the time-domain expression for the fundamental fre-
quency component of 
is
(16.52)
We derive the third-harmonic component of the output voltage in a simi-
lar manner.The third-harmonic phasor voltage is
(16.53)
where
(16.54)
The time-domain expression for the third-harmonic output voltage is
(16.55)
Hence the expression for the kth-harmonic component of the output
voltage is
(16.56)
where
(16.57)
We now write down the Fourier series representation of the output
voltage:
(16.58)
The derivation of Eq. 16.58 was not difficult. But, although we have an ana-
lytic expression for the steady-state output,what 
looks like is not imme-
diately apparent from Eq.16.58.As we mentioned earlier,this shortcoming is
a problem with the Fourier series approach. Equation 16.58 is not useless,
however, because it gives some feel for the steady-state waveform of 
if
we focus on the frequency response of the circuit. For example, if C is large,
is small for the higher order harmonics.Thus the capacitor short cir-
cuits the high-frequency components of the input waveform, and the higher
order harmonics in Eq.16.58 are negligible compared to the lower order har-
monics. Equation 16.58 reflects this condition in that, for large C,
(16.59)
Equation 16.59 shows that the amplitude of the harmonic in the output
is decreasing by 
compared with 
for the input harmonics. If C is
so large that only the fundamental component is significant, then to a
first approximation

and Fourier analysis tells us that the square-wave input is deformed into a
sinusoidal output.
Now let’s see what happens as 
The circuit shows that 
and 
are the same when 
because the capacitive branch looks like an
open circuit at all frequencies. Equation 16.58 predicts the same result
because, as 
(16.61)
But Eq. 16.61 is identical to Eq. 16.46, and therefore 
as 
Thus Eq. 16.58 has proven useful because it enabled us to predict that
the output will be a highly distorted replica of the input waveform if C is
large, and a reasonable replica if C is small. In Chapter 13, we looked at
the distortion between the input and output in terms of how much mem-
ory the system weighting function had. In the frequency domain, we look
at the distortion between the steady-state input and output in terms of
how the amplitude and phase of the harmonics are altered as they are
transmitted through the circuit. When the network significantly alters the
amplitude and phase relationships among the harmonics at the output rel-
ative to that at the input, the output is a distorted version of the input.
Thus, in the frequency domain, we speak of amplitude distortion and
phase distortion.
For the circuit here, amplitude distortion is present because the ampli-
tudes of the input harmonics decrease as 
whereas the amplitudes of
the output harmonics decrease as
.
This circuit also exhibits phase distortion because the phase angle of each
input harmonic is zero, whereas that of the nth harmonic in the output sig-
nal is 
An Application of the Direct Approach 
to the Steady-State Response
For the simple RC circuit shown in Fig. 16.12(a), we can derive the expres-
sion for the steady-state response without resorting to the Fourier series
representation of the excitation function. Doing this extra analysis here
adds to our understanding of the Fourier series approach.
To find the steady-state expression for 
by straightforward circuit
analysis, we reason as follows. The square-wave excitation function alter-
nates between charging the capacitor toward 
and 
After the
circuit reaches steady-state operation, this alternate charging becomes
periodic.We know from the analysis of the single time-constant RC circuit
(Chapter 7) that the response to abrupt changes in the driving voltage is
exponential. Thus the steady-state waveform of the voltage across the
capacitor in the circuit shown in Fig. 16.12(a) is as shown in Fig. 16.13.
The analytic expressions for 
in the time intervals 
and 
are
(16.62)
(16.63)
We derive Eqs. 16.62 and 16.63 by using the methods of Chapter 7, as sum-

Solving Eqs. 16.64 and 16.65 for

(16.66)
Substituting Eq. 16.66 into Eqs. 16.62 and 16.63 gives
(16.67)
and
(16.68)
Equations 16.67 and 16.68 indicate that 
has half-wave symmetry
and that therefore the average value of 
is zero.This result agrees with
the Fourier series solution for the steady-state response—namely, that
because the excitation function has no zero frequency component, the
response can have no such component. Equations 16.67 and 16.68 also
show the effect of changing the size of the capacitor. If C is small, the
exponential functions quickly vanish,
between 0 and 
and
between 
and T. In other words,
as 
If C is
large, the output waveform becomes triangular in shape, as Fig. 16.14
shows. Note that for large C, we may approximate the exponential
terms 
and e
by the linear terms 
and
respectively. Equation 16.59 gives the Fourier
series of this triangular waveform.
Figure 16.14 summarizes the results. The dashed line in Fig. 16.14 is
the input voltage, the solid colored line depicts the output voltage when
C is small,and the solid black line depicts the output voltage when C is large.
Finally, we verify that the steady-state response of Eqs. 16.67 and
16.68 is equivalent to the Fourier series solution in Eq. 16.58. To do so we
simply derive the Fourier series representation of the periodic function
described by Eqs. 16.67 and 16.68.We have already noted that the periodic
voltage response has half-wave symmetry. Therefore the Fourier series
contains only odd harmonics. For k odd,

Average-Power Calculations with Periodic Functions
621
We leave you to verify Eqs. 16.69–16.72 in Problems 16.23 and 16.24.
Equations 16.71 and 16.72 are used with Eqs. 16.38 and 16.39 to derive the
Fourier series expression in Eq. 16.58; we leave the details to you in
Problem 16.25.
With this illustrative circuit, we showed how to use the Fourier series
in conjunction with the principle of superposition to obtain the steady-
state response to a periodic driving function. Again, the principal short-
coming of the Fourier series approach is the difficulty of ascertaining the
waveform of the response. However, by thinking in terms of a circuit’s fre-

16.6 Average-Power Calculations
with Periodic Functions
If we have the Fourier series representation of the voltage and current at
a pair of terminals in a linear lumped-parameter circuit, we can easily
express the average power at the terminals as a function of the harmonic
voltages and currents. Using the trigonometric form of the Fourier series

622
Fourier Series
expressed in Eq. 16.38, we write the periodic voltage and current at the
terminals of a network as
(16.73)
(16.74)
The notation used in Eqs. 16.73 and 16.74 is defined as follows:
We assume that the current reference is in the direction of the refer-
ence voltage drop across the terminals (using the passive sign conven-
tion), so that the instantaneous power at the terminals is 
. The average
power is
(16.75)
To find the expression for the average power, we substitute Eqs. 16.73 and
16.74 into Eq. 16.75 and integrate. At first glance, this appears to be a for-
midable task, because the product 
requires multiplying two infinite
series. However, the only terms to survive integration are the products of
voltage and current at the same frequency. A review of Eqs. 16.8–16.10
should convince you of the validity of this observation. Therefore
Eq. 16.75 reduces to
(16.76)
Now, using the trigonometric identity
we simplify Eq. 16.76 to
(16.77)
The second term under the integral sign integrates to zero, so
(16.78)
Equation 16.78 is particularly important because it states that in the case
of an interaction between a periodic voltage and the corresponding periodic
current, the total average power is the sum of the average powers obtained
from the interaction of currents and voltages of the same frequency.Currents
and voltages of different frequencies do not interact to produce average

tions, the total average power is the superposition of the average powers
associated with each harmonic voltage and current. Example 16.4 illustrates
the computation of average power involving a periodic voltage.

16.7 The rms Value of a Periodic Function
The rms value of a periodic function can be expressed in terms of the
Fourier coefficients; by definition,
(16.79)
Representing 
by its Fourier series yields
(16.80)
The integral of the squared time function simplifies because the only
terms to survive integration over a period are the product of the dc term
and the harmonic products of the same frequency.All other products inte-
grate to zero.Therefore Eq. 16.80 reduces to
(16.81)
Equation 16.81 states that the rms value of a periodic function is the
square root of the sum obtained by adding the square of the rms value of
each harmonic to the square of the dc value. For example, let’s assume that
a periodic voltage is represented by the finite series
The rms value of this voltage is
Usually, infinitely many terms are required to represent a periodic func-
tion by a Fourier series, and therefore Eq. 16.81 yields an estimate of the
true rms value.We illustrate this result in Example 16.5.

Next we note that
(16.90)
Substituting Eqs. 16.87, 16.89, and 16.90 into Eq. 16.86 yields

Note that the second summation on the right-hand side of Eq. 16.91 is
equivalent to summing 
from

Because the summation from

Fourier Series
16.9 Amplitude and Phase Spectra
A periodic time function is defined by its Fourier coefficients and its period.
In other words, when we know 
,
,
, and T, we can construct 
, at
least theoretically. When we know 
and 
, we also know the amplitude
(
) and phase angle (
) of each harmonic.Again, we cannot, in general,
visualize what the periodic function looks like in the time domain from a
description of the coefficients and phase angles; nevertheless, we recognize
that these quantities characterize the periodic function completely. Thus,
with sufficient computing time, we can synthesize the time-domain wave-
form from the amplitude and phase angle data. Also, when a periodic driv-
ing function is exciting a circuit that is highly frequency selective, the
Fourier series of the steady-state response is dominated by just a few terms.
Thus the description of the response in terms of amplitude and phase may
provide an understanding of the output waveform.
We can present graphically the description of a periodic function in
terms of the amplitude and phase angle of each term in the Fourier series
of 
The plot of the amplitude of each term versus the frequency is
called the amplitude spectrum of 
and the plot of the phase angle ver-
sus the frequency is called the phase spectrum of 
Because the ampli-
tude and phase angle data occur at discrete values of the frequency (that
is, at 
,
,
these plots also are referred to as line spectra.
An Illustration of Amplitude and Phase Spectra
Amplitude and phase spectra plots are based on either Eq. 16.38 (
and
) or Eq. 16.82 (
).We focus on Eq. 16.82 and leave the plots based on
Eq. 16.38 to Problem 16.49. To illustrate the amplitude and phase spectra,
which are based on the exponential form of the Fourier series, we use the
periodic voltage of Example 16.6. To aid the discussion, we assume that
and 
From Example 16.6,

and reduces to
(16.99)
Figure 16.16 illustrates the plot of the magnitude of 
from Eq. 16.99 for
values of n ranging from 
to 
. The figure clearly shows that the
amplitude spectrum is bounded by the envelope of the 
func-
tion.We used the order of the harmonic as the frequency scale because the
numerical value of T is not specified. When we know T, we also know 
and the frequency corresponding to each harmonic.
Figure 16.17 provides the plot of 
versus x, where x is in
radians. It shows that the function goes through zero whenever x is an
integral multiple of 
From Eq. 16.98,
(16.100)
From Eq. 16.100, we deduce that the amplitude spectrum goes through
zero whenever 
is an integer. For example, in the plot,

the reciprocal of 
becomes an increasingly larger integer, the number
of harmonics between every

is not an integer,
the amplitude spectrum still follows the 
envelope. However,
the envelope is not zero at an integral multiple of

itself as n takes on larger integer values. Figure 16.18 shows the phase

given by Eq. 16.98.
Now, what happens to the amplitude and phase spectra if 
is
shifted along the time axis? To find out, we shift the periodic voltage in
Example 16.6
units to the right. By hypothesis,
(16.101)
Therefore
(16.102)
which indicates that shifting the origin has no effect on the amplitude spec-
trum, because
(16.103)
However, reference to Eq. 16.87 reveals that the phase spectrum has
changed to 
rads. For example, let’s shift the periodic voltage
in Example 16.1
units to the right.As before, we assume that 
then the new phase angle 
is
(16.104)
We have plotted Eq. 16.104 in Fig. 16.19 for n ranging from 
to 
Note
that no phase angle is associated with a zero amplitude coefficient.
You may wonder why we have devoted so much attention to the
amplitude spectrum of the periodic pulse in Example 16.6. The reason is
that this particular periodic waveform provides an excellent way to illus-
trate the transition from the Fourier series representation of a periodic
function to the Fourier transform representation of a nonperiodic func-
tion.We discuss the Fourier transform in Chapter 17.

Practical Perspective
Active High-Q Filters
Consider the narrowband op amp bandpass filter shown in Fig. 16.20(a). The
square wave voltage shown in Fig. 16.20(b) is the input to the filter. We
know that the square wave is comprised of an infinite sum of sinusoids, one
sinusoid at the same frequency as the square wave and all of the remaining
sinusoids at integer multiples of that frequency. What effect will the filter
have on this input sum of sinusoids?

The Fourier series representation of the square wave in Fig. 16.20(b) is
given by
where 
. The first three terms of this Fourier series are given by
The period of the square wave is 
so the frequency of the square
wave is 
. 
The transfer function for the bandpass filter in Fig. 16.20(a) is 
where 
, 
, 
. This filter has
a quality factor of 
. Note that the center frequency of the
bandpass filter equals the frequency of the input square wave. 
Multiply each term of the Fourier series representation of the square
wave, represented as a phasor, by the transfer function 
evaluated at
the frequency of the term in the Fourier series to get the representation of
the output voltage of the filter as a Fourier series:  
Notice the selective nature of the bandpass filter, which effectively
amplifies the fundamental frequency component of the input square wave
and attenuates all of the harmonic components. 
Now make the following changes to the bandpass filter of Fig. 16.20(a)
— let 
, 
, 
, and 
. The transfer function for the filter, 
, has the same form given above,
but now 
, 
, 
. The pass-
band gain and center frequency are unchanged, but the bandwidth has
increased by a factor of 10. This makes the quality factor 2, and the result-
ing bandpass filter is less selective than the original filter. We can see this
by looking at the output voltage of the filter as a Fourier series:  
The fundamental frequency of the input has the same amplification fac-
tor, but the higher harmonic components have not been attenuated as signif-
icantly as they were when the filter with 
was used. Figure 16.21 plots
the first three terms of the Fourier series representations of the input square
wave and the resulting output waveforms for the two bandpass filters. Note
the nearly perfect replication of a sinusoid in Fig. 16.21(b) and the distortion
that results from the use of a less-selective filter in Fig. 16.21(c).

Summary
•
A periodic function is a function that repeats itself
every T seconds.
•
A period is the smallest time interval (T ) that a peri-
odic function can be shifted to produce a function iden-
tical to itself. (See page 602.)
• The Fourier series is an infinite series used to represent
a periodic function. The series consists of a constant
term and infinitely many harmonically related cosine
and sine terms. (See page 605.)
•
The fundamental frequency is the frequency determined
by the fundamental period (
or 
).
(See page 605.)
•
The harmonic frequency is an integer multiple of the
fundamental frequency. (See page 605.)
•
The Fourier coefficients are the constant term and the
coefficient of each cosine and sine term in the series.
(See Eqs. 16.3–16.5.) (See page 606.)
v0 = 2pf0
f0 = 1>T
•
Five types of symmetry are used to simplify the compu-
tation of the Fourier coefficients:
•
even, in which all sine terms in the series are zero
•
odd, in which all cosine terms and the constant term
are zero
•
half-wave, in which all even harmonics are zero
•
quarter-wave, half-wave, even, in which the series
contains only odd harmonic cosine terms
•
quarter-wave, half-wave, odd, in which the series con-
tains only odd harmonic sine terms
(See page 609.)
•
In the alternative form of the Fourier series, each har-
monic represented by the sum of a cosine and sine
term is combined into a single term of the form
. (See page 615.)
An cos(nv0t - un)
NOTE: Assess your understanding of the Practical Perspective by solving Chapter Problems 16.56–16.57.

•
For steady-state response, the Fourier series of the
response signal is determined by first finding 
the response to each component of the input signal.The
individual responses are added (super-imposed) to
form the Fourier series of the response signal. The
response to the individual terms in the input series is
found by either frequency domain or s-domain analysis.
(See page 617.)
•
The waveform of the response signal is difficult to obtain
without the aid of a computer. Sometimes the frequency
response (or filtering) characteristics of the circuit can
be used to ascertain how closely the output waveform
matches the input waveform. (See page 618.)
•
Only harmonics of the same frequency interact to pro-
duce average power.The total average power is the sum
of the average powers associated with each frequency.
(See page 621.)
•
The rms value of a periodic function can be estimated
from the Fourier coefficients. (See Eqs. 16.81, 16.94, and
16.97.) (See page 624.)
•
The Fourier series may also be written in exponential
form by using Euler’s identity to replace the cosine and
sine terms with their exponential equivalents. (See
page 625.)
•
The Fourier series is used to predict the steady-state
response of a system when the system is excited by a
periodic signal. The series assists in finding the steady-
state response by transferring the analysis from the time
domain to the frequency domain.

16.18 It is sometimes possible to use symmetry to find

tion is not symmetrical! With this thought in mind,
consider the function in Fig P16.4. Observe that 
can be divided into the two functions illustrated in
Fig. P16.18(a) and (b).Furthermore,we can make 
an even function by shifting it 
units to the left.This
is illustrated in Fig.P16.18(c).At this point we note that
and that the Fourier series of

In Chapter 16, we discussed the representation of a periodic
function by means of a Fourier series. This series representation
enables us to describe the periodic function in terms of the
frequency-domain attributes of amplitude and phase.The Fourier
transform extends this frequency-domain description to functions
that are not periodic. Through the Laplace transform, we already
introduced the idea of transforming an aperiodic function from
the time domain to the frequency domain.You may wonder, then,
why yet another type of transformation is necessary. Strictly
speaking, the Fourier transform is not a new transform. It is a spe-
cial case of the bilateral Laplace transform, with the real part of
the complex frequency set equal to zero. However, in terms of
physical interpretation, the Fourier transform is better viewed as
a limiting case of a Fourier series.We present this point of view in
Section 17.1, where we derive the Fourier transform equations.
The Fourier transform is more useful than the Laplace trans-
form in certain communications theory and signal-processing sit-
uations. Although we cannot pursue the Fourier transform in
depth, its introduction here seems appropriate while the ideas
underlying the Laplace transform and the Fourier series are still
fresh in your mind.

CHAPTER

It is common to use telephone lines to communicate informa-
tion from one computer to another. As you may know, com-
puters represent all information as collections of 1’s and 0’s.
Usually the value 1 is represented as a voltage, usually 5 V,
and 0 is represented as 0 V, as shown below.
The telephone line has a frequency response characteristic
that is similar to a low pass filter. We can use Fourier trans-
forms to understand the effect of transmitting a digital value
using a telephone line that behaves like a filter.

The Fourier Transform
17.1 The Derivation of the 
Fourier Transform
We begin the derivation of the Fourier transform, viewed as a limiting case
of a Fourier series, with the exponential form of the series:
(17.1)
where
(17.2)
In Eq. 17.2, we elected to start the integration at 
Allowing the fundamental period T to increase without limit accom-
plishes the transition from a periodic to an aperiodic function. In other
words, if T becomes infinite, the function never repeats itself and hence is
aperiodic. As T increases, the separation between adjacent harmonic fre-
quencies becomes smaller and smaller. In particular,
(17.3)
and as T gets larger and larger, the incremental separation 
approaches
a differential separation 
. From Eq. 17.3,
(17.4)
As the period increases, the frequency moves from being a discrete vari-
able to becoming a continuous variable, or
(17.5)
In terms of Eq. 17.2, as the period increases, the Fourier coefficients 
get smaller. In the limit,
as 
. This result makes sense,
because we expect the Fourier coefficients to vanish as the function loses
its periodicity. Note, however, the limiting value of the product 
; that is,
(17.6)
In writing Eq. 17.6 we took advantage of the relationship in Eq. 17.5.
The integral in Eq. 17.6 is the Fourier transform of

17.1
The Derivation of the Fourier Transform
645
We obtain an explicit expression for the inverse Fourier transform by
investigating the limiting form of Eq. 17.1 as 
. We begin by multi-
plying and dividing by T :
(17.8)
As 
, the summation approaches integration,
,
, and 
.Thus in the limit, Eq. 17.8 becomes
(17.9)
Equations 17.7 and 17.9 define the Fourier transform. Equation 17.7 trans-
forms the time-domain expression 
into its corresponding frequency-
domain expression 
. Equation 17.9 defines the inverse operation of
transforming 
into 
.
Let’s now derive the Fourier transform of the pulse shown in Fig. 17.1.
Note that this pulse corresponds to the periodic voltage in Example 16.6 if
we let 
.The Fourier transform of 
comes directly from Eq. 17.7:
(17.10)
which can be put in the form of 
by multiplying the numerator
and denominator by .Then,
(17.11)
For the periodic train of voltage pulses in Example 16.6, the expression for
the Fourier coefficients is
(17.12)
Comparing Eqs. 17.11 and 17.12 clearly shows that, as the time-domain
function goes from periodic to aperiodic, the amplitude spectrum goes
from a discrete line spectrum to a continuous spectrum. Furthermore, the
envelope of the line spectrum has the same shape as the continuous spec-
trum.Thus, as T increases, the spectrum of lines gets denser and the ampli-
tudes get smaller, but the envelope doesn’t change shape. The physical
interpretation of the Fourier transform
is therefore a measure of the
frequency content of 
. Figure 17.2 illustrates these observations. The
amplitude spectrum plot is based on the assumption that is constant and
T is increasing.

The Fourier Transform
17.2 The Convergence of the 
Fourier Integral
A function of time 
has a Fourier transform if the integral in Eq. 17.7
converges. If 
is a well-behaved function that differs from zero over a
finite interval of time, convergence is no problem. Well-behaved implies
that 
is single valued and encloses a finite area over the range of inte-
gration. In practical terms, all the pulses of finite duration that interest us
are well-behaved functions.The evaluation of the Fourier transform of the
rectangular pulse discussed in Section 17.1 illustrates this point.
If 
is different from zero over an infinite interval, the convergence
of the Fourier integral depends on the behavior of 
as 
. A 
single-valued function that is nonzero over an infinite interval has a Fourier
transform if the integral

(17.13)
A third important group of functions have great practical interest but
do not in a strict sense have a Fourier transform. For example, the integral
in Eq. 17.7 doesn’t converge if 
is a constant. The same can be said if
is a sinusoidal function,
or a step function,
. These func-
tions are of great interest in circuit analysis, but, to include them in Fourier
analysis, we must resort to some mathematical subterfuge. First, we create
a function in the time domain that has a Fourier transform and at the same
time can be made arbitrarily close to the function of interest. Next, we find
the Fourier transform of the approximating function and then evaluate the
limiting value of 
as this function approaches 
. Last, we define 
the limiting value of 
as the Fourier transform of 
.
Let’s demonstrate this technique by finding the Fourier transform of a
constant.We can approximate a constant with the exponential function
(17.14)
As 
,
. Figure 17.4 shows the approximation graphically.The
Fourier transform of 
is
(17.15)
Carrying out the integration called for in Eq. 17.15 yields
(17.16)
The function given by Eq. 17.16 generates an impulse function at 
as
. You can verify this result by showing that (1) 
approaches
infinity at 
as 
; (2) the width of 
approaches zero as 
;
and (3) the area under 
is independent of 
The area under

17.3 Using Laplace Transforms 
to Find Fourier Transforms
We can use a table of unilateral, or one-sided, Laplace transform pairs to
find the Fourier transform of functions for which the Fourier integral con-
verges.The Fourier integral converges when all the poles of F(s) lie in the
left half of the s plane. Note that if F(s) has poles in the right half of the
s plane or along the imaginary axis,
does not satisfy the constraint that
exists.
The following rules apply to the use of Laplace transforms to find the
Fourier transforms of such functions.
1. If 
is zero for 
, we obtain the Fourier transform of 
from the Laplace transform of 
simply by replacing s by 
.Thus

In Section 17.4, we say more about Fourier transforms defined
through a limit process. Before doing so, in Section 17.3 we show how to
take advantage of the Laplace transform to find the Fourier transform of
functions for which the Fourier integral converges.

Then
2. Because the range of integration on the Fourier integral goes from
to 
, the Fourier transform of a negative-time function
exists. A negative-time function is nonzero for negative values of
time and zero for positive values of time. To find the Fourier trans-
form of such a function, we proceed as follows. First, we reflect the
negative-time function over to the positive-time domain and then
find its one-sided Laplace transform. We obtain the Fourier trans-
form of the original time function by replacing s with 
.
Therefore, when

17.4 Fourier Transforms in the Limit
As we pointed out in Section 17.2, the Fourier transforms of several prac-
tical functions must be defined by a limit process. We now return to these
types of functions and develop their transforms.
The Fourier Transform of a Signum Function
We showed that the Fourier transform of a constant A is 
in
Eq. 17.18. The next function of interest is the signum function, defined as
for 
and 
for 
.The signum function is denoted sgn(t) and
can be expressed in terms of unit-step functions, or
(17.24)
Figure 17.6 shows the function graphically.
To find the Fourier transform of the signum function, we first create a
function that approaches the signum function in the limit:
(17.25)
The function inside the brackets, plotted in Fig. 17.7, has a Fourier trans-
form because the Fourier integral converges. Because 
is an odd func-
tion, we use Eq. 17.23 to find its Fourier transform:
(17.26)

The Fourier Transform of a Unit Step Function
To find the Fourier transform of a unit step function, we use Eqs. 17.18 and
17.27. We do so by recognizing that the unit-step function can be
expressed as
(17.28)
Thus,
(17.29)
The Fourier Transform of a Cosine Function
To find the Fourier transform of 
, we return to the inverse-transform
integral of Eq. 17.9 and observe that if
(17.30)
then
(17.31)
Using the sifting property of the impulse function, we reduce Eq. (17.31) to
(17.32)
Then, from Eqs. 17.30 and 17.32,
(17.33)
We now use Eq. 17.33 to find the Fourier transform of 
, because

Operational Transforms
655
Now compare Eq. 17.44 with Eq. 17.40. Note that, except for a factor of
, these two equations have the same form. Thus, the waveforms of
and 
become interchangeable if 
is an even function. For
example, we have already observed that a rectangular pulse in the time
domain produces a frequency spectrum of the form 
. Specifically,
Eq. 17.11 expresses the Fourier transform of the voltage pulse shown in
Fig. 17.1. Hence a rectangular pulse in the frequency domain must be gen-
erated by a time-domain function of the form 
. We can illustrate
this requirement by finding the time-domain function 
corresponding
to the frequency spectrum shown in Fig. 17.8. From Eq. 17.44,
(17.45)
We say more about the frequency spectrum of a rectangular pulse in
the time domain versus the rectangular frequency spectrum of 
after we introduce Parseval’s theorem.
17.6 Operational Transforms
Fourier transforms, like Laplace transforms, can be classified as functional
and operational. So far, we have concentrated on the functional trans-
forms.We now discuss some of the important operational transforms.With
regard to the Laplace transform, these operational transforms are similar
to those discussed in Chapter 12. Hence we leave their proofs to you as
Problems 17.12–17.19.

Operational Transforms

Scale Change
Dimensionally, time and frequency are reciprocals. Therefore, when time
is stretched out, frequency is compressed (and vice versa), as reflected in
the functional transform
(17.51)
Note that when 
, time is stretched out, whereas when 
,
time is compressed.
Translation in the Time Domain
The effect of translating a function in the time domain is to alter the phase
spectrum and leave the amplitude spectrum untouched.Thus
(17.52)
If a is positive in Eq. 17.52, the time function is delayed, and if a is nega-
tive, the time function is advanced.
Translation in the Frequency Domain
Translation in the frequency domain corresponds to multiplication by the
complex exponential in the time domain:

Modulation
Amplitude modulation is the process of varying the amplitude of a sinu-
soidal carrier. If the modulating signal is denoted

17.7 Circuit Applications
The Laplace transform is used more widely to find the response of a cir-
cuit than is the Fourier transform, for two reasons. First, the Laplace trans-
form integral converges for a wider range of driving functions, and second,
it accommodates initial conditions. Despite the advantages of the Laplace
transform, we can use the Fourier transform to find the response.The fun-
damental relationship underlying the use of the Fourier transform in tran-
sient analysis is Eq. 17.55, which relates the transform of the response
to the transform of the input 
and the transfer function 
of
the circuit. Note that 
is the familiar 
with s replaced by

Use the Fourier transform to find

Figure 17.10 shows the response. Does the solu-
tion make sense in terms of known circuit behav-
ior? The answer is yes, for the following reasons.
The current source delivers 
to the circuit
between 
and 0. The resistance in each branch
governs how the 
divides between the two
branches. In particular, one fourth of the 
appears in the 
branch; therefore 
is 
for 
.
When the current source jumps from 
to
at 
,
approaches its final value of
exponentially with a time constant of 
An important characteristic of the Fourier
transform is that it directly yields the steady-state
response to a sinusoidal driving function. The rea-
son is that the Fourier transform of 
is based
on the assumption that the function exists over all
time. Example 17.2 illustrates this feature.

The Fourier Transform
17.8 Parseval’s Theorem
Parseval’s theorem relates the energy associated with a time-domain func-
tion of finite energy to the Fourier transform of the function. Imagine that
the time-domain function 
is either the voltage across or the current in
a 
resistor.The energy associated with this function then is
(17.57)
Parseval’s theorem holds that this same energy can be calculated by an
integration in the frequency domain, or specifically,
(17.58)
Therefore the 
energy associated with 
can be calculated either by
integrating the square of 
over all time or by integrating 
times
the square of the magnitude of the Fourier transform of 
over all fre-
quencies. Parseval’s theorem is valid if both integrals exist.
The average power associated with time-domain signals of finite
energy is zero when averaged over all time. Therefore, when comparing
signals of this type, we resort to the energy content of the signals. Using a
resistor as the base for the energy calculation is convenient for com-
paring the energy content of voltage and current signals.
We begin the derivation of Eq. 17.58 by rewriting the kernel of the
integral on the left-hand side as 
times itself and then expressing one
in terms of the inversion integral:
(17.59)
We move 
inside the interior integral, because the integration is with
respect to , and then factor the constant 
outside both integrations.
Thus Eq. 17.59 becomes
(17.60)
We reverse the order of integration and in so doing recognize that 
can be factored out of the integration with respect to t.Thus
(17.61)
The interior integral is 
, so Eq. 17.61 reduces to

Parseval’s Theorem
663
In Section 17.6, we noted that 
. Thus the product
is simply the magnitude of 
squared, and Eq. 17.62 is
equivalent to Eq. 17.58.We also noted that 
is an even function of 
Therefore, we can also write Eq. 17.58 as
(17.63)
A Demonstration of Parseval’s Theorem
We can best demonstrate the validity of Eq. 17.63 with a specific example. If
the left-hand side of Eq. 17.63 becomes
(17.64)
The Fourier transform of 
is
and therefore the right-hand side of Eq. 17.63 becomes
(17.65)
Note that the result given by Eq.17.65 is the same as that given by Eq.17.64.
The Interpretation of Parseval’s Theorem
Parseval’s theorem gives a physical interpretation that the magnitude of
the Fourier transform squared,
, is an energy density (in joules per
hertz).To see it, we write the right-hand side of Eq. 17.63 as
(17.66)
where 
is the energy in an infinitesimal band of frequencies
and the total 
energy associated with 
is the summation (inte-
gration) of 
over all frequencies. We can associate a portion
of the total energy with a specified band of frequencies. In other words,
the 
energy in the frequency band from

To aid our discussion, we have redrawn the voltage pulse and its Fourier
transform in Fig. 17.15(a) and (b), respectively.These figures show that, as
the width of the voltage pulse ( ) becomes smaller, the dominant portion
of the amplitude spectrum (that is, the spectrum from 
to 
)
spreads out over a wider range of frequencies. This result agrees with our
earlier comments about the operational transform involving a scale
change, in other words, when time is compressed, frequency is stretched
out and vice versa. To transmit a single rectangular pulse with reasonable
fidelity, the bandwidth of the system must be at least wide enough to
accommodate the dominant portion of the amplitude spectrum. Thus the
cutoff frequency should be at least 
, or 
We can use Parseval’s theorem to calculate the fraction of the total
energy associated with

can be calculated either from
the time-domain integration or the evaluation of Eq. 17.81 with the upper
limit equal to infinity. In either case, the total energy is
(17.83)
The fraction of the total energy associated with the band of frequencies
between 0 and 
is
(17.84)
Therefore, approximately 90% of the energy associated with

tained in the dominant portion of the amplitude spectrum.

Filtering Digital Signals
To understand the effect of transmitting a digital signal on a telephone line,
consider a simple pulse that represents a digital value of 1, using 5 V, as shown
in Fig. 17.15(a), with 
and 
The Fourier transform of this
pulse is shown in Fig. 17.15(b), where the amplitude 
and the first
positive zero-crossing on the frequency axis is 
Note that the digital pulse representing the value 1 is ideally a sum of
an infinite number of frequency components. But the telephone line cannot
transmit all of these frequency components. Typically, the telephone has a
bandwidth of 10 MHz, meaning that it is capable of transmitting only those
frequency components below 10 MHz. This causes the original pulse to be
distorted once it is received by the computer on the other end of the tele-
phone line, as seen in Fig. 17.16.
2p/t = 6.28 Mrad/s = 1 MHz.
Vmt = 5 mV
t = 1 ms.

Summary
•
The Fourier transform gives a frequency-domain descrip-
tion of an aperiodic time-domain function.Depending on
the nature of the time-domain signal, one of three
approaches to finding its Fourier transform may be used:
•
If the time-domain signal is a well-behaved pulse of
finite duration, the integral that defines the Fourier
transform is used.
•
If the one-sided Laplace transform of 
exists and
all the poles of 
lie in the left half of the s plane,
may be used to find F( ).
•
If 
is a constant, a signum function, a step func-
tion, or a sinusoidal function, the Fourier transform is
found by using a limit process.
(See page 646.)
•
Functional and operational Fourier transforms that are
useful in circuit analysis are tabulated in Tables 17.1 and
17.2. (See pages 655 and 660.)

F(s)
F(s)
f(t)
•
The Fourier transform of a response signal y(t) is
where X( ) is the Fourier transform of the input signal
x(t), and H( ) is the transfer function H(s) evaluated at
. (See page 660.)
•
The Fourier transform accommodates both negative-
time and positive-time functions and therefore is suited
to problems described in terms of events that start at
. In contrast, the unilateral Laplace transform is
suited to problems described in terms of initial condi-
tions and events that occur for 
.
• The magnitude of the Fourier transform squared is a
measure of the energy density (joules per hertz) in the
frequency domain (Parseval’s theorem).Thus the Fourier
transform permits us to associate a fraction of the total
energy contained in 
with a specified band of fre-
quencies. (See page 664.)

Problems 
675

We have frequently focused on the behavior of a circuit at a
specified pair of terminals. Recall that we introduced the
Thévenin and Norton equivalent circuits solely to simplify circuit
analysis relative to a pair of terminals. In analyzing some electri-
cal systems, focusing on two pairs of terminals is also convenient.
In particular, this is helpful when a signal is fed into one pair of
terminals and then, after being processed by the system, is
extracted at a second pair of terminals. Because the terminal
pairs represent the points where signals are either fed in or
extracted, they are referred to as the ports of the system. In this
chapter, we limit the discussion to circuits that have one input and
one output port. Figure 18.1 on page 678 illustrates the basic two-
port building block. Use of this building block is subject to sev-
eral restrictions. First, there can be no energy stored within the
circuit. Second, there can be no independent sources within the
circuit; dependent sources, however, are permitted.Third, the cur-
rent into the port must equal the current out of the port; that is,
and 
. Fourth, all external connections must be made
to either the input port or the output port; no such connections are
allowed between ports, that is, between terminals a and c, a and d,
b and c, or b and d.These restrictions simply limit the range of cir-
cuit problems to which the two-port formulation is applicable.
The fundamental principle underlying two-port modeling of a
system is that only the terminal variables ( ,
,
, and 
) are of
interest. We have no interest in calculating the currents and volt-
ages inside the circuit.We have already stressed terminal behavior
in the analysis of operational amplifier circuits. In this chapter, we
formalize that approach by introducing the two-port parameters.

Up to this point, whenever we wanted to create a model of a
circuit, we needed to know what types of components make
up the circuit, the values of those components, and the inter-
connections among those components. But what if we want
to model a circuit that is inside a "black box", where the com-
ponents, their values, and their interconnections are hidden?
In this chapter, we will discover that we can perform two
simple experiments on such a black box to create a model
that consists of just 4 values – the two-port parameter model
for the circuit. We can then use the two-port parameter
model to predict the behavior of the circuit once we have
attached a power source to one of its ports and a load to the
other port.
In this example, suppose we have found a circuit,
enclosed in a casing, with two wires extending from each
side, as shown below. The casing is labeled "amplifier" and we
want to determine whether or not it would be safe to use this
amplifier to connect a music player modeled as a 
source
to a speaker modeled as a 32 
resistor with a power rating
of

Two-Port Circuits
18.1 The Terminal Equations
In viewing a circuit as a two-port network, we are interested in relating the
current and voltage at one port to the current and voltage at the other
port. Figure 18.1 shows the reference polarities of the terminal voltages
and the reference directions of the terminal currents. The references at
each port are symmetric with respect to each other; that is, at each port the
current is directed into the upper terminal, and each port voltage is a rise
from the lower to the upper terminal. This symmetry makes it easier to
generalize the analysis of a two-port network and is the reason for its uni-
versal use in the literature.
The most general description of the two-port network is carried out in
the s domain. For purely resistive networks, the analysis reduces to solving
resistive circuits. Sinusoidal steady-state problems can be solved either by
first finding the appropriate s-domain expressions and then replacing s
with 
or by direct analysis in the frequency domain. Here, we write all
equations in the s domain; resistive networks and sinusoidal steady-state
solutions become special cases. Figure 18.2 shows the basic building block
in terms of the s-domain variables 
and 
Of these four terminal variables, only two are independent. Thus for
any circuit, once we specify two of the variables, we can find the two
remaining unknowns. For example, knowing 
and 
and the circuit
within the box, we can determine 
and 
Thus we can describe a two-
port network with just two simultaneous equations. However, there are six
different ways in which to combine the four variables:
(18.1)
(18.2)
(18.3)
(18.4)
(18.5)
(18.6)
These six sets of equations may also be considered as three pairs of
mutually inverse relations. The first set, Eqs. 18.1, gives the input and out-
put voltages as functions of the input and output currents.The second set,
Eqs. 18.2, gives the inverse relationship, that is, the input and output cur-
rents as functions of the input and output voltages. Equations 18.3 and
18.4 are inverse relations, as are Eqs. 18.5 and 18.6.
The coefficients of the current and/or voltage variables on the right-
hand side of Eqs. 18.1–18.6 are called the parameters of the two-port cir-
cuit.Thus, when using Eqs. 18.1, we refer to the z parameters of the circuit.
Similarly, we refer to the y parameters, the a parameters, the b parameters,
the h parameters, and the g parameters of the network.
 V2 = g21V1 + g22I2.
 I1 = g11V1 + g12I2,
 I2 = h21I1 + h22V2;
 V1 = h11I1 + h12V2,
 I2 = b21V1 - b22I1;
 V2 = b11V1 - b12I1,
 I1 = a21V2 - a22I2;
 V1 = a11V2 - a12I2,
 I2 = y21V1 + y22V2;

18.2 The Two-Port Parameters
We can determine the parameters for any circuit by computation or meas-
urement. The computation or measurement to be made comes directly
from the parameter equations. For example, suppose that the problem is
to find the z parameters for a circuit. From Eqs. 18.1,
(18.7)
(18.8)
(18.9)
(18.10)
Equations 18.7–18.10 reveal that the four z parameters can be described
as follows:
•
is the impedance seen looking into port 1 when port 2 is open.
•
is a transfer impedance. It is the ratio of the port 1 voltage to the
port 2 current when port 1 is open.
•
is a transfer impedance. It is the ratio of the port 2 voltage to the
port 1 current when port 2 is open.
•
is the impedance seen looking into port 2 when port 1 is open.
Therefore the impedance parameters may be either calculated or
measured by first opening port 2 and determining the ratios 
and
and then opening port 1 and determining the ratios 
and

tive circuit.

The circuit is purely resistive, so the s-domain cir-

Two-Port Circuits
Equations 18.7–18.10 and Example 18.1 show why the parameters in
Eqs. 18.1 are called the z parameters. Each parameter is the ratio of a volt-
age to a current and therefore is an impedance with the dimension of ohms.
We use the same process to determine the remaining port parameters,
which are either calculated or measured. A port parameter is obtained by
either opening or shorting a port. Moreover, a port parameter is an imped-
ance, an admittance, or a dimensionless ratio. The dimensionless ratio is
the ratio of either two voltages or two currents. Equations 18.11–18.15
summarize these observations.

that is either an impedance or an admittance. The a and b parameters are
called the transmission parameters because they describe the voltage and
current at one end of the two-port network in terms of the voltage and cur-
rent at the other end. The immittance and transmission parameters are the
natural choices for relating the port variables. In other words, they relate
either voltage to current variables or input to output variables. The h and 
g parameters relate cross-variables, that is, an input voltage and output cur-
rent to an output voltage and input current.Therefore the h and g parame-
ters are called hybrid parameters.
Example 18.2 illustrates how a set of measurements made at the ter-
minals of a two-port circuit can be used to calculate the a parameters.

same ammeter reading. Consider, for example, the resistive circuit shown
in Fig. 18.4.When a voltage source of 15 V is applied to port ad, it produces
a current of 1.75 A in the ammeter at port cd.The ammeter current is eas-
ily determined once we know the voltage 
Thus
(18.34)
and 
Therefore
(18.35)
If the voltage source and ammeter are interchanged, the ammeter will still
read 1.75 A.We verify this by solving the circuit shown in Fig. 18.5:
(18.36)
From Eq. 18.36,
The current 
equals
(18.37)
A two-port circuit is also reciprocal if the interchange of an ideal cur-
rent source at one port with an ideal voltmeter at the other port produces

calculations or measurements are needed to determine a set of parameters.
A reciprocal two-port circuit is symmetric if its ports can be inter-
changed without disturbing the values of the terminal currents and volt-
ages. Figure 18.6 shows four examples of symmetric two-port circuits. In
such circuits, the following additional relationships exist among the 
port parameters:

(18.39)
(18.40)

For a symmetric reciprocal network, only two calculations or meas-
urements are necessary to determine all the two-port parameters.

18.3 Analysis of the Terminated
Two-Port Circuit
In the typical application of a two-port model, the circuit is driven at port
1 and loaded at port 2. Figure 18.7 shows the s-domain circuit diagram for
a typically terminated two-port model. Here,
represents the internal
impedance of the source,
the internal voltage of the source, and 
the
load impedance. Analysis of this circuit involves expressing the terminal
currents and voltages as functions of the two-port parameters,
and 
Six characteristics of the terminated two-port circuit define its termi-
nal behavior:
•
the input impedance 
or the admittance 
•
the output current
•
the Thévenin voltage and impedance (
) with respect to port 2
•
the current gain 
•
the voltage gain
•
the voltage gain
The Six Characteristics in Terms of the z Parameters
To illustrate how these six characteristics are derived, we develop the
expressions using the z parameters to model the two-port portion of the
circuit. Table 18.2 summarizes the expressions involving the y, a, b, h, and
g parameters.
The derivation of any one of the desired expressions involves the
algebraic manipulation of the two-port equations along with the two con-
straint equations imposed by the terminations. If we use the z-parameter
equations, the four that describe the circuit in Fig. 18.7 are
(18.44)
(18.45)
(18.46)
(18.47)
Equations 18.46
and 18.47
describe the constraints imposed by 
the terminations.
To find the impedance seen looking into port 1, that is,
we
proceed as follows. In Eq. 18.45 we replace 
with 
and solve the
resulting expression for :

We then substitute this equation into Eq. 18.44 and solve for

We now substitute Eq. 18.50 into Eq. 18.48 and solve the resulting equa-

The Thévenin voltage with respect to port 2 equals 
when 
With

therefore substituting the
results into Eq. 18.52 yields the open-circuit value of

The Thévenin, or output, impedance is the ratio 
when 
is replaced
by a short circuit.When 
is zero, Eq. 18.46 reduces to
(18.54)
Substituting Eq. 18.54 into Eq. 18.44 gives

We now use Eq. 18.55 to replace 
in Eq. 18.45, with the result that

The current gain 
comes directly from Eq. 18.48:

18.4 Interconnected Two-Port Circuits
Synthesizing a large,complex system is usually made easier by first designing
subsections of the system. Interconnecting these simpler, easier-to-design
units then completes the system. If the subsections are modeled by two-port
circuits, synthesis involves the analysis of interconnected two-port circuits.
Two-port circuits may be interconnected five ways: (1) in cascade,
(2) in series, (3) in parallel, (4) in series-parallel, and (5) in parallel-series.
Figure 18.9 depicts these five basic interconnections.
We analyze and illustrate only the cascade connection in this section.
However, if the four other connections meet certain requirements, we can
obtain the parameters that describe the interconnected circuits by simply
adding the individual network parameters. In particular, the z parameters
describe the series connection, the y parameters the parallel connection,
the h parameters the series-parallel connection, and the g parameters the
parallel-series connection.1
The cascade connection is important because it occurs frequently in
the modeling of large systems. Unlike the other four basic interconnec-
tions, there are no restrictions on using the parameters of the individual
two-port circuits to obtain the parameters of the interconnected circuits.
The a parameters are best suited for describing the cascade connection.
We analyze the cascade connection by using the circuit shown in
Fig. 18.10, where a single prime denotes a parameters in the first circuit
and a double prime denotes a parameters in the second circuit.The output

1966), ch. 4.

Analyzing Cascaded Two-Port Circuits
Two identical amplifiers are connected in cas-
cade, as shown in Fig. 18.11. Each amplifier is
described in terms of its h parameters. The values

Find the voltage gain

Solution
The first step in finding 
is to convert from 
h parameters to a parameters. The amplifiers are
identical, so one set of a parameters describes 
the amplifiers:
Next we use Eqs. 18.74–18.77 to compute the 
a parameters of the cascaded amplifiers:

If more than two units are connected in cascade, the a parameters of
the equivalent two-port circuit can be found by successively reducing the
original set of two-port circuits one pair at a time.
Example 18.5 illustrates how to use Eqs. 18.74–18.77 to analyze a cas-
cade connection with two amplifier circuits.

Practical Perspective
Characterizing an Unknown Circuit
We make the following measurements to find the h parameters for our "black
box" amplifier:
With Port 1 open, apply 50 V at Port 2. Measure the voltage at Port 1
and the current at Port 2:
.
With Port 2 short-circuited, apply 2.5 mA at Port 1. Measure the volt-
age at Port 1 and the current at Port 2:
.
Calculate the h parameters according to Eq. 18.14:
;
.
Now we use the terminated two-port equations to determine whether or not
it is safe to attach a 2 V(rms) source with a 100 
internal impedance to
Port 1 and use this source together with the amplifier to drive a speaker
modeled as a 32 
resistance with a power rating of 100 W. Here we find
the value of  
from Table 18.2:
Calculate the power to the 32 
speaker:
The amplifier would thus deliver 126 W to the speaker, which is rated at 
100 W, so it would be better to use a different amplifier or buy a more pow-
erful speaker.

Two-Port Circuits
Summary
•
The two-port model is used to describe the performance
of a circuit in terms of the voltage and current at its
input and output ports. (See page 676.)
•
The model is limited to circuits in which
•
no independent sources are inside the circuit between
the ports;
•
no energy is stored inside the circuit between the ports;
•
the current into the port is equal to the current out of
the port; and
•
no external connections exist between the input and
output ports.
(See page 676.)
•
Two of the four terminal variables (
,
,
,
) are
independent; therefore, only two simultaneous equa-
tions involving the four variables are needed to describe
the circuit. (See page 678.)
•
The six possible sets of simultaneous equations involv-
ing the four terminal variables are called the z-, y-, a-, b-,
h-, and g-parameter equations. See Eqs. 18.1–18.6. (See
page 678.)
•
The parameter equations are written in the s domain.The
dc values of the parameters are obtained by setting 
and the sinusoidal steady-state values are obtained by
setting 
. (See page 678.)
s = jv
s = 0,
I2
V2
I1
V1
•
Any set of parameters may be calculated or measured by
invoking appropriate short-circuit and open-circuit con-
ditions at the input and output ports. See Eqs. 18.7–18.15.
(See pages 679 and 680.)
•
The relationships among the six sets of parameters are
given in Table 18.1. (See page 682.)
•
A two-port circuit is reciprocal if the interchange of an
ideal voltage source at one port with an ideal ammeter
at the other port produces the same ammeter reading.
The effect of reciprocity on the two-port parameters is
given by Eqs. 18.28–18.33. (See page 685.)
•
A reciprocal two-port circuit is symmetric if its ports
can be interchanged without disturbing the values of
the terminal currents and voltages. The added effect
of symmetry on the two-port parameters is given by
Eqs. 18.38–18.43. (See page 686)
•
The performance of a two-port circuit connected to a
Thévenin equivalent source and a load is summarized by
the relationships given in Table 18.2. (See page 688.)
•
Large networks can be divided into subnetworks by
means of interconnected two-port models. The cas-
cade connection was used in this chapter to illustrate
the analysis of interconnected two-port circuits. (See
page 692.)

Circuit analysis frequently involves the solution of linear simultaneous
equations. Our purpose here is to review the use of determinants to solve
such a set of equations.The theory of determinants (with applications) can
be found in most intermediate-level algebra texts. (A particularly good
reference for engineering students is Chapter 1 of E.A. Guillemin’s The
Mathematics of Circuit Analysis [New York: Wiley, 1949]. In our review
here, we will limit our discussion to the mechanics of solving simultaneous
equations with determinants.
A.1 Preliminary Steps
The first step in solving a set of simultaneous equations by determinants is
to write the equations in a rectangular (square) format. In other words, we
arrange the equations in a vertical stack such that each variable occupies
the same horizontal position in every equation. For example, in Eqs. A.1,
the variables 
,
, and 
occupy the first, second, and third position,
respectively, on the left-hand side of each equation:
(A.1)
Alternatively, one can describe this set of equations by saying that 
occupies the first column in the array,
the second column, and 
the
third column.
If one or more variables are missing from a given equation, they can
be inserted by simply making their coefficient zero. Thus Eqs. A.2 can be
“squared up” as shown by Eqs.A.3:
(A.2)
(A.3)
 7v1 + 0v2 + 2v3 = 5.
 0v1 + 4v2 + 3v3 = 16,
 2v1 - v2 + 0v3 = 4,
 7v1 + 2v3 = 5;
 4v2 + 3v3 = 16,
 2v1 - v2 = 4,

The Solution of Linear Simultaneous Equations
A.2 Cramer’s Method
The value of each unknown variable in the set of equations is expressed as
the ratio of two determinants. If we let N, with an appropriate subscript,
represent the numerator determinant and 
represent the denominator
determinant, then the kth unknown 
is
(A.4)
The denominator determinant 
is the same for every unknown variable
and is called the characteristic determinant of the set of equations. The
numerator determinant 
varies with each unknown. Equation A.4 is
referred to as Cramer’s method for solving simultaneous equations.
A.3 The Characteristic Determinant
Once we have organized the set of simultaneous equations into an
ordered array, as illustrated by Eqs. A.1 and A.3, it is a simple matter to
form the characteristic determinant. This determinant is the square array
made up from the coefficients of the unknown variables. For example, the
characteristic determinants of Eqs.A.1 and A.3 are
(A.5)
and
(A.6)
respectively.
A.4 The Numerator Determinant
The numerator determinant 
is formed from the characteristic determi-
nant by replacing the kth column in the characteristic determinant with
the column of values appearing on the right-hand side of the equations.
For example, the numerator determinants for evaluating ,
, and 
in
Eqs.A.1 are

A.5 The Evaluation of a Determinant
The value of a determinant is found by expanding it in terms of its minors.
The minor of any element in a determinant is the determinant that
remains after the row and column occupied by the element have been
deleted. For example, the minor of the element 6 in Eq.A.7 is
while the minor of the element 22 in Eq.A.7 is
The cofactor of an element is its minor multiplied by the sign-
controlling factor
where i and j denote the row and column, respectively, occupied by the
element.Thus the cofactor of the element 6 in Eq.A.7 is

and the cofactor of the element 22 is
The cofactor of an element is also referred to as its signed minor.
The sign-controlling factor 
will equal 
or 
depending on
whether 
is an even or odd integer.Thus the algebraic sign of a cofac-
tor alternates between 
and 
as we move along a row or column. For
a 3
determinant, the plus and minus signs form the checkerboard pat-
tern illustrated here:
A determinant can be expanded along any row or column. Thus the first
step in making an expansion is to select a row i or a column j. Once a row
or column has been selected, each element in that row or column is multi-
plied by its signed minor, or cofactor. The value of the determinant is the
sum of these products. As an example, let us evaluate the determinant in
Eq. A.5 by expanding it along its first column. Following the rules just
explained, we write the expansion as
(A.13)
The 
determinants in Eq. A.13 can also be expanded by minors.
The minor of an element in a 
determinant is a single element. It fol-
lows that the expansion reduces to multiplying the upper-left element by
the lower-right element and then subtracting from this product the product
of the lower-left element times the upper-right element. Using this obser-
vation, we evaluate Eq.A.13 to
(A.14)
Had we elected to expand the determinant along the second row of ele-
ments, we would have written

matrices. In what follows, we briefly review matrix notation, algebra, and
terminology.1

order m by n, or

number of columns.We always specify the rows first and the columns sec-
ond. The elements of the matrix—
—can be real numbers,
complex numbers, or functions. We denote a matrix with a boldface capi-
tal letter.
The array in Eq.A.21 is frequently abbreviated by writing
(A.22)
where 
is the element in the ith row and the jth column.
If 
, A is called a row matrix, that is,
(A.23)
If 
, A is called a column matrix, that is,
(A.24)
If 
, A is called a square matrix. For example, if 
, the
square 3 by 3 matrix is
(A.25)
Also note that we use brackets 
to denote a matrix, whereas we use
vertical lines 
to denote a determinant. It is important to know the differ-
ence.A matrix is a rectangular array of elements.A determinant is a func-
tion of a square array of elements. Thus if a matrix A is square, we can
define the determinant of A. For example, if

A.7 Matrix Algebra
The equality, addition, and subtraction of matrices apply only to matrices
of the same order. Two matrices are equal if, and only if, their correspon-
ding elements are equal. In other words,
if, and only if,
for
all i and j. For example, the two matrices in Eqs. A.26 and A.27 are equal

If A and B are of the same order, then

For example, if
(A.30)
and
(A.31)
then
(A.32)
The equation
(A.33)
implies
(A.34)
For the matrices in Eqs.A.30 and A.31, we would have
(A.35)
Matrices of the same order are said to be conformable for addition and
subtraction.
Multiplying a matrix by a scalar k is equivalent to multiplying each
element by the scalar. Thus 
if, and only if,
. It should be
noted that k may be real or complex. As an example, we will multiply the
matrix D in Eq.A.35 by 5.The result is
(A.36)
Matrix multiplication can be performed only if the number of
columns in the first matrix is equal to the number of rows in the second
matrix. In other words, the product AB requires the number of columns in
A to equal the number of rows in B.The order of the resulting matrix will

, where A is of order 
and B is of order 
, then 
will
be a matrix of order 
.When the number of columns in A equals the
number of rows in B, we say A is conformable to B for multiplication.
An element in 
is given by the formula
(A.37)
The formula given by Eq. A.37 is easy to use if one remembers that
matrix multiplication is a row-by-column operation. Hence to get the ith,
jth term in , each element in the ith row of A is multiplied by the corre-
sponding element in the jth column of B, and the resulting products are
summed.The following example illustrates the procedure.We are asked to
find the matrix 
when
(A.38)
and
(A.39)
First we note that 
will be a 
matrix and that each element in 
will require summing three products.
To find 
we multiply the corresponding elements in row 1 of matrix A
with the elements in column 1 of matrix B and then sum the products.We
can visualize this multiplication and summing process by extracting the
corresponding row and column from each matrix and then lining them up
element by element. So to find 
we have

It follows that

In general, matrix multiplication is not commutative, that is,
. As an example, consider the product 
for the matrices in
Eqs.A.38 and A.39.The matrix generated by this multiplication is of order
, and each term in the resulting matrix requires adding two products.
Therefore if 
, we have
(A.41)
Obviously,
.We leave you to verify the elements in Eq.A.41.
Matrix multiplication is associative and distributive.Thus
(A.42)
(A.43)
and
(A.44)
In Eqs.A.42,A.43, and A.44, we assume that the matrices are conformable
for addition and multiplication.
We have already noted that matrix multiplication is not commutative.
There are two other properties of multiplication in scalar algebra that do
not carry over to matrix algebra.
First, the matrix product 
does not imply either 
or
. (Note: A matrix is equal to zero when all its elements are zero.) For
example, if

Hence the product is zero, but neither A nor B is zero.
Second, the matrix equation 
does not imply 
. For
example, if
then
The transpose of a matrix is formed by interchanging the rows and
columns. For example, if
The transpose of the sum of two matrices is equal to the sum of the
transposes, that is,
(A.45)
The transpose of the product of two matrices is equal to the product
of the transposes taken in reverse order. In other words,
(A.46)
Equation A.46 can be extended to a product of any number of matri-
ces. For example,
(A.47)
If 
, the matrix is said to be symmetric. Only square matrices
can be symmetric.
A.8 Identity, Adjoint, and
Inverse Matrices
An identity matrix is a square matrix where

except those along the main diagonal, where they are equal to 1.Thus

are all identity matrices. Note that identity matrices are always square.We
will use the symbol 
for an identity matrix.
The adjoint of a matrix A of order 
is defined as
(A.48)
where 
is the cofactor of 
. (See Section A.5 for the definition of a
cofactor.) It follows from Eq. A.48 that one can think of finding the
adjoint of a square matrix as a two-step process. First construct a matrix
made up of the cofactors of A, and then transpose the matrix of cofactors.
As an example we will find the adjoint of the 
matrix
The cofactors of the elements in A are
The matrix of cofactors is
It follows that the adjoint of A is
One can check the arithmetic of finding the adjoint of a matrix by
using the theorem
(A.49)
Equation A.49 tells us that the adjoint of A times A equals the determi-
nant of A times the identity matrix, or for our example,

Therefore
A square matrix A has an inverse, denoted as 
, if
(A.50)
Equation A.50 tells us that a matrix either premultiplied or postmultiplied
by its inverse generates the identity matrix 
. For the inverse matrix to
exist, it is necessary that the determinant of A not equal zero. Only square
matrices have inverses, and the inverse is also square.
A formula for finding the inverse of a matrix is
(A.51)
The formula in Eq. A.51 becomes very cumbersome if A is of an order
larger than 3 by 3.2 Today the digital computer eliminates the drudgery
of having to find the inverse of a matrix in numerical applications of
matrix algebra.
It follows from Eq.A.51 that the inverse of the matrix A in the previ-

A.9 Partitioned Matrices
It is often convenient in matrix manipulations to partition a given matrix
into submatrices.The original algebraic operations are then carried out in
terms of the submatrices. In partitioning a matrix, the placement of the
partitions is completely arbitrary, with the one restriction that a partition
must dissect the entire matrix. In selecting the partitions, it is also neces-
sary to make sure the submatrices are conformable to the mathematical
operations in which they are involved.
For example, consider using submatrices to find the product
, where
and
Assume that we decide to partition B into two submatrices,
and 
; thus
Now since B has been partitioned into a two-row column matrix, A must be
partitioned into at least a two-column matrix; otherwise the multiplication
cannot be performed.The location of the vertical partitions of the A matrix
will depend on the definitions of 
and 
. For example, if
then 
must contain three columns, and 
must contain two columns.
Thus the partitioning shown in Eq. A.52 would be acceptable for execut-
ing the product AB:

The Solution of Linear Simultaneous Equations
If, on the other hand, we partition the B matrix so that
then 
must contain two columns, and 
must contain three columns.
In this case the partitioning shown in Eq.A.53 would be acceptable in exe-
cuting the product 
:
(A.53)
For purposes of discussion, we will focus on the partitioning given in
Eq. A.52 and leave you to verify that the partitioning in Eq. A.53 leads to
the same result.
From Eq.A.52 we can write
(A.54)
It follows from Eqs.A.52 and A.54 that

The A matrix could also be partitioned horizontally once the vertical
partitioning is made consistent with the multiplication operation. In this
simple problem, the horizontal partitions can be made at the discretion of

The Solution of Linear Simultaneous Equations
Use the matrix method to solve for the node volt-
ages 
and 
in Eqs. 4.5 and 4.6.
Solution
The first step is to rewrite Eqs. 4.5 and 4.6 in matrix
notation. Collecting the coefficients of 
and 
and at the same time shifting the constant terms to
the right-hand side of the equations gives us
(A.57)
It follows that in matrix notation, Eq.A.57 becomes
(A.58)
or
(A.59)
where
To find the elements of the 
matrix, we pre-
multiply both sides of Eq. A.59 by the inverse of
A; thus
(A.60)
Equation A.60 reduces to
(A.61)
or

To find the inverse of A, we first find the
cofactors of A. Thus

The matrix of cofactors is

The Solution of Linear Simultaneous Equations
Use the matrix method to find the phasor mesh cur-

the equation

The current controlling the dependent voltage
source is

After substituting Eq. A.81 into Eq. A.80, the
equations are put into a matrix format by first collect-
ing,in each equation,the coefficients of

analyze the cascade connection of two two-port circuits.
Show by means of matrix algebra how the input
variables

the output variables 
and 
in the cascade con-
nection shown in Fig. 18.10.

relationship between the input and output variables
of each two-port circuit.Thus

Complex numbers were invented to permit the extraction of the square roots
of negative numbers. Complex numbers simplify the solution of problems
that would otherwise be very difficult. The equation 
,
for example, has no solution in a number system that excludes complex
numbers.These numbers, and the ability to manipulate them algebraically,
are extremely useful in circuit analysis.
B.1 Notation
There are two ways to designate a complex number: with the cartesian, or
rectangular, form or with the polar, or trigonometric, form. In the
rectangular form, a complex number is written in terms of its real and
imaginary components; hence
(B.1)
where a is the real component, b is the imaginary component, and j is by
definition 
.1
In the polar form, a complex number is written in terms of its magni-
tude (or modulus) and angle (or argument); hence
(B.2)
where c is the magnitude,
is the angle, e is the base of the natural loga-
rithm, and, as before,
. In the literature, the symbol 
is fre-
quently used in place of

Because there are two ways of expressing the same complex number,
we need to relate one form to the other. The transition from the polar to

It is not obvious from Eq. B.7 in which quadrant the angle lies.The ambi-
guity can be resolved by a graphical representation of the complex number.
B.2 The Graphical Representation 
of a Complex Number
A complex number is represented graphically on a complex-number
plane, which uses the horizontal axis for plotting the real component and
the vertical axis for plotting the imaginary component. The angle of the
complex number is measured counterclockwise from the positive real axis.
The graphical plot of the complex number 
, if we
assume that a and b are both positive, is shown in Fig. B.1.
This plot makes very clear the relationship between the rectangular and
polar forms.Any point in the complex-number plane is uniquely defined by
giving either its distance from each axis (that is, a and b) or its radial dis-
tance from the origin (c) and the angle of the radial measurement .
It follows from Fig. B.1 that is in the first quadrant when a and b are
both positive, in the second quadrant when a is negative and b is positive,
in the third quadrant when a and b are both negative, and in the fourth
quadrant when a is positive and b is negative. These observations are
illustrated in Fig. B.2, where we have plotted 
,
,
,
and 
.
Note that we can also specify as a clockwise angle from the positive
real axis. Thus in Fig. B.2(c) we could also designate 
as
. In Fig. B.2(d) we observe that 
. It is
customary to express in terms of negative values when lies in the third
or fourth quadrant.
The graphical interpretation of a complex number also shows the
relationship between a complex number and its conjugate.The conjugate
of a complex number is formed by reversing the sign of its imaginary
component. Thus the conjugate of 
is 
, and the conjugate of
is 
. When we write a complex number in polar form, we
form its conjugate simply by reversing the sign of the angle . Therefore
the conjugate of 
is 
. The conjugate of a complex number is

B.3 Arithmetic Operations
Addition (Subtraction)
To add or subtract complex numbers, we must express the numbers in rec-
tangular form. Addition involves adding the real parts of the complex
numbers to form the real part of the sum, and the imaginary parts to form
the imaginary part of the sum.Thus, if we are given
and
then
Subtraction follows the same rule.Thus
If the numbers to be added or subtracted are given in polar form, they are
first converted to rectangular form. For example, if

Multiplication (Division)
Multiplication or division of complex numbers can be carried out with the
numbers written in either rectangular or polar form. However, in most
cases, the polar form is more convenient. As an example, let’s find the
product 
when 
and 
. Using the rectangular
form, we have
If we use the polar form, the multiplication 
becomes
The first step in dividing two complex numbers in rectangular form is to
multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denomi-
nator. This reduces the denominator to a real number. We then divide the
real number into the new numerator. As an example, let’s find the value of

C.1 Equivalent Circuits for Magnetically
Coupled Coils
At times, it is convenient to model magnetically coupled coils with an
equivalent circuit that does not involve magnetic coupling. Consider the
two magnetically coupled coils shown in Fig. C.1. The resistances 
and
represent the winding resistance of each coil.The goal is to replace the
magnetically coupled coils inside the shaded area with a set of inductors
that are not magnetically coupled. Before deriving the equivalent circuits,
we must point out an important restriction:The voltage between terminals
b and d must be zero. In other words, if terminals b and d can be shorted
together without disturbing the voltages and currents in the original cir-
cuit, the equivalent circuits derived in the material that follows can be
used to model the coils. This restriction is imposed because, while the
equivalent circuits we develop both have four terminals, two of those four
terminals are shorted together. Thus, the same requirement is placed on
the original circuits.
We begin developing the circuit models by writing the two equations
that relate the terminal voltages 
and 
to the terminal currents 
and
For the given references and polarity dots,

(C.2)
The T-Equivalent Circuit
To arrive at an equivalent circuit for these two magnetically coupled coils,
we seek an arrangement of inductors that can be described by a set of
equations equivalent to Eqs. C.1 and C.2. The key to finding the arrange-
ment is to regard Eqs. C.1 and C.2 as mesh-current equations with 
and 
as the mesh variables. Then we need one mesh with a total inductance of
H and a second mesh with a total inductance of 
H. Furthermore, the
two meshes must have a common inductance of M H. The T-arrangement
of coils shown in Fig. C.2 satisfies these requirements.

You should verify that the equations relating 
and 
to 
and 
reduce to Eqs. C.1 and C.2. Note the absence of magnetic coupling between
the inductors and the zero voltage between b and d.
The
-Equivalent Circuit
We can derive a 
-equivalent circuit for the magnetically coupled coils
shown in Fig. C.1. This derivation is based on solving Eqs. C.1 and C.2 for
the derivatives 
and 
and then regarding the resulting expres-
sions as a pair of node-voltage equations. Using Cramer’s method for solv-
ing simultaneous equations, we obtain expressions for 
and 
:
(C.3)
(C.4)
Now we solve for 
and 
by multiplying both sides of Eqs. C.3 and C.4 by
and then integrating:
(C.5)
and
(C.6)
If we regard 
and 
as node voltages, Eqs. C.5 and C.6 describe a circuit
of the form shown in Fig. C.3.
All that remains to be done in deriving the -equivalent circuit is to
find 
,
, and 
as functions of 
,
, and M.We easily do so by writ-
ing the equations for 
and 
in Fig. C.3 and then comparing them with

When we incorporate Eqs. C.9–C.11 into the circuit shown in Fig. C.3, the

as shown in Fig. C.4.
Note that the initial values of

are explicit in the -equivalent
circuit but implicit in the T-equivalent circuit.We are focusing on the sinu-
soidal steady-state behavior of circuits containing mutual inductance, so
we can assume that the initial values of

eliminate the current sources in the 
-equivalent circuit, and the circuit
shown in Fig. C.4 simplifies to the one shown in Fig. C.5.
The mutual inductance carries its own algebraic sign in the T- and

pled coils is reversed from that given in Fig. C.1, the algebraic sign of M

you are using the equivalent circuits in computations. However, if you
are to build the equivalent circuits with circuit components, the negative
inductors can be bothersome.The reason is that whenever the frequency
of the sinusoidal source changes, you must change the capacitor used to
simulate the negative reactance. For example, at a frequency of
a 
inductor has an impedance of 
. This imped-
ance can be modeled with a capacitor having a capacitance of

continuously, the use of a capacitor to simulate negative inductance is
practically worthless.
You can circumvent the problem of dealing with negative inductances
by introducing an ideal transformer into the equivalent circuit.This doesn’t
completely solve the modeling problem, because ideal transformers can
only be approximated. However, in some situations the approximation is
good enough to warrant a discussion of using an ideal transformer in the
T- and -equivalent circuits of magnetically coupled coils.
An ideal transformer can be used in two different ways in either the 
T-equivalent or the -equivalent circuit. Figure C.12 shows the two arrange-
ments for each type of equivalent circuit.
Verifying any of the equivalent circuits in Fig. C.12 requires showing
only that, for any circuit, the equations relating 
and 
to 
and
are identical to Eqs. C.1 and C.2. Here, we validate the circuit shown
in Fig. C.12(a); we leave it to you to verify the circuits in Figs. C.12(b), (c),
and (d). To aid the discussion, we redrew the circuit shown in Fig. C.12(a)
as Fig. C.13, adding the variables 
and

The Need for Ideal Transformers in the Equivalent Circuits

The ideal transformer imposes constraints on

(C.14)
(C.15)
Substituting Eqs. C.14 and C.15 into Eqs. C.12 and C.13 gives
(C.16)
and
(C.17)
From Eqs. C.16 and C.17,
(C.18)
and
(C.19)
Equations C.18 and C.19 are identical to Eqs. C.1 and C.2; thus, insofar as
terminal behavior is concerned, the circuit shown in Fig. C.13 is equivalent
to the magnetically coupled coils shown inside the box in Fig. C.1.
In showing that the circuit in Fig. C.13 is equivalent to the magneti-
cally coupled coils in Fig. C.1, we placed no restrictions on the turns
ratio a. Therefore, an infinite number of equivalent circuits are possible.
Furthermore, we can always find a turns ratio to make all the inductances
positive.Three values of a are of particular interest:
(C.20)
(C.21)
and
(C.22)
The value of a given by Eq. C.20 eliminates the inductances 
and 
from the T-equivalent circuits and the inductances
and 
from the
-equivalent 
circuits.

value 
of 
a

Eq.

eliminates the inductances

Also note that when

become identical, and when

become identical. Figures C.14 and C.15 summarize these observations.

In deriving the expressions for the inductances there, we used the
relationship 
. Expressing the inductances as functions of
the self-inductances 
and 
and the coefficient of coupling k allows the
values of a given by Eqs. C.20 and C.21 not only to reduce the number of
inductances needed in the equivalent circuit, but also to guarantee that all
the inductances will be positive. We leave to you to investigate the conse-
quences of choosing the value of a given by Eq. C.22.
The values of a given by Eqs. C.20–C.22 can be determined experi-
mentally.The ratio 
is obtained by driving the coil designated as hav-
ing 
turns by a sinusoidal voltage source. The source frequency is set
high enough that 
, and the 
coil is left open. Figure C.16
shows this arrangement.
With the 
coil open,
(C.23)
Now, as 
, the current 
is
(C.24)
Substituting Eq. C.24 into Eq. C.23 yields
(C.25)
in which the ratio 
is the terminal voltage ratio corresponding to
coil 2 being open; that is,
.
We obtain the ratio 
by reversing the procedure; that is, coil 2 is
energized and coil 1 is left open.Then
(C.26)
Finally, we observe that the value of a given by Eq. C.22 is the geo-
metric mean of these two voltage ratios; thus
(C.27)
For coils wound on nonmagnetic cores, the voltage ratio is not the
same as the turns ratio, as it very nearly is for coils wound on ferromagnetic
cores. Because the self-inductances vary as the square of the number of
turns, Eq. C.27 reveals that the turns ratio is approximately equal to the
geometric mean of the two voltage ratios, or

Telephone engineers who were concerned with the power loss across the
cascaded circuits used to transmit telephone signals introduced the deci-
bel. Figure D.1 defines the problem.
There,
is the power input to the system,
is the power output of
circuit A,
is the power output of circuit B, and 
is the power output
of the system.The power gain of each circuit is the ratio of the power out
to the power in. Thus
The overall power gain of the system is simply the product of the individ-
ual gains, or
The multiplication of power ratios is converted to addition by means of
the logarithm; that is,
This log ratio of the powers was named the bel, in honor of Alexander
Graham Bell. Thus we calculate the overall power gain, in bels, simply by
summing the power gains, also in bels, of each segment of the transmission
system. In practice, the bel is an inconveniently large quantity. One-tenth
of a bel is a more useful measure of power gain; hence the decibel. The
number of decibels equals 10 times the number of bels, so
When we use the decibel as a measure of power ratios, in some situa-
tions the resistance seen looking into the circuit equals the resistance
loading the circuit, as illustrated in Fig. D.2.
When the input resistance equals the load resistance, we can convert
the power ratio to either a voltage ratio or a current ratio:

The Decibel
These equations show that the number of decibels becomes
(D.1)
The definition of the decibel used in Bode diagrams (see Appendix E)
is borrowed from the results expressed by Eq. D.1, since these results
apply to any transfer function involving a voltage ratio, a current ratio, a
voltage-to-current ratio, or a current-to-voltage ratio.You should keep the
original definition of the decibel firmly in mind because it is of fundamen-
tal importance in many engineering applications.
When you are working with transfer function amplitudes expressed in
decibels, having a table that translates the decibel value to the actual value
of the output/input ratio is helpful. Table D.1 gives some useful pairs. The
ratio corresponding to a negative decibel value is the reciprocal of the pos-
itive ratio. For example,
corresponds to an output/input ratio of
, or 0.707. Interestingly,
corresponds to the half-power fre-
quencies of the filter circuits discussed in Chapters 14 and 15.
The decibel is also used as a unit of power when it expresses the ratio
of a known power to a reference power. Usually the reference power is
1 mW and the power unit is written dBm, which stands for “decibels rela-
tive to one milliwatt.” For example, a power of 20 mW corresponds to
AC voltmeters commonly provide dBm readings that assume not only
a 1 mW reference power but also a 
reference resistance (a value
commonly used in telephone systems). Since a power of 1 mW in 
corresponds to 0.7746 V (rms), that voltage is read as 0 dBm on the meter.
For analog meters, there usually is exactly a 10 dB difference between
adjacent ranges. Although the scales may be marked 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 10, and
so on, in fact 3.16 V on the 3 V scale lines up with 1 V on the 1 V scale.
Some voltmeters provide a switch to choose a reference resistance (50,
135, 600, or 
) or to select dBm or dBV (decibels relative to one volt).

As we have seen, the frequency response plot is a very important tool for
analyzing a circuit’s behavior. Up to this point, however, we have shown
qualitative sketches of the frequency response without discussing how to
create such diagrams. The most efficient method for generating and plot-
ting the amplitude and phase data is to use a digital computer; we can rely
on it to give us accurate numerical plots of 
and 
versus .
However, in some situations, preliminary sketches using Bode diagrams
can help ensure the intelligent use of the computer.
A Bode diagram, or plot, is a graphical technique that gives a feel
for the frequency response of a circuit. These diagrams are named in
recognition of the pioneering work done by H.W. Bode.1 They are most
useful for circuits in which the poles and zeros of 
are reasonably
well separated.
Like the qualitative frequency response plots seen thus far, a Bode
diagram consists of two separate plots: One shows how the amplitude of
varies with frequency, and the other shows how the phase angle 
of 
varies with frequency. In Bode diagrams, the plots are made on
semilog graph paper for greater accuracy in representing the wide range
of frequency values. In both the amplitude and phase plots, the frequency
is plotted on the horizontal log scale, and the amplitude and phase angle
are plotted on the linear vertical scale.
E.1 Real, First-Order Poles and Zeros
To simplify the development of Bode diagrams, we begin by considering
only cases where all the poles and zeros of 
are real and first order.
Later we will present cases with complex and repeated poles and zeros.
For our purposes, having a specific expression for 
is helpful. Hence
we base the discussion on

The first step in making Bode diagrams is to put the expression for
in a standard form, which we derive simply by dividing out the
poles and zeros:

The amplitude plot involves the multiplication and division of factors
associated with the poles and zeros of

and division to addition and subtraction by expressing the amplitude of
in terms of a logarithmic value: the decibel (dB).2 The amplitude 
of

between the actual value of several amplitudes and their values in deci-

Straight-Line Amplitude Plots

The key to plotting Eq. E.10 is to plot each term in the equation sepa-
rately and then combine the separate plots graphically.The individual fac-
tors are easy to plot because they can be approximated in all cases by
straight lines.
The plot of 
is a horizontal straight line because 
is not a
function of frequency. The value of this term is positive for 
, zero
for 
, and negative for 
.
Two straight lines approximate the plot of

values of , the magnitude 
is approximately 1, and therefore

For large values of

On a log frequency scale,

(a decade is a 10-to-1 change in frequency). This straight
line intersects the 0 dB axis at 
. This value of 
is called the
corner frequency. Thus, on the basis of Eqs. E.11 and E.12, two straight
lines can approximate the amplitude plot of a first-order zero, as

E.3 More Accurate Amplitude Plots
We can make the straight-line plots for first-order poles and zeros more
accurate by correcting the amplitude values at the corner frequency, one
half the corner frequency, and twice the corner frequency. At the corner
frequency, the actual value in decibels is
(E.13)
The actual value at one half the corner frequency is
(E.14)
At twice the corner frequency, the actual value in decibels is
(E.15)
In Eqs. E.13–E.15, the plus sign applies to a first-order zero, and the minus
sign applies to a first-order pole. The straight-line approximation of the
amplitude plot gives 0 dB at the corner and one half the corner frequencies,
and 
at twice the corner frequency. Hence the corrections are 
at the corner frequency and 
at both one half the corner frequency
and twice the corner frequency. Figure E.6 summarizes these corrections.
A 2-to-1 change in frequency is called an octave. A slope of
is equivalent to 
which for graphical pur-
poses is equivalent to 
Thus the corrections enumerated cor-
respond to one octave below and one octave above the corner frequency.

Straight-Line Phase Angle Plots

If the poles and zeros of 
are well separated, inserting these
corrections into the overall amplitude plot and achieving a reasonably
accurate curve is relatively easy. However, if the poles and zeros are
close together, the overlapping corrections are difficult to evaluate, and
you’re better off using the straight-line plot as a first estimate of the
amplitude characteristic. Then use a computer to refine the calculations
in the frequency range of interest.
E.4 Straight-Line Phase Angle Plots
We can also make phase angle plots by using straight-line approximations.
The phase angle associated with the constant 
is zero, and the phase
angle associated with a first-order zero or pole at the origin is a constant
. For a first-order zero or pole not at the origin, the straight-line
approximations are as follows:
•
For frequencies less than one tenth the corner frequency, the phase
angle is assumed to be zero.
•
For frequencies greater than 10 times the corner frequency, the phase
angle is assumed to be 
.
•
Between one tenth the corner frequency and 10 times the corner fre-
quency, the phase angle plot is a straight line that goes through 
at
one-tenth the corner frequency,
at the corner frequency, and
at 10 times the corner frequency.
In all these cases, the plus sign applies to the first-order zero and the minus
sign to the first-order pole. Figure E.7 depicts the straight-line approxima-
tion for a first-order zero and pole.The dashed curves show the exact vari-
ation of the phase angle as the frequency varies. Note how closely the

Bode Diagrams
The complex poles and zeros of 
always appear in conjugate
pairs.The first step in making either an amplitude or a phase angle plot of
a transfer function that contains complex poles is to combine the conju-
gate pair into a single quadratic term.Thus, for
(E.16)
we first rewrite the product 
as
(E.17)
When making Bode diagrams, we write the quadratic term in a more con-
venient form:
(E.18)
A direct comparison of the two forms shows that
(E.19)
and
(E.20)
The term 
is the corner frequency of the quadratic factor, and 
is the
damping coefficient of the quadratic term. The critical value of 
is 1. If
, the roots of the quadratic factor are complex, and we use Eq. E.18
to represent the complex poles. If 
, we factor the quadratic factor
into 
and then plot amplitude and phase in accordance
with the discussion previously.Assuming that 
, we rewrite Eq. E.16 as
(E.21)
We then write Eq. E.21 in standard form by dividing through by the poles
and zeros. For the quadratic term, we divide through by 
, so

Before discussing the amplitude and phase angle diagrams associated
with Eq. E.23, for convenience we replace the ratio 
by a new vari-
able, u.Then

E.7 Correcting Straight-Line 
Amplitude Plots
Correcting the straight-line amplitude plot for a pair of complex poles
is not as easy as correcting a first-order real pole, because the correc-
tions depend on the damping coefficient . Figure E.11 shows the
effect of 
on the amplitude plot. Note that as 
becomes very small, a
large peak in the amplitude occurs in the neighborhood of the corner
frequency 
. When 
, the corrected amplitude plot
lies entirely below the straight-line approximation. For sketching pur-
poses, the straight-line amplitude plot can be corrected by locating
four points on the actual curve. These four points correspond to
(1) one half the corner frequency, (2) the frequency at which the ampli-
tude reaches its peak value, (3) the corner frequency, and (4) the fre-
quency at which the amplitude is zero. Figure E.12 shows these
four points.
At one half the corner frequency (point 1), the actual amplitude is
(E.31)
The amplitude peaks (point 2) at a frequency of
(E.32)
and it has a peak amplitude of
(E.33)
At the corner frequency (point 3), the actual amplitude is
(E.34)
The corrected amplitude plot crosses the 0 dB axis (point 4) at
(E.35)
The derivations of Eqs. E.31, E.34, and E.35 follow from Eq. E.28.
Evaluating Eq. E.28 at 
and 
, respectively, yields Eqs. E.31
and E.34 Equation E.35 corresponds to finding the value of u that makes
. The derivation of Eq. E.32 requires differen-
tiating Eq. E.28 with respect to u and then finding the value of u where the
derivative is zero. Equation E.33 is the evaluation of Eq. E.28 at the value
of u found in Eq. E.32.

a pair of complex poles.

Phase Angle Plots

E.8 Phase Angle Plots
The phase angle plot for a pair of complex poles is a plot of Eq. E.27. The
phase angle is zero at zero frequency and is 
at the corner frequency.
It approaches 
as 
becomes large. As in the case of the ampli-
tude plot,
is important in determining the exact shape of the phase angle
plot. For small values of , the phase angle changes rapidly in the vicinity
of the corner frequency. Figure E.15 shows the effect of 
on the phase
angle plot.
We can also make a straight-line approximation of the phase angle plot
for a pair of complex poles.We do so by drawing a line tangent to the phase
angle curve at the corner frequency and extending this line until it inter-
sects with the 
and 
lines.The line tangent to the phase angle curve
at 
has a slope of 
and it
intersects the 
and 
lines at 
and 
, respec-
tively. Figure E.16 depicts the straight-line approximation for 
and
shows the actual phase angle plot. Comparing the straight-line approxima-
tion to the actual curve indicates that the approximation is reasonable in
the vicinity of the corner frequency. However, in the neighborhood of 
and 
, the error is quite large. In Example E.4, we summarize our discus-
sion of Bode diagrams.

Solution
a) Transform the circuit in Fig. E.17 to the s-domain
and then perform s-domain voltage division to get
Substituting the component values from the cir-
cuit gives
b) The first step in making Bode diagrams is to put
in standard form. Because 
contains
a quadratic factor, we first check the value of .
We find that

Then,
Solving for 
gives us
e) Figure E.19 shows the phase angle plot. Note
that the straight-line segment of 
between
1.0 and 
does not have the same slope as
the segment between 2.5 and 
.
f) From the phase angle plot in Fig. E.19, we esti-
mate the phase angle at the cutoff frequency of
to be 
.
g) We can compute the exact phase angle at the
cutoff frequency by substituting 
into the
transfer function 
:

Computing the phase angle, we see
Note the large error in the predicted angle. In
general, straight-line phase angle plots do not
give satisfactory results in the frequency band
where the phase angle is changing. The straight-
line phase angle plot is useful only in predicting
the general behavior of the phase angle, not in
estimating actual phase angle values at particu-
lar frequencies.
