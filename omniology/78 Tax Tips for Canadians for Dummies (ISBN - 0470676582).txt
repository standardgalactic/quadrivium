Introduction
O
kay, we know what you’re thinking. This is a tax book. How 
fun a read can it be? How can it possibly keep my attention? 
How will I ever get through enough of this tome to learn how to do 
my own tax planning, plus what I need to prepare my tax return 
accurately and on time? We’re pretty good mind readers, aren’t we? 
But you’re right on only one account: This is a tax book. You’ll be 
pleasantly surprised, though (amazed and astounded, really), to find 
that this book does hold your attention, and you don’t have to pore 
over it from start to finish to get out of it what you need to pay less 
tax. As for the fun part, well . . . we promise this will be more fun 
than a root canal!
About This Book
Excuse us while we give ourselves a collective pat on the back, but 
we really couldn’t have assembled a better team of authors to put 
this book together. Each author is a chartered accountant and cer-
tified financial planner with considerable expertise in tax matters. 
Our combined years of experience span more decades than even 
an accountant can count. Trust us, at the hourly rates we charge, 
this book is a deal — just a few cents per tip! (To be honest, we’ve 
slipped in even more than 78 tips, but we figured you wouldn’t 
mind getting a few extra.) The bottom line? You can’t beat the 
advice you get in this book, and the value is outstanding.
We’ve been writing For Dummies tax books since 2000. But you’ll 
find this version quite different. This book is really a set of tips, 
with each part geared toward different kinds of taxpayers. You’ll 
find these tips come in handy throughout the year, not just come 
tax-filing time. For example, maybe you just had a new baby and 
are wondering what types of tax relief you might have, or how to 
save tax-effectively for your child’s education. Well, you can jump 
right to Part IV, Tips for Families, to get lots of great tips. Or maybe 
you want to get a head start on estate planning. Part V, Tips for 
Special Tax Planning Circumstances, is for you. But you’ll also find 
the book comes in extra handy during tax-filing time, when you can 
be sure you’re aware of all the deductions and credits you’re eli-
gible for. Talk about useful!
How This Book Is Organized
78 Tax Tips For Canadians For Dummies is organized into six 
distinct parts, each covering a different set of tax concerns.

78 Tax Tips For Canadians For Dummies   
2
Part I: Tips for Everyone
This part offers tax advice that applies to just about everyone. We 
help you understand Canada’s tax system, including our tax rates 
and our provincial/territorial tax systems, too. We also talk about 
how to organize your receipts and other tax information, and the 
various ways to file your return (no, it’s not good enough to simply 
stuff your receipts in an envelope and mail them to the tax collec-
tor!). Additionally, we look at one tax-reducing strategy that every-
one can do: donating to charity. Finally, we cover what happens 
after you file your return, and offer some hints on how to deal with 
disagreements with the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA).
Part II: Tips for Employees and 
Business Owners
If you’re part of the working world, you definitely want to read this 
part. Whether you work for yourself or someone else, you need 
to know what income and benefits are taxable and what types of 
deductions and credits you can claim. This can make a huge dif-
ference in how much tax you pay each year. For those of you who 
are out of work or looking for a new job, we have tips for you too, 
including what to do with severance pay, negotiating non-taxable 
benefits from your employer, and deducting moving costs if you 
have to move to find work. No matter what your situation, a thor-
ough read of Part II is a must for anyone working for a living!
Part III: Tips for Investors
Investors come in many shapes and sizes. Some are working away, 
and saving for the day they can retire. Some are already retired, 
and living off their savings. For some work is a hobby, for others 
it’s a chore. Some investors are conservative, others aggressive. 
Some like stocks, some like property.
Wherever you fit in, one thing’s for sure. Taxes make a difference. 
If you’re an investor of any kind, be sure to read this part, chock 
full of tips for your situation. We explore how to use RRSPs and 
TFSAs to your best advantage, how to invest tax-efficiently, how 
to minimize the tax on capital gains or make the most of capital 
losses, and more!

Part IV: Tips for Families
A whole part just for families? Yes! Here you find which deductions

friends will likely have some tips of their own). We also offer a 
tonne of income splitting tips to help your family tax plan to pay 
less tax — together! Finally, we offer tips for families that include 
students, whether they’re kids heading off to school for the first 
time, or adults hitting the books once more to freshen up their 
skills.
Part V: Tips for Special Tax-Planning 
Circumstances
We admit that this part’s name is a bit mysterious. But what else 
could we call a part that covers tips for donating to charity, medi-
cal expenses, pension income, estate planning, and more! (Really, 
what else? We’re open to suggestions.) Get out the sticky notes; 
this part is sure to be well used throughout the year.

Understand the Essentials
W
e get it. Most Canadians aren’t tax geeks like us. We under-
stand that tax is not known to be the most exciting of sub-
jects. But if you don’t care about your money, who will? Having a 
basic understanding of the Canadian tax system is an imperative 
first step to ensure you don’t pay more tax than you should. So, 
that being said, congratulations on taking this step to know more 
about taxes! We promise it won’t be too painful.
Though it can be confusing at times, Canada’s income tax system 
has two very straightforward purposes. The first is to finance gov-
ernment expenditures. The second is to encourage Canadians to 
make certain expenditures. That’s right — our government cuts 
you a tax break when you spend money in ways it approves of. For 
example, the government wants to encourage you to:
 
✓ Pursue post-secondary education. Tuition fees, textbooks, 
and interest incurred on student loans are eligible for a tax 
credit. Even better, scholarships, fellowships, and bursaries 
are completely tax free!
 
✓ Work. If you hire someone to look after your kids so you can 
work, you can deduct childcare expenses. And all employees 
are eligible for a Canada employment credit — the govern-
ment’s way of recognizing that we all incur some out-of-pocket 
expenses in order to work.
 
✓ Save for retirement. Tax rules are favourable for registered 
retirement savings plans (RRSPs).
 
✓ Invest. Dividends from Canadian corporations are taxed at a 
favourable rate, and only one-half of the capital gain on a sale 
of investments is subject to tax.
You’re probably beginning to realize that you spend money every 
year on items you can use to reduce your taxes. And every little bit 
counts! With this in mind, in this tip we guide you through the nitty 
gritty of the Canadian tax system.

Part I: Tips for Everyone

Understanding Where the 
Numbers Come From
If you live in Canada it’s pretty easy to figure out what gets 
included in your total income. Why? Well, to keep things simple, 
the Canadian government requires you to include all of your world-
wide income earned in a calendar year on your tax return. If you 
earned income, you can pretty much count on the fact that it’s 
taxable. Of course some exceptions do exist, and we discuss these 
throughout this book.
The next step is to claim any deductions you’re entitled to. Net 
income is the amount you arrive at when you subtract these deduc-
tions from your total income. You might think this net income 
figure is the amount on which you should pay tax. Well, no. The 
amount you pay tax on is your taxable income.
Determining what makes 
up taxable income
Here in Canada our income taxes are based on the amount of tax-
able income we earn in a year. Both the federal and provincial/
territorial governments levy income taxes on your taxable income 
(we talk more about these taxes in Tip #2). Your base amount of 
tax owing is reduced by any tax credits available to you, and the 
net amount is your tax bill for the year. It stands to reason that 
if you can keep your taxable income to a minimum and your tax 
credits as high as possible, you will pay less tax. And with tax rates 
reaching as high as about 50 percent for some Canadians, this can 
mean a lot more money stays in your wallet.
Even though taxes are not based on net income, it’s still an essen-
tial calculation that’s used to calculate your entitlement to certain 
tax credits and programs — like the provincial/territorial tax 
credit (Tip #3), the GST/HST credit (Tip #23), the Canada Child Tax 
Benefit (Tip #49), and credits for charitable donations (Tip #9), 
medical expenses (Tip #59), and social benefits (Tip #64).
Taxable income has a different focus altogether. The types of 
deductions allowed under the taxable income category are not 
necessarily related to current-year activities. For instance, the cal-
culation of taxable income includes deductions for prior-year losses. 
In fact, some of the deductions are permissive, meaning they allow 
for tax deductions based on your personal situation. For example, 
deductions are available for employee stock options, for residents

in northern areas of Canada, and for certain non-taxable payments 
received in the year.
 
On many returns, net income and taxable income will be the same; 
therefore, you won’t have to worry about these deductions at all. 
However, if you do have additional deductions, it’s important to 
keep in mind that a difference exists between net income and tax-
able income — be sure to use the right figures in the right places!
 
Sometimes you will have so many deductions to claim you won’t 
need them all to reduce your taxable income to the point where 
no taxes are owing. Use your available tax deductions to reduce 
your taxable income only to the point that it equals your total tax 
credits for the year. If you reduce your taxable income to zero, 
you won’t owe any taxes, but you might be wasting some deduc-
tions. For example, most taxpayers are allowed to claim the basic 
personal credit amount — this means you would want to report at 
least that much income (about $10,000, but the amount changes 
yearly). To optimize your tax situation, you therefore don’t want to 
waste tax deductions that you can carry forward to future years if 
it means reducing your taxable income below the amount of your 
tax credits. Zero taxable income is not the goal.
Tallying up your effective tax rate
Your effective tax rate is the percentage your tax is of your total 
taxable income. It’s easy to calculate — it’s simply your tax liability 
(after you’ve taken all the tax credits you’re entitled to) over your 
taxable income:
Tax liability
Taxable income =  Effective tax rate
Take a look at some figures from Micha’s tax return. She lives in 
Thompson, Manitoba, and her taxable income is $53,000. She cal-
culates the tax on the $53,000 and then reduces the amount for 
any tax credits she is entitled to. After these credits are deducted, 
her federal/Manitoba tax liability is $12,885. Her effective tax rate, 
then, is 24.3 percent ($12,885/$53,000).
The calculation of your effective tax rate takes into account that 
portions of your income are taxed in different tax brackets. The 
effective tax rate calculation “averages” the rates of tax paid in 
these brackets. The more income you have taxed in the highest tax 
bracket, the higher your effective tax rate.

Calculating your marginal tax rate
When tax geeks talk about marginal tax rates, we are referring to 
the tax rate that applies to your next dollar of taxable income.
Assume your taxable income is $130,000 and you are taxed in the 
top tax bracket. Further, assume you live in Alberta and that the 
highest tax rate is 39 percent. If you were to earn $1 of additional 
interest income, you would pay 39¢ in tax on this dollar. In other 
words, your marginal tax rate is 39 percent. On an after-tax basis, 
that extra dollar of income leaves you with only 61¢, or 61 percent. 
This is referred to as your after-tax rate of return. It can be calcu-
lated as:
1 – Your marginal tax rate = Your after-tax rate of return
The calculation of your marginal tax rate ignores that portions 
of your income are taxed in different tax brackets and subject to 
different tax rates. The marginal tax rate is focused on your next 
dollar of taxable income — not your overall taxable income.
The marginal tax rate is an easy way to assess the impact of a 
raise. With a marginal tax rate of 39 percent, you know that if you 
receive a $10,000 raise you will be taking home only an additional 
$6,100. When looking at investment returns from alternative invest-
ment opportunities, ensure you compare after-tax rates of return.
A marginal tax rate can also be used to calculate the tax savings 
that a deduction will provide. Again assume your taxable income 
is $130,000 and you live in Alberta. You are wondering what the 
impact would have been if you had contributed $5,000 to your 
RRSP and taken a deduction on your tax return. Your taxable 
income would have been reduced to $125,000 by the $5,000 RRSP 
deduction. You know your marginal tax rate on that $5,000 would 
have been 39 percent. The tax saving you would enjoy if you were 
able to deduct the $5,000 RRSP contribution is $1,950 ($5,000 multi-
plied by 39 percent)!
Knowing You Have the 
Right to Pay Less Tax
Canada’s tax system is based on self-assessment. Each of us is 
responsible to ensure our tax return includes all necessary infor-
mation for reporting income, claiming tax deductions and tax 

 # 1: Understand the Essentials 11
credits, and, finally, calculating our tax liability. In complying with 
the tax laws, we all have the right to pay as little tax as is legally 
possible. We stress legally.
Tax evasion occurs when you purposely understate the amount of 
income tax you should pay. This can occur when you don’t report 
all your income, or when you overstate tax deductions and credits. 
At worst, tax evasion can result in a charge being laid under the 
Criminal Code.
Tax planning is a continuous process. With the ever-changing 
economy and tax legislation, and the investment vehicles available 
in the market, you can always be planning ways to minimize your 
taxes. Many opportunities for tax planning arise when you experi-
ence a significant change in your life.
Reducing Your Tax Bill 
with Tax Credits
Tax credits directly reduce the amount of income tax you owe — 
they do not reduce your taxable income. In this way they differ 
from tax deductions, which are subtracted in computing your tax-
able income. 
Two kinds of credits are available: refundable and non-refundable. 
When a credit is referred to as non-refundable, it means that if 
it exceeds your tax you do not get a refund of the excess. Every 
Canadian is entitled to at least a basic personal credit (non-refund-
able) worth over $10,000, although this amount increases each 
year. This means you can earn at least $10,000 without paying any 
tax because the credit essentially wipes out the tax (see Tip #44).
Report all of your federal tax credits on schedule 1 of your tax 
return. Each province/territory also calculates its own tax cred-
its to help offset provincial/territorial taxes. These credits are 
reported on your provincial/territorial tax calculation forms. It’s a 
good idea to take a peek at these forms to see whether any of the 
credits sound like they might apply to your situation.

Understand the Different 
Types of Taxes
N
o doubt about it, Canada is a high-tax nation — which gives 
you all the more reason to minimize the taxes you pay. In 
this book we’re primarily concerned with income taxes, but many 
different types of taxes might apply to your situation. It’s your 
responsibility to understand what taxes you’re accountable for 
and to ensure you’re filing the proper returns.
A Tale of Two Income Taxes
Canada’s constitution gives income taxing powers to both the fed-
eral and the provincial/territorial governments, which does make 
things a little more confusing. But on the bright side, individu-
als need to deal with only one tax collector — the CRA. The CRA 
administers the tax system for the federal government and all of 
the provinces and territories except Quebec.
Both the feds and the provinces/territories have “tax on income” 
systems: taxes are based on taxable income, and each province 
and territory has the right to set its own rates and policies.
When you file your tax return, you fill out federal tax forms and 
provincial/territorial tax forms. The rules are similar, but not 
identical, for both. And when it comes time to file your return, you 
send your whole tax package to the CRA (unless you file in Quebec, 
in which case your federal return goes to the CRA and your provin-
cial return to the Ministère du Revenu du Québec).
Figuring out your federal taxes
Canada’s income tax system is a progressive tax rate system, which 
means that the percentage of your income that goes to fund your 
tax liability increases as your income increases. Take a look at the 
four federal tax brackets for 2009 shown in Table 1-1. These brack-
ets are set to increase to inflation annually; therefore, in years after 

 #2: Understand the Different Types of Taxes 13
2009, each bracket will cover an additional amount of income. You 
can find current-year rates on the CRA Web site, or on the Web 
sites of major accounting firms (see Tip #8).

As you can see, the greater your taxable income, the greater the 
percentage of tax applied to that additional income.
The tax rates in Table 1-1 are only the federal tax rates, and do 
not include provincial/territorial income taxes. When your taxable 
income falls into the top federal tax bracket (that is, greater than 
$126,265), your combined federal and provincial/territorial tax rate 
on the portion of your taxable income in the top tax bracket can be 
as high as the tax rates summarized in Table 1-2. However, the tax 
rates shown are before any tax credits (except the basic personal 
amount) that may be available to individuals. Your tax liability is 
based on your taxable income. After the liability is calculated, it’s 
reduced by tax credits available to you.
Taking a look at provincial 
and territorial taxes
In additional to federal taxes, every province/territory in Canada 
levies taxes based on taxable income. Table 1-2 indicates the total 
tax rates you would pay if you were taxed at the highest rates in 
each province/territory. Note that different highest rates apply 
depending on the type of income you earn. Regular income such as 
salaries and interest income (among others such as foreign income 
and rental income) are taxed the highest. Capital gains are only 
one-half taxable; therefore, the tax rate on capital gains is always 
exactly half that of regular income. And Canadian dividends are 
taxed at lower rates as well, due to a dividend tax credit.

Note: Figures are current to September 2009.
You probably noticed that two different tax rates apply to divi-
dends. The actual rate that will apply depends on their source. 
Non-eligible dividends are generally dividends paid from small 
businesses in Canada. If you own your own company and receive 
dividends from it, these rates likely apply to you. Alternatively, eli-
gible dividends are those paid by public corporations resident in 
Canada. It’s these eligible dividends that most investors in Canada 
receive when they invest in a non-registered account.

 #2: Understand the Different Types of Taxes 15
GST/HST
The Goods and Services Tax/Harmonized Sales Tax is not an 
income tax, but rather a consumer tax. But you already know that; 
when you make a purchase of goods or services in Canada you 
usually find this tax added onto your final bill.
GST/HST also finds its way into our income tax system in many 
ways. If you run a business, you’re generally required to charge 
GST on the goods and services you sell. You must remit the tax to 
the CRA, just like you remit income tax. Any GST/HST you pay on 
goods and services used in your business can be used to offset the 
GST/HST payable.
If you’re an employee, you might pay GST/HST on expenditures 
you have made for business purposes. The expenses you incur 
might be eligible for a tax deduction. And the GST/HST paid on 
those expenses is eligible for a rebate. You claim the rebate when 
you file your income tax return; see Tip #23 for details.
Finally, the government offers GST/HST rebates to taxpayers who 
meet the criteria. All you have to do is tick the box on your income 
tax return stating that you would like to apply. The CRA does the 
calculations, and if you qualify the CRA will send you quarterly 
non-taxable payments. What could be easier!
Alternative Minimum Tax
What is alternative minimum tax, you ask? Alternative minimum tax 
(AMT) is designed to prevent taxpayers with significant tax deduc-
tions from skipping off without paying some tax — a minimum tax, 
at least.
Minimum tax is not something the average taxpayer will ever have 
to worry about. But if you have some less than common tax deduc-
tions, take a look at form T691. The types of deductions listed 
on T691 that may lead you to pay minimum tax are not everyday 
types of deductions but include:
 
✓ Limited-partnership losses including carrying charges related 
to the limited partnership units
 
✓ Resource expenses, depletion allowances, and carrying 
charges related to resource properties and flow-through 
shares. You would have these deductions if you purchased 
certain tax shelter investments

Part I: Tips for Everyone  
16
 
✓ Stock option and share deductions if your employer offers 
stock options and you chose to exercise those options
 
✓ The non-taxable portion of capital gains (50 percent of gains) 
reported in the year. This includes any capital gain on which the 
capital gains exemption is claimed. Capital gains occur when you 
sell an asset, like a stock, for more than you paid for it.
 
✓ Employee home relocation loan deduction if your employer 
loaned you funds at a low interest rate to help you pay 
for a move
If you owe AMT, don’t fret. You can use that minimum tax to offset 
regular taxes payable in any of the next seven years. Assuming you 
pay regular tax during those years, you will get your money back. 
Consider it a prepayment of your future tax bill. Minimum tax is 
often more of a cash-flow issue than a true income tax.
International Taxes
Canada levies income taxes based on residency. If you are a resi-
dent of Canada, you’re liable for tax on your worldwide income 
(see Tip #31). In addition, Canada has a right to tax Canadian-
source income, even if you’re not resident here. For example, if 
you sell a piece of Canadian real estate but live elsewhere in the 
world, Canada still has a right to tax the gain because the asset, 
the real estate, is located in Canada.
Other countries have similar tax laws. If you own assets such as 
investments on which you earn dividends or interest; real estate 
on which you earn rental income or gains upon sale; or if you earn 
income such as pensions or employment income in another coun-
try, those other countries have the right to tax that income accord-
ing to the tax laws in those countries. 
If you’re paying attention, you’ll notice that residents in Canada 
are taxed on their worldwide income, and that other countries may 
tax you on that same income. Isn’t that double taxation? The good 
news is that Canada has tax treaties with many major countries in 
the world that are designed to avoid double taxation. If you pay tax 
to another country you can claim a foreign tax credit for the for-
eign taxes that will serve to offset the Canadian taxes paid on that 
same income. But be aware that if you earn income that comes 
from another country, you very well could have tax liabilities — 
and perhaps even tax filing requirements — in the other country. 
You may want to consult a tax pro.

Get Free Money from the 
Government
E
ven though you may not be required to file a tax return this 
year, consider doing so anyway. You can gain a lot of benefits 
from filing — including free money! — that far outweigh the time 
and frustration spent preparing your return. (Did we mention 
“free money”?)
Claiming GST Credits
You might be entitled to a tax-free quarterly cheque from the gov-
ernment for the Goods and Services Tax (GST) or the Harmonized 
Sales Tax (HST). That’s right; some of these dreaded sales taxes 
may actually be refunded to you via a tax credit. Not everyone 
is eligible for the GST/HST credit, but if you are eligible you can 
receive it only if you apply for it each year.
Applying is easy: When you file a tax return, tick the box that says 
you want to apply. The CRA will do the calculations and let you 
know if you qualify based on information such as your net income, 
the net income of your spouse, and the number of children under 
the age of 18 who live with you.
Even if you have no income, you need to file a tax return to apply 
for the GST/HST credit.
You’re entitled to the GST/HST credit when you turn 19, so you’ll 
need to file a tax return for at least the year prior to your 19th 
birthday to ensure you get your payments. If your birthday is in 
January, February, or March, file for the two years prior to your 19th 
birthday. If you forgot, you can always file after the fact.

Part I: Tips for Everyone  
18
Benefiting from Provincial 
Tax Credits
Many provinces and territories in Canada offer special tax credits 
to their residents. However, these credits do not come to you auto-
matically. You must apply for them on your personal tax return. 
The tax credits vary by province/territory and some are very gen-
erous. They include credits such as sales tax credits and property 
tax credits.
Receiving Child Benefits
If you’re responsible for the care of a child who is under age 18, 
you might be eligible to claim the Canada Child Tax Benefit (CCTB) 
for that child.
To apply for the CCTB, the first step is to complete Form RC66, 
Canada Child Benefits Application. However, because the benefits 
are based on net family income, you must file a tax return to sub-
stantiate your income. Even if your income is nil, file a tax return to 
ensure you don’t miss out on these benefits.
Obtaining Refunds for CPP 
or EI Overpayments
Canada Pension Plan (CPP) and Employment Insurance (EI) premi-
ums are deducted from your pay and reported on your personal 
tax return. If you’ve worked at only one job in the year, it’s unlikely 
that your CPP or EI premiums were drastically wrong. However, 
if you have more than one employer in a year, each employer is 
required to deduct CPP and EI based on your earnings at that job 
alone. In this case it’s very common that your total CPP and EI paid 
was too much. (By the way, this often has nothing to do with your 
employer’s payroll skills; it’s because of the way the calculation 
is done.)
You’re entitled to receive a refund of CPP and EI overpayments in 
the year. The way to do this is to file an income tax return.

 #3: Get Free Money from the Government 19
Knowing What to Do If You’ve 
Paid Too Much Tax
If you’ve earned employment income in the year, you should receive 
a T4 slip from your employer. Box 22 of that slip will note whether 
taxes were deducted from your pay. If you earn other types of 
income, such as investment income, you might be required to pay 
quarterly income tax instalments to the government. Either way, 
these taxes were based on a lot of assumptions, which may or may 
not reflect your tax reality at the end of the year. Depending on your 
personal circumstances, these taxes may be too high, which means 
you’re entitled to a tax refund. And you guessed it — the only way to 
claim a tax refund is to file a tax return.
Anytime you’ve paid taxes in the year, file a tax return just in case 
you’re entitled to a refund.
Claiming Other Benefits
Even if you don’t owe tax or have free money to claim, there still 
may be reasons to file a tax return, including:
 
✓ You want to maximize your RRSP contribution room for 
future years. You’re allowed to make RRSP contributions 
each year based on your RRSP contribution room, which is 
calculated using your earned income from prior years. In 
years when you have little income you may not need to file a 
return; however, even a little income may still be considered 
earned income, giving rise to RRSP room. Unused RRSP contri-
bution room never expires, so you could use it to claim RRSP 
deductions — and save taxes — down the road.
 
✓ You have deductions or credits to carry forward to future 
years. You may have incurred some costs that would normally 
be a tax deduction or credit, which are of no use to you 
because of your income level. Certain of these amounts can 
be carried forward to help your tax situation in future years, 
including tuition, education, and textbook amounts, RRSP 
contributions, and moving expenses.

Part I: Tips for Everyone  
20
 
✓ You received Working Income Tax Benefit (WITB) advance 
payments and you want to apply for WITB advance payments 
for the upcoming year.
 
✓ You have a non-capital loss, such as a loss on your unincor-
porated business, that you want to be able to apply in other 
years. Although that loss is not going to attract tax this year, 
you might be able to benefit from it in other years. And the only 
way to document the loss is by filing a tax return. Non-capital 
losses can be carried forward for 20 years. However, consider 
carrying your losses back (up to three years), if possible, to 
receive a tax benefit from the loss sooner rather than later.
 
✓ You want to continue to receive the Guaranteed Income 
Supplement or Allowance benefits under the Old Age 
Security Program. You can usually renew your benefit simply 
by filing your return by April 30. If you choose not to file a 
return, you will have to complete a renewal application form. 
This form is available from a Service Canada office or from the 
agency’s Web site.

Set Up a Good 
Recordkeeping System
D
o you want to know the secret to making sure you claim 
every deduction you’re entitled to? To saving money when 
you have a tax preparer do your tax return? To surviving a CRA 
audit unscathed? Sure you do! Luckily, we have the answer. Keep 
good records. That’s all there is to it, really. In this tip we spell out 
just how you can keep records that’ll turn even the harshest audi-
tor into a softie.
When dealing with the CRA, the burden of proof is on you to sup-
port the deductions you have claimed. The CRA is by law consid-
ered correct unless you can prove otherwise. Keeping good tax 
records is imperative so you can support your numbers.
Keeping Good Books and Records
You may think that by filing a tax return for the year you’ve 
absolved yourself of any further CRA requirements. Unfortunately, 
that’s not true. You see, the CRA requires every person who pays 
or collects taxes, or who is carrying on business in Canada, to keep 
books and records. This requirement means you have to keep 
information pertaining to your taxes in case the CRA asks to review 
it in the future. Your books and records must enable the CRA to 
determine your taxes payable for the year and must be supported 
by source documents to verify the amounts reported.
Make sure you keep all source documents pertaining to your tax 
return, which may include:
 
✓ Sales invoices
 
✓ Purchase invoices
 
✓ Cash-register receipts
 
✓ Written contracts
 
✓ Credit card receipts

Part I: Tips for Everyone  
22
 
✓ Delivery slips
 
✓ Deposit slips
 
✓ Cheques
 
✓ Bank statements
 
✓ General correspondence
When deciding what type of document to keep, consider this: What 
document will best verify your tax records? The stronger the evi-
dence, the less likely it is that your tax records will be rejected by 
the CRA.
The original bill is best — the CRA will not always accept can-
celled cheques and credit card statements as authentication of an 
expense.
Setting up your recordkeeping 
system
In our experience, the number-one reason why people end up 
paying more tax than they have to is that they keep lousy records. 
We know that taming the paper tiger is no mean feat. What follows 
are our best suggestions to make your tax organization and prepa-
ration tasks much easier.
Save all the receipts and records you think you might be able to 
use. It’s much more difficult to recover receipts that have been 
thrown away than to toss out whatever unnecessary paper you 
have left after your tax return is complete.
Our favourite method of organizing tax information is in an accor-
dion file — pick one up at any office supply store. (You could 
also use file folders or envelopes.) Label each section by expense 
category. Use the categories listed on the tax form you will be com-
pleting; for example, charitable donations, medical expenses, office 
supplies, parking, advertising, and so on. As you collect receipts 
throughout the year, sort them into the proper category. When it 
comes time to file your tax return, all you have to do is take out the 
receipts, add them up, and enter the total on the tax form.
Consider organizing your tax information by the tax schedules you 
have to file, such as Statement of Real Estate Rentals, Capital Gains 
and Losses, and Statement of Business Activities. If your tax return 
is uncomplicated, it might be sufficient to have one file for each 
year. As you receive your tax information throughout the year, just 
put it into the file.

 #4: Set Up a Good Recordkeeping System 23
Any of these storage methods will save you from tearing your 
house apart looking for that investment statement or charitable 
receipt you were using as a bookmark last June. Keep a copy of the 
tax return you filed for that year, and when you get your Notice of 
Assessment put it in the same folder.
Making use of your computer
Your computer can be a huge help in tracking your tax informa-
tion each year. Many software packages exist — each with its own 
merits. Speak with a knowledgeable software salesperson before 
purchasing to make sure you get only what you need. Don’t buy an 
expensive accounting package if you’re going to use only one or 
two components.
We recommend the software packages Quicken and Microsoft 
Money for tracking personal and small business expenses, and 
QuickBooks for tracking the expenses of larger businesses. These 
packages will help you do everything from tracking your investment 
portfolio to balancing your chequebook to monitoring payroll.
Using a software package to enter your data means more of a time 
commitment up front, but when you need the records for tax time 
your figures will be added up and ready to go.
If you do use a computer for all your recordkeeping, or if you have 
other valuable documents, store a recent backup of your computer 
files and those valuable documents, or copies of them, off-site. 
That way, if you suffer a fire or other disaster, all will not be lost.
(For more about tax software, check out Tip #6.)
Watching out for recordkeeping 
time bombs
Look out for these special situations:
 
✓ Automobile expenses: If you’re claiming automobile expenses 
for a vehicle used for both business and personal purposes, 
you must keep a logbook for a sample period of time to sup-
port the vehicle’s business use. Include details on dates, 
number of kilometres driven, and destinations. Because 
you’re allowed to claim only the business portion of your 
automobile expenses, it stands to reason that you need some 
sort of proof to show what percentage of your auto expenses 

Part I: Tips for Everyone  
24
are in fact business related. The logbook is the perfect solution. 
(See Tip #17 for more about automobile expenses.)
 
✓ Charitable receipts: An official receipt from a registered char-
ity is the only document accepted by the CRA for a charitable 
donation. Many charities now send these electronically. 
Cancelled cheques and ticket stubs will not be accepted. And 
if you want to claim a tax credit, ensure you’re donating to a 
registered charity — ask to see a registration number if you’re 
not sure. The registration number must appear on the receipt.
(For more about charities and taxes, see Tips #9 to 11.)
Knowing How Long to Keep 
Your Tax Records
One of the questions clients most frequently ask us is, “How long 
do I have to keep my records and receipts?” The answer, accord-
ing to the CRA, is six years. The books and records must be kept 
in Canada at your residence or place of business. These books and 
records must be made available to the CRA should it ask to see them.
Even though the CRA can’t go back and audit your tax return after 
six years — unless it suspects fraud, in which case all tax years are 
fair game — you need to keep purchase receipts and investment 
statements for assets you still own. You may need those records as 
proof of ownership if you ever have to make an insurance claim or 
if you sell the asset. And you may need proof of an asset’s cost in 
the future if the gain or loss must be reported on your tax return.
If a particular tax year is under objection or appeal, keep your 
books and records on hand until the objection or appeal has been 
resolved and the time for filing a further appeal has expired. It 
would be a shame to throw out your books and records only to 
have legitimate tax deductions denied down the road.
Dealing with Missing Information 
Slips and Receipts
For many types of income you earn, you will be sent information slips, 
commonly called T-slips, that document the income received and 
that must be reported on your income tax return. This includes 
slips such as T4s (reporting employment income), T5s (reporting
investment income), and slips from the government (Old Age 

 #4: Set Up a Good Recordkeeping System 25
Security, Canada Pension Plan, and Employment Insurance). You 
should receive these slips by the end of February in the year fol-
lowing the year in which you received the payment. However, T3 
slips (reporting trust income, such as from mutual funds) are often 
not available until after March 31. For other types of income such 
as business income, or capital gains from the sale of investments 
or other assets, no slips will be sent to you; it’s up to you to calcu-
late your income and report it on your tax return.
Just because you don’t have a slip doesn’t mean you’re absolved 
from reporting that income. If you know you earned income in the 
year you are required by law to report it on your tax return. If you 
are missing any slips, call the issuer for a new one. In the case of 
government-issued slips, you can request many of them online.
Giving the CRA your best estimate
If you’ve made a reasonable attempt to obtain your slip but you 
are still “slipless,” you need to estimate your income and related 
tax credits and deductions.
If it’s your T4 that’s missing, use your pay stubs to assist you in 
reporting your employment income and any tax credits or deduc-
tions for your CPP contributions, EI premiums, and union dues. 
Finally, don’t forget to report the income taxes withheld by your 
employer! Attach a note to your return stating you were unable 
to obtain your slip and have summarized the estimated amounts. 
Give the name and address of the person or organization that 
should have issued the slip.
You must still file your tax return by the April 30 filing deadline 
(or June 15, if you or your spouse are self-employed) even if you 
know information is missing. Attach a note to your return explain-
ing what is missing, detail any estimated amounts, and get it in on 
time! This is especially important if you owe money, because you 
will be charged a late filing penalty if the return is late — and inter-
est, if your balance owing is not paid by April 30.
Coping with missing receipts
Receipts for some deductions, such as RRSP contributions, charita-
ble donations, and medical expenses, must be attached to your tax 
return when it is filed (assuming you’re paper filing your return). 
If these receipts are not included with your return, processing will 
be delayed and your deductions may be  disallowed. Remember, 
the onus is on you to support all the income, deductions, and cred-
its reported on your tax return.

Part I: Tips for Everyone  
26
If a receipt is missing, call the person or organization respon-
sible for issuing it to obtain another copy. Even if you cannot get 
another copy before the April 30 tax return filing deadline, file your 
return on time. You can forward the receipt to the CRA when it 
does finally arrive. Alternatively, you can simply leave the deduc-
tion off your tax return and file an adjustment when you receive 
the receipt. (See Tip #75 for details.)
You don’t have to attach some types of receipts to your tax return. 
For example, if you have claims for union dues, tuition fees, or 
childcare expenses, you don’t need to attach the receipts to your 
return when you file it. However, be aware that the CRA does regu-
lar “reviews” of these types of credits and deductions, so ensure 
you have the proper documentation on hand should the CRA ask 
to see it in the future.
Don’t think you can get away from keeping receipts and other sup-
porting documentation because you are EFILING, NETFILING, or 
TELEFILING your return. The CRA can and often does ask to see 
the documentation! (See Tip #7 for more about alternate modes of 
filing your return.) 
Knowing what to do when the dog 
really did eat your tax records
Your worst nightmare has come to life — you’re being audited! 
And to top it off, Sparky has eaten some of your tax receipts. Does 
this mean you’ll lose out on all your legitimate tax deductions? Not 
necessarily. The CRA does understand that these situations can 
occur, and will give you the benefit of the doubt (sometimes) when 
you can show reasonable support for the income, deductions, and 
credits reported on your return.
If the CRA does come calling and you simply don’t have the 
records you need to support your tax deductions, you can still 
prove your claims were legitimate. It may take you some time to 
reconstruct records, but when you consider the alternatives (addi-
tional tax, interest, and penalties on disallowed deductions from an 
audit), the time you spend will be well worth it.
The simplest way to reconstruct missing tax records is to ask for 
new ones. For example, if you know you bought a number of pre-
scriptions this year but can’t find your receipts, go back to your 
local pharmacy and ask for a printout of your expenditures for the 
year. You will be surprised at how many deductions you will be 
able to reconstruct simply by asking for duplicate receipts.

 #4: Set Up a Good Recordkeeping System 27
If you sold or gave away an asset but you do not have a record of 
its original cost, either because you lost the relevant documents or 
because it was a gift, you can establish a cost in one of several ways:
 
✓ Look in newspapers from the year you purchased or were given 
an asset to determine what similar assets were selling for.
 
✓ If you’re trying to find information on a property, consult with 
the local real estate board. They usually keep historical data 
on property in the area. You could also go to the property tax 
collector’s office in your municipality. Their assessed values 
for the property might be of use.
 
✓ If you inherited an asset, the easiest way to establish its tax 
cost to you is to check the deceased’s final tax return to see 
at what price they were deemed to have disposed of the prop-
erty to you. This disposal price is the same as your tax cost.
 
✓ Call your investment advisor for help. Your advisor should 
have historical records of your financial affairs and may be 
able to help you calculate the cost of your shares, mutual 
funds, or other assets he or she manages.
Why is the cost value important? You need to know the original cost 
of the asset to properly calculate the capital gain or loss when the 
asset is eventually sold or otherwise disposed of — see Tips #38 
and #39 for more details.
If it’s your business records that have been lost or destroyed, you 
can re-create many of your expenses using the following tactics:
 
✓ Get copies of your phone, utility, credit card, rent, and other 
bills from the companies that issued the bills. Getting an annual 
statement from a major vendor shouldn’t be too difficult.
 
✓ Ask for duplicate bank statements and credit card statements 
that will help you to establish income and some of your 
expenses for the year.
 
✓ Keep separate personal and business bank accounts and 
credit cards so you can easily verify what is what.
 
✓ Reconstruct automobile expenses based on a reasonable esti-
mation of what it costs to run your type of vehicle. The dealer 
from whom you bought your car might be helpful in estimating 
these costs.
 
✓ Look at your previous years’ tax returns to establish your 
expenses in prior years and also your profit margins. If you 
have lost those, too, you can obtain copies of previous years’ 
returns from the CRA on request.

Know When Your Tax 
Return Is Due
F
iling your tax return on time is critical. If you don’t, and you 
owe money, you’ll be charged a late filing penalty in addition 
to interest on the taxes outstanding. And even if you don’t owe 
money, it’s still a good idea to file on time so that you don’t need-
lessly hold up your refund and benefit payments!
If your due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or public holiday, you 
have until the next business day to file and you will not be consid-
ered late. 
Due Date for Regular Folk
Personal income tax returns for the previous calendar year are 
due by midnight, April 30. If you’re electronically filing your return, 
ensure you get confirmation that your return went through before 
this time. And if you’re mailing in your return, ensure it’s post-
marked as being mailed on or before April 30. If you just put your 
return in a regular mailbox and it’s not picked up until the next 
day, it will be considered late-filed.
If you have a balance owing on your taxes and don’t file on time, 
you will be charged an automatic 5 percent late filing penalty 
based on the amount owing. A further penalty of 1 percent of the 
unpaid tax will also be added for each full month the return is late, 
up to a maximum of 12 months (so, there’s an additional 12 per-
cent maximum penalty). If you’re late a second time within three 
years of the first late filing, the penalty is bumped up to a maxi-
mum of 40 percent! And that’s not all: you’ll have to pay interest, 
too. Ouch! Even if you cannot pay your tax, make sure you file your 
return on time to avoid these penalties!

 #5: Know When Your Tax Return Is Due 29
Due Date When You’re 
Self-Employed
If you or your spouse carried on an unincorporated business and 
have self-employment income to claim, your return is not due until 
June 15. However, if you owe taxes, you must estimate your tax bill 
and pay it by April 30 to avoid interest charges.
Special Due Dates in 
the Year of Death
The due date for the return of a person who died in the year 
depends upon the date of death. If the death occurred between 
January 1 and October 31, the return is due on April 30 of the next 
year. However, in recognition that pulling together tax documents 
for an individual who has passed away can be challenging, when an 
individual has died between November 1 and December 31 the due 
date is extended to six months after the date of death, which will 
be some time after the normal April 30 deadline.
The tax return of the surviving spouse is due the same day as the 
deceased’s return. However, if there will be a balance owing on the 
survivor’s return, it’s due on April 30 following the year of death.
If the deceased or the deceased’s spouse had been self-employed, 
different due dates apply. In that case, if death occurred between 
January 1 and December 15, the due date for the return is June 15 
of the following year. For deaths between December 16 and the end 
of the year, the return is due six months after the date of death.
If death occurs in January to April, it may be difficult to file the tax 
return for the immediately preceding tax year. In that case, the 
prior year’s tax return and any taxes owing are due six months fol-
lowing death. For example, if John died on February 1 of this year, 
his last year’s tax return is not due until August of this year (it nor-
mally would have been due April 30). Any tax liability from the final 
tax year (which will include only the month of January) is payable 
by April 30 of next year.
Although you’re given the option to file the final tax return on these 
alternate dates, it can be filed at any time after the date of death and 
will generally be processed right away as a service to the estate, 
using legislation applicable to the most recent tax year. You can 
request a reassessment of the return later if the tax laws change.

Choose the Preparation 
Option That’s Best for You
S
o many choices, so little time. You know you have to file a tax 
return, but do you prepare your return yourself the old fash-
ioned way, or using your computer, or do you throw in the towel 
and hire someone to do it for you? 
Using Your Computer vs a 
Pencil to Tally Your Taxes
Ever thought of preparing your tax return using your computer 
instead of the old pencil and calculator method? Think about it. No 
more adding machines or the dreaded smell of correction fluid. No 
more tearing through the paper when you’ve erased the amount 
on line 150 one too many times. Tax preparation software makes 
sense when you’ve already dived into the world of preparing your 
own return. And even for those of you still sitting on the fence, 
tax preparation software may provide the nudge you need. When 
choosing between preparing a return on paper or on the computer, 
we’d choose the computer every time.
We’re not the only ones who would choose the computer. 
According to the government, more than half the tax returns filed 
in 2008 were filed electronically. That adds up to a whopping 13.1 
million returns prepared and delivered via computer. This number 
has been growing, and is expected to continue. 
Looking at the perks and perils 
of going the techno route
Using software to prepare your tax return has a number of advan-
tages over paper-filing. The favourite, of course, is automatic 
recalculation: When one number on your return changes, the pro-
gram updates all relevant forms and recalculates your final tax bill.

 #6: Choose the Preparation Option That’s Best for You 31
Another advantage is that most software packages are dummy-
proof, set up so all you need to do is find the window that corre-
sponds to the particular slip you have — be it a T4, T3, T5, or so 
on — and fill it in based on what appears in your boxes. This can 
save you a lot of time and frustration!
Most tax software programs allow you to NETFILE your tax return, 
which is fast, efficient, and ecologically friendly. NETFILING means 
you send your return using the Internet, instead of printing it and 
mailing it in. If you’re anticipating a refund, you can expect to get it 
faster when you NETFILE, which is an added bonus!
Computers aren’t people. They can’t look at numbers to determine 
whether they’re reasonable, or whether they’re correct. No com-
puter will tell you to think again before deducting your all-inclusive 
trip for two to Jamaica as a business expense.
Shopping for tax software
It’s surprising to see how many software programs are available 
to prepare Canadian tax returns. If your return is simple and 
you don’t print off a copy to mail in to the CRA, pretty much any 
program will do the trick. That being said, some programs don’t 
prepare Quebec returns, so watch out for that. If your return is 
complicated and you’re looking for guidance, it’s worth it to pay 
a few extra bucks for the more sophisticated programs. Assuming 
you want to NETFILE your return, here are some CRA-certified 
options:
 
✓ GenuTax: Downloadable multiyear software — you don’t pay 
for annual updates! The software is Windows-only and doesn’t 
support Quebec returns. Visit www.genutax.ca.
 
✓ H&R Block: You can have H&R Block complete your return 
for you, or use their Windows or Online Tax Programs to do 
your own taxes. Go to www.hrblock.ca for more information.
 
✓ myTaxExpress: For Windows users only, this program boasts 
a free trial before purchase and can handle Quebec returns. 
See www.mytaxexpress.com for details.
 
✓ QuickTax (Windows; download or CD-ROM, or online via Quick
TaxWeb from Intuit Canada): QuickTax is Canada’s best-selling 
tax software. Gather your receipts and answer the simple 
questions posed by EasyStep Interview in English or French. 
The program takes your information and puts it where it

belongs on the federal and Quebec forms. QuickTax reviews 
your return when you’re finished, and even alerts you to any 
missed deductions or credits. You can NETFILE your return 
with both the desktop and online versions. Check out www.
quicktax.intuit.ca.
 
✓ Tax Chopper (formerly CuteTax): Online software; no Quebec 
returns. Get more info at www.cutetax.ca.

versions, comes in English and French and can handle Quebec 
returns. Support is available online or by phone in English, 
French, Chinese, Hindi, and Punjabi. For more details, visit 
www.taxtron.ca.
 
✓ UFile: UFile is another program with Quebec capabilities. You 
can either use the UFile.ca online version or buy UFile for 
Windows to install on your PC. Check it out at www.ufile.ca.
Getting the Most from Tax Pros
When your plumbing is broken, do you immediately call the 
plumber, or do you try to fix it yourself? For some, calling for help 
is the last resort — and preparing their own tax return is no excep-
tion. Sometimes, however, admitting defeat and hiring someone 
before you get into trouble is a good idea.
Dealing with a tax professional
Be sure you have accumulated all the information necessary before 
sending it to your preparer. When you have a business, your best 
bet is to summarize all your revenue and expenses ahead of time. 
You’ll cut down on your fee, and ensure no relevant information is 
omitted.
Hiring someone may be a good idea if you need some tax-planning 
advice. Sometimes the additional fees you pay may actually be 
recovered in saved taxes! However, be careful whom you hire for 
tax planning, because some individuals are more competent than 
others. We tell you how to find that “special” person next.

 #6: Choose the Preparation Option That’s Best for You 33
Asking the right questions
The Yellow Pages has dozens of pages of accounting firms and 
businesses that specialize in tax. Finding a reputable tax profes-
sional is kind of like finding a mechanic — you’ve got to be care-
ful. In your initial meeting, the tax professional should ask a lot of 
questions about your situation. Ask her some questions, too, to 
make sure you’ve found the right person.
Here’s a list of questions to ask your tax professional to ensure he 
or she can handle your situation:
 
✓ What services do you offer? Some tax professionals only pre-
pare tax returns; others will help you with other matters such 
as retirement planning or estate planning.
 
✓ Have you worked in this area before? When you have your 
own business, or are an avid investor, make sure your profes-
sional has worked with similar situations before. Many firms 
have specialists in particular areas, but some may be used to 
working with employees whose tax documentation consists of 
a T4 and RRSP slips.
 
✓ Who will prepare my return? Unless you’re dealing with a 
sole practitioner, the person you’re speaking to will not neces-
sarily prepare your return. Don’t be alarmed if a junior staff 
member prepares your return — this is common practice and 
can actually save you preparation fees. However, ensure that 
a senior tax professional reviews it for errors.
 
✓ What is your fee structure? Most tax professionals charge 
by the hour, so make sure you ask upfront for the hourly fee, 
as well as for an estimate of the time your project will take to 
complete.
 
✓ What qualifications do you have? Many tax professionals are 
chartered accountants, and many are also certified financial 
planners. Those who specialize in tax should also have com-
pleted a two-year, in-depth tax course offered by the Canadian 
Institute of Chartered Accountants.

Figure Out How to File 
Your Return
A
fter you prepare your tax return (refer to Tip #6 for a look at 
your preparation options), you have some choices for filing 
your return with the CRA. What’s the best choice for you?
Read on. . . .
Turn It In Online: Electronically 
File Your Return
Electronically filing your return is a great choice because it’s rela-
tively easy, you can get your refund faster, and you can save a tree 
and the cost of a stamp! 
Electronic filing is just that; you use a computer to send your 
tax information to the CRA’s computer. It’s kind of like e-mailing 
versus sending a letter. 
Understanding the difference 
between EFILING and NETFILING
There are two methods of electronically filing your return:
 
✓ EFILING is used only when you’ve hired someone to prepare 
your return for you. The government must approve tax pre-
parers to EFILE, so if you hire someone to do your taxes you’ll 
want to ask them whether they are EFILE-approved.
You can’t EFILE your tax return yourself. You must first have your 
return prepared by an approved electronic filer. Most businesses 
that offer tax preparation services are registered to EFILE returns.
 
✓ If you’ve prepared yourself using approved software (see 
Tip #6), you have the option of NETFILING your return. At 
the end of the day, EFILE and NETFILE are essentially 
accomplishing the same thing.

 #7: Figure Out How to File Your Return 35
 
 To be able to NETFILE your return to the CRA, you must pre-
pare it using certified tax preparation software. Basically, the 
software saves your return in a format the CRA can read. A 
list of approved software is available on the CRA’s Web site at 
www.netfile.gc.ca/software-e.html. You can also take 
a look at Tip #6, where we discuss tax software and the pro-
grams that are NETFILE-compatible.
 
 If you’re able to NETFILE, the CRA will send you a four-digit 
access code in your tax return information package. If you lose 
the number, go to the NETFILE Web site and apply for your 
code online, get it via MyAccount (see Tip #8), or call for help.
The CRA doesn’t want professional tax preparers to use NETFILE; 
to prevent this, they’ve place a limit of 20 returns per computer 
per year that can be prepared with certified tax software. Keep 
that in mind if you love taxes and agree to do returns for more 
than 20 family members and friends each year (sigh).
Considering the benefits 
of filing online
Most people like EFILING their return because they get their assess-
ments and refunds faster. In fact, the wait is cut to two weeks from 
the usual four to six if you’re a procrastinator and file toward the 
end of April. If you’re one of those who file in the middle of March, 
you may actually see your refund in just over a week!
Some other benefits of EFILE are that it
 
✓ Saves the CRA from having to manually input your data, 
reducing the likelihood of data entry errors 
 
✓ Is secure
 
✓ Is fast
 
✓ Is environmentally friendly
 
✓ Provides confirmation right away that your return has been 
received — handy when you’re filing at the last minute and 
are worried about potential late filing penalties
 
✓ Saves you money on stationery, printing, and mailing

Part I: Tips for Everyone  
36
Assessing your chances of an 
audit when you file online
The first thing to keep in mind is that there is a difference between 
having your tax return audited and having some of your deductions 
or credits reviewed. EFILED and NETFILED returns are selected for 
audit using the same criteria as paper-filed returns. So if you’re 
worried about an audit, you’re neither increasing nor decreas-
ing your odds by filing online. On the other hand, because you’re 
not sending supporting documentation such as donation or RRSP 
receipts to the CRA when you file online, the CRA will do regular 
reviews of these types of deductions to ensure you have support 
for your claims. Such reviews keep the integrity of the tax system 
in check.
If you don’t like having any contact with the CRA after you file your 
return other than the report card called the Notice of Assessment, 
then we don’t suggest you file online. You see, because no sup-
porting documentation is sent to the CRA when you file online, a 
CRA representative may contact you asking for backup informa-
tion for some of your claims. The most common requests are for 
childcare, medical, and donation receipts. The CRA tries to select 
only returns for which they anticipate a higher probability of non-
compliance, but this is not always the case. Don’t panic, however, 
if you receive a request to send more information. It doesn’t mean 
you’re being audited. Simply send in the information requested — 
assuming you’ve kept your documentation (see Tip #4), you have 
nothing to worry about.
Figuring out who can file online
The majority of Canadian taxpayers can have their return elec-
tronically filed. Individuals who can’t EFILE or NETFILE include 
non-residents, taxpayers whose social insurance number begins 
with “0,” individuals who came to or left Canada during the tax 
year, individuals who have declared bankruptcy, and people who 
have to pay income tax to more than one province or territory. 
Tax returns of deceased individuals cannot be filed online either. 
You can file electronically only for the current tax year. Past year’s 
returns must be paper-filed.

 #7: Figure Out How to File Your Return 37
Paper Filing: The Old-
Fashioned Way
Although we’re living in the techno age, we realize that not every-
one embraces the computer. If you want to paper file your return 
you have two preparation options:
 
✓ You can go totally old school and fill out your tax forms by 
hand — you can ask the CRA to send you the forms, print 
them from the CRA Web site, or pick up a copy at your local 
post office or CRA office.
 
✓ You can go for a hybrid approach, preparing the return 
using your computer but then printing off a copy to mail.
After you’ve prepared the return, the paper-filing is easy. Just 
attach necessary information slips and receipts (T-slips, RRSP 
slips, and donation and medical receipts, among others), sign your 
return, and place it in the mail. Make sure you postmark it no later 
than midnight on April 30 to avoid late filing penalties. And don’t 
forget a cheque, if you have a balance owing.
TELEFILE: By Invitation Only
With TELEFILE, you don’t need to have someone else prepare and 
file your return. You can electronically file your own return. All 
you need is a touch-tone phone, your social insurance number, an 
invitation from the CRA to TELEFILE if you wish, and a personal 
access code. The system accepts income tax information such as 
employment income, pension income, interest income, RRSP con-
tributions, and charitable donations. The more complex returns 
would take more telephone time, and often the CRA needs to see 
supporting documentation in order to process them.
Only those individuals who would ordinarily file the T1 Special 
return instead of the longer T1 “general” return are eligible for 
TELEFILE. The T1 Special, or T1S, is sent to individuals who are 
wage and salary earners only, students, seniors, and filers who 
file only to obtain tax credits. When individuals eligible to use 
TELEFILE receive their tax package from the CRA, they will also 
receive the TELEFILE invitation along with an access code and 
instructions on how to use the system.

Money in the Bank: Direct Deposit 
of Your Tax Refund
When you set up direct deposit with the CRA you get your tax 
refund a few days earlier than if it were mailed to you. You don’t 
need to worry about your mail being lost or making a trip to your 
bank.
Complete form T1DD, “Direct Deposit Request,” with your bank-
ing details. This form can be sent in to the CRA at any time. If you 
haven’t sent it in before your tax return is completed, you can send 
it in with your return. 
In addition to having your tax refund automatically deposited to 
your bank account, you can have your entitlement to other pay-
ments such as the GST/HST credit, working income tax benefit, 
Canada Child Tax Benefit, and Universal Child Care Benefit depos-
ited to your bank account. 
Form T1DD can also be used to change information you’ve previ-
ously sent to the CRA. You do not need to redo the form each year, 
however: After it is set up, the CRA will continue to deposit funds 
to the account. They will never forget!
Don’t forget to tell the CRA when you close a bank account. 
Refunds sent to a closed bank account will eventually be returned 
to the CRA, which will then send a cheque to the taxpayer. 
However, there are delays (weeks or months) in making all this 
happen. Avoid the hassle and advise the CRA of new banking infor-
mation immediately.

When and How to Get Help 
from the CRA Itself
Believe it or not, the CRA Web site (www.cra-arc.gc.ca) is an 
excellent source for information. Here, you can download a copy of 
the income tax package and request additional forms. The site also 
contains detailed information on the most frequently requested 
topics.
TIPS
If your question relates to your tax situation or you need general 
help, try the CRA’s automated TIPS line (Tax Information Phone 
Service). Call 1-800-267-6999.
Personal info
To obtain specific information on your tax account, you need 
to provide your social insurance number, your month and year 
of birth, and the total income reported on line 150 of your last 
assessed return.
Here’s a rundown of what TIPS can tell you:
 
✓ Tax refund: Find out the status of your refund.
 
✓ Goods and Services Tax/Harmonized Sales Tax (GST/HST) 
credit: See whether you’re eligible to receive the credit and 
when you can expect to receive a payment.
 
✓ Child Tax Benefit: Find out whether you’re eligible to receive 
the benefit and when you can expect to receive a payment.
 
✓ Universal Child Care Benefit: Find out when your next pay-
ment is coming. (Or, if you have a child under 6 and you’re 
not already receiving the UCCB, find out how to apply.)
 
✓ RRSP deduction limit: Want to know your RRSP deduction 
contribution limit for the year? TIPS has your answer.
General info
TIPS also provides general recorded information:
 
✓ Info-Tax: General tax information on a number of tax topics.
 
✓ Bulletin Board: Recent tax and benefit information.

 #8: Know Where to Turn for Help 41
 
✓ Business Information: Tax and GST information for those 
who operate a business or are thinking of starting one up (for 
example, how to handle payroll tax, CPP, and EI deductions).
My Account
The CRA offers a service through its Web site called My Account, 
where you can access information about your personal tax and 
benefits 7 days a week, 21 hours a day.
My Account is quite an innovative service for the CRA. (We’re 
impressed, at least!) It give you access to information about your:
 
✓ Tax refund or balance owing
 
✓ Tax instalment payments made or owing
 
✓ Direct deposit or preauthorized payment plan information
 
✓ RRSP, Home Buyers’ Plan, and Lifelong Learning Plan eligibil-
ity and outstanding balances
 
✓ Child Tax Benefit entitlements
 
✓ Universal Child Care Benefit entitlements
 
✓ GST/HST Credit eligibility
 
✓ Disability Tax Credit eligibility
Sure beats trying to phone in the middle of tax season, when all 
you get is a busy signal! You can also use My Account to change 
your filed return, to change your address and/or phone number, 
and to dispute your Notice of Assessment.
To access My Account, you need to register for a Government of 
Canada epass. You can do this by going into My Account on the 
CRA Web site. After you’ve completed the registration process 
and chosen your password, CRA mails an activation code to you. 
Just key in the CRA activation code and your password to get full 
access to My Account for the first time. After that, you’ll just need 
to enter your password.
When you don’t have an epass but need immediate access to some 
of your tax information, you can go into the Quick Access section of 
My Account. Quick Access will tell you the status of your tax return 
and benefit payments and your RRSP deduction limit. To identify 
yourself, have your social insurance number, date of birth, and total 
income from line 150 of your last processed tax return handy.

Enquiring by phone
Agents are also available to answer your questions by phone, Monday 
to Friday (except holidays), 8:15 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. To accommodate 
the flood of calls during tax season, these hours are extended until 
10:00 p.m. weekdays, and include weekends from 9:00 a.m. to 1:00 
p.m. from mid-February to April 30 (excluding Easter). Contact the 
CRA by phone at 1-800-959-8281.
If your query is in regard to electronic services (NETFILE, TELEFILE,
or My Account), call the e-service Helpdesk at 1-800-714-7257.
If you would like someone else to call the CRA on your behalf, be 
sure you’ve completed and mailed consent form T1013, “Authorizing 
or Cancelling a Representative.” This form gives the CRA permission 
to discuss your tax affairs with someone other than you.
Visiting your local Tax 
Services Office
If you can’t find the information you need on the Web site, through 
TIPS, or through My Account, try contacting your local Tax 
Services Office (TSO). (Note, though, that they really prefer you to 
call the toll-free number — we just want to give you some options!) 
The TSOs are open Monday to Friday (except holidays, of course), 
8:15 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. (sometimes 5:00 p.m.). To find the location of 
your nearest TSO, visit the CRA’s Web site and click “Contact us” 
from the main menu. Service is by appointment only.
Where to Get Forms and 
Other Information
The package that’s sent by the CRA in mid-February contains only 
the most commonly used forms. If you didn’t receive a package, or 
need an additional one, you have many options:
 
✓ Download forms from the CRA Web site
 
✓ Use the online order form on the CRA Web site to order forms 
and have them mailed to you
 
✓ Call 1-800-959-2221 and ask for forms to be mailed to you
 
✓ Pick up the T1 General Guide and Forms package from any 
postal outlet or Service Canada office

Reduce Your Tax by Giving to 
Registered Charities
T
wo advantages arise from giving to registered charities. (Well, 
more than two likely apply, but we deal with two in this tip.) 
One, you’re assisting those in need of your help — and two; this 
assistance can result in some tax savings. This tax savings can 
then be donated to charity, which results in additional tax savings, 
which . . . you get the picture. Charitable donations to registered 
charities (and other qualified donees such as charitable founda-
tions) result in federal income tax savings as well as provincial or 
territorial income tax savings. 
Make Donations That Qualify 
for Tax Savings
You’re able to claim charitable donations made by either you or your 
spouse/common-law partner. (We talk about charitable donations 
made by your spouse/common-law partner a little more at the end 
of this tip.) Add up all the donations made during the year, and don’t 
forget any donations you made through payroll deductions — these 
donations will be shown on your respective T4 slips.
Charitable donations don’t need to be made in cash. In Tip #10 we 
discuss giving away assets and highlight the special tax treatment 
(read “tax savings”) available when you make a donation of a pub-
licly listed security. 
To claim a tax credit for making a charitable donation you must 
receive an official receipt from the registered charity acknowledg-
ing your donation. (We comment on the information to be noted 
on the receipt in Tip #11.) An exception to the need for an official 
receipt occurs where donations have been made through the pay-
roll at your work and the amount is noted on your T4.

Part I: Tips for Everyone  
44
Know the Tax Savings from Making 
Charitable Donations
The tax savings in claiming charitable donations is two-tiered: 
 
✓ On the first $200 of donations the federal income tax credit is 
15 percent 
 
✓ On the remainder, the federal income tax credit is increased 
to 29 percent 
If you claim $200 in donations you’ll save $30 in federal income 
tax. If you contribute an extra $100, for a total of $300, you’ll save an 
additional $29 in federal income tax. There is an obvious incentive 
to donate more than $200 in a year. The provinces/territories also 
offer two-tier tax credit amounts.
Review the Amount of Charitable 
Donations You Should Claim
The total of the donations being claimed in a year is reported on 
schedule 9 of your tax return and the federal tax savings is calcu-
lated on schedule 1 of your return. The provincial/territorial credit 
is calculated on the respective provincial/territorial forms.
Limit of donations you can claim
Generally, you can claim charitable donations up to the limit of 75 
percent of your net income reported on line 236. (In Tip #10 we 
comment on a special rule dealing with donations made in the year 
of death.)
To the extent your charitable donations are restricted in a year to 
the 75 percent of net income limit, the excess amount can be carried 
forward for potential claim in the subsequent five years — again, 
subject to the 75 percent of net income limit test. If the charitable 
donations cannot be claimed by the end of the fifth carryforward 
year, then no claim for those charitable donations can be made.
Defer claiming charitable donations
You don’t have to claim the donations you made in 2009 on your 
2009 return. Claiming charitable donations in the year they’re 

 #9: Reduce Your Tax by Giving to Registered Charities 45
made is optional. It may be more beneficial not to claim them for 
2009 but rather to carry forward the donation amount to claim on 
your return for one or the next five carryforward years. This would 
be to your benefit if
 
✓ You already have sufficient tax credits to eliminate your tax 
liability, or
 
✓ Your donations were less than $200 in 2009. By deferring claim-
ing these you can combine them with your 2010 donations and 
claim them on your 2010 return. If the combined total was in 
excess of $200 then the increased 29% tax credit, not the 15% 
tax credit, would apply to the excess. If the total still did not 
exceed $200, you could combine your 2009, 2010, and 2011 
donations and . . . well, you get the idea.
Bump Up Donations at 
the End of the Year
Okay, say it’s nearing the end of December and you wish to make 
charitable donations. You want to receive an official receipt from 
a registered charity that notes your donation was made in the cur-
rent year so you can have the tax savings for the year.
You can make your charitable donations using your credit card. As 
long as your donation transaction is processed by the end of the 
year, the receipt will be dated with the current year. 
Combine Your Donations with 
Your Spouse/Common-Law 
Partner’s Donations
As we note earlier in this tip, you’re permitted to claim charitable 
donations made by you and your spouse/common-law partner. It’s 
generally beneficial to claim charitable donations made by both you 
and your spouse/common-law partner on one tax return. With the 
two-tiered level of tax savings noted above you and your spouse/
common-law partner are subject to the 15 percent limit on the first 
$200 only once — not twice — so you can maximize the amount of 
donations subject to the 29 percent federal tax credit.

Take Advantage of Special 
Rules for Charitable 
Donations
I
n Tip #9 we discuss the nuts and bolts (okay, mainly the dollars 
and percentages) of the tax savings available by making dona-
tions to registered charities. It turns out we have a lot more to say 
on how making charitable donations can reduce your tax bite.
Donate Assets Rather Than Cash
Rather than donating cash to a charity, you can choose to give 
other types of assets. When you “gift” an asset, in most cases 
you’re considered to have sold the asset for a price equal to 
the market value at the time. This is what tax geeks refer to as a 
deemed disposition and it can trigger a capital gain on the asset, 
which in turn triggers a tax liability despite the fact that you did 
not receive any cash to fund the tax. However, there likely will not 
be any tax to pay, because you’ll receive an official receipt to claim 
a charitable donation equal to the market value of the property. 
Only 50 percent of a capital gain is subject to tax (see Tip #38), 
and the value of the gift noted on the official receipt from the regis-
tered charity will be 100 percent of the market value.
Publicly listed securities
Special tax treatment is provided when publicly listed securities, 
such as shares of public companies or mutual funds, are directly 
donated to a registered charity (or charitable foundation). The tax-
able capital gain is reduced to zero, while at the same time you’re 
able to claim a charitable donation tax credit for the full market 
value of the securities donated.

 #10: Take Advantage of Special Rules for Charitable Donations 47
Rather than selling securities and donating the cash, donate the 
securities. The charity is free to sell the securities, and charities do 
not pay tax! This way, you’ll pay no tax and still get the same dona-
tion credit.
Cultural and ecological gifts
Unlike other donations, the donation claim for cultural and eco-
logical gifts is not limited to a percentage of net income. (In Tip #9 
we discuss how the amount you can claim in a year is generally 
restricted to 75 percent of your net income as reported on line 236 
of your tax return.) If you don’t want to claim the full amount — or 
don’t need to because your tax liability is already nil — you can 
choose to claim a portion in the current year and carry forward 
the unused portion for up to five years.
Donations of cultural property and ecologically sensitive land also 
enjoy an exemption from capital gains tax. That’s an added tax 
advantage!
Donate in the United States
You may want to donate some to our big neighbour to the south, 
but are hesitant because you’re not sure if there are any tax benefits. 
Good news — donating to charities and universities in the land 
of the brave and the home of the free does yield some tax breaks. 
Here’s how:
 
✓ Donate to U.S. charities: Generally, donations to foreign chari-
ties are not eligible for a credit on your Canadian tax return. 
However, you can claim donations to U.S. charities, subject 
to a limitation of 75 percent of your U.S. source income, as 
long as the charitable organization is recognized as such by 
U.S. law and would have qualified in Canada had it been a 
Canadian organization.
 
✓ Donate to U.S. universities: If you make a donation to a quali-
fying foreign university, the donation can be treated as though 
it were a Canadian donation; that is, you don’t have to have 
U.S. source income to benefit from the donation. A qualified 
university is one where the student body normally includes 
students from Canada. A listing of these universities can be 
found in Schedule VIII of the Income Tax Regulations; most 
large U.S. universities are included.

Be Wary of Charity Fraud and 
Charity Tax Shelters
I
n making charitable donations you want to be sure your money 
is going to a good cause and that the tax savings you’re expect-
ing will in fact occur.
Sometimes things can look too good to be true. Each year, a 
number of charity tax shelters are “sold.” (We comment on tax 
shelters later in this tip.) Many will provide an official charitable 
receipt for more than you actually donate. As you may expect, the 
CRA frowns on these structures and has overturned a number of 
them. The result? Taxpayers are out their money, and, in some 
cases, are provided with no tax relief at all. Many charities that 
have participated in these structures have lost their registered 
charity status.
Check the Charity’s Registration
You can claim only amounts you gave to registered Canadian char-
ities and qualified donees (such as a charitable foundation).
To see whether an organization is a legitimate charity, check its 
registration status on the CRA Web site (www.cra-arc.gc.ca/
charities). If the name doesn’t come up it’s not registered and 
not authorized to give out official receipts.
Look at Your Official Receipt
A number of organizations give out receipts for your donation that 
are not “official” receipts. The amounts you give to these organiza-
tions cannot be claimed as a charitable donation. The question 
to ask is not whether you’ll receive a receipt, but whether you’ll 
receive an official receipt, with the charity’s registration number 
noted on it. 

 #11: Be Wary of Charity Fraud and Charity Tax Shelters 49
The CRA requires the following to be noted on an official receipt:
 
✓ Your name and address.
 
✓ The charity’s business number (BN), which is also known as 
its charitable registration number. This is a 9-digit number 
followed by “RR.”
 
✓ The amount of the cash donated or the market value of a non-
cash donation.
 
✓ The date of the donation. If the donation was in cash, then 
simply the year needs to be noted.
 
✓ The statement “official receipt for income tax purposes.”
 
✓ A notation of the CRA’s name and Web site (www.cra.
gc.ca/charities).
 
✓ A unique serial number.
Take Care in Investing in 
Charity Tax Shelters
Generally, a tax shelter is considered to be an arrangement where 
a taxpayer can claim tax deductions or tax credits greater than the 
cost to the taxpayer within a four-year period.
The CRA has cracked down on charity tax shelters that they call 
“donation schemes.” The CRA cautions taxpayers who are consid-
ering participating in charity tax shelter arrangements that they 
need to be apprised of the associated risk of the CRA not accepting 
it as legitimate.
The CRA notes that charity tax shelters can take the forms of
 
✓ Gifting trust arrangements,
 
✓ Leveraged cash donations, and
 
✓ “Buy low, donate high” arrangements.
Even if the tax shelter has been assigned a CRA tax shelter number, 
no guarantee exists the taxpayer will receive the proposed tax 
benefit.
In overturning many of these structures the CRA has reduced the 
eligible amount for the tax credit available to the taxpayer to no 
more than the cash donation — or less, or none at all.

Respond Promptly to 
Requests from the CRA for 
Information
D
uring the initial tax assessment, or as a result of the re-review 
of your return, the CRA may have questions. To obtain the 
information it needs to answer these questions, the CRA will send 
you a letter called a “Request for Additional Information” as part of 
a “pre-assessment review.” This letter will usually ask for specific 
information and will include a mailing label where the information 
is to be sent, a CRA reference number, contact information from 
the person sending the request, and a date when the information 
must be received (usually 30 days from the date of the request). Is 
the letter the beginning of a full audit of your return? Should you 
seek professional advice? Should you run screaming into the hills? 
The answer is no. 
CRA’s Verification Process
A request for information is a normal part of the CRA’s verification 
process. Don’t worry! A request for information doesn’t automati-
cally mean you owe more tax.
Electronically filed tax returns
Requests for information are becoming increasingly common as 
more taxpayers choose to electronically file their returns by EFILE, 
TELEFILE, and NETFILE. Remember that returns filed electronically 
are sent without any supporting documentation (receipts, etc.). 
To maintain the integrity of our tax system, the CRA asks for proof 
that certain items on your tax return are accurate and verifiable.

 #12: Respond Promptly to Requests from the CRA for Information 51
Paper-filed tax returns
Even if you haven’t electronically filed your return, you still may 
receive a request for information. One of the most common rea-
sons is that a particular receipt or slip of paper was not included 
with your paper-filed return. Perhaps the information was unclear 
or incomplete, or the CRA is doing random compliance checks to 
test the accuracy of returns.
The latter request is usually the result of a “desk audit.” Such 
audits are done at the Tax Services Office and are primarily 
intended to test a large number of returns and identify potential 
problems that may be forwarded for a full audit. As long as the 
information you’ve reported on your tax return is truthful, sup-
portable, and within the tax laws, you should have nothing to 
worry about.
Figuring Out What the 
CRA Is Looking For
The following is our unofficial hit list of items the CRA reviews 
most often with requests to see supporting documentation: 
 
✓ RRSP contributions, including a review of past overcontri-
butions. Why? The CRA wants to be sure the amount you’ve 
deducted is correct. In addition, because RRSP assets can 
earn tax-sheltered income, the CRA wants to make sure all 
the money that has found its way into your RRSP is supposed 
to be there. In the past, this wasn’t reviewed often and many 
Canadians were over their allowable maximum $2,000 RRSP 
overcontribution. A few years ago the CRA began a big push 
to get this problem under control.
 
✓ Moving expenses. Why? Because often they are large, and 
sometimes employers have reimbursed the employees but the 
employees still claim a tax deduction. Keep all your receipts 
when you’re claiming moving expenses.
 
✓ Interest expense. Why? Because if you borrow to invest in a 
non-registered investment account, or for a business purpose, 
you can generally deduct the interest cost on your tax return. 
But the rules can be complex, and some taxpayers comingle 
personal and investment loans, making this an expense that is 
often misrepresented. 

Part I: Tips for Everyone  
52
Keep all supporting documentation — and please, we beg you, keep 
personal and investment or business loans separate.
 
✓ Childcare expenses. The CRA usually wants verification 
that the amount claimed is supported by a receipt or T4 slip 
(say, when you have a nanny), and that the costs were in fact 
incurred for childcare (and not sports or other activities).
 
✓ Medical expenses and charitable donations. These are 
reviewed particularly when large. If you’re reporting sig-
nificant medical expenses or charitable donations, we rec-
ommend you don’t EFILE or NETFILE your return so that 
processing will not be delayed by a request for information.
 
✓ Disability tax credit claims. This is a standard review item for 
the CRA each year. Why? Because very specific criteria must 
be met to claim this credit (see Tip #61). Some individuals 
may have some incapacity but don’t meet the statutory defi-
nition of being disabled. If you’re claiming the disability tax 
credit for the first time you need to paper-file your tax return 
and include form T2201, “Disability Tax Credit Certificate,” 
signed by the appropriate heath care practitioner, attesting to 
your disability.
 
✓ Tax shelters. If you’ve made investments in flow-through 
shares, limited partnerships, or others that allow special tax 
deductions it’s common to be asked to provide evidence of 
your investment.
If you can’t get the information within the time limit, call the 
number on the request and ask for an extension. In most cases, 
a further 30 days will be granted. This extension is usually a one-
shot deal, however, and will not be granted a second time.
The Consequences of Not 
Replying to the CRA
The worst thing to do if you receive a request for additional infor-
mation is to ignore it. Ignoring the CRA will not make your problem 
magically disappear. If you don’t provide the information in the 
time allowed, or if you do not make suitable arrangements for an 
extension, the auditor will simply conclude the information does 

 #12: Respond Promptly to Requests from the CRA for Information 53
not exist and have your tax return assessed without the respective 
item — no childcare expense deduction or no RRSP deduction, or 
no deduction for your tax-shelter investment . . . The assessment 
can result in tax owing, plus interest.
For more serious situations, where a substantial amount of money is 
involved or potential criminal activities are suspected, the CRA can 
invoke a requirement or a judicial authorization forcing you to pro-
vide information. The Income Tax Act gives it the authority to do so.

Avoid Interest and Penalties
You know about the importance of April 30 on the calendar — 
it’s the due date for taxes to be paid. If you’re late, interest — 
and the dreaded interest-on-interest — starts to be added to your 
tax bill.
The due date for tax to be paid is still April 30 when you or your 
spouse are self-employed. Even though your return doesn’t need 
to be filed before June 15, the tax is owed on April 30. We discuss 
due dates for tax returns in this tip under the (ominous-sounding) 
heading “Late-filing penalty.”
The CRA may have requested that you pay your taxes quarterly by 
instalments. If your final tax bill is greater than the instalments you 
made, the remaining amount is due April 30. See Tip #14 for more 
on paying tax by instalments.
Penalties can be assessed in addition to the interest assessed on 
late or deficient taxes. Interest is also assessed on unpaid penal-
ties. So, you can have interest charged on outstanding taxes, 
interest charged on outstanding interest, and interest charged 
on outstanding penalties. Wow! Also, none of this interest is tax 
deductible. 
Interest and penalties are not the cheeriest topics to read about. 
It’s important that you know about them so you don’t get caught 
owing big bucks to the CRA.
Take Steps to Avoid Interest
Pay your tax by April 30 to avoid interest charges. Pay it by that 
date even if you’ll be filing your tax return late — make the best 
estimate of your tax and send it in. If you don’t have the money, it’s 
likely cheaper to borrow from a bank than to pay the high interest 
rate the CRA will charge.

 #13: Avoid Interest and Penalties 55
The CRA assesses interest based on tax owing on April 30. If you 
don’t owe any tax on April 30, whether or not you’ve filed your 
return, no interest will be assessed.
As we discuss in Tip #5, your tax bill is considered paid on the day 
it was mailed to the CRA if it’s sent by first-class mail or by courier. 
If you’re filing your tax return at the last minute, don’t drop it in 
just any old mail box. Ensure your return is postmarked on April 30 
so it will not be considered late. If the mail doesn’t get picked up 
until the next day, you’ll be stuck with a late-filed return! (Yes, pen-
alties exist for filing late. We discuss penalties later in this tip.)
If you have unpaid taxes for the current year, the CRA charges 
compounded daily interest starting on April 30. This applies 
to taxes owing per a Notice of Assessment (and Notice(s) of 
Reassessment), no matter the date of the assessment.
If you’re assessed or reassessed for additional 2009 taxes on, say, 
August 17, 2010, the interest would be calculated from the due date 
of April 30, 2010.
The CRA calculates interest using its prescribed rates of interest. 
These rates are released quarterly and can be found on CRA’s Web 
site at www.cra-arc.gc.ca/tx/fq/ntrst_rts/menu-eng.
html. The interest rate CRA charges on taxes owing to it is always 
two full percentage points above what CRA will pay on refunds it 
may owe to you.
Interest charged by the CRA on unpaid taxes is never tax deductible.
Tax payment deadlines for the deceased
If you’re filing a tax return for an individual who has died during the year, any bal-
ance owing on his or her final personal tax return (sometimes referred to as a ter-
minal tax return) is payable on April 30 of the year following death, except when the 
death occurred in November or December. In this case, the final tax liability — and 
the tax return — are not due until six months after death. If death occurs in January 
to April, payment for the prior year’s return is due six months following death. For 
example, if George died on February 1, 2010, his 2009 tax bill would not be due until 
August 1, 2010. Any tax liability for 2010 would be due April 30, 2011.

Part I: Tips for Everyone  
56
Don’t Be Sent to the Penalty Box
As though paying interest on taxes owing if you’re late weren’t 
enough, the CRA has penalties in store for you if you’re late in 
filing your tax return, or if you commit more serious tax offences. 
This section can scare anyone straight!
Late-filing penalty
If you file your return late — after April 30, or perhaps June 15 if 
you or your spouse are self-employed — a penalty of 5 percent of 
the tax owing will be added to your tax assessment. A further penalty 
of 1 percent of the unpaid tax will also be added for each full month 
the return is late, up to a maximum of 12 months, so, there can be an 
additional 12 percent penalty added. In total, a 17 percent penalty is 
possible!
If you’re late a second time within three years of the first late penalty, 
the penalty is bumped to 10 percent of the unpaid tax plus 2 percent 
per month, to a maximum of 20 months so, there can be an additional 
40 percent penalty. This can bring the total penalty to 50 percent of 
the unpaid tax! Pretty steep!
Waiving penalties goodbye
Paying tax penalties is not the best use of your hard-earned money. In addition to 
the comments above on avoiding penalties, you may be able to “get out of” some 
penalties.
Need to “come clean” with the CRA? If you have unreported income or unfiled tax 
returns a voluntary disclosure can help you. To avoid penalties and prosecution, 
you can voluntarily come forward to the CRA and provide all the missing informa-
tion. The CRA will waive penalties if you tell it before it catches you. You remain 
responsible for the tax and the interest.
Where extenuating circumstances have led to a situation where you were assessed 
penalties, the CRA has the ability to waive the penalties under the Taxpayer Relief 
provisions of the Income Tax Act. To request a review of your circumstances note 
the details on form RC4288, “Request for Taxpayer Relief”, and send it to the CRA. 
The form needs to include all the facts and reasons why the taxpayer relief provi-
sions should be applied in your situation. Read Information Circular IC07-1 before 
making your taxpayer relief request!

 #13: Avoid Interest and Penalties 57
Even if you cannot pay your tax on time, make sure you file your 
return on time to avoid the late-filing penalties. (You’ll be assessed 
interest on the tax owing but no late-filing penalty.)
Repeated failure to report income
If you have failed to report income, and this has been reassessed 
by the CRA, any subsequent failure to report income within the 
next three years will earn you a penalty of 10 percent of the unre-
ported income.
If you do have unreported income — and the CRA does not yet know 
about it — you may wish to make a voluntary disclosure to the CRA 
to avoid penalties being assessed. You’re still on the hook for the tax 
and interest, however. (We talk about voluntary disclosures earlier.)
Failure to provide complete 
information
If you fail to provide complete information, you’ll face a fine of $100 
per occurrence. Some examples include not providing a social 
insurance number on your return or omitting information the CRA 
requires to correctly assess your return. Complete all the informa-
tion asked for on your return and avoid the hassle — and the 
fine — from the CRA.
If the information you need had to be obtained from a third party 
and this person (or company) would not cooperate, the CRA can 
waive your penalty. Attach a note to your tax return outlining the 
steps you took to try to obtain the information.
Tax evasion, gross negligence, 
and false statements
For serious situations where taxpayers intentionally try to misstate 
or misrepresent their returns, a penalty of 50 percent of the tax 
avoided will be added to their tax liability.

Part I: Tips for Everyone  
58
Criminal prosecutions
Tax evasion usually involves a criminal prosecution in addition to 
the above penalties. The courts can impose fines of up to 200 
percent of the tax evaded and sentence you to five years in prison.
In one case, an individual was fined $36,000 after pleading guilty to 
two counts of tax evasion. The fine represented 120 percent of the 
amount of federal tax the individual was trying to evade! In addition
 to the fines, the individual was required to pay (obviously) the 
full amount of taxes owing, plus interest and penalties for a total of 
$214,000.

Pay Your Tax by Instalments
M
ost us think of April 30 as the “drop dead” date to pay our 
taxes, but many individuals have the pleasure of paying 
their taxes year-round! Taxpayers who earn income that is not sub-
ject to a withholding tax, and who earn sufficient amounts of this 
income to regularly create a tax liability, are asked by the CRA to 
pay their taxes throughout the year instead of just at April 30. CRA 
will ask you to pay by instalments in the current year if your tax 
owing on the previous year’s tax return, and in either of the two 
years prior to that, was greater than $3,000. (If you’re a resident of 
Quebec, the amount is $1,800.)
The instalment due dates are quarterly — March 15, June 15, 
September 15, and December 15. Any tax still owed is due on April 
30 of the following year.
Wait for an Instalment 
Request from the CRA
If you’re to pay your tax by making instalments, the CRA will send 
you a request. The request will include a remittance form (with 
the dollar amount of the requested instalment indicated) and an 
envelope to send the form — and cheque — to the CRA. (The CRA 
is very efficient in asking for money!)
Don’t worry about calculating and sending in tax instalments 
unless you receive a request from the CRA. If you don’t receive an 
instalment request, your total tax liability is not due until April 30 
of the following year.
The CRA calculates the instalment amounts based on a combination 
of your actual taxes payable in the two previous years. The March 
15 and June 15 instalments are calculated as one-quarter of your 
total tax payable for the year before last. The September 15 and 
December 15 instalments, when added to the instalments already 
made, are set to equal your total taxes payable in the prior year. 
(Yes, it is a little cumbersome.)

Part I: Tips for Everyone  
60
You can save yourself some cheque writing time if you allow pre-
authorized payment of the requested CRA instalments from your 
bank account. This can be done through My Account (Tip #8) or 
by sending the CRA a completed form T1162A, “Pre-Authorized 
Payment Plan (Personal Quarterly Instalment Payments).”
Usually the first time the CRA sends an instalment request to an 
individual the request is made in late August for instalments on 
September 15 and December 15. Note that the instalment amount 
requested for each date will be one-half (not one-quarter) of the 
previous year’s tax bill.
Paying instalments that differ from 
amounts requested by the CRA
If you expect your tax liability for the current year to be lower than 
in the previous year you can calculate and make an instalment 
amount lower than that requested by the CRA. In fact, if you expect 
that no need to make tax instalments for the current year exists 
you can choose to simply ignore the CRA instalment requests.
Beware if any of your instalment estimates are too low, or if you do 
not make instalments when you should be — the CRA will charge 
interest on the amount the instalment was deficient calculated 
from the due date of the instalment to whenever the amount is 
paid. So, be conservative in making your instalment estimates.
You can estimate your instalment payments in two ways: 
 
✓ Take the amount you think you will owe for the current year 
and pay one-quarter of that on each payment date.
 
✓ Take the balance of tax owed on the previous year’s tax 
return and pay one-quarter of the amount on each of the 
quarterly instalment due dates. The CRA will not charge you 
interest should a tax liability still exist when your return is 
completed and you make you final payment no later than 
April 30 of the following year.
As noted above, you can have the CRA withdraw your instalments 
directly from your bank account. This can be done even if you’re 
paying an amount different from what the CRA is requesting. 
Simply provide the CRA with the amounts.

Change Your Return 
After You Have Filed
I
f you think you’ve forgotten or omitted information on your 
filed tax return, or if you discover new information that per-
tains to a previously assessed tax return, the CRA will allow you to 
submit this information late.
As you can imagine, this is a common problem. But don’t worry — 
you can change or add information to both soon-to-be-assessed 
and already-assessed returns.
Changing Your Return Before 
It Has Been Assessed
We’ve found it’s best to fix or change or correct a tax return after it 
has been assessed. Actually, if you attempt to change a tax return 
after it’s filed (but not yet assessed), the return is still likely to be 
assessed first as it was filed without the changes you’ve requested. 
If the change to your tax return will cause an increase to your tax 
liability, remit the estimated tax resulting from the change immedi-
ately to avoid (or at least minimize) any interest charges that may 
apply as a result of the change.
Changing Your Return After 
It Has Been Assessed
The process for making a change to a tax return is as follows
 
✓ Do not file another return
 
✓ Inform the CRA of your changes
 
• by mail or
 
• via the Internet

Part I: Tips for Everyone  
62
Making changes by mail: Using 
Form T1ADJ “T1 Adjustment 
Request”
The “T1” reference is to the form number for a personal tax return. 
Form T1 is an individual’s “Income Tax and Benefit Return.” We 
know you wanted to know that.
To tell the CRA of your changes by mail, 
 
✓ Complete form T1ADJ, “T1 Adjustment Request,” available at 
all the CRA Tax Services Offices (and on the CRA Web site, www.
cra-arc.gc.ca), or write a letter detailing the changes 
including the years involved, the specific details, your address 
and social insurance number, and your home and daytime 
phone numbers. Sign and date the form or letter.
 
✓ Provide all supporting documents for the requested changes.
 
✓ Send the adjustment request to the CRA Tax Centre where 
you filed your return.
Making changes via the Internet
To make a change using the internet, set up My Account on the 
CRA Web site (see Tip #8), and choose the “Change my return” 
option. You can make changes online for this year’s tax return 
or for the two previous years’ returns. Otherwise, you’ll have to 
follow the mail route.
CRA’s response to your 
change request
After the CRA has reviewed your requested changes it will do one 
of three things:
 
✓ Accept your changes and send you a Notice of Reassessment 
(or Notice of Assessment if the return had not yet been 
assessed).
 
✓ Deny your request. A letter will explain the reasons.
 
✓ Request additional information.

Tips for Employees and 
Business Owners

In this part . . .
I
f you’re like many Canadians, much of your time is 
spent at work. Among us are farmers and bankers and 
teachers and bus drivers and tax accountants, plus occu-
pations that many of us have yet to imagine. But the one 
thing that we all have in common is that we work to get 
paid so that we have income to enjoy the rest of our lives. 
In this part, we offer tips to help you hold on to as much of 
that income as possible, whether you’re an employee or a 
business owner.
Employees are very limited in the expenses they can 
deduct when calculating the tax they owe to the CRA and 
therefore much to the chagrin of many Canadians, employ-
ment income is where we pay the bulk of our taxes. But 
don’t despair — with some planning and a better under-
standing of how the CRA views employment income, you 
just might end up with a few more dollars in your pocket

As for you business owners, running a small business is no 
“small” feat. Issues arise continually that need your attention —
customers, manufacturing, marketing, sales, labour relations, 
and so on. And then there are the taxes. As we delve into 
Tips #28–33 of this part, we tackle many tax issues that a 
small business owner must face. Tons of these issues can 
lead to positive tax planning opportunities in terms of 
maximizing after-tax income for you and your family.

Determine Whether You’re 
Self-Employed or an 
Employee
A
re you your own boss? Consider this yet another question 
from the CRA. Of course we’d all like to think we’re our own 
boss, but the CRA wants to know specifically whether you’re self-
employed or an employee. For many people the answer is simple, 
but for others it’s not so obvious. The CRA makes the distinction 
between self-employed and employed based on several factors or 
tests — and the distinction can make a huge difference in your tax-
able income. If you’re an employee, the Income Tax Act restricts 
the expenses you can deduct from your employment income. 
Basically, if a deduction isn’t specifically mentioned in the Act, it’s 
not deductible. Self-employed individuals don’t have these same 
restrictions.
The Ups and Downs of 
Self-Employment
In most situations it’s advantageous to arrange your business 
relationships so that you’re an independent contractor (self-
employed) rather than an employee. This is because independent 
contractors are entitled to claim deductions for many expenses 
not deductible by an employee.
 
That all sounds nice, sure, but be aware that self-employment 
comes with its own pitfalls. As a self-employed person you’ll be 
responsible for paying the employer’s share of Canada Pension 
Plan (CPP) contributions, which doubles your overall contribu-
tion. As well, before leaping at the opportunity to become your 
own boss, remember this: If your business venture fails, there will 
be no Employment Insurance (EI) or severance waiting for you. 
And, of course, you won’t be entitled to any employment benefits 
such as medical or dental coverage. You also may have difficulty 
getting credit, as your income stream likely won’t be predictable, 

Part II: Tips for Employees and Business Owners

and you’ll be responsible for all the recordkeeping and income and 
sales tax compliance for your business. Self-employment can be 
great, but it’s not all sunshine and roses!
Determining Whether You’re 
Self-Employed
Table 2-1 illustrates the factors the CRA considers in its determina-
tion of whether you’re self-employed or an employee. The tests in 
this table don’t necessarily yield automatic answers, but they do 
provide the framework for the taxman’s assessments.

Improving Your Chances of Being 
Considered Self-Employed
Keeping the tests from Table 2-1 in mind, you can do a number of 
things to improve the likelihood you’ll be considered an indepen-
dent contractor in the CRA’s eyes. When you’re self-employed, be 
sure to: 
 
✓ Document your business arrangement with your client in a 
contract 
 
✓ Use your own equipment 
 
✓ Send invoices to your client
 
✓ Refuse to accept fringe benefits 
 
✓ Work for more than one client 
 
✓ Establish yourself as a business — register your business 
name, set up an office, get business cards, advertise, and get a 
separate phone line
 
The CRA’s guide entitled Employee or Self-Employed? (RC4110) 
identifies the factors that determine your status. You can find the 
guide under “Forms and publications” on the CRA Web site (www.

Save for Your Retirement
W
e know, we know — you’d rather hear about Aunt Petunia’s 
bunions than the importance of saving for retirement. 
Many Canadians avoid thinking about it for so long that when 
retirement looms they suddenly realize they won’t have enough 
saved to maintain their current lifestyle. We don’t want this to 
happen to you, so listen up!
For most people, making use of the retirement savings plans avail-
able to them is crucial to saving enough for retirement. In this tip 
we address the different types of plans available to employees.
Understanding Your Registered 
Pension Plan
Registered pension plans (RPPs) are set up by employers or unions 
to assist employees in saving for retirement; they’re designed to 
minimize taxes now to provide for maximum amounts available 
when the funds are needed during retirement. 
If you have an RPP, consider yourself lucky. In this day and age 
only about a third of employees are covered by such a plan. The 
best thing about RPPs is that your employer has to help you save 
for retirement by contributing to the plan. The contributions you 
make to an RPP are tax deductible and the income you earn on 
the money you invest accumulates tax free. You’ll pay tax on the 
money saved in an RPP only when you begin receiving it as pen-
sion income in retirement. How great is that?
You can get money into your RPP by
 
✓ Contributing funds through deductions from your salary
 
✓ Your employer contributing funds
 
✓ Earning money on the savings in your RPP
 
✓ Transferring funds from another retirement account into your 
RPP

69
 #17: Save for Your Retirement
Two types of RPPs exist:
 
✓ Defined benefit plans, which are based on a formula that 
includes employment earnings and years of service.
 
✓ Money purchase plans, which depend on the amount you con-
tribute and the earnings on those contributions.
Defined benefit plans
The majority of Canadians with an RPP are employed by large com-
panies or the government. If you belong to this type of plan you’re 
entitled to a fixed annual income from the plan on retirement. 
You’ll continue receiving payments during your life, and your 
former employer must ensure the pension is sufficiently funded to 
make those payments to you. 
With a defined benefit plan you can deduct all the contributions 
you’ve made for service to your employer after 1989. You can also 
deduct up to $3,500 in respect of past-service contributions for a 
year before 1990 in which you were not contributing to any RPP.
Money purchase plans
If you belong to this type of plan your pension benefit is deter-
mined by adding up the contributions you’ve made to the plan 
over the years and the income you’ve earned on those savings. 
Your employer must contribute at least one percent of your salary 
to your plan — more is better! The amount you’re entitled to on 
retirement depends on the total amount you save by retirement. In 
this case your contribution is fixed but your payment is not. These 
are also known as defined contribution plans.
For a money purchase plan the 2009 combined contribution that 
both you and your employer can make is the lesser of 18 percent of 
your earned income from the previous year and $22,000. Beginning 
in 2010 the amount you can contribute will be indexed to inflation. 
You can’t make past-service contributions to this type of RPP (we 
define past-service contributions under “Buying Back Service” in 
this Tip).
 
Many employers will match the contributions you make based on a 
formula. If your employer matches contributions, make sure you  
contribute the amount required to get the entire employer match —
if your employer wants to share, we say let him!

Knowing What to Do with 
a Pension Adjustment
As the value of your RPP increases, the amount you can contribute 
to your registered retirement savings plan (RRSP) decreases. The 
pension adjustment (PA) is a component of the calculation of your 
RRSP deduction limit. The idea behind the PA is that an individual 
who is not a member of an RPP can use only the RRSP to save for 
retirement. To keep things fair for all Canadians, the amount an 
RPP member can contribute to an RRSP is reduced by his or her 
PA. The pension adjustment reported on your current-year T4 will 
reduce the next year’s RRSP deduction limit on a dollar-for-dollar 
basis. (See Tip #42 for a detailed discussion on RRSPs.)
 
When you receive your notice of assessment from the CRA after 
filing your tax return, you’ll see that the current year’s PA amount 
you disclosed when filing your tax return is included in the formula 
to calculate the next year’s RRSP deduction limit. This is an impor-
tant piece of paper to have around when it comes time to make 
the next year’s contribution, because you face penalties when you 
overcontribute to your RRSP by more than $2,000.
Knowing What to Do with a 
Pension Adjustment Reversal
A pension adjustment reversal (PAR) often arises when you leave 
an employer where you were a member of the company pension 
plan. The PAR is essentially a statement that shows that the pen-
sion adjustments (PA) reported on your T4s over the years were 
too high — this means your pension adjustments were overstated, 
so your RRSP deduction limits were understated. The PAR simply 
corrects the understatement in your RRSP deduction limit. In fact, 
a PAR indicates your RRSP deduction limit is being increased — 
this is good news!
 
Your employer must send you a T10 slip to report your PAR to you 
within 60 days after the end of the calendar-year quarter in which 
you left your job. (So, if you left your job in the final quarter, you 
should receive your T10 slip by January 30.)

 #17: Save for Your Retirement
Buying Back Service
Contributions to your pension plan for past services are consid-
ered past-service contributions, meaning the contributions were 
made for work you did in prior years. The contributions, made by 
you, are generally made to upgrade the pension benefits you’ll be 
entitled to in the future. Past-service contributions are often made 
in a lump sum. You may hear people refer to past-service contribu-
tions as “buying back service,” or buying increased pension ben-
efits — paying some money now for an increased pension down 
the road.
 
Ask your pension plan administrator whether you’re entitled to 
buy back any service. Based on your age, your years to retirement, 
length of service, and the dollars involved, it can be beneficial in 
terms of your future pension entitlement to buy back service!
Contributions for 1990 
and later years
Your total contributions for current service and past service 
for 1990 and later years can usually be found in box 20 of the T4 
slips you received from your employer. The full amount is to be 
included on line 207 of your tax return.
Contributions for years before 1990
 
If your current and past-service contributions for 1990 and later 
years exceed $3,500, you’ll find that none of your past-service con-
tribution for years before 1990 is deductible on your current-year 
tax return. However, all is not lost! Those contributions become 
eligible for deduction in 2009 and subsequent years. The maxi-
mum total deduction is $3,500 per year or part year of service you 
bought back. So, if it costs you more than $3,500 to make a past-
service contribution for a particular pre-1990 year, you will not 
(ever) be entitled to deduct your full contribution. And if you buy 
back more than one year’s worth of pre-1990 service, even within 
the $3,500 maximum, you’ll have to spread the deduction over a 
number of years.

Knowing What to Do When 
You Leave Your Employer 
Before You Retire
Funds held in an RPP are locked in, meaning if you leave your 
employer before you retire you can’t simply have them paid to you 
in a lump sum. These funds must be used to provide you with a 
lifetime retirement income.
You generally have three options when you leave:
 
✓ Roll your existing pension into your new employer’s pension.
 
✓ Leave it where it is and take your pension from that company 
when you retire.
 
✓ Transfer your money into a locked-in retirement account 
(LIRA). You can’t draw an income from your LIRA until you 
reach the age of 50. At that point you can convert your LIRA 
into a locked-in retirement fund (LRIF) or an annuity and begin 
receiving the pension income (see Tip #43 for more details).
Contributing to Your Employer’s 
Profit-Sharing Plan
We offer one final word on saving for retirement when you’re an 
employee: If your employer has a deferred profit sharing plan, oth-
erwise known as a DPSP, you’ll want to participate.
DPSPs are set up by employers for their employees, and employ-
ers contribute to them based on the profitability of the company. 
When you save money in a DPSP, it’s tax sheltered in the same 
way it is in an RPP — the contributions made and income earned 
is sheltered from tax until you withdraw funds from the plan. On 
retirement you can transfer the funds to an RRSP or an RRIF, or 
you can use the funds to purchase an annuity (see Tip #43).

Take Advantage of Employee 
and Shareholder Loans
I
n certain situations — say, when the 14 year old car that Aunt 
Mable gave you decides it doesn’t want to start again (ever) , 
or maybe instead you decide you want to move closer to the office 
where houses are more expensive so you can spend more time 
working and less time commuting (yah right!) — you might be able 
to convince your employer to make you a loan interest free. A loan 
made by a corporation to an employee who is not a shareholder of 
the corporation (or related to a shareholder of the corporation) is 
not included in the employee’s income.
Hold on, hold on, we can hear you cheering from here. The 
employee does not fully escape tax! She is considered to have 
received an imputed interest benefit — a rather stuffy term that we 
clarify for you later in this tip as we consider the tax implications 
of employee loans.
Working with Employee and 
Shareholder Loans
If you receive a no-interest or low-interest loan because you own 
shares or because of your past, present, or future employment 
(how’s that for a catch-all!), and the loan was not included in 
your income by virtue of the exceptions detailed earlier, you’ll be 
considered to have received a taxable benefit referred to as an 
imputed or deemed interest benefit. This benefit is equal to the dif-
ference between the interest paid in the year (or within 30 days 
after the year-end), if any, and the interest determined by the CRA 
using its prescribed rates of interest. Still sound scary? All this 
technical jargon means is you pay tax on the difference between 
the interest rate set by CRA (prescribed rate) and the rate that you 
are actually charged by your employer if your employer’s rate is 
lower.

Part II: Tips for Employees and Business Owners  
74
 
CRA’s prescribed interest rates are updated every three months 
and can be found on the CRA Web site at http://www.cra-arc.
gc.ca/tx/fq/ntrst-rts/menu-eng.html?=slnk. The rate 
was 2 percent for the first quarter of 2009, and 1 percent for the 
last three quarters.
If the loan was made by virtue of your employment, the imputed 
interest benefit is considered employment income, and the amount 
is included in your T4.
Say Duncan receives a non-interest-bearing loan from his employer 
for $100,000 at the beginning of the year. Duncan is not a share-
holder, and the loan is outstanding until the end of the year. Using 
a prescribed rate of 2 percent for the first quarter of the year and 1 
percent for the other three quarters, what is Duncan’s interest ben-
efit? Duncan will be deemed to have an interest benefit of $1,250 
($100,000 times 2 percent × 1⁄4 plus $100,000 times 1 percent × 3⁄4). 
This amount will be added to Duncan’s employment income for the 
year and included on his T4. Any interest Duncan paid on this loan 
during the year (or the first 30 days of the next year) would reduce 
the imputed interest benefit.
 
If you receive a loan from your employer and are required to pay 
interest on the loan, try to arrange to pay the interest portion on 
January 30 (not 31) of the following year. This will let you keep 
your cash as long as possible and still reduce or eliminate the 
deemed interest benefit for the current year.
Exploring the controversy 
over employer loans
Employee loans have been the focus of numerous court challenges and legisla-
tive changes over the years. The primary concern the government has with these 
arrangements is that they could be used as a way for corporations to distribute all 
their profit and retained earnings to shareholders and employees on a totally tax-
free basis. By extending no-interest indefinite loans, the corporations could give 
you all the money you wanted with no tax implications to you or the corporation.
Banning these loans altogether is not the answer. The government recognizes that, 
in certain situations, loans from a corporation to an employee or shareholder are 
necessary — so corporations are allowed to extend loans in certain situations, but 
with very restrictive rules.

75
 #18: Take Advantage of Employee and Shareholder Loans
 
Where possible, convince your employer to make your loan inter-
est free. You will have an imputed interest benefit added to your 
employment income, but the tax cost of a benefit is cheaper than 
actually paying interest. For example, at a marginal tax rate of 40 
percent, a 1 percent deemed interest benefit costs you only 0.4 
percent (1 percent benefit times 40 percent tax rate = 0.4 percent 
in tax payable). Effectively, you have a 0.4 percent loan — cheaper 
than actually paying interest at 1 percent and certainly cheaper 
than what you would get from a bank!
 
When a shareholder or employee loan or debt is forgiven, the for-
given amount is a taxable benefit and is added to the income of the 
shareholder or employee.
Recognizing Special Circumstances
Employee loans for the purchase or relocation of a home are given 
special treatment when it comes to calculating the imputed inter-
est benefit.
 
✓ Home purchase loans: Where the loan is made to you as an 
employee home purchase loan, the interest rate used to cal-
culate the imputed interest benefit for the first five years will 
never be greater than the CRA-prescribed interest rate at the 
time the loan was made. (However, you can take advantage of 
a lower imputed interest benefit should the prescribed rates 
decrease!) When the five years are over, the continuation of 
the loan is considered a new loan, and the prescribed rate in 
effect on that day will be the maximum rate charged for the 
next five years. For example, Maureen receives an interest-
free employee home purchase loan on September 9, 2009. On 
that date, the CRA-prescribed interest rate was 1 percent. 
Over the next five years, Maureen’s taxable benefit will be 
calculated using a prescribed rate that could be less than 1 
percent but will never be more.
 
✓ Home relocation loans: When the loan is an employee home 
relocation loan — that is, a loan to help you purchase a home 
that is at least 40 kilometres closer to a new work location — 
you receive a special deduction in the calculation of the inter-
est benefit.
 
Consider renegotiating your home purchase loan with your 
employer when prescribed interests rates are low in order to mini-
mize your taxable benefit in subsequent years.

Part II: Tips for Employees and Business Owners  
76
Employee home relocation 
loan deductions
The home relocation deduction is one deduction that you’ll know 
you’re entitled to claim. Why? Because it shows up right on the T4 
slip you receive from your employer. When an amount is entered 
in box 37 of your T4 slip, you can claim a deduction for your 
employee home relocation loan.
So what qualifies as a home relocation loan? Unfortunately, a loan 
to allow you to move down the street because you want a view of 
the lake does not qualify. A home relocation loan is a loan your 
employer gives you, usually at a zero or low interest rate, to help 
you move for business reasons. Generally, this means you’re 
changing jobs and your new employer is helping you out with a 
loan, or your current employer is transferring you to a new loca-
tion.
To qualify for the employee home relocation loan deduction, all 
the following must apply:
 
✓ The loan must be received by an employee (or the employee’s 
spouse).
 
✓ The employee must be moving at least 40 kilometres from his 
old residence in Canada.
 
✓ The employee must commence work in a new location in 
Canada.
 
✓ The loan must be used to acquire a new residence.
When you receive a home relocation loan, the amount received is 
not included in your T4 slip. However, an amount representing the 
“interest benefit” you have enjoyed (by not paying the interest!) 
is included in your T4 slip. Your employer has to report the inter-
est benefit on all loans given to you when the interest rate you are 
paying (if any) is less than the CRA’s prescribed interest rate.
 
The rate that should be used to calculate your taxable benefit 
is the prescribed rate in effect when your employee loan was 
granted. However, if the rate subsequently drops, you can start 
using this new lower rate. If the rate increases, you can continue 
to use the rate in effect at the time the loan was received. In other 
words, you’re protected from rate increases after you receive the 
loan, and you benefit from lower rates. This protection lasts for 
five years, as a new loan is considered to be granted every five 
years. So, let’s say you received a $20,000 loan at the end of last 
year when the CRA’s prescribed rate was 3 percent. If the rate sub-
sequently increases to 4 percent again, provided you’re paying 3 

77
 #18: Take Advantage of Employee and Shareholder Loans
percent interest on the loan you won’t have to report any interest 
benefit in your income. However, if your loan is still outstanding 
five years from the date the loan was granted and at that time the 
prescribed interest rate is 6 percent, you’ll have to start paying 6 
percent in order to avoid having any interest benefit included in 
your income.
 
If you’re required to pay at least the CRA’s prescribed interest rate on 
your employee loan, you don’t need to calculate a taxable benefit.
Now for the good part: the deduction! When an interest benefit is 
included in your income for an employee home relocation loan, 
and you meet the criteria above, you can claim a full or partial 
deduction from your income.
 
Your deduction is the lesser of the following:
 
✓ The interest benefit (which is included in your income)
 
✓ The amount of interest benefit that would have been com-
puted if the home relocation loan had been $25,000
In friendlier terms, imagine you received a $20,000 interest-free 
loan from your employer when the prescribed interest rate was 4 
percent, and this loan meets the definition of a home relocation 
loan. So, your deduction will be the lesser of $800 ($20,000 × 4 
percent) and $1,000 ($25,000 × 4 percent). In this case, your entire 
taxable benefit of $800 will be offset by the deduction. Just to keep 
it interesting, another rule applies to employee home relocation 
loans. You see, the deduction does not last forever. It’s applicable 
only for a maximum of five years from the day the loan was origi-
nally granted, or until the loan is actually paid off, whichever is 
shorter.
 
In negotiating your compensation for a new job that will require 
moving at least 40 kilometres, ask for a $25,000 home relocation 
loan. Due to the deduction for the interest benefit on the first 
$25,000 of a home relocation loan, you effectively receive the loan 
tax free for five years.
Loans made to a shareholder who is 
not an employee of the corporation
Generally, all loans to shareholders or persons related to a share-
holder are included in the income of the shareholder or the related 
person in the year the loan was made. The same rules apply when 
a shareholder (or person related to a shareholder) becomes 
indebted to a corporation in some manner — for example, when 

Part II: Tips for Employees and Business Owners  
78
a shareholder buys a vehicle from the corporation and pays for 
it with a promissory note. Of course, this being a tax, exceptions 
apply to this general rule.
Shareholder loans are not included in income of the shareholder 
when
 
✓ The loan is made in the ordinary course of the business of 
loaning money, provided that bona fide repayment arrange-
ments are made at the time of the loan. For example, banks 
and other financial institutions can make loans to sharehold-
ers without the shareholder being concerned that the loan 
will be included in their taxable income, because a bank is in 
the business of loaning money to begin with.
 
✓ The loan is repaid within one year from the end of the corpo-
ration’s taxation year in which the loan was made. For exam-
ple, if the loan is made in 2009 and the corporation’s year-end 
is December 31, 2009, the loan must be repaid by December 
31, 2010, to avoid the entire amount of the loan being included 
in the shareholder’s 2009 income.
 
The loan cannot be part of a series of loans and repayments. This 
means you, as a shareholder, can’t repay the loan, then take out 
another loan — in theory, you really haven’t paid back the original 
amount. The tax laws state that when you use this strategy you’re 
required to report the amount of the loan in income.
Loans made to a shareholder who is 
also an employee of the corporation
When a shareholder is also an employee of the corporation making 
the loan, further exceptions to the general income inclusion rules 
discussed earlier apply. The shareholder/employee can avoid an 
income inclusion if the loan was made in any of these specific cir-
cumstances:
 
✓ The loan is made to an employee who is not a “specified 
employee” — that is, an employee who owns fewer than 10 
percent of the shares of the corporation.
 
✓ The loan was made to an employee to acquire a home for 
occupation.
 
✓ The loan was made to an employee to purchase shares of the 
employer corporation from the corporation itself — not from 
another shareholder.
 
✓ The loan was made to an employee to acquire an automobile 
needed to perform duties of employment.

79
 #18: Take Advantage of Employee and Shareholder Loans
For the shareholder/employee to take advantage of these excep-
tions, two additional conditions must also be met:
 
✓ The loan arose because of the employee’s employment and 
not because of shareholdings. In simpler terms, the loan must 
be available to all employees, or at least all employees of a 
particular class (for example, management), not just share-
holding employees.
 
✓ Bona fide repayment terms must be in place. An agreement 
must be in place for the loan to be repaid within a reasonable 
period of time.
For corporations where a significant shareholder is also the day-
to-day manager of the corporation’s activities, it can be difficult 
to prove that the loan was made because the person was an 
employee, not a shareholder. The CRA has said that loans made 
to a person will be considered as being made by virtue of his or 
her shareholdings where the shareholder can significantly influ-
ence business policy. Nevertheless, an employee/shareholder may 
be able to have the loan excluded from income if he or she can 
establish that other employees who perform similar duties and 
responsibilities for a similar-sized employer — but who are not 
shareholders in that employer-corporation — received loans or 
other indebtedness of similar amounts under similar conditions. 
It’s a tough one, but not impossible depending on the circum-
stances.

Understand Your Stock 
Options
H
ave you been granted stock options by your employer? Then 
this tip is for you! Stock options are one of the most popular 
forms of non-monetary compensation offered by employers today. 
But make no mistake about it — they are a taxable benefit and 
should be included in your total employment income reported on 
box 14 of your T4 slip. In this tip we offer a brief synopsis of the 
rules.
Checking Out the General Rule
Special rules exist when a corporation agrees to sell or issue 
shares to an employee as part of a compensation package. 
Basically, the employee is given an option to buy stock (also 
referred to as shares) of a company for an agreed-upon price at 
a future point in time. When given this option, the employee has 
nothing to report in income. 
The general rule is that the taxable benefit comes into play when 
the option is exercised — or when you state that “Yes, I would 
like to purchase the stock now.” When the option is exercised, the 
benefit included in your income is the difference between the fair 
market value of the shares on the date you exercised your option 
and the price you paid for the option and the shares.
Investigating the Exceptions
The general rule we cover in the previous section was pretty 
straightforward, right? Of course, it wouldn’t be a “general tax 
rule” without exceptions. Exceptions occur when the option is 
given to buy shares of a publicly traded company or shares of a 
Canadian-controlled private corporation. We take a closer look at 
these rules in this section.

 #19: Understand Your Stock Options
Public-company shares
In the past, when you exercised your stock options, you were con-
sidered to have received a taxable benefit equal to the difference 
between the market value of the shares on the day you exercised 
your options and your actual cost. Simple enough, but luckily for 
some this is no longer the case. You see, when you’re taxed upon 
exercise of the option, you haven’t necessarily sold the underly-
ing stock yet — and therefore may have no cash to pay tax on the 
benefit! Fortunately, if you have a stock option in a publicly traded 
company, you may now be able to postpone the taxation of qualify-
ing employee stock options to when the shares are sold, instead of 
when the option is exercised.
 
Unfortunately, the rules don’t end there. Even if you don’t sell your 
shares in the same year you exercise your option, you may not be 
allowed to postpone the entire income inclusion. To complicate 
matters, the maximum benefit that can be deferred is $100,000 per 
vesting year. (Vesting year just means the year you earned the 
right to or are entitled to the options.) This $100,000 is based on 
the value of the underlying shares when the option was granted to 
you. The option price doesn’t matter — it’s the value of the under-
lying shares that’s used to calculate the $100,000 limit.
For example, say you were granted the option to purchase 100,000 
shares of your employer corporation, at a price of $2 per share, 
in 2008. (Assume the shares were trading at $2 at the time the 
option was granted to you.) At the time you exercise your option, 
the shares are trading at $5. (If you’re quick at math, you realize 
you had a $3 benefit per share, so for 100,000 shares the benefit is 
$300,000.) If you exercise all your options this year, you will receive 
only a partial deferral of tax. At the time the options were granted 
to you, they were worth $200,000 (100,000 × $2). This means you’ll 
manage to defer taxes on only one-half of your options ($200,000 –
 $100,000 ÷ $2 per share = 50,000 options). Your taxable benefit 
this year will be $150,000 ($5 – $2 × 50,000 options), and the other 
$150,000 will be taxed only when you sell the shares ($150,000 taxed 
now, $150,000 taxed later, $300,000 taxed in total — as expected).
 
To take advantage of this deferral for options exercised in one year 
you must make an “election” with your employer before January 
15, of the following year. The election is simply a letter to your 
employer that must contain the following:
 
✓ A request for the deferral to apply
 
✓ The amount of the stock option benefit being deferred
 
✓ Confirmation that you were a resident in Canada when you 
purchased the shares

Part II: Tips for Employees and Business Owners  
82
 
✓ Confirmation that you have not exceeded the $100,000 annual 
limit
You need to inform your employer so that your T4 is prepared cor-
rectly. In addition to making this election, you must complete form 
T1212, “Statement of Deferred Stock Option Benefits,” and file it 
with your return every year you continue to have a deferred stock 
option benefit.
 
Wait until you want to sell your option shares before you go ahead 
and exercise your stock options. This will ensure you have the 
cash (from the sale of the shares) available to pay your tax bill. 
We’ve seen too many situations where Canadians exercised their 
stock options, accrued a huge tax bill, and then got stung because 
the shares dropped in value after the exercise date. Nothing in 
the Canadian tax laws remedies this situation, meaning you’ll still 
owe tax on the stock option benefit as of the date of exercise, even 
if the shares are worthless when they are actually sold. What’s 
more, the difference between the sale price and the exercise price 
is a capital loss (or a capital gain, if it goes up in value). Because 
capital losses can be used to offset only capital gains, and not any 
other type of income (such as the employment income a stock 
option benefit gives rise to), you may be stuck with a useless capi-
tal loss. Ouch!
Canadian-controlled private 
corporations
If your employer is a Canadian-controlled private corporation 
(CCPC), you’re in luck. When you exercise your stock options, you 
can defer all your taxable benefit until you actually sell the shares. 
The taxable benefit for CCPCs is calculated the same way as that 
for public companies: the market value of the shares on the date 
you exercise your option less your cost. By the way, your cost 
includes your exercise price (the amount you must pay for the 
shares under your option agreement) and amounts you paid (if 
any) to acquire the option itself.
 
The rules for CCPC stock options will apply provided your 
employer was a CCPC at the time the option was granted to you 
(not when the option is exercised). So, if your company goes 
public in the future, you can still benefit from the more favourable 
CCPC stock option rules.
 
Develop a strategy for managing your stock options when exer-
cising and selling that takes into account not only the tax conse-
quences but also the cash flow requirements and investment risk.

83
 #19: Understand Your Stock Options
Stock option deductions
Now to the part you really want to know about — the stock option 
deduction. This deduction is available because the taxable benefit 
you’ll be charged when you exercise your stock options is taxed as 
employment income (either this year or in a future year when you 
sell the stock). In other words, 100 percent of the benefit is tax-
able in your hands. To many people this seems unfair because the 
benefit is from a stock, which is normally treated as a capital item. 
As we discuss in Tip #38, capital gains are only one-half taxable, so 
you’re taxed a full one-half more by exercising an employee stock 
option rather than purchasing the share yourself on the open 
market and then selling it for a profit.
But don’t fret. Our tax laws understand this difference and allow 
a deduction, known as the stock option and shares deduction. 
The deduction is equal to one-half of the taxable benefit you must 
report. This means your stock option benefit will effectively be 
taxed in the same way as a capital gain would be.
Additional deduction for donated shares
An additional stock option deduction of 50 percent is available 
when you exercise a stock option and then donate the shares to 
a registered charity. This applies to all such donations on or after 
May 2, 2008. Yep, that’s right. You get a tax deduction for 100 per-
cent of your taxable benefit. You’ll also get a donation receipt for 
the full market value of your donation. To take advantage of this 
incentive, the shares must be donated to the charity within the 
year and within 30 days of the option being exercised. Note that 
when you donate such stocks to a registered charity, you report 
the disposition on form T1170, “Capital Gains on Gifts of Certain 
Capital Property,” and not on schedule 3 of your tax return.
Shares qualifying for the deduction
Like most good things, the stock option and share deduction is not 
available in every case. In order to qualify, some criteria must be 
met. (You didn’t think a tax law would exist without qualifications, 
did you?)
The stock option deduction is available when all the following con-
ditions are met:
 
✓ Your employer corporation, or a corporation that does not 
deal at arm’s length with the employer (a related company), 
must be the seller or issuer of the shares.
 
✓ The shares must be common shares of the corporation.

Part II: Tips for Employees and Business Owners  
84
 
✓ The exercise price of the option (that is, the amount you must 
pay to receive the share of your employer corporation — it’s 
sometimes called the strike price) must be at least equal 
to the market value of the share at the time the option was 
granted to you. If you’ve paid an amount to acquire the option 
itself, this amount can be added to the exercise price of the 
option. For example, if you’ve paid $2 to acquire the option to 
purchase a share of your employer, and subsequently pay $5 
to exercise the option, you’ll be eligible for the stock option 
deduction (assuming all other criteria are met) as long as the 
market value of the employer’s shares on the date the option 
was granted to you was at least $7 ($2 plus $5).
 
✓ You must be dealing at arm’s length with your employer. This 
means that if you control the corporation (that is, you own 
the majority of the voting shares), or are related to a person 
who controls the corporation, you won’t be eligible for this 
deduction.
 
Regulation 6204 of the Income Tax Act covers the entire list of 
criteria (good reading for anyone with insomnia).
 
If the option was granted to you while the corporation was a 
CCPC, you don’t necessarily have to worry about the above rules. 
You see, if you hold the shares you’ve acquired under your stock 
option agreement for at least two years, you’ll automatically qual-
ify for the stock option deduction. However, if you don’t hold the 
shares for two years, but meet the above criteria, you’ll still qual-
ify. (CCPC options are more flexible than public-company options 
in terms of the respective tax rules.)
Although these rules might sound fairly complex, fear not — it’s 
not up to you to determine whether you’re eligible for the deduc-
tion. Your employer should make this determination (we know, 
they have all the fun!), and your T4 slip for the year will indicate 
that your taxable employment benefit is in fact eligible for the 
“110(1)(d) or 110(1)(d.1) deduction.” (You guessed it — these are 
references to the Income Tax Act.) The amount eligible for the 
deduction is reported in either box 39 or box 41 of your T4 slip. If 
an amount shows up in these boxes, report it on line 249 of your 
tax return.
 
If you own shares of a CCPC under a stock option plan and the 
company is going public, you may be able to make a special elec-
tion for a deemed disposition of the shares to take advantage of 
the $750,000 capital gains exemption. We recommend you get pro-
fessional help if you think this may apply to you.

Don’t Be Surprised by Other 
Taxable Benefits
E
mployers — nice ones, anyway — sometimes provide other 
benefits for your work in addition to your paycheque. 
Generally, when you receive a benefit by virtue of your employ-
ment and it increases your net worth it will be taxable. In this tip, 
we cover what would be considered a taxable benefit, why they’re 
good for you and which ones to chase that nice boss for.
 
In times like these it may be easier to negotiate with your employer 
for a smaller salary increase and additional benefits instead of that 
significant salary increase you were hoping for.
Understanding the Benefit 
of a Taxable Benefit
Even though you may not be pleased that some perks your employer 
offers are taxable, a taxable benefit will usually be more financially 
advantageous than if you had to pay for the benefit yourself.
For example, if your employer pays group term life insurance pre-
miums of $4,000 for you annually, and you’re taxed on the amount 
at 40 percent, you’ll pay tax of only $1,600 — that’s much less 
expensive than having to pay the $4,000 premium out of your after-
tax income.
Looking at Common 
Taxable Benefits
After the interest benefit (Tip #18) and the stock option benefit 
(Tip #19), the following are some of the more common taxable ben-
efits that may show up on your T4 slip. We’ve also got some tips 
for using these benefits to your best advantage.

Part II: Tips for Employees and Business Owners  
86
 
✓ Car allowances: If your employer gives you an allowance 
to help defray the cost of your vehicle, ensure you receive 
a per-kilometre reimbursement. If you receive a lump-sum 
allowance that’s not based on a per-kilometre rate, you’ll 
find yourself with a taxable benefit. The good news is that 
even when the allowance is taxable, you may be entitled to 
deduct some of your auto expenses when you use your car for 
employment purposes. See Tip #22 for details.
 
✓ Company cars: If you’re provided with a company-owned 
or -leased car, you’ll pay tax on the benefit for having the car 
available for personal use (called a standby charge) — regard-
less of whether you use the car personally. In addition, if your 
employer pays for operating costs (such as gas, insurance, or 
maintenance), you’ll pay tax on this benefit (referred to as an 
operating benefit) to the extent the car was used for personal 
purposes.
 
Think twice about accepting a company car as part of your com-
pensation. You’ll be required to pay tax on two separate benefits: 
the standby charge (which can be 24 percent of the cost of your 
car each year or two-thirds the annual lease costs!) and an operat-
ing benefit (24¢ per personal kilometre driven). Even though the 
value of your car is reduced as soon as you drive it off the lot, your 
standby charge stays the same. The car’s depreciating value is 
ignored in calculating the standby charge.
 
You can reduce the standby charge if you drive at least 50 percent 
for employment use and your personal kilometres driven are less 
than 20,004 in a year. If you’re employed principally in selling or 
leasing automobiles, you’re entitled to a lower operating benefit 
and standby charge.
 
✓ Club dues: If your employer is willing to pay for your dues to 
a recreational, sporting, or dining club, ensure you can show 
the membership is primarily to your employer’s advantage 
(think networking and sales prospecting!). When this is the 
case, the benefit is not taxable to you.
 
✓ Employee profit-sharing plans: Your employer should 
provide you with form T4PS, “Statement of Employee Profit-
Sharing Plan Allocations and Payments,” which details the 
amounts to include in your income. Amounts received by 
the plan from your employer and income earned in the plan 
during the year are included. However, a distribution actually 
made by the plan to you will generally be tax free because 
you’ve already paid tax on the amount received.
 
✓ Employment-related insurance payments you receive: 
Payments made to you for loss of income because of disability 
or sickness or accident or from an income maintenance plan 
are taxable if your employer paid your premiums.

87
 #20: Don’t Be Surprised by Other Taxable Benefits
 
Make sure your plan at work is set up so that you pay the premi-
ums. That way any disability payments will be tax free if you ever 
have to collect.
 
✓ Forgiveness of employee debt: Do you have a nice employer 
who has lent you money? Do you have an even nicer employer 
who forgave some or all of this debt? In this case, your debt 
may be gone but the value of the forgiven amount is taxable. 
(Refer to Tip #18 for more about employee loans.)
 
✓ Group term life insurance premiums: These premiums, paid 
by your employer, are considered to be a taxable benefit 
received by you.
 
✓ Reimbursements and awards: Such items received because 
of your employment — for example, paid holidays or incen-
tive awards from employer-related contests — are taxable to 
you.
 
✓ Rent-free or low-rent housing: If your employer provides 
you with rent-free or low-rent accommodations, the differ-
ence between the actual market value of that housing and 
the amount you’re required to pay will be included in your 
employment income. An exception occurs when your duties 
are performed at a remote location or special work site. See 
Tip #21 for further details.
 
✓ Spouse’s travelling expenses: If your spouse joins you on a 
business trip, you’ll probably have a taxable benefit equal to 
your spouse’s travelling expenses paid for by your employer, 
unless your spouse was primarily engaged in business activi-
ties on behalf of your employer.
 
No harm exists in extending your business trip to include a per-
sonal vacation. Because the initial trip was for business purposes, 
the costs paid by your employer will be tax-free benefits. Of 
course, this is provided you pick up all the additional costs for 
your extended trip (other than the trip home).
 
✓ Surface transit passes provided to family members of tran-
sit employees: Effective for 2010, the non-taxation of free or 
discounted surface transit passes applies only for passes pro-
vided to the transit employee and for the exclusive use of the 
employee (so, passes that can be used by family members will 
now be a taxable benefit).

88
#21
Negotiate Non-Taxable 
Benefits
N
on-taxable benefits are benefits from your employer you can 
enjoy tax free. Keep them in mind when you’re negotiat-
ing your way into a new job or simply at your next compensation 
review — you can load up on these perks with abandon, because 
they have no negative effect on your tax situation.
Big Wins
The following are some of the more common non-taxable benefits 
that may translate into major tax relief for you: 
 
✓ Computer and Internet services: The CRA says that the provi-
sion of home computers and Internet services to an employee 
where the primary use is for work or for the employee to 
become more computer literate is not a taxable benefit. The 
CRA suggests the employee pay a nominal fee for personal use.
 
✓ Death benefits: If you pass away and your employer pays a 
death benefit to your family, they receive the first $10,000 of 
that benefit tax free. 
 
✓ Education costs: When your employer picks up the tab for 
education, you won’t have to pay additional taxes for taking 
a course provided you’re benefiting your employer. If the 
course is of personal interest, it would result in a taxable 
benefit because it has nothing to do with your work. So, if 
your employer kindly agrees to pay for your Bee Keeping for 
Beginners course, just be prepared for the taxable benefit.
 
✓ Food and lodging: Food and lodging are not taxable benefits 
if you were required to work at a temporary site for more than 
36 hours consecutively. To qualify, the temporary site must 
be in a remote place or be farther away than a reasonable 
daily commute from your residence, and you must keep your 
usual residence.

89
 #21: Negotiate Non-Taxable Benefits
 
✓ Moving costs: When your employer pays for or reimburses 
you for moving costs where the move is for employment, no 
taxable benefit exists.
 
Ensure you negotiate this tax-free benefit when considering a new 
job where a move is necessary.
 
If your employer compensates you for the diminished value or loss 
on the sale of your home due to relocation, you’re considered to 
have received a taxable benefit. However, the taxable amount is 
only half of the amount reimbursed over $15,000. Better than noth-
ing, we say!
 
✓ Parking space: The fair market value of an employer-provided 
parking space, minus any amount you pay for the spot, must 
usually be included in your income. If your employer provides 
a parking space to you and you use your vehicle regularly 
during business hours to carry out your employment duties, 
it’s not a taxable benefit. Of course, when the spot is in a loca-
tion where free parking is readily accessible, then there will 
be no taxable benefit.
 
✓ Personal counselling: Not many people know this, but your 
employer can pay for counselling related to your or a rela-
tive’s mental or physical health and you won’t have to report 
a taxable benefit. The counselling may be related to tobacco, 
drug, or alcohol abuse; stress management; job placement; 
or retirement. Be sure to negotiate these payments with your 
employer if you find yourself or someone related to you in 
need of these services.
 
✓ Scholarship: If your employer has a scholarship plan to 
assist children of employees, the scholarship money can be 
received tax free by the child.
 
✓ Transportation to the job: Some employers provide their 
employees with transportation to and from work, for security 
or some other reason (think private limo with a driver, not 
city bus with an employer-provided bus pass). Whatever the 
reason, there will be no inclusion for the value of the benefit 
in the employee’s income. Sit back and enjoy the ride without 
worrying about any tax hit.
Smaller Victories
The benefits we cover in this section may be slightly less impact-
ful than some of those we discuss in the previous section over the 
long term, but they can translate into significant savings. After all, 
Rome wasn’t built in a day. Try to negotiate for the following from 
your employer:

Part II: Tips for Employees and Business Owners  
90
 
✓ Contributions to private health services plans
 
✓ Contributions to pension plans
 
✓ Contributions to a deferred profit sharing plan (DPSP)
 
✓ Merchandise discounts, if extended to all employees
 
✓ The cost of uniforms, and the cleaning of them
 
✓ In-house recreational and fitness facilities
 
✓ In-house daycare services (but not daycare provided by a 
third party and paid for by your employer)
 
✓ Supplemental unemployment benefit plan premiums
Subsidized meals
The CRA has relaxed the rules for overtime meals to reflect sea-
sonal overtime and general market conditions. Employees now 
have to work only an additional 2 hours daily for a meal reimburse-
ment or allowance of up to $17 to be tax-free.
Travel and meals within 
a municipality or 
metropolitan area 
The CRA has announced it will accept that travel allowances 
(including meals) paid for travel within the employer’s munici-
pality or metropolitan area can be excluded from income if the 
allowance is paid primarily for the benefit of the employer. As long 
as you can demonstrate that the amount you received benefited 
your employer more than you it’s a green light to exclude these 
amounts from income.
Loyalty programs
CRA used to take the position that a taxable benefit existed where 
employees incurred business expenses (using personal credit 
cards) that were later reimbursed by their employers and accrued 
reward points on these expenses that were used for personal pur-
poses. This is obviously beneficial to an employee, but there was 
no way an employer could possibly track and report a benefit.
The CRA admitted this and made it clear there generally shouldn’t 
be a benefit. Bring on the Air Miles!

91
 #21: Negotiate Non-Taxable Benefits
Gifts and awards from your employer
You can receive two non-cash gifts per year, and if the combined cost 
to your employer is $500 or less the entire amount is non-taxable. 
But watch out: If the total amount of the gifts you receive cost your 
employer more than $500, the entire amount becomes taxable — not 
just the portion above $500. The CRA provides for a second $500 
exemption where a long-term service award is provided.
 
Gifts that have been personalized with your name or corporate 
logo will have a reduced market value. When the award is a plaque, 
trophy, or other memento for which no market exists, there likely 
will be no taxable benefit.
 
A prize recognized by the public for certain achievements or ser-
vices can be non-taxable!
For 2010 and subsequent years the CRA revised and simplified 
its policy such that the $500 exemptions can now be used as a 
deduction when calculating taxable benefits. For gifts and general 
rewards, there will be no limit to the number of gifts/awards that 
can be given during the year. 
 
Cash and near-cash awards (think gift cards) are still excluded 
from this policy, as are those of you who own your business and 
are also employees of it. (We know, we know — life’s not fair!)

92
#22
Deduct Employment 
Expenses
You may be one of many employees who are required to fund 
the costs of carrying out your employment duties. These 
costs can vary from taking prospective customers out to lunch to 
using your own car for sales calls to perhaps using space in your 
home or apartment for work purposes. If your employer doesn’t 
directly reimburse you for these costs (usually via an expense 
report), one of two things likely happens:
 
✓ Your employer pays you an allowance to cover your 
expenses, but the allowance is included in your T4 employ-
ment income. In other words, you pay tax on the allowance.
 
✓ Your employer does not pay you an allowance. You’re simply 
required to pay your own expenses.
If you fall into one of these categories, you should be able to claim 
a deduction for at least some, if not all, of the expenses you incur 
to do your job.
 
When you don’t fall into one of these categories, try not to be 
overly jealous of those who do. Though it’s nice to be able to 
deduct employment expenses, limits apply on what you can claim, 
and it’s better when your employer simply reimburses the costs. 
The reimbursement is not a taxable benefit to you. With a reim-
bursement, you’re not out any money; your employer returns to 
you every dollar you spend in doing your job. In deducting employ-
ment expenses, the best you can do is receive about a 46-cent 
refund for every dollar deducted — and this assumes you’re in the 
top tax bracket.
Figuring Out Who Can Deduct
To deduct the expenses you incur to carry out your employment 
duties, the following must apply to you:

93
 #22: Deduct Employment Expenses
 
✓ You must be required to pay expenses to earn your employ-
ment income (in the CRA’s words, you must be required to 
incur the expenses under the terms of your employment con-
tract, whether or not you have a written contract).
 
✓ Your employer must provide you with a form detailing 
the expenses you’re required to incur. The form is T2200, 
“Declarations of Conditions of Employment.” It’s completed 
and signed by your employer — not you.
Comparing Commissioned 
Salespeople and Regular 
Employees
CRA’s rules governing what commission salespeople can deduct 
are somewhat more generous than the rules for salaried employ-
ees (see Table 2-1 for details). In addition to being allowed to 
deduct specific expenses, salespeople can deduct any reasonable 
expense incurred to earn income (such as commissions) that is 
based on the amount of sales they generate.
To be able to deduct expenses as a salesperson, you must pass the 
following tests:
 
✓ You must be required to pay your own expenses by virtue of 
your contract of employment;
 
✓ You must ordinarily be required to carry on the duties of your 
employment away from your employer’s business location 
(e.g., at customer locations);
 
✓ Your remuneration must be wholly or partly based on com-
missions or other amounts, such as bonuses, which are cal-
culated by reference to the volume of sales made or contracts 
negotiated; and
 
✓ You must not be in receipt of a tax-free travel allowance for 
your expenses.
If you’re deducting expenses as a commission salesperson, you 
have a few things to remember. First, you can deduct expenses 
only to the extent of your commission income. If your expenses 
exceed this income, you cannot deduct the excess amount. And 
the excess can’t be transferred to another year to deduct against 
income earned then. Second, you can always deduct certain 

Part II: Tips for Employees and Business Owners  
94
expenses as a regular employee against your salary. You need to 
use the rules that allow you to deduct certain expenses as a com-
mission salesperson only if you couldn’t otherwise deduct them as 
a regular employee.
 
Always consider the rules for regular employees and then use the 
rules for commission salespeople only when expense deduction 
is higher, to reduce the likelihood that your expenses will exceed 
your commission income.
Table 2-2 compares the expenses that can be deducted by an 
employee earning a salary and those that can be deducted by an 
employee being paid on a commission basis.

Notes
1. An alternative filing opportunity is to claim the accounting fee as a carrying charge 
on schedule 4. Refer to Tip #42, which deals with the deduction available for carrying 
charges and interest expenses.
2. Only 50 percent of entertainment, food, and beverage expenses can be deducted. 
This restriction also applies to gift certificates for these items.
3. Food, beverage, and lodging are deductible only if your employer requires you to be 
away from the municipality or metropolitan area where your employer is located for at 
least 12 hours.
4. You can deduct travel expenses if you were normally required to work away from 
your employer’s business or in different places, and you did not receive a non-taxable 
allowance to cover travelling expenses.
5. The CRA’s position is that parking costs at your employer’s office are not deductible 
because they’re considered a personal expense. However, if you need to go to the 
office before or after seeing a customer, or to work at a different location, we would 
argue that the parking in these circumstances should be deductible.
6. Supplies must be used directly in your work and for nothing else. The CRA takes the 
position that these supplies include “pens, pencils, paper clips, stationery, stamps, 
street maps, and directories.” They do not include items such as briefcases or calcula-
tors. Tools are not deductible unless you’re a tradesperson. (We discuss tools later in 
this tip.)
7. Restricted to work-related cost of calls and airtime.
8. The CRA’s guide Employment Expenses now specifically states that Internet charges 
are not deductible by an employee. However, it remains silent on Internet charges for 
a commissioned employee. We expect that they would be deductible, to be consistent 
with the treatment of cell phone charges and leasing costs. 
9. Annual licence fees are deductible if needed to carry out work (for example, real 
estate and insurance licences).
10. Your employer must specifically indicate on form T2200 that you’re required to incur 
these costs.

Consider an example that illustrates some of the points in Table 2-2.
Charlie took an industrial sales job with Pinegrove Products Inc. of 
Oakville, Ontario, on February 1, 2009. His conditions of employ-
ment were that he was to be paid on a commission basis and that 
he was required to do the following:
 
✓ Pay for his own office supplies (paper, toner, postage, and 
so on)
 
✓ Pay the salary of his part-time assistant, Buffy
 
✓ Provide a home office for himself and Buffy (Charlie was 
not provided with a workspace at Pinegrove.)
 
✓ Provide his own car because the job involved significant 
travel in southern Ontario
During 2009, Charlie made commissions of $90,000. He paid 5 
percent GST on his expenses when applicable. (All his expenses 
were incurred in Ontario, so he did not pay any HST in 2009.) In 
this example, assuming Charlie spent $5,300 on office supplies 
and $4,000 for Buffy’s salary, he’d be entitled to a full deduction of 
$9,300 against his commission income.
The distinction that Charlie is being paid on a commission basis is 
an important one. The expenses that may be deducted by commis-
sion employee versus a regular employee are different.
The benefit of leasing tools and 
computer equipment
Consider renting or leasing tools and computer equipment from a third party. 
Generally no deduction can be claimed by employees for capital assets, but the 
cost of renting or leasing these assets can be deducted. You could also consider 
having a family member such as your spouse purchase the assets and rent them to 
you. You would then be entitled to a deduction against your employment income. 
Your spouse would report the rental payments received from you as income but 
would be entitled to deduct capital cost allowance (CCA) on the assets, interest 
expense, and other related costs against the income.
We recommend you get professional help before implementing this strategy to 
make sure it makes financial sense for you and that you do not run afoul of the 
tax man.

 #22: Deduct Employment Expenses
Let the CRA’s Forms Help You
The CRA publishes form T777, “Statement of Employment 
Expenses,” to assist you in gathering and summarizing your 
employment expenses. This is the form used by the majority of 
employees.
A second employee expense form, TL2, “Claim for Meals and 
Lodging Expenses,” is used by employees involved in air, rail, 
bus, and trucking industries. Another form that can come into 
play is form GST 370, “Employee and Partner GST/HST Rebate 
Application.” Most employees like this form because it works only 
one way: It assists you in calculating the amount of GST/HST you 
can recover from the government!
 
The employment expenses you deduct are to include the GST, HST, 
and provincial and territorial sales taxes you paid. Do not separate 
the GST/HST or provincial/territorial sales taxes from the non-tax 
portion of your expenses. If you lived in Alberta (no provincial 
sales tax) and purchased $100 of deductible supplies to do your 
job, you would actually pay $105 when the GST is added. It’s the 
$105 that is included in your employment expenses on the T777.
 
If you’re eligible to claim a deduction for employment expenses, 
recordkeeping is vital for a number of reasons. One, you don’t 
want to miss out on claiming a legitimate expense. If you do, you 
overstate your tax liability! Two, the CRA can request employees 
to provide support for the expenses claimed on their tax return. 
The CRA is usually happy to accept the deduction for employment 
expenses, provided the support (receipts, invoices, ticket stubs, 
kilometre log, and so on) is organized and available for inspection 
should it be requested. Third, you simplify your tax return prepa-
ration. Don’t even think of bringing a shopping bag (or the infa-
mous shoebox) full of receipts and stuff to an accountant in late 
April and expect to be pleasantly welcomed!
Deals on Wheels — Claiming 
Your Automobile Expenses
If you pay your own automobile expenses and are required to use 
your car to carry out your employment duties, you can deduct a 
portion of your costs in completing your income tax return. As 
noted above, your employer would indicate on form T2200 that 
you need to supply your own car and incur expenses to keep it on 
the road. Here are some types of automobile expenses that can be 
deducted:

Part II: Tips for Employees and Business Owners  
98
 
✓ Capital cost allowance (CCA or tax depreciation)
 
✓ Fuel
 
✓ Insurance
 
✓ Interest incurred on a loan to purchase a car
 
✓ Leasing costs
 
✓ Licence and registration fees
 
✓ Repairs and maintenance
 
It’s only the “employment use” portion of automobile expenses 
that is included in your deductible employment expenses. The CRA 
states that driving only to and from work is personal use — not 
employment use. However, if you need to go out in your car in the 
middle of the day (say, to see a potential customer), or perhaps 
on your way to or from work, the whole trip can be considered 
employment use.
Recall our friend Charlie, who started working at Pinegrove on 
February 1, 2009 and was required to provide his own car. Charlie 
used his Honda Civic, which he had leased a few years back. His 
lease costs for the period were $3,300 ($300 per month for 11 
months). From February to December 2009, Charlie drove the Civic 
a total of 20,000 kilometres — 15,000 were work related.
Charlie, being ever fearful of a CRA query, kept a log in his glove 
compartment that detailed his work trips and kilometres driven. 
He updated the log daily. Based on the kilometres, it’s clear that 
Charlie used his car 75 percent of the time for work and 25 percent 
for personal use. Charlie can deduct 75 percent of his automobile 
expenses in calculating his deductible employment expenses.
Let’s calculate Charlie’s automobile expenses:

 #22: Deduct Employment Expenses
 
Do you really need to keep a log of your kilometres driven for 
employment use? Yes, kind of. If the CRA asks you to support your 
automobile expenses, it will want to see your log of kilometres. So 
get in the habit of keeping the log in the car. Every time you get in 
the car, make an entry of where you’re going, and later where you 
have been and the kilometres travelled.
Starting in 2009 you have to keep this log only for a time that is 
considered representative of your normal auto use. We recom-
mend you do this — you’ll thank us if the CRA comes knocking!
Capital cost allowance (CCA) 
when an automobile is owned 
rather than leased
Because your car is expected to last more than a year, its cost 
cannot be completely deducted in computing your employment 
expenses. However, a percentage of the car’s capital cost allow-
ance (CCA for short) can. CCA is the tax term for depreciation (see 
Tip #32). The first step in determining the amount of CCA you can 
deduct is to decide whether your automobile is “class 10” or “class 
10.1” for CCA purposes. Both CCA classes 10 and 10.1 calculate 
the maximum CCA that can be claimed, at a rate of 30 percent cal-
culated on the declining-balance method of depreciation, which 
involves applying the depreciation rate against the non-depreci-
ated balance. Instead of spreading the cost of the asset evenly over 
its life, this system expenses the asset at a constant rate, which 
results in declining depreciation charges each successive period.
Note: Use class 10.1 if your car cost $30,000 or more (before PST 
and GST or HST) and class 10 if it cost less than $30,000.
In the year you purchase an automobile, the “half-year” rule 
applies — meaning you can take only 50 percent of the CCA you 
would otherwise be entitled to. This results in a CCA calculation 
at 15 percent (30 percent × 1⁄2 = 15 percent). The determination 
of whether your car is considered a “class 10” or a “class 10.1” 
automobile is important, as the CCA on class 10.1 automobiles is 
restricted to a maximum amount. We discuss the restrictions on 
CCA and other automobile expenses shortly.
Assume that rather than leasing his Honda Civic, Charlie pur-
chased the Civic in 2009 for $23,000, taxes included. (By the way, 
this car qualifies as class 10 — therefore, no restrictions apply in 
calculating CCA.) Let’s take a look at how Charlie would calculate 
CCA for 2009 and 2010.

Part II: Tips for Employees and Business Owners  
100
Before calculating CCA, Charlie would calculate his employee 
expense deduction for the operating expenses of his car in the 
same way as above. He would add up the amounts he spent for 
fuel, repairs, licensing, insurance, and so on. (Of course there 
would be no leasing costs, as we are assuming here that he owns 
the car!) He would then multiply the total amount of expenses by 
the employment-use portion. In our preceding example, 75 percent 
was used for the 2009 year; we’ll assume the appropriate employ-
ment usage figure is also 75 percent for 2010.
Table 2-3 summarizes how Charlie would calculate CCA for 2009 
and 2010.
Table 2-3

$19,550
CCA at 30 percent2
($5,865)
UCC at December 31, 2010
$13,685
1. This part of the calculation results in only half of the capital cost of the acquisitions 
in 2009 being depreciated. While the CCA rate is 30 percent, the subtracted amount 
results in the CCA being only 15 percent — half of 30 percent. This calculation is 
referred to as the “half-year” rule.
2. Remember that Charlie used his car only 75 percent of the time to carry out his 
employment duties. Therefore, his tax deduction is 75 percent of the CCA calculated. In 
2009 — $3,450 × 75% = $2,587.50. In 2010 — $5,965 × 75% = $4,398.75.

101
 #22: Deduct Employment Expenses
 
Claiming CCA, whether for an automobile or any asset on which 
CCA can be claimed, is optional. A taxpayer (whether employed or 
self-employed, or perhaps a corporation) may decide to claim less 
than the maximum CCA, or no CCA at all! Although at first it may 
seem odd that a taxpayer would not take maximum advantage of a 
tax deduction available, some logical reasons for this do exist. For 
example, perhaps the taxpayer will be in a higher tax bracket next 
year. This will result in a greater tax reduction than if the CCA is 
taken this year.
Restrictions on certain 
automobile expenses
If you’re entitled to deduct a portion of your automobile as 
employment expenses, you deduct only the “business use” portion 
of the expenses you actually paid. This is true for most of your 
expenses. The amount you pay is the starting point in determining 
what you can deduct. Three exceptions apply:
 
✓ Automobile leasing costs (see Table 2-4)
 
✓ Interest on car loans (see Table 2-4)
 
✓ Capital cost on which CCA will begin to be calculated (see 
Table 2-5)
Table 2-4

and Interest Costs

1. The government reviews these limits annually and announces any changes prior to 
the end of the year so that taxpayers are aware of the rules in advance of the year in 
which they apply. The rates are set by the Department of Finance Canada and released 
by press release.
2. All limits are before sales tax. The limits are actually slightly higher when provincial 
and territorial retail sales tax and GST/HST are added.

The above limits are before provincial/territorial retail sales tax 
and GST/HST. If you purchased a car in Ontario, for example, you 
would pay an 8 percent Ontario sales tax and the 5 percent GST — 
a total of 13 percent. The deemed maximum capital cost for claim-
ing CCA on your car purchase in 2009 would be $33,900 ($30,000 × 
113 percent = $33,900).
When these exceptions apply, you’ll find that the amounts you use 
to begin calculating your deductible automobile expenses are less 
than you actually paid. And remember, these maximums apply 
before you prorate your automobile expenses between employ-
ment use and business use.
Let’s look at Finlay’s situation. Finlay is a salesman. On January 1, 
2009, he leased a Mercedes. His monthly lease cost is $850 (includ-
ing taxes). Finlay uses his car 60 percent for work. He expects 
that his monthly effective tax deduction will be $510 ($850 × 60 
percent), or $6,120 per year. He’s not worried about the lease cost 
restriction because he understands the maximum cost for leases 
commenced in 2009 is $800 (see Table 2-4). Finlay is wrong! The 
effective tax deduction he will have is the $800 per month maxi-
mum multiplied by his 60 percent employment use, which results 
in a tax deduction equal to $480 per month, or $5,760 for all of 2009.
Home Is Where the Office Is — 
Claiming Home Office Expenses
If your employer requires you to provide space in your home or 
apartment to carry out your employment duties, your employer 
must indicate this on form T2200 and provide it to you. If you do 
maintain a home office, you can deduct a portion of the expenses 
related to maintaining the workspace. This includes a portion of 
the expenses that you incur anyway, such as monthly utilities and 
rent.

103
 #22: Deduct Employment Expenses
For the costs to be deductible, you must ensure your workspace 
meets one of two tests — you don’t have to meet both! Under 
the first test, the workspace must be the primary place where 
your employment duties are carried out. A sales representative 
employed by a company may work from home and rarely “go to 
the office.” A part-time night school teacher may not have an office 
at a school and must plan lessons and mark exams at home.
Under the second test, your workspace must be used exclusively 
to carry out your employment duties and you must use the space 
on a “regular and continuous” basis for meeting customers or cli-
ents or others associated with carrying out your duties. Infrequent 
meetings or frequent meetings at irregular intervals won’t cut it.
Deductible home office expenses
As Table 2-5 details, an employee paid on a commission basis is 
able to deduct more home office expenses than an employee paid 
by salary.

Telephone expenses are not mentioned here. Though you may 
think of these as a home office expense, they can be deducted as 
“supplies” in completing form T777. The CRA’s position is that 
long-distance charges for calls made to carry out your employment 
duties can be deducted, but that the monthly charges for your resi-
dential phone line cannot — not even a portion of them. However, 
if you have a separate phone line for your employment, the full 
costs associated with this phone can be deducted.

Part II: Tips for Employees and Business Owners  
104
Deductions for Special 
Employment Situations
Many of us have truly unique employment circumstances, and some 
of them call for uncommon expenses. Happily, the CRA recognizes 
this, and allows for a wide range of deductions. Here’s a look at 
some of the occupations that have deductions of their own — be 
sure to claim everything that fits:
 
✓ Artists: If you’re an employed artist, you’ll enjoy some deduc-
tions in addition to the “regular” employee expenses. The CRA 
considers you an artist if you do any of the following:
 
• Create (but don’t reproduce) paintings, prints, etchings, 
drawings, sculptures, or similar works of art
 
• Compose dramatic, musical, or literary works
 
• Perform dramatic or musical work, as an actor, singer, 
or musician
 
• Belong to a professional artists’ association that is certi-
fied by the Minister of Canadian Heritage
 
 An artist who earns income from any of the above activities 
may deduct related expenses incurred to earn this income. 
Again, these “related” expenses are in addition to the regular 
employment expenses deductible by all types of employees 
who are required to incur these expenses as part of their job.
 
✓ Mechanics’ apprentices: A mechanic’s apprentice can deduct 
a portion of the cost of tools acquired in a year on his or her 
personal tax return. Those of you with a “vehicle mechanic in 
training” in the family will know what a significant investment 
these tools are in relation to income.
 
 Unfortunately, a deduction for the full cost of the tools is not 
allowed. The allowable deduction amount is the total cost 
of new tools acquired in a taxation year, less the greater of 
$1,000 or 5 percent of the individual’s apprenticeship income 
for the year.
 
 Any part of the eligible deduction that is not taken in the year 
in which the tools are purchased can be carried forward and 
deducted in subsequent taxation years. You can also claim a 
GST/HST tax credit for the sales taxes paid on the deductible 
portion of the tools.
  
✓ Musicians: In addition to the costs noted above for employ-
ees, if you’re a musician you may be entitled to deduct capital 
cost allowance on your instrument (class 8 — 20 percent 

105
 #22: Deduct Employment Expenses
declining basis), as well as any amounts paid for the mainte-
nance, rental, and insurance of the instrument. To claim these 
amounts, you must be required, as a term of your employ-
ment, to provide your own musical instrument.
 
✓ Tradespeople: Tradespersons who acquire eligible tools for 
employment can deduct the cost exceeding $1,000 each year 
up to a maximum of $500 per year.
 
✓ Transport employees: If you’re employed in the transport 
industry (air, rail, and bus travel, and trucking), you and your 
employer are required to complete form TL2, “Claim for Meals 
and Lodging Expenses.” The total of the amount deductible is 
to be included on line 229 of your tax return. Like non–trans-
port industry employees, you may be eligible for a GST/HST 
rebate.

106
#23
Get Your GST Rebate
T
he Goods and Services Tax (GST) and Harmonized Sales Tax 
(HST) are consumer taxes. This means that when you incur GST 
or HST in carrying out your employment duties, you’re really incur-
ring it on behalf of your employer’s business — not as a consumer. 
Therefore, the GST or HST should be refunded or rebated to you 
because it was not incurred for a consumer purchase. In this tip, we 
outline when you’re eligible to claim a GST/HST rebate, what pur-
chases are eligible for the rebate, and how to get your money back.
 
No rebate applies for provincial and territorial sales taxes. They 
simply remain part of the costs you incurred in carrying out your 
employment responsibilities.
Assessing Your Eligibility 
for the GST/HST Rebate
If you have to pay your own expenses to carry out your employ-
ment duties, you’re probably able to claim a rebate for the GST 
and HST included in your expenses.
You’re not eligible to claim the GST/HST if either of the following 
applies to your situation:
 
✓ Your employer is not a GST/HST registrant
 
✓ Your employer carries on a GST/HST–exempt activity, which 
includes one of the following:
 
• Health care (for example, a medical or dental practice)
 
• Financial services (for example, banking, insurance, and 
investing)
Determining Which Expenses 
Qualify for the GST/HST Rebate
You can claim the GST/HST rebate on any expenses you paid GST/
HST on and deducted on form T777, plus the GST/HST component 

107
 #23: Get Your GST Rebate
of the union or professional dues deducted on line 212 of your tax 
return.
Naturally, you can’t claim GST/HST on purchases that didn’t 
attract the tax, such as the following:
 
✓ Goods or services that are GST exempt, such as some mem-
bership fees and dues, insurance, licences, and salaries to 
assistants.
 
✓ Employment expenses where no GST/HST was paid because 
the vendor of the goods or provider of the services was not 
registered for GST and, therefore, did not charge GST.
Additionally, you can’t claim the rebate on the personal-use por-
tion of your automobile and home office expenses. Remember, the 
rebate is for business expenses, not consumer purchases.
Calculating and Claiming 
Your GST/HST Rebate
In order to claim your GST/HST rebate you need to tally up your 
employment expenses you’ve deducted in the year, subtract the 
non-eligible ones (which we discussed in Tip #22) and then back 
out the GST to figure out what your rebate should be. 
Now you say, “HOLD IT!” You’ve just realized that you receive two 
benefits doing the calculation this way:
 
✓ You got a tax saving from being able to deduct the GST com-
ponent of your employment expenses.
 
✓ You received back the GST you paid.
Isn’t this double dipping on a tax/GST break?!
Congratulations on being so observant. You will indeed have 
received a double benefit. In fact, the government purposely 
designed the system this way! (Who else could?) However, when 
you prepare your tax return for next year, the double benefit will 
be taken away. The GST/HST rebate you recieve will be included 
on line 104 of your tax return and will be fully subject to tax. So, in 
one year you have the benefit of deducting the GST/HST portion of 
your employment expenses. After two years, the only double dip-
ping you will do is at Dairy Queen.
The rebate you’re entitled to is calculated on form GST 370, 
“Employee and Partner GST/HST Rebate Application.”

Give Yourself Credit: More 
Tips for Employees
E
mployees are very limited in the expenses they can deduct 
when calculating the tax they owe to the CRA — therefore, 
much to the chagrin of many Canadians, employment income is 
where we pay the bulk of our taxes. But don’t despair. In this tip 
we provide a few more strategies to help you keep your taxes to a 
minimum. 
Get a Refund When You Overpay 
CPP Premiums
As you may know, your employer has to take CPP premiums off 
your pay. However, it’s possible that you paid too much! This most 
commonly happens when you held more than one job during the 
year — because each employer is obligated to withhold CPP with-
out regard to your other employers, you may have maxed out your 
annual payments. See the CRA Web site (www.cra-arc.gc.ca/
tx/bsnss/tpcs/pyrll/clcltng/cpp-rpc/cnt-chrt-pf-
eng.html) for the current year’s maximum contribution.
If you were not a resident of Quebec and you contributed more 
than you were required to, enter the difference on line 448 of your 
tax return. The CRA will refund the excess contributions to you, or 
will apply them to reduce your balance owing. If you were a resi-
dent of Quebec, this line does not apply to you; claim the excess 
amount on your Quebec provincial tax return.
 
Don’t worry if you don’t realize you made a CPP overpayment. The 
CRA will catch it when assessing your return.
Get a Refund When You 
Overpay EI Premiums
As with the CPP overpayment, you may have had too much EI 
deducted from your pay in the year. If you contributed more than 

109
 #24: Give Yourself Credit: More Tips for Employees
you had to, enter the difference on line 450. The CRA will refund 
the excess amount to you or use it to reduce your balance owing. 
See the CRA Web site (www.cra-arc.gc.ca/tx/bsnss/tpcs/
pyrll/clcltng/ei/hstrc-eng.html#chart) for the current 
year’s maximum contribution.
 
If you repaid some of the EI benefits you received, don’t claim the 
repayment on this line. If the repayment was in connection with EI 
received in 2008 or later years, you need to include the amount on 
line 235.
 
Again, if you fail to calculate that you have overpaid EI premiums, 
the CRA will catch it on assessing your return.
Claim the Canada Employment 
Tax Credit
This credit is designed to help offset some of the work-related 
expenses incurred by employees. For 2009, the credit amount is 
calculated as the lesser of $1,044 and the individual’s employment 
income for the year.
 
You don’t have to actually incur expenses in order to claim this 
credit. And no receipts are required. This is a gimme, so be sure to 
claim it — and save $157 in federal tax ($1,044 × 15 percent)!
Deduct Your Union or 
Professional Dues
Because you’re taxed on pretty much all your income, it’s logical 
that costs incurred to earn the income are deductible. It is logi-
cal — but no one ever said the Income Tax Act was logical. One of 
the deductions permitted is the cost of belonging to a union or to 
a professional body, or the cost of carrying professional or mal-
practice insurance. Union dues paid are noted in box 44 of your 
T4. Fees paid to professional organizations are usually receipted. If 
your employer pays the fees for your professional memberships or 
insurance, the employer gets the tax deduction — you don’t, even 
if the receipt is in your name.
 
If you paid GST or HST on your union or professional dues, you 
may be able to have the GST refunded to you. See Tip #23 for the 
details on making the claim.

Get Credit for Your Commuting 
Costs — Public Transit Expenses
If you use public transportation, you may be able to offset the cost 
of your transit pass with this non-refundable credit. The federal tax 
credit, or federal tax savings, is the eligible amount you spent mul-
tiplied by 15 percent.
The credit applies when you
 
✓ Purchase public transit passes with a duration of a month or 
longer
 
✓ Purchase four consecutive weekly passes and each pass enti-
tles you to unlimited use for at least five days each week.
 
✓ Purchase via electronic payment cards if you use the card for 
at least 32 one-way trips during an interrupted period of no 
more than 31 days.
Public transit includes transit by local bus, streetcar, subway, 
commuter train, commuter bus, and local ferry. The credit can be 
claimed by you or your spouse for eligible transit costs incurred 
by you, your spouse, or dependent children under the age of 19.
 
If this credit applies to you, be sure to keep your receipts and 
passes in case the CRA asks for proof — we know from experience 
they like to review the support for this credit.

Plan for a Loss of Employment

with the following tax strategies could be invaluable.

If you lose your job, any legal fees you pay to collect a severance 
or retirement allowance or a pension benefit are tax deductible on 
line 232 of your return. You can claim fees only up to the amount of 
the payment received in the year — minus any amount transferred 
to your RRSP. If you cannot claim all your legal fees in the year 
paid, they may be able to be claimed over the next seven years.
 
Ensure your lawyer details the bill such that fees for tax-deductible 
services are highlighted!
Roll Over Your Pension
The funds in your Registered Pension Plan (See Tip #17 for more 
details on pensions) are locked in so they will be there to provide 
you with an income on retirement. If you leave your employer you 
can’t simply receive a cheque for the value of your pension sav-
ings. You will need to choose one of the following three options:
 
✓ Roll your existing pension into your new employer’s pension.
 
✓ Leave it where it is and take your pension from that company 
when you retire.
 
✓ Transfer your money into a locked in retirement account 
(LIRA).
We recommend you consult with a qualified and experienced finan-
cial professional to help you decide which of these options is for 
you. Your future financial security could depend on you making a 
good decision.

Shelter Your Retiring Allowance
Don’t be confused by the term retiring allowance — it doesn’t 
apply only to payments you receive when you retire. In fact, it also 
includes what people normally refer to as “severance” or “termina-
tion” pay, as well as to a court award or settlement for wrongful 
dismissal.
Portion of retiring allowance 
eligible for RRSPs
Retiring allowances are taxable. However, when you leave your 
employer and receive a retiring allowance, you might be able to 
pay a portion of your payment into your RRSP. This portion is 
called your “eligible” retiring allowance. If you choose to do this, 
you include the full amount of the allowance on line 130 of your tax 
return, but a deduction is given on line 208 for the amount paid to 
your RRSP. If those two amounts are the same, you will effectively 
receive the retiring allowance tax free — or at least tax-free (yes 
that’s right — we said tax-free) until the time you make withdraw-
als out of your RRSP. 
 
Not all retiring allowances are eligible for transfer into your RRSP. 
In fact, the Income Tax Act sets limits on the amount of retiring 
allowance you can have paid into your RRSP. The limit is calcu-
lated as follows:
 
✓ $2,000 per year or part year of employment service prior to 
1996, plus
 
✓ $1,500 per year or part year of employment service prior to 
1989 in which you had no vested interest in any employer’s 
contributions to a registered pension plan or deferred profit-
sharing plan.
So, if you worked for an employer from, say, 1997 to 2009, any 
retiring allowance paid to you would not be eligible for the special 
transfer into your RRSP. Too bad!
Let’s suppose Alex left her employer in 2009 and received a $50,000 
termination payment. She had started working there in 1985 and 
joined the pension plan in 1987.
The amount she can have paid to her RRSP is calculated this way:

113
 #25: Plan for a Loss of Employment
$2,000 × 11 years (1985 to 1995)
$22,000
$1,500 × 2 years (1985 to 1987)
$3,000
Eligible portion of retiring allowance that can be paid to 
her RRSP
$25,000
 
The amount of a retiring allowance that can be paid to your RRSP 
and deducted on your personal tax return is over and above your 
regular RRSP contribution (or “deduction”) limit. You can still 
make your regular RRSP contribution in addition to this special 
contribution. It’s not critical that the retiring allowance be paid 
directly to your RRSP. However, you must contribute the funds to 
your RRSP within 60 days following the end of the year in which 
you receive the payment. For allowances received in 2009, this 
means the contribution must be made by March 1, 2010, or you 
lose your right to this special contribution.
The eligible portion of a retiring allowance can be rolled into an 
RRSP of which only you are the annuitant. It cannot go into a spou-
sal RRSP.
Ineligible portion of retiring 
allowance
Any allowance received in excess of the amount you can have 
paid to your RRSP under the rules outlined above is considered an 
ineligible retiring allowance. In other words, the ineligible retiring 
allowance is any portion paid to you that relates to your employ-
ment from 1997 on. This amount is reported in box 27 of your T4A, 
and must be reported on line 130 of your income tax return. The 
ineligible portion of a retiring allowance does not open up new 
RRSP room for you.
 
Here are a couple of tips that may help ease the tax burden on any 
ineligible portion of a retiring allowance:
 
✓ If you have regular unused RRSP contribution room, consider 
making an RRSP contribution with your ineligible retiring 
allowance. In fact, you can have your employer send the por-
tion that you are going to contribute directly to your RRSP 
and avoid any withholding tax. To do this you must show 
your employer that you have the RRSP contribution room 
available.
 
✓ Ask to receive the retiring allowance payment over a number 
of years. You don’t have to pay tax on a retiring allowance 
until it’s received, so this can help to defer tax to a year when 
you may be in a lower tax bracket.

Claim Your Moving Expenses
I
f you moved at least 40 kilometres to start a job (even just a 
summer job), to start a business, or for full-time post-secondary 
education, you may be eligible to deduct at least a portion of your 
moving expenses. In this tip, we spell out ways to determine just 
how much of your move is eligible, and how to deduct the cost of 
your move.
 
The eligible moving expenses may be deducted only from your 
employment or self-employment income earned at the new loca-
tion. If your current year’s eligible moving expenses exceeded your 
current year’s income at the new location, the excess can be car-
ried forward for deduction on the next year’s tax return.
Eligible Moving Expenses
Most moving expenses are eligible for a tax deduction. You must 
pay for the expenses by December 31 of the year you’re claiming 
them as deductions. Specifically, they are as follows:
 
✓ Travelling expenses, including automobile expenses for you 
and your family
 
✓ Meals and accommodations on the way to the new residence
 
✓ Costs of moving your stuff (moving van, storage, insurance, 
and so on)
 
✓ Costs for up to 15 days for you and your family for meals and 
temporary stay
 
✓ Costs of cancelling your lease on the old residence
 
✓ Costs of selling your old residence (advertising, legal fees,
real estate commission, and mortgage prepayment penalty
if applicable)
 
✓ Costs of maintaining your old residence when vacant (includ-
ing mortgage interest and property taxes) to a maximum of 
$5,000
 
✓ Legal fees and land transfer fees paid in acquiring the new 
residence, provided you sold the prior residence as a result of 
the move

115
 #26: Claim Your Moving Expenses
 
✓ Fees for utility disconnection and hook-ups
 
✓ Incidental costs related to the move (for example, costs of 
changing your address, and costs of acquiring new auto and 
driver’s licences)
With respect to automobile and meal costs incurred while moving, 
the CRA permits you to either claim the actual costs or use a 
flat rate. The CRA refers to the flat rate system as the “simplified 
method” — appropriately named, we say. Where you use the flat 
rate, you don’t need to retain receipts.
The flat rate for automobile travel varies by province or territory. 
If you don’t use the flat rate, you need to track all the costs of oper-
ating the car for a year (gas, maintenance, insurance, interest on 
car loans, depreciation, and so on). You then prorate the total of 
these costs by taking the number of kilometres driven for the move 
over the total number of kilometres driven for the complete year. 
(Ugh — that’s a lot of math.)
The flat rates for automobile and meal costs change every year 
and are posted on the CRA’s Web site at www.cra-arc.gc.ca/
travelcosts.
Employer-paid or -reimbursed 
Moving Expenses
You can deduct moving expenses only to the extent that the 
expenses were incurred by you. You cannot deduct expenses that 
were paid for by your employer, or that you incurred and were 
later reimbursed for by your employer. On the other hand, if your 
employer provided you with an allowance, this amount must be 
included in your income. Make sure you then claim any eligible 
moving expenses as a deduction.
 
When possible, always get your new employer to reimburse you 
for your moving expenses. This is advantageous for a number of 
reasons:
 
✓ You won’t be out any money. Even in the top tax bracket, a 
tax deduction is worth less than 50 cents on the dollar. This 
means that for each dollar you deduct, you save less than 50 
cents in tax. Isn’t it better to have your employer give you 
back the full dollar? (The employer can claim a deduction for 
amounts reimbursed to you.)

Part II: Tips for Employees and Business Owners  
116
 
✓ Some moving costs are not tax deductible. You definitely want 
to be reimbursed for these.
 
✓ You avoid the hassle of detailing all your moving expenses on 
your tax return, plus you are far less likely to have the CRA 
question your return.
 
✓ You do not need to wait for a tax refund to get your money 
back.
 
The CRA has stated that your employer can provide you with a 
non-accountable allowance of up to $650 as a reimbursement of 
moving expenses. The allowance will not be considered income 
provided you certify in writing that you incurred moving expenses 
of an amount at least equal to the allowance you received.
Claiming Moving Expenses 
on Your Tax Return
To claim moving expenses, complete form T1M, “Moving Expenses 
Deduction.” On this form you report where you moved from and 
to, why you moved, and the specific details and dollar amounts of 
your moving costs. 
Oddly, you’re not required to file either the T1M or any moving 
receipts with your tax return. However, you are required to 
keep these on hand in case of a CRA query. And trust us, queries 
happen.
Coming to or leaving Canada?
In most situations, moving expenses are not deductible if you’re moving to or from 
Canada. (In this situation, you definitely want to have your employer reimburse your 
moving expenses!) However, if you leave Canada to study full time, your moving 
expenses may be deductible if you have taxable income and you continue to be 
a Canadian resident for tax purposes. If you’re a full-time student and you came 
to Canada, you can deduct your moving expenses against your taxable income 
earned in Canada. (See Tip #51 for more details.)

Take Advantage of Special 
Employment Situations
C
anadians who are sent abroad by their employers for six 
months or longer and those who live in the northern regions 
get special treatment when it comes to tax time. In this tip, we look 
at the credits and deductions you may qualify for if you fall into 
one of those categories.
Over the Seas and Far Away: 
Claim the Overseas Employment 
Tax Credit
The overseas employment tax credit may be available to you if 
you’re a Canadian resident but worked abroad for six months or 
longer in connection with a resource, construction, installation, 
agricultural, or engineering project. Your employer must complete 
and sign form T626, “Overseas Employment Tax Credit.” If you 
qualify, you’ll find that some (and maybe most!) of your overseas 
income is exempt from tax in Canada.
Calculate the credit amount on form T626 and then carry it to line 
426 of schedule 1.
 
If you have severed your ties with Canada and become a non-resi-
dent, you will not be eligible for the credit because your income as 
a non-resident generally will not be taxable in Canada.
True North Strong and Free: Claim 
the Northern Residents Deduction
Rainy Hollow, B.C.; Belcher, Manitoba; Flin Flon, Saskatchewan; 
Pickle Crow, Ontario. What do these places have in common (other 
than their intriguing names)? Well, their residents can claim a 

Part II: Tips for Employees and Business Owners

northern residents deduction. In recognition of additional costs of 
living incurred by those who live in remote areas of Canada, the 
CRA allows special tax deductions to help with the extra burden.
Living in a remote area does not mean the nearest McDonald’s is 
an hour away. In fact, the CRA has a very detailed (and very long) 
list of specific areas of Canada where you have to live to claim the 
deduction.
The actual deductions you can claim depend on where you live. 
The CRA has set up two different “zones”:
 
✓ Northern zone: You are allowed the full northern residents 
deduction.
 
✓ Intermediate zone: You can deduct half the potential amount.
 
If you think you may live in a northern zone or an intermediate 
zone, check out the CRA’s publication T4039, Northern Residents 
Deductions — Places in Prescribed Zones. (You can find it on the 
CRA Web site at www.cra-arc.gc.ca.)
Two types of northern residents deductions are available:
 
✓ Residency deductions
 
✓ Travel deductions
If you qualify for the northern residents deduction, you must fill 
out form T2222, “Northern Residents Deduction,” and file it with 
your personal tax return. Keep any supporting receipts in case the 
CRA asks to see them.
Claim your residency deduction
To claim the residency deduction, you need to live exclusively 
in one of the prescribed zones. Stopping by for a visit won’t do. 
In fact, to qualify, you must have lived, on a permanent basis, in 
one of the zones for at least six consecutive months beginning or 
ending in the current year.
 
You may be able to claim two separate types of residency 
deductions:
 
✓ Basic residency amount: This is a credit for simply living in a 
zone. The credit is now $8.25 per day for living in a northern 
zone, and one-half of this, or $4.13, for living in an intermedi-
ate zone.

119
 #27: Take Advantage of Special Employment Situations
 
✓ Additional residency amount: You can claim an additional 
credit of $8.25/$4.13 per day if the following situations apply:
 
• You maintained and lived in a dwelling during your time 
up north (generally a house or apartment — sorry, a 
hotel room or bunkhouse won’t qualify).
 
• You’re the only person claiming the basic residency 
amount for living in that dwelling for that time.
You’re considered to have maintained and lived in a dwelling even 
when your employer or another person paid for your accommoda-
tions and other costs relating to the dwelling.
 
If more than one taxpayer lived in the same dwelling at the same 
time during the year, either each taxpayer can claim the basic resi-
dency amount deduction ($8.25 or $4.13 per day), or one taxpayer 
can claim both the basic residency amount deduction and the 
additional residency deduction.
 
If you’re considered to receive a non-taxable benefit for board and 
lodging at a special work site in a northern or intermediate zone, 
the non-taxable benefit (as reported on your T4 or T4A slip) is to 
be deducted in calculating your residency deduction.
 
If you received non-taxable board and lodging benefits but the spe-
cial work site is more than 30 kilometres away from an urban area 
having a population of at least 40,000, you do not have to reduce 
your residency deduction.
Take your travel deductions
The second type of northern residents deduction you may be eli-
gible to claim is the travel deduction. Generally, whenever your 
employer pays for something on your behalf, you’re considered to 
have received a taxable benefit. This means that some travel ben-
efits that your employer offers to you and your family may be tax-
able. When you live in a remote northern area, the fact that your 
employer will pay for some trips for you and your family could be 
a popular employment perk. Unfortunately, it could also lead to a 
tax bill. In recognition of the costs involved in travelling in remote 
areas, some relief from the taxable benefit rules is available. You 
can claim an additional northern residents tax deduction under 
these conditions:
 
✓ You qualify to claim a northern residents deduction (although 
you don’t have to claim it to meet this criterion — qualify is 
the key word).

Part II: Tips for Employees and Business Owners  
120
 
✓ You were an employee.
 
✓ You received taxable travel benefits in connection with your 
employment in a northern and/or intermediate zone.
 
✓ The travel benefits have been included in your employment 
income.
 
Box 32 of your T4 slip, or box 28 of your T4A slip, will report the 
taxable travel benefits you received in the year. If you received 
non-taxable benefits, such benefits will not show up on your slips 
and you’re not eligible to claim the travel benefits deduction.
 
You must claim the travel benefits deduction in the same year that 
you report the taxable benefit received from your employer.
Types of travel qualifying for deduction
Different rules apply depending on your reasons for travelling. If 
you’re travelling for medical services that are not available where 
you live, no limit applies on the number of trips you can make in 
the year. However, if you’re travelling for any other reason, you 
can claim a deduction for only two trips a year for each member of 
your household.
If you’re claiming a travel deduction for trips made for medical rea-
sons, no one else can claim the expenditures as medical expenses 
as well.
 
If you’re travelling for medical reasons, ensure your employer 
notes this fact on your T4 or T4A slip.
 
If you’re travelling for medical reasons and cannot travel alone, 
you can claim a deduction for your travel expenses as well as those 
of another member of your household who will act as your attendant 
(assuming the other conditions for the deduction are met).
Amount of deduction available
Can you take a first-class, whirlwind trip and hope it qualifies as 
a travel deduction? Let’s not be greedy. As with many of our tax 
rules, maximum amounts that can be claimed do apply. In this 
case, the maximum deduction that can be claimed for each eligible 
trip in the year is the lowest of the following:
 
✓ The taxable employment benefit you received from your 
employer for the trip.
 
✓ The cost of the lowest return airfare available at the time of 
the trip between the airport closest to your residence and the 
nearest designated city, even if you did not travel by air, or to 
that city.

121
 #27: Take Advantage of Special Employment Situations
 
✓ The total travel expenses for the trip. These travel expenses 
include such items as:
 
• Air, train, and bus fares.
 
• Meals. Actual cost (keep your receipts) or claim a flat 
rate of $17 per meal to a maximum of $51 per day per 
person for 2008. Rates for 2009 and later years can be 
found on the CRA’s Web site at http://www.cra-arc.
gc.ca/travelcosts/.
 
• Motor vehicle expenses. You can claim motor vehicle 
expenses based on actual costs incurred, or on a fixed 
per-kilometre amount. The per-kilometre amounts are 
published in a CRA fact sheet titled Travel Expenses 
for Northern Residents Deductions, Medical, and Moving 
Expenses. You can find it on the CRA Web site at www.
cra-arc.gc.ca/travelcosts/.
 
• Hotel and motel accommodations.
 
• Other incidental expenses, such as taxis, road tolls, and 
ferry costs.
So, if you’re travelling from a northern or intermediate zone to 
Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, you’ll have to determine the airfare from 
the closest airport to your remote location to Halifax, Nova Scotia 
(which is the closest designated city to Cape Breton). This is the 
case even if you didn’t fly between these two locations, and even 
though you’re not planning on visiting Halifax! A list of designated 
cities can be found in the CRA guide entitled General Income Tax 
and Benefit Guide. 
 
If you don’t know the actual cost of the trip taken (for example, 
when you’re given free airline tickets), include the market value of 
a similar trip as the actual cost. You could determine the market 
value of such a trip by getting a quote for return airfare for a regu-
larly scheduled commercial flight on the date of your actual trip.

Cover the Self-Employment 
Essentials
W
hen you decide to go it alone, you need to make many deci-
sions and handle many tasks that may have been handled 
for you by an employer in the past. Many of these decisions and 
actions will have an effect on your taxes. In this section, we look at 
two critical aspects of self-employment: selecting a taxation year-
end, and setting aside Canada or Quebec Pension Plan contribu-
tions. (In Tip #29, we look at another important decision with tax 
ramifications: determining your business’s ownership structure.)
Choose a Taxation Year-End
Choosing a year-end for tax purposes for your small business is 
an important decision. The selection of your first year-end is gov-
erned by the date you first commence business. The business year 
cannot exceed 12 months for a proprietorship or partnership.
The majority of self-employed individuals are now required to have 
a December 31 year-end. However, self-employed individuals, as 
well as partnerships that only have individuals as partners, have 
the option of selecting an off-calendar year-end provided they use 
the “alternative method” when calculating income for tax pur-
poses. (See Tip #29 for more about partnerships.)
 
If you are self employed or an individual partner, consider whether 
the timing of your year-end can defer or save income taxes or can 
be used to coincide with a cyclical slow period in your business.
Here’s an example of how to use the “alternative method” when 
the timing of your taxation year can save taxes.
Imagine that you, as a self-employed person, started your business 
on February 1, 2006. Because you chose to have an off-calendar 
year-end of January 31, 2007,
 
✓ In 2006, you wouldn’t have an income inclusion because your 
fiscal period ended in 2007.

123
 #28: Cover the Self-Employment Essentials
 
✓ In 2007, you would have to include income for the period 
February 1, 2006 to January 31, 2007, as well as an estimate of 
income for the period February 1, 2007 to December 31, 2007. 
The estimate is based on a proration of your income for the 
year ending January 31, 2007.
 
✓ In 2008, in addition to reporting your actual income for the 
fiscal year ending January 31, 2008, you would also have to 
include a new estimate to December 31, 2008. You will be able 
to deduct the previous year’s estimate of income to December 
31, 2007.
Note that you can elect to include some income from the January 
31, 2007 fiscal year in the 2006 taxation year to maximize your 
RRSP contribution or to even out your tax burden. Any amount 
included in 2006 would be deducted on your 2007 tax return.
 
After you start using the calendar year-end method you can’t 
change to the alternative method. However, you can switch to the 
calendar-year method at any time.
Pay CPP on Self-Employment 
Earnings
You will often hear employees grumble about seeing how much 
money they “lose” to CPP/QPP contributions, but it’s self-
employed people who really understand the true cost.
If you’re self-employed, you’re required to pay both the employer 
and employee portion of CPP/QPP contributions to a maximum. 
For 2009, that maximum was $4,237 ($2,118 × 2). Ouch! (As an 
employee you only pay half ($2,118) and the company you work for 
pays the other half.)
If you think of your contribution to CPP as forced savings for 
retirement rather than just another tax making the payment is 
somewhat less painful. Trying to make you feel better here!
 
The maximum CPP contribution increases each year. See the CRA 
Web site at www.cra-arc.gc.ca/tx/bsnss/tpcs/pyrll/
clcltng/cpp-rpc/cnt-chrt-pf-eng.html for the current 
year’s maximum contribution.

Part II: Tips for Employees and Business Owners  
124
If you have employment and self-employment earnings, the amount 
of CPP or QPP contributions that you have to make on your self-
employment earnings will depend on how much you’ve already 
contributed to the CPP or QPP as an employee. Schedule 8 of the 
T1 return will help you with these calculations.
 
Self-employed individuals can claim a deduction on line 222 of the 
T1 for the portion of CPP or QPP contributions that represents 
the employer’s share (that is, one-half of the contributions made). 
Only the portion of the CPP or QPP contributions that represent 
the employee’s portion qualify for the 15 percent federal non-
refundable tax credit.

Choose the Right Business 
Ownership Structure
B
usinesses can be operated through one of three main types 
of ownership structures: sole proprietorship, partnership, 
or corporation. The structure you choose at the start of your busi-
ness, and as the business grows, will be a key factor in the busi-
ness’s future growth, profitability, tax minimization, and cash flow. 
In this tip, we take a look at each of the options so you can choose 
the ownership structure that works best for you.
 
No matter what the form of your business ownership, you’ll want 
to purchase some type of liability insurance — in many industries 
it’s mandatory.
Operate a Sole Proprietorship
A sole proprietorship is a common business ownership structure 
when there is one owner. Unlike a partnership or a corporation, 
a sole proprietorship is not a separate legal entity — it’s simply 
treated as an extension of the owner, or the “proprietor.”
A sole proprietorship is generally the way to start any business. 
An exception may be where the business may incur significant 
liabilities — not only actual liabilities for money owed (say from 
financing start-up activities) but also potential litigation liabilities. 
The reason? When you own a sole proprietorship, you own all the 
assets of the business but you’re also responsible for all its liabili-
ties. In other words, the amount of liabilities you’re responsible for 
is “unlimited.” (Operating a business through a corporation may 
be a way to limit your liability; see Tip #30.)
The advantage of starting as a sole proprietorship is that any 
start-up losses are claimed on your personal tax return. These 
losses are deducted from your other sources of income in the year. 
Therefore, your net income and taxable income will be lower — 
meaning the taxes you pay will also be lower! Losses are generally 
bad from a cash flow point of view, but good from a tax savings 
point of view. (For more about losses, see “Claiming losses” in this 
section.)

Part II: Tips for Employees and Business Owners  
126
Checking out the advantages
A sole proprietorship has a number of advantages. These advan-
tages stem from the simplicity and low cost of setting up a sole 
proprietorship to the uncomplicated requirements of reporting the 
results for tax purposes. Here’s a detailed look at the advantages 
of a sole proprietorship:
 
✓ Ease of operation. It’s the easiest of the three business own-
ership structures.
 
✓ Simplicity of recordkeeping. However, the CRA still requires 
that you maintain a set of books separate from your personal 
affairs.
 
✓ Simplicity of income tax filing. No separate tax return is 
required. If you need an accountant to assist you with your 
personal tax return, the fees will be minimal.
 
✓ Low cost to begin business. There’s no incorporation fee. 
Depending on where you live and the name of the business 
you choose, you may need to register the business’s name.
 
✓ Opportunity to apply losses against other sources of per-
sonal income in the year the loss was incurred and the 
previous three years. Where a loss is carried back, you can 
recover some of the taxes paid in those years. (See “Claiming 
losses” in this section for more.)
 
✓ Ease of changing to an incorporated business. The income 
tax rules permit a sole proprietor to convert the business 
to an incorporated business without tax being triggered, 
provided the correct tax election is made, documented as 
required, and filed with the CRA within statutory time limits. 
It often makes sense to defer the conversion of a sole pro-
prietorship to an incorporated business until the business is 
profitable.
Dealing with the drawbacks
With every bit of sunshine comes a little rain. With the many 
advantages of a sole proprietorship come a few disadvantages:
 
✓ Your liability is unlimited. All your personal assets (your 
home, car, jewellery, and so on) are exposed to creditors, 
even though these assets are not used in the business.
 
✓ You can’t take advantage of the low corporate tax rate avail-
able on the first $500,000 of a corporation’s business (non-
investment) income provided by the tax credit referred to as 
the “small business deduction.” When compared to a corpo-

127
 #29: Choose the Right Business Ownership Structure
rate business ownership structure, fewer after-tax funds are 
available to the business owner to reinvest in the business. 
We discuss the small business deduction in detail in Tip #30.
 
✓ You can’t take advantage of the $750,000 capital gains 
exemption. To make use of the exemption the business 
must operate through a corporation. We explain the exemp-
tion below in our comments dealing with corporations. The 
exemption is also discussed in Tip #30.
You can avoid these disadvantages fairly easily. Remember that 
one of the advantages of a sole proprietorship is the ease of chang-
ing to a corporate ownership structure. So, to avoid the disadvan-
tages of a sole proprietorship, simply convert your proprietorship 
to a corporation!
Reporting income
The owner uses the following lines of the personal tax return to 
report revenues and expenses of a business operated through a 
sole proprietorship:
 
✓ Line 135 — Business income (complete form T2125, 
“Statement of Business or Professional Activities”)
 
✓ Line 137 — Professional income (complete form T2125)
 
✓ Line 139 — Commission income (again, complete form T2125)
 
✓ Line 141 — Farming income (complete form T2042, “Statement 
of Farming Activities”)
 
✓ Line 143 — Fishing income (complete form T2121, “Statement 
of Fishing Activities”).
Claiming losses
In this section we cover how to report any business losses you 
may realize in a year. Losses obviously aren’t ideal but if you have 
them making sure you use it to your best advantage can mean 
significant tax savings for current or other tax years. The story of 
Susie and her flower shop demonstrates someone making the most 
of losses.
Susie opened up her very own florist shop in Edmonton on 
January 2, 2009. Prior to opening, she went to see an accountant 
for advice on which business ownership structure she should 
use. She decided that a sole proprietorship made the most sense. 
Previously, Susie was employed by a florist shop in Red Deer, 
Alberta. Over the past five years, she has reported about $30,000 

Part II: Tips for Employees and Business Owners  
128
of taxable income each year on her personal tax returns. Susie 
expects to lose money in the first two years — $15,000 in 2009 and 
$8,000 in 2010, due to start-up costs and low revenues while she 
builds her customer base. If Susie had incorporated her florist 
shop when she started her business, the losses would be “trapped” 
in the corporation until she made a profit — three years from now, 
in 2012! At that time, the $23,000 in losses incurred in 2009 and 
2010 could be used to offset the profits in 2012.
A loss from a business, whether incorporated or not, can be used 
to offset business profits of the subsequent seven years or prior 
three years. Note that a business loss, referred to as a non-capital 
loss, can be used to offset any other type of income, including capi-
tal gains. This is in contrast to a capital loss, which can be applied 
only against capital gains. A capital loss can also be carried back 
to the three previous years. However, a capital loss carryforward 
period is indefinite. Refer to Tip #39 for comments on claiming 
losses of prior years on your tax return.
Because she has operated her business as a sole proprietorship 
from its commencement, Susie’s losses in 2009 and 2010 can be 
carried back and applied against the taxable income she reported 
in the past three years (2006, 2007, and 2008) on her personal tax 
returns. The result: She can immediately recover some of the taxes 
she paid in those years. Obviously, Susie prefers to recover some 
of the taxes now than to wait for the tax savings three years from 
now. Also let’s say Susie had, in addition to her business loss of 
$15,000 in 2009, investment income of $10,000 in 2009. Before car-
rying the loss back to 2006, Susie would first claim a portion of the 
loss against the $10,000 in investment income so no tax would be 
payable in 2009. The excess loss remaining would then be carried 
back to 2006.
To request a loss be carried back to a prior year, complete form 
T1A “Request for Loss Carryback” when you’re preparing your per-
sonal income tax return. To ensure speedy processing of your loss 
carryback request, mail your T1A to the CRA separately from your 
tax return. (If you e-file your return, you still mail a paper copy 
of the T1A to the CRA.) After a T1A is processed by CRA you’ll 
receive a Notice of Reassessment for the year in which the loss 
was carried back to. You’ll also receive a cheque!
Enter into a Partnership
A partnership is similar to a sole proprietorship, except that more 
than one owner exists; there are at least two owners, and they’re 
referred to as “partners.” Partnerships and partners comply with 
the same tax rules we all do.

129
 #29: Choose the Right Business Ownership Structure
A partnership is a separate legal entity. This contrasts with a sole 
proprietorship, which is considered merely an extension of the 
business owner. The partners determine how they will split the 
profit (or loss) of the partnership. The partnership does not pay 
any income tax. Its profit (or loss) is allocated out to the partners, 
who then become responsible for paying income tax on their share — 
or, where a loss has been allocated to them, making the best use of 
the loss in minimizing taxes.
Figuring out which type of 
partnership is for you
Three forms of partnerships exist: a general partnership, a limited 
liability partnership (LLP), and a limited partnership (LP). Each 
form has slightly different characteristics. The type of partnership 
you use will depend on the business or investment undertaking, 
your faith in the business or investment, and your faith in your 
partner’s capabilities.
General partnerships
General partnership is the most common partnership, where the 
partners are actively involved in running the business. The part-
ners share the ownership of the assets and the liabilities.
Just as with a sole proprietorship, general partners have unlim-
ited liability with respect to debts of the partnership. Even worse, 
they have “joint and several liability.” This means that if one of 
the partners can’t fund his share of the liability, creditors can still 
come after the other partners for the full debt. So, if a partner in a 
law practice messes up really badly and litigation is commenced 
against the law firm, all the other partners are on the hook for the 
potential debt even though they had nothing to do with the mess! 
This quite obvious negative characteristic of a general partnership 
has been somewhat softened by the introduction of limited liability 
partnership (LLPs).
Limited liability partnerships (LLPs)
A limited liability partnership works to limit the liability of the part-
ners in a partnership who were not responsible for the liability. In 
other words, it’s the partner(s) responsible for the liability that is 
(are) exposed to creditors.
 
The “joint and several” liability characteristic of a general partner-
ship does not exist in an LLP. Due to fairly recent changes in many 
provincial partnership laws over the past few years, many account-
ing and law firms have converted from a general partnership to an 
LLP.

Part II: Tips for Employees and Business Owners  
130
Limited partnerships (LPs)
In a limited partnership, each partner’s liability is limited to the 
investment each has made in the LP and any financial commit-
ments to which they have agreed. LPs are generally used for 
investments.
By definition, a limited partner cannot be active in the day-to-day 
running of the partnership. Each LP has one general partner. The 
general partner, usually the operator of the LP, assumes all the 
responsibilities for the LP’s debts in excess of the limited partners’ 
investments and financial commitments.
Understanding the tax implications 
of a partnership
 
The partnership itself does not file an income tax return. The 
income or loss of the partnership is allocated to the partners 
based on their agreement for sharing income and losses.
Common items claimed by partners on their tax returns include 
promotional costs such as meals and entertainment expenses, and 
automobile expenses. The partner’s “net” income or loss (partner-
ship share of income or loss, less expenses incurred personally by 
the partner) is then reported on one of lines 135, 137, 139, 141, or 
143 of their tax return.
The amount of partnership income is usually reported on the 
T2125 self-employment form that we discuss in the section 
“Operate a Sole Proprietorship.” Then the partner will deduct 
any expenses incurred by the partner personally in carrying out 
partnership duties. These expenses would be for any expense a 
partner incurred to earn his or her partnership income. A partner’s 
expense that has been paid for or reimbursed by the partnership 
cannot be claimed because it has already been taken into account 
in determining the partnership income.
Hearing the good news 
about partnerships
Using a partnership as your form of business organization offers 
many of the same advantages provided by a sole proprietorship:
 
✓ They are relatively easy to set up
 
✓ Minimal government regulations are imposed on partnerships 
(a limited liability partnership and a limited partnership have 
a few more regulations than does a general partnership)

131
 #29: Choose the Right Business Ownership Structure
 
✓ Income tax filing is simple — no separate tax return required. 
(However, form T5013, “Partnership Information Return,” and 
T5013 slips for each partner may be needed.)
 
✓ Skills of others are available to help run the business
 
✓ Risks of the business can be shared with other partners
 
✓ You can use your share of the partnership loss to shelter 
other sources of personal income from tax
 
✓ Like a sole proprietorship, it’s fairly easy to convert a partner-
ship into a corporation.
Looking into the not-so-good 
partnership news
Disadvantages of owning a business through a partnership are 
similar to the disadvantages faced by sole proprietors:
 
✓ With a general partnership, your liability is unlimited. As in 
a sole proprietorship, your personal assets are exposed to 
creditors, even if you had nothing to do with the liability. (An 
LLP works to minimize this disadvantage.)
 
✓ If relationships between partners deteriorate, it may be nec-
essary for a partner to leave the partnership — potentially a 
very unpleasant task to deal with. To minimize the unpleas-
antness, your partnership agreement should deal with how 
partner departures will be handled.
 
✓ If you’re operating your business through a partnership, 
you can’t take advantage of the low corporate tax rate avail-
able on the first $500,000 of a corporation’s business (non-
investment) income. When compared to a corporate business 
ownership structure, fewer after-tax funds may be available to 
reinvest in the partnership’s business.
 
✓ If you’re operating your business through a partnership you 
can’t take advantage of the $750,000 capital gains exemption. 
To take advantage of the exemption a corporation must be 
used for the business ownership structure.
 
Partnerships with more than five partners are required to file 
financial statements and a form T5013, “Partnership Information 
Return,” with the CRA. Also, each partner’s share of the partner-
ship’s income or loss needs to be documented on a T5013 slip 
prepared for each partner. The T5013 slip is included with the 
partner’s personal tax return.

Decide to Incorporate
A corporation is a legal entity separate and distinct from its 
owner(s) — the shareholder(s) of the corporation. A corporation 
is created under federal or provincial law. The income tax rules 
applied to federally incorporated business are identical to those 
that are incorporated under provincial legislation. Because a cor-
poration has a separate existence, it owns all the assets and is 
responsible for all liabilities of the corporation.
 
Are you currently operating your business through a sole pro-
prietorship or a partnership? Because the $750,000 capital gains 
exemption (which we discuss in Tip #30) is available only on the 
sale of shares of a corporation, consider converting your busi-
ness to a corporation only if it makes sense considering the advice 
we’ve given previously.
 
Both a sole proprietorship and a partnership can be converted to 
a corporate ownership structure without you incurring any imme-
diate income tax on the accrued capital gain of the assets of the 
proprietorship or partnership. You must make a tax election, and 
document that election by completing and filing a specific tax form 
with the CRA.

Make the Most of 
Incorporation
I
f you’re here because you think incorporation is for you but are 
fuzzy on some of the details then this tip is for you. Read on to 
learn all about the strategies that will help you to maximize the tax 
and other benefits that incorporation can offer.
Sidestep Personal Guarantees
This first benefit isn’t a tax benefit, but it’s one of the primary rea-
sons people incorporate. When a shareholder provides a creditor 
with a personal guarantee of a corporate liability, the sharehold-
er’s assets are exposed, but just in connection with the specific 
debt of the corporation. Often shareholders will be required to 
provide personal guarantees on corporate obligations such as 
bank debt, and on rental and leasing agreements for premises and 
equipment.
A request for your personal guarantee is a standard request of a 
creditor — especially when your business is a start-up or has very 
little in tangible assets. Just because you’re asked for the guaran-
tee doesn’t mean you always have to comply! Here are the steps in 
avoiding a personal guarantee:
 
✓ Get out your best negotiating skills.
 
✓ Focus your creditors on your track record.
 
✓ Highlight the successes you’ve had.
 
✓ Ensure your creditors know you’ve put a lot of money into the 
corporation, too. (The creditors won’t care about the blood, 
sweat, and tears you’ve put in — only the money.)
 
✓ Make sure your business plan contains specific, measurable, 
reachable, realistic goals.
 
✓ Let your creditors know that you have a network of savvy 
businesspeople to call on as needed — lawyers, accountants, 
information system specialists, corporate communication 
advisors, and so on.

Part II: Tips for Employees and Business Owners  
134
 
✓ Promise your creditors monthly cash flow statements and 
accounts receivable listings.
 
✓ Perhaps pledge the receivables.
 
✓ Do anything you can to avoid a personal guarantee.
What are the other ways your creditor can secure his loan? In your 
mind, does the alternative security give the creditor sufficient col-
lateral? If so, tell the creditor!
Where no personal guarantees are provided, the shareholders of 
the corporation generally have limited their liability to their invest-
ment in the business. Our lawyer friends tell us that when a share-
holder is also an officer of the corporation (officers include the 
president, vice-president, and secretary-treasurer) and acts in a 
“grossly negligent” manner, the shareholder, due to his or her role 
as an officer, can have some personal exposure to creditors.
Become a Secured Creditor 
of Your Own Corporation 
Here’s another non-tax benefit to incorporation. Even with limited 
liability, you still want to protect your investment in the incorpo-
rated business. Where you have put a significant amount of cash 
into a corporation, we recommend the following strategy to pro-
tect your investment as much as possible.
In return for the money you’ve invested in the corporation, classify 
a minimal amount as your purchase of shares of the corporation —
say, make the first $100 of your investment represent your pur-
chase of 100 common shares of the corporation.
Treat the remainder of your investment as a loan you’ve made to 
the corporation. This loan should be documented with a promis-
sory note between you and the corporation. No requirement exists 
for you to charge interest on the loan to the corporation.
Have your lawyer register the note under your province’s personal 
security act.
You will now have made yourself a secured creditor of the corpo-
ration. When things turn sour, it’s the secured creditors who get 
paid first. Unsecured creditors fight over the dregs.

135
 #30: Make the Most of Incorporation 
Take Advantage of the $750,000 
Capital Gains Exemption
 
A big advantage of owning shares of a corporation is evident when 
the shares are sold. One purpose of our income tax rules is to offer 
taxpayers incentives when they spend their money in ways the 
government likes. The government wants to encourage all of us 
to invest in shares of private Canadian-owned incorporated busi-
nesses. When shareholders sell shares of these businesses, they 
may be eligible to claim a capital gains exemption in respect of the 
gain incurred on the sale. This means that all or a portion of the 
gain is exempt from regular income tax. This is the incentive the 
government is offering to you to make these desired investments 
in Canadian business.
When shares qualify, a shareholder may find that he or she can 
receive the first $750,000 of capital gains free of regular income tax. 
(Refer to Tip #31 where we review how to claim the capital gains 
exemption.)
Take Advantage of the Small 
Business Deduction
In addition to accessing the $750,000 capital gains exemption, a 
second major advantage of operating your business through a cor-
poration is the tax savings provided by the small business deduc-
tion. The word deduction here means a deduction in corporate 
income tax. (It’s the same as saying a “tax credit.”)
Like the capital gains exemption, the small business deduction 
works as an incentive to become an entrepreneur — start a busi-
ness, hire employees, rent a warehouse, lease a fleet of trucks, 
and so on. These are all things the government wants you to do 
because they are beneficial to the Canadian economy. Also like the 
capital gains exemption, to take advantage of the small business 
deduction the business must be operated through a corporation.
The net income of a sole proprietorship or a partnership is taxed 
directly in the hands of the business owners — the proprietor 
or the partner. In Tip #2, which summarizes the top federal/pro-
vincial/territorial tax rates, you can see that the top tax rate a 
business owner could pay on sole proprietorship or partnership 
income varies from 39 percent (Alberta) to 48.25 percent (Nova 
Scotia). Taking Nova Scotia as an example, on an after-tax basis 
the business owner is left with only 51.75 cents to put back into 

Part II: Tips for Employees and Business Owners  
136
the business to fund operations. However, in most provinces and 
territories the combined federal and provincial/territorial tax rate 
applied to the first $500,000 of business income (non-investment 
income) is about 16 percent. This is referred to as the small busi-
ness deduction. The corporate tax rate on business income in 
excess of $500,000 is about 33 percent. The rate climbs to about 49 
percent where the corporation’s income is investment income.
 
If your business is a corporation, you’re required to prepare and 
file a corporate tax return and pay corporate income taxes. It’s the 
after-tax corporate funds that are available for reinvestment in the 
business or for the payment of dividends to shareholders or addi-
tional salary (a bonus) to the employees. (Who, in many cases for 
those reading this book, will be the same individuals as the share-
holders.)
Obviously, with a 16 percent tax rate on the first $500,000 of busi-
ness income, 84 cents on the dollar is available for reinvestment 
in the business — far more than the 51.75 cents remaining in the 
Nova Scotia sole proprietor’s hands.
Choose between Salary 
and Dividends
If the operators of the corporation do not wish to reinvest the 
after-corporate-tax funds in the business, the funds can be paid 
out to the operators as a bonus (which is simply treated as addi-
tional salary) or as a dividend payment to the shareholders. Either 
way, the receipt will trigger personal income tax in the recipient’s 
hands.
You may be thinking that when faced with the choice of taking a 
salary or a dividend from a corporation, you should always choose 
the dividend because it’s taxed at a lower rate. You’re correct that 
the personal tax is lower — confirm this by referring to the table in 
Tip #2, which summarizes top tax rates.
However, the corporation is not entitled to deduct a dividend 
payment in computing its taxable income. A dividend is not con-
sidered a deductible expense incurred in the process of earning 
corporate income. The payment of a dividend is considered an 
after-corporate-tax distribution of profits — therefore, no tax 
deduction to the corporation applies. A salary payment is consid-
ered a deductible expense incurred to earn income of the corpora-
tion. A salary payment is deductible in computing a corporation’s 
taxable income. A tax deduction results in a tax saving to the cor-
poration — a dividend does not.

137
 #30: Make the Most of Incorporation 
In summary, when looking at the dividend scenario you must add 
the corporate and personal tax. It’s this aggregate tax number you 
must use to compare to the personal tax on salary. In many cases, 
you’ll find the tax numbers will be almost the same. Again, this is 
referred to as the integration of the corporate and personal tax 
systems. Integration is designed to ensure business owners receive 
no tax savings or incur extra tax on funds taken out of a business 
for personal use just because they decided to use one form of busi-
ness ownership over another.
To maximize your retirement 
savings contribution room 
Salary is considered earned income for the purposes of making 
RRSP contributions, but dividends are not. To be eligible to make 
the maximum RRSP contribution of $22,000 in 2010, an individual 
needs at least $122,222 in 2009 salary. (Note: From 2010 onward 
the RRSP contribution maximum will be indexed — see the CRA 
Web site at http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/tx/ndvdls/tpcs/
rrsp-reer/cntrbtng/lmts-eng.html.) This is because one of 
the calculations in the formula to determine your maximum RRSP 
contribution limit is 18 percent of your earned income: $122,222 × 
18 percent equals $22,000. If you received only dividends in 2009, 
your 2010 RRSP contribution limit would be zero! We cover these 
aspects of RRSPs in Tips #42 and #43.
To minimize your personal tax
If you don’t want to pay any personal tax, don’t take money out of 
the corporation! Okay, okay — we understand that you need some 
money to live on. But to maximize the tax deferral of your personal 
tax, you should minimize your withdrawals from the corporation. 
The period of deferral is potentially unlimited. Where a business is 
run through a corporate ownership structure, opportunity exists 
to defer tax. As we have seen, no personal tax is payable unless 
money is taken out by the owners (shareholders) of the corpora-
tion. The personal tax part of the overall tax rate is deferred until 
money is taken out of the corporation. A corporation offers you 
flexibility in determining when your personal tax liability is trig-
gered. If personal tax rates are expected to go down, you’ll want to 
minimize the withdrawals you make from the corporation until the 
year when personal tax rates are the lowest.
If you decide to leave the after-corporate-tax funds in a corporation 
so your personal tax is deferred as long as possible, carefully con-
sider the following three tax repercussions:

Part II: Tips for Employees and Business Owners  
138
 
1. If the funds exceed the amount needed to operate the 
business of the corporation, you may be tainting your 
access to the $750,000 capital gains exemption. For the 
shares of the corporation to be QSBCS at the time of their 
sale, the corporation must have at least 90 percent of the 
market value of its assets invested in assets used to earn 
business income (that is, non-investment-type assets such 
as trucks, machinery, computers, office equipment, and so 
on). Excess cash and short-term and long-term portfolio 
investments are not considered to be used to earn busi-
ness income. Should the value of these “tainted assets” 
exceed 10 percent of the corporation’s assets at the time 
you sell the shares, those shares will not qualify for the 
$750,000 capital gains exemption. It’s imperative that the 
level of “non-business” assets of the corporation be moni-
tored on an ongoing basis. For the 24 months prior to the 
sale, the tainted assets (the investment or non-business 
assets of the corporation) cannot exceed 50 percent of the 
corporation’s total asset value.
 
2. If you invest the excess funds, the investment income 
earned by the corporation will be taxed at the full cor-
porate tax rate applied to investment income — not 
at the small business deduction tax rate. This tax rate 
may be higher than the personal marginal tax rates of the 
shareholders. If so, you will want to increase the share-
holders’ incomes so that the lower tax brackets of these 
shareholders are not “wasted.” A shareholder’s income 
can be increased if the corporation pays them more divi-
dends. No tax saving from the small business deduction 
applies because investment income is not considered to 
be “earned” from operating a business. However, the first 
$500,000 of business income continues to qualify for the 
small business deduction tax rate.
 
3. You’re exposing high-quality assets to creditors. If this 
is a concern, another company can be incorporated that 
would serve as a holding corporation for the shares of your 
operating corporation. The active corporation can pay up 
excess funds as tax-free dividends to the holding corpora-
tion. Because the funds are not being paid to an individual, 
no personal tax liability arises. The funds remain in a cor-
poration.

Sell Your Business in a 
Tax-Savvy Way
I
f you’re the owner of a small business, your company is likely 
your most valuable asset. You may have dreams of selling the 
business one day and using the proceeds to travel or invest in 
another business. Or you may be considering selling part of your 
business to a partner to reduce the amount of time you have to 
spend at the office.
Minimizing the taxes you will pay on a sale requires careful plan-
ning — especially when the economy is volatile. Even if you don’t 
intend to sell your business immediately, having a strategy in place 
gives you control so you realize the most value for all your hard 
work.
Evaluate Your Options
Two models typically exist for selling a business: the asset sale, 
and the share sale. Which model you use depends on the type of 
business and the needs of seller and buyer. Each model has differ-
ent tax consequences. Here’s a closer look at the two models:
 
✓ An asset sale, common for unincorporated businesses and 
businesses in capital-intensive industries such as transpor-
tation, is often preferred by the buyer. In an asset sale, the 
buyer purchases only the assets of a business. In so doing, 
the buyer can avoid taking on any potential corporate liabili-
ties that come with purchasing shares and may benefit from 
increased tax deductions that would not be available in a 
share deal (for example, increased capital cost allowance; see 
Tip #32).
 
✓ A share sale is often favoured by the seller. In a share sale, 
the seller sells the shares (well, duh) and reports whatever 
capital gains are realized. The great appeal of this strategy is 
that the seller may be able to take advantage of a capital gains 
tax exemption (yes, that’s right, we said tax exemption) that 
is not available in an asset deal. In the next section we look 
at the potential capital gains exemptions you need to know 
about.

Take Advantage of Qualified Small 
Business Corporation Share Status
If you own shares of a small business corporation you won’t 
want to miss this one — arguably the best tax break in Canada. 
In 2007 the government increased the capital gains exemption 
from the disposition of qualified small business corporation (QSBC) 
shares from $500,000 to $750,000. This $250,000 increase was also 
extended to the sale of qualified farm and fishing property. If you 
made use of the previous $500,000 capital gains exemption, you 
now have another $250,000 to use should you own qualified small 
business corporation shares or qualified farm or fishing property.
Just to be clear — when you sell shares of a QSBC, the first 
$750,000 of proceeds you receive on the sale of your business may 
be exempt from tax. Check with your tax professional.
Understand the term “qualified 
small business corporation”
We won’t go into excruciating detail, but note that a share of a 
corporation will be considered to be a QSBC share if the following 
criteria are met:
 
✓ At the time of sale, it was a share of the capital stock of a 
Canadian controlled private corporation (CCPC), and it was 
owned by you, your spouse, or a partnership of which you 
were a member.
 
✓ At least 90 percent of the corporation’s assets at market value 
were used by the corporation in an active (for example, non-
rental, non-investment) business.
 
✓ Throughout the 24 months immediately before you disposed 
of the share, it was a share of a CCPC and more than 50 per-
cent of the market value of the assets of the corporation were 
used mainly in an active business carried on primarily in 
Canada.
 
✓ Throughout the 24 months immediately before you disposed 
of the share, no one other than you, a partnership of which 
you were a member, or a person related to you owned the 
share.

141
 #31: Sell Your Business in a Tax-Savvy Way
Know how to report a 
tax-exempt gain
You report the capital gain or loss realized on the sale of QSBC 
shares in section 1 of schedule 3, “Qualified small business corpo-
ration shares.” A $750,000 capital gain would become a $375,000 
taxable capital gain and be reported on line 127 of your return. If 
the full $750,000 capital gain qualifies for the $750,000 capital gains 
exemption, you would be able to claim a $375,000 capital gains 
deduction. Claim it on line 254 of your return and include form 
T657, “Calculation of Capital Gains Deduction.” The line 254 deduc-
tion in computing taxable income would offset the line 127 inclu-
sion in taxable income.
Be sure to visit a tax professional if you think your shares may 
qualify for the capital gains exemption. Even if they don’t currently 
qualify, it’s possible to “purify” the corporation of assets not con-
sidered to be active business assets, such as cash or investments, 
so that you will be eligible for this exemption when the time arises 
to sell the shares. This is one not to miss — get the help you need 
to make sure you take advantage of this strategy!
 
If you own QSBC shares, consider crystallizing — or locking in — 
your qualified small business corporation capital gains exemption 
now. You never know when the government might repeal the 
exemption, or when the rules listed above may no longer apply to 
your corporation.
 
If you operate your business as a sole proprietorship or partner-
ship, you can’t access the capital gains exemption when you sell. 
You may be able to transfer your unincorporated business into an 
incorporated entity prior to a sale in order to make possible a sale 
of shares and in doing so be able to use the QSBC share exemp-
tion. Again — you’ll need professional help for this one.
Determine whether you may owe 
alternative minimum tax
 
When using the capital gains exemption, be wary of the implica-
tions of alternative minimum tax (AMT). The capital gain may be 
tax-free for “regular” tax but could result in AMT. What is AMT, 
you ask? It’s a special tax that’s charged when someone has a high 
amount of gross income but many favourable tax deductions, or 
“tax preferences” (in the eyes of the CRA, that is), resulting in a 
significantly reduced (again, in the eyes of the CRA) tax liability for 
the year.

Part II: Tips for Employees and Business Owners  
142
The types of deductions that may lead you to pay minimum tax 
include limited-partnership losses, resource expenses, and stock 
option deductions. If you have these types of deductions on your 
tax return, fill out form T691, “Alternative Minimum Tax,” to see 
whether the minimum tax will apply to you. If it does, don’t fret. 
You can use that minimum tax to offset regular taxes payable in 
any of the next seven years. Assuming you pay regular tax during 
those years, you will get your money back — consider it a prepay-
ment of your future tax bill. Minimum tax is often more of a cash-
flow issue than a true income tax.
Shelter Capital Gains 
If You’re a Farmer
The special $750,000 capital gains exemption is also available if 
you sell qualified farm property. The property will qualify when it 
meets either of these tests:
 
✓ The property must be used by you, your spouse, child, or 
grandparents in the 24 months immediately before you sell, 
and your gross revenue from the farming business must 
exceed your income from all other sources for a minimum of 
two years.
 
✓ The property must be used by a corporation or partnership 
where the principal business is farming for a minimum of 24 
months prior to the sale.
Qualified farm property includes the following:
 
✓ An interest in a family-farm partnership that you or your 
spouse owns
 
✓ A share of the capital stock of a family-farm corporation that 
you or your spouse owns
 
✓ Real property, such as land and buildings, and eligible capital 
property, such as milk and egg quotas
You, your spouse, or a family-farm partnership must own the farm 
property. If a corporation or partnership carries on the farming 
business, the property will qualify if you, your spouse, or your 
child is an active participant in the business and more than 50 per-
cent of the market value of the property is used in the business of 
farming. Generally, when you dispose of qualified farm property, 
you report any capital gain or loss realized in the special section 
of part 2 of schedule 3, “Qualified farm property and qualified fish-
ing property.” If you dispose of farm property other than qualified 

143
 #31: Sell Your Business in a Tax-Savvy Way
farm property, report any capital gain or loss in part 4 of schedule 
3, “Real estate, depreciable property and other properties.”
 
If you transfer farm property to a child, it may be possible to com-
pletely avoid tax on the disposition. Consult a tax professional, 
who can determine whether you can take advantage of a “tax-free 
intergenerational transfer.”
Determining whether your farm property qualifies for the $750,000 
capital gains exemption is not a do-it-yourself project. The tax 
rules surrounding farm property are quite complex (definitely not 
bedtime reading material), so a visit to a tax professional is a must.
 
Be cautious of the AMT implications whenever you make use of the 
capital gains exemption.
Shelter Capital Gains
 If You’re a Fisher
The $750,000 lifetime capital gains exemption we discuss in this 
tip is also available for dispositions of qualified fishing property. In 
addition, a tax-deferred intergenerational rollover is also available 
for transfers of qualified fishing property to a child or grandchild.
 
Be wary of the AMT implications when claiming the capital gains 
exemption.
 
If you own shares of a qualified small business corporation, quali-
fied farm property, or qualified fishing property with accrued 
gains, you can trigger the gain by means of an actual sale to a third 
party or by transferring the asset to your spouse (if you transact 
at fair market value) or to a corporation you control. And we know 
we’ve said it before, but we feel strongly that taking proper advan-
tage of these potentially huge tax breaks means getting profes-
sional advice.
Defer Capital Gains on Eligible 
Small Business Investments
Have you sold shares of a small business corporation during the 
year? If so, then read on. Even if you’ve used up the $750,000 capi-
tal gains exemption, it’s still possible to defer tax if you sell certain 
share investments and then replace those investments with new 
eligible small business investments.

Part II: Tips for Employees and Business Owners  
144
To be eligible for this deferral, the shares you dispose of or 
repurchase must be of a Canadian-controlled private corporation 
(CCPC) that used at least 90 percent of the market value of its 
assets in an active business in Canada.
 
Time limits apply to this tax deferral. First, you must have held 
the original shares for more than 185 days. In addition, you must 
acquire the replacement shares at any time in the year of disposi-
tion or within 120 days after the year-end.
 
If you manage to defer your capital gain because of this rule, you 
must remember to decrease the adjusted cost base (ACB) of the 
“new” investment. You must do a number of calculations to come 
up with the exact ACB reduction. Take a look at the CRA’s guide 
Capital Gains (T4037).
 
The rules for calculating the actual amount of gain you can defer 
are quite complex (trust us, you don’t want us to go into them 
here). If you need to use this deferral, we strongly recommend get-
ting a professional accountant involved.

Maximize Your Capital Cost 
Allowance (CCA) Claim
T
he money you spend in operating your business can be classi-
fied in one of two ways:
 
✓ Day-to-day expenditures of running the business: These 
expenditures are not considered to have a future value and 
are therefore “expenses” of your business. Most of these 
expenses are noted on lines 8521 to 9270 on form T2125. 
Examples of day-to-day expenditures include salaries paid to 
employees, office rent, lease payments, bank charges, travel, 
and telephone.
 
✓ Capital expenditures: Capital expenditures are made when 
you purchase a capital asset — an asset that has an expected 
useful life that will extend beyond the end of your business’s 
taxation year. Common examples of capital assets are com-
puters, office equipment (photocopiers, printers), office furni-
ture, buildings, and machinery.
Because the value provided by these assets is expected to extend 
past the end of your business taxation year, you cannot take a full 
deduction for these expenditures in one year. However, you’re 
allowed to deduct a portion of the cost of a capital asset for each 
taxation year it is used in your business. The calculation of the 
portion that can be deducted on your tax return is called capital 
cost allowance (CCA).
In this tip, we get up close and personal with the CCA, giving you 
the scoop you need to know to make it work for you.
Understanding Capital 
Cost Allowance
Capital cost allowance, or CCA, is simply tax lingo for “deprecia-
tion” and “amortization.” These are terms often used by accoun-
tants. Remember this the next time you are at a party and want to 
impress someone with your vast knowledge!

Part II: Tips for Employees and Business Owners  
146
 
Your business can claim CCA on almost all capital assets pur-
chased (one exception is land). And, of course, the asset must 
have been acquired for use in your business — not for personal 
use.
 
Eligible capital property (ECP) describes assets that do not physi-
cally exist. They are referred to as intangible assets and include 
such items as the purchase of goodwill, a customer or patient list, 
a marketing quota or government right, and an unlimited franchise, 
concession, or licence. Technically, you don’t claim CCA on ECP, 
but a special deduction similar to CCA is allowed. The starting 
point for the deduction is 75 percent of the cost of ECP. The deduc-
tion you are allowed is 7 percent of this amount, on a declining 
basis each year.
Calculating CCA — the Declining 
Balance Method
For most types of assets, you calculate CCA using the declining bal-
ance method of depreciation. The costs of specific types of assets 
(generally the purchase price, but can also include freight costs, 
duty and customs fees, retail sales taxes, and even GST/HST when 
your business is not a GST/HST registrant) are grouped together in 
CCA classes to calculate the CCA deduction. The government dic-
tates which “class” specific types of assets go into and the percent-
age rates used to calculate the CCA for each class.
For example, say your business purchased a meeting room table 
and a bunch of chairs. The table and chairs, both being “office 
furniture,” would be treated as one asset, or “class.” CCA is then 
calculated on the class balance using a legislated percentage 
rate. The remaining “class balance” (referred to as the undepreci-
ated capital cost or UCC, discussed below) is carried to the next 
year, where again the same percentage is applied to calculate the 
CCA. Because the class balance on which the CCA claim is based 
declines each year, the method is referred to as the declining bal-
ance method. This method results in higher CCA deductions in the 
early years of a capital asset purchase and lower amounts as the 
asset ages.
 
If your business incurs costs to make rented premises more 
workable, such costs are referred to as leasehold improvements. 
Leasehold improvements are not depreciated using a percentage 
and the declining balance method. Instead, CCA is calculated as 
the lesser of the following:

147
 #32: Maximize Your Capital Cost Allowance (CCA) Claim
cost of leasehold improvements
5
cost of leasehold improvements
# of years in lease
+
 
# years in first renewal period
 
To maximize the speed at which CCA is claimed on your leasehold 
improvements, negotiate your lease to be a maximum of four years 
with a renewal period of one year.
CCA is calculated on the balance of the CCA class as of the last day 
of your business’s taxation year. You do not need to separate CCA 
calculations for capital assets owned for only part of a taxation 
year (although the “half-year rule,” which we discuss later, does 
take care of assets purchased during the year). However, if you 
were not in business for the full year (say you just started up on 
September 1), you do need to prorate your CCA for your shorter-
than-365-day year. In this case, you would take your total CCA 
times 122 days/365 days. (For more about taxation years, check 
out Tip #28.)
Common CCA classes and rates
 
For simplicity, the government has assigned CCA class numbers to 
similar groups of assets (CCA classes):
 
✓ Buildings: Class 1:
 
• 4 percent (general rate)
 
• 6 percent (if non-residential)
 
• 10 percent (if used in manufacturing or processing in 
Canada)
 
✓ Fences: Class 6: 10 percent
 
✓ Office equipment and furniture: Class 8: 20 percent
All capital assets eligible for CCA are included in class 8 if 
they do not fall into any of the other CCA classes.
 
✓ Cars (less than $30,000) and trucks: Class 10: 30 percent
 
✓ Cars ($30,000 and more): Class 10.1: 30 percent (Refer to the 
section “Restriction on the maximum capital cost of a class 
10.1 automobile” in this tip.)
 
✓ Computer hardware and systems software acquired before 
March 23, 2004: Class 10: 30 percent

Part II: Tips for Employees and Business Owners  
148
 
✓ Computer hardware and systems software acquired after 
March 22, 2004: Class 45: 45 percent
 
✓ Computer hardware and systems software acquired after 
March 18, 2007: Class 50: 55 percent
 
✓ Computer hardware and systems software acquired after 
January 27, 2009 and before February 2011: The January 27, 
2009 budget provided for a temporary increase from 55 to 100 
percent. This 100 percent CCA rate will not be subject to the 
half-year rule. As a result of this measure, a business will be 
able to fully deduct the cost of an eligible computer (including 
the systems software for that computer) in the first year that 
CCA deductions are available.
 
✓ Computer application software, uniforms, linens, dies, jigs, 
moulds, and rental videos with a cost of under $200 and 
tools with a cost of less than $500: Class 12: 100 percent
 
✓ Manufacturing and processing equipment: Class 43: 30
percent (however, if the equipment is purchased after March 
19, 2007, and before 2009 it is considered class 29, with a 50 
percent rate calculated on a straight-line-depreciation basis, 
not the regular declining-balance basis.)
A CCA example
CCA can best be explained through an example. Imagine your busi-
ness purchased a meeting room table and chairs. The total cost 
of the furniture was $1,200. In preparing your tax return you know 
that you cannot deduct the full $1,200 on form T2125 in determin-
ing your net income from self-employment. The meeting room table 
and chairs are good quality and probably can be used in your busi-
ness for several years. In fact, the chairs have a 10-year warranty!
Office furniture is considered a CCA class 8 capital asset with a 
CCA rate of 20 percent. (You’re forced to accept the 20 percent 
rate whether the chairs are expected to last 5 years, 10 years, or 30 
years.)
You would think you could calculate CCA as simply 20 percent of 
$1,200, or $240. However, there’s a catch — a special rule called 
the “half-year rule,” which dictates that when calculating CCA for 
the year in which the asset is purchased, only one-half (or 50 per-
cent) of the CCA can be claimed. So, the correct way to calculate 
the 2008 CCA claim on the office furniture is $1,200 × 20% × 50% = 
$120.

149
 #32: Maximize Your Capital Cost Allowance (CCA) Claim
Undepreciated capital cost (UCC)
Undepreciated capital cost is the term used to describe the 
amount of the capital cost at the end of a taxation year to which 
CCA has not yet been applied. In our CCA class 8 office furniture 
example from the previous section, the UCC at December 31, 2009, 
would be $1,080. It is calculated as follows:
Undepreciated capital cost (UCC) at
January 1, 2009 (assumed)
$nil
Capital cost of additions in 2009
$1,200
Capital cost allowance (CCA) claimed 
in 2009
$120/1,200 × 20% × 50%
Undepreciated capital cost (UCC) at
December 31, 2009
$1,080
In 2010, assuming no further purchases or sales are made, CCA 
of $216 ($1,080 × 20%) can be claimed. The half-year rule applied 
only to assets of a CCA class purchased in a year. Because we are 
assuming no CCA class 8 assets were acquired in 2010, the half-
year rule does not come into play!
Let’s imagine now that your business hits the big time and you 
have money to burn. Naturally your first step (well maybe not 
first) is to upgrade your office furniture. Say you decide to upgrade 
the meeting room table and chairs in 2010. Your new table and 
chairs cost $1,700. The old table and chairs were sold to a used 
office furniture retailer for $750. We’ll stick with our CCA class 8 
office furniture example to show what happens when an asset used 
in your business is sold.
Sale of capital assets
When a capital asset is sold, the UCC is reduced by the lower of 
the following:
 
✓ The original capital cost of the assets sold (remember, this 
was $1,200)
 
✓ The sale price — the $750 noted above

Part II: Tips for Employees and Business Owners  
150
When an asset is sold, the half-year rule comes into play once 
again.
UCC at January 1, 2010 (same as at December 31, 2009)

Add: Additions

 ($1,700 – $750) × 20% × 50% = $95
($311)
Closing UCC
$1,719 (UCC at 
December 31, 2010)
 
When you purchase and dispose of an asset in the same CCA class 
during the year, you must net the addition and disposal together 
before applying the half-year rule.
Recapture and terminal loss
As long as assets are purchased for a higher cost than the sale 
price of previously purchased assets, the UCC will never reduce 
to nil. However, what if your business sells all the assets in a CCA 
class and does not replace them? Well, two things can happen, 
which we consider in this section.
Let’s imagine now that you decide not to upgrade your meeting 
room table and chairs. You admit to yourself that you don’t like 
meeting clients, so the best way not to meet clients is to get rid of 
your meeting room furniture. (Perhaps not a good career move, 
but it works with the example.)
Selling all the assets in a class for 
less than the UCC balance
Remember, the table and chairs originally cost $1,200. Again, 
assume you sell the whole set for $750. In this case, the following 
would happen:

151
 #32: Maximize Your Capital Cost Allowance (CCA) Claim
Opening UCC at January 1, 2010 (same as UCC 
at December 31, 2009) $1,080
Sale of chairs:
Lesser of:
 Original cost:
$1,200
 Proceeds:
$750
Lesser:
($750)
UCC balance after sale
$330
Because you sold all the assets in this class, you shouldn’t have 
any UCC left — nothing is left to depreciate. However, you have 
$330 remaining. What this means is that you didn’t depreciate the 
assets fast enough. Therefore, the taxman lets you make this up 
by allowing you to claim the full amount remaining as a deduction. 
After all, you were only using the rate they set — why shouldn’t 
you get the deduction? The $330 is referred to as the terminal loss 
and is fully tax deductible as part of your total CCA claim.
Next up in the ongoing saga of the office furniture? Well it turns out 
that the designer of the furniture you bought wins a prestigious 
award and her furniture, even used, becomes all the rage. What 
happens if you sell it for more than you paid for it? (Nice move by 
the way!)
Selling the assets for more than the UCC balance
What happens if you sell the table and chairs for $1,800? Sounds 
good, but a downfall does exist. Let’s look at the
calculation again:
UCC at January 1, 2010 (same as UCC at December 31, 2009) 
$1,080
Sale of chairs:
Lesser of:
 Original cost:
$1,200
 Proceeds:
$1,800
Lesser:
($1,200)
UCC balance after sale
($120)

Part II: Tips for Employees and Business Owners  
152
See what’s happened? Again, you sold everything in the asset pool, 
so your UCC balance should clear to zero. However, you have a 
negative UCC balance. This means you’ve taken too much CCA — 
the assets did not depreciate as fast as the taxman thought they 
would. Obviously, the CRA won’t let you have too much of a good 
thing, so it will ask for the extra CCA that you took back (hence the 
term “recapture”) by adding the negative UCC to your income in 
the year the asset is disposed.
If you sell an asset for more than its original cost, you may also 
have a capital gain to report. See Tip #46 for more details.
Restriction on the maximum capital 
cost of a class 10.1 automobile
The government does not want you driving an expensive car and 
being able to write off a significant portion in CCA in determining 
your self-employment income. Therefore, the amount of CCA that 
can be claimed on an automobile is restricted in certain situa-
tions. If you buy a car where the cost exceeds a certain threshold 
amount, that car cannot go in the regular class 10 for CCA purposes. 
Instead, it must go into a special class — namely class 10.1 — where 
special rules apply. The threshold amounts are shown in Table 
22-4 in Tip #22.
As you can see, if you buy a car in 2009 that costs more than 
$30,000, you’ll be allowed to use only $30,000 as your capital cost. 
The excess can never be written off for tax purposes. The CRA 
periodically adjusts the maximum amount to take into account 
rising car prices.
Special rules in calculating CCA 
on class 10.1 automobiles
Keep in mind a few special rules when you’re tallying up CCA on 
your class 10.1 automobile. Have a look to see whether any of 
these circumstances apply to you:
 
✓ Calculate CCA on each car on its own. If your business used 
two cars and they both had an actual capital cost above the 
limits, your business would have two CCA class 10.1 calcula-
tions to make. The purchase or sale of one class 10.1 automo-
bile does not impact the CCA calculation of another CCA class 
10.1 automobile.

153
 #32: Maximize Your Capital Cost Allowance (CCA) Claim
 
✓ Unlike other capital assets, when you sell a class 10.1 automo-
bile, you don’t have to calculate recapture or terminal loss. 
(We discuss how recapture and terminal loss are calculated 
under “Recapture and terminal loss” in this tip.)
 
✓ Normally, when you sell an asset you’re not allowed to claim 
CCA on that asset. However, for a class 10.1 asset, a special 
rule allows you to claim one-half of the CCA you would have 
otherwise been allowed to deduct had you continued to own 
the asset.

Be a Tax Winner Even When 
You Realize a Loss
F
iling a tax return is one time when being a loser is to your 
advantage. If you’ve incurred losses (including limited part-
nership losses, non-capital losses, and net capital losses) in prior 
years, and were unable to use those losses on your prior years’ 
tax returns, you are allowed to carry those losses forward to offset 
some of your current income.
 
If you’ve had losses in the past, you may be able to use those 
losses on your current year’s tax return to offset your taxable 
income and reduce your tax bill! If you’re unsure what your 
unclaimed loss balance is, give the CRA a call. If you forget to claim 
an amount, the CRA will not apply your unused losses to your cur-
rent income, because these are optional deductions.
Depending on the type of loss you’ve incurred, limitations may 
exist on the amount of loss you can carry forward, and on the 
number of years it can be carried forward.
 
It’s generally most beneficial to apply a prior year’s loss to income 
that’s taxed at a high rate. For example, if your income is low this 
year but is expected to increase in future years, you may want to 
forgo claiming the loss carried forward this year. Instead, you can 
save the loss for a future year when you know you’ll be subject to 
a higher tax rate. Of course, because certain types of losses have a 
limited carryforward period (we discuss this in a moment), you’ll 
want to be absolutely certain you’ll be able to use the loss in future 
years. If there’s any doubt, claim the loss this year — use it, don’t 
lose it — even if you’re in a low tax bracket.
 
Never claim losses to bring your taxable income to zero. Although 
you’ll have no tax to pay with taxable income of zero, you’d also 
have no tax to pay if you report income equal to your non-refund-
able tax credits.

155
 #33: Be a Tax Winner Even When You Realize a Loss
Limited-Partnership Losses
Limited partnerships are most commonly purchased as tax shel-
ters. A limited partner, as opposed to a general partner, has lim-
ited liability with respect to the partnership’s liabilities. The main 
reason (but perhaps not the best reason) for investing in a limited 
partnership is often the up-front tax losses allocated to partners. 
(For more about limited partnerships, see Tip #29.)
Although some of these partnerships eventually make a profit, 
often huge losses occur in the first years. These losses are passed 
on to investors (the partners), to be deducted on their personal 
tax returns. The tax authorities are not fans of limited partnerships 
in general, and the tax laws limit the amount of losses you can 
claim. Specifically, investors can deduct cumulative losses only up 
to the investor’s “at-risk amount.”
Your at-risk amount is the amount you paid to purchase the limited 
partnership, plus any further capital contributions you made to the 
partnership (in other words, your tax cost of the limited-partnership 
investment). Put more succinctly, you can deduct losses on your 
tax return only up to the amount that you paid (including any loans 
you’ve incurred) for your partnership interest.
If you’ve received form T5013, “Statement of Partnership Income,” 
from your limited partnership in the year, your at-risk amount 
should be reported in box 45. If not, contact the partnership and 
ask them for details of this amount — this is something the part-
nership should track.
 
If your cumulative limited-partnership losses exceed your at-risk 
amount, you can carry the remaining losses forward for possible 
future use. You can deduct the additional losses to offset income 
produced by the partnership or to offset any additional capital you 
contributed to the partnership. Limited-partnership losses can be 
carried forward indefinitely. No expiry applies.
 
Your limited-partnership losses available for carryover will be 
reported in box 31 of your T5013 slip. This is the amount that can’t 
be deducted on your current year’s tax return, but can be carried 
forward to offset limited partnership income in the future.
 
If you have a limited-partnership loss that does not exceed your 
at-risk amount, this loss can be used to offset income from any 
source in the current year. In fact, the loss must be used this year 
if it can be. If not, it becomes part of your non–capital loss bal-
ance and can be carried back for up to three years to offset a prior 

Part II: Tips for Employees and Business Owners  
156
year’s taxable income, or carried forward for 20 years. But don’t 
forget — if any portion of the loss can’t be used because of the at-
risk rules, it can only be carried forward to offset against limited-
partnership income in the future, unless you increase the at-risk 
amount of your limited-partnership investment.
Non-capital Losses
In general, any business, employment, or property transaction is 
considered non-capital. (See Tip #39 for a discussion of net capital 
losses.) So, if you have your own business and it generates a loss, 
this is considered to be a non-capital loss. In addition, if you’ve 
incurred an allowable business investment loss, otherwise known 
as an ABIL (see the next section for further details), this is also 
considered to be a non-capital loss.
The amount of non-capital loss that is generated in a particular tax 
year is calculated on form T1A, “Request for Loss Carryback.” This 
is also the form that allows you to carry back any current-year 
losses to prior tax years, and that reports the amount of the loss 
that can be carried forward to future years.
Form T1A is important because not all items on your tax return are 
figured into the calculation of your non-capital loss. Therefore, if 
you have a negative net income or taxable income amount (which 
is actually reported as a zero balance on lines 236 and 260 of your 
tax return), fill out form T1A so you know how much of the losses 
can be carried over to other tax years.
After the CRA receives and processes your form T1A, it will reas-
sess the year to which you carried the loss back . . . and send you a 
tax refund cheque!
Items included in non-capital losses
The items included in the calculation of non-capital losses on your 
tax return are as follows:
 
✓ Employment income/loss: This includes lines 101 and 104, 
less any amounts reported on lines 207, 212, 229, and 231.
 
✓ Investment income/loss: Add together lines 120 and 121 and 
deduct any amount reported on line 221.
 
✓ Partnership income/loss: This includes any amounts 
reported on line 122. Note that only the allowable loss (not 
the restricted portion of the limited partnership loss) is 
included on this line.

157
 #33: Be a Tax Winner Even When You Realize a Loss
 
✓ Rental income/loss: This is reported on line 126.
 
✓ Business, professional, or commission income or losses: 
These are reported on lines 135, 137, and 139.
 
✓ Farming or fishing income or losses: These are reported on 
lines 141 and 143. The amount of farming losses you can claim 
may be restricted if farming is not your chief source of income 
for the year (see Tip #29).
 
✓ Taxable capital gains: This is reported on line 127.
 
✓ Non-taxable income: This is reported on line 147.
 
✓ Net capital losses of other years: This is reported on line 253.
 
✓ Certain other deductions: These include the capital gains 
deduction, deduction for business investment losses, 
employee home-relocation loan deduction, stock option and 
shares deductions, other payments deduction, and income 
exempt under a tax treaty. Amounts are reported on lines 254, 
217, 248, 249, and 250.
Form T1A requires you to separate the income and loss items on 
your tax return. For example, any deductions claimed would be 
placed in the “loss” column. You must then total all the income 
and loss items separately.
If you’ve claimed any amounts on lines 208, 209, 214, 215, 219, 
220, 232, or 235 of your tax return, these amounts are deducted 
from your total income. It’s possible that these deductions will 
cause you to have negative income; however, these amounts do 
not result in a non-capital loss. If the deductions claimed on these 
lines result in negative income (before taking into account allow-
able deductions in the loss column), your total income is deemed 
to be nil. You then take your total income, less the total amount 
reported in the loss column, to calculate the net loss for the year. 
You must then deduct any farming or fishing losses incurred in the 
year to come up with your total non-capital loss available for carry-
over. This amount can be carried back to offset taxable income in 
any of the previous three taxation years, or carried forward.
Calculate non-capital losses
Here’s an example to help you understand how to calculate non-
capital losses. Pam had more tax deductions than income in the 
2008 tax year. She would like to know if she can take advantage 
of her losses on her 2009 tax return. Here is a summary of items 
claimed on her 2008 tax return:

Pam’s 2008 non-capital loss is calculated as follows. Note that “per-
sonal” streams of income and deductions are handled separately 
from the business loss.

$9,000
$9,000
Pam can carry forward the 2008 $9,000 non-capital loss to 2009 to 
reduce her 2009 taxable income.
Non-capital losses can be carried forward for 20 years. However, 
consider carrying your losses back (up to three years back), if 
possible, to receive a tax benefit from the loss sooner rather than 
later.
 
If you’re certain you will have taxable income in the future, you 
may want to forgo a loss carryback and instead carry the losses 
forward to offset your future income. It’s always most beneficial to 
claim the losses against income taxed at the highest marginal tax 
rate. So, if you’re expecting to generate significant income in the 
future that will be taxed at a higher marginal tax rate than you’re 
subject to this year, you may want to keep the losses intact until 
you’re in that higher tax bracket.
Use Business Investment Losses 
(BIL) to Your Advantage
A capital loss occurs when you sell an investment for less than 
you paid for it. A capital loss can be used only to shelter or offset 
capital gains from tax — it cannot be used to shelter other types 
of income (say, employment income, pension income, interest, or 
dividends) from tax.

159
 #33: Be a Tax Winner Even When You Realize a Loss
A business investment loss (BIL) is a special type of capital loss. 
A business investment loss, or a portion of that loss, can be 
deducted in the year incurred to shelter any type of income — not 
just capital gains — from tax.
 
A BIL occurs when you sell your shares or debt in a small business 
corporation at a loss. (Refer to Tip #31 for a discussion of small 
business corporation shares.) A BIL will also arise if you were 
deemed to dispose of the shares or debt when the corporation 
became bankrupt, insolvent, or no longer carried on business and 
the fair market value of the shares became nil.
Calculating the deductible 
portion of the BIL
Report your true loss on line 228 of your return. This is the differ-
ence between your proceeds of disposition (which may be nil!) and 
the tax cost of the investment (which is normally what you paid for 
the investment). However, as with capital losses, only 50 percent 
of a BIL is tax deductible. This is logical because only 50 percent 
of the gain on the sale of an investment is taxable. The deductible 
portion of a BIL is referred to as an allowable business investment 
loss (ABIL).
Reducing your BIL for past 
capital gains deductions
If you’ve used any portion of your capital gains deduction (see 
Tips #30 and #31), this will reduce the amount of the BIL that you 
can deduct. After any necessary reductions in the amount of the 
loss are calculated, the remaining loss to be deducted on your cur-
rent year’s tax return is reported on line 217.
 
Although you can carry a non-capital loss back 3 years and for-
ward 20 years (see previous section), these rules do not apply to 
a non-capital loss resulting from an ABIL. Instead, an ABIL that has 
not been used within 10 tax years will in the 11th year become a 
net capital loss that can be carried forward indefinitely against tax-
able capital gains.

t’s often said that it doesn’t matter what your invest-
ments return; it’s the after-tax returns that matter 
most. The problem is that taxes can seem overwhelming 
when you are an investor. First, the tax rules are different 
depending on the type of investment account you choose. 
You could have a registered account, a non-registered 
account, a tax-free savings account, or maybe you invest 
in insurance products or in property or other assets. 
Furthermore, investment income is taxed differently 
depending on the type of income you are generating. 
Think about it. You might have a rental property and earn 
rental income as well as incur rental expenses. Maybe you 
like the stock markets and buy stocks that pay you divi-
dends and generate capital gains and losses. Perhaps you 
like to play it safe and earn interest income on bonds and 
cash like investments. And don’t even start on the rules 
for foreign investments!
Take a deep breath — help is on the way in the form of 
Part III. We give you tips broken down by the different 
types of investment accounts, and investment types so 
you can stick to the facts for your personal situation. So 
highlight, bookmark, and tag these pages! Do anything you 
have to do to remind yourself of the many ways to save 
tax as an investor!

Minimize Tax on Your 
Investment Income
W
e often hear people say, “My taxes are too high. What can 
I do to reduce them?” Although we don’t have the magi-
cal solution that will make your tax bill disappear, we can suggest 
some things you can do to reduce the amount you pay, particularly 
if you’re an investor.
Tax efficiency doesn’t matter when you own only registered invest-
ments (Tips #42 and #43) or have a Tax-Free Savings Account
(Tip #41). Why? Earnings in these accounts accumulate tax free 
regardless of the type of return. You’re taxed on your registered 
accounts only when you make withdrawals, and even then the type 
of underlying investment doesn’t matter. The full withdrawal is 
taxed at your full marginal tax rate (Tip #1). Withdrawals from Tax-
Free Savings Account are tax free.
Investment returns in a non-registered account are not created 
equal in the eyes of the taxman. In fact, the amount of tax you 
pay depends on the type of income your investment is earning, 
whether that’s dividends, capital gains, or interest.
Always weigh your investment and tax objectives before making 
any investment decision. Even though a particular investment suits 
you tax-wise, it may not fit your investment-risk profile. In this tip,
we show you that when you use registered, tax-free, and non-
registered investment accounts you can decide where to hold your 
different investments for the ultimate tax efficiency.
Choose the Best Location 
for Your Investments
You may be lucky enough to have accumulated, over time, invest-
ment assets in registered, non-registered, and Tax Free Savings 
accounts. Some Canadians also have investment holding compa-
nies. After you have more than one “location” in which to make 
investment choices, consider where it makes the most sense, tax-
wise, to make each investment.

Part III: Tips for Investors  
164
164
First, determine your optimal asset allocation. Most people do this 
with the help of an investment advisor. It requires determining what 
percentage of your overall holdings you wish to invest in differ-
ent types of assets, including cash, fixed-income investments like 
bonds, and equities. Decide, too, what percentage of each asset 
class you wish to hold in different geographic locations, such as 
Canada, the U.S., and globally.
After you figure out what you want to hold, you can choose the 
best location for each type of investment. If you want to hold some 
fixed-income investments, you would generally want those inside 
your registered accounts (see Tips #42 and #43) or your Tax-Free 
Savings Account (see Tip #41) where that highly taxed interest 
income can be earned tax-sheltered. If you want to hold Canadian 
equities, those are great in a non-registered account so you can 
take advantage of the dividend tax credit. Depending on how much 
money you have to work with in each account, there will likely be 
some overlap as well. That’s okay. This is just a starting point.
 
Also consider the risk of each investment when choosing its loca-
tion. For example, say you want to buy one stock that is more 
“speculative” in nature. It could make you lots of money, or it 
could bust. You may want to buy that stock in your non-registered 
account. Why? If it does go bust, you would create a capital loss, 
which could be used to offset capital gains. If that stock goes bust 
in your registered account, the loss is useless to you.
Choose Tax-Smart Investments
It pays to pay attention to how your various forms of investment 
income are taxed — like all things in taxland, each scenario has its 
pros and cons. In this section we look at tax-effectively managing 
your income from dividends, capital gains, and interest.
Canadian dividends have 
their advantages
A dividend is a distribution of a corporation’s profits to its share-
holders after all expenses and income taxes have been paid. 
Investors receive dividends on the stocks they purchase in their 
investment portfolios. If you’re looking to generate dividend 
income, you want to invest in Canadian equities (either directly or 
via a mutual fund) that pay dividends annually.

 #34: Minimize Tax on Your Investment Income 165
Canadian dividends are a tax-efficient source of investment income 
because they qualify for a special dividend tax credit, which keeps 
the tax burden low. Canadian dividends are always taxed at a 
lower rate than interest income and are usually taxed at lower 
rates than capital gains. Dividends are only taxed at higher rates 
than capital gains in a few provinces at the higher tax brackets 
(we’re talking $80,000 plus of taxable income).
 
Dividends from public corporations resident in Canada — which 
is what you would normally hold in an investment portfolio — are 
called eligible dividends, and these must be included in your tax-
able income and grossed up by 45 percent (that is, multiplied by 
1.45, or 145 percent). So, if you receive $10,000 in eligible divi-
dends this year you’ll have to include $14,500 in your income. The 
grossed-up dividend represents an estimate of what the dividend 
would have been had the corporation not been subject to tax.
Now for the good stuff. A dividend tax credit exists that’s designed 
to reflect the tax paid by the corporation. Put another way, you as a 
shareholder receive a tax credit for the tax the corporation paid on 
your behalf. The federal dividend tax credit is 13.33 percent of the 
grossed-up non-eligible dividend, and 19 percent of the grossed-up 
eligible dividend paid. (Don’t you just love all the math?)
Say Tom receives a $10,000 eligible dividend from IM Canadian 
Corporation, a publicly listed Canadian corporation he holds in his 
non-registered investment account. Assume Tom has a high tax-
able income and therefore will pay federal tax of 29 percent on the 
dividend. Further, assume Tom is subject to a provincial tax rate 
of 14 percent, and a provincial dividend tax credit 6.5 percent of 
the eligible dividend (refer to Table 3-1). How is tax calculated on 
the dividend that Tom receives?
Table 3-1  
Taxation of Eligible Dividends

dividend)

As you can see, the net result of this calculation is that Tom pays 
about 25 percent tax on the eligible dividend from IM Canadian 
Corporation. We consider this tax efficient because an equivalent 
amount of interest income Tom earned would garner tax of 43 
percent.
When you receive a T3 or T5 slip reporting your dividend income, 
you’ll notice that the slip has boxes that contain both the actual 
amount of dividends and the taxable amount of dividends paid. 
Be sure to include only the taxable amount of dividends on your 
tax return. The T3 or T5 slip will also note the federal dividend tax 
credit you are entitled to. (Phew!)
 
In some cases it is possible to pay no personal tax on eligible divi-
dends received because of the basic personal exemption and the 
dividend tax credit. In most provinces (but not all), you can earn 
about $49,000 of dividends without having to worry about any type 
of tax (assuming you don’t have any other income sources).
Capital gains are tax efficient
Capital gains are generated when you make a profit on the sale of 
an asset such as a stock or even a piece of land. See Tip 38 which 
is dedicated to helping you keep your capital gains tax as low as 
possible. Capital gains are a very tax-efficient source of investment 
income because they’re taxable only when realized (that is, when 
your shares are sold or, when you invest in mutual funds, when the 
securities in the mutual fund are sold). Further, capital gains are 
just one-half taxable. This makes the tax bill on a realized capital 
gain exactly one-half of the tax bill on interest income.

 #34: Minimize Tax on Your Investment Income 167
Capital gains are calculated by taking the sales proceeds less the 
tax cost (usually the purchase price) of an investment and less 
any selling costs. You pay tax on only half of any remaining gain. If 
you’re looking for potential capital gains outside of your registered 
account, Canadian or foreign equities or mutual funds with stock 
exposure are your best bet.
 
Capital gains are not always taxed more efficiently than dividends —
 it depends on your tax bracket (Tip #2), province/territory of resi-
dence, other sources of income, and the type of dividend. Even at 
the highest tax brackets the tax bill is very similar for capital gains 
and dividends, making them both very tax-efficient investment 
returns. The good news is that Canadian stocks might pay divi-
dends and earn you capital gains, so a Canadian stock investment 
is generally very tax friendly (Tip #35).
 
Assuming you have no other sources of income, you can earn a 
pretty hefty amount of eligible dividends and pay no tax because of 
your basic personal amount and the dividend tax credit. Of course 
the actual amount differs by province. You’re looking at close to 
$50,000 of tax-free eligible dividends in many provinces, which 
includes the impact of the alternative minimum tax (see Tip #1).
Interest income can be costly
You’ve probably got the hint by now that interest income is not 
the most tax-friendly investment return. You’ll find interest income 
is always the least tax-efficient (read: taxed the most!), because it 
is fully taxed at your marginal tax rate. For example, if your mar-
ginal tax rate is 32 percent and you earn $1,000 of interest income, 
you will pay $320 of tax, meaning your after-tax return is $680. That 
doesn’t mean they shouldn’t play a role in your investment port-
folio; that depends on your risk tolerance and the purpose of the 
funds. We simply want to make you aware of the tax exposure.
 
Investments that earn interest income include term deposits, 
guaranteed investment certificates (GICs), Canada Savings Bonds, 
corporate and government bonds, and money market mutual funds.

Pay Less Tax on Your 
Stock Investments
S
o many investment choices are available that you might be 
confused about where to invest. But when it comes to tax ben-
efits, Canadian stocks rule the roost. When you purchase the stock 
of a company, you become a shareholder; a part owner of that com-
pany. As a shareholder you’re entitled to dividends declared by 
the company (although not all companies pay dividends). You also 
benefit when the company’s share price goes up, because you can 
choose to sell the shares for more than your purchase price. Both 
Canadian dividends and capital gains are considered tax efficient 
because the tax rates on these types of returns are about half of 
what you would pay on interest income.
Understanding the Tax Differences 
between Public and Private 
Company Shares
Not all stock investments are created equal. You can make many 
different types of stock investments, which we cover in this section.
Simply stated, when you invest in a public company share, you’re 
one of many shareholders (thousands, maybe). As the shareholder 
of a private company, you’re likely one of very few shareholders, 
and may even be the sole shareholder. Public company shares 
are very easy to purchase. You do so through a stock exchange 
and would usually use an investment advisor or an online trading 
account to make your purchases. 
A private company share would not be available on a stock 
exchange. Instead you would set up your own corporation, or pur-
chase shares of an existing corporation by way of a private deal. 
You might do the negotiations on your own, or use a lawyer or 
accountant to help with the purchase. 

 #35: Pay Less Tax on Your Stock Investments 169
Public company shares
The most common type of stock issued here in Canada is common 
shares of public companies. This would include shares of the large 
Canadian banks, insurance companies, and oil and gas companies, 
among many others. When you’re a common shareholder you’re 
entitled to dividends when they are declared by the company. Not 
all companies pay dividends, so if you’re looking for dividends as 
a source of income do some research. If a company has a strong 
history of paying dividends in the past, it will generally continue to 
pay dividends into the future. 
Public companies also issue preferred shares. Preferred shares 
have set dividend rates attached to them and these are paid in 
preference to the common shareholders. 
From a tax standpoint, dividends from Canadian common or pre-
ferred public company shares are the same. These dividends are 
eligible for the dividend tax credit, which greatly decreases the tax 
burden as opposed to interest income. You can generally expect 
to pay about half the amount of tax, if you’re taxed at the highest 
marginal rates, with Canadian dividends versus interest income. 
We talk about the tax advantages of dividends in Tip #34.
Private company shares
Investing in shares of private Canadian companies will produce the 
same tax benefits as public companies. The dividends you receive 
are eligible for a dividend tax credit, although it’s not always quite 
as generous as the credit for public company shares. However, 
if the company is considered a qualified small business corpora-
tion (QSBC; see Tips #30 and #31), upon sale you can earn up to 
$750,000 of capital gains tax free. This capital gains exemption is 
not available on private company shares.
Foreign shares
Although you may choose to purchase foreign shares to diversify 
your investment portfolio, keep in mind that any dividends paid on 
the foreign shares are not eligible for the dividend tax credit. This 
means that the dividends are essentially taxed like regular income 
such as interest income or a salary.
Any dividends received should be fully included in your taxable 
income, after being converted to Canadian dollars. If you paid tax 
to a foreign jurisdiction on those dividends, you can claim a foreign 
tax credit for all or a portion of the tax. See Tip #36 for the full 
details.

Part III: Tips for Investors  
170

Receiving Stock Dividends
A stock dividend is a dividend that a corporation pays to its share-
holders by issuing new shares instead of cash.
 
The rules for a stock dividend mirror those for a cash dividend. The 
only difference, of course, is that you owe tax, but you have not 
received any cash to pay the tax! The corporation paying the stock 
dividend will issue you a T5 slip showing the amount of dividend 
to report on your tax return. The value or amount of the stock divi-
dend in dollars will be determined by the corporation’s board of 
directors. If the corporation is a Canadian resident, the gross-up and 
dividend tax credit rules we discuss in Tip #34 will apply.
 
Be aware that a stock dividend and a stock split are not the same 
thing. A stock split is simply dividing your shares into more shares 
with no change to the corporation’s share capital. You’ll owe no 
tax on stock splits, but you can rack up substantial tax on stock 
dividends if the board of directors places a high value on the stock 
issued via the stock dividend.
Transferring Dividend Income 
from Your Spouse
Say your spouse/common-law partner receives dividends from a 
Canadian resident corporation but has income, and a resulting tax 
liability, that is too low to make full use of the dividend tax credit. 
If this is the case, the dividend tax credit may go partially or fully 
unused — a tax credit being wasted! (A dividend tax credit in 
excess of a tax liability does not result in a tax refund.)
To avoid “wasting” part or all of the dividend tax credit, the spouse 
with the lower income can transfer the dividends to the higher-
income spouse to claim on his or her own tax return. When trans-
ferred, the dividends will be grossed up and the dividend tax credit 
can be claimed.
 
Why in the world would you want to do this? At first glance, you’d 
think it would result in more tax, because the higher-income 
spouse is paying tax at a higher rate. But by transferring income 
out of the lower-income spouse’s hands, you may be increasing 
the spousal credit amount the higher-income spouse can claim. 
The increase in the credit, together with the fact that the higher-
income spouse can use the full dividend tax credit, will more than 
offset the higher tax rate paid. If it doesn’t, then you simply do not 
make the transfer!

 #35: Pay Less Tax on Your Stock Investments 171
This transfer has a few restrictions:
 
✓ Only dividends received by your spouse or common-law part-
ner can be transferred. Dividends received by other depen-
dants are not eligible.
 
✓ Only dividends received from taxable Canadian corporations 
(that is, dividends eligible for the 45- or 25-percent gross-up) 
may be transferred. Foreign dividends do not qualify.
 
✓ All the spouse’s eligible dividends must be transferred. Partial 
transfers are not allowed.
 
✓ This transfer is allowable only if it creates or increases the 
spousal credit amount you’re entitled to.
 
If you’re 65 or older, transferring your spouse’s dividends to your 
return could reduce your age credit if it brings your net income 
above the current threshold (about $35,000). Moreover, if it 
increases your income above about $65,000, you’ll find you’re sub-
ject to the Old Age Security (OAS) clawback (Tip #64). The thresh-
olds for the age credit and OAS clawback change annually.
Handling Shares in a Company 
That’s Been Bought Out
Rarely a week goes by without news that a company is being bought 
out by another company, or a spinoff of a portion of a company is 
taking place. And when you’re a shareholder of that company, it 
usually means tax implications.
As a general rule, if you’re receiving only shares as part of the 
transaction, and no cash, there are no tax implications. Instead, 
the adjusted cost base of your original shareholding will carry 
through to the new shares you will own. In the case of a spinoff 
you would prorate your adjusted cost base between two shares 
you now hold. Keep in mind that if you do receive any cash pro-
ceeds, that cash is taxable.
 
If the spinoff relates to a foreign corporation, you might receive a 
tax slip treating the spinoff as a taxable dividend. If certain condi-
tions are met, you’re able to elect to exclude that dividend from 
your income.
 
Companies can treat buyouts and spinoffs in many ways. Contact 
the investor relations department of the company or consult its 
Web site for details on how to treat the transactions on your tax 
return. Most companies offer investors very detailed instructions 
on how to file their taxes.

Know the Rules on Foreign 
Investments
A
s a Canadian resident, your entire worldwide income is tax-
able. So if you make foreign investments, you must report 
your investment income on your Canadian tax return. Some special 
rules apply (of course!), so read on.
Knowing When Foreign Investment 
Income Is Taxable in Canada 
If you earn foreign investment income, it’s taxable in Canada. 
Remember to convert the income to Canadian dollars before 
reporting it on your tax return.
Some common types of investments and the kinds of returns you 
might earn are shown in Table 3-2:

The Bank of Canada has some handy currency conversion calculators 
on its Web site. Check them out at www.bankofcanada.ca/en/
rates/exchange.html. The CRA also posts exchange rates on 
its Web site each year.
 
When you’re calculating the gain or loss from the sale of a foreign 
investment, convert the purchase price of the investment using 
the exchange rate in place at the time the purchase was made. The 
sales price is converted using the rate in place at the time of sale. 
Any gain from the currency conversion is still taxable; however, 
the first $200 of exchange gains are not taxable. Likewise, the first 
$200 of currency losses is not deductible.
Foreign dividends are not treated the same as dividends received 
from Canadian resident corporations. Here are the details:
 
✓ Foreign dividends are not subject to the dividend gross-up 
and dividend tax credit calculations. This means that foreign 
dividends are taxed the same as interest income.
 
✓ Foreign dividends are included in income at their full 
amount. Even if the originating country withheld tax on the 
dividend, the full amount — not the dividend minus the tax 
withheld — is included in income.
 
✓ All foreign dividends are included in calculating your tax-
able income. Even if the dividend you received is not taxable 
in the country of origin, it’s still taxable here!

What to Do If You Also Paid 
Tax to Another Country
If you’ve received income from foreign sources this year, you may 
already have paid tax to foreign tax authorities. But as we mention 
at the beginning of this tip, Canadians are taxed on their world-
wide income, which means that this same income is being taxed in 
Canada. Does this mean you’re being double taxed? Probably not. 
Luckily for you, Canada lets you claim a tax credit for the foreign 
taxes you’ve paid.
 
Claiming the foreign tax credit can take a bit of work. First, two types 
of foreign tax credits exist, one for foreign tax paid on non-business 
income, perhaps better known as “investment income,” and one for 
foreign tax paid on business income. Second, you need to do a sepa-
rate calculation for each country you paid the foreign tax to.
 
If you paid a total of $200 or less in foreign non-business taxes, 
you do not need to do a separate calculation for each country. 
Generally, the foreign tax credit you can claim for each country is 
the lowest of either the foreign income tax you actually paid to the 
foreign country, or the Canadian federal tax due on your income 
from that country.
For example, say you earned foreign income and paid $5,000 of 
foreign tax on that income. Then, say that same income would give 
rise to $3,000 of Canadian tax. In this situation, you’d be allowed 
to claim only a $3,000 foreign tax credit. Think of it this way: If that 
income were your only taxable Canadian income in the year, letting 
you claim a tax credit of $5,000 would actually entitle you to a tax 
refund in Canada. Why would Canada reimburse you for taxes 
you paid to another government? The foreign tax credit system is 
designed to help you avoid paying double tax on the same income, 
but not to reimburse you for earning income in a higher-taxed 
jurisdiction.
Use form T2209, “Federal Foreign Tax Credits,” to calculate the 
amount of your foreign tax credit. After you’ve calculated the 
amount of foreign tax credits you’re entitled to, enter the total in 
box 14 of schedule 1.
 
If you paid tax on income from foreign investments (that is, foreign 
non-business income), your foreign tax credit cannot be more 
than 15 percent of your income from that investment. However, 
you may be able to deduct the excess amount on your return at 
line 232.

 #36: Know the Rules on Foreign Investments 175
 
You can carry unclaimed foreign business income taxes back three 
years and forward ten years.
 
If your federal foreign tax credit on non-business income is less 
than the tax you paid to a foreign country, you may be able to claim 
a provincial or territorial foreign tax credit. Complete form T2036, 
“Provincial Foreign Tax Credit,” to determine the amount, if any, of 
the credit available.
Here’s how to claim the federal foreign tax credit. First, ensure 
you complete the federal foreign tax credit area on schedule 1 and 
attach form T2209 to your return. Also attach the following:
 
✓ A note showing your calculations. (Remember: Show all 
amounts in Canadian dollars.)
 
✓ Proof, such as an official receipt, showing the foreign taxes 
you paid. For example, if you paid taxes in the U.S., attach 
your W-2 information slip, U.S. 1040 tax return, and any other 
supporting documents. Foreign taxes paid may also be noted 
on your T3 and T5 slips.
Reviewing the Rules on Foreign 
Property Holdings
On page 2 of your tax return, you’re asked if the total cost of all 
foreign property you owned in the year was greater than $100,000. 
If so, you need to answer yes and complete form T1135, “Foreign 
Income Verification Statement,” and file it with your tax return. 
The types of property that are considered foreign property 
include:
 
✓ Funds in foreign bank accounts
 
✓ Shares of foreign companies
 
✓ Land and buildings, such as a rental property, located outside 
Canada
 
✓ Mutual funds organized in a foreign jurisdiction
 
✓ Non-Canadian government and corporate bonds

Part III: Tips for Investors  
176
Foreign property does not include:
 
✓ Property used exclusively in an active business
 
✓ Vacation properties (must be used primarily as a personal 
residence, not rental)
 
✓ An interest in a U.S. Individual Retirement Account (IRA)
You’ll have to convert the cost of your foreign properties into 
Canadian dollars to see whether it’s more than $100,000. To do 
this, you need to find out the foreign exchange rate at the time you 
purchased the asset.
Take a look at some examples. Suppose Karen owns shares of a 
U.S. corporation with a tax cost of $85,000. She also holds $20,000 
in a U.S. bank account. Karen has to file form T1135, because 
although the cost of each property is less than $100,000, the com-
bined value of all her foreign properties exceeds the $100,000 
threshold.
What about Dave? He holds $120,000 of foreign stocks in his RRSP. 
Does he have to file form T1135? No. You don’t have to file this 
form for assets held in your RRSP.
Note that you can still EFILE your tax return, but form T1135 needs 
to be mailed off separately to the CRA.
 
Form T1135 must be filed if the tax cost of a foreign property 
exceeded $100,000 at any time during the year, not just at the end 
of the year.
 
Substantial penalties exist for failing to file form T1135 by April 
30. And these penalties increase when the CRA asks you to file a 
return and you don’t comply, or if you’re found to have given false 
information.

Consider Tax-Advantaged 
Investments
Your goal as an investor is to receive the highest return possi-
ble for the amount of risk you can stomach. But you can’t just 
look at the simple returns of each investment to determine how 
much money you made. To truly distinguish between investment 
returns, you need to look at the after-tax returns. When looking for 
tax savings, consider some investments available in Canada that 
offer unique tax benefits. 
Don’t get us wrong; we’re not necessarily recommending these 
investments. Choosing them is something you should do after 
research and perhaps working with an investment professional. 
But understanding these tax benefits is one step toward determin-
ing whether these are right for you.
Recognizing the Pros and Cons 
of Labour-Sponsored Funds
A labour-sponsored venture capital corporation (LSVCC), other-
wise known as a labour-sponsored fund, is a venture capital mutual 
fund established under specific federal or provincial legislation 
and managed by labour unions or employee groups. 
The tax benefit of a LSVCC is in the tax credits. The allowable fed-
eral credit is 15 percent of the cost, to a maximum of $750. A $5,000 
investment will garner you the full allowable credit. Many prov-
inces also offer credits as well. 
 
If you redeem your fund within eight years, the tax credit you 
claimed will be clawed back. Make sure this is an investment 
you’re comfortable with for the long term.
 
You can contribute labour-sponsored funds to your RRSP. If you 
choose to do so, don’t forget to claim an RRSP deduction as well as 
the federal (and perhaps provincial) tax credit for your investment!

Part III: Tips for Investors  
178
178
 
If the first registered holder of the labour-sponsored fund units is 
a spousal RRSP, either the RRSP contributor or the RRSP annuitant 
(the spouse) may claim the credit for the investment. (We talk 
more about spousal RRSPs in Tip #50.)
Attach to your return either a T5006 slip, “Statement of Registered 
Labour-Sponsored Venture Capital Corporation Class A Shares,” 
or an official provincial/territorial slip documenting your invest-
ment. If the labour-sponsored funds went into your RRSP, you must 
attach an official RRSP receipt to your return as well.
Saving Tax with Flow-Through 
Shares
When you purchase a flow-through share, you’re investing in a 
Canadian company in the exploration or mining sector. This type 
of investment is most appropriate for taxpayers taxed at the high-
est rates because of the sizable deductions and credits available. 
However, because you normally would want to make a pretty big 
investment in order to really benefit from the tax savings, make 
sure you don’t overdo it from an investment standpoint. Keep the 
flow-through investment only a portion of your overall portfolio. 
The rules of diversification still apply! And remember that the 
shares may not be liquid — if you need some cash back, you may 
not be able to get to it easily.
The government allows special tax breaks for investors in the natu-
ral resource sector in order to help fund the huge expenditures 
these companies have to make in the early days of their explora-
tion, before any profits can be made. These companies have a lot 
of deductions, though, and are allowed to give those deductions 
to their investors. It’s not uncommon for investors to receive a tax 
deduction for the full value of their investment in the first year or 
two after the investment was made.
Tax benefits from flow-through shares include:
 
✓ Tax deduction for 100% of eligible exploration expenditures
 
✓ A 15% non-refundable tax credit for certain investments
 
✓ Provincial tax credits in many provinces
 
The tax cost of flow-through shares is considered nil, so whenever 
you decide to sell them you’ll have a guaranteed capital gain. Flow-
through shares, therefore, manage to reduce current taxes and to 
defer taxes until the future when the shares are sold.

 #37: Consider Tax-Advantaged Investments 179
 
Flow-through shares may benefit you when you have unused capi-
tal losses, because you’ll have a high chance of generating a capital 
gain in the future.
Choosing a Tax-Efficient 
Mutual Fund
Mutual funds are pools of assets managed by professionals. The 
assets managed range from real estate to mortgages to stocks 
and bonds. As the mutual fund earns income, or sells some of its 
underlying assets, income and capital gains may be generated. 
These income and gains, net of fund expenses, are distributed to 
the fund’s investors.
If you invest in mutual funds, you’ll find that most income dis-
tributed to you retains its identity in your hands. This means 
that income earned as capital gains or Canadian dividends by 
the fund is still regarded as capital gains or Canadian dividends 
to you. Investors can take advantage of the low rate on Canadian 
dividends due to the dividend tax credit and pay tax on only 50 
percent of capital gains, just like they could if they owned the 
underlying assets directly.
 
Highly taxed interest income retains its identity only when you 
purchase a mutual fund trust and you receive a T3 slip. If you own 
a mutual fund corporation investment (and if you receive a T5 slip, 
you do), you’ll notice that you never get an interest distribution — it’s 
just not possible (trust us on this one). If you’re looking to buy a 
bond fund, a money market fund, or a balanced fund where a large 
percentage of the underlying holdings are interest-bearing invest-
ments like bonds, consider a “corporate class” mutual fund to 
minimize tax on your investment returns. 
Corporate class mutual funds are also beneficial where you like to 
make regular changes to your portfolio. Each fund has a variety of 
underlying pools of investments that you can choose from. If you 
have a gain from the pool you’re currently invested in, and switch to 
another pool within the same umbrella fund, you won’t pay tax on 
your gains. This means that tax is deferred until you sell out of the 
fund altogether. With a traditional mutual fund trust, any transfers 
between funds will give rise to a disposition for tax purposes (which 
means you’ll have to pay tax on your gains on your next tax return).
 
Very often, funds automatically reinvest distributions to the fund-
holders in new units of the fund. In these situations, although you 
never see any of the cash, you’ll be taxed on the income distrib-
uted. This is why you may have received a tax slip this year even 

Part III: Tips for Investors  
180
though you didn’t see any cash coming into your account. Be sure 
to keep track of the reinvestments, because they will increase your 
adjusted cost base and can help minimize capital gains when you 
eventually redeem your mutual fund units.
Buyer Beware: Tax Shelters
Your income is high and you hate paying tax. You want a magical 
solution to manage your taxes. You’ve taken advantage of all the 
deductions and credits you can think of. Now what? Well, some 
Canadians turn to investment tax shelters, such as limited partner-
ships (see Tip #29) and flow-through shares (see above).
Although some legitimate and effective tax shelters do exist, not 
all are created equal. You must weigh the benefit of the tax deduc-
tion to the actual merit of the investment itself. Given the large 
investment most tax shelters require, you may want to have your 
accountant take a look at the details.
Watch out for these traps with investment tax shelters:
 
✓ The adjusted cost base on your investment is deemed to be 
nil, therefore you’re deferring tax only until the investment is 
sold; at that time a capital gain will arise (although that capi-
tal gain is taxed at a lower rate than the deduction originally 
benefited from).
 
✓ They can be hard to sell in the short term after the tax deduc-
tions have been taken. Be sure you don’t need liquidity!
 
✓ You can be hit with alternative minimum tax (see Tip #1) if 
you take too many deductions.
 
✓ They may require you to make future instalment payments 
(see Tip #14), so you must ensure you have ongoing liquidity.
 
The CRA has not been impressed by many tax shelters and tracks 
them quite closely. Be assured that if the CRA is offended by any 
of the activities of the tax shelter (even if it has an identification 
number), tax benefits will be disallowed. Buyer beware — each 
year new schemes arise, and CRA is on the lookout. If it seems too 
good to be true, it usually is. (For more on the CRA’s stance on 
charity tax shelters, see Tip #11.)

Minimize Tax on 
Capital Gains
A
 capital property is any asset you own — real estate, shares 
of public and private corporations, bonds, units of mutual 
funds, cars, boats, jewellery, art, and so on. When you sell a capital 
property, you can end up with a gain or loss on the sale (well, you 
could also break even). The gain or loss is referred to as a capital 
gain or a capital loss. This chapter deals with tips for capital gains. 
We discuss capital losses in Tip #39.
What Is a Capital Gain?
To see whether you have a capital gain on the sale of a capital 
property, you need to know the following three amounts:
 
✓ The proceeds of disposition — total funds received and/or to 
be received from the sale of the capital property
 
✓ The adjusted cost base of the capital property — often referred 
to as simply the “ACB” or “tax cost” of the capital property
 
✓ The costs incurred in selling the capital property, for example 
legal fees and commissions — referred to as selling costs or 
outlays and expenses
You have a gain when the proceeds of disposition are greater 
than the adjusted cost base of the capital property plus the costs 
incurred in selling the capital property. 
 
Depreciable property is a special kind of capital property. The 
cost of depreciable property can be written off for tax purposes 
over a number of years by claiming annual capital cost allowance 
(CCA, or, in other words, “tax depreciation”) amounts. Common 
examples of depreciable property are rental buildings (but not the 
land, which is not considered to depreciate) and capital assets 
used to earn income from a business, such as buildings used in a 
business, machinery, computer equipment, or office furniture and 
equipment. In addition to incurring a capital gain, you may also be 
required to add a recapture of prior-year CCA deductions to your 
income. See Tip #44 for more details.

Part III: Tips for Investors  
182

Calculating Your Taxable 
Capital Gain
Only 50 percent of the capital gain is taxable. The amount of the 
capital gain subject to tax is referred to as the taxable capital gain.
Say that Lynne sold 1,000 shares of Public Corporation Limited for 
$7,500. She received the full proceeds at the time of the sale and 
paid a selling commission to her investment advisor of $80. The 
adjusted cost base of the shares is $3,500 (equal to the original 
purchase price of the shares plus her buying commission). Lynne 
calculates her capital gain — and taxable capital gain — as follows:
Proceeds of disposition
$7,500
Less: Adjusted cost base
($3,500)
Less: Outlays and expenses
($80)
Capital gain
$3,920
Because only 50 percent of the capital gain is taxable, Lynne 
reports $1,960 ($3,920 × 50 percent) as her taxable capital gain on 
line 127 of her tax return.
Contrasting Capital Property 
and Income Property
The judgment on whether a property is capital or income depends 
on both the nature of the property and the manner in which the 
owner manages the property. If the owner intends to realize a 
profit from the property (for example, a speculator in real estate) 
versus holding the property for the income it produces (for exam-
ple, a landlord of a rental property), the gain or loss realized on 
the sale is treated as ordinary income or loss (which is fully tax-
able/deductible) as opposed to a capital gain or loss (which is only 
50 percent taxable/deductible).
 
In an ideal situation, you would treat your gains as capital and your 
losses as income. The reason for this is twofold: one, capital gains 
are only 50 percent taxable, but business income is fully taxable; 
and two, capital losses can be applied only against capital gains, 
but a business loss can be applied against any source of income to 
reduce tax. For the average stock and mutual fund investor, doing 
this will be difficult. However, if you’re planning to sell other types 
of capital property, it’s something to think about.

 #38: Minimize Tax on Capital Gains 183
To understand the difference between capital and income in rela-
tion to the taxpayer’s intention, think about the scenario of a tree 
and its fruit. If you bought the tree with the intention of selling the 
fruit, then any subsequent sale of the tree would be on account of 
capital. If, however, you purchased the tree intending to sell it and 
make a quick buck, then you would treat the proceeds of the sale 
as income — and 100 percent of any gain would be taxable.
In deciding whether the gain or loss is on account of income or 
capital, tax courts have used the following tests:
 
✓ Period of ownership: If property has been held for only a 
short period, it may be considered to have been purchased 
to be resold, and, therefore, the profits may be treated as 
income. A property held for a longer period is more likely to 
be treated as capital.
 
✓ Improvement and development: Where systematic efforts 
are made to make properties more marketable, it may indicate 
a business of selling properties rather than holding properties 
as investments.
 
✓ Relationship of the transaction to the taxpayer’s ordinary 
business: The more similar the transaction is to the tax-
payer’s ordinary business, the more likely it is that the trans-
action will be treated as income (for example, the sale of a 
renovated home by a general contractor).
 
✓ Reasons for and nature of sale: If the sale of a property is the 
result of an active campaign to sell it as opposed to the result 
of something unanticipated at the time of purchase, the prof-
its may be considered on account of income.
 
✓ Frequency of similar transactions: A history of buying and 
selling similar properties, or of quick turnovers, may indicate 
the taxpayer is carrying on a business.
Even if your transaction does not satisfy one of these tests, that 
does not mean the transaction will automatically be considered 
capital or income. The courts look at the larger picture, and you 
may have the opportunity to argue either way. 
Knowing When to Claim 
Your Capital Gain
A capital gain is realized and taxable when you sell a capital prop-
erty. Prior to the time you actually sell the property, the gain is 
unrealized, and therefore not taxable. However, there may be 

Part III: Tips for Investors  
184
184
times when you haven’t actually sold the asset or received any 
proceeds, but you have triggered a capital gain because you have a 
deemed disposition.
Understanding deemed dispositions
What does “deemed” mean? In certain situations, the tax rules con-
sider you to have sold or disposed of something when in the true 
economic sense you have not. A capital gain can be triggered along 
with a tax liability on the accrued gain. This can be quite harsh in 
terms of cash flow — remember, it’s only a disposition for tax pur-
poses. It doesn’t mean you’ve received any cash, which you could 
use to pay your tax bill.
A deemed disposition occurs when you die. At that time you’re 
considered to have sold everything you own for proceeds of dis-
position equal to the market value at the time of death — so any 
accrued gains are subject to tax. (An exception to this rule is when 
assets are bequeathed to a spouse.) Also, when you cease to be a 
resident of Canada, you’re again considered to have disposed of 
everything you own (with a few exceptions), and tax would be pay-
able on any accrued gains. Both dying and leaving Canada can be 
expensive in terms of taxes!
Some other situations in which you are deemed to have disposed 
of a capital property include when:
 
✓ You exchange one property for another.
 
✓ You give or donate property (other than cash).
 
✓ You transfer property to a trust — exceptions to this include 
transfers to an alter-ego (set up by an individual acting on 
his or her own) and joint spousal/partner trusts (set up by a 
couple in partnership). (For more on alter-ego and joint/spou-
sal partner trusts, see Tip #73.)
 
✓ Your property is expropriated, stolen, or destroyed.
 
✓ An option that you hold to buy or sell property expires.
 
✓ You change all or part of a property’s use (for example, you 
change your residence to a rental property, or vice versa).
 
You may think that just because you haven’t received any pro-
ceeds from a sale, you have no capital gain (or loss) to report. 
A common example occurs when you give property to a family 
member. The problem is that for tax purposes you’re deemed to 
have received proceeds equal to the market value of the property 
at the time of the gift. It doesn’t matter how much cash — if any — 
actually changed hands.

 #38: Minimize Tax on Capital Gains 185
Many individuals think they can sell a property, such as a cottage, 
to a friend or family member for $1 so no capital gain is incurred. 
Well, the selling individual may receive only $1, but for tax pur-
poses he or she is considered to have received proceeds equal to 
the market value of the property at the time of the sale. It doesn’t 
pay to be nice when it comes to the tax rules!
Understanding how units of a mutual 
fund can cause capital gains
If you own units of a mutual fund, capital gains can arise for you in 
two ways:
 
✓ When you sell your shares or units of the mutual fund, a capital 
gain (or loss) will result from the difference between your 
proceeds of disposition and the adjusted cost base of the 
investment. 
 
✓ Capital gains realized by the mutual fund from its investment 
portfolio are usually “flowed out” to you as distributions. 
Expect to receive information slips from your investment 
dealer (a T3 or T5 slip) detailing the amounts to be reported.
Timing Sales to Minimize Tax
Because a capital gain is triggered upon a sale or deemed disposi-
tion, you generally have some control over the timing of the sale, 
and therefore your tax bill.
Consider triggering capital gains periodically in your open invest-
ment accounts, especially in years when your income is particu-
larly low. Taxpayers with no other sources of income (such as 
minors, for whom you may have set up “in trust for” investment 
accounts) can trigger about $20,000 in capital gains (only $10,000, 
or 50 percent, is taxable) and not attract any tax. This is because 
each taxpayer has a basic personal tax credit worth about $10,000 
to reduce taxes payable (actual amount increases annually). The 
advantage to this strategy is seen in the future when you actually 
sell the investment for good.
By triggering gains in years when you have low income, you 
manage to increase the tax cost of the investment. For example, 
say you have an investment with a current value of $10,000 and a 
purchase price, or tax cost, of $4,000. If you choose to trigger the 
capital gain on the investment this year, you will have a $3,000 
taxable gain ($10,000 less $4,000 × 50 percent) to report on your 
tax return. Assuming you have no other sources of income, you’ll 

Part III: Tips for Investors  
186
186
face no tax on that gain. However, you’ve managed to increase the 
tax cost of the investment to $10,000. If you sell the investment for 
$12,000 next year, you’ll be subject to tax on only 50 percent of 
that increase in value, or $1,000.
Maximizing Your Adjusted 
Cost Base 
The adjusted cost base (ACB) is a very important figure when cal-
culating your capital gain, because the higher your adjusted cost 
base the lower your capital gain — and therefore your tax bill. You 
want to make sure you include everything you can in the adjusted 
cost base to keep your taxes to a minimum.
The adjusted cost base of a property is usually the purchase price 
of the property plus any expenses incurred to acquire it, such as 
real estate commissions and legal fees. However, in many situations 
figuring out the adjusted cost base is a little more complicated. We 
give some examples here:
 
✓ If you make improvements to a property, such as a major 
overhaul of your family cottage, the cost of these improve-
ments will increase the property’s adjusted cost base.
 
✓ If you inherit property, or perhaps receive property as a gift, 
your adjusted cost base of the property will be the market 
value of that property on the day you took ownership of it 
(although special rules apply if you inherited the property 
from your spouse).
 
✓ If you’re a newcomer to Canada, your adjusted cost base is 
the market value (not your purchase price) of your property 
on the day you became a Canadian resident for tax purposes.
 
✓ If you reinvest distributions — such as dividends in a dividend 
reinvestment program (DRIP), or mutual funds allocations 
where you received additional units rather than cash — these 
reinvestments increase your adjusted cost base. Think of it 
as receiving the cash and then using the cash to purchase 
additional shares or mutual fund units. The amount of your 
investment has increased, so your adjusted cost base should 
increase as well!
 
✓ If you elected to crystallize — or lock in — a capital gain back 
in 1994 to use your lifetime capital gains exemption, your 
adjusted cost base will be higher than the purchase price of 
the property. We discuss the 1994 capital gains election in the 
section “Lifetime Capital Gains Exemption” near the end of 
this tip.

 #38: Minimize Tax on Capital Gains 187
Identical properties
You may have “identical properties” when over time you’ve pur-
chased shares of the same class of a corporation or units of the 
same mutual fund. To determine the adjusted cost base of identi-
cal properties sold, you have to calculate the average cost of each 
property in the group at the time just prior to a sale taking place. 
You determine the average cost by dividing the total cost of identi-
cal properties purchased by the total number of identical proper-
ties owned (that is, the number of shares or mutual fund units).
Partial dispositions of 
capital property
When you sell only part of a property, you have to divide the 
adjusted cost base of the property between the part you sell and 
the part you keep.
Graeme owns 100 hectares of vacant land with an adjusted cost base 
of $100,000. He decides to sell 25 hectares of this land. Because 25
is 1⁄4 of 100, Graeme calculates 1⁄4 of the total ACB as follows:
Total ACB 
$100,000
The ACB of the part sold 
($100,000 × 1⁄4) =
$ 25,000
Graeme’s adjusted cost base for the 25 hectares he sold is $25,000. 
The adjusted cost base of the remaining hectares is $75,000.
Using Selling Costs to Minimize 
Your Taxable Gains
You’re allowed to deduct the costs incurred in selling a property 
(referred to as “outlays and expenses”) in calculating a capital 
gain. These costs will cause a capital gain to be lower and a capital 
loss to be greater.
Common selling costs include fixing-up expenses, finders’ fees, 
commissions, brokerage fees, surveying fees, legal fees, transfer 
costs borne by the seller, and advertising costs.

Investigating the Capital 
Gains Reserve
When you sell a capital property, you usually receive full payment 
at that time. However, sometimes you receive the amount over 
a number of years. For example, you may sell a capital property 
for $50,000, receiving $10,000 when you sell it and the remaining 
$40,000 over the next four years. When this happens, you can claim 
a reserve, which allows you to shift or differ reporting a portion 
of the capital gain to a later year (or years). In other words, if you 
have not received the full selling price for your capital property 
in the year of sale, you don’t need to pay all the tax on the capital 
gain right away! The reserve works as a deduction against the capi-
tal gain being reported.
To claim a reserve, you still calculate your capital gain for the year 
as the proceeds of disposition minus the adjusted cost base and 
the outlays and expenses involved in selling the property. From 
this amount, you deduct the amount of your reserve for the year 
to arrive at the amount of capital gains that will be subject to tax 
in the current year. What you end up with is the part of the capital 
gain that you have to report in the year of disposition. This is the 
part of the capital gain that will be taxed in the year.
 
The amount of reserve you can take in any particular year is the 
lesser of the following:
(Proceeds still to be paid/Total proceeds) × Gain
1⁄5 of the gain × (4 – # of preceding taxation years ending 
after disposition)
Did you catch all that? Let’s take Finlay, for example. Finlay sold 
capital property this year for $200,000. However, he received only 
$20,000 upfront. The remaining $180,000 is not due until next year. 
The adjusted cost base of the property was $150,000. The total 
gain from the sale of the property is $50,000 ($200,000 proceeds 
less cost base of $150,000). However, because Finlay did not 
receive all the proceeds this year, he is eligible to claim a reserve.
This year, the year of sale, his reserve is the lesser of the following:
($180,000/$200,000) × $50,000 = $45,000
(1⁄5 × $50,000) × (4 – 0) = $40,000
Therefore, this year he can shelter a portion of the $50,000 gain 
with a $40,000 reserve. He will report only $10,000 of the gain.

 #38: Minimize Tax on Capital Gains 189
Next year, he must include in his income the $40,000 reserve he 
claimed in the year of sale. Next year’s reserve is the lesser of the 
following:
0/$200,000 × $50,000 = 0
(1⁄5 × $50,000) × (4 – 1) = $30,000
Therefore, next year Finlay cannot claim any reserve and must 
include in his income the remaining $40,000 of the capital gain. 
This makes sense because he received all the proceeds by the end 
of the year, so no further reserve should be permitted.
To deduct a reserve in any year, you have to complete form T2017, 
“Summary of Reserves on Dispositions of Capital Property.” The 
information provided on the back of the form explains the limits 
on the number of years for which you can claim a reserve, and 
the amount of the reserve you can deduct. The calculations work 
such that you report the full capital gain by the end of the fourth 
year after the year you dispose of the capital property. Therefore, 
you pay the tax on the capital gain over a maximum period of five 
years, whether or not money is still owed to you after the five-year 
period. Tip: With respect to the sale of certain farm property, the 
reserve can be extended to 10 years where the purchaser is your 
child, grandchild, or great-grandchild.
Checking Out the Lifetime 
Capital Gains Exemption
Prior to February 23, 1994, everyone had a $100,000 personal 
capital gains exemption. This meant that every Canadian could 
generate up to $100,000 of capital gains during their lifetime (up to 
this date) and not pay tax on those gains. As the saying goes, all 
good things must come to an end; therefore, in order to get a final 
benefit from this exemption, in 1994 many people elected to use up 
their exemption and trigger a capital gain (on form T664, “Capital 
Gains Election”).
If you used this election, you effectively sold capital property to 
yourself. The sale price chosen was usually a price between the 
adjusted cost base and the market value of the property — the 
idea was to trigger a capital gain that could be fully offset by the 
remaining amount of the $100,000 exemption. You were then 
considered to have repurchased the capital property at the same 
price, effectively increasing the adjusted cost base of the capital 
property so that when the property was actually sold, the capital 
gain would be that much less.

Part III: Tips for Investors  
190
 
When selling an asset, be sure to check back to your 1994 tax 
return to see whether you elected to trigger any gain on the capital 
property sold. If so, your adjusted cost base will be higher than 
you think it is — and your capital gain, and tax bill, lower! One of 
the most common mistakes we see in tax returns is that the “new” 
adjusted cost bases as a result of making the $100,000 capital gains 
election is not used in calculating the capital gain, because people 
have forgotten about the election. The original adjusted cost base is 
used, resulting in the capital gain and tax liability being overstated.

Make the Most of 
Capital Losses
W
e all hate to lose money on an investment — and, over 
time this is a reality many of us will face. However, you can 
use losses to reduce your current-year taxes and even to get back 
some of the tax you paid in prior years!
 
Keep in mind that the losses must be in a non-registered, or open, 
investment account. Losses in your RRSP or RRIF account are not 
deductible.
What Is a Capital Loss?
You have a capital loss when you sell, or are deemed to have sold, 
a capital property such as a stock, bond, mutual fund, or piece of 
real estate for less than its adjusted cost base and the selling costs.
As we discuss in Tip #38, only 50 percent of capital gains are tax-
able. In line with this rule, only 50 percent of capital losses are 
deductible; but there’s a catch: capital losses are deductible only 
against capital gains.
Offsetting Capital Gains 
with Capital Losses
Capital losses will benefit you for tax purposes only when you have 
capital gains to offset. Capital gains cannot be used against your 
other types of income.
In Tip #38 we give the example of Lynne, who incurred a capital 
gain of $3,920 on her sale of 1,000 shares of Public Corporation 
Limited. Let’s say she also sold 1,000 shares of Private Corporation 
Limited for $4,000 later in the same tax year. Her adjusted cost 
base of these shares was $5,000 and she paid selling commissions 
of $50. In other words, Lynne had both a capital gain and a capital 

Part III: Tips for Investors

loss this year. Lynne would calculate her total capital gains and 
taxable capital gains as follows:
Capital gain on sale of 1,000 shares of Public Corporation Limited 
$3,920
Capital loss on sale of 1,000 shares of Private Corporation Limited
Proceeds of disposition
$4,000
Less: Adjusted cost base
($5,000)
Less: Outlays and 
expenses
($ 50)
Capital loss
($1,050)
Net capital gains
$ 2,870
Lynne enters her taxable capital gains — 50 percent of the net of 
her capital gains and losses in the year — at the bottom of sched-
ule 3 and on line 127 of her tax return.
50 percent of $2,870 
$ 1,435
What if a taxpayer has 
only capital losses?
So, what happens when the only share sale Lynne had in the year 
was the sale of the 1,000 shares of Private Corporation Limited? 
She would report the $1,050 capital loss on schedule 3, and at the 
bottom of schedule 3 she would report a net capital loss of $525 
(50 percent of $1,050).
Can Lynne carry the loss to line 127 of her return so the loss is 
effectively deducted against her other sources of income (employ-
ment income, interest income, and so on) in calculating her tax-
able income? Would it not be logical that if 50 percent of capital 
gains are subject to tax, then 50 percent of capital losses should be 
deductible in computing taxable income? (We wish it would!)
Sadly, it doesn’t work that way. Lynne cannot carry the net capital 
loss of $525 to line 127 because line 127 is for taxable capital gains 
only. However, Lynne has other options. She can’t get any tax relief 
this year from the loss because she has no gains to offset the loss 
against. However, if she has reported taxable capital gains on her 
tax return in any or all of the prior three years, the net capital loss 
can be “carried back” to those years to be applied against the tax-
able capital gains she reported previously. Doing this will result in 

 #39: Make the Most of Capital Losses 193
a tax refund for the year or years to which Lynne has carried back 
the net capital loss.
Say Lynne reported taxable capital gains of $300 three years 
ago, $2,500 two years ago, and none last year. In filing her cur-
rent return, Lynne would include form T1A, “Request for Loss 
Carryback,” indicating she wanted $300 of her current net capital 
loss of $525 to be carried back or applied against the gains from 
three years ago, and the remaining $225 to be applied against the 
taxable capital gains from two years ago. The CRA will reassess 
Lynne’s prior-year returns and issue her a refund cheque for these 
years, as the loss application reduces the taxable capital gains that 
were subject to tax in those years.
 
You must use form T1A to request net capital loss carrybacks. 
Don’t file amended tax returns for the years in which the taxable 
capital gains were reported!
 
Losses can be carried back to a previous year only to the extent 
they cannot be used to reduce gains realized in the current year.
 
In most circumstances, request that net capital losses be carried 
back to the third previous year if you reported taxable capital 
gains in that year. This will be your last chance to recoup taxes 
paid on capital gains from that year, because losses can be carried 
back for only three years. 
What if a taxpayer has not reported 
taxable capital gains in 
the last three years?
Can Lynne get any tax relief from her current-year net capital loss 
if she has not reported any taxable capital gains in the last three 
years? Yes! Any net capital loss that cannot be carried back to a 
prior year can be carried forward to a subsequent year and be 
applied against taxable capital gains reported in those years. No 
time limit is placed on using the losses.
If Lynne doesn’t incur a taxable capital gain until a future year, she 
can apply the current net capital loss against the taxable capital 
gain reported in that year. It would be reported on line 253, “Net 
capital losses of other years,” on Lynne’s future return. The loss 
carryforward would not impact the schedule 3 filed with Lynne’s 
future or the amount she would report on that year’s line 127.

Watching Out for the 
Superficial Loss Rules
 
Sell your losing investments only if you no longer like them and do 
not wish to repurchase that same investment for at least 30 days 
after the sale. If you repurchase the same investment within 30 
days, your loss will be denied. For the techies out there, these are 
known as the “superficial loss rules.” If you want to purchase the 
investment back, wait for 31 days between settlement dates.
 
Consider selling your loss investment and then contributing the 
proceeds to your RRSP up to your contribution room limit. This 
will trigger the loss for tax purposes while also providing you 
with cash to put into your RRSP — for even more tax relief! Do not 
directly transfer the investment into your RRSP: a capital loss in 
this case is considered to be nil by the Income Tax Act. You also 
cannot repurchase that same investment you sold for a loss within 
your RRSP for at least 30 days. This is also a superficial loss, which 
means your loss will be . . . well . . . lost. Instead, choose a different 
investment altogether inside your registered account, or wait until 
your 30-day period is up.
Exploring the Special Rules 
in the Year of Death
Normally capital losses can be carried forward indefinitely to offset 
capital gains generated into the future. However, upon death no 
more tax returns will be filed for the deceased, meaning the capital 
losses may be permanently lost.
A special tax rule is in place to assist in this situation. If a taxpayer 
dies with unused net capital losses of earlier years, these losses 
can be deducted against any type of income, such as employment 
income, interest income, or pension income reported in the year of 
death as well as in the year preceding death. The amount deduct-
ible will be restricted if the taxpayer had ever claimed the capital 
gains exemption.

Use Insurance Products 
as Investments
L
ife insurance is commonly used to cover tax liabilities on 
death and to help provide a source of income for heirs. 
However, some products available through life insurance compa-
nies can help you manage your current tax bill as well.
Investing inside a Life 
Insurance Policy
If you purchase a “permanent” life insurance policy, such as a 
universal life policy, you can combine your insurance coverage 
with a side investment fund. From a tax standpoint, this side fund 
works very much like an RRSP in that the investments inside grow 
tax free and you won’t face a tax bill until the funds are withdrawn 
or the policy is surrendered (you don’t get a tax deduction for 
amounts put into the fund, though). Most universal life policies 
have a decent selection of investments to choose from, which 
means that the investment component of the policy has the poten-
tial to grow at a respectable rate of return.
 
Unlimited, tax-sheltered growth sounds too good to be true — and 
it is. Our tax law places a ceiling on the amount that can be in the 
investment account, and you’ll be charged penalties if you build up 
too much investment in your side fund. Your insurance company 
will work with you to ensure you stay onside.
This type of strategy isn’t for everyone. Because you’ll have to pay 
premiums for insurance, you must weigh these costs against the 
benefits of tax-free growth. However, if you already need insur-
ance, the investments are a nice add-on feature. Of course, this 
strategy is based on the presumption that you’re insurable.
 
Life insurance proceeds (including any investments held within the 
policy) received on the death of the insured are received tax free.

Create Tax-Efficient Income 
with Annuities
If you’re retired, or are approaching retirement, you may be con-
cerned about generating stable income from your non-registered 
investments. Many decide they want to play it safe and choose 
fixed-income products like GICs. One problem with a full fixed-
income portfolio is that the interest income is highly taxed at 
your marginal rate, which could be up to 50 percent of the income 
earned!
Enter annuities. Annuities are investment contracts you establish 
with a life insurance company. In return for an initial deposit, the 
contract will provide you with level and guaranteed payments for 
a certain time period, or for life. Part of the payment to you is tax-
able, but not all of it, which is why an annuity enhances your after-
tax cash flow.
 
It’s possible to purchase an annuity with registered funds. In that 
case, the entire annuity payment to you is taxable, just like any 
other payment out of the RRSP or RRIF.
The taxation of the annuity depends on the type of annuity you 
hold. In a non-registered account, you can have a prescribed or 
non-prescribed annuity. In either case, part of the payment to you 
is taxable as interest income, and part is considered a tax-free pay-
ment of your initial capital. With a prescribed annuity you’ll have a 
level taxable portion each year, which is great for planning for your 
tax bill. It can also allow for some deferral of taxes because the 
taxable portion in the earlier years is less than it would be under a 
non-prescribed annuity. With a non-prescribed annuity, you’ll have 
more taxable interest income in the early years, and very little in 
later years. Your insurance company will help determine the right 
taxable versus non-taxable portion.
Report the interest income earned from an annuity at line 121, 
unless you’re 65 years of age or older and receiving retirement 
income, in which case you report the interest at line 115, “Other 
pensions or superannuation.”
Let’s look at an example. Lou has $250,000 to invest. He’s looking 
at a fixed-income investment that will pay him 4.5 percent, but he 
is taxed at a 40 percent marginal tax rate. With that investment, he 
would earn $940 per month, but would net only $565 after tax. If 
Lou instead purchased a life annuity with his $250,000, his monthly 

 #40: Use Insurance Products as Investments 197
income would increase to $1,740 and his net after-tax income 
would increase to $1,620!
 
An annuity purchase is not reversible. You’re giving up your capi-
tal in return for the guaranteed income payments. Ensure you’re 
fully aware of the features of the annuity before you sign on the 
dotted line.
If you want to preserve your capital for your estate, you can pur-
chase an insured annuity that will add permanent life insurance 
coverage onto your contract. Let’s say Lou added this feature to 
his annuity. If $250,000 of insurance coverage was purchased with 
a cost of $551 per month, his net after-tax income would still be 
$1,070, almost double what it was with his original fixed-income 
investment, and his chosen beneficiaries would receive a $250,000 
payment on his death.
 
Your particular numbers will differ from those shown here 
depending on your age, insurability, and other factors.
Knowing When Segregated 
Funds Make Sense
Segregated funds are similar in many respects to mutual funds, 
where your investment dollars are pooled with those of other 
investors and managed by a fund manager. Segregated funds are 
offered by insurance companies, and therefore have added insur-
ance benefits not offered by traditional mutual funds.
The actual benefits you receive depend on the terms of your insur-
ance contract. At a minimum, the contract will offer you a guaran-
tee of at least 75 percent of your initial investment deposit at fund 
maturity or the death of the policy holder. Some guarantee up to 
100 percent. In addition, some segregated funds allow you to lock 
in investment increases and base the future guarantee on this reset 
value.
 
Segregated funds offer some non-tax benefits including creditor-
proofing in certain situations. This is often important for business 
owners or professionals who are afraid of being sued, and want to 
protect their savings in the case of a lawsuit. Another benefit is the 
ability to pass the assets outside of probate, which can save on 
probate fees on death in provinces where these fees are high. (For 
more on probate, see Tip #74.)

Part III: Tips for Investors  
198
From a tax standpoint segregated funds allocate income to investors 
each year, so you can expect to pay tax on dividends, capital gains, 
and interest. Segregated funds can also allocate out capital losses 
(mutual funds cannot), so investors will benefit from any losses real-
ized by the seg fund if the investor has capital gains to offset. The 
income is allocated on a time-weighted basis, so if you held the seg 
fund for only a portion of the year your income allocations will be 
prorated. Again, this is not available with a mutual fund.
Any top ups offered by the contract in the form of resets or guar-
antees are not taxable at the time they are given to the investor. 
Instead, they may be taxable only when the fund is sold, or on 
death. Consider Sue, who invested $10,000 in a seg fund that guar-
anteed 75 percent of the value upon maturity in 15 years. In 15 
years, the fund was worth only $5,000. The seg fund would top up 
her fund to $7,500 (75% of the initial investment of $10,000). If she 
continued to hold the fund, this top up would not be taxable at this 
time. It would be taxable when the fund is sold or on Sue’s death.
Upon sale or upon death, the difference between the proceeds of 
disposition and adjusted cost base of a seg fund is taxable as a 
capital gain.
 
If you dispose of your seg fund for proceeds equal to or less than 
the adjusted cost base plus selling costs, you’ll have no net tax bill, 
even if a maturity or death benefit was paid. This is because you 
did not receive proceeds of more than you invested.

Invest in a Tax-Free 
Savings Account
T
here’s a new type of investment account in town, and the name 
says it all. The Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) introduced in 
2009 allows Canadians aged 18 plus to save funds in a tax-friendly 
way. Its uses are many, and in our opinion all Canadians should 
have one where possible.
Discovering Why TFSAs 
Are So Tax Friendly
What’s so neat about the TFSA? Well, the tax-free part! After you 
set up a TFSA, you can make investments inside the account. You 
don’t get a tax deduction for the actual contribution into the TFSA 
(like you would for an RRSP), but the investments you purchase 
with the contribution can grow tax-free and any income earned on 
the investments, such as dividends and interest, is also tax free.
 
You’re able to contribute to a TFSA for your spouse without having 
to worry about attribution rules (which would normally tax invest-
ment earnings back to you). Because a TFSA is not taxable to start 
with, no attributable earnings exist. So, if you can, maximize con-
tributions to both your and your spouse’s TFSA annually.You can 
also fund a TFSA for an adult child without any tax worries.
Withdrawals from your TFSA are not subject to tax. This is much dif-
ferent from an RRSP, where the full withdrawal is taxed at your mar-
ginal tax rate. Therefore, TFSAs are very useful for those trying to 
manage a tax bill, such as high income earners, and seniors who are 
trying to avoid the OAS (Tip # 64) or age credit (Tip # 67) clawbacks.

Considering the Uses for a TFSA
Due to its flexibility, the TFSA has a variety of applications including:
 
✓ Short-term or emergency-type savings: Normally you would 
put these funds into a cash-like equivalent such as a money 
market fund or a high-interest savings account. A TFSA will 
shelter the highly taxed interest income from tax but will 
allow you easy access to the funds when needed.
 
✓ Retirement savings: RRSPs are highly taxed upon withdrawal, 
and non-registered investment account withdrawals may also 
give rise to tax if accrued gains exist in the account. It’s help-
ful to supplement the savings with a TFSA so that you have 
access to some tax-free income in retirement. Plus, because 
earnings can grow tax free, you don’t have to worry about tax 
draining your investment returns.
 
✓ Education savings: RESPs are a tax-efficient way to save for a 
child’s education (Tip #57); however, limits exist to what you 
can contribute, and if the child does not go to school penal-
ties may apply. If you’re looking to supplement your child’s 
education, you can save in a TFSA and withdraw the funds 
when your child goes to school.
 
✓ Estate planning: Wealthy individuals may have more invest-
ment savings than they will use during their lifetimes. On 
death, they may plan to leave their assets to family members 
or friends. Instead of paying tax on the investment income 
each year (some of which you might not even need), and 
potential tax and probate fees on death, you might wish to 
start giving away assets during your lifetime.
 
✓ The TFSA can be used twofold in this process:
 
• You can establish a TFSA for yourself, and depending on 
your province you can possibly name a beneficiary on 
the account, which makes this an efficient way to trans-
fer those assets later on.
 
• You might choose to set up TFSAs for your heirs now, 
and fully fund them each year. Perhaps tell them that 
you will continue to fund the TFSAs as long as they don’t 
make withdrawals out of the accounts! You’ve managed 
to pass assets on now, in a tax-efficient way.
 
A TFSA is a good location for any interest-bearing investments you 
would like to hold, particularly if you’re a highly taxed individual, 
because the tax rate on interest income is so much higher than the 
rate on dividends or capital gains.

 #41: Invest in a Tax-Free Savings Account 201
Adding Up the Contribution Limits
All Canadian residents age 18 or older are entitled to $5,000 of con-
tribution room in a TFSA each year. The contribution room is not 
income tested. If you don’t have the funds to make a contribution 
in a particular year, your room will carry forward. So, for example, 
if you didn’t use your $5,000 of room in 2009, you’ll have $10,000 of 
room to use in 2010. The room carries forward indefinitely. No age 
limit is placed on a TFSA.
The contribution room is set to increase annually to the rate of 
inflation and will increase in $500 increments.
 
In some provinces (currently Newfoundland and Labrador, New 
Brunswick, Nova Scotia, British Columbia, and the territories), the 
age of majority is 19. In those areas you cannot open a TFSA until 
you’re the age of majority. However, the contribution room accu-
mulates from age 18, so your overall ability to contribute to the 
TFSA doesn’t change, just your timing.
Withdrawals from a TFSA are not taxable, either. What’s more, if 
you make a withdrawal from your TFSA more room opens up. Say 
you contribute $5,000 to your TFSA in 2009 and in 2010 you want 
to remove some funds to go on a vacation. The account at that 
time contains $5,300; $5,000 of your initial contribution and $300 of 
growth. You can withdraw the whole $5,300 tax-free and open up 
another $5,300 of contribution room for future years!
Shopping Around for TFSAs
TFSAs can be set up at pretty much any bank, credit union, or finan-
cial services provider in Canada such as an investment dealer or life 
insurance company. Make sure the financial institution can offer you 
the types of investments you wish to hold in the TFSA. For example, 
a bank will be able to offer you investments such as mutual funds, 
GICs, money market funds, and the like; an investment dealer may 
be able to add in publicly traded stocks and bonds.
 
You can make the same types of investments in your TFSA as are 
allowed in your RRSP. However, you do have to make sure the 
financial institution you work with is licensed to sell the types of 
investments you want.

Part III: Tips for Investors  
202
 
It’s possible to establish more than one TFSA, but keep in mind 
that if you go over your contribution limit the CRA can charge 
penalties. 
Here are some questions to ask before determining where you 
want to set up your TFSA:
 
✓ What types of investments do you offer?
 
✓ What fees do you charge, such as account opening costs, 
transaction fees, monthly or annual maintenance fees, or any 
special product-related fees?
 
✓ Will I get investment advice, or do I make my own investment 
choices?
 
✓ What other services come with my TFSA, including financial 
planning help?

Invest in an RRSP
N
ext to the ability to sell your house tax free due to the prin-
cipal residence exemption, the RRSP is Canada’s best tax 
shelter. Many people believe a tax shelter is some very creative 
tax-planning idea available only to the wealthy. Not true! Almost 
every taxpayer who has a job or is self-employed can take advan-
tage of RRSPs. In this tip, we tell you how.
What Is an RRSP?
To easily understand what a registered retirement savings plan 
(RRSP) is, think of it as your own personal pension plan that has 
been CRA approved (“registered”).
An RRSP is an arrangement that allows you to save for your retire-
ment on a tax-friendly basis when you’ve earned certain types 
of income but haven’t necessarily been able to contribute to an 
employer’s pension plan. You control when contributions are 
made to your plan, the investments made in the plan, and when 
withdrawals are made (at least up until age 71).
Tax Savings Provided by RRSPs
The government wants you to save for your retirement. To encour-
age this, an RRSP offers two main tax advantages:
 
✓ A tax deduction for contributions made to an RRSP
 
✓ Tax-free growth while the funds remain in the RRSP
With an RRSP, no tax is payable until you make a withdrawal from 
your plan. You hope that the tax payable on RRSP withdrawals 
will be less than the tax saved when you took the deduction for 
making an RRSP contribution. This will occur if you’re in a lower 
tax bracket during your retirement years than the tax bracket you 
were in when you made your RRSP contributions.
 
A better idea is to have the withdrawal taxed in your spouse’s 
hands if he or she is in a lower tax bracket than you are at the 
time of the withdrawal. This is especially advantageous when you 

Part III: Tips for Investors  
204
204
already have significant retirement income (say, pension income 
from an RPP) and your spouse has little. We know this sounds too 
good to be true, but you can do it by making spousal RRSP contri-
butions. We discuss spousal RRSP contributions in this tip.
 
In addition to spousal RRSPs, seniors can take advantage of pension-
splitting legislation to pay less tax on certain RRSP withdrawals. 
You must be at least age 65 to use pension income splitting. Check 
out Tip #68 for the lowdown.
Setting Up an RRSP
You can set up an RRSP in many places: a bank, a trust company, 
through your investment planner, or online through a direct 
investing account. It’s as simple as filling out a form and handing 
over the money. After you contribute to the RRSP, you’ll be pro-
vided with an official RRSP receipt. This is what you’ll use to sup-
port the RRSP deduction you claim on your tax return.
 
Are you reading this after December 31? Don’t worry — it may not 
be too late to set up an RRSP and get a tax deduction for last year’s 
tax return! Contributions made to an RRSP within 60 days of the 
new year qualify for a tax deduction on your last year’s tax return. 
(Neat, eh?)
Determining How Much 
You Can Contribute
By now you might be convinced that an RRSP would be a great way 
to save for your retirement and to gain some tax benefits. So, why 
not sell the farm, so to speak, and put all your net worth into the 
RRSP? Well, slow down, Nelly. Not just anyone can set up an RRSP, 
and limits apply to how much you can contribute.
Generally, any person who has “earned income” in Canada can 
contribute to an RRSP. The amount that you’re allowed to contribute 
is based on a formula involving three numbers:
 
✓ 18 percent of your prior year’s “earned income,” to a dollar 
limit maximum set by the Department of Finance (the maximum 
for 2009 was $21,000)
 
✓ Less your pension adjustment, PA, if you’re a member of a 
registered pension plan
 
✓ Plus the pension adjustment reversal, PAR, which might occur 
if you’re a member of a registered pension plan

 #42: Invest in an RRSP 205
Understanding earned income 
and how it is calculated
The main consideration in determining your RRSP deduction limit 
is 18 percent of your prior year’s “earned income.” For purposes of 
determining your RRSP deduction limit, earned income consists of 
the following:
 
✓ Your salary, including taxable benefits (box 14 of your T4)
 
✓ Self-employed business income
 
✓ Rental income and royalty income
 
✓ Taxable spouse and child-support payments received
 
✓ Amounts from supplementary unemployment benefit plans
 
✓ Research grants
 
✓ CPP and QPP disability pension
To compute earned income, deduct the following:
 
✓ Union or professional dues deducted on your tax return 
(line 212)
 
✓ Employment expenses deducted on your tax return (line 229)
 
✓ Losses from self-employment 
 
✓ Losses from rental operations 
 
✓ Support payments deducted on your tax return (line 220)
Knowing the limit set by the 
Department of Finance
As we mention earlier, the maximum amount you can contribute to 
an RRSP in a given year is limited by earned income and amounts 
set by the government.
The maximum amount you may contribute to your RRSP will 
increase in future years (although you’re still limited to 18 percent 
of your earned income). The 2009 limit is $21,000. The limits are 
scheduled to rise as follows:
2010
$22,000
2011
Indexed to inflation

If you did not make your full RRSP contribution for any year from 
1991 on, this unused entitlement carries forward.
 
You can make RRSP contributions up to the end of the year you 
turn 71. Prior to 2007, you could make contributions only until the 
end of the year you turned 69.
Finding out your RRSP 
contribution limit
You can find out your RRSP contribution limit in four ways:
 
✓ Look at your Notice of Assessment. You receive this assess-
ment from the CRA after filing your return. Your current year’s 
RRSP contribution limit is highlighted on the assessment.
 
✓ Call the TIPS (Tax Information Phone Service) toll-free 
number (1-800-267-6999) and ask what your limit is.
 
✓ Calculate it yourself.
 
✓ Go to My Account on the CRA Web site (www.cra-arc.
gc.ca).
Exploring Your Investment 
Choices for an RRSP
An RRSP is not an investment in itself; the money you put into it 
must be used to purchase investments. The contribution you make 
to your RRSP is usually in cash. You can leave the RRSP in cash if 
you want, but you’ll get little to no future return on your money. 
Instead, it’s a good idea to invest the funds according to your risk 
tolerance, so you can maximize the eventual amount you’ll have to 
withdraw in retirement. Discuss your needs with the person you 
meet with to set up your RRSP.
For the most choice and flexibility in your RRSP investing, consider 
a “self-directed RRSP.” Don’t worry — “self-directed” doesn’t mean 
you’re on your own. You can work with your investment advisor 
to decide which investments are appropriate for your RRSP given 
your investment goals and risk-tolerance levels. For example, you 
may choose to hold a variety of mutual funds, stocks, bonds, other 
specialty investments, or even cash in your RRSP.

 #42: Invest in an RRSP 207
 
An annual cost to maintain a self-directed RRSP applies; to justify 
this cost, wait until your RRSP assets reach $20,000 before setting 
up this type of plan.
The following is a list of investments you may hold inside your RRSP:
 
✓ Cash, guaranteed investment certificates, term deposits, and 
Treasury bills
 
✓ Canada Savings Bonds, Canada RRSP bonds, and government 
bonds
 
✓ Publicly traded shares and bonds, warrants, options, and 
Canadian limited partnerships. You can hold Canadian or 
foreign investments without limit.
 
✓ Certain private-corporation shares, as long as you and your 
family own less than 10 percent
 
✓ Mutual funds, segregated funds, and labour-sponsored funds
 
✓ Certain mortgages, including a mortgage on your own home 
(although special rules apply)
 
✓ Investment-grade gold and silver bullion coins and bars (great 
news for all you pirates out there!)
 
If your RRSP holds an ineligible investment, it will be subject to a tax 
of 1 percent per month on the value of the ineligible investment.
RRSP Contributions in Kind
Wanna set up an RRSP or contribute to an existing RRSP, but find 
yourself short on funds? Well, provided you already own an invest-
ment that’s eligible for an RRSP (we provide a list above), why 
not contribute the investment itself to your RRSP? This is called 
a contribution in kind. But be careful. If you contribute an invest-
ment that has gone up in value from the time you acquired it, a 
capital gain will be triggered that will be taxed on your return. If 
the investment has gone down in value, you would think you would 
be entitled to a capital loss. No such luck. Why not? Because the 
taxman says so.
 
If you’re thinking about contributing investments that have 
declined in value, then sell the investment, claim the loss, and 
donate the cash. This way, you won’t lose out on claiming the capi-
tal loss. Don’t repurchase that same investment back in the RRSP, 
though — this will mean you still won’t be allowed to claim your 

Part III: Tips for Investors  
208
208
capital loss. Instead, use the cash to repurchase something similar 
(but not the identical investment) — or, if you’d prefer, something 
totally different — inside your RRSP.
Overcontributing to an RRSP
Generally, the amount you contribute to your RRSP will be equal 
to the RRSP deduction you take on line 208 of your return. However, 
the total amount you have contributed to your RRSP may exceed 
the amount you claim as a deduction when you do one of the 
following:
 
✓ You accidentally overcontribute to your RRSP: You’re per-
mitted to overcontribute to your RRSP. However, the overcon-
tribution is not tax deductible in the year it’s made. And if your 
overcontribution exceeds $2,000, you’ll find yourself in a penalty 
situation if you don’t withdraw the excess contribution. The pen-
alty is 1 percent per month of the overcontribution in excess of 
$2,000 — that amounts to 12 percent per year!
 
✓ Many people will overcontribute by exactly $2,000, because 
there is no penalty and the funds can earn income inside the 
RRSP tax free. Moreover, the $2,000 can be deducted on a sub-
sequent year’s tax return where you may not have 
contributed up to your maximum.
 
✓ A major undertaking by the tax authorities to review RRSP 
overcontributions is underway. So, even if your overcontribu-
tion has gone unnoticed in the past, this may not continue to 
be the case. We recommend you fix the problem now either 
by forgoing some future contributions (allowing you to deduct 
your overcontribution amounts) or by withdrawing the excess. 
You need to fill out special forms to ensure the withdrawal is 
not taxable, though.
 
✓ You don’t deduct some or all of the RRSP contribution you 
have made. Why would you not take a tax deduction when it’s 
available? Well, you may plan on being in a higher tax bracket 
in the future. Even though you make an RRSP contribution 
during the year, you don’t need to take the deduction that 
same year. You can save the deduction for a tax year when 
the deduction is more valuable. You don’t have to worry 
about those pesky penalties in this situation.

 #42: Invest in an RRSP 209
Making Special One-Time 
RRSP Contributions
Some special situations exist where you’re permitted to make addi-
tional RRSP contributions, or where you may choose to overcon-
tribute for future tax savings.
Receiving a retiring allowance
If you’re going to receive a severance or retiring allowance from 
an employer you worked for since before 1996, you may be able to 
put all or a portion of the payment directly into your RRSP. (Sorry, 
it can’t go into a spousal RRSP.) This is referred to as a “transfer,” 
and it’s attractive for two reasons:
 
✓ No income tax needs to be withheld on the portion of the 
payment being transferred directly into your RRSP. A direct 
transfer means the cheque goes from your employer to your 
RRSP — you don’t even get to touch the money!
 
✓ The portion transferred to your RRSP is in addition to your 
regular RRSP contribution limit. You can still contribute up to 
your RRSP contribution limit, in addition to the portion of the 
severance transferred to your RRSP.
 
It’s not critical that you roll your retiring allowance directly into 
your RRSP — this transfer can be made later. But be sure to make 
the contribution within 60 days following the end of the year in 
which you received your payment. If you don’t contribute before 
this time, the special contribution room is lost forever!
 
If any portion of your retiring allowance or severance cannot be 
transferred directly to your RRSP, consider using it to make a regu-
lar RRSP contribution (or a spousal contribution). In fact, you can 
ask your employer to directly transfer your ineligible retiring allow-
ance into your RRSP and no tax has to be taken off the payment.
Seniors overcontribution
The tax rules require you to wind up your RRSP by December 31 
in the year you turn 71. However, you might still work and have 
earned income and therefore RRSP contribution room that you 

Part III: Tips for Investors  
210
210
won’t be able to utilize. Instead of wasting contribution room that’s 
accumulated in years after the age of 71, an additional contribution 
can be made in the year you turn 71. The contribution should be 
made as late in the year as possible; December is best. 
Provided you’ve already maximized your RRSP contributions to 
date, an additional contribution will result in an overcontribution. 
The CRA charges a penalty of 1 percent per month on the over-
contribution in excess of $2,000. This means that an overcontribu-
tion of $21,000 made in December would attract a penalty of $190. 
(Calculated as $21,000 less the allowable contribution of $2,000 
times 1 percent.) Come January 1 of the year after you turn 71, 
you’ll be entitled to RRSP contribution room based on your earned 
income of the previous year. Therefore, your excess contribution 
will be used up, and the penalty stops accruing.
How will this benefit you? Well, assuming your marginal tax rate is 
45%, a contribution of $21,000 will save you $9,450 of tax, a saving 
well worth the $190 penalty. In addition, you’ll reap the benefits of 
tax-free compounding.
Using a Spousal RRSP for 
More Tax Savings
When you make your RRSP contribution, you have the option of 
putting the contribution in your own RRSP or in a spousal RRSP, 
or a combination thereof. A spousal RRSP is an RRSP to which 
you contribute the funds, although your spouse is the one who 
receives the funds when withdrawn. This means your spouse — 
not you — makes withdrawals from the plan and pays tax on those 
withdrawals.
Ideally, both you and your spouse should have equal incomes in 
retirement. Make a spousal contribution if your spouse will be in 
a lower tax bracket than you when the money is eventually with-
drawn. This way, you get the reduction at a high tax rate, and your 
spouse pays the tax at a lower one.
 
But beware: If your spouse makes a withdrawal from a spousal 
plan in the same year or within two calendar years of when you 
last made a spousal RRSP contribution, you — not your spouse — 
will be subject to the tax on the amount of the withdrawal that 
relates to contributions you made during this three-year period.

 #42: Invest in an RRSP 211
 
You’re not entitled to additional RRSP contribution room in order 
to make a spousal contribution. The total contributions to your 
own plan, plus your spouse’s, cannot be greater than your total 
RRSP contribution limit. (Your spouse’s contribution limit does not 
affect how much you can contribute to a spousal RRSP.)
 
Now that pension income splitting is allowed on RRSP withdraw-
als for those over age 65, you might wonder whether spousal 
RRSPs are obsolete. We say no! Where your spouse has little or no 
income, you can benefit from using both spousal RRSPs and pen-
sion income splitting. With a spousal RRSP, all the income from 
that plan can be taxed in your spouse’s hands. With pension split-
ting, a maximum of 50 percent of the withdrawals can be taxed to 
your spouse. Having a spousal RRSP therefore provides you with 
more income-splitting options for the long term.

Manage Your RRSP and 
RRIF Withdrawals 
A
s we discuss in Tip #42, registered retirement savings plans 
(RRSPs) are government-sanctioned plans that Canadians 
can use to save for their retirement. RRSPs are tax friendly because 
you get a tax deduction for contributions you make to the plan 
(within limits), and earnings within the plan grow free of tax — 
that is, until you make withdrawals. You can choose when you 
want to make withdrawals unless the plan is considered locked in. 
You might have guessed that at the point you make withdrawals 
you have income to report on your tax return.
A registered retirement income fund (RRIF) is created when you 
convert your RRSP — which must be done by the end of the year 
in which you turn 71 (although you could do it earlier). When your 
RRSP is converted to an RRIF, you’re required to make annual tax-
able withdrawals (withdrawals from an RRSP are optional). RRIF 
withdrawals, like RRSP withdrawals, are taxable.
Investigating How Your RRSP and 
RRIF Withdrawals Are Taxed
After you’ve placed funds in an RRSP, you’re generally able to with-
draw those funds whenever you want. However, we don’t normally 
recommend you make withdrawals prior to retirement. Because 
your RRSP assets are supposed to help fund your retirement, you’ll 
be taxed on the withdrawals. You may choose to withdraw funds 
on a tax-preferred basis, though, using the Home Buyers’ Plan or 
the Lifelong Learning Plan. We talk about these plans in this tip.
Withdrawals prior to RRSP maturity
Unless you’ve locked in funds, you’re allowed to withdraw funds 
from your RRSP whenever you want. However, the amount of the 
withdrawal is included in your income and is fully taxable, just like 
a salary or interest. This means the tax hit could be quite severe.

 #43: Manage Your RRSP and RRIF Withdrawals 213
In addition, these withdrawals will be subject to withholding tax 
at source. See Table 3-3 for the required withholdings. This means 
the financial institution where you hold your RRSP is obligated to 
take some tax off the payment being made to you, and then remit 
that tax to the CRA on your behalf. You’ll receive a T4RSP at tax time 
outlining the amount of taxable payment made to you, as well as the 
amount of tax withheld. Report the full RRSP withdrawal amount on 
line 129 of your tax return, and the withheld tax on line 437. 
Table 3-3 
Withholding Tax Amounts at Source
Withdrawal Amount

Quebec

$0–$5,000
10%
21%
$5,001–$15,000
20%
26%
$15,000 and over
30%
31%
 
In many cases the amount of withholding tax will not be enough 
to cover your actual tax liability when you file your tax return, so 
you’ll want to make sure you keep enough money on hand to pay 
your tax bill in April. For example, say you live in British Columbia 
and you expect your total income for the year to be $40,000. You 
want to take $5,000 out of your RRSP this year to go on a vacation 
to Mexico (not that we recommend a withdrawal for this purpose!). 
You can expect to pay about 30 percent tax on this withdrawal, or 
about $1,500. If only 10 percent of tax ($500) was withheld for taxes 
when the withdrawal was made (which is the required amount 
in all provinces but Quebec), you’ll have to come up with just 
over $1,000 when you file your tax return next year. Something to 
ponder over your margarita.
Withdrawals from spousal RRSPs
A spousal RRSP is an RRSP that you’ve contributed to but that 
names your spouse as the “annuitant.” This means that all retire-
ment funds out of this RRSP will belong to your spouse and not to 
you, the contributor (although you do get the upfront tax deduc-
tion). A spousal RRSP is usually used by individuals who have 
much higher incomes than their spouses and wish to “split” their 
retirement income rather than have the entire amount included in 
their income. 
A withdrawal from a spousal RRSP has very special rules that seek 
to dissuade individuals from placing money in a spousal RRSP and 
then withdrawing it soon after, to take advantage of the spouse’s 

Part III: Tips for Investors  
214
214
lower marginal tax rate. If these rules are violated, the income will 
be attributed back to the contributing spouse, which means it will 
be added to his or her income and taxed at that person’s marginal 
tax rate instead. This would be the same outcome had that person 
contributed to his or her own RRSP and then withdrawn the funds.
If your spouse withdraws money from a spousal RRSP that you’ve 
contributed to in the year or in the previous two years, the with-
drawal will be taxed in your hands and must be included on line 
129 of your return. It does not matter if your spouse’s name is on 
the T-slip! For example, if your spouse withdraws money from 
a spousal RRSP in 2010 that you contributed to in 2010, 2009, or 
2008, the withdrawal will be included in your income, not your 
spouse’s.
 
If the contributor is separated from his or her spouse, or was 
deceased at the time funds were withdrawn, the government will 
not attribute the income back to the contributor.
 
Contribute to a spousal RRSP at the end of the year (instead of on 
January 1) to reduce the waiting time on withdrawals from three 
years to just over two.
Withdrawals of unused contributions 
or overcontributions to an RRSP
Sometimes taxpayers are a little overzealous when it comes to 
contributing to their RRSPs. However (as you can imagine), we’re 
not allowed to put unlimited amounts into our retirement savings 
plans. When you put more than you’re allowed into your RRSP, you 
are said to have overcontributed. 
Other taxpayers contribute within the allowable limits, but decide 
for one reason or another not to deduct the contribution on their 
tax return. This is referred to as having an undeducted contribution.
 
It may make sense to create an undeducted contribution when you 
find yourself in an unusually low tax bracket. If you save the RRSP 
deduction for a year when your marginal tax bracket is higher, 
your tax deduction will be worth more. To do this, you still include 
the contribution on the RRSP deduction workchart (line C), but 
then simply choose to not claim the deduction this year (line D). 
This will result in the calculation of an undeducted contribution 
on line G of the workchart. By including the contribution on this 
year’s tax return, you ensure the CRA knows the contribution was 
made, and avoid problems in future years when you actually want 
to claim the deduction.

 #43: Manage Your RRSP and RRIF Withdrawals 215
 
Generally, any withdrawals of contributions to your RRSP, even 
those that exceed your contribution limit, are reported on line 129 
and taxed as income. This is the case even when you withdraw 
any undeducted contributions to the RRSP! Luckily, relieving pro-
visions exist that allow you an offsetting deduction against these 
income inclusions. (After all, you didn’t get a deduction for the 
contribution, so why should you pay tax on the withdrawal?)
Time limits exist, however. Specifically, you must withdraw the 
overcontribution in the year the contribution was made or in the 
following year, or in the year an assessment is issued for the year 
the contribution was made or for the following year. For example, 
if you made the overcontribution in 2010, you have to take it out 
of your RRSP in 2010 or 2011 to be entitled to the offsetting deduc-
tion. If your 2010 tax return is assessed in 2011 (as it probably will 
be), you then have the added option of removing the overcontribu-
tion by the end of 2012 to take advantage of the tax relief. These 
tight timeframes make it very important to remove the overcontri-
bution from your RRSP as soon as you find out about it. If you wait 
too long, you’ll be taxed on the withdrawal or will face penalties 
for the overcontribution. Neither is a very positive outcome.
 
If you’re going to withdraw your RRSP overcontribution, use form 
T3012A, “Tax Reduction Waiver on the Refund of Your Undeducted 
RRSP Contribution.” When you submit this form to the CRA, it will 
direct your financial institution not to withhold tax on the with-
drawal of funds. If you withdraw funds without form T3012A, the 
issuer of the plan will withhold tax. In this case, use form T746, 
“Calculating Your Deduction for Refund of Undeducted RRSP 
Contributions,” to calculate the amount of your tax deduction 
given that you have already paid withholding tax.
Withdrawals after age 71
An RRSP matures on December 31 of the year you reach 71 years 
of age. At this time, the government requires you to convert your 
RRSP to a registered retirement income fund (RRIF) or an annuity. 
You can also choose to convert early if you wish to earn a retire-
ment income.
Withdrawing from your RRIF
 
The transfer of the assets in your RRSP to your RRIF can take place 
without triggering any current tax. You simply need to contact 
the financial institution where your RRSP is held, or your financial 
advisor, to request your RRSP be converted to an RRIF. They will 
take care of the required paperwork.

Part III: Tips for Investors  
216
216
Like the RRSP, the RRIF earns income, tax free, inside the plan. An 
RRIF is different from an RRSP, however, in that you can no longer 
contribute to the plan, and you must make a minimum income 
withdrawal from the plan each year following the year in which 
the RRIF was established. The minimum withdrawals can be paid 
monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, or annually. All RRIF withdraw-
als are considered taxable income.
 
You’re allowed to withdraw as much as you want from your RRIF 
each year (unless it’s locked in), but you must take at least a mini-
mum payment. The minimum payments are legislated and are 
based on your age and the RRIF value at the end of the previous 
year. For example, the year after you turn 71 you must take at least 
7.38 percent of the value. The year after you turn 90 you have to 
take at least 13.62 percent of the value.
Conversion from an RRSP to an RRIF (or annuity) must take place 
when you reach age 71 — however, you might choose to do this 
conversion early. Some reasons to do so include:
 
✓ You need the income.
 
✓ You are at least 65 and want to take advantage of the pension 
credit on the first $2,000 of pension income or pension income 
splitting (Tip #68).
 
✓ You are currently in a low tax bracket and expect to pay very 
little tax on your withdrawals.
Of course, if you can afford to, it generally makes sense to keep the 
funds in your RRSP/RRIF for as long as possible in order to defer 
the tax hit on withdrawal.
 
Minimum required withdrawals from an RRIF are not subject to 
withholding tax, except in Quebec. However, if you withdraw more 
than the minimum amount, these withdrawals will be subject to 
withholding tax.
 
You don’t have to make any withdrawals from your RRIF in the 
year you set up the plan. In fact, you can (and should, if you’re 
financially able) defer making a withdrawal until December of the 
year after your RRIF is set up in order to defer tax for as long as 
possible.
Using an annuity
Instead of converting to an RRIF, you can also use your RRSP funds 
to purchase a life annuity to convert your savings to a source of 
income. A life annuity is a contract with an insurance company. 
The insurance company will promise you a set income for life, in 
exchange for a lump sum payment.

 #43: Manage Your RRSP and RRIF Withdrawals 217
 
The amount of payment you will receive from your annuity 
depends on factors such as your age, sex, health, current interest 
rates, and special features you choose to attach to your contract 
such as inflation protection, guarantee periods, and joint and sur-
vivor payments.
An annuity is beneficial when you prefer to know exactly what 
your income will be each year and have a need for income for life. 
The drawback is that if the markets do well, you won’t benefit like 
you might with an RRIF because the payments are not based on 
the market value of the plan assets each year. In addition, an annu-
ity purchase is irrevocable. After you purchase the contract you 
no longer own the assets; rather, you own a right to the income. 
You’re not able to access any payments other than your con-
tracted income amount. If you die early on in the contract, your 
survivors could be left with nothing, although that can be rectified 
by purchasing an annuity with a guarantee period so that at least 
some amount of payment can be made to a beneficiary if you die 
prematurely.
 
Ask lots of questions and give lots of information when you’re pur-
chasing an annuity. If you have a spouse you want to ensure the 
spouse will continue to get annuity payments after you’re gone. 
This is known as a joint and survivor annuity. You can also choose 
to purchase an annuity that’s indexed to inflation.
 
Income paid to you out of an annuity contract that originally came 
from registered funds is fully taxable to you just like payments 
out of an RRSP or RRIF. They are not subject to withholding tax. 
Annuities can also be purchased using cash or non-registered 
funds. These annuities are subject to different tax rules. See Tip 
#40 for more on annuities. 
Minimizing Tax on Your 
Withdrawals
Withdraw money from an RRSP only when you really need the 
income, so you can defer the resulting tax for as long as possible. 
And if you do have to make a withdrawal, try to use some of these 
strategies to keep the tax bill to a minimum.
Withdraw in low-income years
Try to withdraw amounts during a year in which you anticipate 
having a lower income. This will reduce the tax bite when the 
amounts are eventually included in income.

Part III: Tips for Investors  
218
218
Further, if you’re married, remove money from the RRSP of the 
lower-income earner first. This will reduce the tax paid by the 
family, because the lower-income earner probably has a lower mar-
ginal tax rate and will pay less tax on the withdrawal.
Use the pension credit
If you’re 65 years of age or older, report your minimum required 
RRIF withdrawal at line 115. Why? As we discuss in Tip #67, income 
reported at line 115 is eligible for the $2,000 pension credit at line 314. 
 
If you’ve taken advantage of pension splitting (Tip #68), you and 
your spouse could each benefit from the $2,000 pension credit. 
Each spouse wanting to claim the credit must be age 65.
 
If you’re age 65 or over but do not have sufficient pension income 
to qualify for the full credit (that is, your pension income is less 
than $2,000), you can create pension income by converting all or 
part of your RRSP to an RRIF or life annuity.
Take advantage of pension 
income splitting
As you accumulate more funds in your RRSP, you might find your 
tax rate in retirement increasing because the payments you’ll be 
required to withdraw from the account will push you into a higher 
tax bracket. 
If you have a spouse who is taxed at a lower tax rate than you, take 
advantage of the pension income splitting rules in order to shift 
some income, and tax, to your spouse’s tax return. The result will 
be less tax for the family as a whole. In fact, if you have few other 
sources of income, it may be to your advantage to convert your 
RSP to an RRIF or life annuity at age 65 so that you can tax advan-
tage of pension income splitting (and the pension credit!). See Tip 
#68 for the full details on pension splitting. 
Base withdrawals on the age 
of the younger spouse
If your spouse is younger than you, consider basing your minimum 
withdrawals on your spouse’s age to defer the tax hit from your 
RRIF for as long as possible.

 #43: Manage Your RRSP and RRIF Withdrawals 219
Why does this work? As we discussed earlier, after you have an 
RRIF you’re required to withdraw at least a minimum amount of 
income each year. The actual percentage withdrawal increases 
with your age. If your spouse is younger, the percentage of with-
drawal will be less. This will reduce the amount you’re required 
to withdraw each year, allowing you to defer tax and leave more 
assets in your RRIF for future growth. 
Split withdrawals over two tax years
By taking funds out at the end of December one year and in 
January the next year, you’ll be splitting the withdrawal over two 
tax years, thus reducing the tax hit in any one year. In addition, 
tax will not be payable on the January withdrawal until April 30 
of the following year — so, if you withdraw money from an RRSP 
in January 2010, additional tax will not be payable on this amount 
until April 30, 2011.
 
In the past, it was recommended to take registered fund withdraw-
als in increments of $5,000 or less to keep the tax withholdings 
to a minimum. The CRA has spoken out on this practice and now 
requires financial institutions to take higher future withholdings 
when you take out several smaller lump sum amounts that in total 
put you into a higher withholding bracket.
Use your RRSP for a home purchase
Although the general rule is that withdrawals from your RRSP are 
taxable, in some special circumstances the government allows you 
to withdraw funds with no tax. The first situation occurs when you 
withdraw money from your RRSP to purchase a home under the 
Home Buyers’ Plan. If you qualify, you’re allowed to withdraw up 
to $25,000 from your RRSP under this plan and not pay tax on the 
withdrawal.
Of course, your tax obligations aren’t over yet. You’re required 
to repay the amount you withdrew for your Home Buyers’ Plan to 
your RRSP. And if you don’t? You guessed it — the shortfall will be 
added to your income at line 129. See Tip #55 for further details.
Use your RRSP to go to school
As is the case with the Home Buyers’ Plan, you can withdraw funds 
from your RRSP on a tax-free basis to help you go back to school. 
This program is called the Lifelong Learning Plan.

Part III: Tips for Investors  
220
If you don’t pay back funds withdrawn under the Lifelong Learning 
Plan according to the required schedule, they are included in your 
income at line 129 every year that the payment is missed. Also, 
if you withdraw the money but do not use it for education, and if 
you do not return the funds to the RRSP by the end of the calendar 
year following your withdrawal from the educational institution, 
the entire amount will be included in income. For more on the 
Lifelong Learning Plan, see Tip #56.
Special Rules for Locked-in 
Retirement Accounts
Different withdrawal rules exist where you have a locked-in RRSP. 
A locked-in RRSP or locked-in retirement account (LIRA) is created 
when you transfer funds from a registered pension plan to an RRSP. 
When you have a regular RRSP, you can withdraw funds whenever 
you want if you’re willing to pay tax on the withdrawal (although 
it’s not always recommended). However, you’re not always 
allowed to make withdrawals at will if the funds are locked in. 
Withdrawals from locked-in plans are legislated in each province 
and may be limited. Even when you convert the locked-in RRSP 
to a source of retirement income you might find you have both a 
minimum and maximum withdrawal to consider. 
 
Registered pension plans are legislated federally or provincially. 
After you transfer pension funds to your own retirement account, 
you’re governed by that same federal or provincial legislation — 
which will affect your withdrawal options. 
You must convert your locked-in RRSP or LIRA to a source of income 
by the end of the year you turn 71. When you convert the plan to a 
source of income, you generally have the following options:
 
✓ Purchase a life annuity like you could with a regular RRSP.
 
✓ Transfer the funds to a life income fund. A LIF is almost identi-
cal to an RRIF except that annual maximum withdrawals and 
age limits apply in some provinces.
Some provinces offer additional options as well. Your financial 
advisor or financial institution will be able to help you with your 
options.

Manage the Tax on 
Property Investments
W
hen you purchase property investments, such as a rental 
property, you might earn various types of returns that give 
rise to tax. You might earn income from renting out the space, or 
gains on the sale of the property. In any case, the good news is that 
lots of deductions are available. In this tip we let you in on rules 
that can help you minimize your tax bill.
Real Estate Rentals — What’s 
Deductible, What’s Not
Rental income is earned from renting out properties such as a 
building, a house, a room in a house, an apartment, office space, 
machinery, equipment, vehicles, and so on. Most types of rental 
income are considered to be “income from property” and therefore 
are reported on line 126, although if you rent out properties as a 
business, you report it as self-employment income.
On the line for rental income on your tax return you’ll see a line 
for gross income (line 160) and a line for net income (line 126). 
Gross income is the full amount of rental income you received in 
the year, before taking into account expenses you incurred to earn 
that income. Net income is the amount left over after expenses.
 
Rental income is always reported on a calendar-year basis — that 
is, January to December. If you co-own a rental property, your 
share of the rental income or loss will be based on your percent-
age of ownership. Arbitrary allocations are not acceptable.
If you’re renting out real estate, you likely incur a variety of costs 
in order to earn that income. You can deduct many of these costs 
for tax purposes. You will need to keep track of your deductible 
expenditures during the year and then list them on form T776 
when you file your tax return. Take a good look at this form, 
because it will also help you remember all the types of expenses 
you might be able to claim. Note: You don’t have to send in your 

Part III: Tips for Investors  
222
222
receipts for rental expenses when you file your tax return, but 
keep them on file in case the CRA asks to see them.
The most common expenses incurred that may be deducted 
against rental income include the following:
 
✓ Mortgage interest
 
✓ Property tax
 
✓ Insurance
 
✓ Maintenance and repairs
 
✓ Heat, hydro, water
 
✓ Accounting fees
 
✓ Condo fees
 
✓ Landscaping
 
✓ Office supplies
 
✓ Fees paid to find tenants
 
✓ Advertising
 
✓ Management and administration fees
 
✓ Salaries or wages paid to take care of property
 
✓ Legal fees to collect rent or prepare rental documents
 
✓ Lease cancellation fees (amortized over the remaining term of 
lease to a maximum of 40 years)
 
✓ Mortgage application, appraisal, processing, and insurance 
fees (deducted over five years)
 
✓ Mortgage guarantee fees (deducted over five years)
 
✓ Mortgage broker and finder fees (deducted over five years)
 
✓ Legal fees related to mortgage financing (deducted over 
five years)
 
Real estate rentals can create losses for tax purposes. These losses 
can be used to offset other types of income you report on your tax 
return, thereby reducing your overall tax payable in the year — 
see Tip #39 for more on dealing with capital losses.
 
Costs you cannot deduct include mortgage principal, any penalties 
or interest assessed by the CRA, the value of your own labour, and 
other personal expenses relating to the property.

 #44: Manage the Tax on Property Investments 223
 
If you own one rental property in addition to your principal resi-
dence, you can deduct motor vehicle or travel expenses to con-
duct repairs and maintenance or to transport tools and materials 
to the rental property provided the property is located in your 
general area of residence. If you own only one rental property (and 
no other residence), you cannot deduct travel expenses to collect 
rent; this is considered a personal expense. Also, you cannot deduct 
travel expenses for a property outside your area of residence.
If you own two or more rental properties, you can deduct all the 
above expenses plus travel to collect rents, supervise repairs, and 
generally manage the properties. Your rental properties have to 
be located in at least two different sites away from your principal 
residence.
 
Real estate commissions or legal fees paid in connection with the 
purchase or sale of the property are not deductible as incurred. 
Instead, they must be added to the cost base of the property.
Sussing Out the Special Rules 
for Undeveloped Land
The tax treatment of undeveloped land is a tricky issue. If you 
rent out this undeveloped land (or even if you don’t!), you need to 
ensure you do not run afoul of the rules.
Deductibility of interest 
and property taxes
If you rent out vacant land, you’ll be allowed to deduct any interest 
and property tax only to the extent of the net rental income earned 
on the land (that is, income after other expenses are deducted). 
In other words, you cannot use the interest and property tax to 
create a loss on vacant land not used to produce income.
If, on the other hand, the land is used or held to carry on a busi-
ness, or if the land is held primarily for the purpose of gaining or 
producing income, the interest and property tax can be deducted 
in excess of earned income. This distinction allows land under 
buildings and land used in a business (for example, a parking lot) 
to avoid the interest and property tax restrictions.

Part II: Tips for Employees and Business Owners  
224
Capital assets
 
If the vacant land is considered a capital asset (it normally would 
be if you purchased it to hold as a long-term investment), the non-
deductible interest and property tax will be added to the cost of 
the land. This will reduce the capital gain (or increase the capital 
loss) on sale when the land is eventually disposed of.
Renting Out Your Personal Space
When renting out a residence that you also use personally, you 
have to determine which expenses relate solely to the rental activ-
ity and which ones are shared with the whole house:
 
✓ Expenses of rental activity: Expenses such as advertising, 
cleaning, and cutting keys are incremental costs of owning 
and renting the property. These expenses are 100-percent 
deductible against rental income.
 
✓ Expenses shared with the rest of the house: Expenses such 
as taxes, insurance, water, hydro, heat, maintenance, and 
mortgage interest would have been incurred even if a portion 
of the house were not rented out. These expenses are allocated 
between the rental and the rest of the house. This is because 
your personal portions of expenses are not deductible.
The CRA accepts two ways of allocating expenses:
 
✓ Based on the number of rooms in the house: If the house has 
ten rooms and two are rented, allocate 2⁄10 of the household 
expenses to the rental units.
 
✓ Based on the square footage: If the house is 2,000 square feet 
and the rental is 400 square feet, allocate 400⁄2,000 of the house 
expenses to the rental portion.
 
As tempting as it might be, do not claim capital cost allowance 
(CCA) when renting out part of your home. The reason? When you 
claim CCA against your rental income, the part of your home that 
is rented stops being your principal residence. This means that 
when you sell your home, part of your proceeds will be taxable 
because they’re no longer exempt under the principal residence 
exemption. (We touch on CCA more at the end of this tip and in 
Tip #32.)

 #44: Manage the Tax on Property Investments 225
 
It has been proven in the Canadian courts that as long as no per-
sonal or hobby element to an activity (such as a rental activity) 
exists, losses cannot be denied if there have never been profits 
or there may not be profits in the future. However, say you own a 
cottage that you and your family regularly use, but you also rent 
it out to others a few weeks a year. In this case, you’re supposed 
to report the rental income you receive on your tax return, and 
you’re also entitled to deduct some of your cottage expenses. 
Sounds inviting, huh? However, a personal element exists here, 
and because you’re essentially deducting some costs as rental 
expenses that you would have incurred even if you hadn’t rented 
out part of your premises (think of property taxes, insurance, 
maybe even mortgage interest), if you claim losses on that rental 
activity a “reasonable expectation of profit” test can be used to 
deny your losses. The lesson here? Don’t get greedy when looking 
for tax deductions.
Keeping Track of Property 
Improvements
Unless you’re a slumlord, you’re likely going to incur some expen-
ditures on your rental property. The question is whether you can 
deduct these expenses against your income.
Expenses of a property can be divided into two main categories: 
current expenditures and capital expenditures. Current expendi-
tures are the operating or recurring expenses that provide short-
term benefits. These expenditures tend to maintain or keep the 
property in the same shape. Think of your garden. You might pay 
someone to weed the flower bed, but alas, the weeds will grow 
back. The gardener is a current expense. Other examples include 
repairs and maintenance, window cleaning, heat, hydro, property 
tax, and interest expense on the mortgage. Capital expenditures, 
on the other hand, are the expenses of purchasing the property or 
substantially improving it. Capital expenditures are expenses that 
give lasting benefits that improve the property beyond its origi-
nal condition. Back to the garden. If you planted new trees and a 
perennial garden, these would be expected to last for many years. 
They would be a capital expenditure. Other examples of capital 
expenditures include major repairs to the property such as a new 
roof, additions to the property, new windows, new plumbing or 
electrical wiring, and a new furnace or coalscuttle. (We just men-
tioned coalscuttle because we like the word.)

Part III: Tips for Investors  
226
226
 
The key concept in determining whether a repair is a capital 
or current expenditure is the concept of betterment. If a repair 
improves what was initially there, it will be classified as a capital 
expenditure. If the repair only restores what was there initially, it 
is a current expense.
Capital expenditures are not expensed in the year of occurrence; 
rather, they are amortized or deducted over time using the capital 
cost allowance system, which we discuss in the next section.
 
Capital expenditures to assist the disabled are fully deductible in 
the year of occurrence. These expenses are given current-expense 
treatment in an attempt to encourage landlords to install them, 
and may include the following: installing hand-activated power 
door openers; installing ramps; modifying bathrooms, elevators, 
or doorways to accommodate wheelchairs; modifying elevators to 
assist the blind; and installing telephone devices for the hearing 
impaired and computer equipment or software to assist people 
who have disabilities.
Capital Cost Allowance
Capital cost allowance is a method of writing off the cost of a capi-
tal item over time, because the cost of capital assets cannot be 
deducted all at once in the year of acquisition (see Tip #32). The 
length of time that the tax laws permit you to “write off” the asset 
is supposed to represent the time it takes for the asset to wear out 
or become obsolete. The amount you’re allowed to deduct each 
year is called the capital cost allowance (or CCA).
How do I determine how 
much CCA I can claim?
The yearly amount of CCA you’re permitted to claim depends on 
the type of asset you own and when the asset was purchased. The 
Income Tax Act puts each type of asset into a specific asset group, 
or “class.” Each class has a predetermined amortization rate. For 
example, office furniture and equipment are class 8 assets, and 
therefore the cost of any new purchase of office furniture or equip-
ment gets added to this class. Think of it as a running total of the 
value of like-assets you own.
 
How do you know what class to put your capital asset in? The 
CRA’s Rental Income guide has a good discussion of CCA classes. 
See the CRA Web site at www.cra-arc.gc.ca.

 #44: Manage the Tax on Property Investments 227
Various CCA classes also have different rules regarding the treat-
ment of assets in the first year that their costs are added to the 
class. Most classes require you to use the “half-year rule” for new 
additions. This rule allows you to claim only half the normal CCA 
in the first year an asset is added to a class. This rule was designed 
to prevent individuals from buying assets on the last day of the 
year and claiming a full year of amortization (too bad!).
 
You don’t have to claim the maximum CCA every year. This is 
a discretionary deduction, meaning you can choose to claim any 
amount from zero to the maximum allowed. If you don’t owe tax in a 
particular year, for example, you may not wish to claim CCA that year 
and instead preserve your deduction for other tax years when you 
might need it. Remember, though, a maximum amount you can claim 
each year applies even if you forgo deductions in previous years. No 
double-dipping!
Combining rental income 
to calculate CCA
 
You can’t use CCA to create a loss on rental income. The govern-
ment requires you to combine all rental income and losses from all 
properties before calculating CCA. In this way, you’re prevented 
from using CCA to create or increase net rental losses.
Let’s say Jack owns two buildings. Both buildings are in class 1. 
The income and loss on the rental buildings are as follows:
Building 1
Building 2
Net income (loss) 
before CCA
$10,000
($15,000)
Because Jack has to combine the income of both buildings, he 
has a net rental loss of $5,000. Because Jack is in a net rental loss 
position, he cannot claim CCA on either building without increas-
ing the rental loss. If this rule did not exist, he could claim CCA on 
Building 1 to bring income to zero and claim no CCA on Building 2. 
The result would be a net rental loss of $15,000.
Foreign Rental Income
For tax purposes, you must include in your Canadian income any 
rental income that you receive on property located anywhere in 
the world, converted to Canadian dollars. The same rules and 

Part III: Tips for Investors  
228
228
restrictions apply to foreign-source rental income as apply to 
Canadian-source rental income, including the CCA rules.
 
If you also had to pay tax to another country on your foreign rental 
income, you may be eligible for a foreign tax credit when you cal-
culate your rental income for Canadian tax purposes. This system 
helps to ensure you’re not paying double the tax on the same 
income. See Tip #36 for more on investing in foreign property.
Calculating the Capital Gain or 
Loss from the Sale of Property
Rental buildings (but not the land, which is not considered to 
depreciate) and capital assets used to earn rental (and business) 
income — such as buildings used in a business, machinery, com-
puter equipment, or office furniture and equipment — are consid-
ered depreciable property. We talk about the CCA rules earlier in 
this tip. You can write off the cost of the property by claiming capi-
tal cost allowance over a number of years — meaning that at the 
time the asset is sold, undepreciated capital cost will likely be less 
than the original purchase price.
When you dispose of depreciable property, you may have a capital 
gain but not a capital loss — capital losses on depreciable prop-
erty are simply considered to be nil. That may seem unfair at first, 
but the tax implications don’t end there.
In addition to incurring a capital gain, you may also have recapture 
or a terminal loss. Recapture and terminal loss are adjustments 
you must make when you dispose of assets and find (based on 
your selling price) that the assets either were not depreciated 
enough over time, or were depreciated too much. To recapture 
means to reverse CCA taken in excess of the actual depreciation 
in value of the asset. To claim a terminal loss means to claim addi-
tional CCA when an asset has depreciated in value more than the 
allowed capital cost deductions. Neither recapture nor terminal 
losses can be claimed while assets are still in a CCA class (that is, if 
you had more than one asset of the same type being depreciated). 
When all assets in a class have been disposed of, you will be able 
to determine whether you over- or underdepreciated assets.

 #44: Manage the Tax on Property Investments 229
Let’s say Lisa sells her class 1 building for $1,000,000. She origi-
nally bought the building for $500,000. Over the years, she has 
claimed $300,000 of CCA. Because this building is the last asset in 
the class, we can calculate recapture or terminal loss. At the time 
of sale, Lisa’s undepreciated capital cost balance was $200,000 
($500,000 – $300,000 = $200,000).
Because the building increased in value and did not depreciate, Lisa 
had been entitled to CCA tax deductions in prior years that did not 
reflect the actual wear and tear of the building. Although the CCA 
deductions were valid at the time she took them (because the tax 
laws state how much you are entitled to deduct as CCA), now that 
Lisa is disposing of the asset she will be required to include $300,000 
of recapture in her income for the year of disposition.

Know the Implications of 
Purchasing U.S. Property
I
t’s an annual tradition for many Canadians: A trek down to the 
United States for a reprieve from our Canadian winters. Instead 
of renting, you might be thinking about buying your own property 
down south. But anytime you purchase a property in another country 
you’ll have tax implications, and that’s very true of property 
purchases in the U.S. In this tip we tell you what to watch out for.
Be Aware of the Implications 
of Receiving Rental Income
We’ve said it before and we’ll say it again. As a Canadian resident, 
you’re liable for Canadian tax on your worldwide income. If you’re 
earning rental income from your U.S. property, that income is 
taxable in Canada. (We talk about the Canadian taxation of that 
income in Tip #44.)
Your U.S. rental income is also taxable in the U.S., and you have 
some choices regarding how you fulfill your U.S. tax requirements.
Option 1: 30 percent withholding 
tax on gross rental income
Under this option, the gross rents you earn are subject to a 30 
percent withholding tax. Did you get the gross part? Under this 
method you’re not allowed a deduction for any expenses. This 
means a pretty hefty tax bill unless you have absolutely no deduc-
tions at all. This is an easy option, though, as you don’t have to 
file a U.S. tax return. You can claim a foreign tax credit for the 
withholding tax paid to the U.S.; however, be warned that you’ll 
not likely get a full foreign tax credit in Canada because you can’t 

 #45: Know the Implications of Purchasing U.S. Property 231
receive more Canadian tax via a foreign tax credit than the amount 
of tax payable to Canada on that income. So, in summary, this is 
the easy but expensive choice of the two.
Option 2: Net rental basis
Under this option, you’re required to file a U.S. non-resident tax 
return, called form 1040NR. On this form you’ll report your gross 
rental income as well as allowable deductions. These deductions 
may include mortgage interest, property taxes, insurance, utili-
ties, management fees, and advertising. A mandatory deduction 
for depreciation also applies. The gross income less deductions 
is equal to your net rental income, and it’s on this amount that 
you will pay U.S. tax. The tax you pay can be used as a foreign tax 
credit in Canada. Due to the allowable deductions, you’ll likely pay 
much less tax using this method. 
Selling a U.S. Property
When you sell your U.S. property, you’re required to report the 
sale on your Canadian tax return. If you sell the property for more 
than its tax cost, you’ll have to report a capital gain in Canada. In 
addition, because the property is physically located in the U.S., the 
U.S. has the right to tax the sale. You’re required to file a U.S. tax 
return to report the capital gain or loss and pay tax on any profit. 
Like the taxes on the rental income, any tax paid on the capital 
gain in the U.S. can be claimed as a foreign tax credit in Canada.
 
It may be possible to avoid taxes in Canada if the U.S. property is 
considered your principal residence.
 
Be very careful about gifting U.S. property. A U.S. gift tax may 
apply. In addition, if you keep the property for life, it’s possible 
that U.S. estate tax will be charged on a portion of your estate 
value. You’ll want to visit a cross-border tax pro to assess the 
damage and suggest solutions.

Pay Less on the Sale of 
Personal-Use Assets 
E
ven if you don’t have the extra cash to buy investments or 
start your own business, you may have personal items with 
nominal or even considerable value that you plan to sell. Further, 
you may have other assets such as a family home or cottage that 
you use personally. Because Canadians are taxed on all income 
earned worldwide in a year, as a general statement, any gains you 
bring in from selling those assets are taxable. Some special rules, 
however, can work in your favour to reduce the tax hit.
Taxing Personal-Use Property 
A personal-use property is an asset you hold and use for your own 
personal enjoyment. Common examples of personal-use property 
include your home, family vacation properties (such as your cottage 
or ski chalet), cars, boats, art, jewellery, and the like. The asset itself 
doesn’t make it qualify as a personal-use property; an asset is deter-
mined to be personal-use property through your use of the asset.
In most cases — with perhaps the exception of their homes and 
vacation properties — people are not affected by the capital gains 
rules when they own assets for their personal use. When you sell 
such property, usually you do not end up with a capital gain. This 
is because these types of property generally don’t increase in 
value over the years. In fact, because many personal-use assets 
depreciate in value, you may actually end up with a loss.
Although you have to report a capital gain on the sale of personal-
use property on your tax return, you’re not ordinarily allowed to 
claim a capital loss. (We agree that this seems unfair, but them’s 
the rules!) However, you can claim a loss under the following 
circumstances:
 
✓ If you disposed of personal-use property such as art or 
jewellery that is considered “listed personal property” 
(see the next section).

 #46: Pay Less on the Sale of Personal-Use Assets 233
 
✓ If a bad debt is owed to you from the sale of a personal-use 
property to a person with whom you deal at arm’s length (in 
other words, a non-related third party). In this case you can 
claim the bad debt owed to you as a capital loss.
Capital gains and, where allowed, capital losses incurred on per-
sonal-use property — that is not listed personal property — are 
reported in section 7 of schedule 3 (“Personal use property”).
To calculate any capital gain or loss realized when you dispose of 
personal-use property, follow these rules:
 
✓ If the adjusted cost base of the property is less than $1,000, its 
adjusted cost base is considered to be $1,000.
 
✓ If the proceeds of disposition are less than $1,000, the proceeds 
of disposition are considered to be $1,000.
 
If both the adjusted cost base and the proceeds of disposition are 
$1,000 or less, you don’t have a capital gain or a capital loss. Do 
not report the sale on schedule 3 when you file your return.
 
If you sell your home — your principal residence — for more 
than it cost you, you usually do not have to report the sale on your 
return or pay tax on any capital gain due to the principal residence 
exemption.
Taxing Listed Personal Property
Listed personal property (LPP) is a type of personal-use property 
that usually increases in value over time. Listed personal property 
includes the following capital properties:
 
✓ Rare manuscripts or rare books
 
✓ Prints, etchings, drawings, paintings, sculptures, or other 
similar works of art
 
✓ Jewellery
 
✓ Stamps and coins
Report capital gains or losses from selling such items in part 8 of 
schedule 3.
 
To determine the value of many of these items, you can have them 
appraised by book, art, jewellery, stamp, or coin dealers. Because 
listed personal property is personal-use property, the $1,000 mini-
mum proceeds of disposition and adjusted cost base rules apply.

Part III: Tips for Investors  
234
234
One very important difference, for tax purposes, exists between 
personal-use property that is not listed personal property and per-
sonal-use property that is listed personal property: If you have a 
loss when you dispose of listed personal property, these losses are 
not, well, lost. In fact, the losses can be used to offset gains gener-
ated on listed personal property this year, in the previous three 
years, or in any of the seven subsequent tax years.
 
Keep a record of your listed personal property losses that have 
not expired, so you can apply these losses against listed personal 
property gains in other years. A listed personal property loss 
expires if you do not use it by the end of the seventh year after it 
was incurred.
Minimizing Tax on Your Residence 
and Vacation Properties
When you sell your home, you may realize a capital gain — that is, 
you may make money on it. Congratulations! If the property was 
your only principal residence for every year you owned it, you 
don’t have to report the sale or the capital gain on your tax return. 
However, if at any time during the period that you owned the 
property it was not your principal residence, or you owned more 
than one property, you may have to report all or a portion of the 
capital gain and pay tax on it. In this section we explain the mean-
ing of a principal residence, how you designate a property as such, 
and what happens when you sell it so hopefully you can save a few 
bucks of tax.
 
If after reading this section you need more information, read the 
CRA’s Interpretation Bulletin IT-120R6, “Principal Residence,” avail-
able on the CRA Web site at www.cra-arc.gc.ca.
Determining your principal residence
Your principal residence can be a house, cottage, condominium, 
apartment, trailer, mobile home, or houseboat. A property qualifies 
as your principal residence for any year if it meets the following 
conditions:
 
✓ You own the property alone or jointly with another person.
 
✓ You, your spouse, your former spouse, or any of your 
children 18 years of age or younger lived in it at some time 
during the year. In the case of a vacation property, staying 

 #46: Pay Less on the Sale of Personal-Use Assets 235
there only occasionally during the year is okay; it can still be 
designated as your principal residence.
 
✓ You designate the property as your principal residence for 
the year. (You don’t need to make this designation until you 
sell, or are deemed to have sold for tax purposes, a property 
that can qualify for the principal residence exemption.)
 
The land on which your home is located can also be part of your 
principal residence. Usually, the amount of land you can consider 
part of your principal residence is limited to one-half hectare 
(about one acre). However, if you can show that you need more 
land to use and enjoy your home, you may consider more than this 
amount as part of your principal residence — for example, this 
may happen if the minimum lot size imposed by a municipality at 
the time you bought the property was larger than one-half hectare.
Figuring out whether you can have 
more than one principal residence
For 1982 and later years, you can designate only one home as your 
family’s principal residence for each year. If you’re married or are 
18 or older, your family includes you, your spouse (unless you 
were separated for the entire year), and your children (other than 
a child who was married during the year or who was 18 or older). If 
you’re not married or are not 18 or older, your family also includes 
your mother and your father, and your brothers and sisters (who 
were not married or 18 or older during the year).
For years before 1982, more than one housing unit per family could 
be designated as a principal residence. Therefore, for these years a 
husband and wife could designate different principal residences (for 
example, a house and a cottage) to help minimize capital gains (and 
taxes) on a sale. After 1982, only one residence per family can be 
named the principal residence. Therefore, it’s important to calculate 
the potential capital gains on each property you own so you can 
take maximum advantage of the principal residence exemption.
Disposition of your principal 
residence
When you sell your home, usually you don’t have to report the sale 
on your return and you don’t have to pay tax on any gain from the 
sale. This is the case if the home was your principal residence for 
every year you owned it. For many Canadians, this is a no-brainer 
because they have only one home.

236

However, for those fortunate enough to have a family cottage, or 
even more than one home, the principal residence exemption is 
not quite as straightforward. Things are complicated further if 
you didn’t actually live in the home, cottage, or whatever during a 
particular year. If your home was not your principal residence for 
every year you owned it, you have to report the part of the capital 
gain on the property that relates to the years when you did not 
designate the property as your principal residence.
 
If you have a loss when you sell, you’re not allowed to claim the 
loss because your home is considered personal-use property.
If only part of your home qualifies as your principal residence and 
you used the other part to earn income, you may have to split 
the selling price between the part you used for your principal 
residence and the part you used for other purposes (for example, 
rental or business purposes). You can do this by using square 
metres or the number of rooms, as long as the split is reasonable. 
Report only the gain on the part you used to produce income. 
Don’t worry, however, if the income-earning activity was ancillary 
to the main use of the residence (i.e., say you rented out a small 
portion of the house) and you have not claimed capital cost allow-
ance on the income-producing portion of the home in the past. In 
these cases, the whole residence can still be considered your prin-
cipal residence and no portion of any capital gain on sale will be 
taxable to you.
 
If you’re renting out a portion of your home, avoid claiming capital 
cost allowance (CCA) on that portion of the home. If you do, you 
won’t be able to shelter the entire gain using the principal resi-
dence exemption when you eventually sell the home.
If the principal residence exemption does not completely shelter 
the capital gain on the sale of a property, form T2091, “Designation 
of a Principal Residence,” will help you calculate the number of 
years for which you can designate your home as your principal 
residence, as well as the part of the capital gain, if any, that you 
have to report and pay tax on.
 
Include form T2091 with your return only if you have to report a 
capital gain. In other words, if your gain is fully sheltered by the 
principal-residence exemption, you don’t have to report anything 
on your tax return.

 #46: Pay Less on the Sale of Personal-Use Assets 237
Doing the math when selling 
a principal residence
If you sell a residence on which all the capital gain is not fully shel-
tered from tax by the principal residence exemption, the following 
formula calculates what portion of the gain is tax exempt:
1 + The number of years the home was designated as principal 
residence
Exempt gain equals (total number of years you owned the 
home after 1971) × gain
Because an individual can designate only one home as a principal 
residence for any given year, the 1 + in the formula allows you to 
protect the principal residence exemption when you sell and pur-
chase a home in the same year.

Know When to Deduct 
Investment-Related Expenses
I
f you’re an investor with a non-registered investment account, 
you likely incur expenses to manage the investments and 
account for the investment income you earn. It’s important to keep 
track of those expenses — many of them are tax deductible. 
Understanding What Expenses 
Are Deductible 
Certain expenses you incur to earn investment income are tax 
deductible. These include:
 
✓ Investment counsel and management fees (only the portion of 
these fees related to services for your non-RRSP investments 
are deductible)
 
✓ Safekeeping, custodial, and safety-deposit box fees
 
✓ Tax-return preparation fees, if you have income from a business 
or from your investments (sometimes called income from 
property). This includes interest, dividends, rents, and 
royalties.
 
✓ Interest on money borrowed to earn investment income, such 
as interest and dividends — but not capital gains
 
Brokerage commissions are not tax deductible as a carrying 
charge because they form part of the tax cost on the purchase 
of an investment or reduce the proceeds on the sale. In other 
words, these commissions will reduce your ultimate capital gain, 
or increase your capital loss on sale, but are not deductible on an 
annual basis against other sources of income.
 
Detail eligible carrying costs and interest in Part IV of schedule 
4 of your tax return, “Summary, Carrying Charges and Interest 
Expenses.” Then enter the total on line 221.

 #47: Know When to Deduct Investment-Related Expenses 239
 
At the time of writing, a set of draft rules (yes, they are still draft — 
the suspense is killing us!) in the Income Tax Act threatens to deny 
interest deductions and other investment expenses when no rea-
sonable expectation of cumulative profits exists (excluding capital 
gains) from the investment in question. Plainly stated, your deduc-
tions may be denied if you’re not expecting to earn enough interest 
and dividends from your investment over the expected holding 
period to cover your interest costs over that same period.
 
If you live in Quebec, you have additional rules to worry about. 
Specifically, for Quebec tax purposes, you can deduct interest (and 
other investment expenses) only to the extent you’ve reported 
investment income in the year. Investment income for these 
purposes includes taxable capital gains. Any interest that is not 
deductible can be carried forward to offset investment income you 
have in future years.
Special Deductions for Exploration 
and Development Investments
Did you invest in an oil and gas or mining venture? The type of 
investment may have been called a “limited partnership,” a “flow-
through share” investment, or simply a “tax shelter.” Whatever the 
term, if you did invest, you’re probably entitled to some special tax 
deductions. One of the attractive features promoted in the selling 
of oil, gas, and mining investments is the tax write-offs (slang for 
“deductions”) available.
 
If you’re contemplating an investment in an oil, gas, or mining ven-
ture, be sure you completely understand the risks associated with 
the investment. A general rule is that the greater the tax saving, the 
riskier the investment. Be sure that such an investment falls within 
your risk-tolerance comfort zone. Invest based on the quality of 
the investment — not the tax saving provided by the investment.
 
Why are these tax deductions made available? The government 
thinks it’s a good idea to encourage oil, gas, and metal explora-
tion in Canada, so the Act contains provisions to encourage these 
activities. The Act provides oil, gas, and mining companies with 
significant write-offs for the following:
 
✓ Canadian exploration expenses (CEE) — 100 percent deduction
 
✓ Canadian development expenses (CDE) — 30 percent deduction
 
✓ Canadian oil and gas property expenses (COGPE) — 10 percent 
deduction

Part III: Tips for Investors  
240
In addition, a temporary 15 percent mineral exploration tax credit 
is set to expire March 10, 2010. This credit was put in place by the 
government to help companies raise capital for mining exploration. 
Because many exploration companies do not have sufficient 
money to go out and explore for oil, gas, and metals, the Act per-
mits these companies to turn to you for the funds. You’re the one 
actually funding the exploration and development, so you get the 
attractive tax deductions. This is referred to as the expenses being 
“renounced” to you. Because exploration is the government’s main 
initiative, and the exploration phase has the greatest chance of 
failure, the write-offs are greatest when funds are expended on 
exploration.
The promoter of the oil, gas, or mining venture will provide you 
with all the information you need. Depending on the structure 
of the investment, you’ll receive a T101, T102, or T5013 slip. 
Instructions are provided on the back of these forms to assist in 
calculating your deduction.
 
You don’t have to take the maximum deduction. Any amount not 
claimed will carry over to the following year for a potential deduction 
using the same percentage figures. Why would you not want to take 
a deduction? Perhaps you expect to be in a higher tax bracket next 
year, so the deduction will be worth more in tax savings if you wait.

Make and Keep Interest 
Deductible
G
iven the large amounts of debt carried by Canadians, you 
want to ensure you get a tax break for the interest paid when-
ever you can. And lots of situations arise where the interest is 
deductible when the debts are properly structured.
 
Leveraged investing — that is, taking out a loan and using the 
proceeds to invest — is popular because you use other people’s 
money (usually the bank’s) to make money for yourself! The idea 
is that over the long term you can achieve higher effective rates 
of return on your investments and may even reach your financial 
goals faster than if you simply used your free cash flow to invest. 
And, of course, the interest on the loan is tax deductible. It does 
come with risks, though, so ensure you talk to your banker and 
financial advisor to see if it makes sense for you.
Determine When Interest Is 
Deductible on Your Tax Return 
The government makes it very clear when interest on debts is 
deductible for tax purposes. And if you’re planning to take out a 
loan and deduct the interest, you’ll want to ensure you are onside 
with those rules.
For your interest to be deductible, the following four criteria must 
be met:
 
✓ There must be an obligation to pay the interest costs.
 
✓ The interest costs must be paid or payable during the year.
 
✓ The interest costs must be reasonable.
 
✓ The borrowed money must be used to earn business income 
or income from property.

Part III: Tips for Investors  
242
242
When funds are borrowed from a bank or other lending institution, 
a legal obligation exists to pay the interest annually. And because 
the investor and the bank are not related to one another, it’s safe 
to say that the interest costs are reasonable. Therefore, provided 
the interest is paid during the year or the lender could legally 
enforce payment, it is clear that the first three criteria are met.
The fourth criteria states that the borrowed money must be used 
to earn business income or income from property. The term busi-
ness income is simple. It means you earn income from operating 
your own business or investing in someone else’s business. It gets a 
bit trickier when we consider income from property, which includes 
interest, dividends, rentals, and royalties — but not capital gains. 
The tax law is clear — when funds are used to generate primarily 
capital gains, the interest is not deductible.
The most common types of items purchased with debt where you 
will be able to deduct your interest include bonds, mutual funds, 
public company shares, and rental properties. Interest on debts 
incurred to purchase personal assets like a house is not deduct-
ible, although you’re able to use the equity in your home to secure 
a loan that is used for investment purposes. In that case the direct 
use of the borrowed funds is investing; therefore, the interest is 
deductible.
 
If you borrow to invest in an RRSP, your interest is not tax deduct-
ible. Consider using your tax refund to pay off at least part of your 
loan in order to keep your non-tax-deductible debt to a minimum.
Leveraged investing is not for everyone, because it’s considered 
risky. Ask yourself whether you have a long-term investment hori-
zon, sufficient personal cash flow to make loan payments (particu-
larly in years where the investment cannot generate the cash flow 
to support its loan), and a high risk tolerance.
 
Even if your interest cost exceeds your investment income, you’re 
still entitled to deduct the excess against other sources of income 
if you’re expecting income in the future. (Well, this last statement 
is not completely true. The excess of interest expense over invest-
ment income can be deducted for federal tax purposes, in all prov-
inces/territories except Quebec.)

 #48: Make and Keep Interest Deductible 243
Make Interest Tax Deductible
Many of us pay interest on personal borrowing, such as mortgage 
interest, car loans, lines of credit, and credit cards, but few of us 
can deduct that interest on our tax returns. A way exists, however, 
for some of us to convert that non-deductible interest into a tax 
deduction. This strategy is commonly known as debt-swapping.
Debt-swapping is possible if you have both non-deductible interest 
and non-RRSP investments such as shares, bonds, or mutual funds. 
Here’s how you do it:
 
1. Sell your investments, ideally choosing those that have 
not greatly appreciated in value since you purchased them 
(because you are responsible for paying tax on any capital 
gains you trigger on the sale).
 
2. Use the proceeds from the sale to pay down your non-
deductible debt.
 
3. Take out a new loan with the bank and use it to repurchase 
the investments you sold.
At the end of the day, you have the same amount of debt and the 
same amount in investments as before the sale (assuming you 
didn’t have tax to pay on any capital gains), but because a direct 
trace occurs between the borrowing and the investments, the 
interest you pay each year can be deducted on your tax return!
Keep the Interest Deductible
Just because the initial purpose of your borrowing is to invest, this 
does not mean you’re guaranteed a tax deduction for the interest 
paid in the future. To ensure your interest remains tax deduct-
ible, avoid withdrawing any capital from your investment account 
(which includes both the growth and any reinvested distributions) 
for personal purposes. Doing so will result in losing a portion of 
your interest deduction, unless you’re withdrawing the funds to 
put into another investment.
 
If you’ve borrowed to invest but later sell your investment at a 
loss, and use all the proceeds you have to pay down the loan, the 
interest on the remaining loan is still tax deductible.

Know What Tax Credits Are 
Available for You and 
Your Family
L
ots of non-refundable tax credits are available for you and 
your family — you just have to know which ones you can 
claim. Non-refundable tax credits directly reduce the amount of 
income tax you owe. In this way they differ from tax deductions, 
which are subtracted in computi 
ng your taxable income. 
These credits are referred to as “non-refundable” because if they 
exceed your tax you don’t get a refund of the excess.
For all but one of the non-refundable tax credits (the donation credit) 
the federal tax savings is 15 percent of the non-refundable tax credit 
amount to which you’re entitled. The federal non-refundable tax 
credits are indexed each year. This means you’re entitled to larger 
credit amounts — tax savings — as the years go on.
 
Report federal non-refundable tax credit amounts on schedule 1 
of your tax return. Each province/territory also calculates its own 
non-refundable tax credits to help offset provincial/territorial 
taxes. These credits are reported on your provincial/territorial tax 
calculation forms. 
Looking at the Basic Personal 
Credits for You, Your Spouse, 
and Your Children
Every Canadian can claim personal tax credits on the annual tax 
filing forms, and if you have a spouse and/or children or other 
dependants you might be able to claim credits for them as well. 
These credits mean you’re able to earn a basic amount of income 
each year and not pay tax on it.

Part IV:  Tips for Families  
248
Basic personal credit amount
Each and every Canadian filing a tax return is able to claim this 
credit. The amount changes every year, but it is in excess of 
$10,000. In other words, the first $10,000 or so of income you earn 
is not subject to tax!
Here’s how this actually works. Assume your taxable income is 
$10,000. The tax rate at this income level is 15 percent, so your tax 
equals $1,500. On schedule 1 you calculate the non-refundable tax 
credits available to you. If the basic personal amount is $10,000 
(and it’s likely more), the 15 percent tax credit equals $1,500. See a 
pattern? The tax credit completely offsets the tax, so your final tax 
liability is nil.
Spouse/common-law partner 
credit amount
The spouse/common-law credit amount is another credit worth at 
least $10,000. Again, the amount changes every year. Assuming the 
credit is $10,000 and you’re able to claim the full amount, the fed-
eral tax savings will be $1,500 ($10,000 × 15 percent).
How do you qualify? Well, first you have to have a spouse. For 
income tax purposes, “spouse” includes the person you’re legally 
married to or a person who is your common-law partner. (Of 
course, if you happen to have both, you can make a claim for only 
one these “spouses”!) Common-law partners are defined as two 
persons, regardless of sex, who cohabit in a conjugal relationship 
that has been continuous for at least 12 months or, if fewer than 12 
months, have a child, natural or adopted, together.
As you might have guessed, more qualifications exist. If your spouse 
had any net income for the year, the credit amount is reduced dollar 
for dollar. If your spouse’s income is greater than the credit amount, 
the amount available to you is reduced to zero. Your spouse’s net 
income is the amount reported on line 236 of his or her tax return.
If you separated during the year and were not back together by 
December 31, reduce the credit amount by your spouse’s net 
income before the separation only.
 
If you cannot claim the spousal amount (say, because the credit 
amount calculation works out to zero), or you have to reduce 
the credit claimed because of your spouse’s net income, you still 
may be able to claim the credit, or an increased credit amount, if 
your spouse’s income for the year includes dividend income from 

 #49: Know What Tax Credits Are Available for You and Your Family 249
Canadian corporations. You do this by claiming your spouse’s divi-
dend income on your return so that his or her income is lowered 
to permit the credit amount you claim — or, perhaps, a greater 
credit amount than originally calculated.
Child tax credit amount
If you have a child, then this credit is for you! The child tax credit 
amount is at least $2,000 for each child under the age of 18 at the 
end of the year. No receipts required! The credit amount changes 
each year, but assuming a credit of $2,000 the actual federal tax 
saving is $300 per child ($2,000 × 15 percent)!
 
If you don’t need all the child tax credit to reduce your federal tax 
to zero, you can transfer any of the unused portion to your spouse 
or common-law partner.
 
If you’ll be eligible to claim the child tax credit in the future, you 
might want to let your employer know so that your taxes at source 
can be reduced throughout the year. Otherwise, you have to wait 
until you file your tax return to benefit from the credit. You can 
inform your employer via a letter or by filling out form TD1 (you 
can download it from the CRA Website). Your payroll department 
should also have copies on hand.
Credit amount for an 
eligible dependant
This credit amount (often referred to by its previous moniker, the 
“equivalent-to-spouse” credit amount) of at least $10,000 is avail-
able to you if you have a dependant and you were single, divorced, 
separated, or widowed at any time during the year. In other words, 
you did not have a spouse/common-law partner, or if you did 
you were not living together. Not just any dependant will qualify 
for this credit — unfortunately, you can’t claim a credit for your 
28-year-old son who still lives in your basement, even if he does eat 
all your food. Your dependant must be the following:
 
✓ Your parent or grandparent
 
✓ Your child, grandchild, brother, or sister who was under 18 
or, if not under 18, was physically or mentally infirm
 
✓ Living with you in a home you maintain
This claim is usually made by a single parent for a child, although 
claims by children for a parent and by one sibling for another 

Part IV:  Tips for Families  
250
are fairly common as well. Give details of the claim for an eligible 
dependant (name, age, income) on schedule 5 of your tax return.
Like the spousal/common-law partner amount, the amount for an 
eligible dependant is reduced by the dependant’s income on a dollar-
for-dollar basis. If the credit this year is $10,000 and the dependant’s 
net income is $10,000 or greater, the credit amount for an eligible 
dependant will be zero. The actual credit amount will vary each 
year and is increased annually by the inflation rate.
 
You cannot claim this amount if someone else in your household is 
claiming it for the same dependant.
 
You can claim this credit for a dependant who lives away from 
home while attending school, if that dependant ordinarily lives 
with you when not in school.
Credit amounts transferred from your 
spouse/common-law partner
Your spouse/common-law partner can transfer to you any part of 
certain tax credit amounts that he or she qualifies for but does not 
need to reduce his or her federal income tax to zero.
 
The credit amounts that may be transferred from one spouse/
common-law partner to another are the age amount (Tip #67), the 
disability amount (Tip #61), the pension amount (Tip #67), and the 
tuition, education, and textbook amounts (Tip #56). For additional 
details and to calculate the amounts that can be transferred, refer to 
schedule 2 of your tax return. In the identification area on page 1 
of your return, be sure to report your marital status and your 
spouse/common-law partner’s name and social insurance number 
so your claim is not rejected.
Examining Additional Credits for 
Your Kids and Other Dependants 
In recognition that the costs of supporting dependants can be high, 
and in order to support parents and caregivers, other tax credits 
are available to help lessen the load. In addition to the credits 
below, if you have a disabled family member, other credits may be 
available to you. See Tip #62 for more details.

 #49: Know What Tax Credits Are Available for You and Your Family 251
Credit amount for adoption expenses
A non-refundable tax credit is available to help with adoption 
expenses. Eligible adoption expenses include fees paid to an adop-
tion agency; travel costs for the parents and child; and court, legal, 
and administration fees. The adoption can be within Canada, or 
international, to qualify. The expenses must be claimed in the year 
the adoption is finalized, and they can be shared by the parents. 
The total amounts claimed cannot exceed the lesser of the actual 
adoption expenses or a maximum per child. The actual maximum 
changes each year, but it is at least $10,600 per child. At a maximum 
of $10,600, the federal tax savings would be $1,590 ($10,600 × 15%)!
Keep your receipts for this one.
Children’s fitness tax credit amount
A credit of up to $500 is available to parents who pay to register 
a child in certain physical activity programs. The child must be 
under age 16 at the end of the year to qualify.
To be eligible for this credit, the program must be ongoing (at least 
once a week for eight weeks, or five consecutive days in the case of 
camps), supervised, and suitable for children.
The program also must include a significant amount of physi-
cal activity that provides cardiorespiratory endurance plus one 
or more of muscular strength, endurance, flexibility, or balance. 
Common Canadian activities that generally qualify include hockey, 
lacrosse, soccer, dance, and gymnastics, along with many others.
 
The maximum you can claim is the lesser of the actual cost paid 
or $500 per child. So, if karate camp costs $350, the maximum you 
could claim would be that $350. If that same child also took skat-
ing lessons that cost $125, your total claim for that child would be 
$475. On the other hand, even if you spend thousands on the activ-
ity, the most you can claim as a credit amount is $500 per child. 
Keep your receipts for any activities you put your children in 
during the year. Although the receipts don’t have to be filed with 
your tax return, the CRA might ask to see them later.

Income Split for Family 
Tax Savings
O
ne of the most effective ways for a family to save tax is to 
split income. Income splitting involves shifting income from 
the hands of one individual who pays tax at a high tax rate to 
another who pays tax at a lower tax rate. The result is that less tax 
is paid by the family! Of course, it’s not as easy as simply putting 
some of your income on your spouse or kids’ tax returns — some 
limitations do exist. But where it’s possible, income splitting can 
potentially save you a load of tax!
Why Income Splitting 
Can Save Tax
In Canada we pay tax at graduated rates. Basically, your taxable 
income is split into bands (or brackets), and income within each 
band is taxed at increasingly higher tax rates. If you have family 
members who are taxed in the lower bands, and you’re in a higher 
band, you can save on taxes if you can manage to get some income 
taxed to those family members.
Let’s look at some numbers. Say you’re an employee and earn a 
salary of $150,000. At this income level you’re taxed at the high-
est marginal tax rate. If you also earn investment income, all that 
income will be taxed at high tax rates because your salary has 
already pushed you into the highest tax bracket. If the highest 
marginal tax rate in your province is 45 percent and you earn 
$10,000 of interest income, you will pay $4,500 of tax on that inter-
est income alone! However, if you can manage to get that interest 
taxed in the hands of your spouse or children, and if they have no 
other sources of income, they will pay no tax on $10,000 of inter-
est. You’ve now saved $4,500 of tax as a family!

 #50: Income Split for Family Tax Savings
Watching Out for the 
Attribution Rules
To make income splitting difficult, the Income Tax Act includes a 
bunch of rules, called the “attribution rules,” which state that if 
you try to split or shift investment income (i.e., interest, dividends, 
and rents) to your spouse/common-law partner or to a minor child, 
grandchild, niece, or nephew, you — not they — will be taxed on the 
income earned on the invested funds. In addition, if you wish to split 
or shift capital gains with a spouse/common-law partner, you may 
find the attribution rules also work against you! Oddly, perhaps, the 
attribution rules will not negatively impact your plans to shift capital 
gains to your minor child. Hey, here’s a tax-planning opportunity! 
We talk more about this under “Loaning money to family members.” 
The good news is that we can tell you some ways around the attri-
bution rules (legal ways, of course!) so you can make income split-
ting work for you and your family.
Investigating Ways to Split Income
Income splitting isn’t necessarily easy. You can’t shift a salary to 
lower taxed family members. But when proper steps are taken, 
income splitting is possible with certain types of income — includ-
ing investment income, pension income, and business income.
Loaning money to family members
If you give your spouse or minor child funds to invest, the interest 
and dividends (in other words, the investment income) earned on 
the invested funds will be subject to tax in your hands — not in 
the hands of your spouse or minor child. The investment income 
earned will be “attributed” to you and your tax return, where it 
will be subject to tax at your tax rate. In other words, you’re in the 
same position as had you invested directly yourself — you have 
not successfully income split!
If you loan, instead of gifting, money to a spouse or minor child to 
be used for investment purposes, you can avoid the investment 
income earned on the loaned funds being taxed in your hands. 
However, as with everything, there’s a catch. Interest-free loans or 

Part IV:  Tips for Families  
254
even low-interest loans won’t cut it! To avoid the attribution rules, 
you must charge interest on the loan at an interest rate at least 
equal to the CRA’s prescribed interest rate at the time of the loan. 
Your spouse or minor child must pay the interest owing to you by 
no later than January 30 (not 31!) of the year following the year in 
which the interest was incurred — and it must be included in your 
income. Your spouse or minor child can deduct this interest from 
the income earned on the investment.
 
The CRA announces its prescribed interest rates every quarter. 
The rates can be found on the CRA’s Web site at www.cra-arc.
gc.ca/interestrates. (At the time of writing, the CRA’s pre-
scribed interest rate was a historically low 1 percent!)
You’ll manage to split income, and save tax, only if the investments 
earn a rate of return higher than the CRA’s prescribed interest rate 
at the time the loan is made.
 
You can lock in the prescribed interest rate that was in effect at 
the time the loan was made for the entire term of the loan, so 
you’re not at risk should the CRA’s prescribed interest rates go up 
in the future. If the rates drop, consider repaying your loan and 
taking out a new loan to lock in at the lower rate.
If you give money to a minor child to invest, the investment income 
(interest and dividends) will be taxed in your hands. However, if 
the funds were invested and capital gains were incurred (due to 
a sale of an investment where proceeds are greater than the cost 
of the investment, or a capital gain allocated from a mutual fund), 
the capital gain will not be taxed in your hands — it will be taxed 
in the hands of the child. Individuals can have a taxable income of 
up to about $10,000 because of your basic personal amount (which 
changes annually) and pay no tax — a minor child can actually 
report capital gains of double that and pay no tax, because only 50 
percent of capital gains are subject to tax.
 
If you’re giving a minor child funds to invest, make sure the invest-
ments focus on generating capital gains (stocks and equity-based 
mutual funds) as opposed to interest and dividends. If you’re look-
ing for a more balanced investment mix, corporate-class mutual 
funds will avoid generating interest income, even though the under-
lying investment exposure could be traditional interest-bearing 
investments.
Using second-generation income
If you give or lend money to a spouse or minor child to invest (with 
no interest or at an interest rate below the CRA prescribed interest 
rate at the time of the loan), any income earned on the investments 

255
will be attributed back to you and taxed in your hands. The good 
news? Second-generation income — that is, “income on income” — 
is not attributed back. 
Second-generation income works like this: Lend or give money to 
your spouse or minor child, then transfer any income earned each 
year to a separate investment account in the spouse’s or minor 
child’s name. Future earnings in that second account are not sub-
ject to the attribution rules. Income splitting has been achieved!
Using trusts to income split
You might want to income split but are uncomfortable with giving 
your money directly to a family member, especially one with a 
love for fast cars or expensive handbags. You get the drift. In these 
cases, you could gift or loan funds into a family trust instead. With 
a trust, your family member benefits from the funds in the trust, 
but does not necessarily get direct access to the funds. They are, 
however, taxed on the investment income each year; although 
you still need to give heed to the attribution rules. A common 
reason for setting up a family trust occurs when you have a fairly 
significant wealth level, pay for your child’s expenses out of your 
after-tax income (think private school), and want to income split. 
You can put money in the trust and have the trust pay the child’s 
expenses instead. If you’re the right league for a trust, speak to a 
tax professional; specific paperwork must be drawn up.
Splitting retirement income
If you’re retired or nearing retirement, consider these easy and 
effective ways to use income splitting to pay less tax on your 
retirement income. 
First, for those already retired, up to 50 percent of certain pension 
income can be split, shifted, or allocated from a high-tax-bracket 
spouse to a lower-tax-bracket spouse. This results in the couple 
paying less tax! Many types of income can be split, including 
income from an employer pension plan and RRIF income if you’re 
over the age of 65. See Tip #68 for all the details.
 
Pension splitting may serve to permit another pension credit 
amount of up to $2,000 for a spouse age 65-plus who otherwise 
would not be eligible.
 
Be wary of the impact of the increase in income of the lower-income 
spouse as a result of pension splitting. The extra income can cause 
a reduction in the age credit amount (Tip #67), as well as causing or 
increasing the Old Age Security (OAS) clawback (Tip #64).
 #50: Income Split for Family Tax Savings

Part IV:  Tips for Families  
256
Next, married or common-law partners who are at least 60 and live 
together can elect to share CPP payments on the portion of CPP 
earned during their time together. A portion of CPP payments of 
a high-tax-bracket individual can be shifted — or shared — with a 
lower-tax-bracket individual. This will result in tax savings for the 
couple!
 
If only one individual was a CPP contributor, the two individuals 
can share one pension. Remember, you must apply to share your 
CPP pension!
Finally, for those still saving for retirement, your optimum goal 
is for each spouse/common-law partner to have equal incomes 
during retirement. This will accomplish perfect income splitting 
and keep the total family tax bill to a minimum. You can achieve 
this by using spousal RRSPs. Spousal RRSP contributions work 
like this: You contribute to an RRSP under which your spouse is 
the annuitant. You claim the tax deduction for the amounts put 
into the plan, and when money is withdrawn for retirement, your 
spouse is taxed on the withdrawal. Talk about shifting retirement 
income from one spouse to the other! (See Tip #42 for more on 
spousal RRSPs.)
 
Even with the new pension-splitting rules, contributing to a spou-
sal RRSP remains a sound tax-planning idea for a number of rea-
sons. Spousal RRSPs are still a way to income split for those who 
are not yet a “senior” — say, to fund a maternity or education 
leave or for early retirement. The types of pension income eligible 
for pension splitting are quite restrictive for those under 65.
Paying wages to family members
If you have your own business, consider paying a salary or wage to 
members of your family. Of course, they must actually work in the 
business (and no, you won’t get away with paying your 4-year-old 
son to colour pictures you use for advertising or your 2-year-old 
daughter to lick stamps). In addition, the salary you pay them must 
be reasonable for the work they do.
 
The advantage to paying wages to family members is that you can 
claim the amount paid as a deduction on your business statement, 
so your taxable income and your taxes are reduced. On the flip 
side, the family member includes this amount in his or her income. 
You can pay a child who has no other source of income up to their 
basic personal amount (over $10,000 per year, and the amount 
increases annually) without generating a tax bill for that child. 
Assuming your marginal tax rate is 45 percent, that’s a savings of 
about $4,500 in tax!

257
Transferring money for 
business purposes
If you give or lend money to family members to use in a business 
as opposed to for investing, you can avoid the dreaded attribu-
tion rules. Even if it’s a loan, there’s no need to charge interest. 
Because the funds will earn business income and not investment 
income or capital gains, you don’t have to worry about having the 
business income or gains taxed in your hands.
Investing more for lower-income 
family members
If your ultimate goal is to invest your funds for the future, you 
would like the investments to be made by a family member who 
will pay the least amount of tax on those investments. You can 
accomplish this for a spouse and for children in various ways.
One way to get more funds into the hands of the lower-income 
spouse is to have the higher-income spouse pay all the daily living 
expenses. This includes groceries, mortgage or rent payments, 
credit card bills, gas for the car, and so on. This frees up more 
cash in the hands of the lower-income spouse to earn investment 
income that is taxed at a lower tax rate.
 
Another idea is for the higher-income spouse to pay the income tax 
liability and instalments of the lower-income spouse. Because the 
amount is not invested by the spouse, the attribution rules won’t 
apply. Any funds the lower-income spouse would have used to pay 
the tax liabilities are now free to be used for investment purposes.
You can also invest for children in a tax-effective manner. One way 
is to use the government benefits paid on behalf of the child for 
investment purposes. This includes the non-taxable Canada Child 
Tax Benefit (CCTB) that is paid monthly to qualifying families until 
their children reach 18 years of age. The amount paid varies based 
on the family’s income. It also includes the taxable Universal Child 
Care Benefit (UCCB), which is paid to all families with a child 
under 6. The payment is $100 per month.
 
Both these benefit payments can be invested in your child’s name 
and earn any type of income without the attribution rules kicking 
in. Make sure these funds are deposited directly into an invest-
ment account for your child.
You can also invest for a child tax-efficiently using registered educa-
tion savings plans (RESPs). These plans are used to help build an 
 #50: Income Split for Family Tax Savings

Part IV:  Tips for Families  
258
education fund for your child or grandchild. But RESPs are also a 
great way to income split. Although contributions made to an RESP 
are not tax deductible, they do grow tax free. When the funds are 
taken out for educational purposes, you won’t be the one to foot 
the tax bill. The income earned in the plan is taxed in the child’s 
hands, not yours. (See Tip #51.)
Registered disability savings plans (RDSPs) also allow parents to 
save funds, in a tax-efficient manner, to provide for a disabled child. 
The purpose of these plans is to provide for the long-term financial 
security of an individual who has a prolonged and severe physical 
or mental impairment. Just like an RESP, contributions made to an 
RDSP are not tax deductible, but they do grow tax free. When the 
funds are taken out, they are taxable in the hands of the disabled 
person, which again achieves income splitting. (See Tip #63.)
Income splitting after 
death using trusts
If you expect to leave or receive an inheritance that will end up 
being invested, consider a special kind of trust called a testamen-
tary trust to provide income splitting after death. A testamentary 
trust is provided for in your will and requires your heirs to hold 
their inheritance in a trust instead of in their personal names. 
Many benefits to this structure exist, but from our standpoint the 
advantage is tax savings!
A testamentary trust is taxed like an individual with graduated tax 
rates. So, if an heir already earns income and is taxed at a fairly high 
tax rate, any investment income earned from the investment of the 
inheritance would lose quite a chunk to tax annually. By instead 
having the trust pay the tax on the investment income, your heir can 
essentially income split with the trust after you’re gone. 
 
A testamentary trust must be provided for in your will, so if this 
would be to your benefit, speak to a lawyer. And if you would ben-
efit from having a trust for an inheritance you might receive in the 
future, speak to the person who will be leaving money to you to 
see if they would provide for such a trust in his or her will. Tip #73 
discusses using trusts in your tax and estate planning.

Fund Your Child’s Education 
Tax-Effectively
T
he cost of postsecondary education in Canada is rising, and 
with students graduating with ever larger debts many parents 
are thinking about a head start on saving for education. In this tip 
we suggest some tax-effective ways to save for a child’s education, 
the most popular being the RESP.
Using RESPs for Tax Benefits
Registered education savings plans, or RESPs, are one of the most 
popular and effective ways for Canadians to save for a child’s edu-
cation. In a nutshell, here’s how they work: A “subscriber” (usu-
ally a parent or grandparent, but it could be someone else) places 
funds in the plan for a child’s benefit. Although no tax deduction 
for RESP contributions applies (like exists for RRSP contributions), 
funds within the plan can grow tax-sheltered. Plus, the government 
provides an extra bonus, the Canada Education Savings Grant, to 
help pump up the savings!
Contributing to an RESP
Contributions to an RESP can be made at a bank, through your 
investment advisor, or through companies that specialize in these 
types of plans. You need to have a social insurance number for the 
child, and the child has to be a resident of Canada.
 
No annual limits to what you can contribute to an RESP apply, 
although the lifetime limit is $50,000 per child.
The federal government currently kicks in an additional 20 percent 
of the amount contributed to an RESP, to a maximum of $500 per 
year per child. The extra 20 percent is called the Canada Education 
Savings Grant, or CESG. You will get the maximum grant each year 
if you contribute $2,500 per child, but if you happen to miss a year 
don’t worry — the grant room carries forward. The most grant 
the government will pay in a year if you missed out on prior-year 

Part IV:  Tips for Families  
260
grants is $1,000, which would be received with a $5,000 contribu-
tion. For years you missed prior to 2007, the maximum grant is 
$400. Don’t miss out on free money for your child’s education!
 
The CESG increases to 40 percent for the first $500 contributed by 
families with income up to about $40,000. Where family income is 
between about $40,000 and $80,000, the CESG will be 30 percent of the 
first $500 contributed. Note that these income levels change annually 
and are only approximate. If you’re looking for the exact thresholds 
for the increased CESGs, visit the CanLearn Web site at www.can-
learn.ca/eng/saving/. Whatever the income level, the maximum 
CESG a child is eligible for is $500 per year and $7,200 per lifetime.
Contributions can be made into an RESP for 31 years, which will 
be helpful if your children decide to go on with their schooling at a 
later age or if you have a family plan. You also can make contribu-
tions for a beneficiary who is up to age 31. If the beneficiary quali-
fies for the disability tax credit, contributions can be made up to 
age 35. However, in most cases to receive the CESG the beneficiary 
must be no more than 15 years old during the calendar year. You 
might qualify for a CESG at the age of 16 and 17 if at least $2,000 
had been contributed into RESPs for that child prior to age 16 and 
at least $100 per year was contributed in any four years before the 
year the child turns 16. Confused? If your child is 16 and never had 
an RESP before, no CESG will be paid.
 
Even if you don’t have the funds to contribute to your child’s 
RESP, you might be eligible for a Canada Learning Bond to help 
you get a kick-start on education savings. If your child was born 
after December 31, 2003, and you receive the National Child Benefit 
Supplement, the government will start off the RESP with $500, plus 
deposit $100 a year for up to 15 years as long as you receive the 
National Child Benefit Supplement.
For free brochures on RESPs, the CESG, and the Canada Learning 
Bond, call 1-800-O-CANADA.
Earning investment 
income in an RESP
After you set up the RESP and contribute funds into it, the next 
step is to choose investments — because it’s the growth of the 
investments that will help pump up the RESP value and provide 
more funds for the child’s education. 
The investment income earned by an RESP is not taxable each 
year, so the earnings can grow on a tax-deferred basis. This helps 
the RESP grow at a faster rate than if tax had to be paid each year. 

261
 
#51: Fund Your Child’s Education Tax-Effectively
Understanding What Happens 
When Your Child Goes to 
Postsecondary School
When your child goes to school, and is age 16 or older, it’s time to 
start making withdrawals from the RESP. The payments are known 
as Education Assistance Payments (EAP). 
Taxing RESP withdrawals 
while in school
The EAP has two portions. The first is the accumulated investment 
income earned in the plan and the second is the CESG that has 
accumulated. 
The EAP from the RESP is considered to be tax deferred because it 
does eventually become taxable. It becomes taxable income of the 
student when he or she removes the money for educational pur-
poses. However, the advantage of having the tax paid by the stu-
dent is that the student probably has little or no other income and 
can claim the tuition, education, and textbook credits to reduce 
any tax he or she may owe (see Tip #56). It’s quite possible there 
will be no tax at all to pay on the withdrawals in the future. 
 
It’s not until funds are withdrawn from the plan that tax is payable, 
and only the growth (including growth derived from the CESG) in 
the plan is taxable.
You might be wondering about your initial contributions. Because 
no deduction is available for contributions, it doesn’t make sense 
that the withdrawal of your contributions would be taxable. So, 
you or the student is able to withdraw the original contributions 
out of the plan without any tax implications. 
 
Full-time students can withdraw only up to $5,000 of EAP in the 
first 13 weeks of enrollment. Part-time students are limited to 
$2,500 in that time frame. After that, the withdrawals must be rea-
sonable to fund the education needs, although no specific restric-
tion exists on what the funds are used for. 

Part IV:  Tips for Families  
262
Investigating what types of 
educational programs qualify
RESP withdrawals to be taxed to the student can be made only if 
the child is attending a qualifying education program on a full- or 
part-time basis. For full-time students the program must be at the 
postsecondary level and last at least three consecutive weeks. 
It must require the student to spend no fewer than ten hours 
per week on courses and work in the program. For part-time stu-
dents the student must spend at least 12 hours per month on the 
courses. The course must last at least three consecutive weeks at 
the postsecondary level.
Proof of enrollment is necessary to receive an EAP. Contact the 
school for the necessary paperwork.
Examining the Options If Your 
Child Doesn’t Go On to School
If the beneficiary of the RESP does not attend an institution of 
higher education, the contributions and the income earned from 
these contributions (accumulated income payments) can be 
returned to the contributor. The initial contributions can be with-
drawn tax free, but the accumulated income can be withdrawn 
only when one of the following circumstances applies:
 
✓ The plan must have existed for at least ten years, and the ben-
eficiary must be at least 21 years of age and not be attending 
an institution of higher learning.
 
✓ The beneficiary of the RESP has died.
 
✓ The plan has been in existence for 35 years. An RESP has to 
be closed by December 31 of the 35th anniversary year of the 
plan (it’s 40 years if the beneficiary is entitled to the disability 
tax credit). Prior to 2008, a 25-year limit existed. This caused 
some issues when there was a large age gap between the chil-
dren who were beneficiaries of the plan, and one or more of 
the children had not yet begun postsecondary education. The 
extra ten years will help to alleviate this problem.
If these requirements are met, the contributions and the accu-
mulated income can be withdrawn, although the CESGs and any 
Canada Learning Bond payments received by the RESP must be 
paid back to the federal government. Any growth in the RESP due 
to the CESGs being invested can be withdrawn. CESG repayments 
are not taxable.

263
Any income returned to the contributor is taxable, and a special 
penalty surtax of 20 percent applies on top of the regular tax pay-
able on this income. The surtax can be completely or partially 
avoided when the accumulated income is transferred directly to 
the contributor’s RRSP. The maximum amount that can be trans-
ferred is subject to a lifetime limit of $50,000. Sufficient RRSP con-
tribution room must be available to transfer funds to an RRSP. If 
the contributor passes away, the contributor’s spouse can make 
use of the RRSP transfer option instead.
Exploring Other Options 
for Education Savings
RESPs clearly have some tax benefits but also some drawbacks, 
particularly if the child does not go on to school. In addition, if you 
plan to fully fund your child’s postsecondary education, you might 
find that the limits imposed by the RESP will not allow you to save 
enough over the long run. In these cases you may need to use 
other savings plans to top up the savings.
One way to save for the child is to set up an in-trust account. With 
an in-trust account you contribute money into an investment 
account that is held for the child’s benefit. If the account is set up 
so that the funds are essentially a gift to the child, the child (not 
the parent) will pay tax on any capital gains earned each year at 
assumedly a lower tax rate than the parent would pay. Interest and 
dividends would be attributed back to the contributing parent or 
grandparent and taxed in that contributor’s hands. Sound too good 
to be true? The big drawback to an in-trust account is that when 
the child reaches the age of majority the funds can be withdrawn 
and used for any purpose the child so chooses.
If you don’t like the idea of the child accessing the funds, you 
might simply want to save in your own account, and earmark the 
funds for education savings. That way you still pay tax on any 
investment earnings each year, but you can keep the funds in the 
future if the child doesn’t go to school.
 
If you save funds in your TFSA and earmark them for education 
savings, you won’t pay tax on the investment earnings each year, 
and the child won’t have access to the funds at age of majority. See 
Tip #41 for more details.
 
If you don’t save enough for postsecondary education, or if you 
simply don’t intend to fund all the costs, don’t forget there are 
many sources of funds out there for your children to explore 
including government loans, bank loans, scholarships, bursaries, 
and good old summer jobs.

Know What Benefits Are 
Available for Your Children
R
aising children is an expensive endeavour; those costs are 
even higher when you have a disabled child. In this tip we 
offer some additional benefits available if you have young children 
or a disabled child.
 
Even if you’re not in a taxable situation, you should still file a tax 
return if you have children. Refer to Tip #3 for ideas on how to get 
free money from the government via the tax system.
Getting the Universal 
Child Care Benefit
Starting in July 2006, the government began paying families $100 
per month for each child under the age of 6 in a household. This 
Universal Child Care Benefit is meant to provide financial support 
for childcare for preschool children, although it’s not required that 
the child actually attends preschool for this benefit to be paid.
The Universal Child Care Benefit is taxable to the lower-income 
spouse (or the recipient, where two parents are not living together). 
You must include the payments you received on your income tax 
return on line 117 (but don’t worry — you’ll receive statement RC62 
showing the amount you received during the year). These payments 
will not affect your entitlement to Old Age Security, Employment 
Insurance, or the childcare expense deduction, where applicable.

265
 
#52: Know What Benefits Are Available for Your Children
 
You must apply to receive the Universal Child Care Benefit. An 
application can be found at www.cra-arc.gc.ca/E/pbg/tf/
rc66/. With payments of up to $1,200 per year, per child, it’s 
worth your while even if it is taxable!
Claiming Disability Amounts 
If you have a disabled child, the child might be eligible for a dis-
ability tax credit and disability supplement to help reduce taxes 
payable. However, the child may not have any income, so these 
credits go wasted. If you have a disabled dependant, be sure to 
read Tip #62 where we cover all the bases.

Understand the Tax 
Implications of a Marriage 
Breakdown
M
oney and finances are usually a big stressor when it comes 
to divorce. The lawyers will usually help hash out the finan-
cial settlements, but the tax implications to those settlements can 
play a big role in how much you actually have to shell out or how 
much you will receive in the settlement. Taxes should never be 
ignored in a marriage breakdown.
Support Payments
Support is a word synonymous with “alimony” and “maintenance” 
payments. Support refers both to payments made for spousal sup-
port and to payments made for child support. It’s important to dif-
ferentiate between spousal and child support because each has its 
own criteria regarding permissible tax deductions.
 
You’ll see that the deduction/income inclusion criteria for support 
payments mirror each other. Where one taxpayer has a deduction, 
one will have an income inclusion. If no deduction is available, no 
income inclusion applies. 
 
Though it can be emotionally draining to go through the process 
of finalizing the agreement, our experience in dealing with many 
separated and divorced individuals is that the agreement is vital in 
maintaining some sanity and in ensuring your financial protection. 
Contact a lawyer specializing in family law as soon as possible to 
protect your rights to support, your assets, and your children.
Spousal support
Payments to an ex-spouse — including an “estranged” (separated) 
spouse — are in most cases tax deductible, and on the flip side, 
taxable to the recipient. To support the deduction, you must have 
a written agreement or court order signed by both you and your 
ex-spouse that specifically stipulates the amounts to be paid. If 

267
 #53: Understand the Tax Implications of a Marriage Breakdown
no agreement or court order exists, the amounts paid are not tax 
deductible. However, an agreement can provide for at least some 
of the pre-agreement spousal support payments to be tax deduct-
ible, as we explain later in this section.
 
The support payments must be periodic; that is, monthly. Lump-
sum payments do not qualify for a tax deduction.
 
Any payments you made prior to the date of a court order or a 
written agreement can be considered to have been paid under an 
order or agreement, and therefore are tax deductible. However, 
the order or agreement must stipulate that any prior payments 
made are considered to have been paid (and therefore are poten-
tially deductible) pursuant to the agreement. Only payments made 
in the year that the order or agreement is finalized, and the preced-
ing year, qualify for the retroactive treatment. Get the separation 
agreement drawn up promptly!
Child support
Child support rules took a dramatic shift over ten years ago. Three 
sets of rules are now in place, and you need to determine which 
ones apply to you. Your child support payments may or may not be 
tax deductible/taxable. The three sets of rules are detailed below.
Child support order or agreement made before May 1, 1997
If you’re making payments under an order or agreement made before 
May 1, 1997, your payments are tax deductible. The ex-spouse receiv-
ing the payments will include the amounts in his or her income.
Child support order or agreement made on 
May 1, 1997, or later
Payments made under a May 1, 1997, or later agreement or order are 
not tax deductible and are not taxable in the hands of the recipient.
Modification of a pre–May 1, 1997, child 
support order or agreement
If you’re making tax-deductible payments under a pre–May 1, 1997, 
order or agreement, you may find your payments suddenly cease 
to be tax deductible (and the payments received no longer tax-
able) under one of the following circumstances:
 
✓ The order or agreement is amended to increase or decrease 
child support payments (and, therefore, considered a new 
agreement and subject to the new rules).
 
✓ You and your ex-spouse elect to have the newer rules apply to 
your old agreement.

Part IV:  Tips for Families  
268
Recognizing When to Deduct 
Legal Expenses
In the past, very few legal expenses incurred on a marriage break-
down were deductible. However the rules have been expanded and 
now cover off many more types of legal costs, including costs to
 
✓ Obtain an order for child support
 
✓ Collect late support payments
 
✓ Establish the amount of support payments
 
✓ Seek to obtain an increase in your support payments
 
✓ Seek to make child support non-taxable
However, you cannot claim the costs to get a separation or 
divorce, or to establish custody or visitation arrangements for 
your children.
 
You’re not permitted to claim legal costs you incur to establish, 
negotiate, or contest the amount of support payments you pay.
 
Ensure your lawyer details the bill such that fees for tax-deductible 
services are highlighted!
Distinguishing Which Parent Can 
Claim Dependant Credits
If you’re a single parent, you’re able to claim a credit amount for 
an eligible dependant. This used to be known as the “equivalent-
to-spouse” credit. Basically it’s like getting another basic personal 
credit in order to give you some tax help for supporting a house-
hold with a dependant on your own. 
This credit is available if you have a dependant and you were 
single, divorced, separated, or widowed at any time during the 
year (so it’s not solely available on marriage breakdown). You can 
find a full discussion on who qualifies in Tip #49.
 
A claim isn’t allowed if you were required to make support pay-
ments for the dependant child during the year.
Other credits you might qualify for after your marriage is dissolved 
include:

269
 
✓ GST credit for you and your children. If you share custody, 
the government will put you on a shared eligibility schedule 
for the GST credit.
 
✓ Canada Child Tax Benefit. Again, a shared eligibility schedule 
may apply. 
 
✓ Amount for children aged 18 or younger. You and your ex 
must negotiate who will claim this credit. It cannot be shared 
and cannot be claimed by more than one person. If you can’t 
agree, no one is allowed to make a claim. 
Taxing Assets Transferred on 
a Marriage Breakdown
In the course of your negotiations, you’ll have to discuss who is 
going to get what. The “what” might include assets such as regis-
tered assets, non-registered investment accounts, the family home, 
vacation properties, and pension assets. 
From a tax standpoint, assets can pass between spouses on a mar-
riage breakdown without current tax implications. For example, 
registered assets such as an RRSP can simply be rolled from one 
spouse’s RRSP to the other. And assets that might have appreci-
ated in value such as stocks or mutual funds held in non-registered 
accounts, or a vacation property, can transfer at their tax costs 
instead of at their current values, which might give rise to capital 
gains.
This is not to say tax never applies on these assets. The recipi-
ent spouse will have to pay tax on registered assets any time a 
withdrawal is made, and that withdrawal is taxed at that person’s 
marginal tax rate. And although the capital gain on other assets is 
deferred, it does become taxable upon sale. At the time of disposi-
tion the capital gain is calculated as the difference between the 
final sales price and the original tax cost of the asset, not the value 
at the time of marriage breakdown.
 
Ensure the embedded tax liabilities are taken into account during 
your negotiations. If one person gets the family house, where no 
tax would ever be payable because of the principal residence 
exemption, and the other person gets RRSP assets, the RRSP assets 
would be worth much less after tax.
 
You must complete special tax forms to avoid paying tax on the 
transfer of the assets. For RRSP assets, fill out form T2220 and 
ensure the assets are transferred directly from one registered 
account to another.

Claim Childcare Expenses
O
ur government recognizes that many of us incur childcare 
expenses in order to be able to work, go to school, or train 
for a job. If you pay childcare expenses, make sure you get the 
most bang for your buck, tax-wise!
Finding Out What Types of 
Expenses Are Deductible
To claim a deduction for a child, the child must be your child, 
your spouse’s child, or a child dependant on you or your spouse; 
and the child must have a net income less than the basic personal 
amount (about $10,000 but the amount changes each year).
Eligible childcare expenses include payments to the following:
 
✓ Individuals providing childcare services. This could be a nanny, 
a home daycare, or payments to a babysitter while you’re 
at work. Payments to the child’s mother, father, or a related 
person under 18 are not eligible. Individuals providing child-
care must provide a receipt with their social insurance number 
noted. Other childcare providers simply need to provide you 
with a receipt.
 
✓ Daycares, childcare centres, and day nursery schools
 
✓ Schools where part of the fee is for childcare (such as before- 
and after-school care)
 
✓ “Day” camps and “overnight” camps
 
Sports lessons, such as your child’s weekly swimming lesson or 
dance class, are not considered a childcare expense. However, 
they may qualify for the children’s fitness tax credit.
Discovering the Maximum 
Claim Amount
Childcare can be expensive. However, limits are placed on the maxi-
mum amount you can claim as a tax deduction. Here are the maxi-
mum childcare expenses that can be claimed per eligible child:

271
 #54: Claim Childcare Expenses
Disabled child — regardless of age
$10,000
Child under age 7 on December 31 of the year
$7,000
Child aged 7 to 16 on December 31 of the year
$4,000
For example, if you hired a nanny and paid her $12,000 in the year 
to watch your 4-year-old child, you can claim only $7,000 as a tax 
deduction.
 
The maximum deductible is also restricted to two-thirds of your 
“earned income.” Don’t get the definition of earned income for pur-
poses of the childcare deduction mixed up with the definition of 
earned income for your RRSP deduction. For purposes of the child-
care expense deduction, earned income consists of:
 
✓ Employment income, including tips and gratuities
 
✓ Self-employment income
 
✓ Research grants
 
✓ CPP/QPP disability benefits
 
✓ Government payments under a plan to encourage 
employment
So, say you earn $10,000 in the year from a part-time job. Your 
spouse earns $60,000 per year. You have your 3-year-old child in 
preschool and pay $8,000 per year for that. Your childcare deduc-
tion is the lower of $7,000 (the maximum childcare deduction for 
a child under the age of 7) and $6,667 (two-thirds of your income). 
Therefore, you can claim only $6,667 as a childcare deduction.
 
Where payments are made to facilities providing overnight lodging 
and boarding, such as overnight sports schools, boarding schools, 
or camps, the eligible deductible amount is restricted to:
 
✓ $175 per week per disabled child of any age
 
✓ $175 per week per child under age 7 on December 31 of the 
year
 
✓ $100 per week per child aged 7 to 16 on December 31 of the 
year
 
Complete form T778, “Child Care Expenses Deduction,” when 
you file your tax return to provide the CRA with all the details it 
requires to assess your childcare claim.

272
Determining Who Claims 
Childcare Expenses
If a child lives with both parents, the parent with the lower income 
claims the childcare expense deduction. However, as with every-
thing, exceptions apply to this general rule.
 
Are you the only supporting person? If so, you make the claim for 
the childcare expenses deduction.
Creating income to avoid 
wasting the deduction
 
Where one of two supporting persons has no net income, the 
deduction for childcare expenses will be “wasted.” We often see 
this when someone is self-employed but has so many business 
expenses in the year that no net income exists. Therefore, where 
possible, try to ensure the supporting person with the lower 
income has “earned income.” For example, if you’re self-employed, 
you might want to forgo some of your discretionary tax deductions 
such as CCA to create more income from which to deduct your 
childcare expenses. As noted earlier, the deduction for childcare 
expenses cannot exceed two-thirds of earned income. So, for a 
maximum claim, the earned income of the lower-net-income sup-
porting person needs to be three-halves (or 150 percent) of the 
eligible childcare costs incurred.
Deducting childcare on the higher-
income parent’s tax return
Can the supporting person with the higher net income ever deduct 
childcare expenses? Yes, if the supporting person with the lower 
net income was in one of these situations:
 
✓ In school (the school can be a secondary school, college, 
university, or an “educational institution” certified by Human 
Resources and Skills Development Canada [HRSDC] for 
courses that develop or improve occupational skills).
 
✓ Not able to take care of children because of a mental or physi-
cal disability
 
✓ In jail for at least two weeks in the year

273
What to do when supporting 
persons live apart
Where supporting persons were living apart for all of the year 
by virtue of a marriage breakdown (whether a legal or common-
law relationship), each is entitled to a deduction for childcare 
expenses. The aggregate claimed by the supporting persons 
cannot exceed the overall limits noted above.
 
If you separated from your spouse in the year and you’re the 
higher-net-income supporting person, you can make a claim if you 
and your spouse were living apart on December 31 of the year. A 
claim will be allowed to you if you and your spouse were separated 
for at least 90 days beginning sometime in the year and the child-
care expenses claimed by you were actually paid by you. The claim 
period is restricted to the period of separation. See Tip #53 for 
more on the special circumstances of a marriage breakdown.

Make the Most of Your 
Family Home
F
or most Canadians, the family home is their most valuable 
asset. So, tax tips relating to the home are relevant to almost 
everyone! In this tip we explore how to purchase, renovate, sell, 
and rent out your home on a tax-friendly basis. You’re sure to find 
a tip or two that can help your family! 
Purchasing a Home Using 
the Home Buyers’ Plan
Normally, withdrawals from your RRSP are fully taxable to you in the 
year of withdrawal. However, when you withdraw money from your 
RRSP to purchase a home under the Home Buyers’ Plan, the with-
drawal is exempt from tax. This can provide a much needed down 
payment for your home and help you to cover closing costs, making 
your RRSP a tax-friendly source of funds for a home purchase.
Of course, your tax obligations aren’t over. You’re required to 
repay the amount you withdrew for your Home Buyers’ Plan to 
your RRSP. If you don’t? You guessed it — the shortfall will be 
added to your income (at line 129 of your tax return). 
As with anything tax-related, rules to the game apply. First, you 
can withdraw up to $25,000 from your RRSP tax-free to buy a home, 
as long as you or your spouse hasn’t owned a home that you occu-
pied as your principal place of residence in the past four years. 
Your spouse can make use of the HBP too, leaving a potential for 
$50,000 to go toward the home purchase, provided your spouse 
also hasn’t owned a home in the past four years and you are pur-
chasing the home jointly.
The withdrawal is treated as a loan from your RRSP, to be repaid 
over a period of no more than 15 years. The first repayment, a min-
imum of one-fifteenth of your HBP withdrawal, must be paid back 
in the second calendar year following the year in which you made 
the withdrawal. If you took out a $40,000 HBP loan in November 

275
 #55: Make the Most of Your Family Home
2009, for example, you must repay at least $1,333 (one-fifteenth of 
$20,000) before the end of 2011. If you don’t make the repayment, 
the $1,333 is included in your income. Yikes!
 
It’s easy to make an HBP repayment — you simply make a contri-
bution to your RRSP. On schedule 7 of your tax return, you note 
the total of your RRSP contributions and then allocate a portion 
of the contributions to the annual HBP repayment. (That amount 
doesn’t qualify for an RRSP deduction because it’s simply a repay-
ment of an amount borrowed from your RRSP.)
 
If you contribute to your RRSP and then withdraw the funds within 
90 days for the HBP, you won’t be able to claim a deduction for 
that contribution. Always allow your contributions to sit for 91 
days or more before making a withdrawal under the HBP.
No restriction on speeding up your HBP repayment exists. It makes 
good financial sense to repay the withdrawals as soon as you can, 
because the sooner the funds go back into your RRSP, the greater 
the tax-free growth in value!
Limited time offer: Home 
renovation tax credit
For 2009, the Canadian government offered a tax credit worth up to $1,350 for eli-
gible home renovations. The credit applies to eligible expenses of more than $1,000 
and you receive the maximum credit with reno costs of $10,000. To qualify, the reno 
costs must be incurred after January 27, 2009 and before February 1, 2010. 
The home renovation tax credit (HRTC) applies to a wide range of projects in your 
home. The key is that the work done must be “of an enduring nature and integral to 
the dwelling.” The cost of supplies and materials, labour, and professional services 
can all be included. Financing costs cannot, nor can general home maintenance 
costs such as snow removal or house cleaning.
Some examples of eligible improvements include:
 ✓ Renovating a kitchen, bathroom, basement, or other room in your home
 ✓ Landscaping
 ✓ Installing new flooring
 ✓ Painting
 ✓ Replacing your roof
 ✓ Replacing windows or doors

Part IV:  Tips for Families  
276
Getting into the ecoENERGY Grant
If you’re planning to renovate your home and the reno will improve 
your home’s energy efficiency, be aware that a grant of up to 
$5,000 could be available to you from the federal government. 
Some provincial governments top up the grant. This is free money 
to help with costs you were going to incur anyway, so it’s definitely 
worth a look!
The first step is to hire an energy advisor certified by Natural 
Resources Canada who will evaluate your home’s current energy 
effectiveness. You can find an advisor at the following Web site: 
http://oee.nrcan.gc.ca/residential/personal/new-
home-improvement/contact-advisors.cfm?attr=4. You’ll 
receive a report outlining the grant you will receive by making spe-
cific improvements to your home. Some examples might include 
replacing your home’s furnace, air conditioning or water heating 
system, or installing energy-efficient windows. 
This grant is not claimed on your tax return; however, it’s pos-
sible you could claim the 2009 home renovation tax credit and the 
ecoENERGY grant on the same expenditures. This program is set 
to end on March 31, 2011.
Selling Your Family Home Tax-Free
One of the last great tax shelters in Canada is the ability to sell 
your principal residence, a fancy name for your family home, 
without having to pay tax on the gains. If you own only one family 
residence, you have nothing to worry about. You can safely sell 
your home and not have to claim the gain on your tax return. Easy 
peasy.
If you own more than one property that could be considered your 
principal residence, you’ll eventually have to pay tax on the gains 
on one property. This is most often seen where you have a home 
and a vacation property like a cottage or ski chalet. In that case 
you can usually choose which property to designate as your princi-
pal residence so that you can avoid the capital gains tax on one of 
the properties. See Tip #46 for all the details.

277
Tips When Renting Out 
Your Own Residence
Do you rent out space in your home? If so, the income you earn is 
taxable and must be reported on form T776 when you file your tax 
return. Thankfully it doesn’t end there. You’re allowed to claim a 
portion of your expenses to help offset that income and lower your 
tax bill. We talk about real estate rentals in Tip #44. The only differ-
ence between renting out a space that you live in, versus a space 
that you don’t, is that not all of your expenses are deductible. 
 
You have to split your expenses so that you’re not deducting 
any personal expenses on your tax return. If you have expenses 
that relate only to the rented space, such as advertising costs to 
get a new tenant or repairs and maintenance of the space, those 
expenses are fully deductible. Any expenses that related to the 
property on a whole such as mortgage interest, property taxes, or 
utilities must be divided between the personal part and the rented 
part. 
The method you use to split the expenses must be reasonable. 
Generally, the CRA will allow you to split the expenses if you use 
the square footage of the rented space divided by the square foot-
age of the entire space, or the number of rented rooms divided by 
the total number of rooms in the house. Some rooms may be used 
by you and the tenant. In that case you need to use a reasonable 
method to allocate the expenses, such as estimating the percent-
age of time the tenant uses those shared rooms.
 
We don’t recommend you claim capital cost allowance on your 
home. If you do, you’ll lose a portion of the principal residence 
exemption when you eventually sell your home. And because real 
estate usually goes up in value, that exemption may be worth more 
than a small deduction each year.
 
Avoid claiming a loss on the rental of your home, or other person-
ally used property. If you do, a “reasonable expectation of profit” 
rule could be applied that will prevent you from claiming expenses 
against your rental income.

Claim Credit for Tuition 
and Textbooks
I
n this tip we tell you how claim the 15 percent non-refundable 
federal tax credit — for eligible tuition, education, and textbook 
costs and any unused amounts you weren’t able to use that are 
carried forward from previous years. If you can’t use it you may be 
able to share the credit with a family member.
 
Amounts carried forward are shown on your Notice of Assessment. 
Enter the details of your tuition and education amounts on sched-
ule 11 of your return.
 Qualifying courses include the majority of those at the post-
secondary level or those that develop or improve skills in an 
occupation. You must also have paid more than $100 during the 
year to each educational institution whose fees you claim. You 
can’t claim other expenses related to pursuing your education, 
such as board and lodging. These costs are the reason why an 
education amount is available to students.
You can claim the tuition you paid for courses you took in the cur-
rent year. If you missed claiming tuition you paid for in previous 
years you will need to file a T1 Adjustment (to correct that year’s 
tax return) in order to claim the credit.
Making the Claim
You can claim the education tax credit for each whole or part 
month in the year in which you were enrolled in a qualifying edu-
cational program. Your educational institution has to complete 
and give you form T2202, “Education and Textbook Amounts 
Certificate,” or form T2202A, “Tuition, Education and Textbook 
Amounts Certificate,” to confirm the period in which you were 
enrolled in a qualifying program.
To claim tuition fees paid to an educational institution outside 
Canada, you must receive from your institution a completed form 
TL11A, “Tuition, Education and Textbook Amounts Certificate — 
University Outside Canada.”

279
 #56: Claim Credit for Tuition and Textbooks
Currently, you can claim $400 for each month in which you were 
enrolled as a full-time student, or $120 for each month in which 
you were enrolled in a qualifying part-time program. You cannot 
claim more than one education amount for a particular month.
 
A full-time program is a program at the post-secondary level that 
lasts at least three weeks and requires at least ten hours per week 
on courses or work in the program. A part-time program must also 
last at least three weeks, but it does not have a ten-hour-per-week 
course or workload requirement.
You can claim $400 a month if you attended your educational insti-
tution only part time because of a mental or physical impairment. 
In this case, you have to complete part 2 of form T2202, “Education 
and Textbook Amounts Certificate,” to make your claim.
Offsetting the Cost of Textbooks
In addition to receiving some tax relief through the tuition and edu-
cation credit amounts, students can also claim a non-refundable 
credit amount to offset the cost of their textbooks. The credit 
amount is calculated as follows: $65 for each month for which you 
qualify for the full-time education tax credit amount; or $20 for 
each month for which you qualify for the part-time education tax 
credit amount.
Transferring or Carrying Forward 
Credit Amounts
In many cases, students simply do not have the cash flow to pay 
for their own education. However, for tax purposes, the student — 
not the person who paid the fees — gets first crack at the tuition, 
education, and textbook tax credit amounts. It’s only when you 
don’t need the full tax credit from these amounts to reduce your 
tax bill to zero that you can transfer the tuition, education, and 
textbook tax credit amounts to another person.
 
If you don’t need all the tuition, education, and textbook tax 
credit amounts to reduce your taxes to zero, you can transfer 
some or all of your unused credits to another person. If you don’t 
transfer your unused amount to your spouse, you can transfer it 
to your or your spouse’s parent or grandparent, who would claim 
it on line 324 of his or her return. Complete the back of form 
T2202 or form T2202A, as well as schedule 11 on your tax return, 

Part IV:  Tips for Families  
280
to calculate and designate this transfer. The maximum amount 
you may transfer to a spouse, parent, or grandparent is $5,000 
(for federal tax purposes). 
 
If you’re transferring a tuition, education, or textbook tax credit 
amount to another person, don’t transfer more than the person 
needs to reduce his or her federal income tax to zero. That way, 
you maximize the benefit of the credit and can carry forward the 
unused amount to a future year to offset your future tax bill.
You can carry forward the part of your tuition, education, and 
textbook tax credit amounts that you did not need to use and did 
not transfer for the year in which they were incurred. However, if 
you carry forward an amount, you won’t be able to transfer it to 
anyone else in the future. 
You must claim your carryforward amount in the earliest year 
possible — when you have a federal tax liability that needs to be 
sheltered with a federal tax credit. You can’t pick and choose the 
tax years in which to claim the credits. The federal carryforward 
amount and the amount, if any, used in the year to reduce a tax bill 
are to be detailed on schedule 11 of your tax return.
Receiving a Transfer of Credits
A student who does not need tuition, education, and textbook tax 
credit amounts to reduce federal income tax to zero may be able 
to transfer the unused portion to you if you are a parent or grand-
parent of the student or of the student’s spouse. The maximum 
amount that each student can transfer is $5,000 (for federal tax 
purposes) minus the amount the student needs, even if an unused 
amount greater than this still exists. 
To calculate the transfer amount and to highlight to whom the 
amount is being transferred, the student has to complete the 
reverse side of form T2202, “Education and Textbook Amounts 
Certificate,” or form T2202A, “Tuition, Education and Textbook 
Amounts Certificate.” 
 
If a student’s spouse claims amounts on line 303 (spousal or com-
mon-law partner amount) or 326 (amounts transferred for spouse) 
for the student, a parent or grandparent cannot claim the tuition 
and education amounts transfer.

Know What Education 
Income Is Tax-Free
P
ost-secondary education is increasingly expensive, and 
you’ve got to pay for it somehow. Sadly, any income you 
receive at that summer job slinging fries is taxable, but the CRA 
doesn’t tax every cent you put toward your education. In this tip, 
we look at some education income that isn’t taxable, and consider 
income that you might not expect to be taxable.
Scholarships, Bursaries, and 
Fellowships: Tax-free
All scholarship, bursary, and fellowship income you receive is not 
taxable when that income is received in connection with a pro-
gram for which you will get an education tax credit. (See “Claiming 
Credit for Tuition”) for details on who is eligible for an education 
tax credit.
If you’re not eligible to claim the education amount, then only 
the first $500 of the award is tax free. Sadly, you need to report 
amounts you receive in excess of $500 on line 130 of your tax 
return.
Elementary and secondary school scholarships and bursaries are 
not taxable and are not subject to the requirement that they be eli-
gible for the education amount.
Research Grants and Education 
Assistance Payments: Taxable
Unfortunately, not all income you receive for education is non-
taxable. In this section, we cover two taxable sources of income 
that might surprise you. 

Part IV:  Tips for Families  
282
Research grants
Research grants are taxable, but you can deduct any expenses 
you incurred to conduct research against them. Eligible expenses 
include the following:
 
✓ Travelling expenses, including all amounts for meals and 
lodging while away from home in the course of your research 
work;
 
✓ Fees paid to assistants; and
 
✓ The cost of equipment, and laboratory fees and charges.
You can’t deduct personal and living expenses (including your pet 
goldfish’s food, even though you would never have survived those 
long nights in the lab without her) or amounts for which you have 
been reimbursed.
Report only the net amount of your grant income on line 104 of 
your return. To calculate your net income, subtract your expenses 
from the grant you received. Your expenses cannot be more than 
your grant. 
 
You’re allowed to deduct only research expenses you paid for in 
the same year that you receive the research grant. You may incur 
research expenses before or after the year in which the grant 
is received in certain circumstances. CRA will consider those 
expenses to be deductible in the year the grant is received as long 
as you’ve been notified the grant is payable and they are paid 
within one year before or after the grant is received.
Education assistance payments
Also taxable are income amounts earned in a registered education 
savings plan (RESP), called educational assistance payments (EAPs). 
If you’re the beneficiary of an RESP you need to include the EAPs 
in your income for the year you receive them. Don’t include the 
original contributions you made to an RESP in your income when 
they are returned to you — you’ve already paid tax on this money. 
Taxable payments from an RESP are shown in box 40 or box 42 of 
your T4A slip. See Tip #51 for more details on RESPs.

Study the Other Deductions 
and Credits Available 
to Students
W
e know that being a student may not be the most glamor-
ous or lucrative time of your life (let’s hear it for mac and 
cheese, folks!), and fortunately, the CRA does, too. That’s why, in 
addition to the tuition and textbook credits we cover in Tip #56, 
the CRA offers additional deductions and credits just for students, 
which we cover here.
Deduct Your Student 
Moving Expenses
If you relocated during the course of the year, either to work a 
summer job or to take up full-time attendance at your college or 
university, it’s possible you can deduct your moving expenses.
Your moving expenses are deductible if your residence is at least 
40 kilometres closer to your new workplace or school than your 
old residence was. However, they can be deducted only against 
either employment income at your new location or, when you’re 
moving to go to school, against taxable award income such as 
research grants. 
Moving-expense deductions are less common for students than 
they used to be. This is because the expenses are deductible only 
against “taxable” income from scholarships, fellowships, research 
grants, and similar awards that are reported on your Canadian tax 
return. Since 2006, most of these types of income are no longer tax-
able. However, when the student is also working (such as moving 

Part IV:  Tips for Families  
284
home to work for the summer), the moving expenses would qualify 
under the general moving expense rules.
If moving expenses can’t be deducted in the year, they can be car-
ried forward to the next year and claimed against employment or 
self-employment earnings in that year.
Student moving expenses would include transportation costs such 
as your train or plane ticket. If you used your car, you can claim 
gas expenses and the cost of any meals and lodging en route. Also 
deductible is the cost of up to 15 days of temporary accommodation 
near your new or old residence. Receipts need not be filed with your 
return, but should be kept in case the CRA asks to see them later.
You’ll need to complete Form T1-M and send it along with your tax 
return in order to make the claim. See Tip #26 for more details on 
claiming moving expenses.
Get More Credit for Your 
Student Loan Interest
You’re eligible for a non-refundable tax credit for your student loan 
interest if your loan was obtained under the Canada Student Loans 
Act, Canada Student Financial Assistance Act, or a similar provincial 
or territorial government law for post-secondary education.
The credit can be claimed only by you, the student, even if the 
interest was paid by another person.
 
You can carry forward your unused interest credits for up to 5 
years. Consider saving your loan interest credit (if you’re in a low 
tax bracket now) to claim against your employment income when 
you finally get that job and you’ll have more money to pay down 
your loan.
 
You cannot claim interest paid on any other kind of loan, or on a 
student loan that has been combined with another kind of loan. So 
even if you will be eligible for a lower interest rate if you renegoti-
ate your student loan with a bank or include it in an arrangement 
to consolidate your loans, the interest on the new loan does not 
qualify for this tax credit. Take this into account when you’re run-
ning the numbers!

Use Your RRSPs for Higher 
Learning: The Lifelong 
Learning Plan
If you or your spouse is considering the possibility of continuing 
your education, or if you’re currently enrolled in an education 
program, you now have an alternate way to finance your studies. 
Great news in times like these!
You can take advantage of the Lifelong Learning Plan as long as you 
or your spouse is enrolled as a full-time student in a qualifying edu-
cation program. You can also participate in the Lifelong Learning 
Plan if you’re disabled and attend school on a part-time basis. 
File a tax return even when you 
have no income to tax
Even if you have no tax to pay this year, filing a tax return is a great idea. It’s the only 
way to receive the following benefits that may be owing to you:
 ✓ GST credit: If you’re 19 or over, you’re eligible for the annual GST/HST credit. 
To obtain this money, which is paid quarterly, you have to apply for it by filing a 
tax return and completing the GST/HST application section of your return. 
 ✓ Provincial tax credits: Some provinces provide tax credits for low-income tax-
payers, which are paid in the form of a tax refund. As a student you probably 
qualify, so check out what’s offered in your province. You may be able to get a 
tax refund even if you never paid any tax!
 ✓ CPP repayment: If you worked last summer and tax was deducted from your 
pay, you can probably recover most of the tax, and some of the CPP premiums, 
when you file your return. If your net income is low enough, you may even be 
able to save your parents or your partner some tax by transferring your unused 
credits to them. 
To maximize savings, take advantage of as many deductions and credits as you 
can, and don’t waste any that are available. Tuition fees, the education amount, 
and the textbook tax credit that you don’t need this year can be transferred or car-
ried forward so that you can use them in a future year when your income is higher.

Give me the money
The Lifelong Learning Plan allows you to withdraw up to $20,000 
(the annual limit is $10,000) tax-free from your RRSPs to assist you 
or your spouse with education expenses. Subject to certain restric-
tions, amounts may be withdrawn as often as needed over a period 
of up to 4 years, and repaid over a period of no more than 10 years.
The Lifelong Learning Plan is similar to the Home Buyers’ Plan in 
that you must make sure not to withdraw any of the RRSP contri-
butions you made in the immediately preceding 90 days, otherwise 
you won’t be allowed to deduct them on your return. You can 
avoid this by not making your withdrawal from the same RRSP to 
which you contributed in the immediately preceding 90 days, or, 
alternatively, by making sure the balance in the RRSP immediately 
after the withdrawal is greater than the total contributions made 
during the preceding 90 days.
Payback time
Generally, you need to repay 1/10th of your original Lifelong 
Learning Plan balance until you repay the full amount you 
withdrew. 
The timing of when you need to start making those repayments 
depends on your status as a student. If you’re entitled to the edu-
cation amount as a full-time student for at least three months in a 
year, you don’t need to start making repayments. If you don’t meet 
this education amount condition two years in a row, your ten-year 
repayment period begins in the second of the two years.
 
Attention perpetual students! If you continue to meet the three-
month condition every year, your repayment period will start in 
the fifth year after your first LLP withdrawal. Sorry guys — you 
can’t put off repayment forever!
Sometime when a program is a short one and you begin it near the 
end of a year you may not be entitled to the education amount for 
three months in any year. When this happens, your first repayment 
year is the second year after the year of your LLP withdrawal.

Tips for Special Tax 
Planning 
Circumstances

In this part . . .
“D
eductions and credits” — always good words to 
a taxpayer!  Many taxpayers in special circum-
stances (say, those incurring signifi cant medical expenses, 
being disabled or supporting someone who is or, simply, 
being a senior and receiving pension income) could use a 
few more dollars to assist with living expenses.  The tax 
rules acknowledge special needs and circumstances and 
work to offer taxpayers a number of tax breaks that we 
discuss in the this part. Take these breaks when they’re 
available — the CRA won’t remind you to claim them!
Sadly, it’s not all deductions and credits in this part. If 
you’re a U.S. citizen or Canadian and own U.S. property, 
the Internal Revenue Services (IRS) of the U.S. has an inter-
est in you for both U.S. income taxes while you are alive 
and U.S. estate taxes on your death. (And you thought 
Canadian taxes were hard enough!)
Finally, as the saying goes, “death” and “taxes” go 
together.  Unless you have found the fountain of youth or 
are somehow immortal you cannot cheat death.  However, 
you can take advantage of some tax tips on to minimize 
the income tax arising on death.  (Unfortunately, we can’t 
say “cheat tax” because that would get us into trouble.) 
The lower the tax the greater the funds available to your 
heirs!  They will thank you for undertaking some of the 
income, estate and probate planning tips we recommend 
in this part.

Make the Most of Your 
Medical Expenses
B
eing ill can be quite unsettling (to say the least), and it can 
be costly to keep up with health care and prescriptions. The 
good news is that our tax rules provide some small saving grace in 
that eligible medical expenses can provide a tax break for you.
Restrictions apply on the amount of medical expenses that can be 
claimed, but you have some flexibility in choosing the period in 
which you claim them. (Hint: It doesn’t need to be a calendar year.) 
You also have some options on who actually claims your medical 
expenses.
Claim a Tax Credit for 
Medical Expenses
First, the restrictions. You can claim only the total of eligible medi-
cal expenses you have incurred that exceeds the lesser of 3 per-
cent of your net income (line 236 of your tax return), and $2,011.
So, if your medical expenses do not exceed the greater of 3 percent 
of your net income and $2,011, then you’re not entitled to claim 
your medical expenses and your tax credit is, therefore, zero. (It 
may also mean you’re pretty healthy, or you have really good 
medical insurance coverage!) As we discuss later in this tip, you 
may be able to claim the medical expenses on the following year’s 
tax return or perhaps it’s best, in terms of family tax minimization, 
if your spouse/common-law partner claims your medical expenses.
 
If you do the math you will see that the $2,011 threshold is reached 
when a taxpayer has a net income of $67,033 or greater.

Part V: Tips for Special Tax Planning Circumstances  
290
Choose the Best Period to Claim 
Medical Expenses
 
You’d think the tax rules would state that if you incurred a medical 
expense in, say, 2008, it could be claimed only on a 2008 tax return. 
However, that’s not the case. In an example below we show how a 
2008 medical expense can be claimed on a 2009 tax return — and 
the result is “taxpayer friendly!”
The income tax rules let you pick the best “medical expense year” 
or 12-month period so you can maximize the tax savings from 
medical expenses. In going “non-calendar,” you’re able to pick the 
period when you incurred the highest medical expenses and there-
fore minimize the impact of the “3 percent of net income/$2,011” 
restriction noted above that serves to reduce the tax saving.
12-month period
In reporting your medical expenses on your 2009 return you can 
gather your expenses for any 12-month period that ends in 2009.
Say you incurred $1,500 of eligible medical expenses in December 
2008 and this was the total of your 2008 medical expenses. You did 
not claim the $1,500 of medical expenses on your 2008 return — 
you knew the tax savings would be zero because the amount was 
below the 2008 threshold.
The $1,500 of medical expenses in 2008 would have been “wasted” 
(in terms of tax savings) were there not the possibly of choosing a 
“non-calendar” period when completing your 2009 tax return.
Continuing the example, let’s say you incurred $2,000 in medical 
expenses in November 2009. Also assume that for 2009 your net 
income was $67,033 (or above), so your medical expenses had to 
exceed $2,011 for you to receive any tax savings. If in 2009 you 
chose the calendar year to report your $2,000 in medical expenses, 
your tax savings would, as in 2008, be zero.
Now for the better way! In preparing your 2009 return, choose the 
12-month period of December 1, 2008 to November 30, 2009 to 
report your medical expenses. Then, the total reported is $3,500 — 
which is reduced by your threshold of $2,011 to leave $1,489 
available for a tax credit. At 15 percent, your federal tax savings is 
$223 — plus you’re also entitled to provincial/territorial tax sav-
ings. Not a bad result for simply “going non-calendar” with your 
medical expenses.

 # 59: Make the Most of Your Medical Expenses
24-month period
In the year of death an individual can claim any previously 
unclaimed medical expenses for a 24-month period that includes 
the date of death. This permits medical expenses that may have 
been paid after the date of death to be claimed on the individual’s 
final personal tax return.
Choose the Best Person to 
Claim Medical Expenses
In preparing your tax return you’re allowed to claim medical 
expenses you paid for yourself and for your spouse/common-law 
partner. You can also claim medical expenses paid for by your 
spouse/common-law partner or vice versa.. Essentially, all medical 
expenses can be claimed on your tax return or on the tax return of 
your spouse/common-law partner regardless of which one of you 
paid or who the expense was for. This flexibility brings good news! 
(Tip #60 explains how you can claim medical expenses incurred for 
other family members as well.) 
 
Because the total of medical expenses available for tax credit is 
reduced by the lesser of “3 percent of net income or $2,011,” it’s 
usually best that the spouse/common-law partner with the lowest 
net income claims the medical expenses to maximize the tax sav-
ings available to the family. Where both you and your spouse/
common-law partner have a net income of $67,033 or above, the 
tax savings from the medical expenses will be the same — you 
both will be subject to the restriction that only medical expenses 
in excess of $2,011 are eligible for a tax credit.
Understand What Medical 
Expenses Are Eligible
Eligible medical expense include 
 
✓ Fees for professional medical services: These include 
the services of doctors, dentists, surgeons, chiropractors, 
acupuncturists, nurses, physiotherapists, speech language 
pathologists or audiologists, naturopaths, or professional 
tutors that a medical practitioner certifies as necessary 
because of a person’s learning disability or mental 
impairment.

Part V: Tips for Special Tax Planning Circumstances  
292
 
✓ Payments for apparatus and materials, and repairs thereto: 
Eligible apparatus and materials include artificial limbs, 
wheelchairs, crutches, hearing aids, prescription eyeglasses 
or contact lenses, dentures, pacemakers, orthopedic shoes, 
reasonable expenses relating to renovations or alterations 
to a dwelling of an impaired person, reasonable moving 
expenses if incurred by an impaired person moving to a more 
accessible dwelling, and so on.
 
✓ Medicines: These include costs of prescription drugs, vac-
cines, insulin, oxygen, and so on.
 
✓ Fees for medical treatments: These treatments include blood 
transfusions, injections, pre- and postnatal treatments, psy-
chotherapy, speech pathology or audiology, and so on.
 
✓ Fees for laboratory examinations and tests: These include 
blood tests, cardiographs, X-ray examinations, urine and stool 
analyses, and so on.
 
✓ Fees for hospital services: These include hospital bills, use of 
the operating room, anaesthetist, X-ray technician, and so on.
 
✓ Amounts paid for attendant care and care in a retirement or 
nursing home: Seniors eligible to claim the disability amount 
tax credit (Tip #61 and Tip #62) can claim the cost of care in 
a retirement or nursing home. When in a retirement home the 
claim is limited to $10,000 per year or $20,000 in the year of 
death. If more than these amounts are claimed the disability 
amount tax credit cannot be claimed. If the senior is in a nurs-
ing home the cost of the care can be claimed as a medical 
expense but the individual cannot claim the disability amount 
tax credit.
 
✓ Ambulance charges
 
✓ Expenses for guide and hearing-ear animals
 
✓ Premiums paid to private health services plans including 
travel medical insurance.
 
✓ Travel expenses, if medical treatment is not available locally.
 
✓ Services such as real-time captioning for individuals with a 
speech or hearing impairment, note-taking services for indi-
viduals with mental or physical impairments, and reading 
services for the blind.
 
✓ Marijuana, under restricted circumstances.

293
 # 59: Make the Most of Your Medical Expenses
Understand What You Cannot 
Claim as Medical Expenses
Things you cannot claim as medical expenses include 
 
✓ Toothpaste; 
 
✓ Maternity clothes; 
 
✓ Athletic club memberships; 
 
✓ Funeral, cremation, or burial expenses; 
 
✓ Illegal operations, treatments, procured drugs, and so on.
Similarly, you’re not allowed to claim any vitamins, herbs, bottled 
water, or organic or natural foods, even when prescribed by a 
licensed medical practitioner, if those items are not “recorded by 
a pharmacist.” In other words, only prescription drugs that you 
must buy from a pharmacist qualify.
Take Advantage of the Refundable 
Medical Expense Supplement
The refundable medical expense supplement provides monetary 
assistance of $1,067 (in 2009) to lower-income taxpayers who incur 
significant medical- or disability-related expenses (see Tip #61). 
To receive the supplement the taxpayer’s employment and/or self-
employment income must be at least $3,116. The supplement is 
calculated as the lower of $1,067 and 25 percent of the aggregate 
of the medical expenses and the disability supports deduction 
claimed. The available supplement is reduced where family income 
(both spouses’/common-law partners’ incomes together) exceeds 
$23,363. The reduction is 5 percent on every dollar of family 
income over $23,363. At a family income of $44,703 or above, the 
supplement works out to zero.

Claim All the Medical 
Expenses of Your Family
B
eing sick is no fun. Having sick family members is no fun. 
However, if a bright side exists, it’s that in addition to medi-
cal expenses you pay for yourself you can also include the medical 
expenses paid for your family members in calculating your tax 
savings.
Determine Total Medical Expenses 
for You and Your Family
The medical expenses eligible for you (or your spouse/common-
law partner) to claim in preparing your tax return include medi-
cal expenses paid by you or your spouse/common-law partner in 
regard to:
 
✓ You and your spouse/common-law partner
 
✓ Your children and grandchildren and the children and grand-
children of your spouse/common-law partner
 
✓ Other individuals’ children who were under 18 at the end of 
the year who depended on you or your spouse/common-law 
partner for support, and
 
✓ Your parents, grandparents, brothers, sisters, uncles, aunts, 
nieces, and nephews who depended on you for support.
Medical Expenses of Children
The amount of medical expenses eligible to claim on a parent’s, 
grandparent’s, or supporting person’s tax return depends on the 
child’s age at the end of the year.

295
 # 60: Claim All the Medical Expenses of Your Family
Children under 18 
No income restriction applies on the amounts claimed for medical 
expenses of each child under 18 at the end of the year. In other 
words, the income of the child dependant does not factor into the 
amount of the child’s medical expenses that can be claimed.
The parent, grandparent, or supporting person claiming the medi-
cal expenses is still restricted to the overall limits highlighted in 
Tip #59. The total amount of medical expenses you (or your spouse/
common-law partner) may claim needs to exceed the greater of 3 
percent of your “line 236” net income (or spouse/common-law 
partner’s net income if he or she is claiming the medical expenses) 
and $2,011.
Claiming medical expenses of your 
children or grandchildren 18 or older 
Where you (or perhaps your spouse/common-law partner) are 
claiming medical expenses regarding your own child or grandchild 
who is 18 or older at the end of the year the amount of medical 
expenses eligible to be claimed is reduced by the lesser of
 
✓ 3 percent of the child’s or grandchild’s net income (line 236 
on his or her 2009 tax return), and
 
✓ $2,011.
A separate calculation needs to be done for each child or grand-
child for whom medical expenses are being claimed.
Even when after the above reduction the medical expenses eli-
gible to claim are greater than $10,000, the maximum that can be 
included in your (or your spouse’s/common-law partner’s) tax 
return is $10,000 of medical expenses per child or grandchild 
18 or older.
 
After the 18-year-old-or-older child or grandchild’s medical 
expenses are reduced by the “3 percent of net income/$2,011” 
restrictions noted above, the restrictions are NOT again applied 
in calculating the overall amount the parent or grandparent may 
claim regarding themselves and other dependants.

Part V: Tips for Special Tax Planning Circumstances  
296
Restrictions in claiming medical 
expenses of other dependants 
 18 and over
In claiming medical expenses of other dependants (that is, not 
your spouse/common-law partner, children, or grandchildren), 
three restrictions apply. The first two restrictions are identical to 
the restrictions noted above related to medical expenses being 
claimed regarding children or grandchildren who are 18 years of 
age or older at the end of the year.
The first restriction is that the amount of medical expenses for 
each dependant relative to be claimed are reduced by the lesser of 
 
✓ 3 percent of the dependant’s net income, and
 
✓ $2,011.
The second restriction is that the maximum medical expenses of 
the dependant you can claim on your (or your spouse/common-
law partner’s) tax return is $10,000.
Finally, the third restriction is that for you (or your spouse/common-
law partner) to claim the dependant’s medical expenses, the 
dependant must have lived in Canada at some time in the year.
Support your medical expense claim
Attach your receipts and other documents to your tax return if you’re paper-filing. If 
you file electronically, keep your receipts, as the CRA often asks to see them before 
they assess your return. If you have a significant amount of medical expenses we 
recommend paper-filing your return to avoid delays in the assessing of your tax 
return.
Receipts for attendant care or therapy paid to an individual need to note the indi-
vidual’s name and social insurance number.

Claim the Disability Tax 
Credit Amount and Disability 
Supports Deduction
T
he income tax rules offer disabled individuals some tax sav-
ings to leave a few extra dollars around to assist with the addi-
tional medical-, school-, and work-related costs incurred as a result 
of the disability.
The most well known tax saving provisions available to a disabled 
individual are the disability tax credit and, when the disabled indi-
vidual is under 18, the additional disability supplement. We look at 
these in this tip and also cover the less well known “disability sup-
ports deduction.” 
In Tip #62 we comment on how an individual can claim a disability 
tax credit regarding a spouse/common-law partner, child, or other 
dependant’s disability. In Tip #63 we discuss the new saving and 
tax planning idea of registered disability savings plans, or RDSPs.
Claim the Disability 
Tax Credit Amount
You may be able to claim the disability credit amount of $7,196 
(for 2009) on schedule 1 of your tax return, resulting in a federal 
income tax savings of $1,079 (15 percent). Provincial/territorial 
income tax savings are also available.
Examining eligibility criteria
To claim the disability tax credit amount, you must have a qualified 
practitioner (such as a medical doctor, optometrist, psychologist, 

Part V: Tips for Special Tax Planning Circumstances  
298
occupational therapist, audiologist, speech-language pathologist, 
or physiotherapist) certify the following:
 
✓ You had a severe impairment in mental or physical functions 
which caused you to be blind or markedly restricted all or 
almost all the time in a basic activity of daily living or subject 
to life-sustaining therapy.
 
 You may be markedly restricted in a basic activity of daily living 
if you’re blind or are unable to feed or dress yourself, control 
bowel and bladder functions, walk, speak, hear, or lack the 
mental functions for everyday life (perceive, think, or remem-
ber). You may also be markedly restricted if it takes you an 
extremely long time to perform any of these basic activities 
of daily living, even with therapy and the use of appropriate 
aides and medication.
 
 Examples of life-sustaining therapy include 
 
• Chest physiotherapy to facilitate breathing (used in the 
treatment of cystic fibrosis)
 
• Kidney dialysis to filter blood
 
• Insulin therapy to treat Type 1 diabetes in a child who 
cannot adjust the insulin dosage
 
✓ Your impairment was prolonged — meaning it lasted, or 
is expected to last, for a continuous period of at least 12 
months.
Getting certification
Certification of your disability by a qualified practitioner needs 
to be documented on CRA form T2201, “Disability Tax Credit 
Certificate.” If you’re claiming the disability credit amount for the 
first time, you have to submit the form T2201 with your tax return. 
The CRA will review your claim to determine whether you qualify 
before it assesses your return. Once approved, you’ll be able to 
claim this amount for future years as long as your circumstances 
do not change. 
 
If you’ve filed the form in a previous year you needn’t file it again. 
The CRA may contact you every few years to request an updated 
certified form T2201.

299
 #61: Claim Disability Tax Credit and Deduction
Claiming the disability tax credit 
versus claiming the cost of attendant 
care as a medical expense
A riddle? No, not really — perhaps just a number-crunching exercise!
If you require attendant care, restrictions apply in claiming this 
cost as a medical expense and also claiming the disability tax credit. 
Should you claim greater than $10,000 as a medical expense for the 
cost of your care, your disability tax credit will not be permitted.
 
Depending on the cost of your full-time attendant care it may be 
beneficial, in terms of tax savings, to forgo claiming your disabil-
ity tax credit and claim the cost of your full-time care as a medi-
cal expense. Because the disability tax credit amount for 2009 is 
$7,196, if your attendant care expenses exceed $17,196 it may be 
best to claim the costs of the care and forget about the disability 
tax credit. (Warning: In this statement we ignored the “3 percent of 
net income or $2,011” restriction in calculating medical expenses 
that qualify for a tax credit, which we discuss in Tip #59.)
Alternatively, it may be best to restrict your claim for care to 
$10,000 and claim the disability tax credit. Decisions, decisions.
Claim the Disability Tax Credit 
Supplement If Under 18
In addition to the disability tax credit amount, if you were under 18 
at the end of the year and qualified for the disability tax credit, you 
can claim to an additional credit amount of $4,198 (2009 amount).
The maximum credit amount claim of $4,198 is reduced under the 
following circumstances: 
 
✓ Another individual — say, a parent — claimed childcare 
expenses (Tip #54) or attendant care expenses (as a medical 
expense; Tip #59) on their tax return regarding you
 
✓ You included attendant care expenses as part of your “disabil-
ity supports deduction” claim (discussed below) or as part of 
medical expenses you personally claimed (Tip #59)

Part V: Tips for Special Tax Planning Circumstances  
300
 
If you’re able to claim the disability tax credit amount of $7,196 
and the full $4,198 disability supplement, it’s the total of these 
amounts — $11,394 — that you enter on line 316 of schedule 1 of 
your tax return. The income tax savings on this amount is $1,709 
(15 percent) of federal income tax plus the respective provincial or 
territorial income tax.
Claim the Disability Supports 
Tax Deduction
If you have a severe and prolonged mental or physical impair-
ment, you’re able to deduct the cost of an attendant and other 
expenses you incur for the purpose of going to school or work 
(employment or self-employment). Complete form T929, “Disability 
Supports Deduction,” and claim your deduction on line 215 of 
your tax return. The form is available on the CRA Web site 
(www.cra.gc.ca/forms).
Eligible expenses
To qualify for attendant care expenses your attendant must be over 
the age of 18 and cannot be your spouse/common-law partner.
 
Amounts reimbursed by a non-taxable payment, such as insurance, 
are not eligible for the disability supports deduction. Also, you 
can’t claim any expense you’ve claimed as a medical expense 
(Tip #59). No double-dipping!
In addition to attendant care, eligible expenses include Braille 
note-takers and printers, electronic speech synthesizers, optical 
scanners, page turning devices, reading services, real-time caption-
ing services or sign-language interpretation services, talking text-
books and teletypewriters.
Restrictions on expenses
Of course, a limit is placed on the amount of expenses you can 
deduct. For going to work, it’s the lesser of 
 
✓ Your “earned income” for the year, and
 
✓ The qualified expenses you paid for during the year.

301
 #61: Claim Disability Tax Credit and Deduction.
For purposes of the disability supports deduction, earned income 
includes your employment income, net self-employed income, tax-
able amount of scholarships, net research grants, and amounts 
received from the federal government to encourage employment.
If the disability support expenses are required for you to attend 
secondary school or a designated educational institution, the limit 
is the least of the following:
 
✓ Your income from other sources (up to a maximum of 
$15,000)
 
✓ $375 multiplied by the number of weeks in attendance
  
✓ The qualified expenses you paid for during the year

Reduce Your Taxes by 
Claiming Tax Credits 
Regarding Another’s 
Disability
I
n this tip we look at the tax rules that let you transfer to your 
tax return a disability tax credit from your spouse/common-law 
partner, child, or other dependant.
Transfer Your Spouse/Common-Law 
Partner’s Disability Credit 
Amount to You
If your spouse/common-law partner is disabled (and is certified as 
such by a qualified practitioner on CRA form T2201, “Disability Tax 
Credit Certificate” — see Tip #61), his or her disability amount can 
be transferred to you to the extent he or she does not need it to 
reduce her income tax bill to zero.
 
In addition to the disability amount, a spouse/common-law partner 
can also transfer the age and the pension credit amounts (Tip #64) 
and the tuition, education, and textbook credit amount (Tip #56).
 
To calculate the credit amounts that can be transferred from your 
spouse/common-law partner, complete schedule 2 of your tax 
return. In the identification area on page 1 of your tax return, be 
sure to report your marital status and your spouse’s/common-law 
partner’s name and social insurance number so your claim is not 
rejected.

303
 #62: Claim Another’s Disability Tax Credits.
Transfer Your Child’s (Or Other 
Dependant’s) Disability Credit 
Amount to You
You may be able to claim all or part of a child’s (or other depen-
dant’s) disability amount that is not needed to reduce the depen-
dant’s taxes — because, say, the dependant’s federal taxes are 
already zero. You can claim the unused portion if he or she lived in 
Canada and was dependant on you because of a mental or physical 
impairment. One of the following must apply: 
 
✓ The dependant was your or your spouse/common-law part-
ner’s child, grandchild, parent, grandparent, brother, or sister 
and lived with you 
 
✓ The dependant was your or your spouse/common-law part-
ner’s child, grandchild, parent, grandparent, brother, sister, 
aunt, uncle, niece, or nephew and 
 
• You made a claim for the caregiver credit amount (see 
below) or the credit amount for an infirm dependant age 
18 or older (see below) for that dependant or
 
• You could have made a claim for the caregiver credit 
amount or the credit amount for an infirm dependant 
age 18 or older, if the dependant had no income and was 
18 years of age or older during the year.
 
Where the dependant is under 18 the disability supplement (Tip 
#61) can be transferred to a supporting individual in addition to 
the disability tax credit amount.
 
If you’re required to make child-support payments for your child, 
you cannot claim a disability amount for that child.
In the first year you claim this amount, you must attach to your 
return a properly completed and certified form T2201, “Disability 
Tax Credit Certificate,” for each dependant.
If you’re splitting this claim for a disability amount transferred 
from a dependant with another supporting person, attach a note to 
your return including the name and social insurance number of the 
other person making this claim. The total claimed for one depen-
dant cannot be more than $7,196, or $11,394 if the full disability 
supplement can be transferred as well.

Part V: Tips for Special Tax Planning Circumstances

If you have a child with a severe and prolonged impairment, you 
may qualify for the Child Disability Benefit (CDB). The CDB is a 
tax-free supplement to the Canada Child Tax Benefit and Children’s 
Special Allowance. Ensure the CRA has form T2201 on file for your 
child and that you file your tax return so the government can 
assess your eligibility for this credit.
Claim Additional Tax Credits 
When You Support Dependants 
Age 18 or Older
In addition to your spouse/common-law partner, child, or other 
dependants being able to transfer their disability tax credit amount 
to you, two other tax credit amounts may be available to you. 
Caregiver Credit Amount
If at any time during the year you maintained a dwelling, alone or 
with another person, where you and a dependant lived, you may 
be able to claim this $4,198 credit amount. The amount is claimed 
on line 315 of schedule 1 of your tax return. A full credit amount of 
$4,198 will provide you with $630 (15 percent) in federal income 
tax savings. The provinces and territories also offer tax savings 
when the caregiver credit amount can be claimed.
To claim this credit amount, your dependant must be one of the 
following:
 
✓ Your or your spouse/common-law partner’s child or 
grandchild
 
✓ Your or your spouse/common-law partner’s brother, sister, 
niece, nephew, aunt, uncle, parent, or grandparent
In addition, the dependant must be
 
✓ Age 18 or over at the time he or she lived with you
 
✓ Dependant on you due to mental or physical impairment, or, 
if he or she is your or your spouse/common-law partner’s 
parent or grandparent, at least 65 years of age.
The details of the claim for a caregiver amount are to be noted 
on schedule 5 of your tax return. The maximum credit amount of 

305
 #62: Reduce Your Taxes by Claiming Tax Credits Regarding . . .
$4,198 is reduced dollar for dollar by the dependant’s income in 
excess of $14,336. When your dependant’s income reaches $18,534, 
the credit amount is reduced to nil.
 
The claim for the caregiver credit amount is different from the 
credit amount for infirm dependants age 18 or older, which we dis-
cuss in the next section. For you to be able to claim the caregiver 
credit amount, the dependant must have lived with you at some 
time during the year. This is not a requirement in claiming the 
credit amount for infirm dependants age 18 and older. Because the 
caregiver credit amount will always be greater than or equal to the 
credit amount for infirm dependants aged 18 or older — because 
of the dependant’s income threshold tests — claim the caregiver 
amount if the dependant lived with you. You cannot claim both 
credit amounts.
If you and another person support the same dependant, you can 
split the claim. However, the total of your claim and the other per-
son’s claim cannot be more than the maximum amount allowed for 
that dependant.
Credit amount for infirm dependants 
age 18 or older
This credit is similar to the caregiver credit amount that we dis-
cuss in the previous section, except that no requirement exists 
that the dependant must have lived with you. As with the caregiver 
credit amount where you can claim the full credit amount of $4,198 
the federal income tax savings will be $630 (15 percent) plus pro-
vincial/territorial tax savings. The credit amount available is to be 
noted on line 306 of schedule 1 of your tax return.
 
You cannot claim both the caregiver credit amount and the credit 
amount for an infirm dependant age 18 or older for the same 
dependant.
To claim a credit amount for an infirm dependant age 18 or older 
the dependant must have been dependant on you, or you and 
others, by reason of physical or mental impairment. 
 
You cannot claim this credit amount if someone other than you 
is claiming the eligible dependant credit amount (line 305) for the 
same dependant. However, if you’re claiming the eligible depen-
dant credit amount, you may also claim the credit amount for 
infirm dependants age 18 or older on line 306. You cannot claim 
the credit amount for infirm dependants age 18 or over if you, or 

Part V: Tips for Special Tax Planning Circumstances  
306
anyone else, have claimed the caregiver credit amount (line 315) 
for the same dependant.
The credit amount available to be claimed is reduced by the 
dependant’s net income in excess of $5,956. The credit is com-
pletely eliminated when the dependant’s net income reaches 
$10,154. Provide the details of the claim for an infirm dependant 
(name, age, net income, nature of infirmity) on schedule 5 of your 
tax return.
 
The dependant’s income thresholds for the infirm dependant age 
18 or older credit are lower than those for the caregiver credit 
amount. So, where the dependant lives with you the caregiver 
credit amount may result in a greater tax reduction.
 
If more than one person is supporting the dependant person, the 
available credit amount must be allocated between those support-
ing people. That is, the total credit amount claimed for one depen-
dant cannot exceed $4,198.
A dependant relative may include your or your spouse/common-
law partner’s child, grandchild, parent, grandparent, brother, 
sister, uncle, aunt, niece, or nephew. To claim this amount the 
dependant must be:
 
✓ Age 18 or older at the end of the year
 
✓ A resident of Canada at some time during the year, if a credit 
amount is being claimed for a dependant other than a child 
or grandchild
 
✓ Dependant on you by reason of mental or physical 
impairment
 
✓ Dependant on you, or you and others, for support
 
Generally, an individual is dependant on you for support if he or 
she does not have income in excess of the basic personal credit 
amount — $10,320 in 2009 — and you have contributed to the 
maintenance of that person (food, shelter, and clothing).
 
You can claim the credit amount for infirm dependants age 18 or 
older in respect to children or grandchildren if they live outside 
Canada provided they depended on you for support. The CRA 
can ask you to provide proof of support paid. Dependants other 
than your children or grandchildren must have been residents in 
Canada at some time during the year.

Make Use of Registered 
Disability Savings 
Plans (RDSPs)
T
hrough the Income Tax Act the government encourages us to 
save for retirement using registered retirement savings plans 
(RRSPs, Tip #42) and for education using registered education sav-
ings plans (RESPs, Tip #51). In that tradition, a plan now exists to 
assist a disabled individual — and parents and other supporters of 
a disabled individual — to save to assist in funding living expenses 
in the later years of a disabled individual’s life. The plan is called a 
registered disability savings plan, or RDSP. In this tip we take a look 
at the plan, explain how you can determine whether you qualify, 
and suggest ways to make the most of it.
Know What an RDSP Is
A registered disability savings plan is a relatively new idea to assist 
in saving for the long-term security of an individual with a disability 
in a tax-efficient manner with additional funds added by the gov-
ernment. Sounds good! Let’s investigate.
RDSPs
Essentially, the plan permits up to $200,000 to be contributed to a 
RDSP on behalf of a disabled individual, the RDSP beneficiary. No 
annual minimum or maximum contribution applies. The deadline 
for contributions each year is December 31.
An RDSP is set up by a plan holder in conjunction with a financial 
institution. The plan holder is usually the disabled individual or a 
parent or guardian if the individual is a minor or not legally 
competent.
Anyone can contribute to the RDSP of a specific individual with 
permission of the plan holder.

Part V: Tips for Special Tax Planning Circumstances  
308
Contributions to an RDSP are not tax deductible. Investment 
income (interest, dividends, and capital gains) earned on invest-
ments held in the RDSP is not subject to tax while the funds remain 
in the plan. When withdrawn, the funds will be subject to tax in the 
RDSP beneficiary’s (the disabled individual’s) hands.
CDSGs and CDSBs
With RDSPs, the federal government has also created two programs:
 
✓ Canada Disability Savings Grant (CDSG): The government 
will match contributions to an RDSP on a 100 percent, 200 per-
cent, or 300 percent basis. The matching percentage depends 
on the amount contributed and the family’s income. The maxi-
mum annual government matching is $3,500.
 
✓ Canada Disability Savings Bond (CDSB): This bond is avail-
able to lower-income families that qualify for the CDSG regard-
less of the amount contributed to the RDSP.
 
To encourage long-term savings, the CDSGs and CDSBs are to 
remain in the RDSP for ten years. If not, they must be repaid to the 
federal government.
Assess Your Eligibility for an RDSP
An individual can be a beneficiary of an RDSP if he or she is
 
✓ Eligible for the disability tax credit (Tip #61)
 
✓ Under the age of 60
 
✓ A resident of Canada when the RDSP is set up
 
✓ The holder of a valid social insurance number (SIN)
Contributions to an RDSP can be made until the end of year in 
which the RDSP beneficiary turns 59.
Make the Most of the CDSG
 
The grant is paid annually. Therefore, rather than making a con-
tribution of all available money upfront to defer the tax on the 
investment income, consider spreading out the contributions over 
a number of years to maximize the grants the federal government 
will add to the RDSP. 

309
 #63: Make Use of Registered Disability Savings Plans (RDSPs)
The grants are paid to the RDSP by the federal government annu-
ally until the beneficiary is 49 years of age. For the grants to con-
tinue the RDSP beneficiary must file annual tax returns or, where 
the beneficiary is under 19, the parents or guardian must file 
annual tax returns.
Understand the amount of the grant
The amount of the grant depends on the amount contributed to 
the RDSP and the beneficiary’s family income.
For the purposes of the CDSG, family income depends on the age of 
the RDSP beneficiary:
 
✓ While the RDSP beneficiary is under 19, the grants are cal-
culated based on the income of the beneficiary’s parents or 
guardian, and
 
✓ When the RDSP beneficiary is 19 or older, the grant is based 
on the beneficiary’s income.
If the beneficiary’s family income is $77,664 or less during the year, 
the maximum grant is $3,500 calculated as follows:
 
✓ For the first $500 contributed the federal government will 
match the contribution on a $3 to $1 basis — 300 percent — 
up to $1,500 a year.
 
✓ On the next $1,000 contributed the matching contribution is 
on a $2 to $1 basis — 200 percent — up to $2,000 a year.
If the beneficiary’s family income is $77,665 or greater, the maxi-
mum grant is $1,000; it’s calculated as one dollar on each dollar 
contributed (100 percent) up to a maximum of $1,000.
The maximum lifetime grant is $70,000. 
Maximize the annual grant
We did the math so you don’t have to! The annual government 
grant to be paid to the RDSP is maximized when
 
✓ You contribute $1,500, if your annual family income is $77,664 
or below 
 
✓ You contribute $1,000, if family income is $77,665 or above

Part V: Tips for Special Tax Planning Circumstances  
310
The Canadian Disability 
Savings Bond (CDSB)
Where the beneficiary’s family income is $21,816 or less during 
the year (refer to the previous section for a definition of family 
income), each year the government will deposit $1,000 to the RDSP 
as CDSB, regardless whether any RDSP contributions are made in 
the year. Where the beneficiary’s family income is between $21,816 
and $38,832, the $1,000 payment is reduced as income increases to 
$38,832. If family income is $38,832 or greater no CDSB is paid.
The maximum lifetime CDSB payment is $20,000 per RDSP benefi-
ciary. The eligibility requirements and the definition of family income 
for the CDSB are the same as those noted above for the CDSG.
RDSP Withdrawals
Two types of withdrawals or payments can be made from an RDSP:
 
✓ Lifetime Disability Assistance Payments (LDAP): These are 
annual payments from an RDSP that are designed to last a 
beneficiary’s lifetime. After they begin they are to continue to 
be paid annually until the beneficiary dies or the plan is ter-
minated. These payments can begin at any age, but must com-
mence no later than the year in which the RDSP beneficiary 
turns 60.
 
 The LDAP has a yearly maximum that is calculated based on 
the value of the RDSP at the beginning of the year of the com-
mencement of annual payments and the life expectancy of the 
RDSP beneficiary (as prescribed by the CRA).
 
✓ Disability Assistance Payment (DAP): These are lump-
sum payments made to the RDSP beneficiary. DAPs may be 
requested when the beneficiary is at least 27. These payments 
are permitted only when the total contributions to the plan 
exceed the CDSGs and CDSBs received.
 
All CDSG and CDSB received from the federal government in the 
previous ten years must be repaid whenever funds are withdrawn 
from an RDSP.

311
 #63: Make Use of Registered Disability Savings Plans (RDSPs)
Payments for an RDSP will not impact the taxpayer’s income-tested 
benefits such as the following: 
 
✓ The Goods and Service Tax/Harmonized Sales Tax (GST/HST) 
credit (Tip #23)
 
✓ The Canada Child Tax Benefit (Tip #52)
 
✓ Old Age Security (OAS) pension (Tip #64)
 
✓ Employment insurance (EI) benefits
All the provinces/territories have announced that in determining 
financial/disability assistance they will provide a full or partial 
exemption of RDSP assets and income.

Make the Most of the Old Age 
Security (OAS) Program
H
ey, this tip may not deal solely with income tax, but it’s good 
news just the same because the Old Age Security (OAS), 
a monthly public pension payment, can be a source of money 
for you. Yes, OAS is subject to tax — and the scary part is that 
depending on your income level the tax may be 100 percent!
The OAS is available to most Canadians age 65 and over, even if 
they no longer live in Canada. The amount is adjusted quarterly for 
increases in the cost of living as measured by the Consumer Price 
Index; the maximum monthly OAS pension payment for October to 
December 2009 was $516.96. The OAS is administered by Human 
Resources and Skills Development Canada (HRSDC) with the assis-
tance of Service Canada.
Look at Eligibility Criteria
Eligibility for an OAS pension is based on two criteria: age and 
years resided in Canada. OAS pension is not affected by your 
employment history, and you’re entitled to receive it whether or 
not you have retired. Two categories of people are eligible for OAS:
 
✓ People living in Canada who are 65 or older, are Canadian citi-
zens or legal residents and have lived in Canada for at least 10 
years while adults and
 
✓ People living outside Canada who are 65 or older, were 
Canadian citizens or legal residents at the time they ceased to 
live in Canada and had lived in Canada for at least 20 years as 
an adult.
 
Don’t fall into either of these categories? You still may be eligible 
to receive OAS! Canada has a number of social security agreements 
with other countries. If you lived in one of these countries or con-
tributed to its social security system, you may qualify for a pen-
sion from that country, Canada, or both. Need more information to 
determine whether you qualify? Contact HRSDC at 1-800-277-9914. 

313
 #64: Make the Most of the Old Age Security (OAS) Program
HRSDC’s Web site at www.hrsdc.gc.ca will help too. You can 
also drop in to a Service Canada Centre; addresses can be found 
on Service Canada’s Web site at www.servicecanada.gc.ca. 
(Note that these points of contact apply for all the questions you 
may have — or forms you may need — based on the information in 
this tip.)
Full or partial OAS pension
The main criterion in determining whether you’re entitled to a full 
or partial OAS pension is the length of time you’ve been in Canada. 
A full OAS pension is available where you
 
✓ Lived in Canada for at least 40 years after your 18th birthday, or
 
✓ Were born on July 1, 1952, or earlier, and
 
• Lived in Canada on July 1, 1977,
 
• Lived in Canada for some period of time between your 
18th birthday and July 1, 1977, or
 
• Lived in Canada for 10 years immediately prior to your 
OAS application being approved.
Don’t qualify because you haven’t lived in Canada for the past 10 
years? Don’t fret! You should still qualify for full OAS if you lived 
in Canada for the year immediately before your application was 
approved, or prior to those past 10 years, you lived in Canada 
as an adult for a period of at least three times the length of your 
absences during the past 10 years. (Go ahead — do the math!).
If you don’t qualify for a full OAS pension, a partial pension may be 
available to you. The amount you would receive is based on the 
number of complete years you lived in Canada after turning 18.
Apply for OAS six months ahead!
To ensure your OAS payments start on time, apply six months before your 65th 
birthday. An application kit (ISP3000) is available from any Service Canada Centre, 
or call 1-800-277-9914. You can also print the kit from the HRSDC Web site at www.
hrsdc.gc.ca. You can’t apply online, but you can complete the form online, 
print it, sign and date it, and then mail it to a Service Canada Centre. If you apply 
after age 65, you can receive back payments up to 11 months.

Understand the OAS Is Taxable
Your OAS pension is taxable, and reporting the tax on your return 
is very simple. You’ll receive a T4A(OAS) information slip summa-
rizing the amount paid. Expect this slip to arrive in January follow-
ing the year the OAS was received. If you’re computer savvy, you 
can also see your slip online — follow the links on the Web site at 
www.hrsdc.gc.ca.
Include the amount noted in box 18 on line 113 of your tax return. 
Some tax may have been held back on the OAS pension payment to 
you; this amount will be noted in box 22 of the T4A(OAS). Be sure 
to include the withheld tax on line 437 of your return.
 
If you want to reduce the amount of tax that comes due on April 30
each year, you can request that tax be withheld from your OAS 
pension payments.
Be wary of the OAS “Clawback”
Much to the chagrin of seniors, our government believes that 
those with net income in excess of $66,335 (for 2009) do not need 
a full OAS pension. When a taxpayer has received OAS higher 
than his or her calculated maximum OAS entitlement, the excess 
amount must be repaid — or “clawed back”. The amount that 
must be repaid is equal to 15 percent of net income in excess of 
$66,335 — stay tuned for an example. The clawback works by 
reducing monthly OAS payments to take into account an individu-
al’s expected repayment. High-income individuals do not receive 
any OAS at all. This withholding of OAS adds a measure of com-
plexity to tax return preparation, as we explain below.
The CRA determines whether you have to make an OAS repayment 
based on information in your tax return. If you owe a repayment 
the CRA tells the HRSDC, which in turn adjusts your future monthly 
OAS payments. Assuming you file your 2009 tax return by April 30, 
2010, the CRA should assess you by the end of June 2010. Based on 
your 2009 return, HRSDC will adjust your next 12 monthly OAS pay-
ments beginning with the one for July 2010 — your July 2010 pay-
ment may be significantly different from your June 2010 payment! 
In other words, HRSDC anticipates you will have to repay all or a 
portion of your 2010 OAS in an amount that is approximately what 
you had to repay for the 2009 OAS. Rather than paying you the OAS 
and then waiting for you to repay it as part of your 2010 tax return, 
HRSDC simply reduces the amount of your monthly OAS cheque.

315
 #64: Make the Most of the Old Age Security (OAS) Program
What if your 2010 net income is lower than your 2009 net income? 
No worries . . . the government will pay any difference between 
what you received and what you were entitled to by decreasing 
your tax liability (or increasing your tax refund) on your 2010 tax 
return.
Say Jim turned 65 on January 1, 2009. He applied for OAS six 
months before his 65th birthday. (We have purposely made Jim’s 
income exceed $66,335 to detail the calculation and impact of the 
OAS repayment on his tax return and tax liability.)
 
Let’s work through an illustration of how Jim’s OAS repayment (or 
“clawback”) is calculated.
Old Age Security (OAS) pension (estimate)  
$ 6,000
Other pension income  
  
 
 
$70,000
Interest income  
  
 
 
$ 2,000
Deduction for support payments made 
to former spouse 
 
 
 
($5,000)
Net income before deduction for 
OAS repayment (line 234 on tax return)  
$73,000
Net income before deduction for 
OAS repayment (as above)  
 
 
$73,000
Less base amount  
  
 
 
$66,335
Excess net income  
  
 
 
$ 6,665
Net income before deduction for 
OAS repayment (as above)  
 
 
$73,000
Less repayment — 15 percent on excess 
net income (line 235 on tax return)  
 
$ 1,000
Net income after OAS repayment 
(line 236 on tax return) 
 
 
$72,000
Jim will note the $1,000 of OAS he is required to pay back on line 
422 of his 2009 tax return, and it will increase his 2009 tax liability 
or decrease his refund.
 
Protect your OAS! Based on an OAS maximum for 2009 of $6,060 
when your net income is $107,692 or more, you’ll repay all your 
OAS — a full OAS clawback! In other words, a 100-percent tax on 
your OAS. Use the tips in this book including pension splitting (Tip 
#68) to minimize your net income to minimize or eliminate your 
OAS clawback!

Part V: Tips for Special Tax Planning Circumstances  
316
 
If you and your spouse elect to take advantage of the pension-
sp litting rules (Tip #68) you may find that the spouse in the lower 
tax bracket now has an OAS clawback or an increased clawback. 
The “lost” OAS due to the clawback (or increased clawback) needs 
to be weighed against the tax savings from electing to take advan-
tage of the pension-splitting rules.
Apply for Other OAS Payments
In addition to a regular OAS pension, a taxpayer may be entitled to 
additional payments under the OAS program. None of the follow-
ing payments are taxable but they must be reported on your tax 
return. The amount paid to you is noted in box 21 of the T4A(OAS) 
slip. The amount is to be reported as income on line 146 of your 
return and then deducted on line 250. To receive these special 
non-taxable OAS payments you must apply using form ISP3026:
 
✓ Guaranteed income supplement: The guaranteed income 
supplement (GIS) provides low-income seniors in Canada with 
supplementary pension payments in addition to the regular 
OAS pension. The GIS is based on your income and marital 
status. 
 
✓ The allowance: The allowance is an additional amount paid to 
low-income seniors aged 60 to 64 with a spouse or common-
law partner who receives the OAS and GIS. It’s like an early 
OAS pension. To receive it, you must meet some residency 
requirements.
 
✓ The allowance for the survivor: Additional money is paid to 
low-income seniors aged 60 to 64 if their spouse or common-
law partner has died and they meet residency requirements.
 
To continue receiving the GIS, the allowance, or the survivor’s 
allowance, ensure you file a tax return by April 30 each year. 
Without a tax return on file, your payments will stop!

Know When to Take Your 
CPP/QPP Retirement Pension
Just like Tip #64 on dealing with Old Age Security (OAS), we 
include this tip to ensure you make the most of your Canada 
Pension Plan (CPP) or Quebec Pension Plan (QPP) entitlement. (Be 
sure to also check out Tip #68, which details some tax saving avail-
able by “sharing” CPP with a spouse/common-law partner!)
After the OAS (Tip #64), the CPP (and its Quebec counterpart, 
the QPP) is a second level of public pension available to certain 
Canadians. However, unlike the OAS pension, which is available 
to all Canadians who meet certain residency requirements, you 
receive a CPP/QPP pension only when you’ve paid into the plan. If 
you earned employment or self-employment income during your 
working days, you most likely paid into one (or both) of these 
plans and can reap some benefits in your retirement years.
Available CPP/QPP Benefits
Table 5-1 lists the variety of benefits you can receive under the 
CPP/QPP and notes whether they’re taxable.

Report CPP/QPP Income 
on Your Tax Return
Each January, HRSDC sends CPP recipients a T4A(P) tax slip. (You 
can also see your slip online at www.hrsdc.gc.ca.) Enter the 
amount noted in box 20 on line 114 of your tax return. Amounts in 
the other boxes on the slip provide a breakdown of your sources 
of CPP. You don’t need to report these amounts on your tax return, 
with the exception of box 16 — the disability benefit. Enter this 
amount on line 152 of your return, which is just to the left of line 
114. Don’t add box 152 when calculating your total income; the 
amount is already included in box 114.
The CPP Retirement Pension
The CPP is a monthly pension paid to individuals who have con-
tributed to the CPP, or to both the CPP and QPP if they live outside 
Quebec.
 
Like OAS, you must apply to receive a CPP retirement pension. 
After you qualify to begin to receive CPP you’re permitted to work 
as much as you like and your pension amount will not be affected. 
However, you can no longer contribute to the CPP. (This will 
change when the new CPP rules come into being in 2012. We dis-
cuss these proposed new rules later in this tip.)
 
To find out how much CPP you’re entitled to at different start dates, 
contact HRSDC. Simply fill out form ISP1003, “Estimate Request for 
Canada Pension Plan Retirement Pension,” with alternative start 
dates. The closer you are to the date you want your pension to 
begin, the more accurate the estimate will be. The form is available 
at any Service Canada Centre or online at www.hrsdc.gc.ca.
Comparing CPP and QPP
The Quebec government administers the QPP on behalf of the residents of Quebec. 
Human Resources and Skills Development Canada (HRSDC), with the assistance of 
Service Canada, administers the CPP for the remaining nine provinces and three 
territories. With respect to most issues, the two plans operate in a similar fashion. 
For simplicity and conciseness, most of this tip deals with CPP issues.
For details on QPP contact Régie des rentes du Québec via its Web site (www.
rrq.gouv.qc.ca) or toll-free phone (1-800-463-5185).

 #65: Know When to Take Your CPP/QPP Retirement Pension
 
As with the OAS, you may qualify for a CPP retirement pension that 
is based not only on contributions you have made to the plan, but 
also on contributions you have made to another country’s social 
security system. This is good news if you were in Canada for only 
a short while before you retired but had previously worked in and 
paid social security taxes to another country. See the International 
Benefits section on the HRSDC Web site (www.hrsdc.gc.ca) for 
further information.

directly to your bank account.
Take Your CPP Retirement 
Pension Early — or Late!
The CPP retirement pension is designed to be paid starting when 
an individual turns 65. However, you have the option of taking a 
discounted payment at any time between the ages of 60 and 64. 
The current rules are to be changed in 2012; for your convenience 
we’ve summarized the current rules and the proposed new rules.
Current rules
If you decide to start your CPP retirement pension before you’re 
65 years of age, the payments are reduced by 6 percent for each 
year (0.5 percent per month) that you’re under 65. So if you decide 
to take your CPP at 60 you’ll receive 70 percent of what your full 
entitlement would have been at 65.
Apply for CPP six months ahead!
You can apply for your CPP retirement pension online at www.hrsdc.gc.ca. 
After you submit the application you’ll be asked to print and sign a signature page 
and then send it to a Service Canada Centre. If you don’t want to apply online, you 
can fill out the form by hand and mail it in. You need form ISP1000, and can find it in 
the forms area of the HRSDC Web site at www.hrsdc.gc.ca. You can also pick 
up an application at any Service Canada Centre, or call 1-800-277-9914 for a copy. 
HRSDC suggests you apply six months before you want your retirement pension to 
begin (much like the OAS, Tip #64).

Part V: Tips for Special Tax Planning Circumstances

To choose this option, you must have stopped working, or you 
must have been earning less than the monthly maximum CPP 
retirement pension for at least two months; this amount was 
$908.75 per month in 2009. When you begin receiving CPP you’re 
no longer required to make CPP contributions. (If you’re 65 or over 
no work cessation restrictions apply in collecting your CPP retire-
ment pension.)
If you elect to start receiving your CPP retirement pension after 
age 65, you’re entitled to an increased amount — again, 6 percent 
per year (or 0.5 percent per month). If you wait until your 70th 
birthday, your entitlement increases by 30 percent! The amount 
cannot be increased more than 30 percent — so, waiting until 
you’re 71 or 72 will not get you a bigger CPP retirement pension.
How do you decide when to start taking your CPP retirement pen-
sion? HRSDC suggests you consider the following:
 
✓ Whether you’re still working and contributing to the CPP
 
✓ How long you have contributed
 
✓ How much your earnings were
 
✓ What your other sources of retirement income are
 
✓ How your health is
 
✓ What your retirement plans are, including desired lifestyle
In general, if you’re still working or don’t need the extra cash flow 
the CPP will provide, you might want to wait to get a bigger pen-
sion later. On the other hand, if your health is poor or the extra 
cash flow will come in handy, you might opt to take your CPP early 
in order to maximize your situation.
Proposed new rules
In May 2009 new proposals were announced regarding receiving 
your CPP early or late; the proposals are to become effective in 
2012. A major positive change is that you won’t have to retire — 
or work for little income — to begin collecting your CPP early 
(between the ages of 60 and 64). However, you’ll need to contrib-
ute to the CPP while you are working, and should you begin col-
lecting CPP at 60 you’ll receive only 64 percent of your entitlement 
rather than the current 70 percent. (As they say, “there’s no free 
lunch!”). If you take your CPP late — say, at 70 — your CPP will be 
increased by 42 percent rather than the current 30 percent.

 #65: Know When to Take Your CPP/QPP Retirement Pension
Know about Other CPP Benefits
In addition to the retirement pension, the CPP also provides CPP 
disability benefits and CPP survivor benefits.
CPP disability benefits
The CPP will provide you with a monthly pension if you’ve been 
a CPP contributor and are considered mentally or physically dis-
abled. Your disability must be “severe and prolonged.” HRSDC con-
siders “severe” to mean that you cannot work regularly at any job, 
and “prolonged” to mean that your condition is long-term or may 
lead to death. The benefit comprises a flat amount plus a second 
amount based on the number of years you have contributed to 
the CPP. The maximum monthly disability benefit in 2009 was 
$1,105.99.
Payments can also be made to dependant children. If you become 
disabled, your child under 18 can qualify for a benefit. If your child 
is between ages 18 and 25, he or she will still qualify if attending 
school full-time. The maximum amount paid in 2009 was $213.99 
per month per child.
 
You must apply for both the regular disability benefit and the chil-
dren’s benefit. Form ISP1151, “Application for Disability Benefits,” 
is available online at www.hrsdc.gc.ca, or you can call 1-800-277-
9914 or drop by a Service Canada Centre. Apply as soon as you 
consider yourself to have a long-term disability that prevents you 
from working at any job. The government will require a medical 
report from your doctor.
CPP survivor benefits
CPP survivor benefits are paid to your estate, surviving spouse/
common-law partner, and dependant children. The three types of 
survivor benefits are the death benefit, the survivor’s pension, and 
the children’s benefit.
 
✓ Death benefit. The death benefit is a one-time payment to 
your estate. The maximum amount for this benefit is $2,500.
 
✓ Survivor’s pension. Your surviving spouse/common-law 
partner can receive a monthly pension. The amount of the 
payment depends on how long you paid into the CPP, your 
spouse or common-law partner’s age when you die, and 
whether he or she is receiving a CPP retirement or disability 

Part V: Tips for Special Tax Planning Circumstances  
322
pension. The calculation is based on what your CPP retire-
ment pension would have been had you been 65 at the time 
of death. This amount is then adjusted to take into account 
the age of your survivor. The maximum amount that can be 
received is 60 percent of what your retirement pension would 
have been — the 2009 monthly maximum is $545.25, or 60 per-
cent of $908.75. To receive this amount, your survivor must 
be age 65 or over at the time of your death. If your survivor is 
younger, the payments are lower. (The maximum for a survi-
vor under 65 in 2009 was $506.38.)
 
✓ Children’s benefit. The children’s benefit is a monthly pay-
ment to a deceased contributor’s dependant children. At the 
time of the contributor’s death, the child must be under 18, 
or between the ages of 18 and 25 and enrolled full time in a 
recognized educational institution. The maximum monthly 
amount in 2009 was $213.99. At least one of the child’s parents 
must have been a contributor to the CPP. A child may get two 
benefits if both parents are deceased or disabled.
 
You must apply for CPP survivor benefits. Applications are avail-
able at Service Canada Centres, on the HRSDC Web site at www.
hrsdc.gc.ca, or by calling 1-800-277-9914.
Splitting CPP Credits: CPP 
and Marriage Breakdown
CPP credits are used to determine the amount of your entitlement 
to a CPP retirement pension. Because spouses/common-law part-
ners build up credits during a marriage or common-law relation-
ship, when a marriage breaks down both can share in the CPP 
entitlements earned while they were together. CPP credits can 
be split even when only one spouse/common-law partner paid 
into the CPP. You or your ex or one of your lawyers can apply to 
HRSDC. For more on the tax implications of a marriage breakdown, 
see Tip #53.

Be Smart in Receiving Other 
Types of Pension Income
You’ve worked hard, saved for retirement, and perhaps are a 
member of your former employer’s pension plan. Now you’re 
in the stage where you’re receiving payments from the plan, or 
maybe taking out some of your retirement savings through with-
drawals from an RRSP, RRIF, or similar retirement saving vehicle. 
Understand the Pension 
Income You Receive
The dollar amounts of your various pension incomes are to be 
aggregated and reported on line 115 of your tax return. This is 
fairly straightforward — most pension income will be reported on 
T4A slips or other tax information slips. 
Here are descriptions of the various types of pension income:
 
✓ Payments from a former employer’s or union’s registered 
pension plan (box 16 of T4A slip).
 
✓ Payments from an RRIF — registered retirement income 
fund (T4RIF slip) — and payments from an annuity (T4A 
slip). If you’re under age 65, report these amounts on line 130 
of your return — not on line 115. This is because these types 
of pension income do not qualify for the pension income 
credit (Tip #67) when you are under 65.
 
✓ Certain annuity income. If you’ve purchased an annuity with 
non-RRSP funds, the annuity payments you receive are part 
interest and part capital. The capital portion is not subject 
to tax because it represents a partial return of the purchase 
price that you funded with tax-paid dollars. The interest 
portion is usually taxed as interest (hey, this makes sense!). 
However, if you’re age 65 or older and have receipts from a 
“mixed annuity” (an annuity payment in which the interest 
and capital portion are determined by tax rules), the interest 
portion is considered pension income and is reported on 
line 115.

Part V: Tips for Special Tax Planning Circumstances  
324
Foreign Pension Income
Foreign pension income refers to any pension income received 
from a source outside Canada. A common type is U.S. social secu-
rity paid to a resident of Canada. To receive this you would have 
worked in the U.S. at some time in your life. If you worked in the 
U.S. or any foreign country you may have been part of a foreign 
employer’s pension plan. You also may have served in a foreign 
country’s armed forces and be entitled to a pension. Most foreign 
pension income is subject to tax — but not all! 
U.S. social security income
Include the full amount of U.S. social security income you receive 
on line 115. Of course, you’ll need to translate the U.S.-dollar 
amount received into a Canadian-dollar amount!
 
On line 256 of your return, you can take a 15 percent deduction of 
the amount you received in U.S. social security. This results in only 
85 percent of your U.S. social security being subject to tax!
Other foreign pension income
You include foreign pension income on line 115 of your tax return 
after applying the appropriate exchange rate. If the foreign country 
withheld tax from your pension payment, do not deduct the tax, 
but report the gross pension receipt. The foreign tax paid may 
qualify as a tax credit (referred to as a foreign tax credit) in calcu-
lating your tax liability.
 
Canada has a number of tax treaties with other countries. A treaty 
may adjust the amount of a foreign pension that is taxed in Canada. 
The CRA can assist you in determining whether any of your foreign 
pension is partially or completely exempt from Canadian tax; call 
1-800-267-5177. To make this determination the CRA will ask for 
details about your pension, so keep any documents sent to you 
from the pension plan. If you determine that an amount is not tax-
able in Canada, it’s best to include the income in your return on 
line 115 and deduct the amount on line 256.

Maximize the Age Amount 
and Pension Income 
Amount Tax Credits
A
s we discuss in Tips #64, #65, and #66, you have to pay tax on 
your OAS, CPP, and other pensions. The silver lining is that 
you have a few ways to at least reduce the tax burden on your pen-
sion income. In this tip we look at how you can save tax by simply 
being 65 years of age or older and how you can claim a tax credit 
on the first $2,000 of certain types of your pension income. In Tip 
#68, we bring your spouse or common-law partner into your tax 
planning as we discuss CPP sharing and pension splitting.
Know How a Tax Credit and 
a Tax Deduction Differ
 
The age amount tax credit and the pension income amount tax 
credit are two of a number of non-refundable tax credits available 
to taxpayers. Non-refundable tax credits directly reduce the tax 
you owe — they don’t reduce your taxable income. In this way 
they differ from tax deductions, which are subtracted in comput-
ing your taxable income. Examples of tax deductions include 
your RRSP contributions (Tip #42), eligible interest (Tip #47), and 
employment expenses (Tip #22).
These credits are referred to as “non-refundable” because if they 
exceed your tax liability you don’t get a refund of the excess. 
With a tax credit, all taxpayers are subject to the same tax savings. 
The tax savings from a tax deduction increases as your taxable 
income increases to be taxed in higher tax brackets.

Part V: Tips for Special Tax Planning Circumstances  
326
Non-refundable tax credit amounts differ from non-refundable tax 
credits. The non-refundable tax credit is the actual federal tax 
reduction — or tax savings — available. The amount of the tax credit 
is based on the non-refundable tax credit amount available to you.
For all but one (the charitable donation tax credit, Tip #9) of the 
non-refundable tax credits, the federal tax savings is 15 percent of 
the non-refundable amount to which you’re entitled. (A provincial/
territorial tax savings also applies; the actual savings depends on 
what province/territory you live in.)
Maximize Your Age 
Amount Tax Credit
You qualify for the maximum age credit amount of $6,658 for 2009 
if you were 65 years of age or older on December 31, 2009. The age 
amount is entered on line 301 of schedule 1 of your tax return. The 
maximum federal tax savings is $998.70. 
Now for the bad news. Although the maximum credit amount is 
$6,658, it’s reduced by 15 percent of your net income (from line 
236 of your tax return) in excess of $32,312. The age amount you’re 
able to claim is reduced as your income exceeds this level. If your 
income is $32,312 or less, you’ll be able to claim the maximum age 
amount.
For example, suppose Alice turned 65 in 2009. Her net income for 
the year (as reported on line 236 of her tax return) is $35,000. Her 
age credit is reduced by $403: ($35,000 – $32,312 × 15%). This means 
she can claim $6,255 ($6,658 – $403) on line 301 on schedule 1 of her 
tax return as her age credit amount. Her federal tax savings will be 
$938 ($6,255 × 15%).
 
You’re not entitled to any age amount if your net income exceeds 
$76,699. The age credit amount will work out to zero.
 
The lower your net income, the greater the tax savings of the age 
amount! To the extent possible, reduce your net income to maxi-
mize the age amount available to you — through income splitting 
(Tip #50), CPP sharing and pension splitting (Tip #68), and maxi-
mizing tax deductions through contributions to your own or a 
spousal RRSP (Tip #43).

327
 #67: Maximize Age and Pension Income Credits 
Claim the Pension Income 
Credit Amount
You can claim up to a $2,000 pension income credit amount if you 
report pension and/or annuity income on line 115 or line 129 of 
your tax return. The maximum federal tax savings is $300.
Unfortunately, you can’t be too quick in assuming you’re entitled 
to the full $2,000 pension income amount! Only pension or annu-
ity income you report on line 115 or 129 qualifies for the pension 
income credit amount.
Amounts such as Old Age Security (OAS) benefits, Canada/Quebec 
Pension Plan (CPP/QPP) benefits, Saskatchewan Pension Plan pay-
ments, death benefits, and retiring allowances do not qualify for 
the pension income amount. Non-annuity income you withdraw 
from your RRSP similarly does not qualify for the pension amount.
 
If you’re age 65 or over but do not have sufficient pension income 
to qualify for the full credit (that is, your eligible pension income 
is less than $2,000), you can create pension income by converting 
all or part of your RRSP to an RRIF or a life annuity. Or, you can 
purchase a life annuity with other available funds. The income 
from either of these investment vehicles is eligible for the pension 
income credit amount..
 
Through pension income splitting (Tip #68) you may be able to 
create eligible pension income for your spouse/common-law part-
ner so that he or she also can take advantage of this $2,000 pen-
sion income credit amount.
 
If your spouse/common-law partner does not need all or a por-
tion of the non-refundable tax credit that arises from the pension 
amount to reduce his or her federal tax to zero, it may be transfer-
able to you (Tip #49).
 
If you’re under 65, the pension amount is available only when 
you’ve received payments from a pension plan and/or received 
annuity payments due to the death of your spouse — or if based 
on pension splitting you included these types of pension income 
on your tax return.

Reduce Your Family’s Tax 
Bill by Sharing CPP and 
Pension Splitting
I
ncome splitting — or income sharing, or shifting — is one of the 
best, and easiest, tax planning ideas we can offer.
The concept is straightforward. When possible — meaning when 
permitted by the Income Tax Act — split, share, or shift income 
earned by one family member with another family member who is 
taxed at a lower tax bracket than the family member who earned 
the income. The gross family income remains the same but the tax 
bite is reduced, leaving more money for the family to spend on 
groceries, vacations, home repairs, university tuition — you get 
the idea. 
Sharing Your CPP Retirement 
Pension
 
Don’t confuse sharing your CPP with the tax planning opportunity 
provided by pension splitting (also discussed in this tip).
In undertaking CPP sharing you and your spouse/common-law 
partner receive an equal share of the CPP retirement pension you 
both earned during the years you were together (not separated or 
divorced). If only one spouse/common-law partner is entitled to a 
CPP retirement pension, then the one CPP pension can be shared. 
Sharing your CPP does not increase or decrease the overall retire-
ment pension to which you and your spouse/common-law partner 
are entitled. CPP sharing is simply undertaken to reduce the fam-
ily’s tax burden.

329
 #68: Share CPP and Split Pensions
CPP sharing eligibility 
and how to apply
To share your CPP retirement pension entitlements, you and your 
spouse/common-law partner must both be at least 60 years of age, 
and you must request that your CPP retirement pension be shared.
The request is made on form ISP1002, “Application for Pension 
Sharing of Retirement Pension(s) Canada Pension Plan.” You can 
download the form from the HDRSC Web site (www.hrsdc.gc.ca) 
or pick one up at any Service Canada office.
After the application is accepted, the CPP retirement pension 
cheques (or direct deposit) sent to you and your spouse/common-
law partner will reflect the CPP sharing, as will the T4A(P) slip, 
“Statement of Canada Pension Plan Benefits,” you receive at the 
end of each year to use in completing your tax return.
Stopping CPP sharing
The CPP sharing will stop when
 
✓ Either of you dies
  
✓ You become separated, divorced, or your common-law 
relationship ends
 
✓ You make a request to stop CPP sharing. Form ISP1014 
“Cancellation of Pension Sharing for Canada Pension Plan 
Retirement Pension(s)” is be completed, signed by both 
spouses/common-law partners and mailed to nearest Service 
Canada office.
Sharing QPP retirement benefits
The Quebec Pension Plan (QPP) also contains provisions for shar-
ing. However, different eligibility requirements apply than with the 
CPP. It’s best to contact La Régie des rentes du Québec (www.rrq.
gouv.qc.ca or toll-free at 1-800-463-5185).
Pension Splitting
In addition to sharing your CPP with your spouse/common-law 
partner as discussed above, you can also “share” or “split” other 
types of pension income.

Part V: Tips for Special Tax Planning Circumstances  
330
 
Unlike in CPP sharing, with pension splitting you don’t need to con-
tact the payer of the pension income. The pension can continue 
to be paid to one spouse and the tax information slip (that is, the 
T4A, T4RIF) is issued solely to the actual recipient of the pension. 
No actual payment needs to be made to the other spouse. In other 
words, in using pension splitting you don’t have to do anything 
except make a few new notations on tax returns and complete form 
T1032, “Joint Election to Split Pension Income.”
Up to 50 percent of certain types of pension income can be split, 
shifted, or allocated from a higher-tax-bracket spouse/common-law 
partner to a lower-tax-bracket spouse/common-law partner. This 
results in the couple paying less tax! The tax paid by the lower-
tax-bracket spouse/common-law partner will be less than the tax 
saved by the higher-tax-bracket spouse/common-law partner.
An example will make this a little clearer. Assume your taxable 
income is $180,000, including $50,000 of pension income from 
your former employer. At $180,000 of income you’re in the top tax 
bracket (which begins at $126,265 for 2009). Let’s say you live in a 
province/territory where the top tax rate is 45 percent and, to keep 
this really simple, that your spouse/common-law partner has no 
taxable income.

$25,000 (the maximum is 50 percent of $50,000) to your spouse’s 
tax return. As this will be your spouse’s/common-law partner’s 
only income it will be taxed in the lowest tax bracket which again 
varies by province/territory. In this example we assume 21%. (For 
2009 the lowest tax bracket ends at taxable income of $40,726.)

 #68: Reduce Your Family’s Tax Bill by Sharing CPP and . . .
The tax is reduced to $16,500 from $22,500 — a $6,000 saving!
The pension-splitting result is optimal when one spouse/common-
law partner is in the highest tax bracket and the other spouse is in 
the lowest tax bracket.
The decrease in the higher-tax-bracket spouse’s/common-law part-
ner’s income could cause his or her OAS clawback to be reduced 
or eliminated (see Tip #64 for more on the OAS clawback).
 
The increase in the lower-tax-bracket spouse’s/common-law part-
ner’s income could cause him or her to have an OAS clawback or 
an increase in the current OAS clawback.
 
Because the lower-tax-bracket spouse/common-law partner will 
report a higher net income as a result of electing to pension split, 
the age credit (see Tip #67) available prior to pension splitting can 
be reduced or eliminated. (The age credit decreases as income 
begins to exceed $32,312.) As well, the higher-tax-bracket spouse’s/
common-law partner’s claim for a spouse or common-law partner 
amount can be reduced or eliminated.
To decide whether an election to pension split makes sense, weigh 
these implications in light of the tax savings pension splitting can 
provide.
Determining whether you qualify 
for pension splitting
The pension splitting rules apply to Canadian residents who are 
married or in a common-law relationship at the end of the year. 
The maximum amount of eligible pension income that can be split 
is prorated in cases where a couple comes together during a year 
or one of the spouses dies.
 
You can split your pension income with your spouse even if he or 
she is under the age of 65.
Deciding whether your pension 
income qualifies for pension splitting
To make use of the pension-splitting rules the pension recipient 
must receive “eligible” pension income. To figure out what is 
eligible pension income it’s easiest first to see what represents 
ineligible pension income for purposes of pension splitting:

Part V: Tips for Special Tax Planning Circumstances  
332
 
✓ Old Age Security (OAS) payments
 
✓ Canada or Quebec Pension Plan (CPP/QPP). (Other rules 
apply for sharing this type of income; see our comments 
earlier in this tip.)
 
✓ Non-annuity registered retirement savings plan (RRSP) 
withdrawals
 
✓ Withdrawals from a retirement compensation agreement 
(RCA)
When the actual pension recipient is age 65 or over at the end of a 
year, the pension income eligible for splitting includes the following:
 
✓ Annuity payments from a registered pension plan (RPP)
 
✓ Annuity payments from a deferred profit sharing plan (DPSP)
 
✓ Registered retirement income fund (RRIF) and life income 
fund (LIF) withdrawals.
When the actual pension recipient is under 65 at the end of a year, 
the pension income eligible for splitting includes the following:
 
✓ Annuity payments from a registered pension plan (RPP)
 
✓ Amounts listed under “Eligible pension income for pension 
splitting” above if received by virtue of the death of a spouse/
common-law partner.
Knowing how to pension split
It’s simple! The pension splitting rules are elective on an annual 
basis. Follow these steps:
 
1. The amount to be split is deducted on line 210 on the tax 
return of the spouse who actually received the pension — 
the high-tax-bracket spouse/common-law partner.
 
2. The amount is added to the income reported on the 
other spouse’s/common-law partner’s tax return — the 
low-tax-bracket spouse/common-law partner — on line 116.
 
3. The tax withheld on the actual pension payments to the 
high-tax-bracket spouse/common-law partner is allocated 
to the other spouse/common-law partner on the same 
basis as the pension income was split. (This removes the 
cash-flow burden of requiring the low-tax-bracket spouse/
common-law partner to come up with a significant amount 
of money on April 30!)

333
 #68: Reduce Your Family’s Tax Bill by Sharing CPP and . . .
Both spouses/common-law partners must agree to partake in pen-
sion splitting and the amount to be split, and must complete and 
sign two copies of form T1032, “Joint Election to Split Pension 
Income.” Each spouse/common-law partner must include the form 
with their tax return if paper filing. If electronically filing each 
spouse/common-law partner needs to keep a copy in case the CRA 
asks to see it.
Claiming an extra pension 
income credit
The rules for the pension income credit (Tip #67) were expanded 
when the pension-splitting rules came into being back in 2007. If 
both spouses/common-law partners are over age 65, then each 
will receive up to $2,000 in pension income credits. (If the eligible 
pension income is less than $2,000 the credit maxes out at the 
actual eligible pension income taxed to each spouse/common-law 
partner.) The result is that pension splitting may serve to permit 
another pension income credit amount of $2,000 in the family 
where the lower-tax-bracket spouse/common-law partner was not 
entitled to it previously.
The rules are a bit trickier if both spouses/common-law partners 
aren’t over age 65. In that case, if the payments came from a regis-
tered pension plan (RPP) then each spouse/common-law partner 
is entitled to a pension credit regardless of age. However, in most 
circumstances payments from an RRSP or RRIF will not qualify for 
the pension credit in the hands of a spouse/common-law partner 
under age 65. In that situation, you may still benefit from paying 
less tax if each spouse/common-law partner is in a different tax 
bracket — you just won’t benefit from the pension credit as well.

Know That the U.S. Internal 
Revenue Service May Have 
an Interest in You
W
e’re guessing most of you are quite familiar with paying 
taxes to — and dealing with — the Canada Revenue Agency 
(CRA). However, a number of individuals who live in Canada also 
have the pleasure of filing an income tax return with the U.S. 
Internal Revenue Service — better known as the IRS.
Not to ruin the party, but if you die owning U.S. assets you can 
be subject to U.S. estate tax. Yikes! (We discuss U.S. estate tax in 
Tip #70.)
In this tip we will look at when you may need to file a U.S. income 
tax return.
Knowing When to File a 
U.S. Income Tax Return
You must file an income tax return with the IRS when you fit into 
one of the following categories:
 
✓ You’re a U.S. citizen: U.S. citizens are required to file a U.S. 
income tax return (IRS form 1040), report their worldwide 
income on the return, and pay U.S. federal income tax no 
matter what country they live in.
 
✓ Canada’s income tax treaty with the U.S. and the Canadian 
and U.S. foreign tax credit mechanisms are designed to avoid 
having taxpayers taxed twice on the same income. So, report-
ing the same income on your Canadian and U.S. income tax 
returns (adjusted for the different currencies, of course) does 
not mean you’ll be subject to double tax. The CRA and IRS 
aren’t that unfair.

 #69: Know the IRS May Have an Interest in You 
 
✓ You’re a “green card” holder — or the holder of a U.S. 
Permanent Resident Card These folks have the same U.S. tax 
filing rules as a U.S. citizen. (By the way, the card is no longer 
green.)
 
✓ You’re a Canadian resident considered by the U.S. to be a 
“resident alien” or “non-resident alien” (We laughed too 
when we first heard the word “alien” used in discussing U.S. 
income taxes.)
Deciding if You’re an Alien
In this section, we help you determine whether you’re a resident 
or non-resident alien of the U.S. (It’s not as straightforward as you 
might think!)
Resident alien
You’re considered a resident alien of the U.S. if you meet the “sub-
stantial presence test” because of frequent stays in the U.S. and 
cannot claim the “closer connection exception” regarding your ties 
to Canada. You may find you’re a resident alien if you’ve moved to 
the U.S. on a temporary basis for work. Resident aliens are taxed 
in the U.S. on their worldwide income and must file a U.S. income 
return (IRS form 1040) — just like a U.S. citizen.
Substantial presence test
This test is based on your physical presence in the U.S. over the 
last three years. You’re considered substantially present in the 
U.S. when you were present during the current and past two years 
for at least 183 days. To determine the total days you were in the 
U.S., get out your calculator and add up the following (including 
partial days):
 
✓ Each day in 2009 counts as a full day
 
✓ Each day in 2008 counts as one-third day
 
✓ Each day in 2007 counts as one-sixth day
If you were in the U.S. for fewer than 31 days in 2009 you will not 
meet the substantial presence test.
Closer connection exception
If due to frequent vacationing in the U.S. you do meet the substan-
tial presence test, then you’ll be considered resident and required 
to file a U.S. tax return that reports your worldwide income.

Part V: Tips for Special Tax Planning Circumstances  
336
However, you can avoid this tax filing if you’re able to claim you 
were more closely connected with Canada in 2009 than with the U.S. 
because of your significant personal (home, family, assets, social, 
political, church, driver’s licence) and business ties to Canada. A 
closer connection exception is available if you, as the alien 
 
✓ Were present in the U.S. for fewer than 183 days in 2009,
 
✓ Maintained a permanent place of residence in Canada 
throughout 2009, and 
 
✓ Complete and file IRS form 8840, “Closer Connection 
Exception Statement for Aliens,” with the IRS by 
June 15, 2010.
Non-resident alien
You’re considered a non-resident alien of the U.S. when you don’t 
meet the “substantial presence” test or you do meet the substan-
tial presence test but can claim an exception due to having a 
closer connection to Canada (refer to the previous section). This 
includes a large number of Canadians, often referred to as “snow-
birds,” who spend a great deal of time in the U.S. to avoid harsh 
Canadian winters.
A non-resident alien must file a non-resident U.S. income tax return 
(IRS form 1040NR) when, the individual
 
✓ Has U.S. employment income.
 
✓ Has a tax liability on U.S. source income including employ-
ment income, interest, dividends, and royalties.
 
✓ Is engaged in business that can produce income “connected” 
(the IRS’s word) with the U.S. For example, renting out your 
condo in Boca Raton, Florida or your vacation home in 
Tempe, Arizona. You may earn income from renting the prop-
erty or you may have a capital gain on sale.
 
Even though the Canada–U.S. tax treaty is designed to avoid you 
being taxed in both countries, the U.S. has the first right to tax 
rental income and capital gains regarding real estate located in the 
United States. A U.S. income tax return filing would be necessary 
and any U.S. tax paid would qualify for a foreign tax credit when 
completing your Canadian income tax return. 

337
 #69: Know That the U.S. Internal Revenue Service May Have . . .
File U.S. Tax Returns on Time
 
Individuals are taxed based on a calendar year, just as in Canada. 
The key dates to remember are:
 
✓ April 15 (not April 30!):
 
• Due date for previous year’s income tax owing
 
• Due date for filing IRS form 1040 income tax return (U.S. 
citizens, green card holders living in the U.S., and resi-
dent aliens)
 
• Due date for filing form IRS 1040NR for non-resident 
aliens with income subject to withholding tax (i.e., 
employment income)
 
✓ June 15:
 
• Due date for filing IRS form 1040 income tax return for 
U.S. citizens living in Canada
 
• Due date for filing form IRS 1040NR for non-resident 
aliens with income not subject to withholding tax
 
• Due date for filing IRS form 8840 for the closer connec-
tion exception
Don’t forget about state, 
county, and city taxes
Own property in the U.S.? If you’re considered a resident alien, you may be required 
to file a state, county, or city tax return for the area in which you own property. For 
further information go to www.statelocal.net/index.cfm.

Be Aware of U.S. Estate Tax 
Implications on Death
I
n this book we talk a lot about Canadian income tax, and we 
discuss potential U.S. income tax implications in Tip #69. Well, 
we have still another type of tax to comment on — U.S. estate tax.
U.S. estate tax is foreign (pun intended) to most of us because 
Canada doesn’t have a comparable tax. (We understand from our 
grandparents that Canada used to have succession duties, which 
to us look a lot like an estate tax.) In this tip, we fill you in on what 
you need to know about U.S. estate tax.
Understanding U.S. Estate Tax 
Here’s how the Web site irs.gov defines estate tax: “Estate tax is 
a tax on your right to transfer property at your death.” Hmmmm. 
We’re not sure that’s clear. How about simply calling it a tax pay-
able on the value of your assets at the time of your death? (Note: 
The tax is based on the value of U.S. assets at the time of death and 
not only on accrued gain — so the cost of the assets has nothing to 
do with U.S. estate tax.)
The amount of tax, before deductions and credits, varies from 18 
percent (on an estate of US$10,000) to 45 percent (on an estate of 
US$2 million or more). However, the good news is that estate tax 
credits are available and Canadian residents even get some special 
treatment. 
 
Oddly, the estate tax rates are to be reset to zero for 2010 because 
the estate tax has been repealed for the year. Estate tax is to return 
in 2011 unless U.S. legislation comes on stream to alter this.

 # 70: Be Aware of U.S. Estate Tax Implications on Death 339
Know the assets that expose 
you to U.S. estate tax
Because our editor gave us just three pages for this tip we detail 
only the U.S. estate tax implications facing Canadians who are 
considered non-resident aliens of the U.S. (We comment on resi-
dent and non-resident aliens of the U.S. in Tip #69.)
A Canadian non-resident alien is subject to U.S. estate tax on the 
total value of his or her U.S. estate that includes the following: 
 
✓ Shares of U.S. corporations (even if held in Canada)
 
✓ Real estate located in the U.S.
 
✓ Personal property such as cars and furniture in the U.S.
Claim credit against U.S. estate tax
Any U.S. non-resident (Canadian or otherwise) can claim an estate 
tax credit of US$13,000, which effectively means no U.S. estate tax 
applies on the first US$60,000 of a U.S. estate.
For Canadian residents the estate tax credit is increased to 
US$1,455,800 for 2009, but on a prorated basis. (The increased 
credit is due to the Canada – U.S. tax treaty; we first discuss the tax 
treaty in Tip #69.) The proration percentage is determined using 
the formula of
U.S. estate
World-wide estate
If your U.S. estate was 20 percent of your worldwide estate, you 
would be permitted a U.S. estate tax credit of US$291,160 (20 per-
cent of US$1,455,800). This would make the first US$1,104,536 of 
your U.S. estate tax free.
Enjoy the small estate exemption
 
A provision in the Canada – U.S. tax treaty provides relief to 
Canadian residents with worldwide estates worth less than 
US$1,200,000. When this is the case the U.S. estate tax will 
generally apply only to real estate located in the U.S.

Part V: Tips for Special Tax Planning Circumstances  
340
Filing Tax Returns
The U.S. estate tax can affect two tax returns. The first — and most 
obvious — is the U.S. estate return (which is completely separate 
from the U.S. income tax return). The second return that may be 
affected is the final personal Canadian tax return of the deceased.
Prepare a U.S. estate tax return
A U.S. estate return for non-residents of the U.S. is IRS form 706-NA, 
due nine months after the date of death. The return must be filed 
if the deceased’s U.S. estate was worth more than US$60,000 at the 
time of death. A return needs to be filed even if the U.S. estate tax 
liability is zero.
To take advantage of the provisions of the Canada – U.S. tax treaty 
you must provide the details of the deceased’s worldwide assets to 
the IRS in this return.
Claim a foreign tax credit 
on the deceased’s Canadian 
income tax return
 
Where a deceased taxpayer has paid U.S. estate tax, the tax paid 
qualifies for a foreign tax credit on the deceased’s final Canadian 
income tax return. However, the credit is available only up to the 
extent of the Canadian taxes payable on the deceased U.S. source 
income in the year of death.

Undertake Estate Planning
E
state planning sounds ominous. We know that “estate” and 
“death” are terms that often go together — much like death 
and taxes. However, in this tip our goal is to point out that estate 
planning involves more than just income taxes.
Estate planning is a component of financial planning. It focuses on 
minimizing the work and difficulties faced by executors while maxi-
mizing the wealth passed to heirs. Estate planning is far more than 
simply having an up-to-date will. In fact, drafting your will should 
be the last thing you do in documenting your estate plan — all the 
other steps should be taken care of first.
In Tip #72 we dwell on the income tax implications of dying, 
and in Tip #74 we point out the probate fee exposure your estate 
may have.
Decide What Your Estate Is to Do
The first step of an estate plan requires you to decide your estate’s 
purpose:
 
✓ Who are the beneficiaries/heirs to your estate? Family mem-
bers? non-family individuals? charities? Who is to get what?
 
✓ Should your estate be dispersed on death or should it carry 
on? Who will see that your wishes are met?
 
✓ Are funds to be kept aside for a specific purpose? A disabled 
child’s care? a grandchild’s education?
 
✓ Are there assets you wish to be shared after death, such as 
the family cottage?
After you determine your estate’s objectives, design and enact a 
plan to ensure the objectives are reached. It’s vital here to assess 
the income tax and probate consequences; luckily for you, we 
highlight them in Tips #72 and #74.

Part V: Tips for Special Tax Planning Circumstances

Build Your Estate Planning Team
Your estate plan will involve a number of professionals working 
together on your and your family’s behalf:
 
✓ A lawyer to draft a will, powers of attorney, and trust 
agreements, and to ensure the estate plan is compliant with 
relevant succession, estate, trust, and other laws including 
family law,
 
✓ An accountant to point out and calculate income tax and 
probate exposure on death and to ensure tax elections and 
personal, estate, and trust tax returns are prepared and filed 
by the due dates, and
 
✓ An insurance specialist to advise on alternatives in having life 
insurance as part of your estate plan. In Tip #72 we explore 
how life insurance can be an effective way to fund a tax liabil-
ity on death to avoid or minimize the liquidation of an estate’s 
assets to pay an income tax bill.

Reduce Income Tax at Death
A
void planning for your estate and you can leave a significant 
income tax liability upon your death. As death and death 
taxes occur at the same time, you may find that in this situation a 
significant portion of your income is taxed in a top tax bracket and 
therefore loses about 45 percent to the CRA.
In this tip we challenge you to look at your income tax exposure 
at death and then to undertake some tried, tested, and true (and 
legal!) estate planning ideas to minimize the tax to maximize the 
value of your estate being passed to your heirs. (We expect the 
CRA is not one of your desired heirs!)
In Tip #74 we look at minimizing your exposure to provincial/
territorial probate fees (or “estate administration taxes”).
Understand the Relationship 
of Death and Taxes
Without trying to be brazen, when you die you leave the Canadian 
tax system. On death you’re subject to tax for the very last time. 
The tax rules are generally drafted so that any accrued gains 
or income you have at the time of your death are subject to tax. 
A general exception to these rules occurs when your assets are 
passed on to a spouse/common-law partner. Here the tax can 
usually be deferred until the death of the surviving spouse/
common-law partner.
Capital gains and recapture
For income tax purposes you’re considered to have sold all your 
assets at the time of death. (Again, an exception is available when 
property is passed to a spouse/common-law partner.)
The “sale” proceeds are deemed to be the value of the assets at 
your death. The excess of proceeds over the cost is a capital gain 

Part V: Tips for Special Tax Planning Circumstances  
344
of which 50 percent is taxed. If your assets include rental prop-
erties there may also be “recapture” of prior-year depreciation 
claims (or capital cost allowance — CCA in tax lingo; see Tip #32). 
Recapture is fully taxed.
 
The tax liability arising on the deemed capital gains and/or recap-
ture must be funded from other sources. As a “sale” occurred 
strictly for income tax purposes you did not receive any cash to 
pay the tax. In the worst case the estate is forced to sell an asset 
to pay a tax bill. This works against you if one of the objectives of 
your estate (Tip #71) is to keep the cottage in the family after you 
pass on.
RRSPs and RRIFs
On death your registered retirement savings plans (RRSPs) and/or 
registered retirement income funds (RRIFs) are considered dereg-
istered and, unless the beneficiary of your plan is your spouse/
common-law partner, the full value of each plan is included in the 
income reported on your final personal tax return. 
At least most RRSPs and RRIFs provide immediate access to cash, 
to fund the tax liability by having the plan liquidate the holdings. 
However, the remaining value to be passed on to your heirs can be 
dramatically reduced.
Live Rich, Die Poor
Live it up while you’re alive and leave the coffers empty when you 
shuffle off this mortal coil — this is the estate planning motto! A 
proper estate plan will permit you to live the life you deserve, but 
on death you may find you don’t legally own a lot of assets — or 
you’re poor on paper — meaning a low income tax exposure. 
Perfect!
A way to avoid taxes on death would be to rid yourself of all assets 
(including RRSPs and RRIFs) before you die. However, you still 
have to live! Your estate plan must allow you to live comfortably 
until your death and have access to assets you enjoy — like the 
family cottage. You want to ensure you have enough funds to 
live on, and you don’t want to get involved with your children’s 
squabbles over your assets. You also do not want to face a large 
tax liability now. What to do?

345
 #72: Reduce Income Tax at Death
Estate Planning Tools
Although it’s never pleasant to think of our own demise, the 
thought of paying less tax usually brightens our day. In this sec-
tion, we look at a number of ways you can reduce the income tax 
exposure you may have at death. 
Early inheritances to your children 
and grandchildren
If an objective of your estate is to pass assets to your children, 
why not do it now? The kids may prefer some money sooner rather 
than later — especially if they have an outstanding mortgage. 
In passing funds on to your adult children you can do an outright 
gift (a true early inheritance) or you can lend funds and forgive the 
loan on or before death.
Gifts
When you give cash to an adult child no income tax implications 
exist for you, regardless of how the money is used. If you liquidate 
securities to make the cash gift you may incur capital gains, which 
would be subject to tax in the year of liquidation. This tax may be 
lower than on your death, plus you have the cash to pay the tax, 
and moreover your current tax rate may be substantially lower 
than your tax rate in the year of death. (Another thought is that in 
a poor economic market selling may be more attractive in terms 
of reducing your tax on the gain and letting the market “uptick” be 
taxed at a later time in your child’s hands should she re-invest the 
funds you give to her.)
Consider establishing a trust in which you add cash to fund invest-
ments on behalf of your grandchildren. (Don’t be afraid of trusts! 
See Tip #73.) When the grandchildren are under 18 the interest 
or dividends earned on the investments will continue to be taxed 
in your hands. However, any capital gains can be taxed in the 
grandchildren’s hands. Because only 50 percent of capital gains 
are taxed, an individual can have $20,640 of the capital gains and 
pay no income tax thanks to the $10,320 basic personal tax credit 
amount we’re all entitled to. So, here you can reduce the size of 
your estate and reduce the extended family tax bite.
Loans
Rather than giving funds to your adult children, you can make a 
loan. The loan can be set up so it’s forgiven no later than at the 

Part V: Tips for Special Tax Planning Circumstances  
346
time of your death. During your lifetime this offers you some con-
trol as you can “call” the loan. The loan can be interest-free if your 
adult child uses the funds to pay down a mortgage, pay for your 
grandkid’s tuition, fund a vacation, buy a new car, and so on.
 
Should your adult children invest the funds, the income attribution 
rules would have you, not your adult child, pay tax on the invest-
ment income if the funds were lent on an interest-free or a below-
market-rate basis.
Undertake an “estate freeze”
As your assets grow in value so does the tax liability you will face 
on death. As part of your estate plan you can implement steps to 
allow this growth to continue (stock and real estate markets will-
ing, of course) but to not have the growth accrue to your hands. 
This is accomplished by exchanging a “growth asset” for a non-
growth asset.
In doing the exchange this will “freeze” the growth in your 
hands and the tax liability that has accrued as at the time of the 
exchange. The growth of your asset from the time you acquired it 
to the time of the exchange or freeze will be subject to tax, but not 
until your passing.
The growth after the time of the exchange or freeze accrues to 
someone else — your heirs. When the growth accrued to you is 
frozen, so is your tax liability. At the time of the exchange or freeze 
the future tax liability can be estimated and steps can be taken to 
plan for its payment on your death. Often, you can purchase life 
insurance (which we discuss later in this tip); on your death the 
insurance proceeds are used to pay the tax liability, and the estate 
stays intact.
Portfolio of investments
A portfolio of growth investments (stocks, mutual funds, real 
estate, and so on.) can be transferred to a private family owned 
corporation on a tax-free basis. (Well, it’s actually a tax deferral 
because the accrued gain at the time of the transfer will be taxed 
on your death — but not until then!) In return for your portfolio of 
investments you receive preferred shares of the corporation. The 
preferred shares would have a value equal to the value of the port-
folio transferred to the corporation and this value will not grow. 
The value of the preferred shares would be frozen. The preferred 
shares would be voting and dividend paying to allow you to con-
trol the corporation (that is, the decisions concerning the portfolio 
of investments) and to take funds out for living expenses.

347
 #72: Reduce Income Tax at Death
Your heirs, perhaps your children, would subscribe for the 
common shares (or “growth shares”) of the corporation for a 
nominal amount, say $100. The future growth of the investment 
portfolio will accrue to the common shareholders and will be 
taxed in your heirs’ hands when they sell or are deemed to sell the 
common shares of the corporation on their death.
For more on the tax benefits of corporations, see Tip #30.
Family business succession
An estate freeze is a common technique used by family businesses. 
It’s often coupled with passing the business to a second genera-
tion. The common shares, a growth asset, owned by parents, are 
exchanged on a tax-free basis (well, again, tax-deferred as noted 
above) for preferred shares. New common shares are then pur-
chased by the sons and daughters of the second generation. The 
parent’s tax liability is frozen and steps are undertaken to provide 
the funds to pay this liability at death. The preferred shares are 
inherited by the children who become the sole owners of the busi-
ness. The procedure repeats itself when time comes to pass the 
business on to the third generation.
Make charitable donations 
and bequests
In Tip #75, we provide details on the advantages charitable dona-
tions and bequests offer in minimizing income taxes on death 
when they are part of your estate plan. There is tax savings avail-
able when charitable donations are made in your year of death or 
after your death by virtue of a bequest in your will. 
To arrange your affairs to make a bequest, contact the “planned 
giving” department of your favourite charity.
 
If you begin funding a charitable donation to be given on your 
death (say, a life insurance policy), you can receive an official 
receipt for yearly charitable contributions (say, annual life insur-
ance premiums) while you’re alive.
Reduce exposure to U.S. estate tax
In Tip #70 we discuss the implications of dying while owning U.S. 
assets (such as shares of U.S. corporations and real estate located 
in the U.S.) and the potential exposure to U.S. estate tax.

Part V: Tips for Special Tax Planning Circumstances  
348
If you own U.S. assets you can undertake strategies to minimize 
or eliminate the potential U.S. estate tax you may be subject to. 
It’s best to contact a U.S. estate tax specialist for further advice in 
this area.
 
If you’re considering purchasing a U.S. property, see a U.S. estate 
tax specialist before you make the purchase.
Purchase life insurance
Life insurance can be a handy estate planning tool. Life insurance 
itself does not reduce your exposure to income tax on death — 
it’s simply used as a means to fund a tax liability on death so the 
estate does not have to be crippled to pay the tax.
Life insurance is most effective when an estate is quite illiquid — 
say, because the majority of the estate is made up of a cottage or 
other real estate holdings.
 
A life insurance death benefit payment is not taxable.
 
Because life insurance is, in effect, a benefit to your heirs, let them 
pay the annual premiums.
Have a power of attorney
A power of attorney — sometimes called a living will — lets your 
“attorney” make health and financial decisions for you when you 
can’t. We discuss the importance of having an up-to-date power of 
attorney in Tip #76.
Make sure your will is up to date
We consider this the last step in your estate plan because you 
need to visit all the other estate planning steps first. In other 
words, your will is done after you’ve decided on the objectives of 
your estate and implemented strategies to meet these objectives 
while at the same time minimizing your tax and probate exposure. 
(We discuss probate exposure in Tip #74).

Use Trusts in Your Tax 
and Estate Planning
T
rust us — a trust is not solely for the old or rich, overly com-
plex, a “tax scam,” or exorbitantly expensive to set up or main-
tain. A trust can be a very effective tax and estate planning tool, as 
we cover in this tip.
Understanding What a Trust Is
A trust is an arrangement that separates control and legal own-
ership of an asset from its actual beneficial ownership. In plain 
English, this means the asset is owned and controlled by someone 
other than the person(s) that benefits from the asset (say, in the 
form of income and/or capital gains derived from the asset).
Here’s an example of a trust. The parents of a very young child die but 
leave funds (perhaps via life insurance) to care for the child. Because 
the child is so young it’s not prudent to give the funds directly to the 
child. Therefore, an arrangement is set up (a trust) where the funds 
are made available to the child (the beneficiary) but control of these 
funds rests with others (the trustees) to ensure the funds are pru-
dently saved and spent. The trustees have a legal duty to ensure the 
funds are used properly and solely for the benefit of the child.
For income tax purposes a trust is a separate taxpayer. A trust 
must file its own special tax return (a “T3 income tax return” 
versus a “T1 income tax return” an individual files) if it has income, 
and it may or may not be required to pay income taxes. Where the 
trust has a lower tax rate than the trust beneficiary(ies) it makes 
sense to have the trust pay the tax. Where the beneficiary(ies) 
of the trust is subject to tax at a rate lower than the trust then 
best to have the trust allocate its income and capital gains to the 
beneficiary(ies) so they would be subject to tax and not the trust.
 
A trust can be used for many other reasons other than tax plan-
ning, including the following: 
 
✓ Avoiding family disputes
 
✓ Assisting in managing another’s affairs

Part V: Tips for Special Tax Planning Circumstances  
350
 
✓ Controlling children’s money
 
✓ Providing for a child’s education and/or special needs
 
✓ Providing for the succession of a family business
A trust arrangement is documented in a trust agreement, which 
is drafted by a lawyer. Unlike when a company is incorporated, a 
trust agreement does not require government approval to be set 
up. A trust agreement remains a private document.
The trust agreement will note the trust’s name (say, the Jones 
Family Trust) as well as the names and powers of the trustees. 
The trustees can be given strict guidelines on how the trust is to 
be run and which beneficiaries get what and when, or — as is the 
case with most modern trusts — the trustees are given discretion 
in terms of managing the trust assets and distributing income to 
the beneficiaries. 
Getting to Know Who’s 
Involved in a Trust
A trust requires the involvement of three people. We introduce you 
to these fine folks in this section.
Settlor
The person who sells or gifts assets (i.e., investments, money) to 
a trust is the trust settlor. Usually, the settlor’s “job” is complete 
after the trust is settled. A settlor of a trust can be a parent who 
wishes to pass on assets to children. 
 
The settlor cannot be able to have the trust property returned to 
him- or herself. If so, the trust will be considered “reversionary” 
and the tax benefits expected from the trust will not be available.
The sale or gift of assets to a trust is considered a disposition for 
tax purposes. If the asset has an accrued capital gain, it could trig-
ger a tax liability. However, this tax may be less than the tax liabil-
ity that occurs later in life, or at death. (A capital gain will not arise 
where assets are transferred to a trust that is a spousal, alter-ego, 
or joint spousal/partner trust. We discuss these trusts near the 
end of this tip.)

351
 #73: Use Trusts in Your Tax and Estate Planning
Beneficiaries
The individual or individuals who will reap the rewards from the 
trust assets are the “beneficial owners.” Often children are benefi-
ciaries of a trust, especially if they are under 18. The future apprecia-
tion in the trust assets will be taxed in the trust or the beneficiaries’ 
hands and not the settlor’s hands. This is of great advantage where 
the settlor is at a higher tax rate than the beneficiaries.
Trustees
Trustees manage or control the trust assets on behalf of the ben-
eficiaries. This permits a parent to minimize a potential tax liability 
without giving assets directly to a child who, at least in the eyes of 
the parents, may not act responsibly.
Investigating Common Trusts
Trusts fall into two categories: testamentary and inter-vivos (or 
living) trusts. A testamentary trust is created on the death of a 
settlor, and a living trust is created while the settlor is still alive 
(hence the name). Each category of trust is taxed differently. In 
this section, we take a look at the most common types of testamen-
tary and inter-vivos trusts, and explain when they’re best used for 
reducing taxes and/or other purposes.
Inter-vivos income-splitting trust
The term income splitting — or, as it’s sometimes called, income 
sharing or income shifting — is used to describe the plans or steps 
taken to shift income from a higher-tax-rate family member to a 
lower-tax-rate family member. The family income remains the same 
but the family income tax burden is decreased, leaving more after-
tax income for family living expenses. (We discuss the tax savings 
available with income splitting in Tip #50, and look at CPP sharing 
and pension splitting in Tip #68.)
The idea here is that parents transfer investments to a trust in 
which the children are beneficiaries. The income earned on the 
investments is then taxed in the children’s hands. Because the chil-
dren are expected to be in a lower tax bracket than the parents, 
the family is better off on an after-tax basis.
Working against this objective are the income tax provisions called 
the “attribution rules.” These rules essentially state that no matter 

Part V: Tips for Special Tax Planning Circumstances  
352
who receives the income, it’s taxed in the hands of the person 
who made or funded the investment. In other words, the income 
earned on the investment asset is “attributed” to the individual 
who funded the investment. However, there are exceptions to the 
attribution rules:
 
✓ Attribution of interest or dividends occurs only if the child 
beneficiary is under 18. Therefore, no attribution occurs when 
the beneficiaries are adult children.
 
✓ No attribution of “income on income” applies. Interest and 
dividends earned on the reinvestment of interest and divi-
dends does not attribute.
 
✓ No attribution of capital gains applies. Because only 50 per-
cent of capital gains are taxed, a trust beneficiary could be 
subject to tax on $20,640 of capital gains in 2009 but pay no 
tax because of the $10,320 basic personal tax credit amount 
available to all individuals.
 
✓ No attribution of interest and dividends applies, even when 
the beneficiaries are children under 18, where funds are loaned, 
rather than gifted, to the trust. The loan must be made at a 
market rate of interest and the interest on the loan must be 
paid within 30 days of the end of each calendar year. The indi-
vidual lending the funds — say, a parent — would include the 
interest received in his or her personal taxable income and 
the trust would deduct the interest costs in determining its 
taxable income because the interest is being incurred to earn 
income. (We discuss the deductibility of interest in Tip #47.)
 
✓ For this strategy to work effectively in shifting income from a 
parent to a child, the trust assets need to have an investment 
return greater then the interest rate on the loan.
Testamentary spousal trust
As this trust is “testamentary” it is created by a will. On death, 
the assets of the deceased are transferred to a spousal trust on a 
tax-free basis. The trust must permit only the surviving spouse/
common-law partner to receive the income of the trust assets until 
his or her death. A spousal trust has three main advantages: 
 
✓ Just as with assets bequeathed directly to a spouse/common-
law partner, the deceased spouse/partner on death does not 
face capital gains and the associated income tax in respect of 
assets transferred to a spousal trust on death. The income tax 
on the accrued capital gains on the assets of the deceased is 
deferred until the death of the surviving spouse/common-law 
partner.

353
 #73: Use Trusts in Your Tax and Estate Planning
 
✓ Like any trust, it has trustees to manage it. Where the spouse/
common-law partner of the deceased has little financial expe-
rience this permits an element of control.
 
✓ A testamentary spousal trust is taxed at the same tax rates as 
an individual. Therefore, the same graduated rates apply. This 
permits tax savings when the spouse/common-law partner of 
the deceased is taxed at a higher tax bracket than the trust. 
Therefore, less tax, more funds for the surviving spouse/
common-law partner.
Multiple testamentary 
non-spousal trusts
Like a spousal trust, these trusts are taxed at graduated tax rates. 
The beneficiaries are often children. Separate trusts are created 
(usually one per child) as opposed to one trust. This allows to the 
tax savings of the graduated levels of tax to be multiplied. We dis-
cuss this in Tip #76 in the context of choosing your heirs.
Alter-ego and joint spousal/partner 
inter-vivos trusts
You need to be at least 65 to establish these trusts. Assets can be 
transferred to these trusts without triggering income tax on the 
accrued capital gain at the time of transfer. In the case of an alter-
ego trust the tax on the accrued gain is deferred until your death. 
Where a joint spousal/partner trust is used the tax can be deferred 
until the death of the second spouse/common law partner.
Use of these trusts don’t decrease your income taxes at death (or 
on the death of your spouse/common-law partner) but these trusts 
work extremely well to minimize your probate exposure on death 
(see Tip #74).
These trusts also have other advantages:
 
✓ They can serve as a will substitute: Because the assets are 
in a trust they are not part of your estate and do not pass to 
your heirs as the result of a will. The assets will pass accord-
ing to the trust agreement. Compulsory succession rules can 
be avoided. These assets are not subject to a will that could 
be contested.

Part V: Tips for Special Tax Planning Circumstances  
354
 
✓ They can enhance privacy: A probated will is a public docu-
ment. Using these trusts prevents the public from knowing 
the value of your estate and who your beneficiaries are.
 
✓ They can serve as a power of attorney substitute: Co-trustees 
or successor trustees can act on your behalf if you become 
unable to manage the assets of the trust. A power of attorney 
(see Tip #76) is not needed for assets owned by a trust.

Reduce Probate 
Fees at Death
P
robate is a court certificate (“letters probate” or similar) that 
validates a will and confirms the executor named is autho-
rized to deal with your assets after your death. Most financial insti-
tutions will not release assets of the deceased to the beneficiaries 
of the will until they are provided with letters probate.
Probate fees (or, “probate tax”) — or “estate administration tax” 
(the modern name) — are the cost of obtaining letters probate. 
Ontario, British Columbia, and Nova Scotia have the highest pro-
bate fees in the country.
Probate fees are based on the value of the assets in the estate. 
Obviously, the lower the value of the estate subject to probate the 
lower the probate fee. In this tip, we look at some ways you can 
organize your affairs now to reduce your probate exposure later.
Understanding the Relationship 
between Probate Fees and 
Income Taxes
Generally, planning for income tax minimization has priority over 
the planning for probate minimization — especially because pro-
bate fees in many of the provinces and territories are not a signifi-
cant cost. (Table 74-1 breaks down the probate fees for Canada.) In 
other words, do not let the “probate planning tail” wag the “income 
tax planning dog”.
Sometimes conflict can occur between a recommended income tax 
strategy and a probate plan. Again, it’s often best to go with the tax 
idea and accept that the probate fee be paid. 

Part V: Tips for Special Tax Planning Circumstances  
356
An example of where probate planning is less important than 
income tax planning is the home you live in, which may be exposed 
to probate on your death. However, you want to ensure that if you 
undertake steps to avoid this you do not lose the potential princi-
pal residence exemption (see Tip #46) to shelter the income tax on 
the capital gain that can arise on death. (We discuss the potential 
income taxes you can have on death in Tip #72.)
Determining Whether Probate 
Will Be Required
Not every will needs to be probated. Whether your will needs to 
be subject to the probate process will depend on what assets are 
involved, the legal ownership of the assets, and the custodian of 
the assets at the time of your death.
Assets that don’t usually require probate include personal 
and household effects, vehicles, and life insurance proceeds. 
Additionally, as we discuss in the next section, the following assets 
can also be excluded from the probate fee calculation: 
 
✓ RRSPs, RRIFs, and TFSAs with a designated beneficiary 
 
✓ Shares of a private corporation, and
 
✓ Assets owned jointly
Without planning, if some of your assets are subject to probate 
then all of your assets can be subject to probate. So it’s important 
to separate your assets between those subject to probate and those 
not. (We cover just how to do that in the remainder of this tip.)
 
Talk to a lawyer and the custodian of your assets (perhaps the 
financial institution holding your investments) to find out who will 
request to see letters probate and on what assets.
Reducing your Estate 
Subject to Probate
In this section we comment on a number of strategies you can use 
(perhaps in combination) to reduce the value of your estate that 
will be subject to probate. 

357
 #74: Reduce Probate Fees at Death
Designate a beneficiary of your 
RRSPs, RRIFs, and TFSAs
When a beneficiary is noted in the documentation of these plans, 
upon your death the funds will flow directly to the designated 
beneficiary. The funds do not first go into the estate and then out 
to the beneficiary. Because these funds do not become part of the 
estate, no applicable probate fee applies.
Own assets jointly
When you own assets jointly, say with a spouse/common-law 
partner or an adult child, the asset will pass directly to the joint 
owner(s) on your death. Again, because the assets do not first go 
into the estate, the asset is not included in the value of the assets 
on which the probate fee is calculated.
Transfer assets to an alter-ego 
or joint spousal/partner trust
When you’re 65, you can transfer your assets to an alter-ego trust. 
Or, if you have a spouse/common-law partner, you can make use of 
a joint spousal/partner trust. (Refer to Tip #73 for an explanation 
of these types of trusts.) The assets remain under your control, 
and all the income and capital gains they generate is taxed in the 
same way as without using the trust — both while you’re alive 
and on death. Should you transfer a home to one of these trusts, 
the principal residence exemption continues to be available. The 
transfer of the assets to these types of trusts does not trigger a tax 
liability because the assets are considered “sold” to the trust at a 
value equal to the tax cost of the assets.
Because upon death the “legal” owner of the assets is a trust — 
and not you — the assets will not be part of your estate and, again, 
not subject to probate. The assets pass to your intended benefi-
ciaries by virtue of the trust document and not by your will. Of 
course, the trust and the will beneficiaries can be the same if you 
wish. We discuss trusts and how they may fit into your income tax 
and estate planning ideas in Tip #73.

Part V: Tips for Special Tax Planning Circumstances  
358
Transfer assets to a family 
owned private corporation 
 (a holding company)
To transfer your shares of a private corporation to your heirs 
on your death it is expected that the directors of the private cor-
poration would not request to see letters probate to approve the 
transfer.
A financial institution, such as an investment management com-
pany responsible for holding the corporation’s portfolio of market-
able securities, would not request letters probate in this instance 
as no impact occurs on the investments held by the corporation. 
The investments continue to be held by the same owner — the 
private corporation. A corporation does not “die.” (For more on 
corporations, check out Tip #30.)
You can transfer investments and other assets to a corporation 
without triggering a tax liability provided the proper income tax 
election is documented and filed with the CRA. (We touch on this 
briefly in Tip #72 regarding undertaking an “estate freeze.”)
Have two wills
Draft up two wills: one that covers the assets subject to probate 
and another for the assets that are not subject to probate.
A common probate plan for an individual with the majority of his 
or her wealth in investments is to transfer the investments to a 
private corporation or “holding company”. (Again, we touched on 
this in Tip #72 in connection with carryout an “estate freeze.”)
In consideration for the investments the individual receives back 
shares of the holding company. A will is prepared that solely 
addresses the shares of the holding company held by the individ-
ual. A second will is prepared to cover all the other assets owned 
by the individual.
On death, the second will may need to be probated. However, the 
value of the estate represented by this will is minimal because 
the bulk of the individual’s wealth is represented by the first will, 
which does not need to be subject to the probate process. The 
probate fee will be based solely on the second will, which may rep-
resent a very small portion of the individual’s full estate.

Make Charitable Donations 
Part of Your Estate Plan
I
n Tip #71 we discuss the whys and whats of estate planning, 
and we extend our discussion to the hows of estate planning in 
Tips #72 to #74. In this tip, we carry on the “how” theme to show 
you how charitable donations can assist in your estate planning.
A lot of estate planning deals with the preservation of the wealth 
you’ve generated during your lifetime. Depending on your financial 
position, you — or perhaps your spouse/common-law partner, 
should they outlive you — could face a significant income tax bill 
on death. One of the ways to reduce this tax bill, and maybe to 
meet other objectives of your estate plan too, is to make charitable 
donations in the year of your death, at the time of your death and 
after your death.
Charitable Donations Made 
in the Year of Death
In Tip #9 we note that the maximum amount of charitable dona-
tions you can claim in a year is restricted to 75 percent of the net 
income figure reported on line 236 of your tax return. However, in 
the year a person dies this limit is 100 percent of the person’s net 
income. Moreover, if the donations exceed the 100 percent limit in 
the year of death the excess donations can be carried back to the 
previous year to be claimed. The donation restriction for that year 
is retroactively increased to 100 percent. To use this provision, an 
adjustment request (CRA form T1ADJ “T1 Adjustment Request) to 
that year’s return is sent to the CRA.

Part V: Tips for Special Tax Planning Circumstances  
360
Include Charitable Donations 
in Your Will
If you want donations to be made to charities on and/or after your 
death you can set this up in your will. Simply include a clause in 
your will stating that specific charities are to receive certain dollar 
amounts. Alternatively, a charity can be a full or partial beneficiary 
of your estate. In this case, the amount the charity will receive is 
not known until the estate has made its final distribution.
 
Where funds are donated to a registered charity or charitable foun-
dation by virtue of a will, the tax credit can be claimed on the final 
personal tax return of the deceased— no matter the timing of the 
donation This is very advantageous as the final personal tax return 
of the deceased can have a significant income tax liability. (The 
potential for income tax at death is discussed in Tip #72.)
Donate RRSPs, RRIFs, TFSAs, and 
Life Insurance to Charities
You can name a registered charity or charitable foundation as the 
beneficiary of an RRSP, RRIF, TFSA, or insurance policy and obtain 
a tax credit for the donation in the year of death. Where the benefi-
ciary is stated in the documentation of the plans — rather than in 
a will — you can reduce the probate exposure of your estate. We 
discuss probate, also called estate administration tax, in Tip #74.
 
When a gift of a life insurance policy is made, it may also be pos-
sible to claim the insurance premiums as charitable donations as 
they are paid in the years while you are alive.

361
#76
Prepare a Power of 
Attorney and a Will
C
ertainty.
The main reason for having an up to date power of attorney and 
will is simply to ensure that you and your assets are efficiently 
handled in the exact way you wish and that those left with the task 
are trustworthy and have your best interests at heart.
In this tip we focus on the completion of your estate planning. 
Here, we detail the merits of allowing another to act for you when 
the need may arise and to ensure your estate wishes are clearly 
communicated to your heirs.
When your plans and intentions are written down it means not 
only that you can relax, but also that your family can too. Everyone 
is aware that things are in place when needed, both while you’re 
alive and on your death.
Your Power of Attorney
The benefit of having a will (which we discuss below) is well rec-
ognized in that it ensures your wishes are met on and after death. 
However, for a will to come into play, well, you have to, ahem, die. 
If you become incapable of making decisions while you are alive, a 
power of attorney will allow someone you trust to make decisions 
on your behalf and in your best interests. 
Simply put, in designating someone to be your power of attorney 
you are authorizing them to act for you as your “agent” to deal 
with decisions that you need to make but may be unable to do so.
 
The “attorney” in “power of attorney” does not need to be a 
lawyer. However, you’re best off having a lawyer draft your power 
of attorney for you. 

Part V: Tips for Special Tax Planning Circumstances  
362
 
Ensure your power of attorney is up to date, and redo it any time 
your selected attorney should become unable to act as such.
You can have two separate powers of attorney: 
 
✓ A power of attorney for property: Actually, what you want 
is to have a “continuing” or “enduring” power of attorney 
for property. Having the power of attorney be continuing or 
enduring allows the power of attorney to continue should you 
become mentally incapable. This power of attorney allows 
someone to act for you while you’re mentally competent, and 
also when you’re not.
 
✓ If there are income tax decisions, elections, returns to be com-
pleted, signed and filed to take advantage of the tips in this 
book the person having your the power of attorney can see to it 
that all these tasks are completed to benefit you and your heirs.
 
✓ A power of attorney for personal care: Here, the power of 
attorney only has “power” when you’re incapable of making 
personal care decisions such as medical treatment, the 
decision to move to a nursing home, nutrition, hygiene, and 
the like.
Your Will
The writing (or updating) of your will should be one of the last, if 
not the last, steps in implementing your estate plan. It’s time to 
look at your will after you’ve completed the earlier estate planning 
steps (as detailed in Tips #71 to #75) of deciding on the objectives 
of your estate and have implemented the ways the objectives are 
to be met — early inheritance gifts, planned giving to charities, 
transferring assets to a corporation, purchasing life insurance, 
designating beneficiaries of your RRSPs, RRIFs, and TFSAs, owning 
assets jointly, use of trusts, and so on. In drafting your will you 
must consider each asset that is to become part of your estate.
 
Although you may be tempted to use a will kit as an inexpensive 
way to prepare a will, we don’t recommend it. Working with a 
lawyer will ensure that your will is tailored to your needs and that 
all of your assets are considered.
 
Have an accountant look at a draft version of your will before you 
“go final.” (No, we are not looking for work here!) Your lawyer 
may be great on estate law and the necessary wording of a will 
but he or she may not be up on the tax and estate planning strate-
gies available to you, your spouse/common-law partner, and your 
family.

363
 #76: Prepare a Power of Attorney and a Will
 
If you die without a will — called dying intestate — it will be stressful 
for those you leave behind. Transferring your assets can be costly, 
and there will be delays. You have no control on who looks after 
your affairs, nor can you ensure your assets will end up as you 
wished — or even whether all assets you own have been consid-
ered. Don’t die without a will!
Making a trust the beneficiary 
of your will
Many wills provide for the individual’s wish to bequeath all his or 
her assets to a spouse/common-law partner, and that should the 
individual outlive the spouse/common-law partner, the assets are 
to be passed on to adult children. The will of the other spouse/
common-law partner would read the same. The estate objective is 
that the assets “stay in the family” — the assets first move to the sur-
viving spouse/common-law partner and then to the adult children.
 
You can ensure your assets stay within your family and reduce 
the post-death income tax burden through the use of a trust. As 
we note in Tip #73, testamentary spousal trusts and multiple non-
spousal testamentary trusts can be created in will. The advantage 
is that the trusts are taxed as a separate taxpayer and the income 
is subject to tax at the same graduated rates as individuals are. 
And where the tax rate of the trust is lower than the tax rate of the 
estate beneficiary, an opportunity exists for tax savings!
Instead of making your spouse/common-law partner the benefi-
ciary of your estate, consider using a testamentary spousal trust. 
Continuing, should you outlive your spouse/common-law partner, 
then have your assets go to a number of testamentary trusts — 
say, a separate trust where the beneficiary is a different adult 
child. Again, your objective for your assets to first pass to your 
spouse/common-law partner and then to your adult children has 
been met (plus there is the potential to minimize the tax on future 
investment income)... Remember, the beneficiaries of each trust 
are entitled to the trust assets.
Reviewing and updating your will
 
Review your will periodically — every five years at least, and also 
at times when a major change occurs in your life circumstances, 
including the following:

Part V: Tips for Special Tax Planning Circumstances  
364
 
✓ Divorce 
 
✓ Death of a spouse/common-law partner
 
✓ Second marriage 
 
✓ Illness
 
✓ Child/grandchild becoming disabled
 
✓ Children getting married
 
✓ Children with marital concerns
All of these twists in life will likely cause you to revisit your estate 
objectives, perhaps change your current estate planning tech-
niques, and alter your will.

Top Ten Year-Round 
Tax-Saving Strategies
I
n this tip we run through our “greatest hits” — our top ten most 
effective tax-saving strategies. If you’re employing all these 
strategies you get an A+ from us tax nerds for having your taxes 
managed all year long!
Open a TFSA
The (now not so) new tax-free savings account (TFSA), launched 
January 1, 2009, is the ideal place to put up to $5,000 of savings 
and earn tax-free income and/or gains for life. Withdrawals aren’t 
taxed, don’t negatively affect your eligibility for government-tested 
benefits, and can be re-contributed the following calendar year. 
(See Tip #41 for more.)
Maximize Your RRSP Contributions
Take advantage of one of the last great tax shelters. An RRSP is 
an arrangement that allows you to save for your retirement on a 
tax-friendly basis. Funds you contribute are not taxed until you 
withdraw them. The maximum contribution you can make for 2010 
is $22,000; for 2011 onward the amount is indexed. (Check out Tip 
#42 for more info.)
Set Up a Spousal RRSP
The primary benefit of a spousal RRSP is that funds withdrawn can 
generally be taxed in the hands of a lower-income spouse. (Again, 
Tip #42 has the scoop on contributing to RRSPs.)

Part VI: The Part of Tens  
368
Think about Opening an RDSP 
for a Disabled Person
If you or someone you care about has a disability, consider open-
ing up a registered disability savings plan (RDSP). Contributions to 
RDSPs, limited to $200,000 over the disabled beneficiary’s lifetime, 
may be augmented by up to $90,000 in Canada Disability Savings 
grants and bonds. (Tip #63 has more on RDSPs.)
Earn Tax-Efficient Investment 
Income
If you’ve maxed out your TFSA and RRSP contributions, consider 
tax-efficient investment income outside these tax-sheltered plans 
by investing in Canadian dividends, which are eligible for the divi-
dend tax credit (Tip #34), and capital gains, which are only half 
taxable (Tip #38).
Open Up RESPs for Your Kids
Don’t forget to make at least $2,500 of contributions to each child’s 
registered education savings plan (RESP) this year to take advan-
tage of the $500 Canada Education Savings Grant. You may also be 
able to catch up on missed CESGs from prior years. (Get schooled 
about RESPs in Tip #51.)
Explore Pension Splitting
If you’ve received pension income in the year, be sure to investi-
gate whether splitting up to half that income with your spouse or 
partner makes sense when you file your tax return. (Tip #68 will 
help you make that decision.)
Consider Income Splitting
A spousal income-splitting strategy (which we cover in Tip #50) — 
where the higher-income spouse or partner loans funds to the 
lower-income spouse or partner to invest — may be ideal given 
the record low prescribed interest rate, which is currently set 
at 1 percent. 

369
 #77: Top Ten Year-Round Tax-Saving Strategies
Donate “In Kind” to Charity
When planning your charitable giving for the year, consider donat-
ing appreciated securities directly to your charity of choice. 
You get a tax receipt for the full value of the securities that you 
donated and pay no tax on any accrued capital gains. (Tip #10 has 
what you’re after.)
Plan Now to Avoid a Tax Refund 
If you regularly get a large tax refund each spring — say, because 
you’re eligible for the child tax credit; see Tip #49 — consider 
applying for a reduction of tax at source using CRA form T1213. 
(You’ll need to complete the form each year.)

Top Ten Ways to Reduce 
the Risk of a CRA Audit
W
hat are the two most dreaded words in the English lan-
guage? Okay — aside from “root canal.” For many it’s “tax 
audit.” Chances are if you’re reading this chapter you’re looking 
for ways to reduce your risk of getting anything other than a thank 
you note — called a Notice of Assessment in tax speak — from 
the CRA.
If you do happen to receive something more than a Notice of 
Assessment in the mail — perhaps a request for more information — 
the first line of defence is to avoid breaking out in a sweat. You see, 
you should understand that there’s a difference between an audit 
and a request for more information — also called a “verification 
procedure.” The CRA may ask to see confirmation of receipts that 
don’t have to be sent with your return, such as childcare expenses 
and tuition, but that’s not an audit. In fact, most individuals are 
never audited; they simply receive requests for additional informa-
tion. Here are ten pointers to help you avoid becoming CRA’s next 
audit target.
Audit Your Own Return
Make sure you double check your return before you send it in. 
Check first for mathematical accuracy. Make your life easy and use 
tax software or an online service to ensure your numbers add up 
properly. Also check you’ve included all relevant information (like 
your SIN and address). Avoiding simple mistakes is the first step in 
keeping the CRA from reviewing your return more closely.
Report All Your Income
Make sure you’ve reported all your income, including interest and 
dividends from all your accounts. If you forgot something, you can 
be sure the taxman will eventually find it. You see, the CRA gets a 
copy of all the information slips you receive and they cross check 
them by computer to make sure everything is reported. One handy 

371
 #78: Top Ten Ways to Reduce the Risk of a CRA Audit
tip is to compare this year’s return to last year’s to ensure you 
haven’t missed anything.
Have a Reasonable Expectation 
of Profit
Be careful if you run your own business and are reporting a loss 
on this year’s return. To claim these losses, you must be running 
your business with a reasonable expectation of profit. If not, these 
losses can be denied. The tax collector only flags your return the 
first year you report business losses, but if you continue to report 
losses for the next two or three years you should expect to hear 
from the CRA. Avoiding recurring losses can be as easy as reducing 
your largest expense over time, which, if you own your own busi-
ness, is usually interest expense. Pay down your loans as diligently 
as possible and prepare a forecast to be able to show the taxman 
how you expect to earn a profit.
File Your Tax Return
Some people argue that the only way to ensure your tax return 
doesn’t get audited is simply not to file a tax return at all. After all, 
the CRA can’t audit what isn’t there. To these people we say — try 
again. In fact, every year CRA sends out countless letters to indi-
viduals asking that they file a return — proof the taxman knows 
who these people are. Non-filers risk not only getting caught and 
getting hit with interest and penalties, but also going to jail. In 
addition, if the CRA has to ask you to file a return we can guarantee 
they’ll have a closer look at it when you finally do. So make sure 
you file every year — ON TIME! And if you’ve been a non-filer in the 
past remember it’s never too late to make things right.
Be Consistent with Your Expenses
Claims for expense deductions must be reasonable, and the 
expenses must be incurred to earn income. This means that 
claiming your personal expenses not only is a bad idea — it’s not 
allowed under our tax law. If you own your own business, make 
sure your expenses are consistent from year to year. Of course you 
must still be able to support expenses claimed, but a significant 
jump in meals and entertainment or travel costs may just catch the 
taxman’s eye.

Part VI: The Part of Tens  
372
Don’t Cheat
Sounds simple enough, right? Well, those of you who are tempted 
to cheat should be aware that the taxman has ways of tracking you 
down. The CRA has identified industries that have, in the past, had 
a higher incidence of cheaters, including construction, subcontrac-
tors, unregistered vehicle sales, auto repair, direct sales, childcare, 
cleaning, and restaurants. If you’re in one of these industries don’t 
be offended by our comments. You’re probably above board with 
your tax filings! But not everyone is — and we wanted you to know 
you’re more likely to hear from the CRA.
Some of you like to voice your opinions on blogs and various other 
online forums — and that’s fine. But be aware that the CRA may 
be paying attention to your online musings. If the taxman takes 
notice of your comments he may just check your tax filings to 
close the loop.
Think Twice about Taking 
Cash Under the Table
Many people think that taking cash payments for services will get 
them out of paying tax. What the taxman doesn’t know won’t hurt 
him — right? Don’t be so sure. There is no shortage of Canadians 
who are willing to quietly report you for offering your services 
on a cash basis. In one instance we’re aware of, a business owner 
offered a customer services at a discount if he paid cash. Unfortu-
nately the customer worked for CRA. Ouch! The business owner’s 
tax affairs we’re examined and he was eventually reassessed for 
years of underreported income plus interest and penalties.
Learn from Your Mistakes
If you’re caught cheating, it’s almost guaranteed the CRA will look 
at that particular item again the next year. Suppose, for example, 
that you receive a request to substantiate your childcare expenses, 
and find that — by accident or design — you’ve overstated your 
expenses. You can be sure the CRA will ask you to submit your 
receipts the next time around — perhaps even for the next couple 
of years. The moral of the story? You have absolutely no excuse 
for getting caught making the same mistake twice.

 #78: Top Ten Ways to Reduce the Risk of a CRA Audit
Don’t Give the Taxman 
Something to Audit
Some tax returns have very little worth auditing. An employee with 
one T4 slip has less chance of being audited than a self-employed 
person with significant expenses. The CRA likes to flag the more 
risky items to get more bang, so to speak, for its time spent assess-
ing. Items such as losses from tax shelters, significant interest 
deductions, rental or business losses, and clergy residence deduc-
tions (believe it or not) have an increased likelihood of being 
flagged for an audit. These deductions may be legitimate, but if you 
choose to complicate your tax affairs by reporting deductions that 
can be higher risk be sure you have the information necessary to 
back up your claim — just in case the taxman comes knocking.
Keep Your Fingers Crossed
Even if you do everything right on your returns you may be 
selected for an audit or receive a request for information because 
of just plain old bad luck. Each year the CRA selects taxpayers at 
random, and uses the results of these audits or requests to deter-
mine where people make the most mistakes and in which areas 
people most often cheat. So even if you’ve crossed all your t’s 
and dotted your i’s, you may still receive an unwelcome letter in 
the mail on CRA stationery. Don’t assume you’ve done anything 
wrong — just be sure you can prove you did it right.
