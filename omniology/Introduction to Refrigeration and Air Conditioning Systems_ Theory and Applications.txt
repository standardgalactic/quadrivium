ABSTRACT
This text provides background information, description, and analysis of four major cooling sys-
tem technologies—vapor compression cooling, evaporative cooling, absorption cooling, and gas
cooling. Vapor compression systems are currently the primary technology used in most standard
domestic, commercial, and industrial cooling applications, as they have both performance and
economic advantages over the other competing cooling systems. However, there are many other
applications in which evaporative cooling, absorption cooling, or gas cooling technologies are a
preferred choice.
The main focus of the text is on the application of the thermal sciences to refrigeration
and air conditioning systems. The goals are to familiarize the reader with cooling technology
nomenclature, and provide insight into how refrigeration and air conditioning systems can be
modeled and analyzed. Cooling systems are inherently complex, as the second law of thermo-
dynamics does not allow thermal energy to be transferred directly from a lower temperature to
a higher temperature, so the heat transfer is done indirectly through a thermodynamic cycle.
Emphasis is placed on constructing idealized thermodynamic cycles to represent actual
physical situations in cooling systems. The text also contains numerous practical examples to
show how one can calculate the performance of cooling system components. By becoming fa-
miliar with the analyses presented in the examples, one can gain a feel for the the representative
values of the various thermal and mechanical parameters that characterize cooling systems.

INTRODUCTION
This text provides background information, description, and analysis of four major cooling
technologies—vapor compression cooling, evaporative cooling, absorption cooling, and gas
cooling. Vapor compression systems are currently the primary technology used in most stan-
dard domestic, commercial, and industrial cooling applications, as they have both performance
and economic advantages over the other competing cooling systems. However, there are many
other applications in which evaporative cooling, absorption cooling, or gas cooling technologies
are a preferred choice.
Cooling technologies are generally divided into air conditioning and refrigeration applica-
tions. Air conditioning technologies are deﬁned as those that are used for to maintain acceptable
thermal comfort conditions for people and equipment in residential, commercial, and industrial
buildings and spaces, typically in the neighborhood of 20–30ıC. Refrigeration technologies are
deﬁned as those that are used to maintain temperatures near or below freezing (0ıC) for safe
storage of perishable items such as food and medicine, and operation of low temperature labo-
ratory equipment .
For the most part, the vapor compression and absorption technologies can be used for
either air conditioning and refrigeration applications by simply changing the temperature of the
refrigerant in the evaporator and the condenser. The evaporation and and gas cooling technolo-
gies are primarily used for air conditioning applications.
The main focus of the text is on the application of the thermal sciences to refrigeration
and air conditioning systems. The goals are to familiarize the reader with cooling technology
nomenclature, and provide insight into how refrigeration and air conditioning systems can be

Finally, Chapter 4 provides detailed information and analysis of the heat exchangers, pumps,

The text contains numerous practical examples to show how one can calculate the per-
formance of cooling system components. By becoming familiar with the analyses presented in
the examples, one can gain a feel for the the representative values of the various thermal and
mechanical parameters that characterize cooling systems.
1.1.1
COOLING TECHNOLOGIES
Cooling technologies take advantage of both the sensible heat and the latent heat of a working
ﬂuid. Sensible heat transfer is determined by the property deﬁned as speciﬁc heat as that repre-
sents the energy (4.18 kJ/kg-K for water) needed to increase or decrease an object’s temperature
without changing it’s thermodynamic phase. Latent heat transfer is determined by the property
deﬁned as the heat of vaporization or fusion ( 2230 kJ/kg for water) as that represents the energy
needed for a phase change from a solid to a ﬂuid phase or from a ﬂuid to a gas phase. The melt-
ing of a block of ice will require heat transfer from another body producing a cooling eﬀect on
that body. Likewise, the evaporation of a ﬂuid will require heat transfer from another body, also
producing a cooling eﬀect. Latent heat transfer is used directly in evaporative cooling systems
and in the evaporator and condenser components of vapor compression systems.
A mechanical vapor compression cycle uses evaporation of a refrigerant or working ﬂuid
to produce a net cooling eﬀect. There are many choices for the refrigerant in vapor compression
cycles. The major requirement is that the ﬂuid thermal properties match the requirements of the
given application. There is a narrow temperature range for vaporization and for condensation,
and the refrigerant should also have a relatively high heat of vaporization.
Other important considerations are global warming potential, ﬂammability, toxicity, sta-
bility, cost, lubricant and materials compatibility, and environmental impact. With the onset of
increased climate change due to greenhouse gas emissions, there has been an impetus to transi-
tion to alternative refrigerants, since the halocarbon refrigerants currently used are greenhouse
gases with high global warming potentials. We are on pace for about 4ıC of warming by the end
of the century unless we reduce our greenhouse gas and CO2 emissions. As will be discussed
later, there is no “perfect” refrigerant, and the choice for a particular application will necessarily
involve compromises.
An absorption cycle uses external heating of the working ﬂuid to produce a cooling eﬀect.
The system components are more complex, thus more expensive, in an absorption system relative
to a vapor compression system, so absorption systems are used mainly in large industrial and
commercial building applications and in situations where electricity is not available, such as
vacation homes, mobile homes and trailers. There are two working ﬂuids in an absorption cycle,

1.2. BRIEF HISTORY OF COOLING TECHNOLOGIES

an absorbent, and a refrigerant. The absorption cycle uses the solubility of the refrigerant gas in
the absorbent liquid to reduce the pumping energy required to compress the refrigerant.
Evaporative cooling is used when low humidity air is available, and can be cooled by the
evaporation of water sprayed into the air stream. It is less expensive to install and maintain
relative to a vapor compression system, and has lower power consumption, since no compressor
is needed. The working ﬂuid is water, not a halocarbon refrigerant. However, the temperature
decrease of the air stream is smaller when compared to vapor compression cooling.
1.2
BRIEF HISTORY OF COOLING TECHNOLOGIES
1.2.1
REFRIGERATION
Vapor compression systems were ﬁrst commercialized in the early part of the 20th century for
refrigeration applications and then adopted for air conditioning applications. Before the intro-
duction of vapor compression technology, ice was used as the main method of refrigeration. In
winter months, blocks of ice were sawed from frozen river beds and stored in insulated ware-
houses. The ice was then periodically transported to commercial facilities and residences. The
blocks were placed near the ceiling of the enclosure, and the resulting natural convection cold
air currents provided cooling and transferred thermal energy away from the object or space to
be cooled. Blocks of ice were also placed in insulated cabinets to maintain a safe temperature
for storage of food. Similar ice storage techniques were used in passenger trains to provide air
conditioning for the occupants.
In the 1800s, numerous inventors and engineers attempted to develop vapor compression
for refrigeration applications. Jacob Perkins (1766–1849), an American inventor, built the ﬁrst
working vapor compression refrigeration system in 1834. It used ether as the working ﬂuid and
was a closed-cycle that could operate continuously, however, it was not successfully commer-
cialized for industrial use until the late 1800s. In 1851, James Harrison, a Scottish inventor,
developed an ether based vapor compression refrigeration system that was used in the 1880s to
transport frozen meat in ships from Australia to England. Since the transport time to market
was on the order of months, this refrigeration technology vastly increased the ability of meat
producing countries to participate in world trade.
Beginning in 1900, there was a gradual decline in commercial ice houses and a greater
use of on-site vapor compression refrigeration. Industrial vapor compression refrigerators in the
early 1900s used either ammonia (NH3), methyl chloride (CH3Cl), and sulfur dioxide (SO2), as
refrigerants. The toxicity of these working ﬂuids precluded their use for residential refrigeration
and motivated the development of alternative non-toxic refrigerants in the early 1920s. As a
consequence, commercial refrigeration using vapor compression systems preceded domestic re-
frigeration by about 50 years. After the successful development of non-toxic halocarbons, vapor
compression systems began to be widely adopted for domestic refrigeration and air conditioning
applications. With increased electriﬁcation of the United States, the percentage of residences in

4
1. INTRODUCTION TO COOLING TECHNOLOGIES
the U.S. with electrically powered vapor compression refrigerators increased from 44% in 1940
to over 98% by 1960 (Gordon [2016]).
The absorption cooling cycle was invented in 1858 by Ferdinand Carre (1824–1900), a
French scientist. His cycle used water and ammonia to produce ice and preserve food. With the
invention of ammonia absorption cooling, ice was manufactured year round and used for re-
frigeration and air conditioning. In 1900, most ice plants used ammonia absorption technology
to produce ice for both residential and commercial use. In 1925, gas-ﬁred absorption refrigera-
tors for residential use were commercialized and marketed by the Electrolux Corporation, and
widely adopted in rural areas without electricity. Absorption systems are now primarily used in
remote locations which have not been electriﬁed.
1.2.2
AIR CONDITIONING
Before the incorporation of air conditioning systems in buildings, most spaces were cooled us-
ing natural ventilation through windows, incorporation of heavy thermal mass in the building
structure, and evaporative cooling. The ﬁrst mechanical air conditioning system for buildings
was developed by Willis Carrier (1876–1950), an American mechanical engineer in 1903. His
system used a water spray to control the humidity and dew point temperature in a space, and
ﬁlter out dust particles. The paper and textile industries were the earliest adopter of his water
spray air conditioning system, followed by hospitals.
In 1923, the Carrier corporation commercialized a vapor compression cooling system
using dichloroethene as the working ﬂuid. Movie theaters and department stores were early
adopters of this air conditioning system in order to obtain an business advantage over competi-
tors. By 1930, most government, retail, and oﬃce buildings, as well as passenger trains, were air
conditioned using vapor compression systems.
There has been a rapid penetration of air conditioning systems into residential buildings
and vehicles over the last ﬁfty years. For example, the percentage of residences in the U.S. with
central or room air conditioning systems has increased from about 37% in 1970 to 89% in 2010.
Likewise, the percentage of vehicles with air conditioning has increased from about 20% in 1960
to 84% in 1983 (Gordon [2016]). The air conditioning technology employed for vehicles has
been vapor compression. Evaporative coolers for vehicles have been marketed since the 1930s,
but have not been commercially successful.
In the U.S. cooling systems in residential and commercial buildings consume about 15%
of the total heating and cooling load. On the average, the air conditioning percentage is about
8%, and refrigeration is about 7%. The cooling energy use is highly dependent on location and
the speciﬁc cooling application. For example, in supermarkets, refrigeration is 20–50% of the
total energy use, and 1/2 of that is the energy consumed by the compressor.
Air conditioners are rapidly becoming the largest energy consumer in the developing
world. For example, in New Delhi about half of peak electricity is consumed by air conditioners.

1.3. THERMODYNAMIC BACKGROUND

Since only about 5% of residences in India have air conditioners, the energy consumption for
residential cooling in the developing world is expected to greatly increase.
A rapidly growing application of cooling is the thermal management of data centers. A
data center is a building used to house the computing infrastructure for information technology
operations. Data centers include the computing systems software and hardware used for infor-
mation management, storage, and internet communications. Since all of the electrical energy
used by computers is converted to heat, the energy consumption of a data center is very large,
at least one hundred times that of an oﬃce building for the same footprint.
As a result of their large energy consumption, data centers that can use outside air or
evaporative cooling technologies have lower installation and operating costs than mechanically
cooled facilities. Many global service providers are building large scale data centers in cold loca-
tions such as Finland or Sweden to cut power and cooling costs. In these locations, cold outside
air is used directly as a heat sink. In cold locations with access to river or sea water, evaporative
cooling techniques have also been chosen for thermal management of the data center computers.
The adoption of air conditioning in buildings and vehicles has had three major positive ef-
fects. People are more productive when they are cool than when they are overheated and sweaty.
Thus, air conditioning has contributed to the large increase in U.S. manufacturing productivity
observed after 1930. Air conditioning has also allowed a population and a manufacturing mi-
gration to the southeast and southwest regions of the U.S. which have hot, and in places, very
humid climates. The economic growth of the southern states was limited until summer cool-
ing was economically feasible. Lastly, the rates of death and illness during heat waves has also
decreased with the adoption of air conditioning.

THERMODYNAMIC BACKGROUND
1.3.1
THERMODYNAMIC PROPERTIES
In this section, we review the thermodynamics of refrigeration and air conditioning systems.
The thermodynamic analyses apply the ﬁrst and second laws of thermodynamics to determine
the thermal performance of the cooling system cycle and its components. For the purposes of
this text, a thermodynamic cycle is deﬁned as a series of cyclic processes in which a working ﬂuid
changes from one state to another state, eventually returning to its initial state or condition. For
example, in a vapor compression system, the working ﬂuid produces a net cooling eﬀect by being
compressed, condensed, expanded, and evaporated in a cyclic process.
In order to determine the performance of cooling systems, we need to compute the
changes in state of the refrigerant or working ﬂuid ﬂowing through the system. The changes
in state of a working ﬂuid in a cooling system are characterized by changes in its properties such
as pressure p, speciﬁc volume v, internal energy u, temperature T , entropy s, and speciﬁc heats
cp and cv. The property enthalpy h is deﬁned as

ENERGY EQUATION, HEAT, AND WORK
An open thermodynamic system approach is used to calculate the ﬂow of mass and energy
through the components of air conditioning and refrigeration systems, such as fans, pumps,
evaporators, compressors, pipes, and ducts. Analyses of these components will employ mass
conservation, and the ﬁrst and second laws of thermodynamics.

In the mass and energy control volume equations, Pm is the mass ﬂow rate of the working ﬂuid
entering (i) or exiting (e) the control volume, PQ is the heat transfer rate from the surround-
ings to or from the control volume, PW is the rate of work transferred to or from the control
volume, V is the velocity of the working ﬂuid entering or leaving the control volume, g is the
gravitational constant, and z is the elevation of the ﬂuid entering and leaving the control vol-
ume. The sign convention used in this text is that work done by the system inside the control
volume is considered positive, for example turbine expansion; and work done on the system is
considered negative, such as pump compression. Conversely, positive heat transfer is into the
control volume, and negative heat transfer is out of the control volume.

The pressure ratio P2/P1 of compressors used for refrigeration and air conditioning is

In deriving Equation (1.16) it was tacitly assumed that the change in kinetic energy across the
compressor was negligible compared to the change in enthalpy, an assumption usually valid in
practice. If the pressure ratios are suﬃciently large, so that the refrigerant vapor does not follow
the ideal gas equation, then property tables are required.
Actual compression processes are not isentropic, and the working ﬂuid exits with a higher
temperature and entropy than the corresponding isentropic process from state 1 to state 2s.
The adiabatic eﬃciency c of a compressor is deﬁned as the isentropic work required to
compress the gas over the speciﬁed pressure ratio divided by the actual work required to compress
the gas over the same pressure ratio:

PROPERTIES OF AIR-WATER VAPOR MIXTURES
In calculating air conditioning and refrigeration system performance, we also need to compute
the changes in state of a two component working ﬂuid such as an air-water vapor mixture used in
evaporative cooling or a lithium bromide-water mixture used in absorption cooling. Accounting
for the water vapor in an air stream is very important for two reasons. First, the energy required
to add or remove water vapor is non-trivial, and secondly, it has been found that there is a
relatively narrow humidity range that provides acceptable thermal comfort. Energy transfers
to/from an air stream with no change in the moisture content are denoted “sensible” heat transfer,
and energy transfers due to evaporation or condensation of the water vapor from a mixture are
denoted “latent” heat transfer.
There are a number of parameters that are used to quantify the properties of air-water
vapor mixtures. These include the relative humidity, the humidity ratio, the dry and wet bulb
temperature, the dew point temperature, the enthalpy, and the speciﬁc volume.
The relative humidity  is the ratio of the mass of water vapor in an air stream relative to
the maximum mass that it can contain. It is zero for dry air, and equal to one for saturated air. In

1.4. PSYCHROMETRICS

terms of ideal gas pressures, the relative humidity is also expressed as the ratio of Pv, the partial
pressure of the water vapor, to Psat, the water vapor saturation pressure, at the same temperature.
If water vapor is added to a saturated air-water vapor mixture, it will simply condense out:

water vapor, Ma is the molecular mass of air, Ru is the universal gas constant, and P D Pv C Pa

The dewpoint temperature Tdp is the temperature at which water vapor will start to con-
dense out of a gas mixture when cooled at a constant vapor pressure, as shown on the T-s diagram
in Figure 1.2 below. The humidity ratio is constant during this process since the partial pressures
of the air and water are constant, and the relative humidity will increase, since the mixture is
being cooled.

enthalpy is also assumed to vary linearly with temperature, relative to a reference condition,
typically 0ıC. The reference condition for the enthalpy of water vapor is the liquid state at

ADIABATIC SATURATION AND WET BULB TEMPERATURES
Since the relative and absolute humidity of an air stream are diﬃcult to measure directly, they are
determined indirectly through temperature measurements of an unsaturated and a saturated air
stream. Two processes are used, adiabatic saturation and wet bulb temperature measurements.
In the adiabatic saturation process, shown schematically in Figure 1.3, unsaturated am-
bient air at a dry bulb temperature of T1 and humidity ratio !1 is drawn into a long channel
containing a pool of water. As the air ﬂows over the water, there is evaporation of water vapor
from the pool to the air stream until the air stream is saturated. The exiting air temperature T2
is lower than the entering air temperature T1, due to the internal heat transfer from the air to
the pool of water. The adiabatic saturation temperature is the temperature resulting when the air
stream becomes saturated with water vapor adiabatically, with no heat transfer to the surround-
ings. Make-up water is added to the pool of water at the same rate as the evaporation rate, and
at temperature T2. The total pressure P increases during this process, since water vapor is being
added to the air stream, as indicated on the T-s diagram of Figure 1.2.

The air temperature measured by a thermometer with its bulb directly exposed to the air
ﬂow, is deﬁned as the dry bulb temperature Tdb. The wet bulb temperature Twb is measured by
a thermometer with a wetted wick covering the bulb, so as air ﬂows over the wetted wick, the
water in the wick will evaporate. The process is very similar to the adiabatic saturation process.
The energy for evaporation is provided by the air and the thermometer, so the wetted bulb will
cool until it reaches a steady state temperature, deﬁned as the thermodynamic wet bulb, where
the rate of evaporation is equal to the convective heat transfer from the air stream.
Air at a dry bulb temperature of Tdb D25ıC and 100% relative humidity ( D 1) will
have a wet bulb temperature Twb D 25ıC, since the saturated moist air mixture cannot hold
any additional moisture. However, if the relative humidity is lowered below  D 1, evaporation
from the wet bulb thermometer into the air-water vapor mixture can take place, and the wet
bulb temperature will decrease to a value below 25ıC.
For air-water vapor mixtures at atmospheric pressures, the wet-bulb temperature Twb can
be considered to be approximately equal to the adiabatic saturation temperature T2, and used
in the above mass and energy balance equations to calculate the humidity ratio and relative
humidity of an air stream.
Example 1.1 Moist Air Thermodynamic Properties
The dry bulb and wet bulb temperatures
of an air stream at atmospheric pressure are measured in an adiabatic saturation process to be
T1 D Tdb D 25ıC and T2 D Twb D 15ıC, respectively. What is the absolute humidity !1, the
relative humidity 1, and the enthalpy h1 of the air stream?

WEATHER DATA
Weather data for a particular location is needed to estimate the cooling load (kW) of a building
and the annual energy consumption (kJ) of the cooling system. For a given location, the cooling
load calculation uses the dry and wet bulb temperatures, and the energy consumption calculation
uses cooling degree-day data.

14
1. INTRODUCTION TO COOLING TECHNOLOGIES
Weather data, including dry and wet bulb temperature and cooling degree day data in
the U.S. and the world, are available in the ASHRAE Handbook of Fundamentals, Chapter 14,
“Climatic Design Information” (ASHRAE [2017a]). For cooling energy calculation, cooling
degree days have been tabulated for balance temperatures of 18.3ıC (65ıF). For determination
of cooling loads, the temperature information is given in terms of temperature values that are
exceeded by a given percentage of the hours in a year. The percentage typically used for the
selection of cooling equipment, is 0.4%, i.e., 35 hr in a year of 8,760 hr. Thus, equipment sized
using the 0.4% criteria are predicted to have the capacity to meet the cooling load for 99.6% of
the time.
The data tables in the ASHRAE Handbook provide the 0.4% dry bulb (db) temperature
and the mean coincident wet bulb (wb) temperature, which is the average value of the wet bulb
temperature at that dry bulb temperature. For example, in Phoenix, the 0.4% design dry bulb is
43.5ıC and mean coincident wet bulb temperature is 20.8ıC, which means that only 35 hr in a
year exceed 43.5ıC temperature.
The potential for evaporative cooling of a space depends on the diﬀerence between the
wet and dry bulb temperatures, as illustrated by Table 1.1 below.

Hot and dry climates such as Phoenix, Denver, and Cairo have much larger diﬀerences
between their dry and wet bulb temperatures when compared to more humid climates such as
Houston and Washington, DC, and so are excellent locations for evaporative cooling systems.
The cooling degree days DDc are deﬁned in Equation (1.39) as the integral over a time
period t of the positive diﬀerence between a balance temperature Tbal, and the ambient temper-
ature Ta, and has units ıC-day. The plus sign superscript indicates that only positive diﬀerences

The balance temperature Tbal is the value of the outdoor temperature where the heat transfer
from the space is equal to the internal gains from solar radiation, equipment, and people. It is less
than the indoor temperature to provide heat transfer from the space. If the outdoor temperature
is greater than the balance temperature, then cooling of the space is required to maintain the
indoor temperature.

1. INTRODUCTION TO COOLING TECHNOLOGIES
Note that the saturation line  D 1 deﬁnes the upper extent of the chart.
The psychrometric chart was developed by W. Carrier in 1904. It is very useful for deter-
mining the heating and cooling energy requirements for air conditioning applications. All of the
moist air thermodynamic properties are drawn on the psychrometric chart using the equations
derived in the previous section, so given one set of conditions, such as inlet air from the envi-
ronment, one can visualize and quickly calculate the changes in the thermodynamic state of the
air stream that are required to meet a set of conditions for an occupied space, such as thermal
comfort and ventilation.
As shown in Figure 1.5, the lines of constant enthalpy slope downward, since as the dry
bulb temperature increases, the humidity ratio decreases to maintain a constant enthalpy. The
diagonal lines of constant wet bulb temperature also slope downward, coinciding with the dry
bulb temperature at the saturation line. The lines of constant enthalpy and wet bulb temperature
are almost parallel to each other, since the measurement of wet bulb temperature approximates
a constant enthalpy process.

The dew point temperature is the dry bulb temperature at the point where the mixture
is saturated and the relative humidity equals one. The lines of constant speciﬁc volume are very
steep since v is not a strong function of the humidity ratio.
Sensible heat transfer is represented by a horizontal line on the chart, as it occurs at a con-
stant humidity ratio with no change in the moisture content. Latent heat transfer is represented
by a vertical line on the chart, as it occurs at a constant dry bulb temperature, with a change in

0:0140 and the wet bulb temperature is 25.1ıC. The cooling process from 1-2 is sensible cooling
and is represented by a horizontal line at constant humidity ratio. At state 2, the relative humidity
has increased to 2 D 0:53. As the moist air is cooled further, condensation will occur at state 3
on the saturation line 3 D 1 with a corresponding dew point temperature of 19ıC. The cooling
process from state 3 to state 4 includes both sensible and latent cooling with a decrease in the
humidity ratio of the saturated air to !4 D 0:0106.

THERMAL COMFORT
The primary function of an HVAC cooling system is to provide acceptable environmental condi-
tions for the occupants. Accordingly, the air temperature of the indoor space needs to be chosen
by the building engineer or user so that most of the occupants feel comfortable most of the time
independent of the outdoor environmental conditions.
Based on extensive thermal comfort research, ASHRAE [2017b] has developed a set of
recommendations for thermal comfort that include parameters such as the dry bulb temperature,
mean radiant temperature, relative humidity, and indoor air speed. The ranges and combinations
of these parameters that provide comfortable thermal conditions for people have been measured
in controlled conditions for many diﬀerent clothing levels and ranges of metabolic activity.
A thermal sensation scale ranging from cold to hot is used in thermal comfort research to
quantify a person’s thermal sensation. The scale has integer values: C3 for feeling hot, C2 warm,
C1 slightly warm, 0 neutral,  1 slightly cold,  2 cool, and  3 feeling cold. The average of the
responses from the subjects in the experiments is termed the Predicted Mean Vote (PMV), and
the Predicted Percentage Dissatisﬁed (PPD) is deﬁned as the percentage of people in a group
that would ﬁnd the thermal environment unacceptable. The ASHRAE recommendations are
based on a 90% acceptance rate, based on a PMV between slightly cool and slightly warm.
For a neutral thermal sensation, from the First Law of thermodynamics, the rate of energy
generation by a person’s metabolism must equal the rate of energy transferred to the environ-
ment and the rate of work. The thermal energy is transferred by sensible and latent heat transfer
from the exposed skin and the clothing layers, respiration, and work. The sensible heat transfer
is a combination of convection and radiation from the skin and the surface of the clothing. For
a warm or hot sensation, the metabolic energy and transferred energy do not balance, and as
a result, energy is stored in the body and there is an increase in the skin and body tempera-
ture. Conversely, a cool or cold thermal sensation results from a decrease in the skin and body
temperature.

The physical activity level of a person is quantiﬁed by the metabolic rate parameter M
with units of mets. A value of 1.0 met is deﬁned as the metabolic rate of a sedentary person and
is equal to 58.2 W/m2. For a surface area of 1.8 m2, this is equal to 105 W. At rest, about 90%
of the energy transfer is from the skin and clothing, and 10% respiration. As the activity level
increases, the respiration fraction increases signiﬁcantly. The metabolic rates for various activity
levels are given in Table 1.2.

The clothing insulation level of a person is quantiﬁed by the parameter I with units of clo,
a measure of thermal resistance. A value of 1.0 clo is equivalent to 0.155 (m2-K)/W. Various
clothing insulation values for a person that is not moving are given in Table 1.3. For example,
a typical summer clothing level of trousers and a short sleeve shirt has a clo value of 0.57. The
clothing insulation values for an active person who is moving decreases due to the air motion
between and through the clothing layers. An estimate of the clothing insulation for an active
person with 1.2 < M < 2.0 is

a given clothing level I, an activity level above 1.2 mets, for an air speed less than 0.15 m/s and
50% relative humidity. As the clothing and activity levels increase, the set point of the thermostat
will need to be lowered to maintain acceptable thermal comfort. In general, the air temperature
needs to be decreased by 0.6ıC for every 0.1 clo increase in clothing, and also decreased by 3ıC

The ASHRAE thermal comfort zones are deﬁned in terms of an operative temperature
To which is a measure of the combined eﬀect of convection and radiation. For situations where
the heat transfer coeﬃcients for radiation and convection are approximately equal, and the local
air speed is less than 0.2 m/s, the operative temperature is given by
To D Ta C Tr

;
(1.46)
where Ta is the average temperature of the air in the space, and Tr is the mean radiant tem-
perature, i.e., the average temperature of the surrounding surfaces, including windows, walls,
ceiling, and ﬂoor. In the interior zones of commercial buildings, the operative temperature is
essentially equal to the air temperature. In perimeter zones, the eﬀect of windows will increase
the inﬂuence of thermal radiation on the operative temperature.
The indoor local air speed V is also an important consideration to avoid local discomfort
due to draft. For seated oﬃce activities, with operative temperatures above 25.5ıC, the air speed
should not exceed 0.8 m/s, and for operative temperatures below 22.5ıC, the air speed should not
exceed 0.15 m/s. For operative temperatures between these limits, a curve ﬁt for the maximum
air speed is

Solution
Assume that the oﬃce staﬀwear pants and long-sleeved shirts with an stationary insulation
value of 0.6 clo, and is a mixture of seated and standing people with an average activity of 1.2

shorts with an insulation value of 0.22 clo (moving), and an average activity level of 3.0 mets.

The air conditioning control system will need to be reprogrammed to lower the thermostat set
point in the space from 23.7ıC to 19.3ıC.
The ASHRAE thermal comfort zones are presented in Figure 1.8, which is an overlay of
the comfort zones on the psychrometric chart with the operative temperature on the horizontal
axis and the humidity ratio on the vertical axis. Two zones are shown, one for 0.5 clo of cloth-
ing insulation, and one for 1.0 clo of insulation. As discussed above, these insulation levels are
the lower and upper ranges of clothing insulation typically worn in oﬃce environments. The
comfort zone will move to regions of lower temperature with an increase in clothing insulation,
metabolic rate, and mean radiant temperature. Conversely, the comfort zone will move to re-
gions of higher temperature with a decrease in clothing insulation, metabolic rate, and mean
radiant temperature.
The upper humidity limit is 0.012 kgv/kga, as above that level, one’s skin feels damp and
uncomfortable. There are no established lower humidity limits for thermal comfort, however,
non thermal comfort factors such as skin and eye dryness should be considered. In Figure 1.8,
the local air speed in the zone is assumed to be not greater than 0.2 m/s. Elevated air speed can
be used to increase the maximum operative temperature using Equation (1.47).
The approximate middle of the range, 25ıC and 50% relative humidity, is widely used as
a cooling design condition for the 0.5 clo comfort zone.

Vapor Compression Cooling
Cycles
2.1
INTRODUCTION
In this chapter we examine vapor compression cycles for refrigeration and air conditioning. We
ﬁrst review the Carnot cycle, then perform a thermodynamic analysis of basic vapor compres-
sion cycles to illustrate the various thermal eﬃciency measures and the eﬀect of condenser and
evaporator temperatures, discuss the thermodynamic properties of common refrigerants, com-
pute part load performance, and ﬁnish with an analysis of multistage vapor compression cooling
cycles.
Since the second law of thermodynamics states that thermal energy can ﬂow only from
high temperatures to low temperatures, a thermodynamic cycle is required to produce a cooling
or refrigeration eﬀect that results in a net ﬂow of thermal energy originating from a low tem-
perature object or space to be cooled and then transferred to a higher temperature heat sink. A
vapor compression cycle takes advantage of the phase change of a working ﬂuid in an evapo-
rator and a condenser to eﬀect this net heat transfer from a low temperature source to a high
temperature sink.
2.2
CARNOT REFRIGERATION CYCLE
The scientiﬁc theory of thermodynamic cycles was ﬁrst developed by Sadi Carnot (1796–1832),
a French engineer, in 1824. His theory has two main axioms. The ﬁrst axiom is that in order to
to use a ﬂow of energy to generate power, there needs to be two bodies at diﬀerent temperatures,
a hot body and a cold body. Work is extracted from the ﬂow of energy from the hot to the cold
body or reservoir. The second axiom is that there must be at no point a useless ﬂow of energy, so
heat transfer at a constant temperature is needed. Carnot developed an ideal heat engine cycle,
which is reversible, i.e., if the balance of pressures is altered, the cycle of operation is reversed.
The eﬃciency of this cycle, known as the Carnot cycle, is a function only of the reservoir
temperatures. The Carnot cycle, since it is reversible, is the most eﬃcient possible, and thus is
the standard to which all real cycles are compared. An ideal refrigeration cycle is a Carnot cycle
operated in reverse. It consumes work, and has the net eﬀect of removing heat from the low
temperature reservoir at temperature Tl, and rejecting it to the high temperature reservoir at
temperature Th.

One eﬃciency metric for cooling cycles is the Coeﬃcient of Performance (COP), which
is the thermal energy transferred from the object to be cooled, Ql, divided by the compressor
work W required. The COP is the dimensionless ratio of how much heat is transferred out of
the cooled space relative to the amount of work that is used to accomplish this task. Note that
the COP is larger than unity.

VAPOR COMPRESSION CYCLE OPERATION
The basic components of the vapor compression cycle are shown in Figure 2.2. A compressor or
pump is used to compress the vapor from low to high pressure, heat energy Qh is transferred to
the environment in the condenser, an expansion valve is used to reduce the pressure, and thermal
energy Ql is transferred from the space or object to be cooled to the evaporator.

The ideal vapor compression cycle operates in a similar fashion to the ideal Carnot re-
frigeration cycle, but with constant pressure condensation and evaporation of the refrigerant or
working ﬂuid. Representative state points on the temperature-entropy (T-s) diagram are plotted
in Figure 2.3. The four basic processes in the cycle in Figure 2.3 are
1 to 2
vapor compression
2 to 3
constant pressure condensation
3 to 4
adiabatic expansion
4 to 1
constant pressure evaporation
Most of the heat transfer at the lower and higher temperatures is accomplished isother-
mally, similar to the Carnot cycle. As we will see, the overall performance of a vapor compression
system is very dependent on the saturation temperatures of the refrigerant in the evaporator and
in the condenser.
The vapor compression cycle can also be plotted on a pressure-enthalpy (P-h) plot, as
shown in Figure 2.4, so that changes in enthalpy from one state to another can be read directly
from the diagram.

VAPOR COMPRESSION CYCLE ANALYSIS
We use energy balances on each of the components shown in Figure 2.2 to determine the overall
system performance. For each component, the open system energy equation per unit mass of

refrigerant is

(2.2)
Note that state 1 is assumed to be saturated vapor, and state 3 is saturated liquid. In prac-
tice, evaporators usually are designed to superheat the refrigerant by a small amount to ensure
that no liquid enters the compressor, thereby avoiding possible compressor damage. Similarly,
condensers are usually designed to subcool the refrigerant a certain amount to ensure that only
liquid enters the throttling device for optimum expansion performance.
Starting at point 1, a saturated vapor at low pressure Pl is compressed to a higher pressure
Ph and a superheated temperature at state 2. The energy equations for isentropic (s) and actual
compression (c) processes are:
ws D h2s   h1
wc D h2   h1:
(2.3)
For an ideal case with adiabatic and reversible compression, the entropy of the exit state
2s, s2s, is equal to the entropy of the inlet state 1, s1. In actual operation, there are irreversibilities
and there is an increase in entropy, and the working ﬂuid is compressed to a higher temperature
T2, as shown in Figure 2.5.

(2.5)
From state 2 to state 3, heat is transferred from the working ﬂuid to the environment at temper-
ature Th through constant pressure heat rejection. The heat transfer process is primarily conden-
sation from a superheated vapor to a saturated liquid. In operation, there is a pressure drop in
the working ﬂuid as it ﬂows through the condenser. The heat transfer in the condenser is given
by
qh D h3   h2:
(2.6)
A throttling device is used to reduce the working ﬂuid pressure in an adiabatic expansion
from the high pressure state 3 to the low pressure state 4. Since there is no work done by the
throttle, and the throttling is assumed to be adiabatic, the resulting energy balance equation is
h4 D h3:
(2.7)
Finally, heat is transferred from the body to be cooled at temperature Tb to the working
ﬂuid at temperature Tl in a constant pressure heat addition in the evaporator. This is the refrig-
eration or cooling eﬀect. The heat transfer in this case is through evaporation in the two phase
region under the vapor dome from state 4 to state 1, and the resulting energy balance equation
is

EFFICIENCY MEASURES—COP, EER, AND SEER
We use three related parameters, COP, EER, and SEER, to quantify the thermal eﬃciency of
thermodynamic cooling cycles. As in the Carnot refrigeration cycle, the Coeﬃcient of Perfor-
mance (COP) for the vapor compression cycle is the refrigeration heat transfer ql divided by
the compressor work wc required:
COP D ql
wc
:
(2.9)
The cooling capacity is deﬁned as the rate of cooling PQl (kW),
PQl D Pmql;
(2.10)
where Pm is the working ﬂuid mass ﬂowrate, typically in unit of kg/s. In the English system, the
cooling capacity is deﬁned in terms of tons, where 1 ton D 12,000 Btu/hr D 3.52 kW. The ton
unit is based on ice storage, and is the amount of energy required to melt 2,000 lb of ice at 32ıF
in 24 hr.

2.5. EFFICIENCY MEASURES—COP, EER, AND SEER

The COP is also expressed as a ratio of the cooling capacity to the compressor power:
COP D

(2.11)
The reciprocal of the COP is the kW/ton, where the cooling capacity is in tons, and the
compressor power is in kW. Typical values for the COP range from 4.0–7.0, corresponding
to kW/ton values from 0.50–0.88, depending on the type and size of the compressor, and the
compressor and evaporator temperatures. Representative values for three types of compressors
are given in Table 2.1. The chiller ratings are reported for 100% load and at 44ıF (6.7ıC) leaving
chilled water temperature and 85ıF (29.4ıC) entering condenser water temperature.

The eﬃciency of air conditioners is often compared using the parameters EER, the Energy
Eﬃciency Ratio, and SEER, the Seasonal Energy Eﬃciency Ratio. The EER is deﬁned as the
evaporator cooling capacity in BTU divided by the compressor energy input in Watt-hour, i.e.,
a COP with mixed units. Applying the unit conversion to the COP, we have
EER D 3:412 COP:
(2.12)
The EER is calculated assuming a constant outside temperature Th of 35ıC, and a con-
stant inside temperature of 27ıC. It is used primarily for small window mounted air condition-
ers. Air conditioners with EER > 11:6 are given an Energy Star Rating by the U.S. EPA. Air
conditioners are currently available that have EER’s as high as 16.
By way of comparison, the maximum EER is found by assuming an ideal Carnot cycle
operating between an outside temperature of Th D 35ıC (308 K) and an inside temperature of
Tl D 27ıC (300 K).

This is about ten times the current EER, indicating that there is plenty of room for eﬃciency
improvements, even accounting for the temperature diﬀerences across the evaporator and con-
denser.

The COP is averaged over a cooling season to form the SEER, the Seasonal Energy Ef-
ﬁciency Ratio. Like the EER, the SEER also has mixed units of Btu/W-hr.

The SEER is calculated using an average value of the outdoor temperature of Th D 28:3ıC,
a range of temperature intervals from 18–40ıC, and a speciﬁed amount of time in each temper-
ature interval. Since the SEER outside temperature is less than the EER outside temperature, in
accordance with the Second Law, the SEER will be greater than the EER for the same equip-
ment. As a rule of thumb,
SEER D 3:9 COP:
(2.15)
An air conditioner with a COP of 4.0, will have an EER of 13.6, and a SEER approximately
equal to 15.6.
To increase energy eﬃciency and reduce the greenhouse gas emissions from electric power
plants, many governments have adopted minimum performance standards for air conditioners.
For example, as of 2015, in accordance with U.S. EPA regulations, all split system central air
conditioners in the South East and South West United States must have a minimum SEER
value of 14. Typical values for DOE Energy Star central air conditioners range from 18–26.
Measures such as incorporation of variable speed compressors and fans are used to increase a/c
system eﬃciency.
2.6
REFRIGERANTS
There are many choices for the working ﬂuid in vapor compression cycles. The major requirement
is that the thermal properties of the refrigerant ﬂuid match the requirements of the given appli-
cation. The thermal-ﬂuid requirements are a moderate condensation pressure so high-pressure
rated components are not needed, an evaporation pressure above atmospheric pressure to pre-
vent air leakage into the system, a boiling temperature of about 5–10ıC at atmospheric pressure,
a high critical temperature so phase change heat transfer can be employed, a high latent heat
of vaporization to reduce the required working ﬂuid ﬂow rate, high thermal conductivity, low
kinematic viscosity, and a low freezing temperature.
Other important considerations are low global warming potential, toxicity, stability,
ﬂammability, cost, lubricant and materials compatibility, and environmental impact. The re-
frigerant properties are also a consideration in compressor selection, as reciprocating compres-
sors are suitable for working ﬂuids with a low speciﬁc volume, and centrifugal compressors are
best adapted to working ﬂuids with high speciﬁc volumes. Refrigerants also diﬀer with respect
to their miscibility with oil, and also the amount of water that they can hold in solution. As
this section discusses in detail, there is no “perfect” refrigerant, and the choice for a particular
application will necessarily involve compromises.

2.6. REFRIGERANTS
33
Refrigerants with similar vapor pressures will evaporate and condense at the same pres-
sures. Therefore a vapor compression cycle designed to operate at given condenser and evaporator
pressures will perform comparably for two refrigerants with similar vapor pressures. However,
diﬀerences in speciﬁc volumes will require diﬀerent working ﬂuid ﬂow rates for each refrigerant.
A mixture of refrigerants is deﬁned as a zeotropic mixture, and will have a diﬀerent satura-
tion temperature for each component at the same pressure. The temperature diﬀerence between
the saturated vapor temperature and the saturated liquid temperature at a constant pressure is
deﬁned as the temperature glide. The temperature glide of a single component refrigerant is
zero. For a zeotropic mixture at a given temperature or pressure, the compositions of the liquid
and vapor phases are diﬀerent, with the vapor composition having a higher concentration of
the low boiling point components in the mixture. As a result of this composition diﬀerence,
zeotropic mixtures have a temperature glide when they boil or condense.
There are four widely used refrigerants in use at the present time in cooling systems.
These refrigerants are in the halocarbon class, namely the hydrochloroﬂuorocarbons R-22 and
R-123, and the hydroﬂuorocarbons R-134a and R-410a. A halocarbon is a carbon-hydrogen
based molecule bonded to the halogens chlorine and/or ﬂuorine. There are three major types
of halocarbons, chloroﬂuorocarbon (CFC), hydrochloroﬂuorocarbons (HCFC), and hydroﬂu-
orocarbons (HFC). CFC’s are fully halogenated and contain chlorine and ﬂuorine atoms, and
no hydrogen atoms. HCFC’s have hydrogen atoms and fewer chlorine atoms than CFC’s, and
HFC’s contain no chlorine atoms, and are composed only of hydrogen, ﬂuorine, and carbon.
CFC’s and HCFC’s are very stable, nontoxic, and have a relatively low cost.
Halocarbons were ﬁrst synthesized in 1928 by T. Midgley (1889–1944), a mechanical
engineer at the General Motors Research Laboratory, initially for automotive air condition-
ing applications. They are synthesized by substituting one or more of the hydrogen atoms in a
methane or ethane molecule with atoms from the halogen family of chlorine, ﬂuorine, and/or
bromine.
The halocarbon numbering system developed by Midgley is as follows. The leading “R”
signiﬁes a refrigerant for vapor compression systems. For carbon based refrigerants, the ﬁrst
number indicates the number of carbon atoms minus one, the second number is the number of
hydrogen atoms plus one, and the third number is the number of ﬂuorine atoms. For example,
R-134a has two carbon atoms, two hydrogen atoms, and four ﬂuorine atoms. The “a” speci-
ﬁes a speciﬁc conﬁguration of the molecule. As indicated in Table 2.2, inorganic compounds
are numbered by adding 700 to their molecular mass. For example, ammonia (M D 17.03) is
numbered R-717, carbon dioxide (M D 44.01) is numbered R-744, and water (M D 18.015) is
numbered R-718.
From the 1930s–1990s, most refrigerants used in vapor compression cooling systems were
of the CFC type, primarily CFC-12, which is also known as Freon F-12 or Refrigerant R-
12. Because of its non-toxicity, Freon became the preferred coolant in large air-conditioning

34
2. VAPOR COMPRESSION COOLING CYCLES
systems. In fact, public health codes in many American cities were revised to designate Freon as
the only coolant that could be used in public buildings.
However, as a result of it’s stability and long lifetime in the environment, Freon is able
to migrate upward to the stratospheric ozone layer, which absorbs harmful ultraviolet solar ra-
diation, and reduces the UV levels at the ground level. CFC’s can remain in the atmosphere
for about 100 years. In the stratosphere, the chlorine atoms in the CFC’s and HCFC’s react
with the stratospheric ozone, reducing the ozone concentration, resulting in an increase of the
ultraviolet (UV) level on the earth’s surface.
As a result of the discovery of the eﬀect of CFC’s on the ozone layer, the 1989 Montreal
Protocol, signed by a majority of the world’s industrialized nations, mandated the phase-out of
CFC’s (R-11, -12, -113, -114, -115) by 1996, and HCFC’s (R-21, -22, -123) from 2004–2030.
Since they have no chlorine, HFCs have an ozone depletion potential of zero. The replacement
for CFC R-12 has been the HFC R-134a, as it has very similar properties. This refrigerant was
ﬁrst synthesized in 1936, by A. Henne (1901–1967) an American colleague of T. Midgley. The
replacement for HCFC R-22 has been the mixture HFC R-410a, which is a mixture of 50% R-
32 and 50% R-125, and is the primary refrigerant presently used in residential and commercial
air conditioning systems.
HFC’s are greenhouse gases, and thus their manufacture and use has became increasingly
regulated. A greenhouse gas is one which absorbs infrared radiation from the earth’s surface,
reducing the radiation loss from earth to space, thus increasing the temperature of the atmo-
sphere, earth, and oceans. The metric used for the climatic impact of greenhouse gases is the
global warming potential (GWP), normalized to a value of 1 for carbon dioxide. With increas-
ing climate change due to the buildup of greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere, there has
been a world-wide impetus to transition to refrigerants that have a low GWP.
R-134a has a GWP of 1430, and R-410a has a GWP of 500. By way of comparison, the
global warming potential of R-11 is 10,900, and R-22 is 1600. The Kigali Amendment to the
Montreal Protocol approved in 2016 commits nations to a staged phaseout of HFC’s with three
levels. The United States and Europe will reduce HFC use to 15% of 2012 levels by 2036, much
of the rest of the world will reduce HFC use to 20% of 2021 levels by 2045, with the exception of
some Middle Eastern and Asian nations in hot climates, such as Saudia Arabia, Kuwait, India,
and Pakistan, which will reduce HFC use to 15% of 2025 levels by 2047.
A new class of refrigerants called hydroﬂuorooleﬁns (HFO) which are unsaturated hy-
droﬂuorocarbons have been developed. Some HFO refrigerants that have a relatively low global
warming potential are R-1234yf, and R-1234ze. The global warming potential of R-1234yf is 4.
These HFOs are being blended with existing HFC’s to reduce their global warming potential.
For example, the refrigerant R513a, known as Opteon®, has been formulated as a replacement
for R-134a. It is a blend of 56% R1234yf and 44% R-134a, and has a GWP of about 630.
However, many of these newer HFO refrigerants are mildly ﬂammable.

2.6. REFRIGERANTS
35
The thermodynamic properties of some widely used refrigerants are given in Table 2.2.
There has also been renewed interest in naturally occurring refrigerants that have a low or zero
global warming potential. Examples are refrigerants such as propane, butane, carbon dioxide,
and ammonia, also listed in Table 2.2. Note that propane and butane are ﬂammable.
Carbon dioxide is inexpensive, a byproduct from industrial production, non-toxic and
non-ﬂammable. Since its critical temperature is 31ıC, carbon dioxide has a loss of capacity at
high temperatures. Due to its high condenser pressure which is about 7,000 kPa at 30ıC, a high
pressure system is required.
Ammonia is relatively inexpensive, has a high latent heat, is environmentally stable, non-
corrosive, and mildly ﬂammable. It has the largest refrigeration eﬀect per kg (' 1,100 kJ/kg)
of refrigerant ﬂuids. It is used in large scale industrial food refrigeration, such as cold storage,
frozen food, dairy, and meat processing. However, ammonia is highly toxic, so it is not suitable
for domestic refrigeration and air conditioning. Ammonia systems require the use of stainless
steel piping, since it ammonia becomes corrosive to non-ferrous metals such as copper and brass
when it absorbs moisture.
Note that the evaporation pressures at  15ıC of the refrigerants listed are greater than
atmospheric pressure except for water. The condenser pressures at 30ıC are approximately 700–
1,100 kPa, except for carbon dioxide, which has a much greater pressure.

possible replacement is is the refrigerant propane (R-290). For a condensing temperature of

The properties of refrigerants R-22 and Propane (R-290) are obtained from ASHRAE
property tables.

Discussion: The R-290 condenser pressure is 10 % lower, and evaporator pressure is 5
% lower, both comparable to R-22, so no high pressure retroﬁt would be required. R-290 has
almost double the speciﬁc compressor work wc, and refrigeration ql, due to its greater latent
heat. The work and refrigeration eﬀects balance, so the COP values are very close, with only a
6 % decrease for the R-290 replacement. Note that there is a ﬂammability issue with propane.

EFFECT OF EVAPORATOR AND CONDENSER
TEMPERATURE
In general, the cooling capacity PQl increases with increasing evaporator temperature and with
decreasing condenser temperature. Accordingly, the capacity is greatest when the diﬀerence
in temperature between the evaporator and the condenser is minimized. Also, the compressor
power PWc increases with increasing evaporator temperatures and increasing condenser temper-
atures.
The evaporator and condenser temperature eﬀect on capacity and compressor power can
be explained by applying the energy equation to the evaporator and the compressor. From the
open system energy equation, the capacity depends on the product of the refrigerant density 1
and the evaporator enthalpy diﬀerence .h1   h4/:
PQl D Pmql D 1 PV1.h1   h4/:
(2.16)
For an increase in the evaporator temperature, as shown in Figure 2.7, the evaporator pressure is
increased, which will increase the vapor density at state 1. It will also decrease the quality of the

refrigerant entering the evaporator at state 4, which increases the evaporator enthalpy diﬀerence
.h1   h4/. These two factors combine to increase the cooling capacity of the chiller.
As the condenser temperature is increased as shown in Figure 2.8, the ﬂow rate will de-
crease because of the higher discharge pressure P2. The quality of the refrigerant entering the
evaporator at state 4 will also increase, which will decrease the evaporator enthalpy diﬀerence
.h1   h4/. Both of these factors will decrease the cooling capacity.
The compressor power is a function of the product of the refrigerant density 1 and the
compressor enthalpy change .h2   h1/:
PWc D Pmwc D 1 PV1.h2   h1/:
(2.17)
For the compressor, as the evaporator temperature is increased at state 1, the mass ﬂow rate is
increased with the increase in inlet density, and the enthalpy change h2   h1 decreases. The net
eﬀect is to increase the required compressor power due to the increase in mass ﬂow. With an
increase in condenser temperature, there is an increase in the enthalpy change .h2   h1/, and a
corresponding increase in the compressor power.
Cooling capacity and compressor power are presented in a representative compressor map
in Figure 2.9. The speciﬁc compressor represented in Figure 2.9 is a 10-ton reciprocating four-
cylinder semi-hermetic compressor operating at 1725 rpm with an air-to-liquid evaporator and
condenser. The compressor performance is given as a function of the condensing and evaporat-
ing temperatures. The compressor map graphically indicates that to maximize capacity, a vapor
compression system should be designed to operate at the highest practical evaporator temper-

ature, and the lowest condensing temperature. Also, the cycle performance is more sensitive to
changes in the evaporator temperature than changes in the condenser temperature.
For reasonable heat transfer rates, the temperature of the ﬂuid (air or water) used to cool
the condenser should be about 10ıC less than the condensing refrigerant, and the temperature of
the heat transfer ﬂuid used in the evaporator should be about 10ıC greater than the evaporating
refrigerant.
Example 2.2 Eﬀect of Evaporator and Condenser Temperatures
An ideal vapor compres-
sion system operates with R-134a as the working ﬂuid. The temperature of the refrigerant in
the evaporator is  20ıC and in the condenser is 40ıC.

(b) If the evaporator temperature is changed to C5ıC, what is the eﬀect on ql and COP?
(c) If the condenser temperature is changed to C50ıC, what is the eﬀect on ql and COP?
Solution
The T-s diagrams for the increased evaporator temperature and the increased condenser tem-
perature are given in Figures 2.7 and 2.8. The properties of refrigerant R-134a are obtained from
property tables.

The cycle parameters for the three cases are tabulated in Table 2.3. As the evaporator temperature
increases from  20 to C5ıC, the refrigeration ql and the COP increase, while the compression
work wc decreases. The increase in the refrigeration eﬀect at higher evaporator temperatures
is the result of the decrease in the quality of the working ﬂuid entering the evaporator. This
increases the amount of ﬂuid that can be vaporized. The speciﬁc compressor work decreases
since the pressure diﬀerence decreases.
Conversely, as the condenser temperature increases from C40 to C50ıC, the refrigeration
ql and the COP decrease, and the compression work wc increases. The decrease in ql and the
COP is due to the increase in the quality of the of the working ﬂuid entering the evaporator.
The speciﬁc compressor work increases since the pressure diﬀerence increases.

PART LOAD PERFORMANCE
The performance at part capacity, i.e., part load, is an important performance metric for cool-
ing equipment. Chillers are sized to meet a maximum design cooling load, but operate at this
maximum load a small fraction of the time. Most of the time the cooling system will operate at
part load to meet loads that are less than the design load.
With centrifugal compressors, the load or capacity is controlled by varying the rotational
speed of the compressor using variable frequency drives or adjusting the inlet guide vanes to

42
2. VAPOR COMPRESSION COOLING CYCLES
change the inlet swirl of the working ﬂuid. With multi-cylinder reciprocating compressors, the
capacity is controlled by closing inlet valves and unloading cylinders so there is no refrigerant
ﬂow through a given cylinder. Small capacity systems will cycle the compressor oﬀand on.
However, due to refrigerant migration from the high pressure condenser to the low pressure
evaporator when the unit is oﬀ, on-oﬀcycling will reduce the part load eﬃciency.
We deﬁne the Part Load Ratio (PLR) as the ratio of the part load PQl to the full load
capacity PQfull,

MULTISTAGE VAPOR COMPRESSION SYSTEMS
When the design temperature diﬀerence between the evaporator and the condenser is larger
than about 50ıC, multistage vapor compression with intercooling is used to keep the pressure
ratio from exceeding values greater than ﬁve to one. The vapor is compressed in stages, and
cooled between each stage, reducing the overall compression work required and the compressor
discharge temperature. Both reciprocating and centrifugal compressors are used in multistage
systems.
The compression process in the superheated vapor region for an ideal two stage system is
shown on the T-s diagram in Figure 2.10. The working ﬂuid is compressed in the ﬁrst stage from
the evaporator pressure P1 to an intermediate pressure Pi, cooled to the initial temperature T1
at constant pressure in the intercooler, and then is compressed in the second stage from pressure
Pi to the condenser pressure P2. Note the decrease in the compressor discharge temperature T2
with intercooling.

EVAPORATIVE COOLING
3.1.1
INTRODUCTION
Evaporative cooling can be used in dry or low humidity climates for cooling purposes. These
climates include the southwestern U.S., Mexico, Australia, and the Middle East. This technique
takes advantage of the latent heat of vaporization of water. As a hot stream of air evaporates a
water droplet or ﬁlm, the water absorbs thermal energy from the air, and the air is cooled.
The potential for evaporative cooling depends on the diﬀerence between the dry and wet bulb
temperatures of the ambient air, i.e., on the initial air temperature and humidity.
Evaporative cooling is much less expensive that vapor compression cooling, since no me-
chanical components are needed. It is less expensive to install and maintain, and has lower power
consumption. The working ﬂuid is water, not a halocarbon refrigerant. However, the tempera-
ture decrease of the air stream is smaller when compared to vapor compression cooling. There
is no dehumidiﬁcation in direct evaporative cooling, so evaporative cooling can result in high
humidity levels in indoor spaces.
3.1.2
DIRECT EVAPORATIVE COOLING
There are two methods of evaporative cooling: direct and indirect. In direct evaporative cooling,
as shown in Figure 3.1, water comes into contact with the inlet air either as a spray or on a
wetted porous matrix. With a wetted matrix, inlet air from the environment is drawn over the
wetted pad and discharged into the space to be cooled. Wood ﬁber or plastic pads are used to
maximize the surface contact area. A water pump with a make-up sump water supply is used to
keep the porous matrix saturated. The pump supplies water to the top of the pad. As the water
drains through the pad, a portion of the water evaporates, and the remainder ﬂows back to the
sump. Make up water is added to the sump at the same rate as the evaporation from the wetted
pad.
The direct evaporative cooling process is modeled as an adiabatic saturation process. From
the open system energy equation, if there is no work or heat transfer to the surroundings, then the
enthalpy h and the wet bulb temperature Twb of the air stream are essentially unchanged during
the evaporation process. Accordingly, on the psychrometric chart, the process then follows a

3.1.3
INDIRECT EVAPORATIVE COOLING
Indirect evaporative coolers are heat exchangers with a dry primary channel and a wet sec-
ondary channel separated by an impermeable wall. The basic conﬁguration of a parallel ﬂow
indirect evaporative cooler is sketched in Figure 3.3. The primary air stream is cooled sensibly
by convective heat transfer to the impermeable wall without addition of moisture and is the cold
air supply for a space. An advantage of indirect evaporative cooling is that there is no added
humidity to the primary air stream.

Figure 3.3: Indirect evaporative cooling.
The air in the wet secondary channel is cooled by evaporation. The cold wall transfers the
thermal energy to a thin porous wicking media saturated with water. As the secondary air passes
over the wet media, the water evaporates, cooling and humidifying the secondary airstream,
which is exhausted to the atmosphere. The process is not adiabatic since there is heat transfer
from the dry channel to the water ﬁlm in the wet channel.
As discussed earlier, the ambient wet bulb temperature is the lower limit to the outlet
temperature of a direct evaporative cooler. In contrast, another advantage of indirect evaporative
cooling is that the primary air stream can be cooled below its wet bulb temperature, and the wet
bulb temperature of the secondary air stream becomes the lower limit of the outlet temperature
of the primary air stream. The eﬀectiveness of an indirect evaporative cooler is deﬁned in the

There are many conﬁgurations of indirect evaporative coolers. Most conﬁgurations incor-
porate some types of staging and regeneration. A single-stage regenerative evaporative cooler
is shown in Figure 3.4. In this counterﬂow conﬁguration, the entering primary air is at tem-
perature T1. At the exit of the primary channel, a portion of the cooled exiting primary air at
temperature T2 is routed back to the secondary channel. As the air ﬂows along the secondary
channel, it is initially cooled and humidiﬁed by evaporation from the wet media in the secondary
channel. At state 3, the exit of the secondary channel, the air stream is exhausted to the atmo-
sphere. The temperature proﬁles in the primary and secondary channels are shown schematically
in Figure 3.5. The ambient air entering the primary channel is initially at temperature T1. The
exiting primary air is cooled to T2, below the ambient wet bulb temperature. The secondary air
initially decreases in temperature below T2 due to evaporative cooling, then its temperature in-
creases somewhat due to heat transfer from the liquid ﬁlm, and it exits the secondary channel
at temperature T3.

This cooling process is also shown on the psychrometric diagram in Figure 3.6. The tem-

secondary air, initially at T2, is humidiﬁed to saturation at state 3. It is initially evaporatively
cooled, then once saturated, is sensibly heated by the warmer liquid ﬁlm in the wetted media in

A two stage parallel ﬂow indirect evaporative cooler is shown in Figure 3.7. With this

ABSORPTION REFRIGERATION CYCLES
3.2.1
INTRODUCTION
Absorption refrigeration systems are used where a source of low-grade heat such as solar energy
or waste heat is available. The system components are more complex, thus more expensive, in an
absorption system relative to a vapor compression system, so absorption systems are used mainly

52
3. EVAPORATIVE, ABSORPTION, AND GAS COOLING CYCLES
in large industrial and commercial building applications and in situations where electricity is
not available, such as vacation homes, mobile homes and trailers. Absorption systems were the
primary refrigeration technology used in the U.S. until replaced by lower-cost vapor compression
systems in the early to mid-1900s.
A schematic of a basic absorption cycle is shown in Figure 3.9. A feature of this cycle is
that thermal energy instead of mechanical energy is the driving energy input. Three components
of the absorption cycle are the same as used in a vapor compression system, as absorption cycles
also have a condenser, evaporator, and expansion valve. As shown in Figure 3.9, an absorber
and generator are used in place of a compressor, and the compression of the refrigerant occurs
while it is in a liquid state, greatly reducing the pumping work. The cycle operates between two
pressure levels: low pressure at the evaporator and absorber, and high pressure at the condenser
and generator.

Figure 3.9: The absorption cycle.
There are two working ﬂuids in an absorption cycle, an absorbent, and a refrigerant. The
absorption cycle uses the solubility of a refrigerant gas in an absorbent liquid to reduce the pump-
ing energy required to compress the refrigerant. Absorption systems function on the principle
that liquid absorbents can attract and retain the vapor phase of a refrigerant at a relatively low
temperature, and that vapor solubility in an absorbent solution decreases as the solution temper-
ature is increased. Absorption systems operate at sub-atmospheric or vacuum conditions. The
refrigerant is absorbed at low pressure and temperature in the absorber, and driven oﬀas vapor
in the high pressure and temperature generator.
The two main absorbent/refrigerant combinations in use in absorption refrigeration cy-
cles are lithium bromide/water (LiBr/H2O) and water/ammonia (H2O/NH3). Water/ammonia

3.2. ABSORPTION REFRIGERATION CYCLES

mixtures are also called aqua ammonia or ammonium hydroxide. Other absorbents are lithium
chloride and zinc chloride.
Since water is used as the refrigerant, LiBr systems are used only in applications requiring
cooling at temperatures above 0ıC, i.e., air conditioning and process water cooling applications.
The vapor pressure of LiBr is very small, so the vapor produced in the generator is almost pure
water, and so there are no absorbent/refrigerant separation issues. Lithium bromide is nontoxic,
nonﬂammable, chemically stable, can be corrosive to most common piping materials when ex-
posed to air, and is also an irritant to skin and eyes.
The LiBr concentration in a LiBr/water mixture depends on the mixture or solution tem-
perature and the water saturation temperature. If saturation conditions are assumed, a curve-ﬁt
for the LiBr mass concentration valid for 0:50 < X < 0:65 is given by Equation (3.3) in units
of kgLiBr/kgmix:
X D 49:04 C 1:125 Tmix   Tsat
134:65 C 0:47 Tmix
:
(3.3)
If ammonia is used as the refrigerant, a water/ammonia absorption system can be used in
applications below 0ıC, as the freezing point of ammonia is  78ıC. Both ammonia and water
have a vapor pressure at standard operational temperatures. As thermal energy is added in the
generator, both the ammonia and water will vaporize, with the boiling temperature depending
on the local concentration. A vertical rectifying column is used to separate the ammonia vapor
from the water vapor. The water vapor has a higher saturation pressure than the ammonia, so
most of the water vapor will condense and drain back to the generator, and the ammonia vapor
will continue to rise through the rectiﬁer without condensing.
Toxicity and ﬂammability issues with ammonia require safeguards, adding to system cost
and complexity. Ammonia can be very irritating to the eyes, throat, and breathing passages in
small concentrations in air. The odor threshold for ammonia is between 5–50 parts per million
(ppm) of air, and the permissible exposure limit (PEL) is 50 ppm averaged over 8 hr.
3.2.2
ABSORPTION CYCLE OPERATION
The absorption cycle operation is detailed in Figure 3.9. The refrigerant vapor leaving the evap-
orator (state 1) ﬂows into the absorber and mixes with the absorbent liquid (state 8) sprayed at
low temperature into the absorber. The absorption process is exothermic since the refrigerant
vapor condenses into a liquid and goes into solution with the absorbent. For example, thermal
energy is released when lithium bromide is dissolved in water since it has a negative enthalpy of
solution.
Heat transfer from the absorber to the ambient removes the latent heat and the heat
of solution to maintain the low temperature ( 30ıC for LiBr) of the absorber. The “strong”
solution with a high concentration of refrigerant (state 5) is then pumped from the low pressure
absorber to the higher generator pressure at state 6, and ﬂows into the generator.

54
3. EVAPORATIVE, ABSORPTION, AND GAS COOLING CYCLES
In the generator, the refrigerant/absorbent solution is heated by an external heat source
which increases its temperature ( 100ıC for LiBr), causing the solubility of the refrigerant to
decrease, and to drive a portion of the refrigerant out of the solution, leaving a “weak” solution
with a higher concentration of absorbent. At state 2, the refrigerant vapor ﬂows into the con-
denser, where it condenses to state 3, through transfer of thermal energy PQcond to the ambient.
The pressure of the refrigerant is reduced by the expansion valve, from state 3 to state 4. In
the evaporator, there is heat transfer PQevap to the refrigerant, which evaporates and returns to
state 1. Meanwhile, the absorbent liquid in the generator at state 7 is throttled to the evapora-
tor pressure in a separate ﬂow loop with an expansion valve, and ﬂows back to the absorber at
state 8, completing the cycle.
The refrigerant and absorbent paths in the absorber and generator are plotted on the
equilibrium pressure-temperature-concentration chart in Figure 3.10. The solution temperature
is plotted on the x-axis, and the system pressure is plotted on the y-axis. The three constant
concentration lines are X D 0 (pure refrigerant), X D Xabs (absorber concentration), and X D
Xgen (generator concentration), respectively. The paths follow alternating constant concentration
and constant pressure lines. The refrigerant path is 1-5-6-2-1, and the absorbent path is 5-6-7-
8-5. Notice that as the solution temperature is increased at constant pressure, the concentration

of the refrigerant decreases due to the decreased solubility of the refrigerant in the absorbent,
so Xgen > Xabs.
3.2.3
ABSORPTION CYCLE ANALYSIS
The working ﬂuid of the absorption cycle has two components, the refrigerant and the absorbent.
Therefore, in addition to pressure and temperature, the analysis also needs to account for the mass
fraction or concentration X of the absorbent. In the analysis, we ﬁrst ﬁnd the concentration and
enthalpy at each point in the cycle for given pressures and temperatures, then apply the steady
open system continuity and energy equations to each of the cycle components to relate ﬂowrate
and heat transfer to enthalpy change.
Thermodynamic properties are needed for both the refrigerant and the absorbent. The
enthalpy of LiBr solutions as a function of concentration and temperature is given in Figure 3.11.
The enthalpy increases with increasing temperature and decreasing LiBr concentation.

The representative COP, between 0.6 and 0.75, for an absorption system is lower than that
for a vapor compression system with the same temperature conditions. However, if the generator
heat is provided from a solar collector or waste process heat, it is possible for the life cycle cost
of the absorption system to be competitive with higher COP vapor compression systems. In
addition, for many systems, a heat exchanger is used between the absorber and the generator for
heat recovery.
By adding an inert gas such as hydrogen to an ammonia-water vapor absorption, a cycle
can be created that does not require a mechanical pump.
Example 3.3 LiBr Chiller Performance Analysis
A LiBr/water chiller operates between an
evaporator temperature of 10ıC and a condenser temperature of 40ıC. The absorber temperature
is 30ıC and the generator temperature is 100ıC. The pump ﬂowrate is 0.60 kg/s. (a) What are

Solution
Assume that the exit conditions in the condenser and evaporator are saturated. If we neglect
pressure drops in the system piping, then the generator will operate at the same pressure as the
condenser, and the absorber will operate at the same pressure as the evaporator.

and the saturated liquid enthalpy h3 D h4 D 167:5 kJ/kg. At an evaporator temperature of
10ıC, the saturation pressure is 1.2 kPa, and the saturated vapor enthalpy h1 D 2519 kJ/kg.
The water vapor leaves the generator at 100ıC and 7.4 kPa, a superheated state with en-

GAS REFRIGERATION CYCLE
3.3.1
INTRODUCTION
The gas refrigeration cycle is a reversed Brayton cycle, named for George Brayton (1830–1892),
an American mechanical engineer. In contrast to the reversed vapor compression cycle, it op-
erates entirely in the superheated vapor regime, with no change of phase of the working ﬂuid.
The T-s diagram for the gas refrigeration cycle is shown in Figure 3.12. A major advantage of
the cycle is that the working ﬂuid, air (R-729), is non-toxic and freely available. However, gas
refrigeration systems have much lower COP values than comparably sized vapor compression
equipment, since the heat absorption and rejection is not isothermal.
The four basic processes in the ideal cycle are
1 to 2
isentropic gas compression in compressor from Pl to Ph
2 to 3
constant pressure heat rejection to the environment
3 to 4
isentropic gas expansion in turbine from Ph to Pl
4 to 1
constant pressure heat absorption from object or space to be cooled
Since it is relatively lightweight and compact, this cycle is used in aircraft cooling systems.
It is also used in cryogenic systems to liquify air and other gases. In the aircraft application, the
compressed air is drawn from the main gas turbine compressor, cooled, and expanded to pressure
Pl in a turbine, and then delivered to the aircraft cabin.

INTRODUCTION
In previous chapters, we have examined the thermodynamics of cooling cycles. Thermodynamic
analysis provides information about the cooling capacity of a system for given working ﬂuid and
environment temperatures. In this chapter we use heat transfer and ﬂuid mechanics analyses
to determine the actual size of the system components needed to meet the required cooling
capacity, and calculate the thermal performance of these components. For example, in a va-
por compression system, there are four basic mechanical components: a condenser, evaporator,
compressor, and an expansion device. Each of these components needs to be sized and then
assembled into a cooling system which will operate in a cycle to meet a given design cooling
load.
For each of these system components, the engineer has a wide range of alternative con-
ﬁgurations to choose from. Many pre-built cooling system packaged units are commercially
available, in which the various system components have been selected, balanced, assembled, and
charged with refrigerant for delivery of a working unit to a site. This is a simpler option relative
to selection of the individual components, however, the match with the design load may not be
exact.
The uniﬁed package of vapor compression components (compressor, evaporator, con-
denser, and expansion device) used to produce chilled water for air conditioning of commercial
buildings is deﬁned as a chiller. A split package air conditioner is deﬁned as a cooling system
with the evaporator and condenser in separate locations.
4.2
HEAT EXCHANGERS
We begin with heat exchangers, since they are common to all of the cooling cycles examined.
Heat exchangers are used in cooling systems to transfer thermal energy from a “hot” ﬂuid to
a “cold” ﬂuid. For example, in a vapor compression system the working ﬂuid in the evaporator
absorbs thermal energy from the object or space to be cooled through evaporation from a liquid
to a vapor. In the condenser, the working ﬂuid transfers thermal energy to the environment
through condensation from a vapor to a liquid.
In refrigeration systems where the temperatures are below 0ıC, and secondary refrigerant
loops are needed, brine solutions are used to lower the freezing point of the working ﬂuid. A
brine is a solution of water and an inorganic salt, either sodium chloride or calcium chloride.

62
4. COOLING EQUIPMENT
Sodium chloride and propylene glycol are compatible with food materials. However, calcium
chloride and ethylene glycol are not recommended for food-related applications.
There are many types of heat exchanger geometries used in cooling systems, the three
most common geometries used in cooling systems being counterﬂow, crossﬂow, and shell and
tube. Counterﬂow heat exchangers are used when both sides of the heat exchanger are liquids. A
schematic of a counterﬂow conﬁguration is shown in Figure 4.1. The hot and cold liquids enter
the heat exchanger from opposite sides, so that depending on the ﬂow rate ratio, it is possible for
the cold side outlet temperature to be greater than the hot side outlet temperature, as illustrated
in Figure 4.2. With a tube-in-tube counterﬂow heat exchanger, water ﬂows in the inner tube
and the refrigerant ﬂows in the opposite direction in the annular space between the inner and
outer tubes.

Crossﬂow heat exchangers are used when one or more of the ﬂuids is a gas. In a crossﬂow
heat exchanger, as shown in Figure 4.3, the liquid ﬂow is through ﬁnned tubes which are ar-
ranged perpendicular to the gas ﬂow. Fins are placed on the exterior of the tubes to increase the
gas side heat transfer coeﬃcient. The cooling coils in air conditioning systems are ﬁnned tubes

in cross ﬂow, with chilled water or refrigerant ﬂowing inside the tubes, and air ﬂowing outside
the tubes.
Shell and tube heat exchangers are used in large condensers and evaporators. A shell and
tube heat exchanger has tubes arranged in a symmetric pattern inside a cylindrical shell. A
schematic of a shell and tube condenser with one refrigerant shell pass and two water passes
is shown in Figure 4.4. Manifolds in the end plates direct the water ﬂow into the tubes, and
baﬄes in the shell direct the shell ﬂow past the tubes.
4.2.1
HEAT TRANSFER IN HEAT EXCHANGERS
The rate of thermal energy transport in the heat exchangers of cooling systems is a function of
the heat transfer mechanism, ﬂuid properties, and the heat exchanger size and geometry. The
primary mechanisms of sensible heat transfer in condensers and evaporators are conduction and
convection, with radiation playing a insigniﬁcant role.
The conduction heat transfer across a solid such as a pipe wall is given by Equation (4.1):
PQ D kA.T1   T2/=L;
(4.1)
where k is the thermal conductivity (W/m-K), A is the cross sectional area (m2), and T1   T2
is the temperature diﬀerence (ıC) across the thickness L (m).

Liquid

Figure 4.4: Schematic of a shell and tube condenser.
The convection heat transfer between a solid and a ﬂuid such as water ﬂowing in a tube is
given by Newton’s convection equation, Equation (4.2)
PQ D hA.T1   T2/;
(4.2)
where h is the heat transfer coeﬃcient (W/m2-K), A is the ﬂuid/solid contact area (m2), and
T1   T2 is the temperature diﬀerence (ıC) between the ﬂuid and the solid.
A heat transfer resistance network is used to model and analyze the heat transfer paths in
a heat exchanger. The thermal energy transport from a hot ﬂuid to a cool ﬂuid will have both
series and parallel convective and conductive paths, with the thermal resistance represented by
electrical resistors. For a simple series conﬁguration, the overall heat transfer coeﬃcient U is
deﬁned as
1
U D 1

C L
k C 1
h2
(4.3)
and the overall heat transfer PQ from the hot ﬂuid (1) to the cold ﬂuid (2) is
PQ D UA.T1   T2/:
(4.4)
If the heat transfer geometry is two-dimensional with changes in the cross-sectional area, such
as is the case for small diameter pipes, then the local area changes need to be taken into account
in formulating the overall heat transfer coeﬃcient.
The heat transfer coeﬃcient depends on the type of convection. Natural convection results
from buoyancy forces created by the surface being at a diﬀerent temperature than the ﬂuid, forced
convection results from an external pressure diﬀerence created by a pump, fan, or wind. Boiling
heat transfer results from a change of phase from a liquid to a vapor when a liquid contacts a
surface with a temperature greater than the saturation temperature of the liquid. Condensation

4.2. HEAT EXCHANGERS
65
heat transfer is the reverse of boiling, and results from a change of phase when a vapor contacts
a surface with a temperature less than the saturation temperature of the vapor.
The values of the convection heat transfer coeﬃcient are found from dimensionless cor-
relations that include the ﬂow geometry, ﬂuid properties and velocities. For forced convection,
the correlations are of the form
Nu D a RebPrc;
(4.5)
where a, b, and c are found from correlation of experimental data. The correlation parameters
are
Nu D Nusselt Number D hD=k

For example, the correlation for turbulent ﬂow in a pipe with Re > 10,000, with the ﬂuid
being heated is
Nu D 0:023 Re4=5Pr0:4:
(4.7)
4.2.2
HEAT EXCHANGER ANALYSIS
There are two main analysis techniques for heat exchangers. They are designated as the Log
Mean T method, and the Eﬀectiveness-Number of Transfer Units (   NTU) method. Both
techniques use the energy equation and Newton’s convection equation to relate the heat transfer
to the mass ﬂow rates and temperatures of the hot and cold ﬂuids.
The    NTU method is more widely used for heat exchanger design and selection, since
it only requires the inlet temperatures of the hot and cold ﬂuids as inputs. The heat exchanger
eﬀectiveness  is deﬁned as the ratio of the actual heat transfer to the maximum possible heat
transfer.

For condensers and evaporators, if we assume the superheating and subcooling heat transfer is

Given , Thi, and Tci, the actual heat transfer rate can be expressed as

geometry. The condenser needs to be sized to transfer PQh D 5.0 kW of thermal energy. The
working refrigerant is R-134a at a condensing temperature of 44ıC. The overall heat transfer
coeﬃcient U is 500 W/m2-K, and the diameter D of the thin walled ﬁnned tube is 30 mm.
The air, initially at 20ıC, has a temperature rise of 10ıC, and has a speciﬁc heat of 1000 J/kg-K.

CONDENSERS
4.3.1
INTRODUCTION
The condenser operates on the high temperature, high pressure side of the cooling cycle. Since
the condenser transfers the thermal energy extracted from the refrigerated object and from the
compressor to the environment, the working ﬂuid needs to be at a greater temperature than the
environment. From the ﬁrst law applied to the cooling cycle, the thermal energy rejected to the
environment is the sum of the evaporator heat transfer PQl and the pump or compressor work
PW :

The working ﬂuid enters the condenser as a superheated vapor and leaves as a condensed
liquid. Most of the heat transfer is isothermal, however, there are usually a few degrees of desu-
perheating of the entering vapor and subcooling of the exiting liquid ﬂow.
The thermal energy to be transferred from the condenser is transferred to the atmosphere
directly using an air cooled condenser or indirectly using a cooling tower. The choice of con-
denser depends primarily on the application and capacity required. The three major types of

68
4. COOLING EQUIPMENT
condensers are air-cooled, liquid-cooled, and evaporative-cooled. The heat transfer coeﬃcient
on the condensing side of the heat exchanger is of the order of 10,000 W/m2-K, so the major
resistance to heat transfer is on the environment air/water side.
Air-cooled condensers are used in domestic refrigeration and air conditioning systems
with capacities less than 500 kW. They are cross ﬂow heat exchangers that use a ﬁnned tube
geometry. The refrigerant vapor enters at the top, and the condensing liquid ﬂows by gravity to
the exit at the bottom.
For applications requiring capacities of about 200–1000 W, the heat transfer to the air
can be provided by natural convection. Example applications are domestic refrigerators, freez-
ers, small commercial, and laboratory equipment. Natural convection condensers are constructed
with bare or ﬁnned tubing, or tubes attached to thin panels. The condenser is located a few cen-
timeters oﬀthe back of the unit to establish a natural convection chimney eﬀect. The refrigerant
enters the top of the condenser as a vapor and condenses to a liquid as it ﬂows downward under
the action of gravity. As the air outside the tube is heated by the condenser, it rises due to its
increased buoyancy, and is replaced by cooler air entering at the bottom of the condenser.
Single stage axial ﬂow fans are used in rooftop air-cooled condensers for buildings with
required cooling capacities greater than 5–10 kW, and are shown schematically in Figure 4.5.
The fans provide forced convection air ﬂow either vertically or horizontally over a ﬁnned tube
geometry. Fins are used on the air side of the condenser to reduce the thermal resistance and
increase the heat transfer rate. As shown in Figure 4.5, multiple fans are used to reduce noise
and modulate load. The temperature rise of the ambient air stream is designed to be of the order
of 10 K or less to maintain an acceptable temperature diﬀerence across the condenser.

Cooling systems with a required capacity greater than 100 kW generally also use liquid
cooling, since water has a much greater heat capacity and density than air. Smaller condenser
conﬁgurations use a double-walled pipe operated with the refrigerant being in the annulus.
Larger condenser conﬁgurations use a shell and tube, with water in the tube, and the refrigerant
vapor condensing to a liquid in the shell, as illustrated in Figure 4.4 presented in the previous
section. Hot refrigerant vapor enters at the top of the shell, condensing when it comes into
contact with the cold surface of the water tubes or coils. The condensed refrigerant drips oﬀthe
coils, collecting in the bottom of the shell, which also serves as a receiver tank.
In a liquid-cooled condenser, the liquid side temperature rise .T2   T1/ is typically of the
order of 5–10 K, and the mass ﬂowrate Pmw of the water is found from an energy balance on the
liquid side:

(4.25)
When superheated refrigerant vapor comes into contact with the cold walls of a condenser, the
vapor condenses into droplets. In a horizontal tube, as the vapor condenses, it forms a liquid ﬁlm
on the tube wall. The liquid ﬁlm ﬂows downward and pools at the bottom of the tube, and the
shear force from the vapor ﬂow pushes the liquid pool downstream along the tube. The vapor
mass fraction, i.e., quality, decreases from 1 to 0 from the entrance to the exit of the tube.
The heat transfer coeﬃcient in condensation processes depends on the saturation and tube
wall temperatures, refrigerant properties and the vapor velocity. If the vapor Reynolds number

4.3.3
EVAPORATIVE CONDENSERS
Evaporative condensers are a combination of an air-cooled condenser and a cooling tower. In
addition to a cooling air ﬂow, they use a water spray onto the outside of the condenser tube bank
to cool and condense the refrigerant inside the tubes. The heat transferred from the condensing
refrigerant evaporates the water ﬁlm on the condenser tubes and increases the temperature of
the air stream.
Water is pumped from a sump at the bottom of the unit to nozzles located at the top, and
then sprayed as a mist onto the condenser tubes. The water that does not evaporate falls under
gravity back to the sump. Thus both the temperature and the humidity of the air stream increase.
The rate of heat transfer depends on both the dry bulb and the wet bulb temperature of the inlet
air stream. As the inlet air temperature decreases, the the condenser eﬀectiveness increases.
4.4
EVAPORATORS
4.4.1
INTRODUCTION
The evaporator operates on the low temperature, low pressure side of the cooling cycle, absorbing
thermal energy from the space or object to be cooled. Since it is in thermal contact with the
cooling load, the refrigerant enters the evaporator as a two phase liquid, and leaves as a vapor.
The working ﬂuid on the hot side of the evaporator is usually air or water. There are many
conﬁgurations used for evaporators, depending on the application and capacity required.
For air-cooled evaporators, the most common conﬁguration is direct expansion (DX) us-
ing ﬁnned tube heat exchangers in which the refrigerant ﬂow in the tubes is evaporated by the
heat transfer from the hot air stream ﬂowing around the tubes. The tube geometries used are
bare tube, ﬁnned tube, and plate-type. One conﬁguration of plate type evaporators uses two
sheets of corrugated metal that are bonded together to form channels for the refrigerant ﬂow.
Another conﬁguration widely used in refrigerator trucks consists of tubes sandwiched between
two plates. Finned tube evaporators are made by bonding metal plates or ﬁns to a bare tube to
increase the heat transfer surface area. The ﬁn spacing varies from about 2 mm on a domestic
air conditioning unit to 10 mm for a cold room heat exchanger. The ﬁnned tubes are horizontal,
with vertical ﬁns to allow defrosting and drainage of condensed moisture in air ﬂow conditions
below the dew or frost points.
The air circulating on the “hot” side ﬂows by either natural or forced convection. A cross-
ﬂow geometry is used in which the air ﬂow is perpendicular across the tubes. The ﬂow arrange-
ments on the refrigerant side are of a series or parallel conﬁguration. Small capacity evaporators
such as domestic refrigerators use a single tube, and larger capacity evaporators use a parallel
ﬂow geometry with multiple tubes to reduce the pressure drop across the evaporator.
For liquid-cooled evaporators, a common conﬁguration is a shell and tube heat exchanger.
The tubes can be straight, U-shaped, or coiled. For cooling loads less than 500 kW, the refrig-
erant ﬂow is generally inside the tubes, termed dry expansion, and the water or brine is in the

72
4. COOLING EQUIPMENT
shell. The refrigerant evaporation process is convective boiling inside the tubes. To prevent liquid
droplets from entering the compressor, dry expansion evaporators will superheat the refriger-
ant vapor a few degrees above saturation. The overall heat transfer coeﬃcient U is of the order
of 500–1200 W/m2-K for dry expansion evaporators. This conﬁguration is also used for ice
manufacture, where ice forms on the outside of the evaporator coils.
For larger cooling loads above 500 kW, the refrigerant is generally on the shell side, with
a circulating liquid originating from the cooling load passing through the tubes, as shown in the
schematic in Figure 4.6. This arrangement is termed a ﬂooded evaporator, since the refrigerant
liquid level is maintained high enough so the tubes are always covered by liquid refrigerant.
The tubes at top of the shell are removed to reduce entrainment of the liquid refrigerant by
the boiling vapor. The liquid level can be maintained constant using a ﬂoat valve external to
the evaporator. The overall heat transfer coeﬃcient U is of the order of 700–1200 W/m2-K for
ﬂooded evaporators.

Figure 4.6: Flooded shell and tube evaporator.
In a ﬂooded evaporator, the water ﬂowing in the tubes will decrease in temperature, typi-
cally 5–10ıC, so the wall temperature is not constant. Consequently, the resulting heat transfer
is a combination of nucleate boiling, natural convection, and evaporation from the surface of
the pool at the top of the shell. The exterior surface of the tubes need to be about 10ıC above
the saturation temperature for nucleate boiling to occur. In nucleate pool boiling, vapor bubbles
form on the tube surface, grow in size, and detach when their buoyancy exceeds the surface ten-
sion restoring force. The bubble detachment from the tube agitates the pool of liquid refrigerant
and provides a mechanism for a microlayer of colder liquid refrigerant to begin forming a new
bubble on the surface of the tube.

BOILING HEAT TRANSFER
The nucleate boiling heat transfer coeﬃcient Nh on the exterior surface of the tubes depends on
a number of factors, including the tube wall—ﬂuid saturation temperature diﬀerence, Ts   Tsat,
surface ﬁnish, and ﬂuid properties. The heat transfer correlations are of the form
Nh D C .Ts   Tsat/n:
(4.35)
Since the heat transfer coeﬃcient is a function of the temperature diﬀerence to some power,
the correlations are expressed directly in terms of the heat ﬂux PQ=A. A widely used correlation
(Rohsenow [1998]) is given in Equation (4.36). Note the correlation is independent of the tube

COOLING COILS
A cooling coil is a tubular multipass crossﬂow heat exchanger that both cools and dehumidiﬁes
an air stream. Cooling coils have a large face area on the air side of the heat exchanger, and a
smaller ﬂow area on the liquid side. In large HVAC systems with a central chiller, chilled water is
circulated to numerous cooling coils located in diﬀerent building zones. The chilled water ﬂows
inside the tubes and the supply air ﬂows over the tubes, with heat transfer from the air to the
cooling water.
If the temperature of the air side of the coil surface is above the air dew point temperature,
there will not be any condensation of the water vapor in the air, and the tube surface will remain
dry. Since there is only sensible cooling of the air, the cooling coil performance can be determined
using a “dry” analysis. However, if the temperature of the air side of the coil surface is below the
air dew point temperature, there will be condensation of the water vapor in the air onto the tube,
and the tube surface will be “wet.” The performance of a “wet” coil is found from convection
heat and mass transfer analyses that include both sensible and latent cooling. The additional
parameters include the enthalpy of the saturated air-water vapor mixture at the tube surface,
and the enthalpy of the air stream at a distance away from the tube surface.
The mean temperature and humidity change for moist air ﬂowing through a wet cooling
coil is shown in Figure 4.7. The moist air that initially contacts the cold coil will reach and then
drop below the dew point while the mean air temperature remains above the dew point.

4.6. COOLING TOWERS
75
Therefore, the absolute humidity of the air will continually drop as the air cools and eventually
reaches the saturation line.
With a direct expansion (DX) cooling coil, liquid refrigerant ﬂows directly in the tubes
of the cooling coil, and evaporates into the vapor phase, cooling the air stream. A ﬁnned-tube
heat exchanger is used in DX systems. Heat transfer from a hot air stream originating from the
cooling load will evaporate the liquid refrigerant passing through the tube. Air-cooled evapo-
rators operating below 0ıC will accumulate frost from water vapor solidifying on the coils, so
arrangements must be made for periodic frost removal, such as electric heaters or reverse cycling.
Performance data for cooling coils is obtained from manufacturer’s catalogs. The catalogs
provide data on wet coil heat and mass transfer, and leaving dry and wet bulb temperature for
given entering air dry and wet bulb temperatures. For determination of building air conditioning
needs, the air is assumed to leave the cooling coil at 12.8ıC (55ıF) with a relative humidity about
0.90, and the liquid entering the tube side of the cooling coil is typically assumed to be 6.7ıC
(44ıF). Since the dew point for air at 23.9ıC (75ıF) and 50% relative humidity is 12.8ıC (55ıF),
there will be some dehumidiﬁcation of the occupied space with a cooling coil.
4.6
COOLING TOWERS
With large (> 500 kW) vapor compression and absorption cooling systems, the thermal energy
absorbed by the water on the cooling side of the condenser is transferred to a cooling tower for
rejection to the atmosphere. In the cooling tower, thermal energy is transferred from the water
to the atmosphere by evaporation of a portion of the water in the form of droplets.
The mechanical draft cooling tower is used in most large cooling systems. This is a conﬁg-
uration in which water is sprayed downward into an upward ﬂowing air stream driven by fans.
Fans are located at the top of the tower in a induced-draft cooling tower, as shown in Figure 4.8,
and at the bottom of the tower in a forced-draft tower. Induced-draft cooling towers are pre-
ferred, as forced-draft towers can have issues with freezing and short circuiting. In a crossﬂow
mechanical draft cooling tower, the airﬂow is horizontal, and thus perpendicular to the down-
ward ﬂowing water stream. The heat transfer capacity of the cooling tower is controlled in part
load operation by adjusting the fan speed.
The inside of the cooling tower is ﬁlled with packing material such as porous plastic sheets
to maximize the contact surface area between the air and the water. The water is cooled since it
is used to provide the latent heat of evaporation of the water ﬁlm and droplets. Make up water is
needed to replace the evaporative water loss. The ﬂow rate of water is maintained high enough
so that the make up water ﬂow rate is a very small proportion of the overall water ﬂow rate.
As discussed previously, with direct evaporative cooling, the lowest temperature that the
water can reach is the wet bulb temperature of the incoming air. The 1% wet bulb design tem-
perature for a given location is usually chosen for the design entering air condition.

COMPRESSORS
4.7.1
INTRODUCTION
The types of compressors used in refrigeration and air conditioning applications can be grouped
into ﬁve categories: reciprocating, centrifugal, rotary, scroll, and screw. The type of compressor
chosen depends on the speciﬁc application, capacity and eﬃciency required. Rotary and scroll
compressors are used in smaller capacity residential and vehicular air conditioning and refriger-
ation applications. Reciprocating, centrifugal, and screw compressors are used in larger capacity
commercial air conditioning and refrigeration.
Compressor capacity maps are provided by manufacturers for compressor selection to meet
a given cooling load. There is capacity overlap between the compressor categories. Rotary com-
pressors are used in cooling systems requiring between 1 kW and 5 kW, reciprocating com-
pressors between 1 and 500 kW, scroll compressors between 5 and 50 kW, screw compressors
between 50 and 500 kW, and centrifugal compressors between 200 and 10,000 kW. Small ca-
pacity compressors in residential applications are bundled with an electric motor in a common
package called a hermetic compressor. The refrigerant is used to cool the electric motor, so the
compression process is not adiabatic.

4.7.2
RECIPROCATING COMPRESSORS
The reciprocating compressor uses a piston-cylinder geometry, and is the most commonly used
compressor type. As shown in Figure 4.9, it consists of a crankshaft connected to a piston by
a connecting rod. Driven by the rotating crankshaft, the piston oscillates up and down in the
cylinder with stroke s and bore b. Depending on the capacity required, reciprocating compressors
can have more than one cylinder, driven by a single crankshaft.

Valves are used to control the ﬂow of refrigerant vapor into and out of the cylinder. The
valves are of reed or poppet type design. The reed valves operate by diﬀerential pressure, so the
inlet valve does not open until the pressure in the cylinder drops below the pressure in the inlet
line from the evaporator. Piston rings are used to seal the piston and maintain the compression
pressure in the cylinder.
The compression process is shown on the P   V diagram of Figure 4.10. From state 1–2
the refrigerant enters the cylinder through the inlet valve during the inlet or suction stroke. At
bottom dead center, the piston speed goes to zero, so the inlet ﬂow and pressure drop across
the inlet valve also decrease. As the piston moves upward, the cylinder pressure increases, the
inlet valve closes, and the refrigerant is compressed during the compression stroke from 2–3.

Near top dead center, the outlet valve opens and the compressed refrigerant ﬂow into the outlet

The clearance volume at state 4 will contain residual refrigerant which will mix with the
inlet gas when the inlet valve opens. As the piston moves away from top dead center, no new
gas will be drawn into the cylinder until the cylinder pressure drops to the suction pressure at
state 1.

Typical values of v for reciprocating compressors range from 0.75–0.9. The volumetric eﬃ-
ciency is aﬀected by the clearance factor, the pressure drop across the inlet valve, heat transfer
from the cylinder walls, and gas leakage past the piston rings, which will decrease the density of
the inlet charge during during the intake stroke from i to an average value N. One method of
control for reciprocating compressors is to vary the clearance factor by opening/closing clearance
valve pockets which will change the volumetric eﬃciency and thus the refrigerant ﬂowrate.
We can do a simple calculation to estimate the eﬀect of the above parameters on the
volumetric eﬃciency by assuming a polytropic expansion with exponent k of the residual gas

CENTRIFUGAL COMPRESSORS
The centrifugal compressor is a turbomachine with a continuously ﬂowing working ﬂuid. It uses
a rotating impeller to add tangential velocity to the working ﬂuid which is converted to a head
or pressure rise in a scroll or volute through an increase in the ﬂow cross sectional area. Since the
ﬂow through the compressor is continuous, centrifugal compressors have a greater volumetric
capacity than positive displacement compressors. The capacity of a centrifugal compressor is very
sensitive to the evaporator and condenser temperatures of a vapor compression system.
Centrifugal compressors are sized to meet 200–10,000 kW of cooling capacity. The larger
centrifugal compressor systems are built up as package units comprising the condenser, evapora-
tor, and compressor into a single unit. Typically, two or more impeller stages are used in HVAC
applications, since the diameter of the impeller would be too large to operate at the tip velocity
required for a single stage. Depending on the pressure ratio required, the compression can be up
to eight stages. The impeller rotational velocity is usually in the 3500–7600 rpm range.
A schematic diagram of the side of a single stage centrifugal compressor is given in Fig-
ure 4.11, and a schematic of a section of the impeller is is given in Figure 4.12. As shown in
Figure 4.11, the refrigerant gas enters the impeller axially, and exits radially.
Using the control volume momentum and energy equations, we can develop relations for
the power consumption and pressure rise in a centrifugal compressor as a function of the ﬂow
rate and impeller geometry. Inlet and exit velocity diagrams across the compressor impeller are
given in Figure 4.13. The absolute velocity is given by V , the velocity of the ﬂow relative to the
impeller is given by W , and the impeller velocity is U D !r.

For the impeller blade geometry, the inlet blade angle is ˇ1, and the exit blade angle is
ˇ2. For the design load condition, the tangential component of the inlet velocity is V1t is usually
assumed to be zero, so V1n D V1. For part load conditions, inlet vanes in the compressor housing
upstream of the impeller are used to impart a swirl to the inlet ﬂow which will reduce the angular
momentum added to the ﬂow. The inlet portion of the blades are forward curved, with ˇ1 < 90ı,
so the relative velocity of the incoming ﬂow is tangent to the vanes, as shown in Figure 4.13.

constant adiabatic eﬃciency and constant speed are also plotted. Note that as the ﬂowrate in-

Figure 4.14: Representative centrifugal compressor map.
Centrifugal compressors have surge and choking performance limits. The surge limit on
the left side of the compressor map represents a boundary between stable and unstable operating
points. For stable operation compressors operate to the right of the surge line, with a negative
slope to the constant speed lines. Surge is a self-sustaining ﬂow oscillation. When the mass
ﬂow rate is reduced at constant pressure ratio, a point arises where somewhere within the inter-
nal boundary layers on the compressor blades a ﬂow reversal occurs. If the ﬂow rate is further
reduced, then a complete reversal occurs which relieves the adverse pressure gradient. That re-
lief means a ﬂow reversal is no longer needed and the ﬂow then begins to return to its initial
condition. When the initial condition is reached, the process will repeat itself, creating surge.

4.7. COMPRESSORS
85
This feature makes the centrifugal compressor very sensitive to the condenser pressure. Hot gas
bypass is used to extend the surge limit.
On the right side of the dynamic compressor map is a zone where eﬃciencies fall rapidly
with increasing mass ﬂow rate. The gas speeds are quite high in this zone and the attendant
ﬂuid friction losses are increasing with the square of the gas speed. In this region there is also
the choke limit which occurs at a slightly diﬀerent value of Pm= Pmcr for each tip speed. Choking
occurs when at some point within the compressor the ﬂow reaches the speed of sound. It occurs
at values of Pm= Pmcr less than 1 because Pmcr is based on the compressor wheel diameter D rather
than on the cross sectional area where choking is occurring. The value of Pm= Pmcr at choking varies
with tip speed because the location within the compressor at which choking occurs depends on
the structure of the internal boundary layers.
The centrifugal compressor performance curves can also be used for system control. For
example, in the case of a compressor with constant condenser pressure P2, as the external load
decreases, the evaporator pressure P1 will decrease, the pressure ratio will correspondingly in-
crease, and the compressor will operate at a lower ﬂow rate, following the constant speed line.
When it is necessary to decrease the ﬂow rate at a constant evaporator temperature T1, a similar
result can be produced by increasing the condenser temperature T2, which is accomplished by
reducing the condenser water ﬂow rate.
Example 4.5
Centrifugal Compressor Pressure Ratio
A two stage centrifugal compressor
has an impeller with a radius of 0.45 m which is directly connected to a motor operating at
3350 rpm. The exit ﬂow from the impeller is radial (ˇ2 D 90ı). The compressor isentropic
eﬃciency is 0.80. Refrigerant R-134a is the working ﬂuid, and the saturation temperature
in the evaporator is 0ıC. What is the pressure ratio in the compressor, and the correspond-
ing condenser saturation temperature? Assume the thermophysical properties of R-134a are
cp D 852 J/kg and  D 1:106.

For two stages, the pressure ratio is therefore (2.36) (2.36) D 5.57. From R-134a tables, the

The saturation temperature at that pressure is T2 D 51:3ıC.
4.7.4
COMPRESSOR LUBRICATION
Since compressors are mechanical devices with metal parts that slide or rotate, they require
lubrication to reduce piston and bearing friction, and increase refrigerant sealing. Lubrication
oils are paraﬃn, i.e., mineral oil based.
During the compression stroke of a reciprocating compressor, some of the lubricating oil
on the cylinder wall will be entrained as droplets and will pass out with the discharge gas. An oil
separator is frequently used in the compressor discharge line to reduce the amount of entrained
oil. The separation process is accomplished by droplet impingement on a ﬂat plate or centrifugal
rotation, typically with 95–98% eﬃciency.
The remaining oil will pass through the condenser, and the expansion valve, and enter the
evaporator. In the evaporator, the refrigerant will vaporize, and the oil will remain liquid. The
amount of oil accumulation depends on the miscibility of the oil and refrigerant. Lubrication
oil is fully miscible with R-134a, and non-miscible with R-717 (Ammonia). With ammonia as
the working ﬂuid, the accumulated lubrication oil will sink to the bottom of the condenser and
evaporator, and can be drained directly.
4.8
EXPANSION VALVES
Expansion devices are used in vapor compression systems to create the pressure drop between
the high and low pressure sides of the system, and also control the refrigerant ﬂow rate. The
expansion valve controls the ﬂow of the refrigerant from the high pressure condenser to the low
pressure evaporator. The type of expansion valve chosen depends on the evaporator operation.
Major types are a ﬁxed area restrictor, constant pressure expansion valve, thermostatic expansion
valve, and electric expansion valve.
Flooded evaporators use a solenoid valve for the pressure reduction coupled to a ﬂoat valve
for on-oﬀcontrol of the liquid level in the evaporator. When the liquid level in the evaporator
reaches the set point, the ﬂoat valve closes, shutting of the ﬂow of refrigerant to the evapo-
rator. As the liquid level decreases, the ﬂoat valve opens, allowing refrigerant to ﬂow into the
evaporator.
Dry expansion evaporators use thermostatic expansion valves, designed to maintain a con-
stant amount of superheat in the vapor at the evaporator outlet. Since it is important to avoid

4.8. EXPANSION VALVES
87
liquid refrigerant entering the compressor, the refrigerant leaving the evaporator is superheated
by about 5ıC. As indicated in Figure 4.15, the valve contains a moveable diaphragm attached
to a spring and valve, sensitive to the pressure taps above and below the diaphragm. A tem-
perature and pressure sensor bulb is located at the outlet of the evaporator which is connected
above the diaphragm, so the pressure above the diaphragm is equal to the superheated pressure
at the evaporator outlet. The pressure below the diaphragm is the pressure at the inlet of the
evaporator, i.e., the saturation pressure of the refrigerant.

Figure 4.15: Cross-section of thermostatic valve.
The operation of the thermostatic expansion valve is as follows. The diaphragm moves in
response to the diﬀerence in pressures across the diaphragm. An adjustable spring balances this
pressure diﬀerential, so that if the pressure diﬀerential changes, the spring will open or close the
valve accordingly. For example, as the temperature and thus the pressure in the bulb increases
due to an increase in the cooling load, the pressure above the diaphragm increases, the valve will
open further, and increase the ﬂow of refrigerant to the evaporator. An increase in refrigerant
ﬂowrate will lower the evaporator exit temperature back to the set point.
Small capacity systems such as domestic refrigerators use ﬁxed area capillary tubes. which
are small diameter tubes used to produce the required pressure drop. They are passive devices
sized for the required pressure drop for a single operating point, and have a limited ability to
regulate refrigerant ﬂow in response to changes in cooling load. The pressure drop in the capillary
tube can be predicted accurately for a known ﬂuid viscosity. As the pressure of the ﬂuid along the
capillary tube decreases, some of the liquid refrigerant will vaporize, resulting in a two-phase

88

liquid ﬂow in the tube. A ﬁxed oriﬁce can also be used to produce the needed pressure drop.
Additional system control is achieved by on-oﬀmotor control.
Since the expansion valve creates an energy loss in the cooling cycle, there have been
attempts to use turbines instead of valves to extract work from the pressure drop, similar to a
gas turbine or Brayton cycle. However, while technically feasible, there is additional complexity
and cost which makes such approaches not commercially viable.
