The following information is for FCC compliance of Class A devices: This equipment has been tested and found 
to comply with the limits for a Class A digital device, pursuant to part 15 of the FCC rules. These limits are 
designed to provide reasonable protection against harmful interference when the equipment is operated in a 
commercial environment. This equipment generates, uses, and can radiate radio-frequency energy and, if not 
installed and used in accordance with the instruction manual, may cause harmful interference to radio 
communications. Operation of this equipment in a residential area is likely to cause harmful interference, in 
which case users will be required to correct the interference at their own expense. 
The following information is for FCC compliance of Class B devices: The equipment described in this manual generates 
and may radiate radio-frequency energy. If it is not installed in accordance with Cisco’s installation instructions, it may 

cause interference with radio and television reception. This equipment has been tested and found to comply with the 
limits for a Class B digital device in accordance with the specifications in part 15 of the FCC rules. These specifications 
are designed to provide reasonable protection against such interference in a residential installation. However, there is no 
guarantee that interference will not occur in a particular installation. 
Modifying the equipment without Cisco’s written authorization may result in the equipment no longer complying with 
FCC requirements for Class A or Class B digital devices. In that event, your right to use the equipment may be limited by 
FCC regulations, and you may be required to correct any interference to radio or television communications at your own 
expense.
You can determine whether your equipment is causing interference by turning it off. If the interference stops, it was 
probably caused by the Cisco equipment or one of its peripheral devices. If the equipment causes interference to radio or 
television reception, try to correct the interference by using one or more of the following measures:
• Turn the television or radio antenna until the interference stops.
• Move the equipment to one side or the other of the television or radio.
• Move the equipment farther away from the television or radio.
• Plug the equipment into an outlet that is on a different circuit from the television or radio. (That is, make certain the 
equipment and the television or radio are on circuits controlled by different circuit breakers or fuses.) 
Modifications to this product not authorized by Cisco Systems, Inc. could void the FCC approval and negate your 
authority to operate the product.

Adaptive Security Algorithm
This section discusses the Adaptive Security Algorithm (ASA) and the ASA 
security levels.
© 2000, Cisco Systems, Inc. 
www.cisco.com
CSPFA 1.01—2-4
Adaptive Security Algorithm
(ASA)
Adaptive Security Algorithm
(ASA)
• Implements stateful connection control through the
PIX Firewall
• Allows one-way (inside to outside) connections
without an explicit configuration for each internal
system and application
• Monitors return packets to ensure they are valid
• Randomizes the TCP sequence number to minimize
the risk of attack
The ASA is a stateful approach to security. Every inbound packet is checked 
against the ASA and against connection state information in the PIX Firewall’s 
memory. Knowledge of the ASA is fundamental to implementing Internet access 
security because it performs the following tasks:
I
Implements stateful connection control through the PIX Firewall
I
Allows one-way (inside to outside) connections without an explicit 
configuration for each internal system application
I
Monitors return packets to ensure they are valid
I
Randomizes the TCP sequence number to minimize the risk of attack
ASA maintains the secure perimeters between the networks controlled by the PIX 
Firewall. The stateful connection-oriented ASA design creates session flows 
based on source and destination addresses. ASA randomizes TCP sequence 
numbers, port numbers, and TCP flags before the completion of the connection. 
This function is always running, monitoring return packets to ensure that they are 
valid.

The ASA security levels designate whether an interface is inside (trusted) or 
outside (untrusted) relative to another interface. An interface is considered inside 
in relation to another interface if its security level is higher than that of the other 
interface, and is considered outside in relation to another interface if its security 
level is lower than that of the other interface.
The primary rule for security levels is that an interface with a higher security level 
can access an interface with a lower security level. Conversely, an interface with a 
lower security level cannot access an interface with a higher security level without 
a conduit (discussed later). Security levels range from 0 to 100 The following are 
more specific rules for these security levels:
I
Security level 100—This is the highest security level for the inside interface 
of the PIX Firewall. This is the default setting for the PIX Firewall and 
cannot be changed. Because 100 is the most trusted interface security level, 
your corporate network should be set up behind it. This is so no one else can 
access it unless they are specifically given permission, and every device 
behind this interface can have access outside of the corporate network.
I
Security level 0—This is the lowest security level for the outside interface of 
the PIX Firewall. This is the default setting for the PIX Firewall and cannot 
be changed. Because 0 is the least trusted interface security level, you should 
set your most untrusted network behind this interface so that it does not have 
access to other interfaces unless it is specifically given permission. This 
interface is usually used for your Internet connection.
I
Security levels 1−99—These are the security levels that you can assign to the 
perimeter interfaces connected to the PIX Firewall. You assign the security 
levels based on the type of access you want each device to have.

The following are examples of different interface connections between the PIX 
Firewall and other perimeter devices:
I
More secure interface (the higher security level) to a less secure interface 
(the lower security level)—Traffic originating from the inside interface of the 
PIX Firewall with a security level of 100 to the outside interface of the PIX 
Firewall with a security level of 0 follows this rule: allow all IP-based traffic 
unless restricted by access lists, authentication, or authorization.
I
Less secure interface (lower security level) to a more secure interface (higher 
security level)—Traffic originating from the outside interface of the PIX 
Firewall with a security level of 0 to the inside interface of the PIX Firewall 
with a security level of 100 follows this rule: drop all packets unless 
specifically allowed by the conduit command. Further restrict the traffic if 
authentication and authorization is used.
I
Same secure interface to a same secure interface—No traffic flows between 
two interfaces with the same security level. 
The following table explains the diagram in the previous figure.

The PIX Firewall can have up to four perimeter networks for a total of six 
interfaces.

PIX Firewall Primary
Commands
PIX Firewall Primary
Commands
The following are the basic configuration
commands for the PIX Firewall:
• nameif
• interface
• ip address
• route
The basic PIX Firewall commands are as follows:
I
nameif—Assigns a name to each interface and specifies a security level for 
each interface.
I
interface—Configures the type and capability of each perimeter interface.
I
ip address—Assigns an IP address to each interface.
I
route—Defines a static or default route for an interface.
Note
Inside and outside interface names can be changed, but this is not recommended. 
These terms are used so universally, that it would be confusing to others.

nameif Command
nameif Command
• Assigns a name to each perimeter interface on the PIX
Firewall and specifies its security level
The nameif command assigns a name to each perimeter interface on the PIX 
Firewall and specifies its security level (except for the inside and outside PIX 
Firewall interfaces, which are named by default). The syntax for the nameif
command is as follows:
nameif hardware_id if_name security_level
Argument
Description
hardware_id
Specifies a perimeter interface and its slot 
location on the PIX Firewall.
You can enter three interfaces here: Ethernet, 
FDDI, or Token Ring. Each interface is 
represented by an alphanumeric identifier 
based on which interface it is and what 
numeric identifier you choose to give it. For
example, an Ethernet interface is represented 
as e1, e2, e3, and so on; a FDDI interface is 
represented as fddi1, fddi2, fddi3, and so on; 
and a Token Ring interface is represented as 
token-ring1, token-ring2, and token-ring3, and 
so on.
if_name
Describes the perimeter interface. This name 
is assigned by you, and must be used in all 
future configuration references to the 
perimeter interface.
security_level
Indicates the security level for the perimeter 
interface. Enter a security level of 1−99.

interface Command
• Configures the type and capability of each
perimeter interface
pixfirewall(config)# interface ethernet0 100full
pixfirewall(config)# interface token-ring0 16mbps
pixfirewall(config)# interface fddi1 auto
The interface command identifies interfaces, sets the interface speed, and enables 
the interface to function.
The syntax for the interface command is as follows:
interface hardware_id hardware_speed
Argument
Description
hardware_id
Specifies an interface and its slot location on 
the PIX Firewall. This is the same variable 
used with the nameif command.
hardware_speed
Determines the connection speed. Enter auto
so the PIX Firewall will sense the speed 
needed for the device.
Note
When a FDDI or Token Ring interface card is installed using the interface
command, you must define the FDDI or Token Ring interface card because the PIX 
Firewall does not automatically recognize them.

address. Use 0.0.0.0 to specify a default 
route. The 0.0.0.0 IP address can be 
abbreviated as 0.
netmask
Specifies a network mask to apply to 
ip_address. Use 0.0.0.0 to specify a default 
route. The 0.0.0.0 netmask can be 
abbreviated as 0.
gateway_ip
Specifies the IP address of the gateway router 
(the next hop address for this route).
metric
Specifies the number of hops to gateway_ip. 
If you are not sure, enter 1. Your WAN 
administrator can supply this information or 
you can use a traceroute command to obtain 
the number of hops. The default is 1 if a metric 
is not specified.
All routes entered using the route command are stored in the configuration when 
it is saved. In the example shown in the figure, all outgoing packets are sent to the 
192.168.1.1 router IP address. More than one route can be configured.

Network Address Translation
and Global
Network Address Translation
and Global
• Network Address Translation (NAT) allows an
organization with IP addresses that are not globally
unique to connect to the Internet by translating
those addresses into globally routable IP address
space.
• Global is a select pool of registered or public
addresses that are used by the internal host for
connectivity to the outside network through the PIX
Firewall.
• NAT works with global to hide the real network
identity of internal systems from the outside
network.
The nat command lets you enable or disable address translation for one or more 
internal addresses. Address translation means that when a host starts an outbound 
connection, the IP addresses in the internal network are translated into global 
addresses. Address translation lets your network have any IP addressing scheme. 
The PIX Firewall protects these addresses from visibility on the external network. 
You can have up to 1,000 Network Address Translation (NAT) groups. 
I
NAT allows an organization with IP addresses that are not globally unique to

pixfirewall(config)#
nat Command
nat Command
• Shields IP addresses on the inside network from the
outside network
pixfirewall(config)# nat (inside) 1
0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0
NAT enables you to keep your internal IP addresses—those behind the PIX 
Firewall—unknown to external networks. NAT accomplishes this by translating 
the internal IP addresses, which are not globally unique, into globally accepted IP 
addresses before packets are forwarded to the external network.
The syntax for the nat command is as follows:
nat [(if_name)] nat_id local_ip [netmask ]
Argument
Description
if_name
Describes the external network interface name 
where you will use the global addresses.
nat_id
Identifies the global pool and matches it with 
its respective nat command.
local_ip
The IP address that is assigned to the 
interface on the inside network.
netmask
Network mask for the local IP address. You 
can use 0.0.0.0 to allow all outbound 
connections to translate with IP addresses 
from the global pool.
When you initially configure the PIX Firewall, you can enable all inside hosts to 
access outbound connections with the nat 1 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 command. The nat 1 
0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 command enables NAT and lets all inside hosts (specified as 
0.0.0.0) to access outbound connections. The nat command can specify single 
hosts or ranges of hosts to make access more selective. You can use 0 in place of 
0.0.0.0.

When an outbound IP packet that is sent from a device on the inside network 
reaches the PIX Firewall, the source address is extracted and compared to an 
internal table of existing translations. If the device’s address is not already in the 
table, it is translated and a new entry is created for that device and it is assigned a 
global IP address from a pool of global IP addresses. The table is then updated 
and the translated IP packet is forwarded. After the session terminates or there 
have been no translated packets for that particular IP address, the entry is removed 
from the table, and the global address is freed for use by another inside device.

pixfirewall(config)#
global Command
global Command
• The global command works together with the nat command to
assign a registered or public IP address to an internal host when
accessing the outside network through the firewall.
pixfirewall(config)# nat (inside) 1 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0
pixfirewall(config)# global (outside) 1 192.168.1.10-
192.168.1.254
The global command defines a pool of global addresses. The global addresses in 
the pool provide an IP address for each outbound connection and for those 
inbound connections resulting from outbound connections. Ensure that associated 
nat and global command statements have the same nat_id.
The syntax for the global command is as follows:
global [(if_name)] nat_id global_ip [-global_ip] [netmask global_mask]
Argument
Description
if_name
Describes the external network interface name 
where you will use the global addresses.
nat_id
Identifies the global pool and matches it with 
its respective nat command.
global_ip
Single IP addresses or the beginning IP 
address for a range of global IP addresses.
global_ip
A range of global IP addresses.
netmask global_mask
The network mask for the global IP. If 
subnetting is in effect, use the subnet mask; 
for example, 255.255.255.128. If you specify 
an address range that overlaps subnets with 
the netmask command, this command will not 
use the broadcast or network address in the 
pool of global addresses. For example, if you 
use 255.255.255.128 and an address range of 
192.150.50.20−192.150.50.140, the 
192.150.50.127 broadcast address and the 
192.150.50.128 network address will not be 
included in the pool of global addresses.
If the nat command is used, the companion command, global, must be configured 
to define the pool of translated IP addresses.

To delete a global entry, use the no global command. For example, no global 
(outside) 1 192.168.1.10–192.168.1.254 netmask 255.255.0.0. 
Note 
The PIX Firewall assigns addresses from the global pool starting from the low end 
to the high end of the range specified in the global command. 
 
Note 
The PIX Firewall uses the global addresses to assign a virtual IP address to an 
internal NAT address. After adding, changing, or removing a global statement, use 
the clear xlate command to make the IP addresses available in the translation 
table.

static and conduit Commands
static and conduit Commands
• static and conduit commands allow
connections from a lower security
interface to a higher security
interface.
• static is used to create a
permanent mapping between an
inside IP address and a global
IP address.
• conduit is an exception in
the ASA inbound security
policy for a given host.
 
Although most connections occur from an interface with a high security level to 
an interface with a low security level, there are times when you will want to allow 
connections from an interface with a lower security level to an interface with a 
higher security level. To do this, use the static and conduit commands. 
The static command creates static mapping between an inside IP address and a 
global IP address. Using the static command enables you to set a permanent 
global IP address for a particular inside IP address. This creates an entrance for 
the specified interfaces with the lower security level into the specified interface 
with a higher security level. 
After creating a static mapping between an inside IP address and a global IP 
address by using the static command, the connection from the outside interface to 
the inside interface is still blocked by the PIX Firewall’s ASA. The conduit 
command allows traffic to flow between interfaces and creates the exceptions to 
the PIX Firewall’s ASA. 
Note 
When you use a static command, you must also use a conduit command. The 
static command makes the mapping, and the conduit command lets users access 
the static mapping.

• Permanently maps a single IP address
• Recommended for internal service hosts
 
The static command creates a permanent mapping (called a static translation slot 
or “xlate”) between a local IP address and a global IP address. For outbound 
connections, use static to specify an address in the pool of global addresses that is 
always used for translation between the local host and the global address. For 
inbound connections, use static with the conduit command to identify addresses 
visible on the external network.  
The static command creates a permanent mapping (static translation slot) between 
a local IP address and a NIC-registered IP address. The syntax for the static 
command is as follows: 
static [(internal_if_name, external_if_name)] global_ip local_ip 
Argument 
Description 
internal_if_name 
The internal network interface name.  
external_if_name 
The external network interface name.  
global_ip 
A global IP address for the outside interface. This address cannot 
be a PAT IP address. 
local_ip  
The local IP address from the inside network.  
netmask 
Reserve word required before specifying the network mask. 
 
The security level for each interface is set by the nameif command. The static 
command allows traffic to originate from an interface with a lower security value, 
through the PIX Firewall, to an interface with a higher security value. For 
example, a static and conduit must be configured to allow incoming sessions from 
the outside interface to the DMZ interface, or from the outside interface to the 
inside interface. 
Statics take precedence over nat and global command pairs. Use the show static 
command to view static statements in the configuration. 
In the previous figure, when a packet from the client station 10.0.1.3 goes out 
through the PIX Firewall, it will have the source IP address of 192.168.1.10.

pixfirewall(config) #
 
The conduit command permits or denies connections from outside the PIX 
Firewall to access TCP or UDP services on hosts inside the network. The conduit 
statement creates an exception to the PIX Firewall ASA by permitting 
connections from one PIX Firewall network interface to access hosts on another. 
To allow connections from a lower security interface to a higher security 
interface, you must use the conduit command. The conduit command is what 
actually creates an exception to the standard PIX Firewall ASA.  
The syntax for the conduit command is as follows: 
conduit permit | deny protocol global_ip global_mask [operator port [port]] foreign_ip 
foreign_mask [operator port [port]] 
 
Argument 
Description 
permit 
Permits access if the conditions are met. 
deny 
Denies access if the conditions are met. 
protocol 
Specifies the transport protocol for the connection. Possible literal 
values are eigrp, gre, icmp, igmp, grp, ip, ipinip, nos, ospf, tcp, 
udp, or an integer in the range 0 to 255 representing an IP protocol 
number. Use ip to specify all transport protocols. You can view valid 
protocol numbers online at:  
http://www.isi.edu/in-notes/iana/assignments/protocol-numbers 
icmp 
Permits or denies ICMP access to one or more global IP addresses. 
Specify the ICMP type in the icmp_type variable, or omit it to 
specify all ICMP types. 
global_ip 
A global IP address previously defined by a global or static 
command. You can use any if the global_ip and global_mask are 
0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0. The any option applies the permit or deny to the 
global addresses on all interfaces.  
If global_ip is a host, you can omit global_mask by specifying the 
host command before global_ip.

Argument 
Description 
operator 
A comparison operand that lets you specify a port or a port range. 
Possible values are eq, t, any, gt, neq, and range. Use the no 
operator and port to indicate all ports. 
global_mask 
Network mask of global_ip. The global_mask is a 32-bit, 4-part 
dotted decimal; such as, 255.255.255.255. Use zeros to indicate bit 
positions to be ignored. Use subnetting if required.  
If you use 0 for global_ip, use 0 for the global_mask; otherwise, 
enter the global_mask appropriate to global_ip. 
port 
Services you permit to be used while accessing global_ip. Specify 
services by the port that handles it, such as 25 for SMTP, 80 for 
HTTP, and so on. 0 means any port. The port values are defined in 
RFC 1700. Permitted literal names are dns, esp, ftp, h323, http, 
ident, nntp, ntp, pop2, pop3, pptp, rpc, smtp, snmp, snmptrap, 
sqlnet, tcp, telnet, tftp, and udp. Note that you can specify literals 
in port ranges, for example, ftp-h323. You can also specify 
numbers. 
foreign_ip 
An external IP address (host or network) that can access the 
global_ip. You can specify 0.0.0.0 or 0 for any host. If both the 
foreign_ip and foreign_mask are 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0, you can use the 
shorthand any command, which applies to all interfaces.  
If foreign_ip is a host, you can omit foreign_mask by specifying 
the host command before foreign_ip. 
foreign_mask 
Network mask of foreign_ip. The foreign_mask is a 32-bit, 4-part 
dotted decimal, such as 255.255.255.255. Use zeros in a part to 
indicate bit positions to be ignored. Use subnetting if required. 
If you use 0 for foreign_ip, use 0 for the foreign_mask; otherwise, 
enter the foreign_mask appropriate to foreign_ip. 
operator 
A comparison operand that lets you specify a port or a port range. 
Possible values are eq, lt, any, gt, neq, range. Use the no operator 
and port to indicate all ports. 
port 
Services you permit to be used while accessing global_ip or 
foreign_ip. Specify services by the port that handles it, such as 25 
for SMTP, 80 for HTTP, and so on. You can specify ports by either 
a literal name or as a number in the range of 0 to 65535. You can 
specify all ports by not specifying a port value (for example, 
conduit deny tcp any any). 
This command is the default condition for the conduit command in 
that all ports are denied until explicitly permitted.  
You can view valid port numbers online at: 
http://www.isi.edu/in-notes/iana/assignments/port-numbers 
 
The example in the previous figure allows FTP services via IP address 
192.168.1.10 to the inside host 10.0.1.3 from the outside. The global_ip and 
global_mask arguments define the IP address or addresses where connections are 
being permitted. 
You can have up to 8000 conduits, and can remove a conduit with the no conduit 
command.

Note 
If you want internal users to be able to ping external hosts, you must create an 
Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) conduit for echo reply; for example, to 
give ping access to all hosts, use the conduit permit icmp any any command. 
However, this may cause a lot of traffic on busy networks.

PAT Global
 
Port Address Translation (PAT) is a combination of an IP address and a source 
port number, which creates a unique session. PAT uses the same IP address for all 
packets, but a different unique source port greater than 1024. 
PAT provides the following advantages: 
I 
PAT and NAT can be used together. 
I 
The PAT address is different than the outside interface address. 
I 
PAT provides for IP address expansion. 
I 
One outside IP address is used for up to 63,000 inside hosts. 
I 
PAT maps port numbers to a single IP address. 
I 
PAT hides the inside source address by using a single IP address from the 
PIX Firewall. 
In the figure above, two clients are requesting connectivity to the Internet. The 
PIX Firewall checks security rules to verify the security levels, and then replaces 
the source IP address with the PAT IP address. To maintain accountability, the 
source port address is changed to a unique number greater than 1024.

The PIX Firewall PAT feature expands an address pool: 
I 
One outside IP address is used for approximately 4,000 inside hosts (the 
practical limit is 4,000, and the theoretical limit is greater than 64,000) 
I 
Maps TCP port numbers to a single IP address 
I 
Hides the inside source address by using single IP address from the PIX 
Firewall 
I 
PAT can be used with NAT 
I 
A PAT address is a virtual address, different from the outside address 
Note 
Do not use PAT when running multimedia applications through the PIX Firewall. 
Multimedia applications need access to specific ports and can conflict with port 
mappings provided by PAT. 
In the example of PAT in the preceding figure, XYZ Company has only four 
registered IP addresses. One address is taken by the perimeter router, the PIX 
Firewall, and bastion host. 
The example configuration is as follows: 
ip address (inside) 10.0.0.1 255.255.255.0 
ip address (outside) 192.168.0.2 255.255.255.0 
route (outside) 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 192.168.0.1 
IP addresses are assigned to the internal and external interfaces. A single 
registered IP address is put into the global pool, and is shared by all outgoing 
access for network 10.0.0.0: 
global (outside) 1 192.168.0.9 netmask 255.255.255.0

Another feature to control outbound connections is the ability to control which 
internal IP addresses are visible on the outside. The nat 0 command lets you 
disable address translation so that inside IP addresses are visible on the outside 
without address translation. Use this feature when you have Network Information 
Center- (NIC) registered IP addresses on your inside network that you want to be 
accessible on the outside network. Use of nat 0 depends on your security policy. 
If your policy allows for internal clients to have their IP address exposed to the 
Internet, then nat 0 is the process to provide that service. 
In the figure above, the address 192.168.1.9 is not translated. When you enter nat 
(inside) 0 192.168.1.9 255.255.255.255, the PIX Firewall displays the following 
message: nat 0 192.168.1.9.

The PIX Firewall supports up to four additional perimeter interfaces for platform 
extensibility and security policy enforcement on publicly accessible services. The 
multiple perimeter interfaces enable the PIX Firewall to protect publicly 
accessible Internet, mail, and Domain Name System (DNS servers on the DMZ. 
Web-based and traditional electronic data interchange (EDI) applications that link 
vendors and customers are also more secure and scalable when implemented 
using a physically separate network. As the trend toward building these extranet 
or partnernet applications accelerates, the PIX Firewall is already prepared to 
accommodate them.

A third interface is configured as shown in the figure above. When your PIX 
Firewall is equipped with three or more interfaces, use the following guidelines to 
configure it while employing NAT: 
I 
The outside interface cannot be renamed or given a different security level. 
I 
An interface is always “outside” with respect to another interface that has a 
higher security level. Packets cannot flow between interfaces that have the 
same security level. 
I 
Use a single default route statement to the outside interface only. Set the 
default route with the route command. 
I 
Use the nat command to let users on the respective interfaces start outbound 
connections. Associate the nat_id with the global_id in the global command 
statement. The valid ID numbers can be any positive number up to two 
billion. 
I 
After you have completed a configuration in which you add, change, or 
remove a global statement, save the configuration, and enter the clear xlate 
command so that the IP addresses will be updated in the translation table. 
I 
To permit access to servers on protected networks, use the static and conduit 
commands.

In the figure above, the PIX Firewall has four interfaces. Users on all interfaces 
have access to all servers and hosts (inside, outside, DMZ, and partnernet). 
Configuring four interfaces requires more attention to detail, but they are still 
configured with standard PIX Firewall commands. Enable users on an interface 
with a higher security level to access hosts on an interface with a lower security 
level by using the nat and global commands. For example, enable the inside 
interface to access the web server on the DMZ interface. 
To let users on an interface with a lower security level (users on the partnernet 
interfaces access the DMZ) to access hosts on an interface with a higher security 
level, use the static and conduit commands. As seen in the figure above, the 
partnernet has a security level of 40 and the DMZ has a security level of 50. The 
DMZ will use nat and global commands to speak with the partnernet, and will 
use statics and conduits to receive traffic from the partnernet.

connections through the PIX Firewall: 
1. Open a web browser on the Windows NT server. 

2-34 
Cisco Secure PIX Firewall Advanced 1.01 
Copyright  2000, Cisco Systems, Inc. 
2. Use the web browser to access the IP address perimeter router backbone 
server and open the server’s HTTP server: http://172.30.1.50. Stop the 
connection and then initiate a new connection. 
Step 3 
Observe the translation table with the show xlate command: 
pixfirewall(config)# show xlate 
Your display should appear similar to the following: 
Global 192.168.P.X Local 10.0.P.3 nconns 1 econns 0 flags - 
Note how the global addresses have incremented and are chosen from the low end 
of the global range. 
Task 6: Configure a Static and Conduit from the PIX 
Firewall Outside Interface to the Windows NT Server Inside 
the Network 
Configure a static translation so that traffic originated from the internal Windows 
NT server always has the same source address on the outside interface of the PIX 
Firewall. Test the static and conduit by pinging the Windows NT server from the 
perimeter router. In a production environment, you should remove the conduit 
permit icmp any any command to prevent a potential security breach. Use the 
following commands: 
Step 1 
Clear the translation table: 
pixfirewall(config)# clear xlate 
Step 2 
Create a static translation from the outside PIX Firewall interface to the internal 
host 
pixfirewall(config)# static (inside,outside) 192.168.P.10 10.0.P.3 
pixfirewall(config)# conduit permit tcp host 192.168.P.10 eq www any 
(where P = pod number) 
Step 3 
Turn on ICMP monitoring at the PIX Firewall: 
pixfirewall(config)# debug icmp trace  
ICMP trace on Warning: this may cause problems on busy networks 
Step 4 
Ping the perimeter router from your Windows NT server to test the translation. 
Observe the source and destination of the packets at the console of the R1 
perimeter router from each of the following locations 
C:\> ping 192.168.P.1 
(where P = pod number) 
Note the example display for pixfirewall: 
Outbound ICMP echo request 10.0.P.3 > 192.168.P.10 > 192.168.P.1

(where P = pod number) 
Observe the source, destination, and translated addresses on the PIX Firewall 
console. 
Step 5 
Use the web browser to access the IP address of the peer’s host by entering 
http://192.168.Q.10 (where Q = peer pod number) in your web browser.. 
Step 6 
Ping a peer inside host from your inside host as allowed by the conduit via the 
static. 
C:\> ping 192.168.Q.10 
(where Q  = peer pod number) 
Step 7 
Turn off ICMP monitoring at the PIX Firewall. 
pixfirewall(config)# no debug icmp trace 
Task 7: Configure Inside Multiple Interfaces 
Configure the PIX Firewall to allow access to the DMZ from the inside and 
outside network. Complete the following steps to configure the global address 
pools, NAT, and routing for the DMZ interface: 
Step 1 
Assign one pool of IP addresses for hosts on the public DMZ: 
pixfirewall(config)# global (dmz) 1 172.16.P.10-172.16.P.254 netmask 255.255.255.0 
(where P = pod number) 
Step 2 
Name the bastion host using the name command. The name configured here will 
be used in a later lab step: 
pixfirewall(config)# name 172.16.P.2 bastionhost 
pixfirewall(config)# show name 
name 172.16.P.2 bastionhost 
(where P = pod number) 
Step 3 
Clear the translation table so that the global IP address will be updated in the 
table: 
pixfirewall(config)# clear xlate 
Step 4 
Write the current configuration to Flash memory: 
pixfirewall(config)# write memory 
Step 5 
Test connectivity to the bastion host from your internal host. 
C:\> ping 172.16.P.2 
(where P = pod number) 
Step 6 
Test web access to your bastion host from the Windows NT server by doing the 
following: 
1. Open a web browser on the Windows NT server. 
2. Use the web browser to access the IP address of your bastion host: 
http://172.16.P.2.. The home page of the bastion host should appear on your 
web browser. (where P =pod number) 

2-36

3. Use the show arp, show conn, and show xlate commands to observe the 
transaction: 
pixfirewall(config)# show arp 
        outside 192.168.P.1 00e0.1e41.8762 
        inside 10.0.P.3 00e0.b05a.d509 
        dmz bastionhost 00e0.1eb1.78df 
pixfirewall(config)# show xlate 
Global 172.16.P.2 Local 10.0.P.10 static nconns 0 econns 0 flags s 
Global 192.168.P.3 Local 10.0.P.10 nconns 0 econns 0 flags - 
pixfirewall(config)# show conn 
0 in use, 3 most used 
Step 7 
Test FTP access to the bastion host from your Windows NT server by doing the 
following: 
1. Establish an FTP session to the bastion host: Start>Run>ftp 172.16.P.2. You 
have reached the bastion host if you receive the message “Connected to 
172.16.P.2”(where P = pod number). 
2. Quit the FTP session if you were able to connect, and log in: ftp> quit. 
Task 8: Configure Outside Access to the DMZ 
Configure the PIX Firewall to permit outside access to hosts in the DMZ. 
Configure a static and conduit to test communications using ping between 
perimeter routers and the bastion host. Then configure HTTP and FTP access. 
Complete the following steps: 
Step 1 
Create a static translation from the outside interface to the bastion host on the 
DMZ interface: 
pixfirewall(config)# static (dmz,outside) 192.168.P.11 bastionhost 
(where P = pod number) 
Step 2 
Configure a conduit to allow pings from perimeter routers to the static assigned to 
the DMZ bastion host: 
pixfirewall(config)# conduit permit icmp host 192.168.P.11 any 
(where P = pod number) 
Step 3 
Ping a peer bastion host from your internal host as allowed by the conduit via the 
static 
C:\> ping 192.168.Q.11  
(where Q = peer pod number) 
Step 4 
View current static translations: 
pixfirewall(config)# show xlate 
Global 192.168.P.11 Local 10.0.P.3 static nconns1 econns1 
Global 192.168.P.11 Local bastionhost static nconns0 econns0 

Copyright  2000, Cisco Systems, Inc. 
Cisco Secure PIX Firewall Configuration 
2-37 
Step 5 
Configure conduits to allow web and FTP access to the bastion host from the 
outside and then test the conduits. Configure the conduits to allow TCP traffic 
from clients on the outside network to access the DMZ bastion host using the 
previously configured static: 
pixfirewall(config)# conduit permit tcp host 192.168.P.11 eq www  any 
pixfirewall(config)# conduit permit tcp host 192.168.P.11 eq ftp  any 
(where P = pod number) 
Step 6 
Display the conduits that you have just configured: 
pixfirewall(config)# show conduit 
conduit permit tcp host 192.168.1.11 eq www any (hitcnt=0) 
conduit permit tcp host 192.168.1.11 eq ftp any (hitcnt=0) 
Step 7 
Test web access to the bastion hosts of opposite pod groups by doing the 
following: 
1. Open a web browser on the client PC. 
2. 
Identify another pod group that is ready for a test. 
3. Use the web browser to access the IP address of the static mapped to the 
bastion host of the opposite pod group: http://192.168.Q.11 
4. 
Have an opposite pod group test your static and conduit configuration. 
5. Use the show arp, show conn, and show xlate commands to observe the 
transaction. 
Step 8 
Test FTP access to the bastion hosts of other pod groups by doing the following: 
1. Identify another pod group that is ready for a test. 
2. On your client PC, use FTP to get into the bastion host of another pod group. 
Start>Run>ftp 192.168.Q.11 
(where Q = peer pod number) 
3. Have an opposite pod group use FTP to get into your bastion host to test your 
static and conduit configuration. 
4. Use the show arp, show conn, and show xlate commands to observe the 
transaction. 
Step 9 
Write the current configuration to the terminal and verify that you have entered 
the previous commands correctly. Your configuration should appear similar to the 
following: 
pixfirewall(config)# write terminal

Access Control Through the PIX Firewall
This section discusses access control through the PIX Firewall using an access 
control list (ACL).
© 2000, Cisco Systems, Inc. 
www.cisco.com
CSPFA 1.01—3-4
Access Control List
Access Control List
• An access control list (ACL) enables you to
determine which systems can establish
connections through your router or PIX
Firewall.
–Create an ACL with the access-list and
access-group commands.
–The access-list and access-group commands
are an alternative for the conduit and
outbound commands.
An ACL is a list kept by routers and the PIX Firewall to control access to and 
from the router or firewall (for example, to prevent packets with a certain IP 
address from leaving a particular interface). An ACL is implemented using two 
commands: the access-list command and the access-group command.
Use the access-list command to create an ACL. The access-group command 
binds the ACL to a specific interface on the router or PIX Firewall. Only one 
ACL can be bound to an interface using the access-group command.
The access-list and access-group commands are an alternative to the outbound
command statement. The access-list and access-group commands also take 
precedence over the outbound command statement.
Note
Cisco recommends using the access-list and access-group commands for ACLs 
instead of the outbound command because the outbound command is a PIX 
Firewall-specific command and Cisco is moving toward commands that are based 
on the Cisco IOS.

• Binds an access control list to an interface
The access-list command uses the same syntax as the Cisco IOS software access-
list command except that the subnet mask in the PIX Firewall access-list 
command is reversed from the Cisco IOS software version of this command. For 
example, a subnet mask specified as 0.0.0.255 in the Cisco IOS access-list 
command would be specified as 255.0.0.0 in the PIX Firewall access-list
command. The syntax for the access-list command is as follows:
access-list acl_name [deny | permit] protocol src_addr src_mask operator port dest_addr
Argument
Description
acl_name
Name of an ACL.
deny
Does not allow a packet to travel 
through the PIX Firewall. By default, the 
PIX Firewall denies all inbound packets 
unless you specifically permit access.
permit
Selects a packet to travel through the 
PIX Firewall. 
protocol
Name or number of an IP protocol.
src_addr
Address of the network or host from 
which the packet is being sent.

protocol
Limit outbound access to udp, tcp, or 
icmp protocols.
The use of an outbound command requires use of the apply command. The 
apply command lets you specify whether the ACL applies to inside users’ ability 
to start outbound connections with the apply command outgoing_src option, or 
whether the ACL applies to the inside users’ ability to access servers on the 
outside network with the apply commans outgoing_dest option. The syntax for 
the apply command is as follows:
apply [[(if_name)] list_ID outgoing_src | outgoing_dest]
Argument
Description
if_name
The network interface originating the 
connection.
list_ID
A tag number for the ACL.
outgoing_src
Denies or permits an internal IP 
address to start outbound connections 
using the services specified in the 
outbound command.
outgoing_dest

Java Applet Filtering
Java Applet Filtering
• Java applet filtering allows an administrator to
prevent the downloading of Java applets by an
inside system.
• Java programs can provide a vehicle through
which an inside system can be invaded.
• Java applets are executable programs that are
banned within some security policies.
The PIX Firewall supports a Java applet filter that can stop potentially dangerous 
Java applications on a per-client or per-IP address basis. The outbound command 
with the java keyword is used to enable filtering of Java applets.
Two problems with this is that some Java applets may be downloaded when you 
permit access to port 80 (HTTP), and some Java applets can contain hidden code 
that can destroy data on the internal network. A solution to these problems is to 
use the outbound command to block all Java applets.

Java Applet Filtering
Commands
Java Applet Filtering
Commands
filter java port[-port] local_ip  mask
foreign_ip mask
pixfirewall(config)#
• The filter java command filters out Java applets that
return to the PIX Firewall from an outbound
connection.
• Some Java applets can contain malicious code that
can manipulate data on the internal network.
• Use the outbound and apply commands to block
Java applets.
Java filtering lets an administrator prevent Java applets from being downloaded 
by an inside system. Java applets are executable programs that are banned by 
many site security policies. The syntax for the filter java command is as follows:
filter java port[-port] local_ip mask foreign_ip mask
Argument
Description
port[-port]
One or more ports on which Java 
applets may be received.
local_ip
The IP address interface with the 
highest security level from which 
access is sought.
mask
Wildcard mask.
foreign_ip
The IP address of the interface with the 
lowest security level to which access is 
sought.
Java programs can provide a vehicle through which an inside system can be 
invaded or compromised. When Java filtering is enabled, the PIX Firewall 
searches for the programmed “cafe babe” string and, if found, drops the Java 
applet. A sample Java class code snippet looks like the following:
00000000: café babe 003 002d 0099 0900 8345 0098

ActiveX Blocking
ActiveX Blocking
• ActiveX controls are applets that can be
inserted in Web pages or other applications.
• ActiveX controls can provide a way for
someone to attack servers.
• The PIX Firewall can be used to block ActiveX
controls.
 
ActiveX controls, formerly known as Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) or 
Object Linking and Embedding control (OCX), are applets that can be inserted in 
web pages—often used in animations—or in other applications. ActiveX controls 
create a potential security problem because they can provide a way for someone to 
attack servers. Because of this potential security problem, you can use the PIX 
Firewall to block all ActiveX controls.

URL Filtering with WebSENSE 
This section discusses how to perform URL filtering using WebSENSE. 
© 2000, Cisco Systems, Inc.

CSPFA 1.0—3-16
WebSENSE
WebSENSE
• WebSENSE is used for any organization that
needs to provide Internet access, but is
concerned with access to unauthorized sites.
• WebSENSE allows you to control or monitor
Internet activity.
• With WebSENSE, organizations can guard
against user downtime caused by employees
surfing sites that are not work-related and
misusing network resources.
• WebSENSE works on Windows NT and Solaris.
 
WebSENSE is software that provides integrated, URL filtering for the PIX 
Firewall, giving network administrators the ability to effectively monitor and 
control network traffic. WebSENSE is used to block specific URLs because the 
PIX Firewall cannot. WebSENSE determines whether to block or permit specific 
URLs based on its configuration and the Master Database. The WebSENSE 
configuration is the filtering rules you set in WebSENSE. The Master Database is 
a database of URLs to block. This database is maintained and updated daily by the 
WebSENSE corporate office. You can choose when, and if you want, to 
download the URLs from this database. 
WebSENSE is useful because between the hours of 9 a.m. and 5 p.m.:  
I 
30 to 40 percent of Internet surfing is not business related. 
I 
70 percent of all Internet porn traffic occurs. 
I 
More than 60 percent of online purchases are made. 
The following are characteristics of WebSENSE: 
I 
Hosted on Windows NT or Solaris platform 
I 
Located inside or on the perimeter network 
I 
Highly scalable architecture 
I 
Outbound database and lookup processing minimizes impact on firewall 
performance and security 
I 
Multiple servers can be used to increase capacity 
I 
Has 30 categories of filters

When the PIX Firewall receives a request to access a URL from users, it queries 
WebSENSE to determine whether or not to return the requested URL. 
WebSENSE checks its configurations and the Master Database to determine 
whether the URL should be blocked. If the URL should be blocked, WebSENSE 
displays either the standard blocking message or directs the user requesting the 
URL to a specified web site.

• In this example, the WebSENSE host is on the inside
interface at IP address 10.0.0.3.  A time value of 10 seconds
is specified as the maximum allowed idle time before the
PIX Firewall switches to the next WebSENSE server.
 
Before you can begin URL filtering by configuring WebSENSE or downloading 
the Master Database for WebSENSE, you must designate the server on which 
WebSENSE will be running. Use the url-server command to designate the server 
that WebSENSE runs on, then enable the URL filtering service with the filter url 
command.  
The syntax for the url-server command is as follows: 
url-server [(if_name)] host ip_address [timeout seconds] 
Argument 
Description 
if_name 
The network interface where the 
authentication server resides. If not 
specified, the default is inside. 
host ip_address 
The server that runs the WebSENSE 
URL filtering application.

The maximum idle time permitted 
before the PIX Firewall switches to the 
next server you specified. The default is 
5 seconds.

• Prevents outbound users from accessing World Wide Web
URLs that are designated with the WebSENSE filtering
application
pixfirewall(config)# filter url http 0 0 0 0

• Use the filter url command to tell the PIX Firewall how to
filter requests
 
After designating which server uses WebSENSE, use the filter url command to 
tell the PIX Firewall to send URL requests to WebSENSE for filtering.  
The example command in the figure above instructs the PIX Firewall to send all 
URL requests to the WebSENSE server to be filtered. The allow option in the 
filter command is crucial to the use of the PIX Firewall URL filtering feature. If 
you use the allow option and the WebSENSE server goes offline, the PIX 
Firewall lets all URL requests continue without filtering. If the allow option is not 
specified, all port 80 URL requests are stopped until the server is back online.  
The syntax for the filter url command is as follows: 
filter url http | except local_ip local_mask foreign_ip foreign_mask [allow] 
Argument 
Description 
url 
Filter URLs from data moving through 
the PIX Firewall. 
http

After you choose whether you want to create a new preference set or edit an 
existing preference set by clicking either New or Edit from the Preference Set 
frame in the Screening tab, the Preference Set window opens. From this window 
you define your new preference set or edit your existing preference set. 
Specifically, you can choose what protocols and categories to block by selecting 
or deselecting the checkboxes within both the Protocols and Categories frames. 
If you choose to edit the Default Period preference set, initially all protocols and 
categories are blocked (all checkboxes are selected). You can modify the 
protocols and categories that the Default Period blocks, but you cannot set its 
active period.

Set Preference Set Times
Set Preference Set Times
 
After you have defined a preference set, you can create one or more screening 
periods for it. Each screening period identifies the time of day and days of the 
week that the preference set is active. Choose the days and times when the 
preference set will be active from the Screening Period frame in the Screening 
tab. When a preference set is active, WebSENSE blocks the categories and 
protocols that have been selected in the Preference Set window. 
Note 
Remember that the screening dates and times displayed in the Screening Period 
frame are never applicable to the Default Period, which is automatically active 
when no other preference set is active.

Custom URLs Tab
Custom URLs Tab
 
When using the Master Database—the list of URLs that should be blocked as 
determined and updated daily by the WebSENSE corporate office—you may need 
to permit one of the blocked URLs. If you need to permit URLs that are normally 
blocked by the parameters of the Master Database, you can add the URLs to a 
special “permit list.” URLs in this list will never be blocked by WebSENSE. 
When accessing a URL that has been added to the permit list, WebSENSE logs 
the access as normal. 
To add a URL to the permit list, click Permit in the Custom URLs tab. Choose 
which protocol to use from the drop-down list next to Permit, then enter the URL 
in the field that follows. Click the Add button. The URL then appears in the 
URLs window with the designation “Permit.” 
Sometimes certain URLs are not blocked by either the WebSENSE configuration 
or the Master Database. If you need a specific URL blocked, add the URL to a 
special “screen list.” After these URLs have been added, when users attempt to 
access the URLs specified on the screen list, they will  be blocked and the event 
logged by WebSENSE.  
To screen a URL, click Screen in the Custom URLs tab. Choose the category 
under which to track the site from the drop-down list next to Screen. (There is a 
special category called User Defined, which can be used as a general purpose 
category to hold miscellaneous URLs.) Choose which protocol to use from the 
drop-down list next to Permit, then enter the URL in the field that follows. Click 
the Add button. The URL then appears in the URLs window with the designation 
“Screen.”

Workstations Tab
Workstations Tab
 
The Workstations tab enables you to determine a workstation’s Internet access 
capabilities. You can give a workstation unrestricted access to the Internet, or 
block a workstation from any access to the Internet.  
When workstations with unrestricted Internet access try to access a URL that is 
normally blocked by WebSENSE, their access is logged by WebSENSE as an 
observed access. To give a workstation unrestricted access, select Never in the 
Workstation Override frame, enter the workstation’s IP address in the field that 
follows, and click Add. 
Workstations that have been restricted from accessing the Internet completely will 
not have HTTP access to the Internet. To restrict Internet access for a workstation, 
select Always in the Workstation Override frame, then enter that workstation’s IP 
address in the field that follows, and click the Add button. The IP address will 
appear in the Always Blocked frame.

Messages Tab
Messages Tab
 
By default, when you attempt to access a web site that WebSENSE is blocking, 
you receive the message “Access to the desired web page is not permitted”. 
Instead of using the default message, you can send the user who is trying to access 
the blocked URL to a different web page. For example, if a user tries to access a 
blocked web page, they are sent to a web site that explains that access to the web 
site is not permitted, including any other information you wish. 
To send the user who is trying to access the blocked URL to a different web page, 
select URL in the HTTP Message frame and then enter the URL in the field that 
follows.. 
The rest of the fields in the Messages tab are not usable because the PIX Firewall 
does not support the filtering of other protocols at this time.

Logging Tab
Logging Tab
 
WebSENSE enables you to log URL requests. Specifically, use the Logging tab to 
specify whether you want to log information for prevented requests (requests for 
blocked URLs), observed requests (requests for URLs that are normally blocked, 
but have been made accessible), or both. You can also choose exactly which 
elements of the Internet request you want to log. 
There are four frames within the Logging tab: 
I 
Proxy Activity—Enables you to log attempted access-restricted proxies by 
source address, destination address, destination host, and bytes. 
I 
Prevented Requests—Enables you to log attempted access to sites blocked by 
WebSENSE. 
I 
Observed Request—Enables you to log access to sites that are contained in 
the WebSENSE database, but were not set up for blocking at the time of the 
request. 
I 
Options—Enables you to change how logging is performed. If the Resolve 
Source Host Names checkbox is selected, WebSENSE performs a reverse IP 
address lookup and logs the workstation’s domain name as well as the IP 
address. 
WebSENSE writes log entries to a text file called WebSENSEstats.log, located in 
the WebSENSE directory. The WebSENSE Reporter imports these logs and 
produces reports in graphical or tabular formats.

Control Tab
Control Tab
 
The Control tab lists the version of the Master Database that is currently running 
and allows you to choose the day and time when WebSENSE will download the 
latest Master Database version. By default, WebSENSE contacts the Master 
Database, at the WebSENSE corporate headquarters, every day via the Internet to 
download the latest version. 
Note 
The WebSENSE preference sets that you configure are never deleted when the 
new version of the Master Database is downloaded. 
There are three frames within the Control tab: 
I 
Server Status Running—Contains the server port information for 
WebSENSE corporate headquarters, and enables you to start and stop the 
server. 
I 
Database Information—Displays the version of the Master Database that is 
currently running. 
I 
Database Update Preference—Enables you to set the time period each day 
during which WebSENSE will contact the Master Database for download. 
WebSENSE chooses a random time during the time interval specified in the 
Update between boxes within the Database Update Preferences frame to attempt 
the download of the latest Master Database. If WebSENSE is unable to contact 
the Master Database at the scheduled time, it will retry every 10 minutes during 
the specified times until a new copy of the Master Database is successfully 
downloaded. If a Master Database download is unsuccessful, the Dated field is 
not updated. 
You can set your own date and time for WebSENSE to download the latest 
Master Database by setting the parameters in the Database Update Preferences 
frame. You can also download the Master Database at any time by clicking the 
Now button in the Database Update Preferences frame.

Introduction
This section introduces the authentication, authorization, and accounting concepts 
and how the PIX Firewall supports them.
© 2000, Cisco Systems, Inc. 
www.cisco.com
CSPFA1.01—4-4
Authentication, Authorization,
and Accounting
Authentication, Authorization,
and Accounting
• Authentication
– Who you are
– Can exist without authorization
• Authorization
– What  you can do
– Requires authentication
• Accounting
– What you did
Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) is used to tell the PIX 
Firewall who the user is, what the user can do, and what the user did. 
Authentication is valid without authorization. Authorization is never valid without 
authentication. 
Suppose you have 100 users inside and you want only six of these users to 
perform FTP, Telnet, or HTTP outside the network. Tell the PIX Firewall to 
authenticate outbound traffic and give all 6 users identifications on the TACACS+ 
or RADIUS AAA server. With simple authentication, these six users are 
authenticated with a username and password, and then permitted outside the 
network. The other 94 users cannot go outside the network. The PIX Firewall 
prompts users for their username and password, then passes their username and 
password to the TACACS+ or RADIUS AAA server. Depending on the response, 
the PIX Firewall opens or denies the connection. 
Suppose one of these users, “baduser,” is not to be trusted. You want to allow 
“baduser” to perform FTP, but not HTTP or Telnet to the outside. This means you 
must add authorization, that is, authorize what users can do in addition to 
authenticating who they are. This is only valid with TACACS+. When you add 
authorization to the PIX Firewall, it first sends the untrusted user a username and 
password to the AAA server, then sends an authorization request telling the AAA 
server what command “baduser” is trying to do. With the server set up properly, 
“baduser” is allowed to perform FTP but is not allowed to perform HTTP or 
Telnet.

You can authenticate with the PIX Firewall in one of three ways:
I
Telnet—You get a prompt generated by the PIX Firewall. You have up to 
four chances to log in. If the username or password fail after the fourth 
attempt, the PIX Firewall drops the connection. If authentication and 
authorization are successful, you are prompted for a user  name and password 
by the destination server.
I
FTP—You get a prompt from the FTP program. If you enter an incorrect 
password, the connection is dropped immediately. If the username or 
password on the authentication database differs from the username or 
password on the remote host to which you are accessing via FTP, enter the 
username and password in the following formats:
–
aaa_username@remote_username
–
aaa_password@remote_password
The PIX Firewall sends the aaa_username and aaa_password to the AAA 
server, and if authentication and authorization are successful, the 
remote_username and remote_password are passed to the destination FTP 
server beyond.
Note
Some FTP graphical user interfaces (GUIs) do not display challenge values.
I
HTTP—You see a pop-up window generated by the web browser. If you 
enter an incorrect password, you are prompted again. If the username or 
password on the authentication database differs from the username or 
password on the remote host to which you are using HTTP to access, enter 
the username and password in the following formats:
–
aaa_username@remote_username
–
aaa_password@remote_password

Copyright  2000, Cisco Systems, Inc.
AAA Configuration on the Cisco Secure PIX Firewall
4-5 
The PIX Firewall sends the aaa_username and aaa_password to the AAA 
server, and if authentication and authorization are successful, the 
remote_username and remote_password are passed to the destination HTTP
server.
Keep in mind that browsers cache usernames and passwords. If you believe 
that the PIX Firewall should be timing out an HTTP connection but it is not, 
re-authentication may actually be taking place with the web browser sending 
the cached username and password back to the PIX Firewall. The SYSLOG 
service will show this phenomenon. If Telnet and FTP seem to work 
normally, but HTTP connections do not, this is usually why.
The PIX Firewall supports authentication usernames up to 127 characters and 
passwords of up to 63 characters. A password or username may not contain an at 
(@) character as part of the password or username string.
Note
If PIX Firewalls are in tandem, Telnet authentication works in the same way as a 
single PIX Firewall, but FTP and HTTP authentication have additional complexity 
because you have to enter each password and username with an additional at “@” 
character and password or username for each in-tandem PIX Firewall. 
Note
Once authenticated with HTTP, a user never has to reauthenticate no matter how 
low the PIX Firewall uauth timeout is set.  This is because the browser caches the 
"Authorization: Basic=Uuhjksdkfhk==" string in every subsequent connection to 
that particular site. This can only be cleared when the user exits all instances of 
Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer and restarts.  Flushing the cache is of no 
use.

Cut-Through Proxy Operation
Cut-Through Proxy Operation
Web
server
Cisco Secure ACS
The PIX Firewall gains dramatic performance advantages because of cut-through 
proxy, a patent-pending method of transparently verifying the identity of users at 
the firewall and permitting or denying access to any TCP- or UDP-based 
application. This method eliminates the price and performance impact that UNIX 
system-based firewalls impose in similar configurations, and leverages the 
authentication and authorization services of the Cisco Secure Asynchronous 
Communications Server (ACS).
The PIX Firewall’s cut-through proxy challenges a user initially at the application 
layer, then authenticates against standard TACACS or RADIUS+ databases. After 
the policy is checked, the PIX Firewall shifts the session flow, and all traffic 
flows directly and quickly between the server and the client while maintaining
session state information.

• Identifies the AAA server for a given group tag
pixfirewall (config)# 
Use the aaa-server command to specify AAA server groups. The PIX Firewall 
lets you define separate groups of TACACS+ or RADIUS servers for specifying 
different types of traffic, such as a TACACS+ server for inbound traffic and 
another for outbound traffic. The aaa command references the group tag to direct 
authentication, authorization, or accounting traffic to the appropriate AAA server.
You can have up to 16 tag groups and each group can have up to 16 AAA servers 
for a total of up to 256 TACACS+ or RADIUS servers. When a user logs in, the 
servers are accessed one at a time, starting with the first server you specify in the 
tag group, until a server responds.
The default configuration provides these two aaa-server protocols:
I
aaa-server MYTACACS protocol tacacs+
I
aaa-server RADIUS protocol radius
Note
If you are upgrading from a previous version of PIX Firewall and have aaa 
command statements in your configuration, using the default server groups lets 
you maintain backward compatibility with the aaa command statements in your 
configuration.

Copyright  2000, Cisco Systems, Inc.
AAA Configuration on the Cisco Secure PIX Firewall
4-13
Note
The previous server type option at the end of the aaa authentication and aaa 
accounting commands has been replaced with the aaa-server group tag. Backward 
compatibility with previous versions is maintained by the inclusion of two default 
protocols for TACACS+ and RADIUS.
Note
The PIX Firewall listens for RADIUS on ports 1645 and 1646. If your RADIUS 
server uses ports 1812 and 1813, you will need to reconfigure it to listen on ports 
1645 and 1646.
The syntax for all forms of the aaa-server command is as follows:
aaa-server group_tag (if_name) host server_ip key timeout seconds
no aaa-server group_tag (if_name) host server_ip key timeout seconds
aaa-server group_tag protocol auth_protocol
clear aaa-server [group_tag]
Argument
Description
group_tag
An alphanumeric string that is the name of 
the server group. Use the group_tag in the 
aaa command to associate aaa 
authentication, aaa authorization, and 
aaa accounting command statements to an 
AAA server.
if_name
The interface name on the side that the 
AAA server resides.
host server_ip
The IP address of the TACACS+ or 
RADIUS server.
key
A case-sensitive, alphanumeric keyword of 
up to 127 characters that is the same value 
as the key on the TACACS+ server. Any 
characters entered past 127 are ignored. 
The key is used between the client and 
server for encrypting data between them. 
The key must be the same on both the 
client and server systems. Spaces are not 
permitted in the key, but other special 
characters are.
If a key is not specified, encryption does not 
occur.
timeout seconds
A retransmit timer that specifies the duration 
that the PIX Firewall retries access four 
times to the AAA server before choosing the 
next AAA server. The default is 5 seconds. 
The maximum time is 30 seconds.
For example, if the timeout value is 10 
seconds, PIX Firewall retransmits for 10 
seconds and if no acknowledgment is 
received, tries three times more for a total of 
40 seconds to retransmit data before the 
next AAA server is selected.
protocol auth_protocol
The type of AAA server, either TACACS+ or 
RADIUS.

• Defines traffic to be authenticated
• authen_service = any, ftp, http, or telnet
– any: all TCP traffic
The aaa authentication command enables or disables user authentication 
services. When you start a connection via Telnet, FTP, or HTTP, you are 
prompted for a username and password. A AAA server, designated previously 
with the aaa-server command, verifies whether the username and password are 
correct. If they are correct, the PIX Firewall lets further traffic between the 
authentication server and the connection interact independently through the PIX 
Firewall Cut-Through Proxy feature.
The aaa authentication command is not intended to mandate your security 
policy. The AAA servers determine whether a user can or cannot access the 
system, what services can be accessed, and what IP addresses the user can access. 
The PIX Firewall interacts with Telnet, FTP, and HTTP to display the prompts for 
logging. You can specify that only a single service be authenticated, but this must 
agree with the AAA server to ensure that both the firewall and server agree.
For each IP address, one aaa authentication command is permitted for inbound 
connections and one for outbound connections. The PIX Firewall permits only 
one authentication type per network. For example, if one network connects 
through the PIX Firewall using TACACS+ for authentication, another network 
connecting through the PIX Firewall can authenticate with RADIUS, but one 
network cannot authenticate with both TACACS+ and RADIUS.
Note
The new include and exclude options are not backward compatible with PIX 
Firewall versions 5.0 and earlier. If you downgrade to an earlier version, the aaa 
authentication command statements are removed from your configuration.
The syntax for all forms of the aaa authentication command is as follows:
aaa authentication include | exclude authen_service inbound | outbound|if_name local_ip 
local_mask foreign_ip foreign_mask group_tag

Argument
Description
include
Create a new rule with the specified service

exclude
Create an exception to a previously stated 
rule by excluding the specified service from 
authentication to the specified host. The 
exclude parameter improves the former

a port to exclude to a specific host or hosts.
authen_service
The services that require user 
authentication before they are let through 
the firewall. Use any, ftp, http, or telnet. 
The any value enables authentication for all 
TCP services.
inbound
Authenticate inbound connections. Inbound 
means the connection originates on the 
outside interface and is being directed to 
the inside or any other perimeter interface.
outbound
Authenticate outbound connections. 
Outbound means the connection originates 
on the inside and is being directed to the 
outside or any other perimeter interface.
if_name
Interface name from which users require 
authentication. Use if_name in combination 
with the local_ip address and the 
foreign_ip address to determine where 
access is sought and from whom. The 
local_ip address is always on the interface 
with the highest security level and 
foreign_ip is always on the lowest.
local_ip
The IP address of the host or network of 
hosts that you want to be authenticated. 
You can set this address to 0 to mean all 
hosts and to let the authentication server 
decide which hosts are authenticated.
local_mask
Network mask of local_ip. Always specify a 
specific mask value. Use 0 if the IP address 
is 0. Use 255.255.255.255 for a host.
foreign_ip
The IP address of the hosts you want to 
access the local_ip address. Use 0 to 
mean all hosts.
foreign_mask
Network mask of foreign_ip. Always 
specify a specific mask value. Use 0 if the 
IP address is 0. Use 255.255.255.255 for a 
host.
group_tag
The group tag set with the aaa-server
command.

Authentication of Non-Telnet,
FTP, or HTTP Traffic
• Option 1: Authenticate first by accessing a
Telnet, FTP, or HTTP server before accessing
other services.
• Option 2: Authenticate to the PIX Firewall virtual
Telnet service before accessing other services.
The PIX Firewall authenticates users via Telnet, FTP, or HTTP. But what if users 
need to access a Microsoft file server on port 139 or a Cisco IP/TV server for 
instance? Whenever users are required to authenticate to access services other 
than Telnet, FTP, or HTTP, they need to do one of the following:
I
Option 1: Authenticate first by accessing a Telnet, FTP, or HTTP server 
before accessing other services.
I
Option 2: Authenticate to the PIX Firewall virtual Telnet service before 
accessing other services.
When there are no Telnet, FTP, or HTTP servers to authenticate with, or just to 
simplify authentication for the user, the PIX Firewall allows a virtual Telnet 
authentication option. This permits the user to authenticate directly with the PIX 
Firewall to the virtual Telnet IP address.

Authenticating Out
The virtual Telnet option provides a way to pre-authenticate users who require 
connections through the PIX Firewall using services or protocols that do not 
support authentication. The virtual Telnet IP address is used both to authenticate 
in and authenticate out of the PIX Firewall.
When an unauthenticated user Telnets to the virtual IP address, the user is 
challenged for their username and password, and then authenticated with the 
TACACS+ or RADIUS server. Once authenticated, the user sees the message 
“Authentication Successful” and the authentication credentials are cached in the 
PIX Firewall for the duration of the uauth timeout.
If a user wishes to log out and clear the entry in the PIX Firewall uauth cache, the 
user can again Telnet to the virtual address. The user is prompted for a username 
and password, the PIX Firewall removes the associated credentials from the uauth 
cache, and the user receives a “Logout Successful” message.

Virtual HTTP
Virtual HTTP
• Some Web servers do not understand the PIX
Firewall’s authentication credentials.
• When virtual HTTP is enabled, it redirects the
browser to authenticate first to a virtual Web
server on the PIX Firewall.
• After authentication, the PIX Firewall forwards
the Web request to the intended Web server.
With the virtual HTTP option, web browsers work correctly with the PIX 
Firewall’s HTTP authentication. The PIX Firewall assumes that the AAA server 
database is shared with a web server and automatically provides the AAA server 
and web server with the same information. The virtual HTTP option works with 
the PIX Firewall to authenticate the user, separate the AAA server information 
from the web client’s URL request, and direct the web client to the web server. 
The virtual HTTP option works by redirecting the web browser’s initial 
connection to an IP address, which resides in the PIX Firewall, authenticating the 
user, then redirecting the browser back to the URL that the user originally 
requested. This option is so named because it accesses a virtual HTTP server on 
the PIX Firewall, which in reality does not exist.
This option is especially useful for PIX Firewall interoperability with Microsoft 
IIS, but is useful for other authentication servers. When using HTTP 
authentication to a site running Microsoft IIS that has “Basic text authentication” 
or “NT Challenge” enabled, users may be denied access from the Microsoft IIS 
server. This occurs because the browser appends the string: “Authorization: 
Basic=Uuhjksdkfhk==” to the HTTP GET commands. This string contains the 
PIX Firewall authentication credentials. Windows NT Microsoft IIS servers 
respond to the credentials and assume that a Windows NT user is trying to access 
privileged pages on the server. Unless the PIX Firewall username and password 
combination is exactly the same as a valid Windows NT username and password 
combination on the Microsoft IIS server, the HTTP GET command is denied.
To solve this problem, PIX Firewall redirects the browser’s initial connection to 
its virtual HTTP IP address, authenticates the user, then redirects the browser 
back to the URL that the user originally requested.
Note
Do not set the timeout uauth duration to 0 seconds when using the virtual HTTP 
option. This will prevent HTTP connections to the real web server.

MYTACACS
Use the aaa authentication console command to require authentication 
verification to access the PIX Firewall’s serial, enable, or Telnet consoles. The 
serial console options also log to a Syslog server change made to the 
configuration from the serial console.
Authenticated access to the PIX Firewall console has different types of prompts 
depending on the option you choose. While the enable option allows three tries 
before stopping with an access denied message, both the serial and Telnet
options cause you to be prompted continually until you have successfully logged 
in.
The serial option requests a username and password before the first command-
line prompt on the serial console connection. The telnet option forces you to 
specify a username and password before the first command-line prompt of a 
Telnet console connection. The enable option requests a username and password 
before accessing privileged mode for serial or Telnet connections.
Telnet access to the PIX Firewall console is available from any internal interface 
(not the outside interface) and requires previous use of the telnet command.
Authentication of the serial console creates a potential dead-lock situation if the 
authentication server requests are not answered and you need access to the 
console to attempt diagnosis. If the console login request times out, you can gain 
access to the PIX Firewall from the serial console by entering the PIX Firewall 
username and the enable password.
The maximum password length for accessing the console is 16 characters.

How to Change the
Authentication Timeouts
How to Change the
Authentication Timeouts
• Sets the time interval before users will be required to reauthenticate
– Absolute: Time interval starts at user login
– Inactivity: Time interval for inactive sessions (no traffic)
Use the timeout uauth command to specify how long the cache should be kept 
after the user connections become idle. The timeout command value must be at 
least 2 minutes. Use the clear uauth command to delete all authorization caches 
for all users, which will cause them to have to reauthenticate the next time they 
create a connection.
The inactivity and absolute qualifiers cause users to have to reauthenticate after 
either a period of inactivity or an absolute duration. The inactivity timer starts 
after a connection becomes idle. If a user establishes a new connection before the 
duration of the inactivity timer, the user is not required to reauthenticate. If a user 
establishes a new connection after the inactivity timer expires, the user must 
reauthenticate.
The absolute timer runs continuously, but waits to reprompt the user when the 
user starts a new connection, such as clicking a link after the absolute timer has 
elapsed, then the user is prompted to reauthenticate. The absolute timer must be 
shorter than the xlate timer; otherwise, a user could be reprompted after their 
session already ended.
The inactivity timer give users the best Internet access because they are not 
prompted to regularly reauthenticate. Absolute timers provide security and 
manage the PIX Firewall connections better. By being prompted to reauthenticate 
regularly, users manage their use of the resources more efficiently. Also by being 
reprompted, you minimize the risk that someone will attempt to use another user’s 
access after they leave their workstation, such as in a college computer lab. You 
may want to set an absolute timer during peak hours and an inactivity timer during 
other times.
Both an inactivity timer and an absolute timer can operate at the same time, but 
you should set the absolute timer duration for longer than the inactivity timer. If 
the absolute timer is less than the inactivity timer, the inactivity timer never 
occurs. For example, if you set the absolute timer to 10 minutes and the inactivity

timer to an hour, the absolute timer reprompts the user every 10 minutes, and the 
inactivity timer will never be started.
If you set the inactivity timer to some duration, but the absolute timer to zero, then 
users are only reauthenticated after the inactivity timer elapses. If you set both 
timers to zero, then users have to reauthenticate on every new connection.
Note
Do not set the timeout uauth duration to 0 seconds when using the virtual HTTP 
option or passive FTP.
The syntax for the timeout uauth command is as follows:
timeout uauth [hh:mm:ss] [absolute | inactivity]
show timeout
clear uauth
Argument
Description
uauth hh:mm:ss
Duration before the authentication and 
authorization cache times out and user has 
to re-authenticate next connection. This 
duration must be shorter than the xlate 
values. Set to 0 to disable caching.
absolute
Run uauth timer continuously, but after timer 
elapses, wait to reprompt the user until the 
user starts a new connection, such as 
clicking a link in a web browser. To disable 
absolute, set it to zero (0). Default is 5 
minutes.
inactivity
Start uauth timer after a connection 
becomes idle. Default is 0.

Use the auth-prompt command to change the AAA challenge text for HTTP, 
FTP, and Telnet access. This text displays above the username and password 
prompts that you view when logging in.
Note
Microsoft Internet Explorer only displays up to 37 characters in an authentication 
prompt, Netscape Navigator displays up to 120 characters, and Telnet and FTP 
display up to 235 characters in an authentication prompt. 
The syntax for the auth-prompt command is as follows:
auth-prompt [accept | reject | prompt] string
no auth-prompt [accept | reject | prompt] string
show auth-prompt
clear auth-prompt
Argument
Description
accept
If a user authentication via Telnet is 
accepted, the accept message is displayed.
reject
If a user authentication via Telnet is 
rejected, the reject message is displayed.
prompt 
The AAA challenge prompt string follows 
this keyword. This keyword is optional for 
backward compatibility.
string 
A string of up to 235 alphanumeric 
characters. Special characters should not 
be used; however, spaces and punctuation 
characters are permitted. Entering a 
question mark or pressing the Enter key 
ends the string. (The question mark appears 
in the string.)

Need for Advanced Protocol
Handling
• Some popular protocols or applications
– Negotiate connections to dynamic assigned source or
destination ports or IP addresses
– Embed source or destination port or IP address information
above the network layer
• A good firewall has to inspect packets above the network layer
and do the following as required by the protocol or application:
– Securely open and close negotiated ports or IP addresses for
legitimate client-server connections through the firewall
– Use NAT-relevant instances of IP addresses inside a packet
– Use PAT-relevant instances of ports inside a packet
– Inspect packets for signs of malicious application misuse
Today many corporations use the Internet for business transactions. For the 
corporations to keep their internal networks secure from potential threats from the 
Internet, they can implement firewalls on their internal network. Even though 
these firewalls help protect a corporation’s internal networks from external 
threats, firewalls have caused problems as well: Some of the protocols and 
applications that the corporations use to communicate are not allowed through the 
firewalls. Specifically, protocols need to negotiate FTP, HTTP, H.323, and 
SQL*Net connections to dynamically assigned source or destination ports, or IP 
addresses, through the firewall.
A good firewall has to inspect packets above the network layer and do the 
following as required by the protocol or application:
I
Securely open and close negotiated ports or IP addresses for legitimate client-
server connections through the firewall
I
Use Network Address Translation (NAT)-relevant instances of IP address 
inside a packet
I
Use Port Address Translation (PAT)-relevant instances of ports inside a 
packet
I
Inspect packets for signs of malicious application misuse

Data
Standard mode FTP uses two channels for communications. When a client first 
starts an FTP connection, it opens a standard TCP channel from one of its high-
order ports to port 21 on the server. This is referred to as the command channel. 
When the client requests data from the server, it tells the server to send the data to 
a given high-order port. The server acknowledges the request and initiates a 
connection from its own port 20 to the high-order port that the client requested. 
This is referred to as the data channel.
Because the server initiates the connection to the requested port on the client, it 
was difficult in the past to have firewalls allow this data channel to the client 
without permanently opening port 20 connections from outside servers to inside 
clients for outbound FTP connections. This created a potential vulnerability by 
exposing clients on the inside of the firewall.
For FTP traffic, the PIX Firewall behaves in the following manner:
I
Outbound connections
–
When the client requests data, the PIX Firewall opens a temporary 
inbound conduit for the data channel from the server. This conduit is torn 
down after the data is sent.
I
Inbound connections
–
If a conduit exists allowing inbound connections to an FTP server, and if 
all outbound TCP traffic is implicitly allowed, no special handling is 
required because the server initiates the data channel from the inside.
–
If a conduit exists allowing inbound connections to an FTP server, and if 
all outbound TCP traffic is not implicitly allowed, the PIX Firewall 
opens a temporary conduit for the data channel from the server. This 
conduit is torn down after the data is sent.

Data
Passive mode PFTP also uses two channels for communications. The command 
channel works the same as in a standard FTP connection, but the data channel 
setup works differently. When the client requests data from the server, it asks the 
server if it accepts PFTP connections. If the server accepts PFTP connections, it 
sends the client a high-order port number to use for the data channel. The client 
then initiates the data connection from its own high-order port to the port that the 
server sent.
Because the client initiates both the command and data connections, early 
firewalls could easily support this without exposing inside clients to attack.
For PFTP traffic, the PIX Firewall behaves in the following manner:
I
Outbound connections
–
If all outbound TCP traffic is implicitly allowed, no special handling is 
required because the client initiates both the command and data channels 
from the inside.
–
If all outbound TCP traffic is not implicitly allowed, the PIX Firewall 
opens a temporary conduit for the data channel from the client. This 
conduit is torn down after the data is sent.
I
Inbound connections
–
If a conduit exists allowing inbound connections to a PFTP server, when 
data is requested by the client, the PIX Firewall opens a temporary 
inbound conduit for the data channel initiated by client. This conduit is 
torn down after the data is sent.

By default, the PIX Firewall inspects port 21 connections for FTP traffic. If you 
have FTP servers using ports other than port 21, you need to use the fixup 
protocol ftp command to have the PIX Firewall inspect these other ports for FTP 
traffic.
The fixup protocol ftp command causes the PIX Firewall to do the following for 
FTP traffic on the indicated port:
I
Perform NAT or PAT in packet payload
I
Dynamically create conduits for FTP data connections
I
Log FTP commands (when Syslog is enabled)
Use the no form of the command to disable the inspection of traffic on the 
indicated port for FTP connections. If the fixup protocol ftp command is not 
enabled for a given port, then:
I
Outbound standard FTP will not work properly on that port
I
Outbound passive FTP will work properly on that port as long as outbound 
traffic is not explicitly disallowed
I
Inbound standard FTP will work properly on that port if a conduit to the 
inside server exists
I
Inbound passive FTP will not work properly on that port
Using the no fixup protocol ftp command without any arguments causes the PIX 
Firewall to clear all previous fixup protocol ftp assignments and set port 21 back 
as the default.

Standard Error Output
Remote shell (rsh) uses two channels for communications. When a client first 
starts an rsh connection, it opens a standard TCP channel from one of its high-
order ports to port 514 on the server. The server opens another channel for 
standard error output to the client.
For rsh traffic, the PIX Firewall behaves in the following manner:
I
Outbound connections
–
When standard error messages are sent from the server, the PIX Firewall 
opens a temporary inbound conduit for this channel. This conduit is torn 
down when no longer needed.
I
Inbound connections
–
If a conduit exists allowing inbound connections to an rsh server, and if 
all outbound TCP traffic is implicitly allowed, no special handling is 
required because the server initiates the standard error channel from the 
inside.
–
If a conduit exists allowing inbound connections to an rsh server, and if 
all outbound TCP traffic is not implicitly allowed, the PIX Firewall 
opens a temporary conduit for the standard error channel from the server. 
This conduit is torn down after the messages are sent.

By default, the PIX Firewall inspects port 514 connections for Rsh traffic. If you 
have Rsh servers using ports other than port 514, you need to use the fixup 
protocol rsh command to have the PIX Firewall inspect these other ports for Rsh 
traffic.
The fixup protocol rsh command causes the PIX Firewall to dynamically create 
conduits for Rsh standard error connections for Rsh traffic on the indicated port.
Use the no form of the command to disable the inspection of traffic on the 
indicated port for Rsh connections. If the fixup protocol rsh command is not 
enabled for a given port then
I
Outbound Rsh will not work properly on that port
I
Inbound Rsh will work properly on that port if a conduit to the inside server

Using the no fixup protocol rsh command without any arguments causes the PIX 
Firewall to clear all previous fixup protocol rsh assignments and set port 514 
back as the default.

TCP: Connection Request
SQL*Net only uses one channel for communications but it could be redirected to 
a different port, and even more commonly to a different secondary server 
altogether. When a client first starts an SQL*Net connection, it opens a standard 
TCP channel from one of its high-order ports to port 1521 on the server. The 
server then proceeds to redirect the client to a different port or IP address. The 
client tears down the initial connection and establishes the second connection.
For SQL*Net traffic, the PIX Firewall behaves in the following manner:
I
Outbound connections
–
If all outbound TCP traffic is implicitly allowed, no special handling is 
required because the client initiates all TCP connections from the inside.
–
If all outbound TCP traffic is not implicitly allowed, the PIX Firewall 
opens a conduit for the redirected channel between the server and the 
client.
I
Inbound connections
–
If a conduit exists allowing inbound connections to an SQL*Net server, 
the PIX Firewall opens an inbound conduit for the redirected channel.

By default, the PIX Firewall inspects port 1521 connections for SQL*Net traffic. 
If you have SQL*Net servers using ports other than port 1521, you must use the 
fixup protocol sqlnet command to have the PIX Firewall inspect these other 
ports for SQL*Net traffic.
The fixup protocol sqlnet command causes the PIX Firewall to do the following 
for SQL*Net traffic on the indicated port:
I

Why Multimedia Is an Issue
Why Multimedia Is an Issue
• Multimedia applications
behave in unique ways
– Use dynamic ports
– Transmit request using
TCP and get responses in
UDP or TCP
– Use the same port for
source and destination
• The PIX Firewall
– Dynamically opens and
closes conduits for secure
multimedia connections
– Supports multimedia with
or without NAT
Multimedia applications may transmit requests on TCP, get responses on UDP or 
TCP, use dynamic ports, may use the same port for source and destination, and so 
on. Every application behaves in a different way. Implementing support for all 
multimedia applications using a single secure method is very difficult. Two 
examples of multimedia applications are given below:
I
RealAudio sends the originating request to TCP port 7070. The RealAudio 
server replies with multiple UDP streams anywhere from UDP port 6970 
through 7170 on the client machine.
I
The CUseeMe client sends the originating request from TCP port 7649 to 
TCP port 7648. The CUseeMe datagram is unique in that it includes the 
legitimate IP address in the header as well as in the payload, and sends 
responses from UDP port 7648 to UDP port 7648.
The PIX Firewall dynamically opens and closes UDP ports for secure multimedia 
connections. You do not need to open a large range of ports, which creates a 
security risk, or have to reconfigure any application clients.
Also, the PIX Firewall supports multimedia with or without NAT. Many firewalls 
that cannot support multimedia with NAT limit multimedia usage to only 
registered users, or require exposure of inside IP addresses to the Internet. Lack of 
support for multimedia with NAT often forces multimedia vendors to join 
proprietary alliances with firewall vendors to accomplish compatibility for their 
applications.

and some times two additional UDP channels. RTSP applications use the well-
known port 554, usually TCP and rarely UDP. RFC 2326 requires only TCP so 
the PIX Firewall only supports TCP. This TCP channel is the control channel and 
is used to negotiate the other two UDP cha,nnels depending on the transport mode 
that is configured on the client.
The first UDP channel is the data connection and may use one of the following 
transport modes:
I
Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP)
I
Real Data Transport Protocol (RDT)
The second UDP channel is another control channel and it may use one of the 
following modes:
I
Real-Time Control Protocol (RTCP)
I
UDP Resend
RTSP supports a TCP-only mode. This mode contains only one TCP connection, 
which is used as the control and data channels. Because this mode contains only 
one constant standard TCP connection, no special handling by the PIX Firewall is 
required.

UDP: RTCP Reports
UDP: RTP Data
In standard RTP mode, the following three channels are used by RTSP:
I
TCP control channel—Standard TCP connection initiated from the client to 
the server.
I
RTP data channel—Simplex (unidirectional) UDP session used for media 
delivery using the RTP packet format from the sever to the client. The 
client’s port is always an even numbered port.
I
RTCP reports—Duplex (bidirectional) UDP session used to provide 
synchronization information to the client and packet loss information to the 
server. The RTCP port is always the next consecutive port from the RTP data 
port.
For standard RTP mode RTSP traffic, the PIX Firewall behaves in the following 
manner:
I
Outbound connections
–
After the client and the server negotiate the transport mode and the ports 
to use for the sessions, the PIX Firewall opens temporary inbound 
conduits for the RTP data channel and RTCP report channel from the 
server.
I
Inbound connections
–
If a conduit exists allowing inbound connections to an RTSP server, and 
if all outbound UDP traffic is implicitly allowed, no special handling is 
required since the server initiates the data and report channel from the 
inside.
–
If a conduit exists allowing inbound connections to an RTSP server, and 
if all outbound TCP traffic is not implicitly allowed, the PIX Firewall 
opens temporary conduits for the data and report channels from the 
server.

the PIX Firewall opens a temporary inbound conduit for the UDP data 
channel from the server.
–
If outbound UDP traffic is not implicitly allowed, and after the client and

• Defines ports for RTSP connections
– No RTSP fixup is enabled by default. RFC2326 port is 554.
– RTSP dynamically opens UDP connections as required by the RTSP
transport.
– PAT and dual NAT are not currently supported.
• If disabled
– UDP transport modes are disallowed.
– TCP transport modes are allowed (TCP connection rules apply).
By default, the PIX Firewall does not inspect any ports for RTSP connections. To 
enable the PIX Firewall to inspect specific ports for RTSP traffic, such as the 
standard port 554, use the fixup protocol rtsp command.
The fixup protocol rtsp command causes the PIX Firewall to dynamically create 
conduits for RTSP UDP channels for RTSP traffic on the indicated port.
Use the no form of the command to disable the inspection of traffic on the 
indicated port for RTSP connections. If the fixup protocol sqlnet command is not 
enabled for a given port, then neither outbound or inbound RTSP will work 
properly on that port. 
Using the no fixup protocol rtsp command without any arguments causes the 
PIX Firewall to clear all previous fixup protocol rtsp assignments.

H.323 is more complicated than other traditional protocols because it uses two 
TCP connections and several UDP sessions for a single “call.” (Only one of the 
TCP connections goes to a well-known port; all the other ports are negotiated and 
are temporary.) Furthermore, the content of the streams is far more difficult for 
firewalls to understand than existing protocols because H.323 encodes packets 
using Abstract Syntax Notation, or ASN.1.
Other protocols and standards supported within H.323 are as follows:

–
Potential mail server vulnerabilities are exposed
Mail Guard provides a safe conduit for Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) 
connections from the outside to an inside e-mail server. Mail Guard allows a mail 
server to be deployed within the internal network without it being exposed to 
known security problems with some mail server implementations.
Only the SMTP commands specified in RFC 821 section 4.5.1 are allowed to a 
mail server. This are: HELO, MAIL, RCPT, DATA, RSET, NOOP, and QUIT.
By default, the PIX Firewall inspects port 25 connections for SMTP traffic. If you 
have SMTP servers using ports other than port 25, you must use the fixup 
protocol smtp command to have the PIX Firewall inspect these other ports for 
SMTP traffic.
Use the no form of the command to disable the inspection of traffic on the 
indicated port for SMTP connections. If the fixup protocol smtp command is not 
enabled for a given port, then potential mail server vulnerabilities are exposed. 
Using the no fixup protocol smtp command without any arguments causes the 
PIX Firewall to clear all previous fixup protocol smtp assignments and set port 
25 back as the default.

DNS Guard
DNS Guard
• DNS Guard is always on.
• After the client does a DNS
request, a dynamic conduit
allows UDP packets to
return from the DNS server.
– The default UDP timer
expires in two minutes.
• The DNS server response
is recognized by the
firewall, which closes the
dynamic UDP conduit
immediately.
– The DNS server does
not wait for UDP timer
to expire.
DNS Guard identifies an outbound DNS query request and only allows a single 
DNS response back to the sender. A host may query several servers for a response 
in case the first server is slow in responding; however, only the first answer to the 
specific question will be allowed back in. All the additional answers from other 
servers will be dropped. This feature is always enabled and does the following:
I
Automatically tears down the UDP conduit on the PIX Firewall as soon as 
the DNS response is received. Does not wait for the default UDP timer to 
close the session.
I
Prevents against UDP session hijacking and denial of service (DoS) attacks.

–
Operates on all interfaces
Use the sysopt security fragguard command to enable the Fragmentation Guard 
feature. This feature enforces two addition security checks on IP packets in 
addition to the security checks recommended by RFC 1858 against the many IP 
fragment style attacks: teardrop, land, and so on. First, each non-initial IP 
fragment is required to be associated with an already-seen valid initial IP 
fragment. Second, IP fragments are rated 100 full IP fragmented packets per 
second to each internal host. The Fragmentation Guard feature operates on all 
interfaces in the PIX Firewall and cannot be selectively enabled or disabled by 
interface.
PIX Firewall uses the security fragguard command to enforce the security 
policy determined by an access-list permit or access -list deny command to 
permit or deny packets through the PIX Firewall.
Note
Use of the sysopt security fragguard command breaks normal IP fragmentation 
conventions. However, not using this command exposes PIX Firewall protected 
hosts to the possibility of IP fragmentation attacks. Cisco recommends that packet 
fragmentation not be permitted on the network if at all possible.
Note
If the PIX Firewall is used as a tunnel for FDDI packets between routers, the 
Fragmentation Guard feature should be disabled.
Note
Because Linux sends IP fragments in reverse order, fragmented Linux packets will 
not pass through the PIX Firewall with the sysopt security fragguard enabled.

The floodguard command lets you reclaim PIX Firewall resources if the user 
authentication (uauth) subsystem runs out of resources. If an inbound or outbound 
uauth connection is being attacked or overused, the PIX Firewall actively reclaims 
TCP user resources. When the resources are depleted, the PIX Firewall lists 
messages about it being out of resources or out of tcpusers. If the PIX Firewall 
uauth subsystem is depleted, TCP user resources in different states are reclaimed 
depending on urgency in the following order:
1. Timewait
2. FinWait

SYN flood attacks, also known as TCP flood or half-open connections attacks, are 
common DoS attacks perpetrated against IP servers. The attacker spoofs a 
nonexistent source IP address or IP addresses on the network of the target host, 
and floods the target with SYN packets pretending to come from the spoofed host. 
SYN packets to a host are the first step in the three-way handshake of a TCP-type 
connection; therefore, the target responds as expected with SYN-ACK packets 
destined to the spoofed host or hosts. Because these SYN-ACK packets are sent to 
hosts that do not exist, the target sits and waits for the corresponding ACK 
packets that never show up. This causes the target to overflow its port buffer with 
embryonic or half-open connections and stop responding to legitimate requests.

Failover
The failover function for the Cisco Secure PIX Firewall™ provides a safeguard in 
case a PIX Firewall fails. Specifically, when one PIX Firewall fails, another 
immediately takes its place.
In the failover process, there are two PIX Firewalls: the primary PIX Firewall and 
the secondary PIX Firewall. The primary PIX Firewall functions as the active PIX 
Firewall, performing normal network functions. The secondary PIX Firewall 
functions as the standby PIX Firewall, ready to take control should the active PIX 
Firewall fail to perform. When the primary PIX Firewall fails, the secondary PIX 
Firewall becomes active while the primary PIX Firewall goes on standby. This 
entire process is called failover.
The primary PIX Firewall is connected to the secondary PIX Firewall through a 
failover connection: a failover cable. The failover cable has one end labeled 
primary, which plugs into the primary PIX Firewall, and the other end labeled 
secondary, which plugs into the secondary PIX Firewall.
A failover occurs when one of the following situations takes place:
I
A power-off or a power-down condition occurs on the active PIX Firewall
I
The active PIX Firewall is rebooted
I
A link goes down on the active PIX Firewall for more than 30 seconds
I
The message, “Failover active” occurs on the standby PIX Firewall
I
Block memory exhaustion occurs for 15 consecutive seconds or more on the 
active PIX Firewall

IP Address for Failover
on PIX Firewalls
IP Address for Failover
on PIX Firewalls
When actively functioning, the primary PIX Firewall uses system IP addresses 
and MAC addresses. The secondary PIX Firewall, when on standby, uses failover 
IP addresses and MAC addresses.
When the primary PIX Firewall fails and the secondary PIX Firewall becomes 
active, the secondary PIX Firewall assumes the system IP addresses and MAC 
addresses of the primary PIX Firewall. Then the primary PIX Firewall, 
functioning in standby, assumes the failover IP addresses and MAC addresses of 
the secondary PIX Firewall.

Configuration Replication
Configuration Replication
Configuration replication occurs
• When the standby firewall completes its initial
bootup.
• As commands are entered on the active
firewall.
• By entering the write standby command.
Configuration replication is when the configuration of the primary PIX Firewall is 
replicated to the secondary PIX Firewall. To perform configuration replication, 
both the primary and secondary PIX Firewalls must be configured exactly the 
same and running the same software release. Configuration replication occurs 
over the failover cable from the active PIX Firewall to the standby PIX Firewall 
in three ways:
I
When the standby PIX Firewall completes its initial bootup, the active PIX 
Firewall replicates its entire configuration to the standby PIX Firewall.
I
As commands are entered on the active PIX Firewall, they are sent across the 
failover cable to the standby PIX Firewall.
I
By entering the write standby command on the active PIX Firewall, which 
forces the entire configuration in memory to be sent to the standby PIX 
Firewall.
Configuration replication only occurs from memory to memory. Because this is 
not a permanent place to store configurations, you must use the write memory
command to write the configuration into Flash memory. If a failover occurs 
during the replication, the new active PIX Firewall will have only a partial 
configuration. The newly active PIX Firewall will then reboot itself to recover the 
configuration from the Flash memory or resynchronize with the newly standby 
PIX Firewall. 
When replication starts, the PIX Firewall console displays the message “Sync 
Started”, and when complete, displays the message “Sync Completed”. During 
replication, information cannot be entered on the PIX Firewall console. 
Replication can take a long time to complete for a large configuration because the 
failover cable is used.

Configure Failover
This section discusses what failover and stateful failover modes are, and how to 
configure stateful failover.
© 2000, Cisco Systems, Inc. 
www.cisco.com
CSPFA 1.01—6-7
Failover and Stateful Failover
Failover and Stateful Failover
• Failover
– Connections are dropped
– Client applications must reconnect
– Provides redundancy
• Stateful failover
– Connections remain active
– No client applications need to reconnect
– Provides redundancy and stateful connection
As stated earlier in the chapter, failover enables the standby PIX Firewall to take 
over the duties of the active PIX Firewall when the active PIX Firewall fails. 
There are two types of failover:
I
Failover—When the active PIX Firewall fails and the standby PIX Firewall 
becomes active, all connections are lost and client applications must perform 
a new connection to restart communication through the PIX Firewall. The 
disconnection happens because the active PIX Firewall does not pass the 
stateful connection information to the standby PIX Firewall. 
I
Stateful failover—When the active PIX Firewall fails and the standby PIX 
Firewall becomes active, the same connection information is available at the 
new active PIX Firewall, and end-user applications are not required to do a 
reconnect to keep the same communication session. The connections remain 
because the stateful failover feature passes per-connection stateful 
information to the standby PIX Firewall.
Stateful failover requires an 100 Mbps Ethernet interface to be used exclusively 
for passing state information between the two PIX Firewalls. This interface can be 
connected to any of the following:
I
Category 5 crossover cable directly connecting the primary PIX Firewall to 
the secondary PIX Firewall
I
100BaseTX half-duplex hub using straight Category 5 cables

Copyright  2000, Cisco Systems, Inc.
Cisco Secure PIX Firewall Failover
6-7 
I
100BaseTX full duplex on a dedicated switch or dedicated virtual LAN 
(VLAN) of a switch
Note
The PIX Firewall does not support the use of either Token Ring or FDDI for the 
stateful failover dedicated interface. Data is passed over the dedicated interface 
using IP protocol 105. No hosts or routers should be on this interface.

Failover Interface Test
Failover Interface Test
• Link Up/Down test—Test the NIC card itself
• Network Activity test—Received network
activity test
• ARP test—Reading the PIX Firewall’s ARP
cache for the 10 most recently acquired entries
• Broadcast Ping test—Sending out a broadcast
ping request
Both the primary and secondary PIX Firewalls send special failover “hello” 
packets to each other over all network interfaces and the failover cable every 15 
seconds to make sure that everything is working. When a failure occurs in the 
active PIX Firewall, and it is not because of a loss of power in the standby PIX 
Firewall, failover begins a series of tests to determine which PIX Firewall has 
failed. The purpose of these tests is to generate network traffic to determine which 
(if either) PIX Firewall has failed. 
At the start of each test, each PIX Firewall clears its received packet count for its 
interfaces. At the conclusion of each test, each PIX Firewall looks to see if it has 
received any traffic. If it has, the interface is considered operational. If one PIX 
Firewall receives traffic for a test and the other PIX Firewall does not, the PIX 
Firewall that did not receive traffic is considered failed. If neither PIX Firewall 
has received traffic, then the tests continue.
The following are the four different tests used to test for failover:
I
LinkUp/Down—This is a test of the NIC card itself. If an interface card is 
not plugged into an operational network, it is considered failed (for example, 
the hub or switch has failed, has a failed port, or a cable is unplugged). If this 
test does not find anything, the Network Activity test begins.
I
Network Activity—This is a received network activity test. The PIX Firewall 
counts all received packets for up to five seconds. If any packets are received 
at any time during this interval, the interface is considered operational and 
testing stops. If no traffic is received, the ARP test begins.
I
ARP—The ARP test consists of reading the PIX Firewall’s ARP cache for 
the ten most recently acquired entries. The PIX Firewall sends ARP requests 
one at a time to these machines, attempting to stimulate network traffic. After 
each request, the PIX Firewall counts all received traffic for up to five 
seconds. If traffic is received, the interface is considered operational. If no 
traffic is received, an ARP request is sent to the next machine. If at the end of 
the list no traffic has been received, the ping test begins.

6-9 
I
Broadcast Ping—The ping test consists of sending out a broadcast ping 
request. The PIX Firewall then counts all received packets for up to five 
seconds. If any packets are received at any time during this interval, the 
interface is considered operational and testing stops. If no traffic is received, 
the testing starts over again with the ARP test.

VPN Configuration with the Cisco Secure PIX Firewall
7-3 
The Cisco Secure PIX Firewall™ Enables a 
Secure VPN
A Virtual Private Network (VPN) is a service offering secure, reliable 
connectivity over a shared, public network infrastructure such as the Internet. 
Because the infrastructure is shared, connectivity can be provided at lower cost 
than existing dedicated private networks. 
The PIX Firewall is a powerful enabler of VPN services. The PIX Firewall’s high 
performance, conformance to open standards, and ease of configuration make it a 
versatile VPN gateway. 
The PIX Firewall VPN chapter covers the basics of IPSec and PIX Firewall VPNs 
with a focus on PIX Firewall gateway to PIX Firewall gateway communications.

PIX Firewall VPN
The PIX Firewall enables VPNs in several topologies, as illustrated in the figure:
I
PIX to PIX secure VPN gatewayTwo or more PIX Firewalls can enable a 
VPN, which secures traffic from devices behind the PIX Firewalls. The 
secure VPN gateway topology prevents the user from having to implement 
VPN devices or software inside the network, making the secure gateway 
transparent to users.
I
PIX to Cisco IOS™ router secure VPN gatewayThe PIX Firewall and 
Cisco router, running Cisco Secure VPN software, can interoperate to create 
a secure VPN gateway between networks.
I
Cisco Secure VPN Client to PIX via dialupThe PIX Firewall can become a 
VPN endpoint for the Cisco Secure VPN Client over a dialup network. The 
dialup network can consist of ISDN, Public Switched Telephone Network 

7-4

(PSTN) (analog modem), or digital subscriber line (DSL) communication 
channels.
I
Cisco Secure VPN Client to PIX via networkThe PIX Firewall can become 
a VPN endpoint for the Cisco Secure VPN Client over an IP network.
I
Other vendor products to PIXProducts from other vendors can connect to 
the PIX Firewall if they conform to open VPN standards.
A VPN itself can be constructed in a number of scenarios. The most common are 
as follows:
I
Internet VPNA private communications channel over the public access 
Internet. This type of VPN can be divided into the following:
–
Connecting remote offices across the Internet.
–
Connecting remote dial users to their home gateway via an Internet 
Service Provider (ISP) (sometimes called a Virtual Private Dial Network 
or VPDN).
I
Intranet VPNA private communication channel within an enterprise or 
organization that may or may not involve traffic traversing a WAN.
I
Extranet VPNA private communication channel between two or more 
separate entities that may involve data traversing the Internet or some other 
WAN.
I
In all cases the VPN or tunnel consists of two endpoints that may be 
represented by PIX Firewalls, Cisco routers, individual client workstations 
running the Cisco Secure VPN Client, or other vendors’ VPN products that 
conform to open standards.

IPSec
Internet
The PIX 5.1 Firewall uses the industry-standard IP Security (IPSec) protocol suite 
to enable advanced VPN features. The PIX IPSec implementation is based on 
Cisco IOS IPSec that runs in Cisco routers. 
IPSec provides a mechanism for secure data transmission over IP networks, 
ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of data communications over 
unprotected networks such as the Internet.
IPSec enables the following PIX Firewall VPN features:
I
Data confidentialityThe IPSec sender can encrypt packets before 
transmitting them across a network.
I
Data integrityThe IPSec receiver can authenticate IPSec peers and packets 
sent by the IPSec sender to ensure that the data has not been altered during 
transmission.
I
Data origin authenticationThe IPSec receiver can authenticate the source 
of the IPSec packets sent. This service is dependent upon the data integrity 
service.
I
Anti-replayThe IPSec receiver can detect and reject replayed packets, 
helping prevent spoofing and man-in-the-middle attacks.

IPSec
The PIX Firewall uses the open IPSec protocol to enable secure VPNs. IPSec is a 
set of security protocols and algorithms used to secure data at the network layer. 
IPSec and related security protocols conform to open standards promulgated by 
the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and documented RFCs and IETF-draft 
papers.
IPSec acts at the network layer, protecting and authenticating IP packets between 
a PIX Firewall and other participating IPSec devices (peers), such as PIX 
Firewalls, Cisco routers, the Cisco Secure VPN Client, and other IPSec-compliant 
products.
IPSec can be used to scale from small to very large networks. It is included in PIX 
Firewall version 5.0 and later.

IPSec 
IPSec is a framework of open standards that provides data confidentiality, data 
integrity, and data authentication between participating peers at the IP layer. 
IPSec can be used to protect one or more data flows between IPSec peers. IPSec is 
documented in a series of Internet RFCs, all available at 
http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/ipsec-charter.html. The overall IPSec 
implementation is guided by “Security Architecture for the Internet Protocol,” 
RFC 2401. IPSec consists of the following two main protocols:
I
Authentication Header (AH)A security protocol that provides 
authentication and optional replay-detection services. AH acts as a “digital 
signature” to ensure that data in the IP packet has not been tampered with. 
AH does not provide data encryption and decryption services. AH can be 
used either by itself or with Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP).

7-8 
Cisco Secure PIX Firewall Advanced 1.01
Copyright  2000, Cisco Systems, Inc.
I
Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP)A security protocol that provides 
data confidentiality and protection with optional authentication and replay-
detection services. The PIX Firewall uses ESP to encrypt the data payload of 
IP packets. ESP can be used either by itself or in conjunction with AH.
IKE
IKE is a hybrid protocol that provides utility services for IPSec: authentication of 
the IPSec peers, negotiation of IKE and IPSec security associations, and 
establishment of keys for encryption algorithms used by IPSec. IKE is 
synonymous with ISAKMP in PIX Firewall configuration. 
SA
The concept of a security association (SA) is fundamental to IPSec. An SA is a 
connection between IPSec peers that determines the IPSec services available 
between the peers, similar to a TCP or UDP port. Each IPSec peer maintains an 
SA database in memory containing SA parameters. SAs are uniquely identified by 
IPSec peer address, security protocol, and security parameter index (SPI). You 
will need to configure SA parameters and monitor SAs on the PIX Firewall.
DES
DES is used to encrypt and decrypt packet data. DES is used by both IPSec and 
IKE. DES uses a 56-bit key, ensuring high performance encryption.
3DES
3DES is a variant of DES, which iterates three times with three separate keys, 
effectively doubling the strength of DES. 3DES is used by IPSec to encrypt and 
decrypt data traffic. 3DES uses a 168-bit key, ensuring strong encryption.
DH
Diffie-Hellman is a public-key cryptography protocol. It allows two parties to 
establish a shared secret key over an insecure communications channel. DH is 
used within IKE to establish session keys. 768-bit and 1024-bit DH groups are 
supported in the PIX Firewall. The 1024-bit group is more secure.
MD5
MD5 is a hash algorithm used to authenticate packet data. The PIX Firewall uses 
the MD5 hashed message authentication code (HMAC) variant which provides an 
additional level of hashing. A hash is a one-way encryption algorithm that takes 
an input message of arbitrary length and produces a fixed-length output message. 
IKE, AH, and ESP use MD5 for authentication.
 SHA-1 
SHA is a hash algorithm used to authenticate packet data. The PIX Firewall uses 
the SHA-1 HMAC variant which provides an additional level of hashing. IKE, 
AH, and ESP use SHA-1 for authentication.

VPN Configuration with the Cisco Secure PIX Firewall
7-9 
RSA Signatures
RSA is a public-key cryptographic system used for authentication. IKE on the PIX 
Firewall uses a DH exchange to determine secret keys on each IPSec peer used by 
encryption algorithms. The DH exchange can be authenticated with RSA (or pre-
shared keys).
CA
The certificate authority support of the PIX Firewall allows the IPSec-protected 
network to scale by providing the equivalent of a digital identification card to 
each device. When two IPSec peers wish to communicate, they exchange digital 
certificates to prove their identities (thus removing the need to manually exchange 
public keys with each peer or to manually specify a shared key at each peer). The 
digital certificates are obtained from a CA. CA support on the PIX Firewall uses 
RSA signatures to authenticate the CA exchange.

Overview
IPSec Configuration Tasks
Overview
Task 1—Prepare to Configure VPN
Support.
Task 2—Configure IKE Parameters.
Task 3—Configure IPSec Parameters.
Task 4—Test and Verify VPN
Configuration.
The rest of this chapter demonstrates how to configure an IPSec-based VPN 
between two PIX Firewalls operating as secure gateways, using pre-shared keys 
for authentication. The IPSec configuration process can be summed up as two 
major tasks: configuring an IPSec encryption policy, and applying the policy to an 
interface. 
The four overall tasks used to configure IPSec encryption on the PIX Firewall are 
summarized below. Subsequent sections of this chapter discuss each configuration 
task in greater detail. The following are the four tasks:
I
Task 1Preparing to for configure VPN support. This task consists of 
several steps that determine IPSec policies, ensure that the network works, 
and ensure that the PIX Firewall can support IPSec.
I
Task 2Configuring IKE parameters. This task consists of several 
configuration steps that ensure that IKE can set up secure channels to desired 
IPSec peers. IKE can set up IPSec SAs, enabling IPSec sessions. IKE 
negotiates IKE parameters and sets up IKE SAs during an IKE phase one 
exchange called “main mode.”
I
Task 3Configure IPSec parameters. This task consists of several 
configuration steps that specify IPSec SA parameters between peers, and set 
global IPSec values. IKE negotiates SA parameters and sets up IPSec SAs 
during an IKE phase two exchange called “quick mode.”

Task 4Test and verify VPN configuration. After you configure IPSec, you 
will need to verify you have configured it correctly, and ensure that it works.

• Step 3. Ensuring that the network works 
       without encryption
• Step 4. Implicitly permitting IPSec packets to
       bypass PIX Firewall access lists, 
       access groups, and conduits
Configuring IPSec encryption can be complicated. You must plan in advance if 
you want to configure IPSec encryption correctly the first time and minimize 
misconfiguration. You should begin this task by defining the overall security 
needs and strategy based on the overall company security policy. Some planning 
steps include the following:
Step 1
Determining the IKE (IKE phase one) policyDetermine the IKE policies 
between peers based on the number and location of IPSec peers. 
Step 2
Determining the IPSec (IKE phase two) policyYou will need to identify IPSec 
peer details such as IP addresses and IPSec modes. You then configure crypto 
maps to gather all IPSec policy details together.
Step 3
Ensuring that the network works without encryption (no excuses!)Ensure that 
basic connectivity has been achieved between IPSec peers using the desired IP 
services before configuring PIX Firewall IPSec.
Step 4
Implicitly permitting IPSec packets to bypass PIX access lists, access groups and 
conduits. In this step you will must enter the sysopt connection permit-ipsec
command.

An IKE policy defines a combination of security parameters to be used during the 
IKE negotiation. You should determine the IKE policy, then configure it. Some 
planning steps include:
I
Determining IKE phase one (ISAKMP) policies for peersAn IKE policy 
defines a combination of security parameters to be used during the IKE 
negotiation. Each IKE negotiation begins by each peer agreeing on a 
common (shared) IKE policy. The IKE policy suites must be determined in 
advance of configuration.
I
Determining key distribution methods based on the numbers and locations of 
IPSec peers—You may wish to use a CA server to support scalability of 
IPSec peers. You must then configure IKE to support the selected key 
distribution method.
I
Identifying IPSec peer router IP addresses and hostnamesYou will need to 
determine the details of all of the IPSec peers that will use IKE for 
establishing SAs.
The goal of advance planning is to minimize misconfiguration.

An IKE policy defines a combination of security parameters to be used during the 
IKE negotiation. A group of policies makes up a “protection suite” of multiple 
policies that enable IPSec peers to establish IKE sessions and SAs with a 
minimum of configuration.
Create IKE Policies for a Purpose
IKE negotiations must be protected, so each IKE negotiation begins by each peer 
agreeing on a common (shared) IKE policy. This policy states which security 
parameters will be used to protect subsequent IKE negotiations.
After the two peers agree upon a policy, the security parameters of the policy are 
identified by a security association established at each peer, and these security 
associations apply to all subsequent IKE traffic during the negotiation.
You can create multiple, prioritized policies at each peer to ensure that at least 
one policy will match a remote peer’s policy.

You can select specific values for each IKE parameter, per the IKE standard. You 
choose one value over another based on the security level you desire and the type 
of IPSec peer to which you will connect.
There are five parameters to define in each IKE policy, as outlined in the figure

An IKE policy defines a combination of security parameters to be used during the 
IKE negotiation. A group of policies makes up a “protection suite” of multiple 
policies that enable IPSec peers to establish IKE sessions and SAs with a 
minimum of configuration.
You should determine IKE policy details for each IPSec peer before configuring 
IKE. The figure shows a summary of some IKE policy details that will be 
configured in the examples in this chapter.

Planning includes the following: 
Select IPSec algorithms and parameters
for optimal security and performance.
Identify IPSec peer PIX details.
Determine IP addresses and applications
of hosts to be protected.

Planning for IPSec (IKE phase two) is another important step you should 
complete  before actually configuring the PIX Firewall. Items to determine at this 
stage include the following: 
I
Select IPSec algorithms and parameters for optimal security and 
performance. You should determine what type of IPSec security will be used 
to secure interesting traffic. Some IPSec parameters require you to make 
tradeoffs between high performance and stronger security.
I
Identify IPSec peer details. You must identify the IP addresses and 
hostnames of all IPSec peers you will connect to.
I
Determine IP addresses and applications of hosts to be protected at the local 
peer and remote peer.
I
Decide whether security associations are manually established or are 
established via IKE.
Note
IPSec security associations can be configured manually, but is not recommended 
because IKE is easier to configure.
The goal of this planning step is to gather the precise data you will need in later 
steps to minimize misconfiguration.

Determining network design details includes defining a more detailed security 
policy for protecting traffic. You can then use the detailed policy to help select 
IPSec transform sets and modes of operation. Your security policy should answer 
the following questions:
I
What protections are required or are acceptable for the protected traffic?
I
What traffic should or should not be protected?
I
Which PIX interfaces are involved in protecting internal nets, external nets, 
or both?
I
What are the peer IPSec endpoints for the traffic?
I
How should SAs be established?
The figure above shows a summary of IPSec encryption policy details that will be 
configured in the examples in this chapter.

Configure an IKE Phase one policy with the isakmp policy command to match 
expected IPSec peers: 
(a) Identify the policy with a unique priority number: 
pixfirewall(config)# isakmp policy priority 
(b) Specify the encryption algorithm. The default is des: 
pixfirewall(config)# isakmp policy priority encryption des | 3des 
(c) Specify the hash algorithm. The default is sha: 
pixfirewall(config)# isakmp policy priority hash md5 | sha 
(d) Specify the authentication method: 
pixfirewall(config)# isakmp policy priority authentication pre-share | rsa-sig 
Note 
If you specify the authentication method of pre-shared keys, you must manually 
configure these keys, which is outlined in Step 3. 
(e) Specify the Diffie-Hellman group identifier. The default is group 1: 
pixfirewall(config)# isakmp policy priority group 1|2 
(f) Specify the IKE security association’s lifetime. The default is 86400. 
pixfirewall(config)# isakmp policy priority lifetime seconds 
Note 
PIX Firewall software has preset default values. If you enter a default value for a 
given policy parameter, it will not be written in the configuration. If you do not 
specify a value for a given policy parameter, the default value is assigned. You can 
observe configured and default values with the show isakmp policy command.

Step 3 
Configure the IKE pre-shared key.  
pixfirewall(config)# isakmp key keystring address peer-address [netmask] 
The keystring is any combination of alphanumeric characters up to 128 bytes. 
This pre-shared key must be identical at both peers. 
The peer-address and netmask should point to the IP address of the IPSec peer. A 
wildcard peer address and netmask of 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 may be configured to share 
the pre-shared key among many peers. However, Cisco strongly recommends 
using a unique key for each peer. 
You can also use the peer’s hostname for the pre-shared key.

Task 3— Configure IPSec Parameters 
The next major task in configuring PIX Firewall IPSec is to configure the 
previously gathered IPSec parameters. This section presents the steps used to 
configure IPSec parameters for IKE pre-shared keys: 
Step 1 
Configure interesting traffic. 
Step 2

Step 1—Configure
Interesting Traffic
• Permit = encrypt
• Deny = do not encrypt
• Access list selects IP traffic by address, network, or subnet
 
Step 1 
Configure interesting traffic with crypto access lists: 
pixfirewall(config)# access-list access-list-name {deny | permit} protocol source 
source-netmask destination destination-netmask  
I 
permit causes all IP traffic that matches the specified conditions to be 
protected by crypto, using the policy described by the corresponding crypto 
map entry. 
I 
deny instructs the PIX Firewall to route traffic in the clear. 
I 
source and destination are networks, subnets, or hosts. 
I 
protocol indicates which IP packet types to encrypt. 
Note 
PIX Firewall version 5.0 supports the IP protocol only. PIX Firewall version 5.1 
supports greater protocol and port granularity. 

7-24 
Cisco Secure PIX Firewall Advanced 1.01 
Copyright  2000, Cisco Systems, Inc. 
 
Crypto access lists are traffic selection access lists. They are used to define which 
IP traffic is interesting and will be protected by IPSec, and which traffic will not 
be protected by IPSec. Crypto access lists perform the following functions: 
I 
Indicate the data flow to be protected by IPSec 
I 
Select outbound traffic to be protected by IPSec 
I 
Process inbound traffic in order to filter out and discard traffic that should be 
protected by IPSec 
I 
Determine whether or not to accept requests for IPSec security associations 
for the requested data flows when processing IKE negotiations 
Note 
Although the access list syntax is unchanged from access lists applied to PIX 
Firewall interfaces, the meanings are slightly different for crypto access lists—
permit specifies that matching packets must be encrypted while deny specifies 
that matching packets need not be encrypted. 
Any unprotected inbound traffic that matches a permit entry in the crypto access 
list for a crypto map entry, flagged as IPSec, will be dropped, since this traffic 
was expected to be protected by IPSec. 
If you want certain traffic to receive one combination of IPSec protection (for 
example, authentication only) and other traffic to receive a different combination 
of IPSec protection (for example, both authentication and encryption), you must 
create two different crypto access lists to define the two different types of traffic. 
These different access lists are then used in different crypto map entries which 
specify different IPSec policies. 
In a later configuration step, you will associate the crypto access lists to particular 
interfaces when you configure and apply crypto map sets to the interfaces.  
WARNING Cisco recommends that you avoid using the any keyword to specify source 
or destination addresses. The permit any any statement is strongly discouraged, as this 
will cause all outbound traffic to be protected (and all protected traffic sent to the peer, 
specified in the corresponding crypto map entry), and will require protection for all inbound 
traffic. Then, all inbound packets that lack IPSec protection will be silently dropped, 
including packets for routing protocols, NTP, echo, echo response, and so on.  
Try to be as restrictive as possible when defining which packets to protect in a 
crypto access list. If you must use the any keyword in a permit statement, you 
must preface that statement with a series of deny statements to filter out any 
traffic (that would otherwise fall within that permit statement) that you do not 
want protected.

Transforms define the IPSec security protocols and algorithms. Each transform 
represents an IPSec security protocol (ESP, AH, or both) plus the algorithm you 
want to use.  
You can specify multiple transform sets, and then specify one or more of these 
transform sets in a crypto map entry. The transform set defined in the crypto map 
entry will be used in the IPSec security association negotiation to protect the data 
flows specified by the access list of that crypto map entry. 
During the IPSec security association negotiation, the peers agree to use a 
particular transform set for protecting a particular data flow. 
A transform set equals an AH transform and an ESP transform plus the mode 
(transport or tunnel.)

The PIX Firewall supports the transform sets listed in the figure. 
Choosing IPSec transforms combinations can be complex. The following tips may 
help you select transforms that are appropriate for your situation.  
If you want to provide data confidentiality, include an ESP encryption transform.  
Also consider including an ESP authentication transform or an AH transform to 
provide authentication services for the transform set: 
I 
Ensure data authentication for the outer IP header as well as the data, include 
an AH transform. 
I 
Ensure data authentication (using either ESP or AH), you can choose from the 
MD5 or SHA (HMAC keyed hash variants) authentication algorithms.  
The SHA algorithm is generally considered stronger than MD5, but it is slower.  
Examples of acceptable transform combinations are as follows: 
I 
esp-des for high performance encryption  
I 
ah-md5-hmac for authenticating packet contents with no encryption 
I 
esp-3des and esp-md5-hmac for strong encryption and authentication 
I 
ah-sha-hmac and esp-3des and esp-sha-hmac for strong encryption and 
authentication

Step 3 
Configure the crypto map with the crypto map command. 
(a) Create a crypto map entry in IPSec ISAKMP mode: 
pixfirewall(config)# crypto map map-name seq-num ipsec-isakmp 
I 
This identifies the crypto map with a unique crypto map name and sequence 
number. 
(b) Assign an access list to the crypto map entry: 
pixfirewall(config)# crypto map map-name seq-num match address access-list-name 
(c) Specify the peer to which the IPSec protected traffic can be forwarded: 
pixfirewall(config)# crypto map map-name seq-num set peer hostname | ip-address 
I 
Set the peer hostname or IP address.  
I 
Specify multiple peers by repeating this command. 
(d) Specify which transform sets are allowed for this crypto map entry. 
pixfirewall(config)# crypto map map-name seq-num set transform-set  
transform-set-name1 [transform-set-name2, transform-set-name9] 
I 
List multiple transform sets in order of priority (highest priority first). 
I 
You can specify up to nine (9) transform sets. 
(e) (Optional) Specify whether IPSec should ask for perfect forward secrecy 
(PFS) when requesting new security associations for this crypto map entry, or 
should require PFS in requests received from the peer: 
pixfirewall(config)# crypto map map-name seq-num set pfs [group1 | group2] 
Note 
PFS p rovides additional security for Diffie-Hellman key exchanges at a cost of 
additional processing.

(f) (Optional) Specify the security association lifetime for the crypto map entry if 
you want the security associations for this entry to be negotiated using different 
IPSec security association lifetimes other than the global lifetimes: 
pixfirewall(config)# crypto map map-name seq-num set security-association  
 lifetime seconds seconds | kilobytes kilobytes 
(g) (Optional) Specify dynamic crypto maps with the crypto dynamic-map 
dynamic-map-name dynamic-seq-num command. A dynamic crypto map entry 
is essentially a crypto map entry without all the parameters configured. It acts as a 
policy template where the missing parameters are later dynamically configured (as 
the result of an IPSec negotiation) to match a peer’s requirements. This allows 
peers to exchange IPSec traffic with the PIX Firewall even if the PIX Firewall 
does not have a crypto map entry specifically configured to meet all the peer’s 
requirements.

Scale PIX Firewall VPNs 
The use of pre-shared keys for IKE authentication only works when you have a 
few IPSec peers. Certificate Authorities enable scaling to a large number of IPSec 
peers.

CA Server Fulfilling Requests
from IPSec Peers
Each IPSec peer individually enrolls with the CA server.
CA Server
 
Using a CA server is the most scalable solution.  Other IKE authentication 
methods require manual intervention to generate and distribute the keys on a per-
peer basis. The CA server enrollment process can be largely automated so that it 
scales well to large deployments. Each IPSec peer individually enrolls with the 
CA server and obtains public and private encryption keys compatible with other 
peers enrolled with the server.

• Configure CA support.
• Generate public or private keys.
• Authenticate the CA.
• Request signed certificates from the CA.
• CA administrator verifies request and sends
signed certificates.
CA server
 
Peers enroll with a CA server in a series of steps in which specific keys are 
generated and then exchanged by the PIX Firewall and the CA server to 
ultimately form a signed certificate. The enrollment steps can be summarized as 
follows: 
Step 1 
The PIX Firewall generates an RSA key pair. 
Step 2 
The PIX Firewall obtains a public key and its certificate from the CA server. 
Step 3 
The PIX Firewall requests signed certificate from the CA using the generated RSA 
keys and the public key/certificate from the CA server. 
Step 4 
The CA administrator verifies the request and sends a signed certificate. 
Note 
See the “About CA” and “Configuring CA” sections in the “Configuring IPSec” 
chapter of the Configuration Guide for the Cisco Secure PIX Firewall for more 
details on how CA servers work and how to configure the PIX Firewall for CA 
support.

Setup 
Before starting this lab, set up your equipment as follows: 
I 
Ensure your Windows NT server is turned on 
I 
Access the PIX Firewall console port. You may wish to save the PIX 
Firewall configuration to a text file for later analysis. 
I 
Make sure the PIX Firewall is turned on. 
I 
Ensure you can ping from your internal Windows NT server to the opposite 
pod group’s Windows NT server. 
I 
Ensure the Web server is running on your own internal Windows NT server. 
I 
Ensure you can establish a Web connection from a Web browser on your 
internal Windows NT server to the opposite pod group’s Windows NT 
server. 
Directions 
Your task in this exercise is to configure the PIX Firewall to enable IPSec 
encrypted tunnels to another PIX Firewall. Work with your lab partner to perform 
the following steps in this lab: 
I 
Prepare to configure VPN support. 
I 
Configure IKE parameters. 
I 
Configure IPSec parameters. 
I 
Test and verify IPSec configuration. 
Task 1: Prepare to Configure VPN Support 
Perform the following lab steps to prepare for the IKE and IPSec configuration. 
Step 1 
Determine the IKE and IPSec policy. In this exercise, you will use default values 
except when you are directed to enter a specific value. 
I 
IKE policy is to use pre-shared keys. 
I 
IPSec policy is to use ESP mode with DES encryption. 
Step 2 
Verify that a static translation is configured from a global IP address on the 
outside interface to the internal Windows NT server: 
pixP(config)# show static 
static (inside,outside) 192.168.P.10 10.0.P.3 netmask 255.255.255.255 0 0 
(where P = pod number) 

Copyright  2000, Cisco Systems, Inc. 
VPN Configuration with the Cisco Secure PIX Firewall 
7-39 
Step 3 
Verify a conduit permitting Web access to your internal Windows NT server has 
been configured. 
pixP(config)# show conduit 
conduit permit tcp host 192.168.P.10 eq www any 
(where P = pod number) 
Step 4 
Ensure you can establish a Web connection between pods from the Windows NT 
server using the static and conduit. 
Step 5 
Enable the PIX Firewall to implicitly permit any packet from an IPSec tunnel and 
bypass the checking with an associated conduit or access-group command for 
IPSec connections. 
pixP(config)# sysopt connection permit-ipsec 
Task 2: Configure IKE Parameters 
Perform the following steps to configure IKE on your PIX Firewall: 
Step 1 Ensure IKE is enabled on the outside interface: 
pixP(config)# isakmp enable outside 
Step 2 
Configure a basic IKE policy using pre-shared keys for authentication. 
pixP(config)# isakmp policy 10 authentication pre-share 
Step 3 
Set the IKE identity. 
pixP(config)# isakmp identity address 
Step 4 
Configure the ISAKMP pre-shared key to point to the outside IP address of the 
peer PIX Firewall. 
pixP(config)# isakmp key cisco123 address 192.168.Q.2 netmask 255.255.255.255 
(where P = pod number, and Q = peer pod number) 
Task 3: Configure IPSec Parameters 
Perform the following steps to configure IPSec (IKE Phase two) parameters: 
Step 1 
Create an access list to select traffic to protect. The access list should protect IP 
traffic between Windows NT servers on the peer PIX Firewalls:  
pixP(config)# access-list 101 permit ip host 192.168.P.10 host 192.168.Q.10 
(where P = pod number, and Q = peer pod number) 
Consider the example access list for PIX1 peering to PIX2: 
pix1(config)# show access-list  
access-list 101 permit ip host 192.168.1.10 host 192.168.2.10 
Step 2 
Configure an IPSec transform set (IKE phase two parameters) to use ESP and 
DES. Use a transform-set-name of pixQ, where “Q” equals your peer’s pod 
number: 
pixP(config)# crypto ipsec transform-set pixQ esp-des 

7-40 
Cisco Secure PIX Firewall Advanced 1.01

Step 3 
Create a crypto map by performing the following sub-steps: 
1. Create a crypto map entry. Use a map-name of peerQ: 
pixP(config)# crypto map peerQ 10 ipsec-isakmp 
(where Q = peer pod number) 
2. Look at the crypto map and observe the defaults: 
pixP(config)# show crypto map 
Crypto Map “peerQ” 10 ipsec-isakmp 
        No matching address list set. 
        Current peer: 0.0.0.0 
        Security association lifetime: 4608000 kilobytes/28800 seconds 
        PFS (Y/N): N 
        Transform sets={ } 
What is the default security association lifetime? 
A: 4608000 kilobytes/28800 seconds 
3. Assign the access list to the crypto map. 
pixP(config)# crypto map peerQ 10 match address 101 
(where Q = peer pod number) 
4. Define the peer. The peer IP address should be set to the peer’s outside 
interface IP address: 
pixP(config)# crypto map peerQ 10 set peer 192.168.Q.2 
(where Q = peer pod number) 
5. Specify the transform set used to reach the peer. Use the transform set name 
you configured in sub-step 2. 
pixP(config)# crypto map peerQ 10 set transform-set pixQ 
(where Q = peer pod number) 
6. Apply the crypto map set to the outside interface: 
pixP(config)# crypto map peerQ interface outside 
(where Q = peer pod number) 
Task 4: Test and Verify IPSec Configuration 
Perform the following steps to test and verify VPN configuration: 
Step 1 
Verify the IKE policy you just created. Note the default values. 
pixP(config)# show isakmp 
isakmp enable outside 
isakmp key cisco123 address 192.168.Q.2 netmask 255.255.255.255 
isakmp policy 10 authentication pre-share

Introduction to The Cisco IOS Firewall
This section introduces the features of The Cisco IOS™ (IOS) Firewall.
© 2000, Cisco Systems, Inc. 
www.cisco.co
CSPFA 1.01—8-4
The Cisco IOS
The Cisco IOS
• The Cisco IOS™ Firewall is a suite of
features for Cisco IOS routers that provide
network protection on multiple levels using
the following:
–Context-Based Access Control (firewall)
–Authentication proxy
–Intrusion detection
The Cisco IOS Firewall is a security-specific option for Cisco IOS software. It 
integrates robust firewall functionality, authentication proxy, and intrusion 
detection for every network perimeter, and enriches existing Cisco IOS security 
capabilities. It adds greater depth and flexibility to existing Cisco IOS security 
solutions, such as authentication, encryption, and failover, by delivering state-of-
the-art security features such as stateful, application-based filtering; dynamic per-
user authentication and authorization; defense against network attacks; Java 
blocking; and real-time alerts. When combined with Cisco IOS IPSec software 
and other Cisco IOS software-based technologies, such as Layer 2 Tunneling 
Protocol (L2TP) tunneling and quality of service (QoS), the Cisco IOS Firewall 
provides a complete, integrated virtual private network (VPN) solution.
Context-Based Access Control 
The Cisco IOS Firewall Context-Based Access Control (CBAC) engine provides 
secure, per-application access control across network perimeters. CBAC enhances 
security for TCP and UDP applications that use well-known ports, such as FTP 
and e-mail traffic, by scrutinizing source and destination addresses. CBAC allows 
network administrators to implement firewall intelligence as part of an integrated, 
single-box solution.
For example, sessions with an extranet partner involving Internet applications, 
multimedia applications, or Oracle databases would no longer need to open a 

8-4

network doorway accessible via weaknesses in a partner’s network. CBAC lets 
tightly secured networks run today’s basic application traffic, as well as advanced 
applications such as multimedia and videoconferencing, securely through a router.
Authentication Proxy
Network administrators can create specific security policies for each user with 
Cisco IOS Firewall LAN-based, dynamic, per-user authentication and 
authorization. Previously, user identity and related authorized access were 
determined by a user’s fixed IP address, or a single security policy had to be 
applied to an entire user group or subnet. Now, per-user policy can be 
downloaded dynamically to the router from a TACACS+ or RADIUS 
authentication server using Cisco IOS software authentication, authorization, and 
accounting (AAA) services. 
Users can log into the network or access the Internet via HTTP, and their specific 
access profiles will automatically be downloaded. Appropriate dynamic individual 
access privileges are available as required, protecting the network against more 
general policies applied across multiple users. Authentication and authorization 
can be applied to the router interface in either direction to secure inbound or 
outbound extranet, intranet, and Internet usage.
Intrusion Detection 
Intrusion detection systems (IDS) provide a level of protection beyond the 
firewall by protecting the network from internal and external attacks and threats. 
Cisco IOS Firewall IDS technology enhances perimeter firewall protection by 
taking appropriate action on packets and flows that violate the security policy or 
represent malicious network activity. 
Cisco IOS Firewall intrusion detection capabilities are ideal for providing 
additional visibility at intranet, extranet, and branch-office Internet perimeters. 
Network administrators now enjoy more robust protection against attacks on the 
network, and can automatically respond to threats from internal or external hosts.

Context-Based Access
Control
• Packets are inspected entering the firewall by CBAC
if not specifically denied by an ACL
• CBAC permits or denies specified TCP and UDP
traffic through a firewall
• A state table is maintained with session information
• ACLs are dynamically created or deleted
• CBAC protects against DoS attacks
CBAC intelligently filters TCP and UDP packets based on application-layer 
protocol session information. It can inspect traffic for sessions that originate on 
any interface of the router. CBAC inspects traffic that travels through the firewall 
to discover and manage state information for TCP and UDP sessions. This state 
information is used to create temporary openings in the firewall’s access lists to 
allow return traffic and additional data connections for permissible sessions. 
Inspecting packets at the application layer, and maintaining TCP and UDP session 
information, provides CBAC with the ability to detect and prevent certain types of 
network attacks such as SYN flooding. CBAC also inspects packet sequence 
numbers in TCP connections to see if they are within expected ranges—CBAC 
drops any suspicious packets. Additionally, CBAC can detect unusually high rates 
of new connections and issue alert messages. CBAC inspection can help protect 
against certain Denial of Service (DoS) attacks involving fragmented IP packets. 
Even though the firewall prevents an attacker from making actual connections to a 
given host, the attacker can disrupt services provided by that host. This is done by 
sending many non-initial IP fragments or by sending complete fragmented packets 
through a router with an access control list (ACL) that filters the first fragment of 
a fragmented packet. These fragments can tie up resources on the target host as it 
tries to reassemble the incomplete packets.

Authentication Proxy
Authentication Proxy
• HTTP-based authentication
• Provides dynamic, per-user authentication
and authorization via TACACS+ and
RADIUS protocols
The Cisco IOS Firewall authentication proxy feature allows network 
administrators to apply specific security policies on a per-user basis. Previously, 
user identity and related authorized access was associated with a user’s IP 
address, or a single security policy had to be applied to an entire user group or 
subnet. Now, users can be identified and authorized on the basis of their per-user 
policy, and access privileges tailored on an individual basis are possible, as 
opposed to general policy applied across multiple users. 
With the authentication proxy feature, users can log in to the network or access 
the Internet via HTTP, and their specific access profiles are automatically 
retrieved and applied from a Cisco Secure Asynchronous Communications Server 
(ACS), or other RADIUS or TACACS+ authentication server. The user profiles 
are active only when there is active traffic from the authenticated users.
The authentication proxy is compatible with other Cisco IOS security features 
such as Network Address Translation (NATCBAC, IP Security (IPSec) 
encryption, and VPN client software.

Intrusion Detection
Intrusion Detection
• Acts as an in-line intrusion detection sensor
• When a packet or packets match a signature, it can perform
any of the following configurable actions:
– Alarm: Send an alarm to an IDS Director or Syslog server
– Drop: Drop the packet
– Reset: Send TCP resets to terminate the session
• Identifies 59 common attacks
TCP
UDP
The Cisco IOS Firewall now offers intrusion detection technology for mid-range 
and high-end router platforms with firewall support. It is ideal for any network 
perimeter, and especially for locations in which a router is being deployed and 
additional security between network segments is required. It also can protect 
intranet and extranet connections where additional security is mandated, and 
branch-office sites connecting to the corporate office or Internet.
The Cisco IOS Firewall’s intrusion detection system identifies 59 common attacks 
using signatures to detect patterns of misuse in network traffic. The intrusion 
detection signatures available in the new release of the Cisco IOS Firewall were 
chosen from a broad cross-section of intrusion detection signatures. The 
signatures represent severe breaches of security and the most common network 
attacks and information-gathering scans.

• Provide traffic filtering by
–Source and destination IP addresses
–Source and destination ports
• Can be used to implement a filtering
firewall
–Ports are opened permanently to allow
traffic creating a security vulnerability
–Do not work with applications that
negotiate ports dynamically
Before delving into CBAC, some basic ACL concepts need to be covered briefly. 
An ACL provides packet filtering: it has an implied deny all at the end of the 
ACL and if the ACL is not configured, it permits all connections. Without CBAC, 
traffic filtering is limited to access list implementations that examine packets at 
the network layer, or at most, the transport layer.

4 CBAC detects when an
application terminates or
times out and removes all
dynamic ACLs for that
session.
3 CBAC continues to inspect control
traffic and dynamically creates and
removes ACLs as required by the
application. It also monitors and
protects against application-
specific attacks.
With CBAC, you specify which protocols you want to be inspected, and you 
specify an interface and interface direction (in or out) where inspection originates. 
Only specified protocols will be inspected by CBAC. For these protocols, packets 
flowing through the firewall in any direction are inspected, as long as they flow 
through the interface where inspection is configured. Packets entering the firewall 
are inspected by CBAC only if they first pass the inbound access list at the 
interface. If a packet is denied by the ACL, the packet is simply dropped and not 
inspected by CBAC.
CBAC inspects and monitors only the control channels of connections; the data 
channels are not inspected. For example, during FTP sessions both the control and 
data channels (which are created when a data file is transferred) are monitored for 
state changes, but only the control channel is inspected (that is, the CBAC 
software parses the FTP commands and responses).
CBAC inspection recognizes application-specific commands in the control 
channel, and detects and prevents certain application-level attacks. CBAC 
inspection tracks sequence numbers in all TCP packets, and drops those packets 
with sequence numbers that are not within expected ranges. CBAC inspection 
recognizes application-specific commands (such as illegal Simple Mail Transfer 
Protocol [SMTP] commands) in the control channel, and detects and prevents 
certain application-level attacks. When CBAC suspects an attack, the DoS feature 
can take several actions:
I
Generate alert messages
I
Protect system resources that could impede performance
I
Block packets from suspected attackers
CBAC uses timeout and threshold values to manage session state information, 
helping to determine when to drop sessions that do not become fully established. 

8-10
Cisco Secure PIX Firewall Advanced 1.0
Copyright  2000, Cisco Systems, Inc.
Setting timeout values for network sessions helps prevent DoS attacks by freeing 
up system resources, dropping sessions after a specified amount of time. Setting 
threshold values for network sessions helps prevent DoS attacks by controlling the 
number of half-open sessions, which limits the amount of system resources 
applied to half-open sessions. When a session is dropped, CBAC sends a reset 
message to the devices at both endpoints (source and destination) of the session. 
When the system under DoS attack receives a reset command, it releases, or frees 
up, processes and resources related to that incomplete session. 
CBAC provides three thresholds against DoS attacks:
I
The total number of half-open TCP or UDP sessions 
I
The number of half-open sessions based on time
I
The number of half-open TCP-only sessions per host
If a threshold is exceeded, CBAC has two options: 
I
Send a reset message to the endpoints of the oldest half-open session, making 
resources available to service newly arriving SYN packets. 
I
In the case of half-open TCP-only sessions, CBAC blocks all SYN packets 
temporarily for the duration configured by the threshold value. When the 
router blocks a SYN packet, the TCP three-way handshake is never initiated, 
which prevents the router from using memory and processing resources 
needed for valid connections.
DoS detection and prevention requires that you create a CBAC inspection rule 
and apply that rule on an interface. The inspection rule must include the protocols 
that you want to monitor against DoS attacks. For example, if you have TCP 
inspection enabled on the inspection rule, then CBAC can track all TCP 
connections to watch for DoS attacks. If the inspection rule includes FTP protocol 
inspection but not TCP inspection, CBAC tracks only FTP connections for DoS 
attacks.
A state table maintains session state information. Whenever a packet is inspected, 
a state table is updated to include information about the state of the packet's 
connection. Return traffic will only be permitted back through the firewall if the 
state table contains information indicating that the packet belongs to a permissible 
session. Inspection controls the traffic that belongs to a valid session and forwards 
the traffic it does not know. When return traffic is inspected, the state table 
information is updated as necessary.
UDP sessions are approximated. With UDP there are no actual sessions, so the 
software approximates sessions by examining the information in the packet and 
determining if the packet is similar to other UDP packets (for example, similar 
source or destination addresses and port numbers), and if the packet was detected 
soon after another, similar UDP packet. Soon means within the configurable UDP 
idle timeout period.
Access list entries are dynamically created and deleted. CBAC dynamically 
creates and deletes access list entries at the firewall interfaces, according to the 
information maintained in the state tables. These access list entries are applied to 
the interfaces to examine traffic flowing back into the internal network. These 
entries create temporary openings in the firewall to permit only traffic that is part 
of a permissible session. The temporary access list entries are never saved to 
nonvolatile RAM (NVRAM.)

Alerts and Audit Trails
Alerts and Audit Trails
• CBAC generates real-time alerts and audit
trails.
• Audit trail features use Syslog to track all
network transactions.
• With CBAC inspection rules, you can
configure alerts and audit trail information
on a per-application protocol basis.
CBAC also generates real-time alerts and audit trails based on events tracked by 
the firewall. Enhanced audit trail features use Syslog to track all network 
transactions; recording time stamps, source host, destination host, ports used, and 
the total number of transmitted bytes, for advanced, session-based reporting.
Real-time alerts send Syslog error messages to central management consoles upon 
detecting suspicious activity. Using CBAC inspection rules, you can configure 
alerts and audit trail information on a per-application protocol basis. For example, 
if you want to generate audit trail information for HTTP traffic, you can specify 
that in the CBAC rule covering HTTP inspection.

CBAC uses timeouts and thresholds to determine how long to manage state 
information for a session, and to determine when to drop sessions that do not 
become fully established. These timeouts and thresholds apply globally to all 
sessions.
You can use the default timeout and threshold values, or you can change to values 
more suitable to your security requirements. You should make any changes to the 
timeout and threshold values before you continue configuring CBAC.
To define how long the software will wait for a TCP session to reach the 
established state before dropping the session, use the ip inspect tcp synwait-time
global configuration command. Use the no form of this command to reset the 
timeout to the default.

An unusually high number of half-open sessions (either absolute or measured as 
the arrival rate) could indicate that a DoS attack is occurring. For TCP, half-open 
means that the session has not reached the established state—the TCP three-way 
handshake has not yet been completed. For UDP, half-open means that the 
firewall has detected no return traffic.
CBAC measures both the total number of existing half-open sessions and the rate 
of session establishment attempts. Both TCP and UDP half-open sessions are 
counted in the total number and rate measurements. Measurements are made once 
a minute.
When the number of existing half-open sessions rises above a threshold (the max-
incomplete high number), CBAC will go in to “aggressive mode” and delete 
half-open sessions as required to accommodate new connection requests. The 
software continues to delete half-open requests as necessary, until the number of 
existing half-open sessions drops below another threshold (the max-incomplete 
low number).
To define the number of existing half-open sessions that will cause the software to 
start deleting half-open sessions, use the ip inspect max-incomplete high 
command in global configuration mode. Use the no form of this command to reset 
the threshold to default.

When the rate of new connection attempts rises above a threshold (the one-
minute high number), the software will delete half-open sessions as required to 
accommodate new connection attempts. The software continues to delete half-
open sessions as necessary, until the rate of new connection attempts drops below 
another threshold (the one-minute low number). The rate thresholds are 
measured as the number of new session connection attempts detected in the last 
one-minute sample period. The firewall router reviews the one-minute rate on an 
ongoing basis, meaning that the router reviews the rate more frequently than one 
minute and does not keep deleting half-open sessions for one-minute after a DoS 
attack has stopped—it will be less time.
To define the rate of new unestablished sessions that will cause the software to 
start deleting half-open sessions, use the ip inspect one-minute high command in

• Defines the number of half-open TCP sessions with the same
host destination address that can exist at a time before CSIS
starts deleting half-open sessions to the host
• After the number of half-open connections is exceeded to a
given host, the software deletes half-open sessions on that
host in the following fashion:
– If block-time is 0, the oldest half-open session is deleted,
per new connection request, to let new connections
through
– If block-time is greater than 0, all half-open sessions are
deleted, and new connections to the host are not allowed
during the specified block time

Router(config)# 
An unusually high number of half-open sessions with the same destination host 
address could indicate that a DoS attack is being launched against the host. 
Whenever the number of half-open sessions with the same destination host 
address rises above a threshold (the max-incomplete host number), the software 
will delete half-open sessions according to one of the following methods:
I
If the block-time seconds timeout is 0 (the default)—The software deletes 
the oldest existing half-open session for the host for every new connection 
request to the host. This ensures that the number of half-open sessions to a 
given host will never exceed the threshold.
I
If the block-time seconds timeout is greater than 0—The software deletes all 
existing half-open sessions for the host, and then blocks all new connection 
requests to the host. The software will continue to block all new connection 
requests until the block time expires.
The software also sends Syslog messages whenever the max-incomplete host 
number is exceeded, and when blocking of connection initiations to a host starts 
or ends.
The global values specified for the threshold and blocking time apply to all TCP 
connections inspected by CBAC.
Use the ip inspect tcp max-incomplete host global configuration command to 
specify threshold and blocking time values for TCP host-specific DoS detection 
and prevention. Use the no form of this command to reset the threshold and 
blocking time to the default values.

Port-to-Application Mapping
This section discusses the configuration of port numbers for application protocols.
© 2000, Cisco Systems, Inc. 
www.cisco.co
CSPFA 1.01—8-23
Port-to-Application Mapping
(PAM)
Port-to-Application Mapping
(PAM)
• Ability to configure any port number
for an application protocol
• CBAC uses PAM to determine the
application configured for a port
Port-to-Application Mapping (PAM) allows you to customize TCP or UDP port 
numbers for network services or applications. PAM uses this information to 
support network environments that run services using ports that are different from 
the registered or well-known ports associated with an application.
Using the port information, PAM establishes a table of default port-to-application 
mapping information at the firewall. The information in the PAM table enables 
CBAC supported services to run on nonstandard ports. Previously, CBAC was 
limited to inspecting traffic using only the well-known or registered ports 
associated with an application. Now, PAM allows network administrators to 
customize network access control for specific applications and services.
PAM also supports host or subnet-specific port mapping, which allows you to 
apply PAM to a single host or subnet using standard ACLs. Host- or subnet-
specific port mapping is done using standard ACLs.
System-Defined Port Mapping
PAM creates a table, or database, of system-defined mapping entries using the 
well-known or registered port mapping information set up during the system 
startup. The system-defined entries comprise all the services supported by CBAC, 
which requires the system-defined mapping information to function properly.

Note
The system-defined mapping information cannot be deleted or changed; that is, 
you cannot map HTTP services to port 21 (FTP) or FTP services to port 80 
(HTTP).
The following lists the default system-defined services and applications in the 
PAM table.

User-Defined Port Mapping
User-Defined Port Mapping
Router(config)# 
Router(config)# 
Router(config)# 
Network services or applications that use nonstandard ports require user-defined 
entries in the PAM table. For example, your network might run HTTP services on 
the nonstandard port 8000 instead of on the system-defined default port 80. In this 
case, you can use PAM to map port 8000 with HTTP services. If HTTP services 
run on other ports, use PAM to create additional port mapping entries. After you 
define a port mapping, you can overwrite that entry at a later time by simply 
mapping that specific port with a different application. 
Note
If you try to map an application to a system-defined port, a message appears 
warning you of a mapping conflict. 
User-defined port mapping information can also specify a range of ports for an 
application by establishing a separate entry in the PAM table for each port 
number in the range.
User-defined entries are saved with the default mapping information when you 
save the router configuration. 
To establish PAM, use the ip port-map configuration command. Use the no form 
of this command to delete user-defined PAM entries.
The syntax for the ip port-map command is as follows:
ip port-map appl_name port port_num [list acl_num] 
Arguments
Description
appl_name
Specifies the name of the application with which to apply the port 
mapping. Use one of the following application names: cuseeme, dns, 
exec, finger, ftp, gopher, http, h323, imap, kerberos, ldap, login, 
lotusnote, mgcp, msrpc, ms-sql, netshow, nfs, nntp, pop2, pop3,

sunrpc, sybase-sql, tacacs, telnet, tftp, or vdolive
port port_num
Identifies a port number in the range 1 to 65535.
list acl_num
Identifies the standard ACL number used with PAM for host- or 
network-specific port mapping.
Host- or Network-Specific Port Mapping
User-defined entries in the mapping table can include host- or network-specific 
mapping information, which establishes port mapping information for specific 
hosts or subnets. In some environments, it might be necessary to override the 
default port mapping information for a specific host or subnet.
With host-specific port mapping, you can use the same port number for different 
services on different hosts. This means that you can map port 8000 with HTTP 
services for one host, while mapping port 8000 with Telnet services for another 
host.
Host-specific port mapping also allows you to apply PAM to a specific subnet 
when that subnet runs a service that uses a port number that is different from the 
port number defined in the default mapping information. For example, hosts on 
subnet 192.168.0.0 might run HTTP services on nonstandard port 8000, while 
other traffic through the firewall uses the default port 80 for HTTP services.
Host- or network-specific port mapping allows you to override a system-defined 
entry in the PAM table. For example, if CBAC finds an entry in the PAM table 
that maps port 25 (the system-defined port for SMTP) with HTTP for a specific 
host, CBAC identifies port 25 as HTTP protocol traffic on that host.
Note
If the host-specific port mapping information is the same as existing system- or 
user-defined default entries, host-specific port changes have no effect. 
Use the list option for the ip port-map command to specify an ACL for a host or 
subnet that uses PAM.

Inspection rules must be defined to specify what IP traffic (which application-
layer protocols) will be inspected by CBAC at an interface. Normally, you define 
only one inspection rule. The only exception might occur if you want to enable 
CBAC in two directions at a single firewall interface. In this case you must 
configure two rules, one for each direction.
An inspection rule should specify each desired application-layer protocol, as well 
as generic TCP or generic UDP, if desired. The inspection rule consists of a series 
of statements, each listing a protocol and specifying the same inspection rule 
name.
Inspection rules include options for controlling alert and audit trail messages and 
for checking IP packet fragmentation.
To define a set of inspection rules, use the ip inspect name command in global 
configuration mode. Use the no form of this command to remove the inspection 
rule for a protocol or to remove the entire set of inspection rules.
The syntax for the ip inspect name command is as follows:
ip inspect name inspection-name protocol [alert {on | off}] [audit-trail {on | off}] [timeout

Java inspection enables Java applet filtering at the firewall. Java applet filtering 
distinguishes between trusted and untrusted applets by relying on a list of external 
sites that you designate as friendly. If an applet is from a friendly site, the firewall 
allows the applet through. If the applet is not from a friendly site, the applet will 
be blocked. Alternately, you could permit applets from all sites except for sites 
specifically designated as hostile.
Note
If you do not configure an access list, but use a "placeholder" access list in the ip 
inspect name inspection-name http command, all Java applets will be blocked.
Note
CBAC does not detect or block encapsulated Java applets. Therefore, Java 
applets that are wrapped or encapsulated, such as applets in .zip or .jar format, are 
not blocked at the firewall. CBAC also does not detect or block applets loaded via 
FTP, gopher, or HTTP on a nonstandard port.
The syntax for the ip inspect name command for Java applet filtering inspection 
is as follows:

Router(config)# 
CBAC inspection rules can help protect hosts against certain DoS attacks 
involving fragmented IP packets. Even though the firewall keeps an attacker from 
making actual connections to a given host, the attacker may still be able to disrupt 
services provided by that host. This is done by sending many noninitial IP 
fragments, or by sending complete fragmented packets through a router with an 
ACL that filters the first fragment of a fragmented packet. These fragments can tie 
up resources on the target host as it tries to reassemble the incomplete packets.
Using fragmentation inspection, the firewall maintains an interfragment state 
(structure) for IP traffic. Noninitial fragments are discarded unless the 
corresponding initial fragment was permitted to pass through the firewall. 
Noninitial fragments received before the corresponding initial fragments are 
discarded. 
Note
Fragmentation inspection can have undesirable effects in certain cases, because it 
can result in the firewall discarding any packet whose fragments arrive out of order. 
There are many circumstances that can cause out-of-order delivery of legitimate 
fragments. Apply fragmentation inspection in situations where legitimate fragments, 
which are likely to arrive out of order, might have a severe performance impact.
Because routers running Cisco IOS software are used in a very large variety of 
networks, and because the CBAC feature is often used to isolate parts of internal 
networks from one another, the fragmentation inspection feature is not enabled by 
default. Fragmentation detection must be explicitly enabled for an inspection rule 
using the ip inspect name (global) command. Unfragmented traffic is never 
discarded because it lacks a fragment state. Even when the system is under heavy 
attack with fragmented packets, legitimate fragmented traffic, if any, will still get 
some fraction of the firewall's fragment state resources, and legitimate, 
unfragmented traffic can flow through the firewall unimpeded.

The syntax of the ip inspect name command for IP packet fragmentation is as 
follows:
ip inspect name inspection-name fragment max  number timeout seconds
no ip inspect name inspection-name fragment
Arguments
Description
inspection-name
Names the set of inspection rules. If you want to add a protocol 
to an existing set of rules, use the same inspection-name as the 
existing set of rules.
fragment 
Specifies fragment inspection for the named rule.
max number
Specifies the maximum number of unassembled packets for 
which state information (structures) is allocated by the software. 
Unassembled packets are packets that arrive at the router 
interface before the initial packet for a session. The acceptable 
range is 50 through 10000. The default is 256 state entries.
Memory is allocated for the state structures, and setting this 
value to a larger number may cause memory resources to be 
exhausted.
timeout seconds
Configures the number of seconds that a packet state structure 
remains active. When the timeout value expires, the router drops 
the unassembled packet, freeing that structure for use by another 
packet. The default timeout value is one second.
If this number is set to a value greater than one second, it will be 
automatically adjusted by the software when the number of free 
state structures goes below certain thresholds: when the number 
of free states is less than 32, the timeout will be divided by 2. 
When the number of free states is less than 16, the timeout will 
be set to 1 second.

General Rules for Applying
Inspection Rules and ACLs
General Rules for Applying
Inspection Rules and ACLs
• Interface where traffic initiates
–Apply ACL on the inward direction that
only permits wanted traffic
–Apply rule on the inward direction that
inspects wanted traffic
• All other interfaces
–Apply ACL on the inward direction that
denies all traffic, except traffic (such as
ICMP) not inspected by CBAC
For the CISCO IOS Firewall to be effective, both inspection rules and ACLs must 
be strategically applied to all the router’s interfaces. The following is the general 
rule of thumb for applying inspection rules and ACLs on the router: 
I
On the interface where traffic initiates
–
Apply the ACL on the inward direction that only permits wanted traffic.
–
Apply the rule on the inward direction that inspects wanted traffic.
I
All other interfaces
–
Apply the ACL on the inward direction that denies all traffic, except 
traffic (such as ICMP) not inspected by CBAC.

As an example, configure the router to be a firewall between two networks: inside 
and outside. The security policy to implement is as follows: allow all general TCP 
and UDP traffic initiated on the inside (outbound) from network 10.0.0.0 to 
access the Internet. ICMP traffic will also be allowed from the same network. 
Other networks on the inside, which are not defined, must be denied. For traffic 
initiated on the outside (inbound), allow everyone to only access ICMP and HTTP 
to host 10.0.0.3. Any other traffic must be denied.

Introduction to the IOS Authorization 
Proxy
This section introduces the features of the IOS™ Firewall authorization proxy.

What Is the Authentication
Proxy
What Is the Authentication
Proxy
• HTTP-based authentication
• Provides dynamic, per-user authentication and
authorization via TACACS+ and RADIUS
protocols
• Valid for all types of application traffic
• Works on any interface type for inbound or
outbound traffic
• AAA accounting is not supported
The Cisco IOS Firewall authentication proxy feature allows network 
administrators to apply specific security policies on a per-user basis. Previously, 
user identity and related authorized access were associated with a user’s IP 
address, or a single security policy had to be applied to an entire user group or 
subnet. Now, users can be identified and authorized on the basis of their per-user 
policy, and access privileges can be tailored on an individual basis, as opposed to 
a general policy applied across multiple users. 
With the authentication proxy feature, users can log into the network or access the 
Internet via HTTP, and their specific access profiles are automatically retrieved 
and applied from a Cisco Secure Asynchronous Communication Server (ACS), or 
other RADIUS or TACACS+ authentication server. The user profiles are active 
only when there is active traffic from the authenticated users.
The authentication proxy is compatible with other Cisco IOS security features 
such as Network Address Translation (NAT), Context-Based Access Control
(CBAC), IP Security (IPSec) encryption, and VPN client software.

When a user initiates an HTTP session through the firewall, it triggers the 
authentication proxy. If a valid authentication entry exists for the user, the session 
is allowed and no further intervention is required by the authentication proxy. If 
no entry exists, the authentication proxy responds to the HTTP connection request 
by prompting the user for a username and password, as shown above.

When a user initiates an HTTP session through the firewall, it triggers the 
authentication proxy. The authentication proxy first checks to see if the user has 
been authenticated. If a valid authentication entry exists for the user, the session is 
allowed and no further intervention is required by the authentication proxy. If no 
entry exists, the authentication proxy responds to the HTTP connection request by 
prompting the user for a username and password. 
Users must successfully authenticate with the authentication server by entering a 
valid username and password. If the authentication succeeds, the user’s 
authorization profile is retrieved from the authentication, authorization, and 
accounting (AAA) server. The authentication proxy uses the information in the 
this profile to create dynamic access control entries (ACEs) and add them to the 
inbound (input) access control list (ACL) of an input interface, and to the 
outbound (output) ACL of an output interface if an output ACL exists at the 
interface. By doing this, the firewall allows authenticated users access to the 
network as permitted by the authorization profile. For example, a user can initiate 
a Telnet connection through the firewall if Telnet is permitted in the user’s 
profile. 
If the authentication fails, the authentication proxy reports the failure to the user, 
and prompts the user with multiple retries. If the user fails to authenticate after 
five attempts, the user must wait two minutes and initiate another HTTP session 
to trigger the authentication proxy.
The authentication proxy sets up an inactivity (idle) timer for each user profile. 
As long as there is activity through the firewall, new traffic initiated from the 
user’s host does not trigger the authentication proxy, and all authorized user 
traffic is permitted access through the firewall.
If the idle timer expires, the authentication proxy removes the user’s profile 
information and dynamic access list entries. When this happens, traffic from the 
client host is blocked. The user must initiate another HTTP connection to trigger 
the authentication proxy.

Apply the authentication proxy in the inward direction at any interface on the 
router where you want per-user authentication and authorization. Applying the 
authentication proxy inward at an interface causes it to intercept a user’s initial 
connection request before that request is subjected to any other processing by the 
firewall. If the user fails to authenticate with the AAA server, the connection 
request is dropped.
How you apply the authentication proxy depends on your security policy. For 
example, you can block all traffic through an interface, and enable the 
authentication proxy feature to require authentication and authorization for all 
user-initiated HTTP connections. Users are authorized for services only after 
successful authentication with the AAA server. The authentication proxy feature 
also allows you to use standard access lists to specify a host or group of hosts 
whose initial HTTP traffic triggers the proxy.

managed after a period of inactivity), use the ip auth-proxy auth-cache-time 
global configuration command. To set the default value, use the no form of this 
command. 
Note 
Set the auth-cache-time option for any authentication proxy rule to a higher value 
than the idle timeout value for any CBAC inspection rule. When the authentication 
proxy removes an authentication cache along with its associated dynamic user 
ACL, there might be some idle connections monitored by CBAC, and removal of 
user-specific ACLs could cause those idle connections to hang. If CBAC has a 
shorter idle timeout, CBAC resets these connections when the idle timeout expires; 
that is, before the authentication proxy removes the user profile.

Router(config)# access-list 10 permit 10.0.0.0
0.0.0.255
Router(config)# interface ethernet0
Router(config-if)# ip auth-proxy aprule
 
You can associate an authentication proxy rule with an access control list, 
providing control over which hosts use the authentication proxy. To create an 
authentication proxy rule with ACLs, use the ip auth-proxy name global 
configuration command with the list std-acl-num option. To remove the 
authentication proxy rules, use the no form of this command. 
The syntax of the ip auth-proxy name with ACLs command is as follows: 
ip auth-proxy name auth-proxy-name http list std-acl-num 
no ip auth-proxy name auth-proxy-name 
Arguments 
Description 
auth-proxy-name 
Associates a name with an authentication proxy rule. 
Enter a name of up to 16 alphanumeric characters. 
list std-acl-num 
Specifies a standard access list to use with the 
authentication proxy. With this option, the 
authentication proxy is applied only to those hosts in 
the standard access list. If no list is specified, all 
connections initiating HTTP traffic arriving at the 
interface are subject to authentication.
