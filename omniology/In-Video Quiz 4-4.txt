The Circulatory System
1. If blood ﬂow to an arm is obstructed for more than 30 seconds while taking a 
blood pressure, then release of the cuff will be followed by a temporary rise in 
blood ﬂow and a return to resting levels. The higher blood ﬂow is caused by 
___. 
 
 
A. an increase in total peripheral resistance (TPR).
 
 
B. a temporary increase in mean arterial pressure.
 
 
C. local vasodilation due to the build up of metabolites.
 
 
D. shifting blood ﬂow from other organs.  
2. In advanced atherosclerosis, calciﬁed plaques cause the normally muscular 
arteries to become narrow.  What happens to resistance in these vessels?  
 
A. Resistance increases
 
B. Resistance decreases
 
C. Resistance remains unchanged
3. If advanced atherosclerosis, calciﬁed plaques cause the normally muscular 
arteries to become narrow.
If cardiac output remains unchanged, what happens to MAP? 
 
A. MAP increases 
 
B. MAP decreases
 
C. MAP remains unchanged
4. If MAP increases in an eighty year old male, what happens to afterload? 
 
A. Afterload is increased
 
B. After load is decreased 
 
C. After load is unchanged? 

Answer 1: C. local vasodilation due to the build up of metabolites.
Answer 2: A. Resistance increases
Answer 3: A. MAP increases
Answer 4: A. Afterload is increased
