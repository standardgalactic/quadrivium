Photoshop Elements 7 All-in-One For Dummies
xxiv

Introduction
P
hotoshop Elements has evolved through several generations to
become a sophisticated photo editor. What was once a low-end, 
consumer-grade product is now a tool for novice photo editors, amateur
photographers, and professionals alike.
Elements shines on its own turf and is distinguished from Adobe Photoshop
in many ways. Not only a program for improving image quality, Elements is a
complex software application that offers you many different editing tools for
designing a variety of photo creations and sharing your photos in a number
of ways. Of course, it also gives you all the standard editing features you
need for, say, controlling image brightness or working with color correction.
Why should you buy Elements (and, ultimately, this book)? The range of
people who can benefit from using Elements is wide and includes a vast audi-
ence. Elements has something for everyone — from beginning image editors
to intermediate users to more advanced amateurs and professionals. We’ll
even stick our necks out a little and suggest that many Photoshop users can
benefit greatly by adding Elements to their software tool cabinets. Why?
Because Elements offers some wonderful creation and sharing tools that
Photoshop hasn’t yet dreamed of supporting. For example, in Photoshop
Elements 7, you can create postcards, greeting cards, calendars, and photo
albums with just a few mouse clicks. You can place orders with online serv-
ice centers that professionally print your photo creations. All these opportu-
nities are available in Elements, and we cover these and many more creation
ideas in Book IX.
The downside to the Photoshop Elements program is that version 7 is 
supported only in Windows as of this writing. Adobe has intimated that
Photoshop Elements may appear on the Macintosh, and we’ve included
some Mac features in this book in anticipation of the Mac release. However,
as we write this book, we’ve been restricted to using Elements on Windows.
Don’t think of Photoshop Elements as a scaled-down version of Adobe
Photoshop. Those days are gone. If you’re a digital photographer and you
shoot your pictures in JPEG or Camera Raw format, Elements has the tools
for you to open, edit, and massage your pictures into professional images. 
If you worry about color profile embedding, forget it. Elements can handle
the task for you, as we explain in Book III, Chapter 3, where we talk about
Camera Raw, and in Book IX, Chapter 3, which covers color profiling and
printing. For the professional, Photoshop Elements has just about everything
you need to create final images for color desktop and commercial printing.

About This Book
This book is our best effort to provide a comprehensive view of a wildly 
feature-rich program. There’s a lot to Elements, and we try to offer you as
much as possible within our limited amount of space. We begged for more
pages, but alas, our publisher wants to get this book in your hands in full
color and with an attractive price tag. Therefore, even though we may skip
over a few little things, all you need to know about using Photoshop
Elements for designing images for print, sharing, Web hosting, versatile
packaging, e-mailing, and more is covered in the pages ahead.
As we said, Photoshop Elements has something for just about everyone. We
know that our audience is large and that not everyone will use every tool,
command, or method described in this book. Therefore, we added a lot of
cross-references in the text, in case you want to jump around. You can go to
just about any chapter and start reading; if some concept needs more expla-
nation, we point you in the right direction for getting some background
when it’s necessary.
If you’re new to a Dummies All-in-One, you should be aware that a book in
this series is really several books in one. This work contains nine separate
books covering distinct areas of Photoshop Elements. You can jump around
in the book and investigate the areas that interest you most. Generally,
there is no need to read through chapters in order before going to the chap-
ter dealing with the tasks you are most interested in exploring.
Each of the nine books contains several chapters covering a particular cate-
gory of image editing, sharing files, and making creations.
Book I: Introducing Elements
We begin Book I by introducing you to Elements as it appears onscreen the
first time you launch the program. The Elements Welcome screen permits you
to enter several different workspaces. We cover creating a Photoshop.com
account early in Chapter 1 of this book because many other editing tasks you
perform (as well as the results you want to show off) are supported with
Photoshop.com.
We talk about changing workspaces, setting up your work environment,
looking at tools and menus, discovering the various panels, using shortcuts,
and getting help in Chapter 1. In Chapter 2 we explore in depth the tools
used in Full Edit mode. We provide the basics for using the tools so you
have a clear understanding of what they do before delving into chapters
where we use the tools to create a variety of results.
In Chapter 3, we look at navigation and viewing. We explore using the
Navigator panel, changing views between workspaces, zooming in and out

of photos, and cover all you need to know about the Image Window when
working in Full Edit mode. In Chapter 4 we cover preference settings you use
in the Organizer and Full Edit mode for customizing your workspace. Every
preference setting you can make in Photoshop Elements is covered in this
chapter.
Book II: Elements Fundamentals
As the name implies, we talk about essential fundamentals in this book. Look
here for opening, closing, saving files, using the Organizer workspace, acquir-
ing images from your digital cameras and scanners, and a whole lot of cover-
age on sorting and finding your pictures. We also cover creating albums and
keyword tags, creating new catalogs, and backing up your photos. 
Book III: Image Essentials
In this book, we handle all you’d ever want to know about the characteris-
tics of images. This book is image-centric — the place where we cover many
essentials such as resolution, color modes, file formats, working with
Camera Raw, and managing color.
Book IV: Selections
This important book gives you all the juicy details and techniques on creat-
ing and modifying selections. You find out about each of the selection tools
and how to modify selections, feather selections, refine edges, as well as
save and load selections.
Book V: Painting, Drawing, and Typing
If you want to know about the drawing and painting tools, this book is for
you. Here we cover the Brush and Pencil tools, along with the multifaceted
Brushes panel. We also show you how to create vector shapes by using the
shape tools and how to fill and stroke selections. 
Head to this book to find out how to create both gradients and patterns and,
last but not least, become familiar with the type tools and how to use them
to create and edit standard type, type on and in a path, and type with spe-
cial effects.
Book VI: Working with Layers and Masks
This book gives you everything you need to work with layers and masks. We
show you how to save and edit selections as alpha channels so that you can
reload them later. And we show you how to work with the various kinds of
masks — quick masks, layer masks, and channel masks — and how you can
use each to select difficult elements. We talk about managing layers, playing
with opacity blends, and transforming and simplifying layers.

Book VII: Filters, Effects, Styles, and Distortions
We filled this book with tons of handy tips and techniques on using filters to
correct your images to make them sharper, blurrier, cleaner, and smoother —
whatever fits your fancy. We give you the scoop on the Smart Filters feature,
which enables you to apply filters nondestructively. You also find out how
to use filters to give your image a certain special effect, such as a deckled
edge or water droplets. Finally, we introduce the Liquify command so that
you can see the wonder of its distortion tools — and how they can turn
your image into digital taffy. 
Book VIII: Retouching and Enhancing
You find everything you need to know about color correction or color
enhancement in Book VIII — getting rid of colorcasts, improving contrast
and saturation, remapping, and replacing colors.
In addition, we include using the focus and toning tools to manually lighten,
darken, smooth, soften, and sharpen areas of your image. You get to see
how you can use the Clone Stamp tool, the Healing tools, and the Red Eye
tool to fix flaws and imperfections in your images, making them good as
new. We also show you the Color Replacement tool and how to replace your
image’s original color with the foreground color. And, if you get a little con-
fused, we show you how to get all the help you need to work through many
edits where we talk about using Guided mode. Finally, you get some tidbits
on how to composite images using some easy steps.
Book IX: Creating and Sharing with Elements
The wonderful worlds of creations and sharing is the topic for this book.
Elements provides you with some extraordinary creation opportunities
such as creating slide shows, photo books, calendars, greeting cards, flip
books, and more. We go into detail for each of these creation options. Not
all files are destined for online viewing so we cover the complex world of
printing color images and getting color right with color profiles in this book.
We then move on to preparing files for Web hosting. Finally, we top off the
last chapter with details on sharing your photos on Photoshop.com, using
some third-party sharing services, and e-mailing your creations.
About the Web Site
We had so much to talk about we couldn’t squeeze it into a measly 672
pages. So you’ll find a lot of great material on this book’s companion Web
site www.dummies.com/go/pseaio. Find out how to use the Content Panel
and get the details on how Mac users can use Adobe Bridge to organize and
manage their image files.

Icons Used in This Book
5
Conventions Used in This Book
Throughout this book, we point you to menus where commands are
accessed frequently. A couple of things to remember are the references for
where to go when we detail steps in a procedure. For accessing a menu com-
mand, you may see a sentence like this one:
Choose File➪Get Photos and Videos➪From Files and Folders.
When you see commands like this one mentioned, we’re asking you to click
the File menu to open the drop-down menu, click the menu command
labeled Get Photos and Videos, and then choose the command From Files
and Folders from the submenu that appears.
Another convention we use refers to context menus. A context menu jumps
up at your cursor position and shows you a menu similar to the menu you
select at the top of the Elements workspace. To open a context menu, click
the right mouse button. 
A third item relates to using keystrokes on your keyboard. When we mention
that some keys need to be pressed on your keyboard, the text is described
like this:
Press Alt/Option+Shift+Ctrl/Command+S 
In this case, you hold down the Alt key (on Windows) or the Option key (on
the Macintosh), the Shift key, and the Control key (on Windows) or the
Command key (on the Macintosh) and then press the S key. Then release all
the keys at the same time.
Icons Used in This Book
In the margins throughout this book, you’ll see icons indicating that some-
thing important is stated in the respective text.
A tip tells you about an alternative method for a procedure, by giving you a
shortcut, a workaround, or some other type of helpful information related to
working on tasks in the section being discussed.
Pay particular attention when you see the Warning icon. This information
informs you when you may experience a problem performing your work in
Elements.

Where to Go from Here

This icon is a heads-up for something you may want to commit to memory.
Usually, it tells you about a shortcut for a repetitive task, where remember-
ing a procedure can save you time.
Elements is a computer program, after all. No matter how hard we try to
simplify our explanation of features, we can’t entirely avoid the technical
information. If we think that a topic is complex, we use this icon to alert you
that we’re moving into a complex subject. You won’t see many of these
icons in the book because we try our best to bring the details to non-
technical terms.
This icon informs you that the item discussed is a new feature in Photoshop
Elements 7.
This icon points to content you’ll find on this book’s companion Web site,
which you can find at www.dummies.com/go/pseaio.
Where to Go from Here
Feel free to jump around and pay special attention to the cross-referenced
chapters, in case you get stuck on a concept. If you’re new to image editing,
you’ll want to pick up some basics. Look over Books I and II to get a grip on
images and the environment you work in with Elements.
When you need a little extra help, refer to Book I, Chapter 1, where we talk
about using the online help documents available in Elements.
We wish you much success and enjoyment in using Adobe Photoshop
Elements 7, and it is our sincere wish that the pages ahead provide you with
an informative and helpful view of the program.

B
ecause we try to present all books as stand-
alone elements so you can move around and
jump in at any chapter, a little foundation always
helps make understanding the big concepts a bit
easier.
We start this book with some essentials related to
the Elements workspace, tell you how to launch
the program, and offer you a description of many
resources available to you.
If you’re new to Elements, this book is your best
starting place. Be sure to review Chapter 2 where
we cover all the tools used in Full Edit mode and
Chapter 4 where we talk about adjusting Preferences
to customize your work environment.

ow! There’s a lot to Photoshop Elements 7! Just look at the many
pages in this first chapter — and we aren’t even going to talk about
fixing up your pictures. We are, however, going to talk about some pretty
essential stuff to help you move quickly and efficiently around the program,
as well as to figure out how to access all those wonderful tools that
Elements offers you for editing your pictures.
This chapter may not be the most fun part of this book, but it is a critical
first step for anyone new to Elements. Stay with us while we break down
all the areas in the Photoshop Elements workspace where you
can turn that photo of Aunt Gina into something that
Whistler’s mom would envy.
Launching Elements
After running the installer from the Photoshop
Elements CD, double-click the program icon to
launch Elements. Upon launch, you see the Adobe
Photoshop Welcome screen, as shown in Figure 1-1.

Launching Elements
10
Figure 1-1: Double-click the program icon to launch Photoshop 
Elements.
Four buttons at the top of the photo image in the Welcome screen take you
to different windows where you can perform all your image-editing and file-
management tasks. These four buttons are
 Organize: Click the Organize button and Elements opens the Organizer,
the window where you take care of a plethora of file-management and
organization tasks. Among other options, you can choose to load pictures
in the Organizer window so they are ready to use for all your projects. 
 Edit: Click the Edit button to open the Photoshop Elements Full Edit
mode. Here you perform all the editing for your photos.
 Create: Click the Create button and Elements opens the Create panel,
ready for you to assemble a variety of different projects.
 Share: Click the Share button and the same Organizer window opens
with the Share panel exposed. You use it to share images and export
files to CD-ROMs, DVDs, as well as for a variety of print options.
Each time you launch Photoshop Elements, the Welcome screen is the first
item you see on your monitor. From the Welcome screen you choose the
kind of tasks you want to accomplish in a session. If you want to change
from one window to another, for example change from the Organizer to Full
Edit mode, you can easily navigate workspaces after you open one editing
environment, as we explain later in this chapter.
The photo image you see in Figure 1-1, along with any of the help informa-
tion displayed there, may be slightly different from what you see on your
monitor when you launch Elements. The Welcome screen appears in an
Adobe Flash interface, and the photo images scroll through a series of dif-
ferent images. You can manually scroll through the images and the help
information by clicking the arrows at the bottom-right corner of the
Welcome screen.

Introducing Photoshop.com
If you’ve used earlier versions of Photoshop Elements, you immediately
notice an addition to the Photoshop Elements Welcome screen. Take a look
at the Photoshop.com Membership area on the left side of the Welcome
screen. 
Photoshop.com is a free service provided by Adobe Systems that permits
you to host files on Adobe’s Web servers and share your files and photo
albums with people anywhere in the world. In order to take advantage of the
service, though, you need to sign up. When you first launch Elements, it’s a
good idea to create an Adobe ID and log on to the service. After you log on,
you can begin uploading images and sharing files.
Here’s how you can create your own Photoshop.com account: 
1. Launch Photoshop Elements.
Double-click the program icon to launch the program. If you are using
Windows and don’t have a program shortcut on your desktop, use the
Start menu and choose Programs➪Photoshop Elements 7.0. If you’re
using a Macintosh and you haven’t (yet) added an Elements icon to the
Dock, open the Macintosh HD, find (and open) the Photoshop Elements
7.0 folder within the Applications folder, and then double-click the pro-
gram icon.
2. In the Welcome window, click the Join Now button on the left.
3. In the new screen that appears, fill in your personal information as
shown in Figure 1-2.
4. Click the Create Account button.
When you click Create Account, you send a request to Adobe Systems.
A message will be returned to you in your e-mail client. You must reply
to the message to verify your e-mail address. Adobe then creates your
account, and you can log on to the service using your Adobe ID.
After you create an Adobe ID and set up an account, you log on to the
Photoshop.com service by clicking the Sign In button that appears on the
lower left in the Welcome page when you launch Photoshop Elements.
After logging on, you find an easy-to-use interface that supports uploading
and sharing your photos. For more information on using Photoshop.com,
see Book IX, Chapter 4.

Opening the Organizer
The Organizer is one of several different workspaces available to you with
Photoshop Elements. Unless you have an immediate task at hand for editing
a photo in the Full Edit workspace, the Organizer is often going to be the
first workspace you visit. In the Organizer, you can manage photos and navi-
gate to every other editing workspace that Elements provides for you.
To open the Organizer, click the Organize button on the Welcome screen.
When you first install Elements and open the Organizer, you see an empty
screen as shown in Figure 1-3.
You add photos to the Organizer window by using a variety of options that
are covered in Chapter 3 of this minibook. For now, let’s focus on the
Organizer tools. Some of the more important tools in the Organizer include
 Photoshop Elements Welcome Screen: Click this tool and the Welcome
screen shown earlier in Figure 1-1 opens.
 Menu bar: The menus contain all the commands you use in the
Organizer workspace. Throughout all these books, we talk about using
menu commands. You find much more detail about the Menu bar in
Book II. 
 Sign In: Click this button to sign in to Photoshop.com. You must have a
logon ID and password in order to sign in.
 Join Now: If you haven’t joined Photoshop.com, click this button to
open the sign up window where you can sign up for a Photoshop.com
account.

 Undo/Redo: These tools permit you to undo and redo edits. 
 Display: When you open the drop-down menu, you find an assortment
of commands for importing files, changing views, and comparing files.
 Editor: Elements provides you with two different editing modes that we
explain later in this chapter.
 Options bar: Some navigation tools appear active when you have
photos added to the Organizer window. You can scroll images, change
viewing zoom levels, and rotate images without opening them in one of
the editors.

names of these panels are shown at the top of the bin. The panels offer

 Catalog Info: In the lower-left
corner of the Organizer window,
you find some information related
to a catalog. When you add photos
to the Organizer, your photos are
maintained in a catalog file. The
information at the bottom of the
Organizer window reports feed-
back on the catalog name, the
number of items contained in the
catalog, and the date range for
when the photos were taken.
Changing Workspaces
Think of the Organizer as your central workspace. From there, you travel 
to other workspaces where edits and creations are handled. The Organizer
is like a huge file cabinet with a vast number of tools and commands that
help you keep track of your images. It also offers you a gateway to other
workspaces.

Visiting the Organizer
You can’t do much with the window shown in Figure 1-1 because you
haven’t added any photos. In order to manage photos and apply edits, you
need to load some photos in the default catalog that appears (empty, obvi-
ously) when you first launch Elements. 
To add some photos to the default catalog, do the following:
1. Copy some photos to your hard drive.
Make a new folder on your hard drive and call it something like My
Photos or use some other descriptive name.
2. Launch Elements.
Double-click the program icon or use the Start menu to open Elements.
3. Click Organize in the Welcome screen.
4. Choose File➪Get Photos and Videos➪From Files and Folders.
The Get Photos From Files and Folders dialog box opens as shown in
Figure 1-6. Open the Look In menu and navigate your hard drive to
locate the folder where you copied your photos.
5. Select the photos to import.
If you want to import all photos from a given folder, press Ctrl/Ô+A. If
you want to select individual photos, click a photo and press the Ctrl/Ô
key while clicking additional photos.

You have some other options available in the Get Photos from Files and
Folders dialog box. But for now, just click Get Photos and leave all the
other items at the defaults.
7. Click OK in the alert dialog box.
An alert dialog box opens, as
shown in Figure 1-7, informing 
you that you need to click the
Show All button if you want to see
all photos in your catalog. This
button appears at the top of the
Organizer window.
8. View the photos in the Organizer.
As shown in Figure 1-8, photos appear in the Organizer window. Drag
the scroll bar at the right side of the Organizer and to the left of the
Panel Bin to scroll though the images.

When you open the Get Photos from Files and Folders dialog box you see
thumbnail previews for images saved as JPEG or TIF files. If you import
Camera Raw images, you won’t see image previews. For more information on
working with Camera Raw images, see Book III, Chapter 3.
A number of file-management options are available in the Organizer for sort-
ing images, tagging files with keywords, and creating albums of photos. We
cover all you can do with file management in the section about the
Organizer in Book I, Chapter 2.
Visiting Full Edit mode
Elements provides you with two editing modes — Full Edit and Quick Fix.
The Full Edit mode is where you have access to all the tools and commands
that provide you with limitless opportunities for editing your pictures.
Quick Fix mode can be used when you need to polish up an image by adjust-
ing brightness, contrast, color, fix red-eye problems, or perform similar edit-
ing tasks.
After you have files loaded in the Organizer, you can easily open an image in
an editing mode. If you want to edit a picture big time, do the following to
launch the Full Edit mode workspace:
1. Click an image thumbnail in the
Organizer.
This step presumes you have
added photos to the Organizer as
described earlier in this chapter.
2. Open the Editor drop-down menu
and choose Full Edit.
The Editor drop-down menu is at
the top of the Organizer window, as shown in Figure 1-9. After you make
the menu choice, the selected image appears in the Full Edit workspace
as shown in Figure 1-10.
3. Click the Organizer button in the Full Edit mode window.
To return to the Organizer, click the Organizer button as shown in 
Figure 1-10.

When you open a file from the Organizer or you change to another work-
space while the Organizer is open, you essentially have two workspaces
open in Elements. The second workspace (such as Full Edit mode) opens
while the Organizer remains open. When you toggle back and forth between
the modes, each mode remains open until you quit one mode or the other.
Figure 1-10: Choosing Full Edit from the Editor drop-down menu opens the file in the Full Edit
workspace.
Visiting Quick Fix mode
The Quick Fix mode is easily opened from either the Organizer workspace
or from the Full Edit workspace. If you have the Organizer in view, you can
choose Quick Fix from the Editor drop-down menu. If you are in Full Edit
mode and want to switch to Quick Fix mode, click the Quick button in the
Panel Bin and the Quick Fix mode opens, as shown in Figure 1-11.

Changing Workspaces
19
Comparing the modes
When you examine Figures 1-8, 1-10, and 1-11 you see different tools and
panel options. Each mode is designed to help you with different tasks. In
Figure 1-8, we see the Organizer where you can manage files and easily work
with projects and file sharing. In Full Edit mode, shown in Figure 1-10, you
have access to all of Elements’ editing tools and menu commands to enhance
your photos in limitless ways. In Quick Fix mode, shown in Figure 1-11, you
see the different options for giving images a quick makeover.
Figure 1-11: While in Full Edit mode, you can easily open Quick Fix mode by clicking the Quick
button in the Panel Bin.
In the following chapters, we cover each of the modes, the tools accessible
in each mode, and all the menu commands accessible to you for each mode.

Be sure you understand how to toggle
through the modes to gain access to the
tools you want to use.
In addition to the buttons at the top of
the Organizer and those in the Panel
Bin, when in either editing mode you
can easily navigate modes using the
Status bar (Windows) or the Dock
(Macintosh). The Status bar/Dock
serves to open applications. Click an
application to open the workspace you
want. 
Getting help with 
Guided mode
Although not entirely a separate mode,
the Guided panel changes the appear-
ance of the Photo Bin to offer you help
with many different editing tasks. When
in either Full Edit or Quick Fix mode,
click the Guided tab in the Panel Bin
and the Guided panel opens, as shown
in Figure 1-12.
The panel lists topics for you to review
when performing edits relative to a par-
ticular category. Click one of the cate-
gory items and the panel changes,
displaying info tailored to that specific
editing task as well as some options for
performing a given edit. In Figure 1-13,
we clicked Crop Photo to open the Crop
panel. From the Crop Box Size drop-
down menu, we chose 8 x 10 in.
Click other items in the Guided panel
and you find helpful hints to guide you
through a number of common image-
editing tasks.
Figure 1-12: Click Guided to open the
Guided panel.

Moving through the Menu Bar
21
Figure 1-13: The Crop panel offers options for cropping images to standard photo sizes by
making choices in a drop-down menu.
Moving through the Menu Bar
As with most programs on your computer, Elements offers you a number of
drop-down menus with many different commands that invoke actions. It’s
not important to memorize all the menu commands. Instead, try to develop
an understanding of the types of actions included in a given menu. A general
understanding of uses of the different menus helps you find commands
much faster. 
The menus in the Organizer are different from those in the two editing modes.
Full Edit and Quick Fix contain the same menu names, but some menu com-
mands are grayed out when in Quick Fix mode.
First, take a look at the menus in the Organizer. Among the Organizer menus
you find
 File: In the File menu, as you might suspect, you find commands to open
and browse files on your hard disk. You also find a number of options
for saving files such as writing images to CD-ROMs, DVDs, and remov-
able media. Commands for managing catalogs, moving files, and printing
images are also located in this menu.
 Edit: Many items you are familiar with — copy, undo, delete, and so on —
are located in the Edit menu. In the Organizer, you also find many options
for sorting files as well as options for managing color. In addition, you find
Book I
Chapter 1
Examining the
Elements
Environment

Moving through the Menu Bar
22
a number of quick-access commands for editing photos similar to options
you find in Quick Fix mode.
 Find: The Find menu is all about finding images on your computer.
You have many choices for searching photos based on a wide range of
criteria. 
 View: The View menu handles commands related to viewing images in
the Organizer window. You can choose what types of media to display
in the Organizer, show and hide files, and show and hide certain data
associated with files such as the filenames. Choices you make in this
menu relate to the displays of images in the Organizer.
 Window: The Window menu contains commands that display some items
in the Organizer such as the Timeline, where you can view photos
according to date ranges. The Window menu also has commands for con-
trolling the display of some panels in the Panel Bin, such as the Quick
Share and Properties panels.
 Help: As you might suspect, the Help menu contains menu commands
that provide help when working in Elements. Certain help commands
open your default Web browser and open help Web pages on Adobe’s 
Web site. 
Keep in mind that the Organizer is quite distinct from the two editing
modes. It turns out, though, that the Quick Fix and Full Edit modes are iden-
tical in terms of menu names, and both contain many similar commands.
What you find in the editing modes for the most part is very different from
the menu items found in the Organizer. Both Quick Fix and Full Edit mode
contain the following menus:
 File: You find file opening and saving options in the File menu as well as
printing commands. The File menu also contains some options for com-
bining images and batch processing files.
 Edit: The Edit menu offers you a number of editing options, such as
copy/paste, copy merged, paste into selections, setting up files, and
using patterns and brushes. You also find color-management options
identical to the commands in the Organizer Edit menu.
 Image: The Image menu contains commands that are used for changing
images, such as cropping, resizing, changing color modes, converting
color profiles, and transforming images. Notice that there are no image
corrections for brightness and color adjustments. These commands are
contained in the Enhance menu.
 Enhance: The Enhance menu is all about working with images in terms
of color and brightness corrections and altering the visual appearance
of images.
 Layer: The Layer menu has to do with working with layers and gives
you access to the many different things you can do with layers.

Using Context Menus
23
 Select: The Select menu has to do with creating and using selections.
One of the most frequent phases of an edit is creating a selection, and
the Selection menu provides you with a number of commands and tools
to help you perfect your selection of image content.
 Filter: For artistic edits, take a look at the Filter menu and explore the
many filter effects you can add to your pictures. You don’t need to be
a Photoshop Elements expert. The program makes it easy for you by
keeping all the filters in one place, so that with the click of the mouse
button you can create some dazzling effects.
 View: Viewing options in the editors relate to zooming in and out of
photos, showing rulers and guides, and creating new windows.
 Window: The Window menu displays a list of panels that can be opened
and closed. You also find a list of all open files in this menu up to a maxi-
mum number of windows you determine in the Elements preferences.
 Help: The Help menu is identical to the Organizer Help menu.
Why review a brief explanation of the menus and the commands you find
within the drop-down lists? For starters, the more you know about what a
menu is used for, the easier it is for you to locate commands without a strug-
gle. If your task is to color-correct a photo, you know from the list described
here that you open one of the Editing modes and visit the Enhance menu. If
you want to stack photos and organize them, you know that you need to
open the Organizer and open the Edit menu. After you get a feel for what
commands are contained within the drop-down menus, you move much
faster in all your Elements editing sessions.
Using Context Menus
Context menus are found in just about every Adobe program. One of the
great things about context menus is that if you want to perform an action
using a menu command or tool, chances are you may find just what you’re
looking for in a context menu.
A context menu is opened by right-clicking the mouse button (Windows) or
by Ctrl-clicking (Macintosh). Depending on the tool and the mode you’re
working in, the menu commands change. For example, in Figure 1-14 we
opened a context menu on a thumbnail image in the Organizer. As you can
see in the figure, a number of menu commands are available that are similar
to the menu commands you find in the top-level menu commands.
In Figure 1-15, we opened an image in Full Edit mode and created a selection.
When we right-click the mouse button (Windows) or Ctrl-click (Macintosh),
the context menu changed to reflect edits we can make relative to a selection.

When you change tools and editing modes, the context menus you open
change the menu choices to reflect what you can do with the selected tool
and editing mode you’re working in.
Selecting Settings in the Options Bar
A number of different tools and options exist in several places in each mode.
One area you frequently visit when you edit pictures is the Options bar. The
Options bar provides several choices for each tool you select in Full Edit
mode. In Figure 1-16, we opened Full Edit mode and clicked the Rectangular
Marquee tool. The Options bar changes to reflect a number of choices you
can use when working with this tool.
Figure 1-16: Click the Rectangular Marquee tool, and the Options bar changes to display
settings options that can be used with the Rectangular Marquee tool.
As you click different tools in the Tools panel, the Options bar changes to
support a number of different choices for working with the selected tool.

Playing with Panels
The Panels Bin contains more choices for editing files, assembling projects,
and working with different tools. Each mode you visit (Organizer, Full Edit,
and Quick Fix) supports panels and a variety of options from panel menus
and tools. In Full Edit mode, you see the default panels open, as shown in
Figure 1-17.
At the top of the Panel Bin are tabs. In Full Edit mode, the tabs include Edit,
Create, and Share. Click a tab and the panel options change. Below the tabs
are also other buttons that open different modes. For example, the panel
shown in Figure 1-17 displays the Full, Quick, and Guided buttons. When
you click Quick or Guided, you change modes to Quick Edit mode or Guided
mode.
Figure 1-17: The default panel view in Full Edit mode.
If you open the Organizer, you find different options in the Panel Bin,
as shown in Figure 1-18. From this panel, you can easily open the other edit-
ing modes, perform some creation edits, or organize files using tags and
keywords.

Figure 1-18: Panel options change in the Organizer.
Getting choosy in the Favorites panel
The Favorites panel is used for adding your own favorite settings in Full Edit
mode, such as different filters you like to apply to images. By default you
won’t see the Favorites panel open. You open the panel by choosing
Window➪Favorites. When you make the menu choice, the panel opens as a
floating panel in the middle of the Image Window. A floating panel opens on
top of the Elements window and can be dragged around to move the panel
out of the way when editing photos.
You can choose to keep the panel open in the Image Window or dock the panel
in the Panel Bin by dragging the Panel tab to the Panel Bin. In Figure 1-19, you
see the Favorites panel as a floating panel with some favorite filters added to
the panel.

Figure 1-19: The Favorites panel opened as a floating panel.
Using panel menus
When you have your panels docked in
the Panel Bin, you see two right-point-
ing arrows at the top-right corner.
Click the arrows and a drop-down
menu opens, as shown in Figure 1-20.
Depending on which panel you open,
you see several menu commands used
specifically with the panel you are in
when you open the menu. If a panel is
opened as a floating panel, you see More
appearing instead of the two pointing
arrows. Clicking More has the same
effect. A drop-down menu opens, offer-
ing you the same menu choices as you
have when you open the panel while
docked in the Panel Bin.
Using the Project Bin
You may have several images you want to edit in Elements. You might have
some image data you want to copy from one image and paste into another
image, or maybe you want to enhance a series of images so the brightness

and color appear consistent for several images taken with the same lighting
conditions.
The photos are added to the Organizer, and you can easily see the thumb-
nail images in the Organizer window. But you don’t want to keep going back
to the Organizer to open one image or another in an editing mode.
Fortunately, Elements provides you with an easy way to load some images
while in Full Edit mode and display the thumbnail images. It uses an area
called the Project Bin, as shown in Figure 1-21. Any file you currently have
open in Full Edit mode is automatically added to the Project Bin.
Figure 1-21: Several images opened in Full Edit mode appear in the Project Bin.
The images shown in the Project Bin are easily accessed by double-clicking
the image, after which you can apply any of the edits supported in Full Edit
mode. You can also open several files in Full Edit mode and create a project
from the files, such as a calendar or photo book. 
At the top-right corner of an image opened in the Image Window, you find
three icons (three dots in the top-left corner on the Macintosh). Clicking an
icon performs one of the following actions:
Book I

Environment

Getting Productive with Shortcuts
30
 Minimize: The minus symbol (Windows) or center dot (Macintosh) is
used to minimize the window. When you click this icon, the file remains
open in Full Edit mode but it disappears from the Image Window and
remains open in the Project Bin.
 Maximize: The rectangle icon appearing in the center of the three icons
maximizes the image in the Image Window. If the image appears smaller
than the space allocated for viewing and editing images, click this icon
to zoom the view to fill the Image Window.
 Close: Click the X in the top-right corner (Windows) or top-left corner
(Macintosh) of an image opened in the Image Window and the photo
disappears from Full Edit mode. The photo still remains in the
Organizer, but it’s closed in the editor.
When you’re editing a number of images in Full Edit mode and you want to
eliminate a given image from the Image Window but keep the image open in
the Project Bin, click the Minimize button. If you click the Close button, you
need to reopen the file.
Getting Productive with Shortcuts
Every Adobe program supports keyboard shortcuts, and Elements makes use
of many different keystroke actions that open menus and select various tools.
As a matter of fact, the keystroke commands available to you are so numer-
ous that it would take considerable time to commit all of them to memory.
Fortunately, you have many hints pro-
vided by Elements as you organize and
work on your photos. The hints you 
find for using keyboard shortcuts are
found in
 Menus: When you open a menu and
scan through the different com-
mands, you find that many com-
mands list a keyboard shortcut,
as shown in Figure 1-22.
Look at Figure 1-22. If you want to
use Auto Smart Fix (the first menu
item), you press the Alt+Ctrl+M
(Option+Ô+M on the Mac) to
invoke the menu command. Using
the keyboard shortcut results in
exactly same action as selecting
the menu command.
Figure 1-22: The items to the right of
the menu commands display keyboard
shortcuts.

Finding Help When You Need It
31
 Tools: When you move the cursor
over a tool in the Tools panel, a
pop-up tooltip opens, as shown in
Figure 1-23. To the right of the tool
name you see a character within
parentheses. Typing the character
on your keyboard accesses the tool.
For example, in Figure 1-23 you see
the Horizontal Type Tool below the
selection arrow. The character in
the tooltip is T. If you press T on
your keyboard, the Horizontal
Type tool is selected. Each of the
tools is selected by typing individ-
ual characters on the keyboard.
The best way to learn keyboard short-
cuts is to observe the menus and tools
when you perform edits. For those edits
you use frequently, try to commit the
keyboard shortcuts to memory. As you
learn more shortcuts, you’ll find work-
ing in Elements goes much faster.
Finding Help When You Need It
We hope this book provides you with some helpful information on using all
the features you have available when working in Photoshop Elements.
However, you won’t want to keep paging through the book for every edit you
make. 
For speedy access to readily available help information or when you want to
expand your knowledge of commands, tools, procedures, and so on, you
have several sources of help information. 
Using Help
The first place to explore is the Help menu. Open the Help menu and you
find a menu command to access the Photoshop Elements help guide. The
help guide is a Web-based file that is hosted on Adobe’s Web site. You need
an Internet connection in order to access the file.
After choosing Help➪Photoshop Elements Help or pressing the F1 key on
your keyboard, you can search for keywords. Press the Enter key after
typing the words you want to search for, and Elements opens a panel on the

left listing areas where you can find answers. Double-click an item and the
right pane provides you with help information.
Reading PDFs from the Installer CD-ROM
On the Installer CD-ROM, you find several PDF documents. You need Adobe
Reader installed on your computer to see these files. The Installer disc con-
tains the Adobe Reader installer. Double-click the installer to install Adobe
Reader. Then, take some time to browse the contents of the CD-ROM for
PDF documents.
Using tooltips
We covered tooltips earlier when we talked about keyboard shortcuts in
Elements. As you place the cursor over tools and in panels, you can observe
the tooltips. These contain some helpful information concerning the types
of edits you want to perform or notification of an action that will take place
when you click an object or command.
Dialog boxes
When you open many different dialog boxes, you find some text adjacent to
a light bulb icon and beginning with Learn more about: followed by blue
text, as shown in Figure 1-24. Click the blue text and again Adobe’s Web site
opens and takes you to Web pages where help information is found.
Figure 1-24: You can find links to help information in dialog boxes.
Each time you see a light bulb icon appearing in a dialog box, you’re one
click away from help information.

Chapter 2: Getting to Know
the Tools
In This Chapter
 Looking at the Tools panel
 Understanding the tool groups
 Using automation tools
You edit photos by using menu commands and tools. Elements knows
that, so it provides you with a toolshed chock-full of different tools to
perform all sorts of different editing tasks. 
These tasks include selecting image content area, refining and sharpening
photos, drawing and painting applications, adding text, and more.
In addition to using tools for manually changing the characteristics of a
photo, you can use a number of different tools to magically automate tasks.
In this chapter, you take a look at the Tools panel and all the different tools
at your disposal for modifying photos in many different ways.
Examining the Tools Panel
The Tools panel opens by default when you enter Full
Edit mode. As you may recall from Book I, Chapter 1,
you can open Full Edit mode directly from the
Welcome screen by clicking the Edit button or by
choosing Editor➪Full Edit in the Organizer. 
The tools you see in Figure 2-1 are listed showing
their keyboard shortcuts. If you press the key adja-
cent to the tools shown in Figure 2-1, you select the
respective tool. See Chapter 1 for more on keyboard
shortcuts.

Examining the Tools Panel
34
Figure 2-1: The Tools panel.
The tools in the Tools panel include the following, listed (basically) from
top to bottom. To get you into the habit of using keyboard shortcuts, we’ve
listed the shortcut associated with each tool.
Where you see a tiny right arrow on a tool, you find additional tools that
open in a fly-out toolbar. Pressing the same keyboard shortcut scrolls
through the tools in the fly-out toolbar.
V. Move tool: Use this tool to move either content within a selection or
the entire image.
Z. Zoom tool: Click with this tool found in the Tools palette and you zoom
in on an image. Press the Alt/Option key when the tool is selected and
click to zoom out.
H. Hand tool: The Hand tool is used to move an image around the image
window without changing the image position on the canvas. If you zoom
in on a photo and see scroll bars on the right and left side of the image
window, you can drag the image around the window to display the
hidden areas.
I. Eyedropper tool: The Eyedropper is used to sample color in an image.
Click anywhere in a photo and the foreground color swatch changes to
the sample taken with the Eyedropper tool. Press the Alt/Option key
and click the Eyedropper tool to sample color for the background color.

M. Marquee Rectangle tool: The Marquee Rectangle tool is one of many
different tools you use to select image data.
L. Lasso tool: Another selection tool, the Lasso tool is used to select image
data in a freeform manner.
W. Magic Wand tool: Like the Eyedropper, the Magic Wand tool is used to
sample color in an image, but it then allows you to travel out from the
sampled area to automatically select similar pixels in a contiguous or
noncontiguous area. The contiguity is determined from choices made in
the Options bar.
A. Quick Selection tool: The Quick Selection tool is similar to the Magic
Wand tool. It enables you to click and drag to select image data.
T. Horizontal Type tool: This tool is used to add text to a photo.
C. Crop tool: This tool is used for cropping images.
Q. Cookie Cutter tool: This tool is used to create a mask so the area out-
side the shape is removed from the photo.
P. Straighten tool: Use this tool to straighten images — particularly
scanned images.
Y. Red Eye Removal tool: Use this tool to remove red eye from photos.
J. Healing Brush tool: This tool is used to repair images by removing dust
and scratches.
S. Clone Stamp tool: This tool is used to clone an image area.
E. Eraser tool: Use this tool for erasing part of your image.
B. Brush tool: A number of brush tips are available for use with this tool
that permits you to paint over a photo.
F. Smart Brush tool: This tool is magical by design. You can use the tool
to brighten or add contrast to areas you specify by “brushing over” the
image.
K. Paint Bucket tool: The tool is used for filling an area with a foreground
color.
G. Gradient tool: Use this tool to create gradients.
U. Custom Shape tool: This tool is used to add different shapes to a photo.
R. Blur tool: This tool is helpful to soften edges, particularly when you
paste new image content in a photo and want to blur the edges of the
pasted data slightly.
O. Sponge tool: The Sponge tool is used for adding or removing color satu-
ration on a photo.

Getting to Know the Tools
The tools in the Tools panel can be grouped into several categories.
Knowing a little about the categories can help you decide where to look first
when you want to make some edits on a photo.
Using selection tools
The selection tools are used to create selections of pixels in a photo. Unlike
the objects you’d find in programs like Microsoft PowerPoint, imported graph-
ics in Microsoft Word, or artwork you create in illustration programs like
Adobe Illustrator or CorelDraw, photos are comprised of tiny little pixels. In
other programs where objects are available, you can just click the mouse
button with the cursor placed on an object to select it. In Photoshop Elements,
you need to surround pixels with a selection tool to select a part of a photo.
Clicking an object is easy, but selecting pixels requires some careful steps.
It also requires using the best tool to make a given selection. You can easily
run into problems when there is little contrast and color differences between
the areas you want to select and those areas you want to remain unselected
in a photo.
Geometric selection tools
The geometric selection tools include
the Rectangular Marquee tool and the
Elliptical Marquee tool. By default, the
Rectangular Marquee tool appears “on
top” in the Tools panel, whereas the
Elliptical Marquee tool is kept out of
view. So how do you get to the hidden
tool? Easy. Notice the tiny arrow in the
lower-right corner on several tools in the Tools panel? When you click and
hold down the mouse button or right-click, a fly-out toolbar opens, as
shown in Figure 2-2. In Figure 2-2, we clicked and held the Rectangular
Marquee tool to open the fly-out menu where both the Rectangular Marquee
tool and the Elliptical Marquee tool appear.
Figure 2-2: Click and hold down the
mouse button on the tiny arrow on a tool
to open a fly-out toolbar.

We talked about the keyboard shortcuts earlier in this chapter and men-
tioned that you can access the Rectangular Marquee tool from a shortcut by
pressing the M key on your keyboard. If you press M and then press M
again, you select the Elliptical Marquee tool. Continually pressing M on the
keyboard toggles between the Rectangular and Elliptical Marquee tools.
Using geometric selection tools is straightforward. Click either the Marquee
Rectangle tool or the Elliptical Marquee tool and drag on a photo to create a
rectangle or elliptical shape.
You can also use certain keyboard modifiers to manage selections when
using a selection tool. Such modifiers include the following:
 Shift key: If you select a geometric selection tool and then press the
Shift key while dragging the mouse, your shapes are constrained to a
square/circle. Also, if you make a selection on a photo and then press
the Shift key and drag a new selection, you get to add that selection to
the one you’ve already made. If you have made a selection on a photo
and don’t use the Shift key when you create a new selection, the first
area you chose becomes deselected.
 Alt/Option key: When you press the Alt/Option key and drag a geomet-
ric selection tool, you draw the selection from the center outward. If
you already have a selection and you then press the Alt/Option key and
drag through the first selection, you remove that segment from the cur-
rent selection.
 Shift+Alt/Option: If you already have a selection drawn, pressing the
Shift key and the Alt/Option key while dragging through that selection
creates a new selection at the intersection with the original selection.
 Spacebar: If you press the spacebar while you depress the mouse
button, you can move a selection to another area in a photo without
changing the size of the selection.
Lasso tools
Whereas the geometric selection tools
restrict you to rectangles and elliptical
shapes, the Lasso tools are used to
create irregular selections — similar to
freehand drawing with a pencil. The
following three types of Lasso tools are
shown in Figure 2-3:
 Lasso tool: Click this tool and
draw on a photo in a freeform
fashion to select pixels around
irregular shapes.

Figure 2-3: Click the mouse button on
the tiny arrow on the Lasso tool to open the
fly-out toolbar where you find three Lasso
tools.

 Magnetic Lasso tool: Click and drag around a shape and Elements magi-
cally hugs the shape as you draw. If you have something like a fore-
ground figure you want to isolate from the background, you can drag
this tool around the shape. Elements automatically refines the selection
to grab the shape you are selecting.
 Polygonal Lasso tool: This tool behaves like a Polygon tool that
requires you click and release the mouse button and then move the
cursor to click in another area on the photo. As you keep clicking, the
selection shape takes the form of a polygon.
Magic Wand Tool
The Magic Wand tool is truly magical. This tool performs a few different
actions. For example, when you click the tool in an area of a blue sky, the
area you click is sampled for the selected pixel value. Immediately following
the mouse click, Elements travels outward in a contiguous area to find
pixels of similar value and includes them in the selection.
To determine the amount of variance of the pixel values picked up by the
Magic Wand tool, tweak the Tolerance value in the Options bar, as shown
in Figure 2-4. You can change the value so the Magic Wand tool selects a
wider range of pixels (a higher number) or narrower range of pixels (a lower
value).
Figure 2-4: The Tolerance value can be changed to select a wider or 
narrower range of pixels.
By default, the Tolerance is set to 32, which means that the pixel you click
produces a selection of 16 pixel values lower than the sample and 16 pixel
values higher than the sample.
After you create a selection with the Magic Wand tool and you want to add
another selection to the first selection, press the Shift key and click the
Magic Wand tool in another area on the photo. If you grab too many pixels,
you can press the Alt/Option key and click the area you don’t want selected.
If you need to refine the selection, you can adjust the Tolerance value in the
Options bar before clicking the mouse button each time you add to or sub-
tract from a selection.

Getting to Know the Tools
39
Quick Selection tool
The Quick Selection tool is similar to the Magic Wand tool, but you don’t
need to use keyboard modifiers to add to or subtract from selections. You
click the tool in an area of a photo, and three check boxes in the Options bar
permit you to start a new selection, add to the current selection, or subtract
from the current selection. 
In Figure 2-5, we used the Quick Selection tool and clicked a few times in the
sky area of the photo to create the selection.
Figure 2-5: Click the Quick Selection tool in a few areas with similar 
pixel values to create a selection.
After you have a selection — regardless of the tool you use to create the
selection — other edits you perform in Elements are applied only to the
active selection. If no selection appears on your photo, edits are made 
to the entire layer.
Using Figure 2-5 as an example, we left the contrast alone on all areas but
the sky to demonstrate editing a selection. We used the Quick Selection tool
to select just the sky area and adjusted the contrast to make the sky appear
a little brighter and with more contrast, as you can see in Figure 2-6.

Figure 2-6: After you create a selection, you can apply edits to just the selected area.
Using drawing and painting tools
Drawing and painting tools provide you with a huge number of options for
adding illustrations, paintings, effects, and modifying brightness and con-
trast in photos. Don’t think of these tools strictly as tools you use to draw
and paint with. They can also be used for color correction, adjusting con-
trast, and other kinds of brightness enhancements. 
Brush tools
Several types of tools are tucked away
in the Brush tools fly-out menu. To
view all the tools nested there, click
and hold down the mouse button on
the Brush tool to open the fly-out
menu, as shown in Figure 2-7.
Tools you have available from the fly-
out menu include the following:
 Brush tool: The Brush tool supports a number of different brush tips
you can choose from the Options bar. You use the Brush tool as you
would use a brush to apply paint to a canvas. You can paint within type
Figure 2-7: The Brush tools.

selections, add color to selected areas, paint in selection channels, and
more. For more information on selections, see Book IV, Chapter 1. For
more on type selections, see Book V, Chapter 3. For more on selection
channels, see Book VI, Chapter 4.
 Impressionist Brush tool: This tool is designed to paint over your photo
to make it look like a masterpiece by Renoir or Matisse. You can set
various options that change the style of the brush strokes. Styles are
chosen from a drop-down list in the Options bar.
 Color Replacement tool: As the name suggests, you use this tool to
paint over areas where you want to replace color.
 Pencil tool: Like an analog pencil, the Pencil tool enables you to draw
pencil-type marks on a photo. Also from the Options bar you have a
large number of tips to choose from for the pencil drawing shapes.
Smart Brush tools
The two tools shown in Figure 2-8 are
located in the Smart Brush fly-out 
toolbar:
 Smart Brush tool: The Smart
Brush tool is used to paint large
areas of common pixel values.
When you drag across a sky or a section of greenery, for example, you
can select the area and apply different hue changes from choices in a
drop-down list from the Options bar.
 Detail Smart Brush tool: The Detail Smart Brush tool offers similar
options as the Smart Brush tool, but you can continue to paint in the
selected area, applying more hue changes to a given region.
Eraser tools
Three different Eraser tools appear in
the fly-out menu shown in Figure 2-9.
 Eraser tool: The Eraser tool actu-
ally paints a color on a photo. The
current background color is used
when you paint with this tool. If
your photo appears on a Layer,
then the Eraser tool behaves like a normal eraser, removing pixels as
you drag across a photo.
Book I
Chapter 2

 Background Eraser tool: When you open a photo in Full Edit mode, the
photo appears on a background. Certain objects and type are added to
layers that appear above the background. Two things happen when you
make your first edit with this tool: The Background is converted to a layer
and, as you drag the cursor, the image data is removed from the layer.
 Magic Eraser tool: The Magic Eraser tool is like a combination of the
Quick Selection tool and the Eraser tool. When you click and draw on a
background, the area where you click is selected just as with the Quick
Selection tool. Also, the background is converted to a layer, and the
selected area is removed from the photo.
Paint Bucket tool
The Paint Bucket tool performs two separate actions when you click the
tool in a photo. First it creates a selection similar to the one you get with
the Magic Wand tool. After the selection is created, the foreground color
fills the selected area.
Gradient tool
The Gradient tool is used to create a gradient on a photo or within a
selected area. You have a number of choices for the gradient colors from
the Options bar, or you can add custom colors to create the gradient effect.
Using tools for cloning and healing
The cloning and healing tools are used for effects and when you need to clean
up images. Cloning involves duplicating an image area to construct image con-
tent that wasn’t in your original photo, whereas healing (in an Elements con-
text) means removing dust, scratches, and imperfections in photos.
Cloning tools
Cloning tools are designed to duplicate
image area. You can use them for artis-
tic effects, reconstructing photos,
repairing photos, and enhancing
photos. The two tools (shown in
Figure 2-10) are
 Clone Stamp tool: You use this tool by first sampling an area on a photo
you want to clone. Sampling is performed by placing the cursor over
the area to clone, pressing the Alt/Option key, and then clicking the
mouse button. You then move the cursor to an area where the clone
image will appear and start painting with the cursor.
 Pattern Stamp tool: The Pattern Stamp tool is used to apply a pattern you
select from a list of available patterns from the Options bar. Select a pat-
tern and paint with the cursor to apply the pattern to an area on a photo.
Figure 2-10: The Cloning tools.

Healing brushes
Healing brushes are designed for
photo-repair tasks, such as remov-
ing dust and scratches. The two
Healing Brush tools (shown in 
Figure 2-11) are
 Spot Healing Brush tool: The Spot
Healing Brush tool automatically samples neighboring pixels to correct
image imperfections in one step. Unlike when you use the Healing Brush
tool, you don’t need to sample an area and then apply the brush
strokes.
 Healing Brush tool: You use the Healing Brush tool by first pressing the
Alt/Option key and sampling an area you want to use as a source for
the repair. Then move the cursor to a scratch or other imperfection and
paint over the area. 
Creating text with typographical tools
Four different type tools are used to add type to a photo. The tools (shown
in Figure 2-12) include
 Horizontal Type tool: Click the
cursor and type text horizontally.
You can choose from various type
attributes in the Options bar. 
 Vertical Type tool: Use this tool to
add type vertically on a photo.
 Horizontal Type Mask tool: The
Type Mask tools create selection
outlines of type as you add text with the tools. The Horizontal Type
Mask tool creates an outline selection of text horizontally.
 Vertical Type Mask tool: Use this tool to create a selection mask
vertically.
Using focus and toning tools
Focus and toning tools are used to edit image brightness, contrast, and
color. Several tools for making these adjustments are contained within the
Tools panel.
Red-Eye Removal tool
The Red Eye Removal tool is used to scrub over red eye that commonly
appears when taking pictures indoor with flash.

Toning tools
The toning tools are used to refine edges on pasted content by softening
edges, sharpening up a photo in areas, and blending areas that might have
been cloned or pasted into your photos. The tools, shown in Figure 2-13,
include
 Blur tool: Scrub over an area to
blur the pixels.
 Sharpen tool: Scrub over an area
to sharpen an area.
 Smudge tool: Scrub over an area
to blend pixels.
Focus tools
Focus tools are used for making edits similar to those traditionally used in
photo darkrooms. The tools, shown in Figure 2-14, include 
 Sponge tool: Use this tool to scrub
over an area that you want to
either saturate with more color or
reduce saturation. The choices for
saturation/desaturation are found
in the Options bar.
 Dodge tool: The process of dodg-
ing in a traditional darkroom holds
back light during a print exposure
resulting in a lighter image. Use this tool to scrub over areas in a photo
that you want to lighten up.
 Burn tool: Burning has the opposite effect as dodging. Use this tool to
darken some image area.
Creating shapes
Shapes can be used to add artistic elements to photos or mask out some
areas in a photo.
Cookie Cutter tool
The Cookie Cutter tool is used to mask out areas in a photo. By default, the
Heart Cookie Cutter appears in the Tools panel. When you click and drag
this tool on a photo, all the area outside the heart shape is eliminated from
the layer. To change the Cookie Cutter shape, choose a different shape
from the drop-down list in the Options bar.
Figure 2-13: The Toning tools.
Figure 2-14: The Focus tools.

Getting to Know the Tools

Shape tools
The Shape tools, shown in Figure 2-15, are used to add different shape
objects to a photo. The tools include
 Rectangle tool: Used to draw a 
rectangle.
 Rounded Rectangle tool: Used for
rectangles with rounded corners.
 Ellipse tool: Used for drawing
elliptical shapes.
 Polygon tool: Used for drawing
polygon shapes.
 Line tool: Used for drawing lines.
 Custom Shape tool: Used for draw-
ing custom shapes from a choice
of different shapes identical to those available for the Cookie Cutter
tool. Again, you make shape choices from a drop-down list in the 
Options bar.
 Shape Selection tool: After a shape has been drawn, it appears as an
object on a photo and can be moved by clicking and dragging with 
this tool.
Viewing, navigating, and sampling tools
Individual tools are used for zooming in and out of photos, moving a photo
around the image window, and sampling color.
Eyedropper tool
The Eyedropper tool samples color and places the sample color in the
Foreground color swatch. If you press the Alt/Option key and click the
Eyedropper tool, the sampled color is placed in the Background color swatch.
Hand tool
You use this tool to move a photo around the image window.
Zoom tool
Click this tool to zoom in on a photo. Press the Alt/Option key to zoom out.

You find the same magnifying glass icon for the Zoom tool appearing in dif-
ferent dialog boxes. Whenever you see this tool icon, realize that to zoom
out you always need to press the Alt/Option key and then click the photo.
When using any of the painting tools, pressing Alt/Option gets you the
Eyedropper tool. You can click to sample color; release the Alt/Option key
and you return to the selected painting tool.
Other editing tools
Some miscellaneous tools are contained in the Tools panel to perform addi-
tional edits.
Move tool
Click and drag with this tool to move the photo on the canvas. This tool is
particularly helpful when moving layer content if you are creating layered
files. 
Crop tool
This tool is used for cropping images.
Straighten tool
Use the Straighten tool to straighten crooked images — especially crooked
scanned images.
Introducing the Automation Tools
Elements offers you some one-click
steps to improve your images. Although 
these automated tasks are not tools
per se, we list them here as tools to
simplify the message. In actuality, you
use menu commands to automate
some refinements for your photos.
To observe the automation tools avail-
able to you, click the Enhance menu
and look over the first set of com-
mands shown in Figure 2-16. The menu
commands beginning with Auto in the command name indicate that the
command has something to do with some sort of automated function.
Figure 2-16: Some automated tasks in
Elements are listed as menu commands in
the Enhance menu.

Introducing the Automation Tools
47
The automated features you find in the Enhance menu include
 Auto Smart Fix: Auto Smart Fix is used to add more contrast, adjust
brightness, and improve color with one menu choice.
 Auto Levels: The Levels adjustment is used to adjust image brightness.
Elements takes a guess at the proper brightness and automatically
boosts the white and black points in your photos to render a more pure
white and rich black.
 Auto Contrast: Use this command when contrast is flat and without any
snap.
 Auto Color Correction: Auto Color Correction is used to improve color
in images by removing colorcasts.
 Auto Sharpen: Use the Auto Sharpen command to sharpen up dull
images.
 Auto Red Eye Fix: You use this tool to remove red eye in photos. If you
have a group shot taken with flash, you can use this command to
remove red eye in all the subjects.

O
ne of the most important aspects of working with images in an editor
is navigation — knowing how to move around the image (as well as
between images) and how to use tools and menu commands to help you.
Many tools in Elements enable you to zoom in and out of images, acquire
information about your photos, and examine them in detail. In this chapter,
we talk about these tools and clue you in on the best methods to use for
viewing files in an editor.
Looking at the Image Window
The first thing you need to know about examining
an image is how to get it into the Image window.
The Image window in Full Edit mode is where your
photos are opened and ready for editing. To open
an image in Full Edit mode, you have a few options
available to you.
Like any program, Elements supports a File➪Open
command. Click the menu command and a dialog box
opens enabling you to navigate your hard drive and
select a photo. Click the Open button and the photo opens
in the Image window.
Another method for opening photos is to use the Organizer, where you
select one or more photos you want to edit. Because we’ve already covered

Looking at the Image Window
50
some of the essentials of using the Organizer in Book I, Chapter 2, let’s take
a look at opening a file from the Organizer in Full Edit mode.
1. Open the Organizer.
You can launch Photoshop Elements and click the Organize button in
the Welcome screen to open the Organizer window; or if you’re in an
edit mode now, click the Organizer button in the top right of the Editor
window.
2. Click a photo thumbnail in the Organizer window.
Following this step presumes you have some photos in the default cata-
log as we explained in Chapter 1 of this book and elaborate more on in
Book II, Chapter 1.
3. Open the Editor drop-down list and click Full Edit or press Ctrl/Ô+I.
The photo opens in the Image window, as shown in Figure 3-1.

Figure 3-1 highlights several important items when you view photos in the
Image window. Notice the following:
 Scroll bars become active when you zoom in on an image. You can click
the scroll arrows, move the Scroll bar, or grab the Hand tool in the Tools
panel and then drag within the window to move the image.
 The Magnification box shows you at a glance how much you’ve zoomed
in or out.
 The Information box shows you the readout for a particular tidbit of
information. You can choose what information you want to see in this
area by choosing one of the options from the pop-up menu, which we
discuss a bit later in this section.
When you’re working on an image
in Elements, you always want to
know the physical image size, the
image resolution, and the color
mode. (These terms are explained
in more detail in Book III, Chapters
1 and 2.) Regardless of which
menu option you choose from the
Information box, you can get a
quick glimpse at these essential
stats by clicking the Information
box, which displays a pop-up
menu like the one shown in
Figure 3-2.
 The Size box enables you to resize
the window. Move the cursor to
the box, and a diagonal line with
two opposing arrows appears.
When the cursor changes, drag in
or out to size the window smaller or larger, respectively.
You can also resize the window by dragging any of the other corners in
or out.
 Click the Minimize button (the _ button in the upper-right corner of the
image window), and the window hides from view. The window’s still
open; you just click the image in the Project Bin to maximize the window.
 If you click the Maximize button (the button with the box-shaped icon),
the Title bar shown at the top of the window disappears and provides
you with a little more room for viewing images in the window.
 You can click the Close button (it’s shaped like an X) to close the active
image window and keep Elements open. Alternatively, you can use the
keyboard shortcut Ctrl+W or choose File➪Close to close the active
window.

Figure 3-2: Click the readout on the
Information box, and a pop-up menu
shows you important information about
your file.

Looking at the Image Window
52
After you’re familiar with the overall
Image window, we want to introduce
you to the Information box’s pop-up
menu, which enables you to choose
the type of information you want to
view in the Information box. Click the
right-pointing arrow to open the menu,
as shown in Figure 3-3.
Here’s the lowdown of the options you
find on the pop-up menu:
 Document Sizes: Shows you the saved file size.
 Document Profile: Shows you the color profile used with the file. For
more on color profiles, see Book III, Chapter 3.
 Document Dimensions: Shows you the physical size in your default
unit of measure, such as inches. (Refer to Figure 3-3, which has the
Document Dimensions option selected.)
 Scratch Sizes: Displays the amount of memory on your hard drive that’s
consumed by all documents open in Elements. The scratch space is the
extension of RAM created by a space on your hard drive. For example,
20M/200M indicates that the open documents consume 20 megabytes
and that a total of 200 megabytes are available for Elements to edit your
images. When you add more content to a file, such as new layers, the
first figure grows while the second figure remains static.
 Efficiency: Indicates how many operations you’re performing in RAM as
opposed to using your scratch disk. When the number is 100%, you’re
working in RAM. When the number drops below 100%, you’re using the
scratch disk. If you continually work below 100%, it’s a good indication
that you need to buy more RAM to increase your efficiency.
 Timing: Indicates the time it took to complete the last operation.
 Current Tool: Shows the name of the tool selected from the Tools panel.
Don’t worry about trying to understand all these terms. The important
thing to know is that you can visit the pop-up menu and change the items at
will during your editing sessions.
The Image window is just one small part of the user interface in Elements.
To get the full picture, imagine that, when a photo opens in Full Edit mode
within the Elements window, you’re going to see the Image window con-
tained within the workspace as a whole, where you have access to tools,
panels, and menus to choose from a variety of edit options.
If you select multiple files in the Organizer and choose Full Edit from the
Editor drop-down list, all the photos open in the Image window. Clicking the
Figure 3-3: From the pop-up menu on the 
Information box, you select commands that 
provide information about your file.

Minimize button on several photos tucks them into the Photo Bin. In the work-
space interface, you see something like Figure 3-4 when a photo is opened in
the Image window and several other open photos appear in the Photo Bin.

Zooming In and Out of Image Windows
Precision goes a long way when making good edits on photos. When you are
working carefully on image detail, zoom in on any part of a picture where
you want to (carefully) apply some fine-tuning. Nothing looks worse than
photos with obvious edits that were clumsily done without precision.

Zooming with keyboard shortcuts
For some quick zooms in and out of photos, you can use keyboard short-
cuts. Here are a few to keep in mind when you need to quickly change the
zoom level:
 Ctrl/Ô+: Press the Ctrl/Ô and the plus (+) key on your keyboard and
you zoom in on a photo. Keep pressing the same keys to continue
zooming in. By default, when you press these keys, the photo and the
Image window zoom together.
 Ctrl/Ô–: Press Ctrl/Ô and the minus (–) key and you zoom out. Again,
the Image window zooms along with the photo.
 Ctrl/Ô+Alt/Option+: Press both the Ctrl/Ô and Alt/Option keys and
then press the plus(+) key. The photo zooms in, but the Image window
stays fixed at one size.
 Ctrl/Ô+Alt/Option–: Press both the Ctrl/Ô and Alt/Option keys and
then press the minus (–) key. The photo zooms out, but the Image
window stays fixed at one size.
 Ctrl/Ô+0: Press Ctrl/Ô+0 (the zero key) and the photo zooms to fit the
Image window.
 Ctrl/Ô+spacebar: This combination temporarily activates the Zoom In
tool.
 Ctrl/Ô+Alt/Option+spacebar: This combination temporarily activates
the Zoom Out tool.
Using the Zoom tool
The Zoom tool is used to zoom in and out of the Image window. You first
click to select the Zoom tool in the Tools panel and then click the photo to
zoom in. (To zoom out, press the Alt/Option key when clicking the Zoom
tool on the photo.) 
While working on an image using another tool from the Tools panel, you
can temporarily access the Zoom tool without clicking it in the Tools panel.
Press Ctrl/Ô+spacebar and the cursor changes to the Zoom In tool. To
zoom out, press Ctrl/Ô+Alt+spacebar. When you release the keys on the
keyboard, you are returned to the tool last selected in the Tools panel.
When you select the Zoom tool in the Tools panel, the Options bar changes
to reflect choices you can make when zooming views as shown in Figure 3-5.

Zooming In and Out of Image Windows

Figure 3-5: Click the Zoom tool, and the Options bar changes to 
provide more options when using the tool to zoom views.
The tools available in the Zoom tool Options bar include
 +/–: The plus and minus icons are used to zoom in and out of a photo in
the Image window. Click one of the icons to zoom in or out.
 Percent readout: The number appearing in the text box can be edited
to zoom to a percent size. Click the down-pointing arrow to open a drop-
down list where you can select from fixed zoom percentages.
 Resize Window to Fit: When you click the check box, the zoom resizes
the window to the size of the image or the maximum size to the window.
 Zoom All Windows: If you have multiple photos open in the Image
window, all photos are zoomed together when you zoom views.
 1:1. The ratio is reported in this text box. When the photo is shown
at 100% size, the ratio reads 1:1. The ratio changes as you change the
zoom views.
 Fit Screen: Click the button and the photo zooms to the maximum view
to fit the Image window.
 Print Size: Click this button and the photo zooms to the size the file will
be when printed. 
Moving the Hand tool
When you zoom in to a size larger than the Image window can accommo-
date, you see scroll bars appearing on the bottom and right side of the
photo. You can click and drag scroll bars to see more of the image area, or
you can use the Hand tool to drag the image around the Image window. 
While working with other tools from the Tools panel, you can temporarily
access the Hand tool by pressing the spacebar. Press the spacebar and drag
the image; then release the spacebar and you return to the last tool selected
in the Tools panel.
If you are typing text on an image, you cannot use the spacebar to temporar-
ily access the Hand tool. To move the Image window when typing text, click
the Hand tool in the Tools panel and move the photo. Click the Type tool
in the Tools panel, click in the text block you started, and continue typing.

Cruising with the Navigator Panel
The Navigator panel is a handy tool to keep open when you need to zoom
in and out of a photo while editing images. All zooming can be performed in
this panel — and you can keep it open during your editing session!
To open the Navigator panel, choose
Window➪Navigator. The panel opens
as a floating panel, as shown in 
Figure 3-6.
In the top-left corner you see a readout
displaying the current zoom percent-
age. At the top right of the panel is a
slider that you can move left to zoom
out of a photo and right to zoom in on
a photo. In the center of the panel, you
see a view displaying the entire image
and a red rectangle displaying the area
corresponding to the zoom view in the Image window.
The rectangle in the center of the panel can be moved around the Navigator
panel just as you use the Hand tool to move around an image. The lower-right
corner is dragged out or in to size the panel larger or smaller, respectively.
Click the right arrow adjacent to More to open a fly-out menu. From the
menu commands, you can choose Place Palette in Palette Bin When Closed.
When you make the selection and click the X in the top-right corner, the
Navigator panel docks in the Palette Bin.
You can quickly resize the zoom area in the Navigator panel by pressing the
Ctrl/Ô key and drawing a rectangle around the area you want to zoom.
Using the Grids and Guides
Grids and guides are helpful when you add text to a photo, when working
with layers, and when working with selections. You can align content to
guidelines for precise alignment. In addition, you can display rulers along
the left and top sides of a photo.
To view the grid and guidelines, choose View➪Grid. A nonprinting grid
appears in your photo, like the one shown in Figure 3-7. To display rulers,
choose View➪Rulers.
Figure 3-6: The Navigator panel opened
as a floating panel in the Image window.

Using the Info Palette

Figure 3-7: To show a grid and rulers, choose the appropriate options from the View menu. 
To snap layers and objects to the grid and guides, choose View➪Snap To.
From the submenu you can choose Guides and Grid. When the items are
enabled, dragging objects, creating selections, and moving content on layers
snap to the items you select from the Snap To submenu.
Using the Info Palette
The Info palette provides some feedback related to the cursor position and
color information as you move the cursor around a photo. In addition, you
can quickly examine the file size and other document information in the
palette.
To open the palette, choose Window➪Info. The palette opens as a floating
palette, as shown in Figure 3-8.
When you open the More fly-out menu and choose Palette Options from the
menu, the Info Palette Options dialog box opens. Here you can make some
adjustments for the kind of information you want reported in the palette, as
shown in Figure 3-9.

Working with Your Content
The Content panel provides you with a wealth of opportunity to change
backgrounds on images, add photo frames, graphics, text, and shapes. You
have a number of choices for the types of items you want to add to a photo
(see Figure 3-10), as well as a list of categories you can apply, such as back-
grounds, frames, graphics, shapes, and so on.
Figure 3-10: A number of different types can be applied as shapes, 
graphics, backgrounds, and frames.
To see how this works, assume you want to use one of the backgrounds
Elements provides you in the Content panel. Follow these steps to begin an
editing session:
1. Create a new blank document.
Open Full Edit mode and choose File➪New➪Blank File.
2. Set the file attributes.
When the New dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 3-11, choose a
width and height for the file size. In our example, we use 445 x 284
pixels. Choose a resolution by typing a value in the Resolution text box.
For a demonstration, we use 72 ppi (pixels per inch). Select RGB Color
for the color mode and leave the background at the default setting of
Transparent.

7. Apply the background. 
Click the Apply button in the
lower-right corner of the Content
panel. The new background image
is applied to the background.
A banner across the top-right corner of
an item in the Contents panel lets you
know that the content is available on
Photoshop.com. You need to log in to
Photoshop.com in order to make use
of the items marked with such a
banner. For more information on set-
ting up a Photoshop.com account and
logging on, see Book I, Chapter 1.
After you have a background in place,
you may want to copy and paste an
image into your document, add text,
create multiple layers of images that
you organize into a design, or other tasks. To effectively add images to the
background you need to know a bit about working with layers (covered in
Book VI, Chapter 1) and working with selection masks (covered in Book VI,
Chapter 4).
In Figure 3-13, we added a photo to a background we selected from the
backgrounds in the Content panel. For this type of look, we needed to

 Understanding preferences
 Adjusting the Full Edit mode preferences
 Adjusting the Organizer preferences
P
hotoshop Elements is a program that accommodates a wide range of
photographers with a wide range of needs. Not every individual who
works in the program is likely to work the same way or use the same tools
consistently. When you think of all the creative options you have for editing
photos and then consider your hardware advantages and limitations, you
can begin to design a personal working environment.
Elements understands a user’s need to tailor the program to his or her spe-
cific needs. That’s why it provides you with some methods for creating your
personal work environment through a set of Preferences you can adjust to
your personal work style.
Understanding Preferences
A Preference setting is an adjustment in a Preferences
dialog box that has some sort of effect on edits you
make on pictures, on the behavior of tools, menus,
and on the controls that affect Elements. 
When you make a choice in a Preferences dialog
box, the new setting takes effect after the adjust-
ment is made and remains intact until you make a
change in the Preferences dialog box. Most prefer-
ences adjustments you make are dynamic — meaning
that the change in a setting takes place immediately
after you click the OK button in the dialog box. In some
cases, preference settings are not dynamic — meaning you
must quit Photoshop Elements and relaunch the program for
the new setting to take effect.

Setting Full Edit Mode Preferences
64
Preferences are adjusted separately in different dialog boxes for the Editors
and another dialog box for the Organizer. Whether you use Photoshop
Elements or any other computer program, it’s a good idea to review the
preferences available to you when you first begin working with it. In
Elements, you want to review and understand all the preference options
you have in Full Edit mode and in the Organizer.
Setting Full Edit Mode Preferences
Preferences are all contained in the nine panes of the Preferences dialog
box. By default, when you open Full Edit mode and open the Preferences
dialog box, the opening pane is the General pane. To open the Preferences
dialog box, choose Edit➪Preferences➪General. Alternatively, press Ctrl+K.
Using either method opens the Preferences dialog box to the General pane,
as shown in Figure 4-1.
In Figure 4-1, you see items that are
common to all preference panes.
Here’s a quick introduction to what
these items are and how they work:
 Panes list: Elements lists all the
different panes in the Preferences
dialog box along the left side of
the dialog box. Click an item in the
list to make the respective pane
open on the right side of the
dialog box. In earlier versions of
Elements, you used a drop-down menu to select the different panes.
 OK: Click the OK button to accept any changes made in any pane.
 Cancel: Click Cancel to return to the settings that were in effect when
you opened a pane. If you hold down the Alt key, the Cancel button
changes to Reset, and clicking that button performs the same action as
clicking the Reset button.
 Reset: If you change any settings options, click OK. If you then change
your mind, just click Reset. This action takes you back to the settings in
effect when you opened the Preferences dialog box.
 Prev: Switch to the previous pane.
 Next: Switch to the next pane. You can also press Ctrl+(1 through 9
keys) to jump to another pane.
Figure 4-1: The General pane in the
Preferences dialog box.

Setting Full Edit Mode Preferences
65
Setting General preferences
The first pane you see when you open the Preferences dialog box is the
General preferences. In the General preferences pane on the right side of the
dialog box, you see many check boxes that relate to a variety of behaviors
for tools and the Elements user interface. The items in this pane (reading
left to right) include
 Color Picker: From the menu list, you can choose the Adobe color
picker or your system color picker.
 Step Back/Fwd: The default keyboard shortcuts for stepping back is
Ctrl/cmd+Z. To step forward the default is CTRL/cmd+Y. You can change
the shortcuts by choosing other options from the drop-down list.
 Export Clipboard: When you copy image content in Elements to the
Clipboard, you can make the content available for other applications by
checking this box. 
 Save Palette Locations: You may want to move panels to new perma-
nent locations around the Editor workspace. If this check box is not
checked, the panels revert to the default locations each time you
reopen the program. If the check box is checked, the panels remain
in their new position when you open the Editor.
 Show Tool Tips: Check this box to show tooltips.
 Use Shift Key for Tool Switch: When you press the M key on your key-
board, you activate the Rectangular Marquee tool. Press M again and
you select the Elliptical Marquee tool. If this check box is checked, you
press the Shift key to switch tools while pressing the keystrokes.
 Zoom Resizes Windows: When you zoom in on a picture, the photo
zooms while the Image window remains fixed in size. If you want the
window to zoom when the picture is zoomed, check this box.
 Center Document Windows: Check this box to center images in the
Image window.
 Beep When Done: Check this box to play an audio sound when an edit
is finished.
 Relaxed Text Selection: Clicking near text selects the text.
 Select Move Tool after Committing Text: When you type text, the Type
tool is active when you complete your editing. If you want the Move tool
selected after adding text, check this box.
 Project Bin Auto-Hide: When you check this box, the Project Bin is
hidden. You can click Show Project Bin at the bottom of the Elements
Book I
Chapter 4
Setting Your

window to display the Project Bin. When you move the cursor to the
Image window and click, the Project Bin hides automatically.
 Zoom with Scroll Wheel: Check this box if you have a mouse with a
scroll wheel and want to zoom in and out when rotating the wheel.
 User Interface Brightness: Moving this slider changes the brightness
on your monitor for the Photoshop Elements user interface items. 
 Reset All Warning Dialogs: Many warning dialog boxes have check
boxes in them which, if checked, let you dismiss the dialog box safe in
the knowledge that you’ll never have to bother with that particular
dialog box again. If, however, you change your mind and want that
dialog box popping up again, check this box to reset the dialogs
to defaults.
Setting Saving Files preferences
The Saving Files preferences, shown in
Figure 4-2, relate to options available
for saving files. The settings you have
available include
 On First Save: From a drop-down
list you can choose Always Ask,
Ask If Original, Save Over Current
file. These options apply to the
first time you edit a photo.
 Image Previews: Image Previews
show you thumbnail previews of images. Adding a preview increases
file size. You can choose to Never Save, Always Save, or Ask When
Saving.
 File Extension: Filename extensions can be upper or lowercase.
 Prefer Adobe Camera Raw for Supported Raw Files: For Camera Raw
formats supported by Adobe Camera Raw, you can use Adobe Camera
Raw as a default. 
 Ignore Camera Data (EXIF) Profiles: Camera data can be added as
metadata for photos for cameras that save the data. You can choose to
keep the data or discard it.
 Maximum PSD File Compatibility: When you save files from Elements
you can save in a format compatible with Adobe Photoshop. For larger
files you may want to eliminate the compatibility to reduce the overall
file size.
 Recent file list contains ___ files: The File➪Open Recently Edited File
submenu lists ten files by default. You can reduce the number of files
appearing in the list (as low as zero) or increase the number to a maxi-
mum of 30 files.
Figure 4-2: The Saving Files preferences.

Setting Full Edit Mode Preferences

Setting Performance preferences
Check out the Performance
Preferences pane, shown in Figure 4-3,
for history states and memory set-
tings, such as scratch disk settings.
(See the sidebar “What’s a scratch
disk?” in this chapter for more on
scratch disks.) The options include
 Let Photoshop Elements Use: This
item deals with the amount of
memory allocated to Elements.
You can type values in the text box to change the memory allocation.
 History States: You can undo edits up to 50 undos, defined in the
History States text box by default. This value can be edited to add more
undos or to reduce the number. The more you add to the text box, the
more memory required in Elements.
 Cache Levels: Some operations you perform are cached in memory so
that they can be quickly accessed again. You can edit the check box to
increase or decrease the cache levels. 
 Scratch Disks: If you have external hard drives attached to your com-
puter, you can extend the scratch disk space to external drives.
Don’t use USB 1.1 external hard drives or other drives that have connec-
tions slower than USB 2 or FireWire. Using slower drives slows the perform-
ance of Elements.
Setting Display & Cursors preferences
The Display & Cursors preferences are
shown in Figure 4-4. These choices
offer options for how certain tool cur-
sors are displayed and how you view
the Crop tool when you’re cropping
images.
Your choices include
 Show Transition Effects: When
the check box is checked you see
transition effects when viewing
photos in a slideshow.
 Painting Cursors: Your choices here include the following:
• Standard: This setting shows a tool icon, such as the Lasso tool or
the Brush tool, for when you are editing an image. 
Book I

• Precise: This setting changes the tool cursor to a crosshair for pre-
cise markings.
• Normal Brush Tip: Displays a 50% tip on a brush for the cursor shape.
• Full Size Brush Tip: Shows the tool cursor at the full size of a brush tip.
• Show Crosshair in Brush Tip: Shows the tool cursor with a crosshair
inside the tip.
 Crop Tool settings: The following Crop Tool options are found in this
section:
• Use Shield: If you check this option and then use the Crop tool, the
inside area defining the crop region shows the photo at the normal
appearance and the area outside the crop region appears with a
shield, making it easier to see what will be eliminated and what will
be retained when the photo is cropped.
• Shield Color: You can change the color of the Crop tool shield by
making choices in the drop-down color palette.
• Opacity: The shield is semitransparent by default. You can change
the opacity of the shield to make it more opaque or transparent by
editing the text box or choosing options from the drop-down list.
Setting Transparency preferences
The Transparency preferences are shown in Figure 4-5. Using these settings
requires an understanding of how Elements represents transparency.
Imagine painting a portrait on a piece of clear acetate. The area you paint is
opaque, and the area surrounding the portrait is transparent — invisible, in
other words. To display transparency in Elements, you need some method to
make transparent areas visible. To accomplish that, open the Transparency
preferences and make choices for how transparency is displayed in your 2-D
Elements environment.
What’s a scratch disk?
Assume that you have 100 megabytes (MB) of
free RAM (your internal computer memory) and
you want to work on a picture that consumes
200MB of hard disk space. Elements needs to
load all 200MB of the file into RAM. Therefore,
an auxiliary source of RAM is needed in order
for you to work on the image; Elements uses
your hard drive. When a hard drive is used as
an extension of RAM, this source is a scratch
disk.
If you have more than one hard drive connected
to your computer, you can instruct Elements to
use all hard drives, and you can select the order
of the hard drives that Elements uses for your
extension of RAM. All disks and media sources
appear in a list as 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on.

Setting Full Edit Mode Preferences
69
The settings available to you include
 Grid Size: The grid you see in the
image in the top-right corner of the
Transparency preferences pane
displays the default settings for
the grid size and color. You can
change the grid size to None,
Small, Medium, or Large.
 Grid Colors: From the drop-down
list, you can choose from preset colors to display the transparency.
 First transparency background color: Click the swatch and you can
make a custom color choice for one set of the pattern squares.
 Second transparency background color: Click the second color swatch
and you can choose a custom color for the second set of pattern squares.
Units & Rulers
The Units & Rulers preferences shown
in Figure 4-6 let you specify settings 
for ruler units, column guides, and
document preset resolutions. Your
choices include
 Rulers: From the drop-down list,
choose the unit of measure you
want to use for your display.
 Type: From the drop-down list,
choose the units you want to use
when dealing with text.
 Print Sizes: From the drop-down list, choose the units you want to work
with when printing photos.
 Width: You can set up columns to create a layout in Elements. This item
deals with the width you want to specify for the column width.
 Gutter: The gutter is normally the space between columns in a publica-
tion. Define the amount of space you want to have appear between the
columns when you add columns to a layout.
 Print Resolution: When you create a new document, the print resolu-
tion default is determined by this setting. 
 Screen Resolution: A new document’s screen resolution is determined
by this setting.
 Photo Project Units: When creating projects such as photo calendars,
photo books, and so on, you can specify units of measure for the book
sizes from choices in the drop-down list.

Setting Grid preferences
The Grid preferences shown in Figure
4-7 offer options for gridline color, 
divisions, and subdivisions. A grid
shows you nonprinting horizontal and
vertical lines. You use a grid to align
objects, type, and other elements. You
can snap items to the gridlines to
make aligning objects much easier.
Your choices for Grid preferences
include
 Color: Grids are displayed with colored lines. You can change line color
by choosing Custom or a preset color from the drop-down list.
 Style: Lines can be regular lines, dashed lines, or dots. Make your choice
by selecting an option from the drop-down list.
 Guideline every ____ inches: Major guideline divisions can be spaced
according to a value you type in the text box.
 Subdivisions: Between each major subdivision, you can define the
number of subdivision lines by typing a value in the text box.
Setting Plug-ins preferences
The Plug-ins Preferences pane, shown
in Figure 4-8, isn’t much to look at. It
contains a single option for selecting
an additional plug-ins folder for storing
third-party utilities to work with
Elements. If you have third-party utili-
ties, though, it’s a great help. Just
check the check box and click the
Choose button to locate another folder
for storing your third-party plug-ins.
Setting Type preferences
The Type preferences shown in Figure 4-9 provide options for setting text
attributes. You have options for using different quote marks, showing Asian
character options, showing font names in English, and previewing font
sizes. The full listing follows:
 Use Smart Quotes: So-called smart quotes — the typographically correct
quotation marks found in most printed matter — are used instead of
straight quotes when this option is checked.

for Small, Medium, Large, Extra Large, and Huge.
Setting Up the Organizing Environment
A whole different set of Preferences appears when you open the Organizer
and choose Edit➪Preferences or press Ctrl/Ô+K. Initially, you may be con-
fused because the dialog box that opens when you work in the Organizer is
also named Preferences. However, a quick glance at the dialog box shows
you a different set of Preferences choices. 
Open the Organizer and press Ctrl+K
to open the Preferences dialog box
shown in Figure 4-10.
Some items common to all panes in the
Organizer Preferences include
 Restore Default Settings: This

 Preview File Size: From the drop-down list, you can choose different
preview resolutions. A preview is created when you double-click a
photo in the Organizer.
Setting Folder Location View preferences
The Folder Location View preferences
shown in Figure 4-12 provide options
for showing files and folders in groups
and selected folders. Basically, you 
can choose between the following two
options:
 All Files Grouped by Folder:
Shows all files in the Organizer
sorted by folder.
 Only Files in the Selected Folder:
Displays only those files in a speci-
fied folder in the Organizer
window.
Setting Editing preferences
It is possible that you may have another editing application that has
some features not found in Elements. With the Editing preferences shown in

another editor, such as Microsoft
Media Maker. Click the check box and
then click the Browse button to select
another editor.
Setting Camera or Card
Reader preferences
The Camera and Card Reader prefer-
ences shown in Figure 4-14 handle how
you acquire images from digital cam-
eras and media storage cards. Your
computer may have built-in card read-
ers in which you can insert a media
card, such as CompactFlash or Smart
Media, or a USB card reader that sup-
ports a media card. You may have 
a cable that connects from your
camera to a USB port on your com-
puter. These preference options are
used with media cards, camera con-
nections, and download options.
The options include
 Save Files In/Browse: The directory where files are saved by default
appears listed in the Camera or Card Reader preferences. Click the
Browse button to choose another folder for the default location.
 Automatically Fix Red Eyes: As files are imported, red-eye removal is
performed when the check box is enabled.
 Automatically Suggest Photo Stacks: Photos appearing similar in image
content can be stacked to minimize the space in the Organizer window.
When this check box is enabled, Elements prompts you with sugges-
tions for stacking the photos.
 Make ‘Group Custom Name’ a Keyword Tag: For custom group names
of photo collections, you can have a Keyword tag added to the Keyword
Tags panel.

A
fter you install Photoshop Elements, the first thing
you want to do is open some photos. It stands to
reason that, before you can jump into all the editing
opportunities you have with the program, you need
to have something to work with.
You may have digital camera photos still on a
memory card, or you may have copied files to your
computer. You might have a photo print you want
to scan, or you may want to get a photo off your cell
phone. Regardless of where you have photos stored,
you want to get them into Elements and start working
on them.
In this chapter, we talk about getting your files into the
Organizer and opening them in an editor. After you have your files
in one workspace or another, you have a number of different options for
sorting, finding, and arranging photos in the Organizer. First, however, we

Getting Images from Your Camera
82
look at acquiring images from a variety of sources and check out how to
open them in an editor. (Look over Book I, Chapter 1 if you just can’t wait to
find out more on working with the Organizer.)
Getting Images from Your Camera
When you work with Elements, you most frequently use one of two work-
spaces, as we described in Book 1, Chapter 1 — the Organizer or the Editor.
The Organizer is frequently used as your first stop in editing photos. Unless
you have an image you want to edit in Full Edit mode and, therefore, open it
immediately in the Editor, your typical first step is to look over a collection
of photos you’ve taken with a digital camera or imported using a scanner.
Therefore, when we talk about getting images from your camera, we’re
pointing you to the Organizer workspace.
To load up images from your camera in the Organizer window, you open the
Organizer and use a cable connected to your camera and your computer.
Most digital cameras come with USB cables that can be connected to both
camera and computer.
The process for acquiring images from a camera and a card reader are the
same, and the Organizer has a single menu command you use to acquire 
your photos. To find out how to acquire the images, look over the next 
section. 
Getting Images from Your Card Reader
Almost all cameras use memory cards to store photos. After shooting some
images, you have a choice of either grabbing those images directly from the
camera and shunting them to your computer via a USB or FireWire cable, or
you can remove the memory card itself from the camera and place it in a
card reader hooked up to your computer using one of the same cables.
Both methods — a direct hookup or a connection to a card reader — afford
you an opportunity to load your photos in the Elements Organizer. To add
photos to the Organizer do the following:

Getting Images from Your Card Reader
83
1. Either hook up your camera to your computer via a USB/FireWire
cable, or hook up a card reader via a cable and insert the memory
card in the reader.
Use the cable supported by your camera/card reader.
2. Cancel the AutoPlay wizard.
When you hook up your camera or card reader, the AutoPlay wizard
opens. Click Cancel in the wizard to proceed.
3. Open the Organizer.
Launch Photoshop Elements and click Organize in the Welcome screen.
4. Get photos from the camera/card reader.
In the Organizer, choose File➪Get Photos and Video➪From Camera or
Card Reader or press Ctrl+G.
5. Choose the media source.
The first wizard you see when you
choose the menu command is the
Adobe Photoshop Elements 7.0
Downloader. This wizard opens
when you choose to get photos
from within the Organizer. At the
top of the wizard you find a drop-
down list that displays your hard
drives and a source such as a
camera or card reader attached to
your computer. Choose a source,
as shown in Figure 1-1.
6. Get the photos.
After you choose a camera or card
reader, the Photoshop Elements
7.0 – Photo Downloader appears
with the Get Photos button active,
as shown in Figure 1-2. Click Get
Photos and leave the other set-
tings at the defaults.

7. Wait for the downloader to com-
plete downloading all images
before continuing.
A progress bar displays the down-
load progress, as shown in Figure
1-3. If you have many photos on
your memory card, it may take a
little time to complete the down-
load. Be patient and wait for the
download to finish.
8. Import the photos.
A dialog box opens, as shown in
Figure 1-4, when the download is
complete. The download does not
copy images to the Organizer. To
import the copied images into the
Organizer, click OK.
9. View the results.
After the photos have been
imported in the Organizer, you see thumbnail images for all the photos
acquired from the memory card, as shown in Figure 1-5.

Using the Photoshop Elements Downloader
85
After the photos are added to the Organizer, you can edit the images in Full
Edit or Quick Fix mode. See “Opening an Image in Full Edit Mode,” later in
this chapter.
Using the Photoshop Elements Downloader
The Adobe Photoshop Elements 7.0 – Photo Downloader wizard (refer to
Figure 1-5) has a number of settings you can use when getting photos from a
media source. Among the options you have are
 Location: Click the Browse button to navigate your hard drive and
select a target folder for saving the downloaded files. The directory path
is shown in the wizard. In the advanced options shown later in Figure
1-6 you can create subfolders to further organize your photos.
 Rename files: You can choose to preserve the filenames created by your
camera or add an extension or custom name for the files. Open the drop-
down list and make a choice for the naming convention you want to use.
 Delete options: You can copy images to your hard drive and retain the
files on the media card, or you can delete the files after copying them.
Choose an option from the drop-down list.
 Automatic Download: If you check this box, the Adobe Photoshop
Elements 7.0 – Photo Downloader wizard automatically downloads
images when a media card is inserted in a card reader or when your
camera is connected to your computer. You can establish download
options from the Organizer preferences (see Book I, Chapter 4 for more
on customizing preferences).
 Advanced Dialog: Click this
button to open the Advanced
dialog box (shown in Figure 1-6)
where you find more settings you
can adjust when getting images
from a camera or card reader.
Options you have in the Advanced
dialog box include
 Save Options: These options
mirror (for the most part) what
you see in the standard Photoshop

 Advanced Options: If it’s in the Advanced Options section of the
Advanced dialog box, it must be doubly advanced, right? Items listed
here include
• Automatically Fix Red Eyes: Red-eye removal is applied to all images
where Elements detects a red-eye problem.
• Automatically Suggest Photo Stacks: Images with similar content can
be stacked so only a single-image thumbnail appears in the
Organizer. You can unstack the photos at any time by clicking a
stacked group. Checking this box automatically suggests photo
stacks that you can confirm or deny.
• Make ‘Group Custom Name’ a Tag: Photos can be tagged for sorting
and organizing purposes. Checking this box adds a tag to the photos
based on the group of photos imported.
• Import into Album: You can import a number of images into an exist-
ing Photo Album by checking this box.
 Apply Metadata: Metadata is information added to photos. Your
camera can add metadata such as F-stop, date the shot was taken, ISO
rating, and much more. You also have some custom options for adding
metadata such as
• Template to Use: Choose Basic Metadata for the template from the
drop-down list and the other items in this group become active.
• Creator: This is an open text field you can use to add something like
a photographer’s name.
• Copyright: Another open text field where you can add the name of
the copyright holder such as a photo studio or a client.
 Check All: The button at the bottom of the dialog box is used to check
all the images. When checked, all images are copied from the media
card to your hard drive.
 Uncheck All: Check this box and you can individually check the box
adjacent to the lower-right corner of each photo thumbnail. Only the
checked items are copied to your hard drive when you click Get Photos.
Using the AutoPlay Wizard
Earlier in this chapter, we cancelled the AutoPlay wizard when we added
photos in the Organizer. At times, you may want to use the AutoPlay wizard
to copy files to your computer.

Scanning Images
87
To use the AutoPlay wizard, connect
your camera or card reader to your
computer or insert a CD-ROM. The
AutoPlay wizard opens by default. In
the AutoPlay wizard shown in Figure
1-7, you have the following options:
 Pictures Options: In the list below
Pictures Options, you find applica-
tions that can open images on the
stored media device. If you want to
open files in Photoshop Elements
7, click the Organize and Edit link
adjacent to the Elements 7 icon.
 General Options: If you want to
browse the media storage device,
click the Open Folder to View Files
link. The folder where your images
are stored opens on the desktop.
You can copy folders and images to
your hard drive by dragging them
from the media device to a folder on
your hard drive.
Scanning Images
Scanners connect through the same ports as cameras and card readers.
Most of today’s scanners use either USB or FireWire. Almost all low-end
scanners sold now are USB devices.
Even the lowest-end scanners provide 16-bit scans that help you get a little
more data in the shadows and highlights. Like a digital camera, a scanner’s
price is normally in proportion to its quality.
Preparing before you scan
Just as you’d clean a lens on a digital camera and set various menu selec-
tions before clicking the shutter button, you should prepare a few things
ahead of time before scanning:
 Connect the scanner properly. Make sure that you have all connections
made to your computer according to the user manual that came with
your scanner. If you just purchased a scanner, check for any lock bolts
or tape and remove them according to the instructions.

Figure 1-7: Connect a camera or card
reader or insert a CD-ROM and the
AutoPlay wizard opens.

Scanning Images
88
 Clean the scanner platen. Use a lint-free cloth and some glass cleaner
(applied to the cloth) to remove all dust and particles on the glass. The
more dust particles you remove, the easier the job of editing your
image in Elements.
 Clean the source material. Be certain that the print or film you want to
scan is free of dust and spots.
If you have old negatives that are dirty or that have water spots or
debris that you can’t remove with a cloth and film cleaner, soak the film
in photo flo (a liquid you can purchase at a photo retailer). Be certain
that your hands are clean and then run the filmstrip between two fin-
gers to remove the excess liquid. Turn on your shower full force with
hot water only and hang film nearby to dry it. Remove the film when it’s
dry, and you should see a surprisingly clean filmstrip compared to your
soiled original.
 Get to know your scanner software. When you scan in Elements, the
software supplied with your scanner takes charge, and you use the
options in this software before the image scan finally drops into an
Elements Image window.
 Prepare the artwork. If you plan on scanning pages in a book or pam-
phlet, remove the pages or try to make photocopies so that the piece
you scan lies flat on the scanner platen. Make sure that you observe
copyright laws if you’re scanning printed works. For faxes and photo-
copies, try to improve originals by recopying them on a photocopier by
using darker settings.
 Find the scanner’s sweet spot. Every scanner has an area where you
can acquire the best scans. This area is often called the sweet spot. To
find the scanner’s sweet spot, scan a blank piece of paper. The sweet
spot is the brightest area on the resultant scan. Other areas should be
darker. The sweet spot is most often in the upper-left quadrant, the
lower-right quadrant, or the middle of the page. Note the area and plan
to place your source material within this area when scanning pictures.
Understanding image requirements
All scanning software provides you with options for determining resolution
and color mode before you start a new scan. You should decide what output
you intend to use and scan originals at target resolutions designed to
accommodate a given output. For example
 Scan the artwork or photo at the size and resolution for the final
output. If you have a 3-x-5 photo that needs to be 1.5 x 2.5 inches on a
Web page, scan the original with a 50-percent reduction in size at 72 ppi.
(See Book III, Chapter 1 for information about resizing images.)

Scanning Images
89
 Size images with the scanner software. If you have a 4-x-6 photo that
needs to be output for prepress and commercial printing at 8 x 12
inches, scan the photo at 4 x 6 inches at 600 ppi (enough to size to 200
percent for a 300 dpi image).
 Scan properly for line art. Line art is 1-bit black and white only —
something like a black-and-white illustration. When you print line art on
laser printers or prepare files for commercial printing, the line art reso-
lution should match the device resolution. For example, printing to a
600 dpi (dots per inch) laser printer requires 600 ppi for a 1-bit line-art
image. When you’re printing to an image setter at a print shop, or it’s
going directly to plate or press, the resolution should be 1200 dpi.
 Scan grayscale images in color. In some cases, it doesn’t matter, but
with some images and scanners, you can get better results by scanning
in RGB (red, green, and blue) color and converting to grayscale by using
the Hue/Saturation dialog box or the Convert to Black and White dialog
box, as we explain in Book III, Chapter 2.
 Scan in high bit depths. If your scanner is capable of scanning in 16 or
32 bit, by all means, scan at the higher bit depths to capture the most
data. See Book III, Chapter 2 for more information about working with
higher-bit images.
Using scanner plug-ins
Generally, when you install your scanner software, a standalone application
and a plug-in are installed to control the scanning process. Plug-ins are
designed to work inside other software programs such as Photoshop
Elements. When you’re using the plug-in, you can stay right in Elements to
do all your scanning. Here’s how it works:
1. After installing a new scanner and the accompanying software, launch
Elements and then open the Organizer by clicking Organize in the
Welcome screen.
2. From the Organizer, open the Preferences dialog box by pressing
Ctrl/Ô+K.
3. Click Scanner in the left column and adjust the Scanner preferences,
as we describe in Book I, Chapter 4.
When the Preferences dialog box sees your scanner, you know that the con-
nection is properly set up and you’re ready to scan. Here’s how to complete
your scan:
1. To open the scanner software from within Elements, choose File➪
Get Photos➪From Scanner.
You must be in the Organizer window to access this menu command.

Images

Scanning Images

Elements may churn a bit, but eventually your scanner software
appears atop the Organizer window, as you can see in Figure 1-8. The
window is the scanner software provided by your scanner manufac-
turer. (Your window looks different from the one in Figure 1-8 unless you
use the same scanner we use.) Regardless of which software you use,
you should have similar options for creating a preview; selecting resolu-
tion, color mode, and image size; scaling; and other options.
Figure 1-8: When you scan from within Elements, your scanner 
software loads on top of the Elements workspace.
2. Adjust the options according to your output requirements and the
recommendations made by your scanner manufacturer.
3. When everything is ready to go, click the Scan button.
The final image drops into an Elements Image window.
Scanning many photos at a time
If you have several photos to scan, you can lay them out on the scanner
platen and perform a single scan to acquire all images in one pass. Arrange
the photos to scan on the glass and set up all the options in the scanner
window for your intended output. When you scan multiple images, they
form a single scan, as you can see in Figure 1-9.
After you scan multiple images, Elements makes it easy for you to separate
each image into its own Image window, where you can save the images as
separate files. Choose Image➪Divide Scanned Photos to make Elements

magically open each image in a separate window while your original scan
remains intact. The images are neatly tucked away in the Photo Bin where
you can select them for editing, as shown in Figure 1-10.
Figure 1-9: You can scan multiple images with one pass.
Using WIA-compliant scanners (Windows only)
Photoshop Elements supports using Windows Imaging Architecture (WIA)
cameras and scanners. With a WIA camera or scanner, you import images
using a number of presets you can choose beforehand. (The neat thing 
here is that you can always modify presets to suit your own image import
needs if you like.) For example, you may want to scan all grayscale images

at 600 ppi, then start Elements after a scan has completed using the scanner
software, and then set up the color management for the scanned image,
adjust brightness and contrast controls, and more. Whatever settings you
come up with can then be applied each time you perform a scan. Similar
options are available when acquiring photos with WIA-supported cameras.
Figure 1-10: After you choose Image➪Divide Scanned Photos, the scan is split into separate
Image windows.
To use the settings you must have a
WIA-compliant device. Choose File➪
Import➪WIA Support and the WIA
Support dialog box opens. By default,
images acquired are opened in
Elements, and subfolders are created
using the current date from your
system clock, as shown in Figure 1-11.
Figure 1-11: Choose File➪Import➪WIA
Support to open the WIA Support 
dialog box.

Click Start and the Select Device dialog
box opens. All the WIA-supported
devices connected to your computer
appear listed in the dialog box, as
shown in Figure 1-12. If you don’t see a
device in the dialog box, you don’t
have a supported device connected to
your computer or your device is not
properly connected.
With scanners, you typically have scan-
ning software apart from the plug-ins
added to Elements. Some scanners
have buttons on the scanning device
that perform a scan without launching
an application. You can choose to click
a button on your scanner to scan a pic-
ture and have Elements automatically
launch when the scan is completed.
The scan then opens in Full Edit mode.
To configure your WIA-compliant scan-
ner to launch Elements, click the
Properties button in the Select Device
dialog box. (Refer to Figure 1-12.)
The properties for your selected
device are shown in a dialog box simi-
lar to the one shown in Figure 1-13.
Under the Actions item, choose
Photoshop Elements from the Start
This Program drop-down menu. Click
OK and you return to the Select Device

Phoning In Your Images
With newer cell phones, you have several ways you can get photos from
your phone to your computer. Elements doesn’t have a menu command to
import cell phone images directly. You first need to copy photos to your
computer and from there, you can import them into the Organizer or open
them in an editor.
Here’s what you find with cell phones and connection options:
 Cable connection: If your phone comes with a USB port on the phone,
you can connect your phone to your computer and copy images from
the phone’s memory card or hard drive to your computer. Your com-
puter should see the cell phone as an external device. In some cases,
you may need to load software that was provided by your cell phone
developer.
 Bluetooth: If your computer and your phone are equipped with
Bluetooth, you can use your computer’s Bluetooth interface to Browse
for a device to connect to your phone. On your phone, you accept the
connection invitation and after you are connected you can perform a
wireless transfer of your files.
 E-mail: Phones equipped with Internet connection options and e-mail
provide you with the ability to e-mail photos to your desktop e-mail
client. After these are e-mailed to your e-mail client, you can save the
files to a target folder.
Figure 1-15: Make adjustments in the
Advanced Properties dialog box.

Getting Files from Folders
95
After you copy photos to your hard drive, you can get the photos in the
Organizer, as we explain in Book II, Chapter 1, or open them directly in an
editor.
Getting Files from Folders
We’ve covered several different options you might use to copy files to your
hard drive. Whether you have opened a folder from a media device or
copied cell phone images to your computer, after they are on your com-
puter’s hard drive, you want to work with them in Elements.
To load files copied to your hard drive into the Organizer, do the following:
1. Copy files to a folder.
You can organize photos into separate folders on your hard drive, nest
folders, or copy a bunch of photos to a single folder. When you use mul-
tiple folders, you repeat the steps here to import each folder’s images
into the Organizer. If you nest folders, you can get files from a parent
folder and all subfolders.
2. Choose File➪Get Photos and Videos➪From Files and Folders.
You can import a single file or a
collection of images using this
command. When you choose the
menu command, the Get Photos
from Files and Folders dialog box
opens as shown in Figure 1-16.
3. Select images to import.
If you want to import all photos
within a given folder, click any file
in the list and then press Ctrl/Ô+A
to select all. Alternatively, you can
click and Ctrl/Ô-click to select files
individually in a noncontiguous
order or click and Shift-click to select photos in a contiguous order.
4. Specify your Fix Red Eyes and Photo Stacks options.
If you want to automatically correct red-eye problems or create photo
stacks, check the check boxes respectively for these options.
5. Get the photos.
Click Get Photos and wait for Elements to complete the import process.
Your photos appear in a new Organizer window and you’re ready to apply
edits in either the Organizer or an editor.

Opening an Image in Full Edit Mode
You might have a single photo you want to edit without adding it to the
Organizer. Perhaps you just want to apply some edits to an image you have
on a media source or on your hard drive and then send it off via e-mail or
share the photo on Photoshop.com.
If this is the case, you can bypass the Organizer and start in Full Edit mode.
To open an image in Full Edit mode, do the following:
1. Launch Photoshop Elements.
2. Click Edit.
The Full Edit mode workspace opens.
3. Choose File➪Open.
4. If you want to search for photos saved within a given format, open
the All Formats drop-down list and select the format for a file you
want to open.
Selecting a format narrows down a
collection of photos so that only
files saved within the selected
format are displayed. For example,
if you have Camera Raw, JPEG, and
TIFF images in a folder, and you
want to open only a JPEG file, you
can select JPEG (*.JPG, *.JPEG,
*.JPE) from the All Formats drop-
down list, as shown in Figure 1-17.
Doing so displays only files saved
in the format you choose from the
drop-down list.
If you’re not sure what format the
file you want to open is, then leave
the default choice from the menu
at All Formats.
5. From the list of photo files dis-
played, click the photo you want to open.
6. Click the Open button in the Open dialog box.
The file opens in Full Edit mode.
Figure 1-17: File formats supported for
opening images.

Using Open As
You may have a photo that was saved as a JPEG, TIFF, or some other format
without a file extension or an incorrect file extension for the file type. You
may not see the file listed in the Open dialog box, but you know it’s there,
and you know what format the file is. If this is the case, you can try to use
the Open As command.
Choose File➪Open As and the Open As dialog box opens providing you the
same options as the Open dialog box. Choose a format from the Open As
drop-down list and click the file you want to open. Click Open and see if it
works. In some cases, Elements may not recognize the file if it is damaged. In
other cases, you may be able to resurrect a damaged file.
Opening recently edited files
A quick way to open a recently edited file is to use the File➪Open Recently
Edited File command. The submenu lists these files. The number of files
appearing in the submenu is determined in the Preferences, as we explain in
Book I, Chapter 4.
If the file you want to open appears in the submenu, click the filename in the
list and the file opens in Full Edit mode.
The Recently Edited Files list also appears in the Organizer. If you want to
open a recently edited image while in the Organizer workspace, choose
File➪Open Recently Edited File and select the file you want to open. The file
opens in Full Edit mode.
Placing files
You may have a piece of artwork you want to add to a photo. The artwork
can be of any file type you find for the supported formats that you can open
in Elements. Quite often you may find a vector art drawing or a PDF file that
contains the artwork you want to import; however, any of the supported for-
mats can be used for placing content on a photo.
To place content in Elements you use the the Place command as follows:
1. Open a photo in Full Edit mode.
You must start with a file open in Full Edit mode in order to use the
Place command.
2. Choose File➪Place.
The Place dialog box opens. This dialog box has the same options you
find in the Open dialog box.

3. Select a file to place.
Your file can be an image format, EPS, or other type of vector format,
PDF or any other file type you see listed in the Files of type (Windows)
or Format (Macintosh) drop-down list. Click the file you want to place.
4. Click Place.
When you place an image, you see handles around the image that can
be used for sizing the image, as shown in Figure 1-18.
5. Size and position the image.
If you import a vector art image or PDF file containing vector art, you
can drag the corner handles out to size up the image without losing
image quality. Press the Shift key when sizing the image to constrain
proportions and press the Enter/Return key to accept your resizing
edits. After you press the Enter key, the image data are rasterized and
lose image quality if you decide to upsize the image. Click the image
and move it to the desired position. (For more information on vector
versus raster art and upsizing images, see Book III, Chapter 1.)

Converting Clipboard Data to Images
99
Creating a New Image
You may want to start with a fresh new canvas where you can copy and
paste content from other pictures, place objects, add shapes, and/or add
text to create your own scene. To begin the process, you create a new
image.
In either Full Edit mode or the Organizer, choose File➪New➪Blank File.
If you start in the Organizer, Elements switches workspaces from the
Organizer to Full Edit mode and the New dialog box opens, as shown
in Figure 1-19.
The options you have here are covered thoroughly in Book III, Chapter 2.
Look over that chapter for details on the options you have for creating new,
blank files.
Figure 1-19: Choose File➪New➪Blank File to open the 
New dialog box from either the Organizer or Full Edit mode.
Converting Clipboard Data to Images
Whatever you copy to the Clipboard in Elements can be converted to an
image. If you copy data from somewhere else, such as text in Office applica-
tions, objects in Office applications, illustration programs and other types of
applications, the data on the Clipboard can be converted to a new Elements
image.
Book II
Chapter 1
Acquiring, Saving,
and Exporting
Images

Saving Files
100
After copying data from another application, choose File➪New➪Image from
Clipboard. The data converted to a new document in Elements creates a
new file at 72 ppi.
If you want to convert something like a vector object to an Elements file
with a resolution higher than 72 ppi, create a new document in Elements at
the desired resolution. Then use the File➪Place command. When you
accept the edits by pressing the Enter/Return key, the data are rasterized at
the resolution of the open file.
Saving Files
Photoshop Elements files can be saved in a variety of different formats.
Some format types require you to convert a color mode before the format
can be used. Therefore, a relationship exists between file formats and
saving files. Additionally, bit depths in images also relate to the kinds of file
formats you can use in saving files.
Before you go too far in Elements, you should really familiarize yourself with
the file formats you use and the conversions you need to make in order to
save in one format or another (as we explain in Book III, Chapters 1 and 2).
If you do nothing to an image in terms of converting modes or changing bit
depth, you can save a file after editing in the same format in which the file
was opened. In many circumstances, you open an image and prepare it for
some form of output, which requires more thought about the kind of file
format you use in saving the file.
Using the Save/Save As dialog box
In most any program, the Save (or Save As) dialog box is a familiar place
where you make some choices about the file to be saved. With Save As, you
can save a duplicate copy of your image or a modified copy and retain the
original file.
To use the Save (or Save As) dialog box, choose File➪Save for files to be
saved the first time, or choose File➪Save As for any file. Either command
opens a dialog box for you.
The standard navigational tools you find in any Save dialog box appear in
the Elements Save/Save As dialog box. Here are some standard options you
find in the Elements Save/Save As dialog box:
 Filename: This item is common to all Save dialog boxes. Type a name
for your file in the text box.
 Format: From the drop-down menu, you select file formats. We explain
the formats supported by Elements later in this chapter.

Batch Processing Files
101
A few options make the Photoshop Elements Save/Save As dialog box differ-
ent from other Save dialog boxes you might be accustomed to using. The
Save Options area in the Save As dialog box provides these choices:
 Include in the Organizer: If you want the file added to the Organizer,
select this check box. 
 Save in Version Set with Original: You can edit images and save a ver-
sion of your image, but only in Quick Edit mode. When you save the file
from Quick Edit mode, this check box is active. Select the box and a ver-
sion of the original is saved and appears in the Organizer.
 Color: Check the box for the ICC (International Color Consortium)
Profile. Depending on which profile you’re using, the option appears for
sRGB or Adobe RGB (1998). When the check box is selected, the profile
is embedded in the image. See Book III, Chapter 4 for more information
on profiles.
 Thumbnail: If you save a file with a thumbnail, you can see a miniature
representation of your image when viewing it in folders or on the desk-
top. If you select Ask When Saving in the Saving Files preferences, the
check box can be enabled or disabled. If you’re choosing an option for
Never Save or Always Save in the Preferences dialog box, this box is
enabled or disabled for you and is grayed out. You need to return to the
Preferences dialog box if you want to change the option.
 Use Lower Case Extension: File extensions give you a clue to which file
format was used when a file was saved. Elements automatically adds the
extension to the filename for you. Your choices are to use uppercase or
lowercase letters for the extension name. Select the check box for Use
Lower Case Extension for lowercase or deselect the check box if you
want to use uppercase characters in the filename.
Saving files for the Web
You save files for Web hosting in a different dialog box than you do when
you’re saving files for other output. Choose File➪Save for Web; the Save for
Web dialog box opens. In Book III, Chapter 2, we explain all you need to
know about how to use the Save for Web dialog box.
Batch Processing Files
Elements provides you some automated features for processing batches of
photos. You can export multiple files from one format to another file format,
and you can export files changing file formats if you like. In addition, you
have a limited number of other editing tasks you can automate.
The method you use and the features you want depend on whether you
choose Export in the Organizer or Process Files in Full Edit mode.
Book II
Chapter 1
Acquiring, Saving,

102
Exporting files
When you open JPEG images and save back to a JPEG format, you’re adding
file compression to the saved images. JPEG is a lossy file format, which
means that you lose image data when you save in this format. If you edit a
JPEG image many times and save back to JPEG format each time, you con-
tinually lose more image data.
In some cases you may want to convert multiple JPEG files to a file format
that doesn’t toss away data. You can use formats such as Photoshop PSD or
TIFF, and no data are thrown away when you save the file.
For a single instance when you want to convert a JPEG image to a PSD or TIFF
image, you can open the file in Elements and choose File➪Save As. From the
Files of type (Windows) or Format (Macintosh), choose the desired format.
If you have multiple files and you want to convert the file type more effi-
ciently, you can process a folder of files using a single command. To use a
batch process type of action to convert multiple files from one format to
another, do the following:
1. Open the Organizer.
You should have a collection of photos in the Organizer saved as JPEG
or some other format that you want to convert to a newer format.
2. Select files in the Organizer you want to convert.
Click a file and press Shift and
click the last file in a group or click
and press Ctrl/Ô and click all the
photos you want to convert.
3. Choose File➪Export as New Files.
The Export New Files dialog box
opens as shown in Figure 1-20.
4. Choose an Export file format.
If converting JPEG files, you might
want to choose PSD for the file
format. This format does not com-
press files.
5. Choose a Size and Quality.
Choose Original if you want to
maintain the same file dimensions
and resolution. If you want a differ-
ent size for the saved files, make a
choice from the Photo Size drop-
down list.
Figure 1-20: The Export New Files
dialog box.

Batch Processing Files
103
6. Click Browse.
You can target a folder on your hard drive if you don’t want to use the
default folder shown in the Export New Files dialog box. 
7. Choose filenames.
You can save the files to a new folder with the same names without
overwriting the original files or save to the same folder adding a
common base name. If you click Common Base Name, you can type a
base name in the text box. Type something like Hawaii, for example, and
the files are saved as Hawaii001, Hawaii002, and so on.
8. Click Add/Remove to add additional files or remove some from the list.
If you want to add more files, click the Add plus (+) icon. You can scroll
the list of thumbnails, and if you find photos you want to remove, click
the respective photo and click the Remove minus (-) icon.
9. Click Export.
A progress bar is displayed in a
dialog box, as shown in Figure 1-21.
Wait for the progress to complete
before moving on.
10. Click OK.
After the export progress finishes,
the Exporting Files Complete
dialog box opens. Click OK, and
the file export task is completed.
Processing Multiple Files
The Export as New Files command in
the Organizer provides you a batch
process for converting file formats
with a rather limited set of options.
For much more power and the ability
to make several enhancements to
the new files saved, you can use the
Process Multiple Files command in
Full Edit mode.
You need to switch from the Organizer
to Full Edit mode to take advantage of
the additional features provided in the
Process Multiple Files dialog box. In
Full Edit mode, choose Edit➪Process
Multiple files to open the dialog box
shown in Figure 1-22.

Adding Pages
104
As you can see in Figure 1-22, you have far more options available to you in
the Process Multiple Files dialog box than you have in the Export New Files
dialog box shown earlier in Figure 1-20.
Among some of the additional choices are
 Image attributes: In the left pane of the dialog box, you have all the
attribute options you would have if you were exporting files. Make
choices for file-naming conventions, locations for saved files, image size
and resolution, and file formats.
 Quick Fix: From the options shown in the Quick Fix panel on the right,
you can check the boxes for the image enhancements you want to make.
For a complete description of these items, see Book VIII, Chapter 1.
 Labels: You can apply watermarks, custom labels, and choose a variety
of font attributes for text added to the new saved files.
Select a folder of files and make your choices in the Process Multiple Files
dialog box and click OK. Your files are converted and saved to the target
folder you identify in the dialog box.
Adding Pages
You can add pages to images for use
when creating projects such as slide
shows. Any pages you add to a docu-
ment can be blank new pages of the
exact same size and resolution as the
current image or a duplicate of the cur-
rent image added as an additional page.
To add new pages to a file, do the
following:
1. Open a photo in Full Edit mode.
2. Open a context menu on the
image thumbnail in the Photo
Bin or open the Edit menu and
choose Add Blank Page, as shown
in Figure 1-23. Alternatively, you
can choose Edit➪Add Blank Page.
The Add Blank Page menu 
command adds a blank page to 
the current open document. If 
Figure 1-23: Choose Add Blank Page
from a context menu opened on a photo in
the Photo Bin.

Closing and Quitting
105
you want to copy the content in the file and duplicate it on a new 
page, choose Add Page Using Current Layout from either menu 
command.
3. Click OK.
An application alert dialog box opens, informing you that the file must
be saved as a Photo Creation Project (PSE) file type. Click OK and your
new page is added.
4. Save the file.
Choose File➪Save As and the Save As dialog box defaults to a PSE file
format. Locate a target folder and click Save.
Obviously, when adding new pages to an image and saving as a Photo
Project, you want to add content to the new page and perhaps add addi-
tional pages. We show you more on creating projects in Book IX, Chapter 1.
For now, be aware that you can add additional pages to photos and that the
files must be saved as PSE files in order to preserve the additional pages.
Closing and Quitting
It’s important to understand a few things when closing files and quitting
Elements. When you are in Full Edit mode and have an image open in the
Image window, you can close the image without quitting the Full Edit mode
workspace. Click the X button in the top-right corner of the Image window or
the red button in the top-left corner (Macintosh) and the open file is closed.
If you click the X (red button) in the top-right corner of the Full Edit mode
workspace, you quit Full Edit mode. Alternatively, you can press Ctrl/Ô+K or
press Alt+F4 on Windows.
If you happen to have the Organizer and an editor open and you quit one
workspace, the other workspace remains open. For example, if the Organizer
and Full Edit mode are both open and you quit the Organizer, Full Edit mode
remains open, and vice versa.
If you make an edit on a photo in Full Edit mode and decide to quit Full Edit
mode, Elements prompts you to save the file before quitting.
If you also have the Welcome screen open as well as the Organizer and an
editor, quitting both the Organizer and the editor does not get you out of
Elements. The Welcome screen can remain open even though you’ve quit
the workspaces.

I
n Book II, Chapter 1, we talk about getting images from cameras, card
readers, scanners, and other media sources. For good measure, we also
talk about opening a file directly in an editor, copying files to your hard
drive, and loading up images in Elements.
To continue the story, be aware that any files loaded
in Elements end up in the Organizer. Furthermore, when
you add files to the Organizer, you have many options
for managing files, sorting them, searching for files,
tagging files with keywords, examining file proper-
ties, and using a host of different project-creation
opportunities.
This chapter covers many of the features you find
when working in the Organizer; gives some tips on
how to best manage collections of your photos in
an Organizer catalog; and takes a closer look at a
number of different tasks you can perform that are
unique to working in the Organizer. 

Cataloging Files

Cataloging Files
The default Organizer view — the view you’re most likely to use in all your
Elements work sessions — looks a lot like a slide sorter. The Organizer pro-
vides an efficient means to access the photos you wish to open in one of the
editors. Just double-click a photo in the Organizer, and you see the image
zoom in size to fill an Organizer window. You can carefully examine the
photo to be certain that it’s the one you want and then just select which
editor you want to use from the Editor drop-down list on the Menu bar, from
the context menu you open on the image in the Organizer window, or by
clicking the Fix button in the Panel Bin.
In addition to the default view in the Organizer, you have some other oppor-
tunities for examining your pictures. You can view pictures in a slideshow,
or you can view pictures side-by-side to compare them.
Adding files to the default Organizer view
The first step to working in the Organizer involves loading up images in a
new catalog. By default, when you launch Elements and open the Organizer
you arrive at an empty default catalog. Before you can do anything in the
Organizer, you need to import images into a catalog.
As we explain in Book II, Chapter 1, you can copy images to your computer
via a drag-and-drop method, using the AutoPlay wizard, or by using the
Photoshop Elements Downloader wizard. 
Presuming you copied photos to your hard drive, as we explain in Book II,
Chapter 1, here’s how you add them to the default empty catalog:
1. Open the Organizer.
Launch Elements and click Organize in the Welcome screen.
2. In the Organizer, choose File➪Get Photos and Videos➪From Files and
Folders.
The Get Photos from Files and Folders dialog box opens, as shown in
Figure 2-1.

Cataloging Files
109
Figure 2-1: The Get Photos from Files and Folders dialog box.
3. From the View menu (circled in Figure 2-1), choose Large icons (or
Medium icons).
In Large icon (or Medium icon) view, thumbnail images of most of your
files appear in a scrollable list large enough to see some detail. (Note: You
might not see Camera Raw files and some files saved in different formats.)
This view makes it easy to locate the files you want to add to the
Organizer. For example, if you want to load only Camera Raw images, you
can easily see them represented as icons, rather than as image previews.
4. Select files to add to the Organizer window.
Click a thumbnail and use either the Shift key or the Ctrl/Ô key to select
additional photos. When you hold down Shift and click, all photos between
the first thumbnail and the thumbnail you Shift-click are selected. When
you Ctrl/Ô-click you can select additional noncontiguous photos.
5. Click Get Photos to add the selected photos to the Organizer window.
Photos are imported into your default catalog.
6. View all photos.
After importing photos, a dialog box opens as shown in Figure 2-2. The
dialog box displays information related to viewing your photos in the
Organizer. Click OK and then click the Show All button in the Shortcuts
bar to view the photos in the catalog.

Figure 2-2: Click OK and then click Show All.
Adding additional photos to a catalog
To add additional photos to a catalog, you use the same File➪Get Photos 
and Videos➪From Files and Folders or you can choose to get photos from a
camera, a card reader, or a scanner as we explain in Book II, Chapter 1.
You follow the same steps to import photos as you did when you created
your new catalog. When you arrive at the same dialog box, shown in Figure
2-1, the new imported images are displayed in a new Organizer view. After
clicking OK, you click Show All to see the new imported images and the
original files you imported into your default catalog.
Importing images to a new catalog
If you have lots of pictures — perhaps numbering in the hundreds or even
thousands — you’re still to able to add each and every one of these photos
to a single catalog. However, doing so slows down the performance in the
Organizer and makes searching for photos a bit more difficult. A better option 
for you when dealing with large numbers of photos is to create separate 
catalogs.
You might have a number of photos that were taken at some event or spe-
cial occasion and want to create a separate new catalog to manage just
those files. Here’s how you go about creating a second catalog:

Cataloging Files
111
1. In the Organizer, choose File➪Catalog.
The Catalog Manager opens, as
shown in Figure 2-3.
2. In the Catalogs section of the
Catalog Manager, choose an
accessibility level.
By default, your catalog is accessi-
ble to all users. If you have several
logons for different users, all users
are able to access the 
catalog.
If you want to make the catalog
accessible only to you and not to
others logging on to your com-
puter, click the Catalogs Accessible
by the Current User radio button.
3. Choose a location.
By default, the catalog is saved to a default location. If you want to save
the catalog to a folder of choice, click the Custom Location radio button
and click the Browse button to select a folder on your hard drive where
you want to store the catalog.
4. Click New in the top-right corner of the Catalog Manager.
The Enter a Name for the New
Catalog dialog box opens, as
shown in Figure 2-4.
5. Type a name for your new catalog.
If you want to import free music
files for later use when creating
slideshows, check the check box
shown in Figure 2-4.
6. Click OK.
You return to the Catalog Manager and the new catalog is listed below
your default catalog.
7. Click OK in the Catalog Manager.
The new catalog opens in the Organizer with an empty screen. From
here, you can add photos using any one of the methods described in
Book II, Chapter 1 to import images.

Importing legacy catalogs
If you’re a Photoshop Elements user of a previous version of Elements,
you may want to convert an older catalog created in an earlier version of
Elements to one that can be recognized by Elements 7.
To convert a legacy catalog, open the
Catalog Manager by selecting File➪
Catalog. Click the catalog you want to
convert and then click the Convert
button in the Catalog Manager to open
the Convert Catalog dialog box. Click
the Show Previously Converted
Catalogs check box, and the list
expands to display older catalogs, as
shown in Figure 2-5. Additionally, you
can click the Find More Catalogs button and locate catalogs saved to your
hard drive. 
Click Done and the catalogs are converted and displayed in the Catalog
Manager.
Switching catalogs
As you create new catalogs, you’ll want to switch back and forth between
catalogs to view photos in the Organizer. If you make a catalog active, you,
of course, see only the photos you have previously added to that particular
catalog.
To switch catalogs, choose
File➪Catalog to open the Catalog
Manager. From the list of catalogs that
appears, click the catalog you want to
open, as shown in Figure 2-6.
When the catalog you want to open is
selected, click the Open button. The
photos added to the catalog appear in
the Organizer, and you’re ready to edit
the pictures.

Viewing Images in the Organizer
The Organizer window shows you all files that have been added to a particu-
lar catalog. You can change the types of views you see in the Organizer to
facilitate finding photos and managing them. 
Thumbnail view
When you open the Organizer, the default view is a Thumbnail display. Your
photos, videos, projects, audio files, and so on are shown as mini-images or
icons that can be adjusted to different sizes. In the Shortcuts bar, you can
move a slider left to create smaller thumbnail views or right to create larger
thumbnail views in the Organizer window.
The icon on the left side of the slider, shown in Figure 2-7, takes you to a
default view of small thumbnail images in the Organizer window. The icon
on the far right shows you a single image in the Organizer window. You can
move the slider left to see thumbnails at smaller sizes or right to view the
thumbnails at larger sizes.
Figure 2-7: Move the slider to change the size of the thumbnails.

If you double-click a photo, the image thumbnail zooms into view as a single
photo in the Organizer. To return to a view where you see smaller thumb-
nails, click the icon to the left of the slider.
The Thumbnail display is one of many
options for viewing photos and other
files in the Organizer. A quick glance at
the Display drop-down menu shows
some alternative views available to
you, as shown in Figure 2-8.
Import Batch view
Below the default option for Thumbnail
View, you find Import Batch. (To get
there, open the Display menu and then
select Import Batch, or press Ctrl+Alt+2 on your keyboard.) The display in the
Organizer keeps the view set to thumbnails, but the order of your files
changes to a date order (according to the date you imported the files with the
Get Photos and Videos command, as discussed in Book II, Chapter 1). This
view can be helpful if you want to organize images according to the batch you
imported on a given day.
Folder Location view
What’s nifty about the Folder Location display is that you can peruse your
hard drive for all files and folders while you remain in the Organizer
window. Just select Folder Location from the Display menu or press
Ctrl/Ô+Alt+3 to make an Explorer sidebar show you your hard drive(s), net-
work locations, and offline media.
Choosing Folder Location changes the view to something approaching what
you see in Figure 2-9. When you want to poke around in a folder, right-click
and select Reveal in Explorer from the context menu that appears. A
Windows Explorer window opens on top of the Organizer window and
shows you all the files contained in that folder.
When you find an image you want to edit, right-click and choose Open With➪
Adobe Photoshop Elements 7.0 (Editor). The image then opens in Full Edit
mode in Elements.
When you want more of the screen window dedicated to seeing the files in
the Organizer, hide the Panel Bin by clicking the Separator bar. One click on
the tiny right-pointing arrow on the Separator bar hides the panel. Click the
arrow on a collapsed panel to reopen that panel. In Figure 2-9, you see the
Organizer window with the Panel Bin hidden, so that more thumbnail
images display in the Organizer window.

Date View
Choose Date View (Ctrl+Alt+D) from
the Display menu to change your
Organizer window to a calendar show-
ing you the dates on which your
images were shot. The date information
is derived from metadata imported
with your images that are recorded by
your camera. (For more information on
metadata, see “Searching metadata”
later in this chapter.)
If you shoot many pictures on a given
date, the images are stacked on the
calendar for that date. In the Project
Bin in Full Edit mode, you find arrows
that are used to scroll the stacked
images left or right. Notice that a
number appears in the lower-left
corner of the image thumbnail in view.
In Figure 2-10, the numbers appear as 5
of 6. This means that on April 13, 2008
(the date at the top of the thumbnail), six photos were taken, and the cur-
rent view is the fifth photo in the stacked order.

Show Map
How would you like to see a visual display of where your photos were taken
geographically? Photoshop Elements 7 provides you the answer with Yahoo!
Maps and an option for placing your photos on a world map.
To open Yahoo! Maps in Elements, open the Display menu in the Shortcuts
bar and choose Show Map. The Map panel on the left side of the Organizer
window opens, as shown in Figure 2-11.
You must have an Internet connection active on your computer to work
with Yahoo! Maps.
To map the location of photos shown in the Organizer to Yahoo! Maps, you
can choose from a couple different options:
 Select photos in the Organizer and drag them to a map location on
the map in the Map panel.
 Select photos in the Organizer and right-click one of the selected
photos. From the menu options, choose Place on Map. In the dialog box
that opens, type a city name and click the Find button. If more than one
city is reported in the dialog box, click the city name you want to use
for the mapped photos.
Figure 2-11: Choose Show Map from the Display menu to open Yahoo! Maps.

To move around the map, place the cursor inside the Yahoo! Map panel and
drag the map with the Hand tool within the panel window. If you go too far
left, don’t worry; the Asian, Indian, and Eastern European countries are
found by dragging right across the Atlantic and eastward. Dragging left
stops somewhere around the International Date Line; so, if you live in
Singapore, you need to keep dragging right to find your country.
Zooming in the Map panel is handled by the tools you see at the bottom of
the map. Use the Zoom In tool to find cities and road maps in a detailed
view. Use the Zoom Out tool after you find the location you want to use.
After you add photos to the map, you
can view the images by clicking the red
pin placed on the map each time that
you add photos to a location. Click the
red pin to open a pop-up window that
shows a thumbnail view of the current
photo with smaller photos in a slide
organizer below the primary image
thumbnail, as shown in Figure 2-12.
Click the left and right arrows in the
pop-up window to scroll the slides.
Clicking the current image thumbnail
in the pop-up window opens the image
in a slideshow view. To find out more
about slideshow views, see the follow-
ing section.
In the Map panel, you can choose from
several display options in the drop-
down menu on the bottom-right side of
the panel. Choose from the default Map
(the standard cartographic type), a
Hybrid map (the topographic type), or
Satellite map. Choose Satellite to locate
Uncle Jeremy’s house, where the last family reunion took place at which you
shot all those wonderful pictures.
To close the Map panel, return to the Display menu and choose Show Map
again. The panel collapses, and you’re back to the standard Organizer view.
When you view panels in Elements, drag the vertical separator bar on a
panel to widen the panel or reduce the panel size. Look for the arrowhead
on the vertical bar separating the Organizer window from a panel, and click
and drag left or right to change panel sizes.

Viewing Images in a Slideshow
Are you ready for some exciting viewing in Photoshop Elements? Using an
alternative view of your Organizer files, you can see your pictures in a self-
running slideshow (in Full Screen view), complete with transition effects
and background music. Full Screen view takes you to a slideshow view. For
the purposes of clarity, think of Full Screen view and viewing a slideshow as
the same thing. Full-screen viewing temporarily hides the Elements tools
and menus, and gives you the most viewing area on your monitor to see
your pictures.
Viewing files in slideshow mode can be helpful for quickly previewing the
files you want to edit for all kinds of output, as well as for previewing
photos that you might use for an exported slideshow, which we explain
in Book IX, Chapter 1.
Setting up your images for viewing
To set up your slideshow and/or enter Full Screen view, follow these steps:
1. Open the Organizer.
2. Select images that you want to see in a slideshow or use all the
images in the Organizer for your slideshow.
If no images are selected when you enter Full Screen view, all photos in
the Organizer window are shown in Full Screen view.
3. Choose Display➪View Photos in Full Screen (or press F11 on your
keyboard).
The Full Screen View Options
dialog box, shown in Figure 2-13,
opens.
4. Choose the options for your
slideshow in the dialog box.
The Full Screen View Options
dialog box offers a number of
choices for viewing a slideshow in
Full Screen view. Table 2-1 explains
each option.
5. After you determine the attributes
for full-screen viewing, click OK.
You enter full-screen mode. For a
moment, the Full Screen View toolbar appears at the top of the window.
This toolbar hides automatically after a few seconds. We explain in 
Table 2-1 — and show you in Figure 2-14 — how Full Screen view appears
if you select the Show Filmstrip check box.

Sorting Images
With all the Photoshop Elements modes and workspaces you have become
familiar with, you need a consistent starting place to handle all your editing
tasks. Think of the Organizer as Grand Central Station. From this central
location, you can take the Long Island Railroad to any destination you
desire. In Elements terms, rather than head out to Port Washington, you
travel to an editing mode. Rather than go to the Hamptons, you journey
through all the creation areas. In short, the Organizer is the central depot
on the Photoshop Elements map.
In addition to being a tool to navigate to other workspaces, the Organizer
is a management tool you can use to organize, sort, search, and describe
photos with identity information. In terms of sorting and organizing files,
Elements provides many different options, and we cover them all in the
following sections.

Using Search Options
123
Using sort commands
One quick way to sort images in the
Organizer is to use the menu in the
Shortcuts bar in the Organizer window
for date sorting. Two options are avail-
able to you, as shown in Figure 2-17.
The sorting options available to you
from the menu are
 Date (Newest First): Select this
option to view images according to
the date you took the photos, beginning with the most recent date.
 Date (Oldest First): This option displays photos in chronological order,
starting with the oldest file.
You can also view files according to the Import Batch date and Folder
Locations, as we mention in the section “Viewing Images in the Organizer,”
earlier in this chapter. 
Sorting media types
Photos can also be sorted according to
media type. Elements supports view-
ing photos, video files, audio files, 
projects you create in Elements, and
Adobe PDF files. To select different
media types, choose View➪Media
Types, and a submenu offers options
for viewing the different media types
as shown in Figure 2-18. Select a menu
item from the submenu to make all
media types matching the menu com-
mand appear in the Organizer window.
Using Search Options
The Organizer’s Find menu is devoted entirely to searching photos. From
the Find menu, you can locate photos in albums, catalogs, and the Organizer
window according to a variety of different search criteria.
Book II
Chapter 2
Working in the
Organizer
Figure 2-17: You can quickly sort files in
Date Ascending or Date Descending order.
Figure 2-18: You can quickly sort files
according to media types.

Using Search Options
124
To use the commands on the Find menu, you need to have photos loaded in
the Organizer window or create albums or catalogs, which we explain in this
chapter. The categories in the following sections can be searched in the
Organizer.
Searching by date
When you have a number of different files in an Organizer window including
photos shot on different dates, you can narrow your search to find photos —
and all other types of files supported by Elements — through a date search.
Be careful, though. The date is taken from the camera metadata, but if a
date isn’t available from the camera data, the date is taken from the file-cre-
ation date. The creation date is not likely to be the date you shot the photo.
To search files by date, follow these steps:
1. If you haven’t yet added photos to your default catalog, open files in
the Organizer by first choosing File➪Get Photos and then choosing a
submenu command for acquiring files.
To open files stored on your hard drive, choose the From Files and
Folders submenu command.
2. To select a date range, choose Find➪Set Date Range.
The Set Date Range dialog box,
shown in Figure 2-19, opens.
3. Specify the dates.
Type a year in the Start Date Year
text box. Select the month and day
from the Month and Day drop-
down lists. Repeat the same selec-
tions for the End Date.
4. Click OK.
The thumbnails shown in the Organizer window include only files cre-
ated within the specified date range.
Searching for untagged items
You can tag files with a number of different criteria, as we explain later in
this chapter in the section “Organizing and Managing in the Organizer.”
When tags are added to images, you can sort files according to tag labels.
Figure 2-19: Open the Set Date Range
dialog box and specify the start and end
dates.

Using Search Options
125
We cover sorting by tag labels later in this chapter, too. For now, take a look
at the Find menu and notice the Untagged Items command. If you want to
add tags to certain items, and so want to show only the untagged files,
choose Find➪Untagged Items or press Ctrl/Ô+Shift+Q. Elements displays all
files without tags in the Organizer window.
Searching albums
You can create albums (as we describe
later in this chapter in the section
“Creating Albums”) and then select an
album in the Albums panel (contained
in the Organize panel), as shown in
Figure 2-20. Selecting an album is like
having a first level of sorting. You can
then search by date or other sort
options discussed in the preceding
and following sections to narrow your
choices.
Searching captions 
and notes
When captions or notes are added to
files, you can search for the caption
name, contents of a note, or both. In
order to search captions and notes,
though, you first need to add them to
your images.
Adding captions and notes
A way to identify your files beyond the tagging capabilities, which we dis-
cuss in the section “Organizing and Managing in the Organizer,” later in this
chapter, is to add captions and notes. When you add a caption or note, you
can search captions or notes by choosing the Find➪By Caption or Note
menu command. Captions and notes are also helpful when you create differ-
ent keyword tags — such as slide presentations and photo albums — by
using the Create panel, as we explain in Book IX, Chapter 1.
Text captions are easy to create. Although you can select a thumbnail image
in the Organizer window and choose Edit➪Add Caption, a better way is to
use the Properties panel. Just follow these steps:
Book II
Chapter 2
Working in the
Organizer
Figure 2-20: Select an album and then
use other search options to narrow your
search.

Using Search Options
126
1. To open the Properties panel, select a thumbnail image in the
Organizer, right-click it, and choose Show Properties from the context
menu that appears.
Alternatively, you can choose
Window➪Properties or press
Alt+Enter. In either case, the
Properties panel opens, as shown
in Figure 2-21.
2. Type a caption by adding text to
the Caption text box.
3. Type text in the Notes area on the
panel to add a note.
That’s all there is to it. You can
also record audio notes about an
image.
Searching the captions and 
notes content
After you create captions and notes, you can search for the words con-
tained in the descriptions.
To search caption names and notes in your open catalog, follow these steps:
1. Open the Organizer.
You should have images in a catalog and have files identified with cap-
tions and notes.
2. Choose Find➪By Caption or Note.
The Find by Caption or Note dialog
box opens, as shown in Figure 2-22.
Options in the dialog box are as
follows:
• Find Items with Caption or Note:
In the text box, type the words
you want to locate.
• Match Only the Beginning of
Words in Captions and Notes:
Click this radio button when
you know that your caption or
note begins with words that
you type in the text box.
Figure 2-21: The Properties panel.
Figure 2-22: Choose Find➪By Caption or
Note to open the dialog box in which
search criteria for captions and notes are
specified.

Using Search Options
127
• Match Any Part of Any Word in Captions or Notes: Click this radio
button if you’re not sure whether the text typed in the box is used at
the beginning of a caption or note, or whether it’s contained within
the caption name or note text.
3. Click OK.
Your results appear in the Organizer window.
Searching by history
Elements keeps track of what you do
with your photos, such as printing,
e-mailing, sharing, and performing a
number of other tasks. You can search
for files based on the file history by
choosing Find➪By History, as shown in
Figure 2-23. If you select options on the
By History submenu, you see files that
meet your criteria by date. 
Your options in the By History sub-
menu include
 Imported on: Choose this option
and you can select a date when
files were imported into the cur-
rent catalog. When you make this
choice in the submenu, a dialog box
opens where you can select the
import date and click OK. (All
options in the submenu display a
dialog box similar to Figure 2-24
when the respective menu com-
mand is selected.)
 E-mailed to: Click this menu item
and the list in Figure 2-24 changes
to reflect all the photos you
e-mailed from within Elements.
 Printed on: This option displays
all files printed in a date order for
the print date and time.
 Exported on: This choice displays files that were exported from the cur-
rent catalog.
 Ordered online: This item displays files that were submitted for an
online service.

128
 Shared online: This choice displays files that were shared online.
 Used in Projects: This option displays files that were used in projects.
See Book IX, Chapter 1 for all the different types of projects you can
create in Elements.
Searching metadata
Metadata includes both information about your images that’s supplied by
digital cameras and custom data you can add to a file. Metadata contains
descriptions of the image, such as your camera name, the camera settings
you used to take a picture, copyright information, and much more.
Searching metadata is easy. Just
choose Find➪By Details (Metadata) in
the Organizer. The Find by Details
(Metadata) dialog box opens. The first
two columns in the dialog box offer a
number of different choices for search
criteria and options based on the crite-
ria. In the third column, you specify
exactly what you want to search by
typing search criteria in the text box.
You can click the plus button to add
new lines to your search criteria, as
shown in Figure 2-25. Clicking the
minus button deletes a line.
Searching faces
If a magical method is available to you for searching files in Elements, it has
to be searching for faces. When you choose Find➪Find Faces for Tagging,
Elements searches through files you select in the Organizer window and
examines each image for a face — Homo sapiens faces, to be exact.
Note that you should first select a range of image thumbnails in the
Organizer window and then choose Find➪Find Faces for Tagging. If you don’t
select files, Elements searches the entire catalog. Be aware that if you search
through a large catalog, Elements takes some time to complete the search.
The result of the search magically includes all photos containing faces in
a Face Tagging window as shown in Figure 2-26. Although the command
is intended to identify images you can tag, you can use the command for
invoking a search and choosing to view all files containing faces.
Figure 2-25: Choose Find➪By Details
(Metadata) in the Organizer to open the
dialog box in which metadata are specified.

Organizing and Managing in the Organizer
129
Figure 2-26: The search result for finding faces appears in a window.
Organizing and Managing in the Organizer
Elements provides you with a great opportunity for organizing files, in the
form of keyword tags. After you acquire your images in the Organizer and sort
them, you can add some permanent keyword tags according to the dates you
took the pictures, the subject matter, or some other categorical arrangement.
Keyword tags were referred to as collections in Elements 5 and earlier.
In the Organizer window, two panels help you sort your pictures and keep
them well organized. You use the Keyword Tags panel (which we talk about
in the section “Working with keyword tags,” later in this chapter) to identify
individual images by using a limitless number of options for categorizing
your pictures. On the Keyword Tags panel, you can create keyword tags and
collection groups to neatly organize files.
Keyword tags are handy when you want to use the many different project
options, which we explain in Book IX, Chapter 1. You create a keyword tag
from files stored in various folders on your hard drive and preview the
images to be used in a creation. Select the images you want to use when
creating slideshows and photo albums, for example. When you finish
with the creations, go back and delete the keyword tag.

In the following sections, you can find out how to create and manage key-
word tags.
Creating a new keyword tag
To create a new keyword tag and add photos to the tag, follow these steps:
1. Open photos in the Organizer.
Open the Organizer window by clicking the Organizer button in an edit-
ing mode or by selecting Organize on the Welcome screen. Choose
File➪Get Photos and Videos➪From Files and Folders. Note that you
should’ve already copied some photos to your hard drive, as we explain
in Book II, Chapter 1.
2. To create a new keyword tag, click the plus sign (+) icon in the
Keyword Tags panel to open a drop-down menu and then choose
New Keyword Tag.
The Create Keyword Tag dialog
box opens, as shown in Figure 2-27.
3. Type a name for the tag in the
Name text box and add a note to
describe the keyword tag.
You might use the location where
you took the photos, the subject
matter, or other descriptive infor-
mation for the note.
4. If you want to assign the keyword
tag to a map location on Yahoo!
Maps, click the Place on Map
button.
When you click Place on Map, a
dialog box opens in which you
type a city name for placing the
image on Yahoo! Maps. Type a city
name and select the correct city
from options provided in a second
dialog box.
5. Click OK in the Create Keyword Tag dialog box.
You return to the Organizer window.

6. In the Organizer window, select the photos you want to keyword tag.
Click a photo and Shift-click another photo to select photos in a group.
Click a photo and Ctrl-click different photos scattered around the
Organizer window to select photos in a nonconsecutive order.
7. To add a new keyword tag to a photo (or selection of photos), click
one of the selected photos in the Organizer window and drag the
photo thumbnail to the New Tag icon in the Keyword Tags panel.
Alternatively, you can drag a tag from the Keyword Tags panel to the
selected photos.
When you release the mouse button, the new keyword tags are added to
the selected photos.
8. Repeat Steps 3 through 7 to create keyword tags for all the images
you want to organize.
9. To view one or more keyword tags, click the empty square adjacent to
a keyword tag icon to show the photos marked with that particular
keyword tag icon.
When you click the empty square,
an icon in the shape of a pair of
binoculars appears inside the
square, as shown in Figure 2-28. All
photos matching the keyword tags
are shown in the Organizer
window.
To return to viewing all photos in the
Organizer, click the binoculars in the
Keyword Tags panel. The square
returns to empty and turns off viewing
the tagged files.
Working with keyword
tags
You can manage keyword tags pretty
easily by using the Keyword Tags
panel. To access the major menu commands, either click the plus sign (+)
icon in the Keyword Tags panel to call up the New drop-down menu or right-
click a keyword tag on the Keyword Tags panel and make your choice from
the context menu that appears.

The New drop-down menu lets you access the following commands:
 New Keyword Tag: Create a new keyword tag, as we describe in the
steps in the preceding section.
 New Sub-Category: A subcategory is like a nested bookmark. Create
a subcategory by selecting New Sub-Category from the New menu; a
dialog box opens, prompting you to type a name for the new sub-
category. As an example for how you might use keyword tags and 
subcategories, you might have a keyword tag named Uncle Joe’s
Wedding. Then, you might create subcategories for Bride’s Dressing
Room, Ceremony, Family Photos, Reception, and so on.
 New Category: Choose New Category from the New menu in the
Keyword Tags panel to open a dialog box that prompts you to type a
name for the new category. By default, you find predefined category
names for People, Places, Events, and Other. If you want to add your
own custom category, use this menu command.
 From File: If you export a keyword tag, the file is written as XML
(eXtensible Markup Language). When you choose From File, you can
import an XML file of a keyword tags file.
 Save Keyword Tags to a File: You can save keyword tags to a file that
can be retrieved with the From File command. This option is handy
when you open a different catalog file and want to import the same col-
lection names created in one catalog file to another catalog file. (See the
section “Cataloging Files” earlier in this chapter.)
 Collapse All Keyword Tags: Keyword tags appear like bookmark lists
that can be collapsed and expanded. An expanded list shows you all the
subcategory keyword tags. Choose Collapse All Keyword Tags to col-
lapse the list.
 Expand All Keyword Tags: This command expands a collapsed list.
When you create a new keyword tag, you see a large icon in the Keyword
Tags panel. The default tags appear with small icons. You can access the
items that appear below default tags by clicking the right-pointing arrow
to expand the list.
Right-click a Keyword Tag name to make the following menu commands
appear:
 Change <keyword tag name> Keyword Tag to a Sub-Category:

you can click the Pencil tool on the Keyword Tags panel to open the
same dialog box.
 Delete <keyword tag name> Keyword Tag: Select a keyword tag and
then select this menu option to delete it. Alternatively, select the tag
and then click the Trash icon in the panel to delete a keyword tag. Note
that deleting a keyword tag doesn’t delete files.

 New Search Using <keyword tag name> Keyword Tag: This command
searches through a catalog and displays all the photos assigned the key-
word tag in the Organizer window.
 Add Photos with <keyword tag name> Keyword Tag to Search
Results: If you select one photo in the Organizer, the number is one.
Selecting more than one photo changes the number to the total number
of selected images. When you open a context menu, the selected images
are added to the keyword tag where the context menu is opened.
 Exclude Photos with <keyword tag name> Keyword Tag from Search
Results: Select photos in the Organizer window and choose this com-
mand to exclude the selected photos from the search.
 Attach <keyword tag name> Keyword Tag to <n> Selected Items:
Select a file in the Organizer window and choose this command to
attach the keyword tag to the file.
Keyword tags are saved automatically with the catalog you work with. By
default, Elements creates a catalog and auto-saves your work to it. If you
happen to create another catalog, as we explain earlier in the chapter,
your keyword tags disappear. Be aware of which catalog is open when you
create keyword tags so you can later return to them.
Using the Timeline
Looking at the Organizer window, you see Timeline located just above the
thumbnail images and below the Options bar. The Timeline begins with
those images you added to a catalog at the earliest date and stretches
across the Organizer window to the photos taken most recently.

You can narrow a search to examine photos within a given time frame by
dragging the Timeframe slider left or right. You also have two other sliders
that can be moved on the Timeline. By dragging the left-facing arrowheads
to the right and the right-facing arrowheads to the left, you can narrow the
number of thumbnail images that actually appear in the Organizer window.
In Figure 2-29, we dragged the outside sliders to narrow the number of photos
that appear in the Organizer and the center slider to target a specific date.
When you move the two outside sliders toward each other you hide image
thumbnails appearing in the Organizer that are outside the dates on the
Timeline relative to the slider positions. When you move the center slider,
Elements displays the first photo on a given date with the date flashing
below the respective image thumbnail.
Figure 2-29: We moved the sliders to narrow the view of images displayed in a catalog.
Using the Properties panel
We introduced the Properties panel earlier in Figure 2-21 when we talked
about adding captions and notes. In addition to adding this information to

Creating Albums

images, the Properties panel offers you some information about your files.
The information includes
 Rating files. You can assign ratings to files, as we describe later in this
chapter in the section “Rating images.”
 Date. The panel reports the date the picture was shot (or scanned).
 Directory path. The panel displays the directory path for the file loca-
tion on your hard drive.
 Sound. If the file contains a sound, the sound information is displayed.
Creating Albums
With keyword tags, you can organize files into categories and subcategories.
Doing so keeps your files neatly organized within a catalog. Elements offers
additional organizing control in the Albums panel. You might want to organ-
ize an album for sharing photos with others on Photoshop.com, assemble
an album with each photo rated within a range from one to five stars, create
a slideshow, or just use the Albums panel to further segregate images within
different categories.
Be aware that you have an Album panel in the Panel Bin, and you have some
options in the Create panel for designing projects similar to photo albums.
To avoid confusion, Elements refers to the projects not as photo albums but
as Photo Books and Photo Collages. The term Album in Photoshop Elements
nomenclature refers to a collection of images that are not yet integrated
into projects. The Album panel is used to organize files and help you
manage them.
Think of a catalog as a parent item and keyword tags as its children. Within
keyword tags, you can use the sort options we’ve talked about in this chap-
ter to sort files according to date. If you still have a number of files in an
Organizer window that are hard to manage, you can create tags that form
subcategories within the keyword tags. Additionally, you can create an
album out of a number of photos within a given keyword tag. For example,
you might have a huge number of photos taken on a European vacation.
Your catalog contains all the images taken on that trip. You can then create
keyword tags for files according to the country visited. You then might rate
the photos according to the best pictures you took on your trip. The highest-
rated images could then be assembled in an album and then later viewed as
a slideshow or integrated as part of a project such as a Photo Book.

Rating images
You can rate photos in the Organizer by tagging images with one to five
stars. You might have some photos that are exceptional, which you want to
give a five-star rating. Poor photos
with lighting and focus problems might
be rated with one star.
In versions earlier than Photoshop
Elements 6, you rated photos directly
in the Organizer window below each
photo thumbnail. In Elements 6 and
Elements 7, you rate photos in the
Properties panel or use the Edit➪
Ratings submenu.
To rate a file with a star rating, open a
context menu by right-clicking a photo
and select Properties from that menu.
The Properties — General panel,
shown in Figure 2-30, opens. Click a
star to rate the photo. Alternatively,
you can click a photo, choose
Edit➪Ratings, and choose a star rating from the submenu that appears.
Photoshop Elements 7 has changed how you view different ratings. Rated
views are no longer available in the Organizer window, as they were in ear-
lier versions of Elements. Now, you have a menu in the Shortcuts bar, which
appears in the top-right corner of the Organizer window. Notice the five
stars and the drop-down menu. The menu choices include
 And Higher: Click a star adjacent to the menu and choose And Higher
to make the photos with that rating and all ratings above the selected
star appear in the Organizer window.
 And Lower: Click a star adjacent to the menu and choose And Lower to
view all photos rated with the selected star and lower. For example, if
you click the third star, when you choose the menu command, all
photos rated with three stars or fewer appear in the Organizer window.
 Only: If you click five stars (or any other rating) and select Only, only
the images rated with the selected star are shown in the Organizer
window.
To return to a view in which all your photos are shown in the Organizer,
including all photos you haven’t rated, click Show All in the Shortcuts bar.

Adding rated files to an album
You might want to rate images with star ratings and then add all your
images to an album. Within the album, you can still choose to view your 
pictures according to star ratings.
Creating an album
In the section “Working with keyword
tags,” earlier in this chapter, we dis-
cuss how creating keyword tags and
assigning tags to photos help you
organize a collection of photos and
how subcategories help you break
down a collection into additional cate-
gories. With albums and star ratings,
you can further break down a collec-
tion into groups that you might want
to mark for printing, sharing, or
onscreen slideshows.
To create an album, follow these steps:
1. Click the Organize panel and
click the plus sign (+) icon in the
Albums panel and choose New
Album from the drop-down menu
shown in Figure 2-31.
The Album panel expands to show
the Album Details.
2. Name the new album.
Type a name for the album in the
Album Name text box.
3. View the
Backup/Synchronization Help.
Click the light bulb to display the
help information related to check-
ing the Backup/Synchronize check
box. Checking this check box 
protects your files by using
backup services provided by
Photoshop.com.
4. Click the help note to dismiss it from view.
A help note is shown in Figure 2-32.

5. Drag photos from the Organizer
to the Items window in the
Album Details panel, shown in
Figure 2-33.
Alternatively, you can select photos
in the Organizer and click the plus
sign (+) icon in the Album Details
panel to add them to the album.
6. Click Done at the bottom of the
panel — unfortunately not visible
in Figure 2-33.
Your new album now appears
listed in the Albums panel.
That’s it! Your new album is created,
and any photos you drag to the album
in the future are added to it. You can
isolate all the photos within a given
album by clicking the album name in
the Albums panel.
Creating multiple albums uses only a
fraction of the memory required to
duplicate photos for multiple pur-
poses, such as printing, Web hosting,
sharing, and so on.
Creating a Smart Album
You can perform a search based on a number of different criteria. You can,
for example, rate images with stars and choose to view all files with three or
more stars, or maybe you changed camera models and want to show only
the photos taken with your newest camera. You can search a catalog for
metadata, location, or some other criterion. Furthermore, you can combine
searches, for example, first searching for a location and then searching the
files within a given date range.
Another option for searching files is performing a search and saving the
search results and a complex set of search criteria in the form of a Smart
Album. You create a Smart Album by opening the New menu in the Albums
panel and choosing New Smart Album.
Figure 2-33: Drag photos to the Items
area in the Album Details panel.

139
The New Smart Album dialog box
opens, as shown in Figure 2-34. Type a
name for your new Smart Album and
make selections for the search criteria
below the Name text box. Click OK,
and the Smart Album is listed above
the albums in the Albums panel.
Creating an Album Group
The Album panel contains all the
albums and Smart Albums you create
in an organized list. By default, the
albums are listed in alphabetical order.
If you add many albums to the panel,
the list can be long, making it difficult to find the album you want to use for
a given editing session.
An Album Group is no more than a divider shown in the Albums panel. You
don’t add photos to the group. You nest albums within a group in a hierar-
chical order. To see how to create an Album Group, follow these steps:
1. Create several albums.
To begin, you should have two or more albums added to the Albums
panel. For example, suppose that you have many photos of a vacation
trip to Hawaii. You want to divide the photos by images taken at a luau,
a diving trip, a day on Waikiki Beach, or photos of other similar events
that you want to group together. For each category, such as Luau,
Diving, or Waikiki, you create a separate album.
2. Create an Album Group by clicking the New menu (the + sign) in the
Albums panel and choosing New Album Group.
The Create Album Group dialog
box, as shown in Figure 2-35,
opens.
3. Type a name for the group in the
Album Group Name text box.
You also have an option to choose
a parent group from a drop-down
list so you can nest albums in a
hierarchical order.

4. Click OK.
Your new Album Group is added to the Albums panel.
5. Click and drag an album onto the Album Group name in the Albums
panel.
The albums you drag to the Album
Group are nested within the group,
as shown in Figure 2-36.
Figure 2-36 shows an expanded Album
Group, as denoted by the list (below
Hawaii Photos) and the disclosure tri-
angle. To collapse a group, click the
down-pointing arrow. The group
names remain visible and provide you
with more viewing space in the Albums
panel, making it easier to scroll long
lists.
Like keyword tags, albums can be
saved to an XML (eXtensible Markup
Language) file, and the files can be
loaded in the Albums panel. Open the
New menu, where you find commands
for Save Albums to File and From File. You can export an album to a file and
then copy the file to another computer, making it easy to organize photos on
several computers.
Hiding Files That Get in the Way
Elements offers a few ways to hide files so that you can keep your images
organized and easy to find.
With a simple menu command, you can mark selected files in the Organizer
as hidden. You might have several files of the same subject and want to keep
only one file visible in the Organizer window. However, you may not want to
delete the other photos. You can hide files in the Organizer window and
later show the hidden files by using menu commands.
Select files you want to hide, and from either the Edit menu or a context
menu, choose Visibility➪Mark as Hidden. To see the files you mark for
hiding, return to the same Visibility menu and choose Show Hidden.
Essentially, you remove the check mark for Show Hidden, resulting in hiding
the files. To easily toggle between showing and hiding files marked for
hiding, choose View➪Hidden Files. Selecting this menu command toggles
between showing and hiding the files you marked for hiding.
Figure 2-36: Albums are nested below an
Album Group.

Hiding Files That Get in the Way

Stacking ’em up
Think of stacks like a stack of cards that are face-up. You see only the front
card, and all the other cards are hidden behind that card. Stacks work the
same way. You hide different images behind a foreground image. At any time,
you can sort the images or display all images in the stack in the Organizer
window.
To create a stack, follow these steps:
1. In the Organizer, select several photos.
You can select any number of photos. However, you can’t stack audio or
movie files.
2. Choose Edit➪Stack➪Stack Selected Photos.
Elements stacks your photos. The first image you select remains in view
in the Organizer window. In the upper-right area, an icon that looks like
a stack of cards appears on the image thumbnail when you’ve stacked
some images, as shown in Figure 2-37. The thumbnail itself appears as
though it sits atop a stack of other thumbnails.

After you stack a group of images, you can use the Stack submenu com-
mands to manage the photos. Click a stack to select it and then choose
Edit➪Stack. The submenu commands that are available include
 Automatically Suggest Photo Stacks: Select this command to make
Elements search the photos in the Organizer window for visually similar
appearances. Photos that have visually similar appearances are opened
in a separate window, where you can select photos you want to stack.
Make a selection of two or more photos, and select Stack Selected
Photos.
 Stack Selected Photos: This command remains grayed out unless you
have several photos selected to create a stack.
 Unstack Photos: Click a stack in the Organizer and choose this command
to return all images to the Organizer window and eliminate the stack.
 Expand Photos in Stack: This command expands the stack to show all
thumbnail images in the Organizer window.
 Collapse Photos in Stack: This command collapses a stack to show
only the top photo in the Organizer window.
 Flatten Stack: After you stack some photos, this command becomes
available. When you flatten a stack, the top-level photo is retained and
all other photos in the stack are deleted.
Be careful with this command. All photos except for the top photo
really are deleted from the catalog — although not from your hard disk.
 Remove Photo from Stack: Choosing this command removes the
selected photo from the stack. 
 Set as Top Photo: Before accessing this command, you first choose
Expand Photos in Stack. If you don’t like the topmost photo, select
another and choose this menu command to move the selected photo to
the top of the stack.
If you want to view all stacks in an Organizer window in expanded form,
choose View➪Expand All Stacks. Using this command doesn’t require you
to individually select stacks in the Organizer before expanding them.
Creating versions
Versions are similar to stacks, but you create versions from only one file.
You can edit an image and save both the edited version and the original as a
version set. Additional edits can be made in either editing mode and saved
to a version set. To create a version set, follow these steps:
1. Select an image by clicking it in the Organizer window.
2. Apply an edit.

Hiding Files That Get in the Way
143
For example, right in the Organizer, you can correct some brightness
problems in your image. Choose Edit➪Auto Smart Fix to adjust contrast
and brightness. See Book VIII, Chapter 2 for more details on adjusting
contrast and brightness.
3. View the items in the version set by clicking the image in the Organizer
and choosing Edit➪Version Set➪Expand Items in Version Set.
Elements automatically creates a version set for you when you apply
the Auto Smart Fix to the file. A new Organizer window opens and
shows two thumbnail images — one representing the original image
and the other representing the edited version.
4. To open the original in Full Edit mode, select the original image
and then select Full Edit from the Display drop-down menu on the
Organizer Menu bar.
5. Edit the image in Full Edit mode.
You can choose from many different menu commands to edit the image.
For example, change the color mode to Indexed Color by choosing
Image➪Mode➪Indexed Color, as we explain in Book III Chapter 2.
6. Save a version by choosing File➪Save As.
7. In the Save Options area of the Save As dialog box, select the Include
in the Organizer and Save in Version Set with Original check boxes.
8. Click Save.
The edit made in Full Edit mode is saved as another version in your 
version set.
When you have a version set, you can open the Edit➪Version Set submenu
and choose menu commands that are similar to commands available with
stacks. (See the preceding section for details.)
After you create a version set, you find additional submenu commands you
can use to manage the version set. Choose Edit➪Version Set, or open a con-
text menu on a version set and then choose Version Set. The submenu, as
shown in Figure 2-38, opens.
Figure 2-38: Use the Edit menu or a context menu opened on a version set,

Items listed in the Version Set submenu include
 Expand Items in Version Set: Click a version set and choose this menu
command to expand the items in the version set.
 Collapse Items in Version Set: When items are expanded, you can
return them to a collapsed view by selecting this command.
 Flatten Version Set: Be careful here. If you choose this command, you
lose all items in the version set except the top image.
 Convert Version Set to Individual Items: This command removes items
from the version set and adds each version as a separate image to the
Organizer window.
 Revert to Original: This command deletes the version set and returns
you to the original, unedited version of the file.
 Remove Item(s) from Version Set: This option removes any selected
item (or items) from a version set.
 Set as Top Item: When viewing an expanded version set, click one of the
images and choose this item to move it to the top.
Protecting Your Assets
Computer users often learn the hard way about the importance of backing
up a hard drive and the precious data you spent time creating and editing.
We can save you some aggravation right now before you spend any more
time editing your photos in Elements.
We authors are so paranoid when we’re writing a book that we back up our
chapters on multiple drives, CDs, and DVDs when we finish them. The stan-
dard rule is that if you spend sufficient time working on a project and it gets
to the point at which redoing your work would be a major aggravation, it’s
time to back up files.
Backing up your catalog
When organizing your files, adding keyword tags and albums, and creating
stacks and version sets, you want to back up the catalog file in case your
catalog becomes corrupted.
Here’s how you can use Elements to create a backup of your data:
1. Choose File➪Backup Catalog to CD/DVD or Hard Drive to open the
Backup Catalog to CD/DVD or Hard Drive wizard.
This wizard has three panes that Elements walks you through to pain-
lessly create a backup of your files.

Protecting Your Assets
145
2. Select the source to back up.
The first pane in the Burn/Backup wizard offers two options:
• Full Backup: Click this radio button to perform your first backup or
when you’re writing files to a new media source.
• Incremental Backup: Use this option if you’ve already performed at
least one backup and you want to update the backed-up files.
3. Click Next and select a target location for your backed-up files.
Active drives, including CD/DVD drives attached to your computer, appear
in the Select Destination Drive list, as shown in Figure 2-39. Select a drive,
and Elements automatically assesses the write speed and identifies a
previous backup file if one was created. The total size of the files to copy is
reported in the wizard. This information is helpful so that you know
whether more than one CD or DVD is needed to complete the backup.
4. If you intend to copy files to your hard drive or to another hard 
drive attached to your computer, click the Browse button and identify
the path.
If you use a media source, such as a CD or DVD, Elements prompts you
to insert a disc and readies the media for writing.
5. Click Done, and the backup commences.
Be certain to not interrupt the backup. It might take some time, so just
let Elements work away until you’re notified that the backup is complete.
Figure 2-39: The wizard provides options for selecting the destination 
media for the backup.

Backing up photos and files
With files stored all over your hard drive, manually copying files to a second
hard drive, CD-ROM, or DVD would take quite a bit of time. Fortunately,
Elements makes finding files to back up a breeze.
Choose File➪Make a CD/DVD, and then in the dialog box that opens, click
Yes to confirm the action. The Make a CD/DVD dialog box then opens. Select
a hard drive or a CD/DVD drive, type a name for the backup folder, and click
OK. Elements goes about copying all files shown in the Organizer window to
your backup source.

hen you open a picture in Photoshop Elements, you’re looking at a
huge mass of pixels. These pixels are tiny, colored squares, and the
number of pixels in a picture determines the picture’s resolution. This rela-
tionship between pixels and resolution, which is important for you to under-
stand in all your Elements work, relates to creating selections (as we explain
in Book IV, Chapters 1 and 2), printing files (Book IX, Chapter 2), and sharing
files (Book IX, Chapter 4).
This chapter explains some essential points about resolution and image
sizes, especially in terms of how these aspects affect how you
end up modifying your images.
Examining Images Closely
Files you open in Elements are composed of mil-
lions of tiny, square pixels. Each pixel has one, and
only one, color value. The arrangement of the
pixels of different shades and colors creates an illu-
sion for your eyes when you’re viewing an image
onscreen. For example, you may have black and
white pixels arranged in an order that creates the
impression that you’re looking at something gray —
not at tiny black and white squares.

Examining Images Closely
150
Just about everything you do in Elements has to do with changing pixels.
You surround them with selection tools to select what appear to be objects
in your image; you make pixels darker or lighter to change contrast and
brightness; you change shades and tints of pixels for color correction; and
you perform a host of other possible editing tasks.
We also have another term to throw at you when talking about pixels and
Elements files: Your pictures are raster images. When you have pixels, you
have raster data. If you open a file in Elements that isn’t made of pixels,
Elements can rasterize the data. In other words, Elements can convert other
data to pixels if the document wasn’t originally composed of pixels.
In addition to raster data, there’s also vector data, which we talk more
about later in this chapter.
To use most of the tools and commands in Elements, you must be working
on a raster image file. If your data isn’t rasterized, many tools and com-
mands are unavailable.
Understanding resolution
The number of pixels in a file determines its image resolution. If you have 72
pixels across a 1-inch horizontal line, your image is 72 pixels per inch (ppi).
If you have 300 pixels in 1 inch, your image resolution is 300 ppi.
Image resolution is critical to properly outputting files in these instances:
 When you print images: If the resolution is too low, the image prints
poorly. If the image resolution is too high, you waste time processing all
the data that needs to be sent to your printer.
 When you show images onscreen: Just like images have resolution
inherent in their files, your computer monitor displays everything you
see on it in a fixed resolution. Computer monitors display images at 72
ppi (or 85 or 96 ppi). That’s all you get. What’s important to know is
that you can always best view photos on your computer monitor at a
72-ppi image size in a 100-percent view.
As an example, take a look at Figure 1-1. You see an image reduced to
50 percent and then at different zoom sizes. When the size changes, the
resolution display on your monitor changes. When the size is 100 per-
cent, you see the image exactly as it will print. The 100-percent size rep-
resents the image displayed on your monitor at 72 ppi, regardless of the
resolution of the file.

Examining Images Closely
151
Figure 1-1: The same image is viewed at different zoom levels.
This relationship between the image resolution and viewing the image at dif-
ferent zoom levels is an important concept to grasp. If you grab an image off
the Web and zoom in on it, you may see a view like the 800-percent view
shown in Figure 1-1. If you acquire a digital camera image, you may need to
zoom out to a 16-percent view to fit the entire image in the Image window.
The reason that these displays vary so much is all because of image resolu-
tion. That Web page image you grabbed off the Web might be a 2-inch-square
image at 72 ppi, and that digital camera image might be a 10-x-15-inch image
at 240 ppi. To fill the entire window with the Web image, you need to zoom
in on the file. When you zoom in, the resolution is lowered. The more you
zoom, the lower the resolution on your monitor.
When you zoom into or out of an image, you change the resolution as it
appears on your monitor. No resolution changes are made to the file. The
image resolution remains the same until you use one of the Elements tools
to reduce or add to image resolution.
Understanding image dimensions
Image dimensions involve the physical size of your file. If the size is 4 x 5
inches, for example, the file can be any number of different resolution
values. After the file is open in Elements, you can change the dimensions of
an image, the resolution, or both.

Specifying
Resolution 
and Changing 
Image Sizing

Using the Image Size Command
152
When you change only the dimensions of an image (not the number of pixels
it contains), an inverse relationship exists between the physical size of your
image and the resolution. When an image size is increased, resolution
decreases. Conversely, when you raise resolution, you lower image size.
Understanding camera megapixels
Digital camera image resolution is measured in megapixels (millions of
pixels) and is a factor in image size. If you have a 6-megapixel camera, the
full-resolution images from your camera are about 3000 x 2000 pixels. The
file size for a 6-megapixel image is about 5.7MB.
On the screen, the resolution of many digital camera images is 72 ppi (pixels
per inch). Using the 6-megapixel image as an example, the resolution at
72 ppi produces an image a little more than 41 x 27 inches. Regardless of
whether your camera takes pictures at 3, 5, or 8 megapixels, many images
are captured at 72 ppi, but the dimensions vary according to the total
number of pixels captured. With other cameras, you may find image resolu-
tions like 230 ppi or some other variation. The higher resolutions typically
produce images of smaller physical sizes.
Looking at raster versus vector images
Elements supports working with vector data in addition to raster data.
Whereas raster data carries with it a fixed resolution, vector objects are not
resolution dependent. What does this mean and, more important, what
advantages come from working with vector data?
A vector object might be a line of text or a shape you add to a photo from
an assortment of vector shapes. When you size text and shapes in Elements,
the resizing has no effect on resolution. In other words you can size up a
line of text or a shape as large as you want and when the photo is printed
the text and shapes print clearly without distortion. Text and shapes remain
resolution independent until you flatten the layers. Then, the shapes are
converted to pixels and appear as raster images.
Using the Image Size Command
In some cases, an image is too large, and you need to reduce its resolution
and physical size. In other cases, you might need a higher resolution to
output an image at a larger size. This method of sizing — changing the size,
as well as the number of pixels — is called resampling an image.

Using the Image Size Command
153
Specifically, reducing resolution is downsampling and raising resolution is
upsampling.
Use caution when you resample images; when you resample, you’re either
tossing away pixels or manufacturing new pixels — and neither activity par-
ticularly benefits image quality. We discuss the sampling details in the sec-
tion “Upsampling images,” later in this chapter.
Downsampling images
You can change an image’s size and resolution in a couple different ways.
One method involves cropping images. You can use the Crop tool with or
without resampling images. For more information on using the Crop tool,
see Book VIII, Chapter 1. Another method involves the Image Size dialog
box, which you use in many of your editing sessions in Elements.
When you use the Image Size dialog box to size an image down, you are
downsampling the image. Follow these steps to see how downsampling is
performed in Elements:
1. Open a photo in Full Edit mode.
Any photo you have handy can be used to follow the steps here.
2. Choose Image➪Resize➪Image Size.
Alternatively, you can use the key-
board shortcut Ctrl+Alt+I. The
Image Size dialog box opens, as
shown in Figure 1-2.
The Pixel Dimensions area in the
Image Size dialog box shows the
file size (such as 23.4M — M for
megabytes). This number is the
amount of space the image takes
up on your hard drive. The width
and height values are fixed unless
you click the Resample Image
check box at the bottom of the
dialog box.

3. In the Document Size area, you can redefine dimensions and
resolution. The options are
• Width: Type a value in the text box to resize the image’s width and
then press Tab to move out of the field to implement the change.
From the drop-down menu to the right of the text box, you can
choose a unit of measure: percent, inches, centimeters, millimeters,
points, picas, or columns.
• Height: The Height options are the same as the Width options except
there is no column setting. If you keep the sizing proportional — by
checking the Constrain Proportions check box — you typically edit
either the Width or Height text box, but not both. When you alter
either width or height, the resolution changes inversely.
• Resolution: Edit the text box to change resolution, and press the Tab
key to change the value. When resolution is edited, the Width and
Height values are changed inversely (if the Constrain Proportions
check box is checked).
4. If you’re okay with resampling your image to get the desired size,
select the Resample Image check box.
With this check box selected, you can change dimensions and pixels at
the same time, which results in reducing or increasing the number of
pixels. When the box is unchecked, the values for dimensions are
linked. Changing one value automatically changes the other values.
Before you resample your image, however, be sure to check out the fol-
lowing section.
5. If you select the Resample Image check box, you can choose a resam-
pling method, as well as other resample options.
In the drop-down list, you find resampling-method choices. See Table
1-1 for details. The two check boxes above the Resample Image check
box become active when you select the Resample Image box. Here’s
what they do:
• Scale Styles: Elements has a Styles panel from which you can add a
variety of different style effects to images. When you apply a style,
such as a frame border, the border appears at a defined width. When
you select the Scale Styles box and then resize the image, the Styles
effect is also resized. Leaving the check box unselected keeps the
style at the same size when the image is resized.
• Constrain Proportions: By default, this check box is selected, and you
want to keep it that way unless you want to intentionally distort an
image.

Upsampling images
As a general rule, reducing resolution is okay, but increasing resolution isn’t. If
you need a higher-resolution image and you can go back to the original source
(such as rescanning the image or reshooting a picture), try (if you can) to
create a new file that has the resolution you want instead of resampling in
Elements. In some cases, upsampled images can be severely degraded.
If you take a picture with a digital
camera and want to add the picture to
a Web page, the image needs to be
sampled at 72 ppi. In most cases, you
visit the Image Size dialog box, select
the Resample Image check box, add a
width or height value, and type 72 in
the Resolution text box. What you end
up with is an image that looks great on
your Web page. In Figure 1-3, you can
see an image that was downsampled in
Elements from more than 14 inches
horizontal width.

If you start with an image that was
originally sampled for a Web page and
you want to print a large poster, you
can forget about using Elements or
any other image editor. Upsampling
low-resolution images often turns
them to mush, as you can see in 
Figure 1-4.
You might wonder whether upsampling
can be used for any purpose. In some
cases, yes, you can upsample with
some satisfactory results. You can
experience better results with higher
resolutions of 300 ppi and more if the
resample size isn’t extraordinary. If all else fails, try applying a filter to a
grainy, upsampled image to mask the problem. Book VII, Chapter 1 has the
details on filters.
Some third-party tools do much better with upsampling images than the
built-in sampling tools provided by Elements. For starters, take a look at
OnOne Software’s Genuine Fractals (www.ononesoftware.com). When it is
absolutely necessary to upsample images, you’ll find favorable results using
this product.
Using the Scale Command
When you open a photo in Elements, the photo rests on a canvas. The
canvas and the photo are at a 1:1 ratio. In essence, the canvas is the physi-
cal size of your image. You can keep the canvas size fixed while upsizing or
downsizing the photo image. To do so requires using the Transformation
tools.
Select Image➪Transform➪Free Transform or press Ctrl+T, and you see a
number of handles on the sides of the transformation rectangle. To scale a
photo up or down, grab one of the four-corner handles and move it in or out
to size down or up, respectively.
Figure 1-4: Upsampling low-resolution
images often produces severely degraded
results.

Using the Scale Command
157
If you open a context menu after you’ve selected Free Transform, you find
several transformation commands as shown in Figure 1-5. Choose the Scale
command to size an image up or down. As you drag the corner handles, the
scaling is made while constraining proportions.
Figure 1-5: Press Ctrl+T and open a context menu to choose from 
different transformation commands.
The end result of scaling images is the same as using the Image Size dialog
box to upsample and downsample images. As you scale an image up, the
image loses resolution. As you scale an image down, it gains resolution.
Therefore, when scaling images up, be certain that the image resolution is
sufficient to support the new size. 
In Figure 1-6, we scaled the image up using the Scale command while main-
taining the same canvas size.

Choosing a Resolution for Print or Screen
The importance of resolution in your Elements work is paramount when
printing files. Good ol’ 72-ppi images can be forgiving, and you can get many
of your large files scrunched down to 72 ppi for Web sites and slideshows.
With output to printing devices, it’s another matter. There are many differ-
ent printing output devices, and their resolution requirements vary.
For your own desktop printer, plan to print a variety of test images at differ-
ent resolutions. You can quickly determine the best file attributes by run-
ning tests. When you send files to service centers, ask the technicians what
file attributes work best with their equipment.
For a starting point, look over the recommended resolutions for various
output devices listed in Table 1-2.

Changing the Canvas Size
When you scale images, you maintain the same canvas size. You might have
a canvas size that is set up for printing a photo such as 8 x 10 inches and
want to size an image up a little to make it a bit larger on the 8 x 10 canvas.
You might also add other images to create a photo collage and need to scale
images up or down, again keeping the same canvas size.
In other circumstances, you may want to keep the image size the same but
increase the canvas size to accommodate an area for type, some content
from the Content palette, or for additional images.
To increase the canvas size, choose
Image➪Resize➪Canvas Size. The
Canvas Size dialog box opens as
shown in Figure 1-7. In this dialog box,
you have several options to control,
such as
 Current Size: The display for the
Current Size shows you what your
original canvas size is when you
open the dialog box.
 Width: Type the new width in the
text box.
 Height: Type the new Height in
the text box.
 Relative: By default, the new size is absolute. Check this box if you want
the new size relative to the dimensions.
 Anchor: By default, the canvas is increased from the center out. For
example, if you have a 3 x 3 inch canvas area and you increase the size
to 5 x 5 inches, one inch of canvas is added to all four sides of the
photo. You can size the canvas relative to the photo from the top-left
corner, top, top-right corner, left side, right side, bottom-left corner,
bottom, or bottom-right corner by clicking one of the arrows shown in
the Anchor area.

egardless of what output you prepare your files for, you need to con-
sider color mode and file format. The most common color mode for
photos taken with a digital camera is RGB. This color mode is what you use
to prepare color files for printing on your desktop color printer or for send-
ing to photo service centers.
You can also use color modes other than RGB — bitmap or grayscale, for
example. If you start with an RGB color image and want to convert to a differ-
ent color mode, you have menu options for doing precisely that. Photoshop
Elements uses an algorithm (a mathematical formula) to convert pixels from
one mode to another. In some cases, the conversion that’s made via
a menu command produces good results; in other cases, you
can use some different options for converting modes.
In this chapter, we introduce the modes that are avail-
able in Elements and explain how to convert from
RGB to the mode of your choice: bitmap, grayscale,
or indexed color. File formats are also somewhat
dependent on which color mode you choose for
your files, so we tossed in a discussion about
saving files in this chapter.
Selecting a Color Mode
When you open an image from a digital camera or scan an
image, the image file contains a color mode. Typically, digital
camera images are in RGB (red, green, blue) color mode. When you
scan documents and photos on a scanner, you can choose from among line
art (bitmap mode), grayscale, or RGB color. 

Converting Color Modes and Profiles
162
Another mode you may have heard of is CMYK. Although CMYK mode isn’t
available in Photoshop Elements, you should be aware of it and its uses.
CMYK, commonly referred to as process color, contains percentages of cyan,
magenta, yellow, and black colors. This mode is used for commercial print-
ing. If you design a magazine cover in Elements and send the file to a print
shop, the file is ultimately converted to CMYK. Also note that most desktop
printers use different ink sets within the CMYK color space.
If you start in Full Edit mode and create
a new blank document, you have
a choice for defining the color mode of
the new document. Choose File➪
New➪Blank File and the New dialog
box opens, as shown in Figure 2-1. At
the bottom of the dialog box, you make
a choice for the color mode from the
Color Mode drop-down list.
When choosing a color mode, the
options you have for importing images
from digital camera shots, scanning
images, and creating new documents are limited to the modes discussed
thus far. To explore other modes or change a mode, you need to work with
menu commands for converting color.
Converting Color Modes and Profiles
The most common scenario for photographers and users of Photoshop
Elements is to start out with an RGB color image. This color mode is the
center of your mode universe and from here you can convert from RGB to
other color modes.
Converting to Bitmap mode
Bitmap mode is most commonly used in printing line art, such as black-and-
white logos, illustrations, or black-and-white effects that you create from
your RGB images. Also, you can scan your analog signature as a bitmap
image and import it into other programs, such as Microsoft Office pro-
grams. If you’re creative, you can combine bitmap images with RGB color to
produce many interesting effects.
Figure 2-1: Choose FileÍNewÍBlank File to 
open the New dialog box.

Converting Color Modes and Profiles
163
The Elements Bitmap mode isn’t the same as the Windows BMP file format.
In Elements, Bitmap mode is a color mode with only two color values —
black and white. A Windows BMP file can be an RGB color mode image, a
Grayscale color mode image, or a Bitmap color mode image.
Keep in mind when working with color modes that when you combine
images into single documents, (as we explain throughout Book VI), you need
to convert bitmap files to grayscale or color if you want to merge the images
with an RGB image. If you convert to grayscale, Elements takes care of con-
verting grayscale to RGB mode.
For an example of what happens when
you combine grayscale and color
images, look over Figure 2-2. The origi-
nal RGB image was converted to a
bitmap and then saved as a different
file. The bitmap was converted to
grayscale and dropped on top of the
RGB image. After adjusting the opacity,
the result is a grainy effect with desat-
urated color. For more information 
on how to merge files, create layers,
and blend layer opacity, see Book VI,
Chapters 1 to 3.
You can acquire Bitmap mode images
directly in Elements when you scan
images that are black and white.
Illustrated art, logos, your signature, or
a copy of a fax might be the kind of
files you scan directly in Bitmap mode.
Additionally, you can convert your
RGB color images to Bitmap mode.
Converting RGB color to bitmap is a
two-step process. You first convert to
grayscale and then convert from
grayscale to bitmap. If you select the
Bitmap menu command while in RGB color, Elements prompts you to con-
vert to grayscale first.

To convert RGB mode to Bitmap mode, do the following:
1. Open an image that you want to convert to Bitmap mode in either
Full Edit or Quick Edit mode.
2. Choose Image➪Mode➪Bitmap.
If you start in RGB mode, Elements prompts you to convert to grayscale.
3. Click OK, and the Bitmap dialog box opens.
The Bitmap dialog box provides options for selecting the output resolu-
tion and a conversion method.
4. Select a resolution.
By default, the Bitmap dialog box,
as shown in Figure 2-3, displays the
current resolution. You can edit the
text box and type a new resolution
value or accept the default.
5. Under the Method heading, select
one of the following settings from
the Use drop-down menu: 
• 50% Threshold
• Pattern Dither
• Diffusion Dither
Look over Figure 2-4 to see a com-
parison of the different methods
used in converting RGB images to bitmaps.
6. Click OK to convert your image to Bitmap mode.
Converting to Grayscale mode
Grayscale images have black-and-white pixels and any one of 256 levels of
gray. By converting an RGB image to grayscale, you can make it look like a
black-and-white photo.
We talk about 256 gray levels in many chapters in this book. An RGB color
image is divided into three separate channels (one for red, one for green,
and one for blue). Each of these channels contains 256 levels of grays.
Adjusting the levels of grays has an effect on the brightness and color in
your images. Look over Book VIII, Chapter 2 to understand more about the
gray levels and adjusting them in Photoshop Elements.
Figure 2-3: Type a resolution for your
output and select the conversion method
from the Use drop-down menu.

Figure 2-4: An original RGB image converted to bitmap by using 
50% Threshold, Pattern Dither, and Diffusion Dither.
You can convert an image to grayscale in one of three ways, but we’re here
to tell you that one of these methods isn’t as good as the others. In other
words, avoid converting to grayscale by choosing Image➪Mode➪Grayscale.
When Elements performs this conversion, it removes all the color from the
pixels, so you lose some precious data during the conversion. You can’t
regain this color after conversion. If you use the Image➪Mode➪Grayscale
command sequence to convert an image to grayscale, and then save the file
and delete the original from your hard drive or memory card, the color
image is lost forever. You can save a secondary file, but this method is con-
fusing and requires some more space on your hard drive.
As an alternative to using the menu command for converting images to
grayscale, follow these steps:
1. Open an RGB image in Elements.
2. Duplicate a layer.
The default Project Bin contains the Layers panel. In this panel, you find
a pop-up menu when you click More in the upper-right corner. From the
menu commands, choose Duplicate Layer. (For more information on
working with layers, see Book VI, Chapter 1.) After duplicating the layer,
you see a thumbnail of another layer in the Layers panel.

3. Choose Enhance➪Adjust
Color➪Adjust Hue/Saturation (or
press Ctrl+U) to open the
Hue/Saturation dialog box,
shown in Figure 2-5.
4. Drag the Saturation slider to the
far left to desaturate the image.
All color disappears, but the
brightness values of all the pixels
remain unaffected. (For more
information on using the Hue/
Saturation dialog box and the
other Adjust Color commands, see
Book VIII, Chapter 2.)
5. Turn off the color layer by click-
ing the Eye icon.
In the Layers panel, you see two
layers, as shown in Figure 2-6. You
don’t need to turn off the color
layer to print the file in grayscale,
but turning it off can help you
remember which color layer you
used the last time you printed or
exported the file.
Following the preceding steps provides
you with a file that contains both RGB
and grayscale. If you want to print the
color layer, you can turn off the
grayscale layer. If you need to exchange
files with graphic designers, you can
send the layered file, and then the
design professional can use both the
color image and the grayscale image.
The other advantage of converting
RGB color to grayscale by using the
Hue/Saturation dialog box is that you
don’t cause any changes in the bright-
ness values of the pixels. Moving the Saturation slider to desaturate the
image affects only the color. The luminance and lightness values remain
the same.
Figure 2-5: Open the Hue/Saturation
dialog box and move the Saturation slider
to the far left to eliminate color.
Figure 2-6: The Layers panel shows the
grayscale and color layers. You can turn
layers on or off by clicking the Eye icon.

Converting Color Modes and Profiles
167
Another choice you have for converting color to black-and-white photos is
to use the Convert to Black and White dialog box. Choose Enhance➪
Convert to Black and White in either Edit mode or Quick Edit mode, and you
see the Convert to Black and White dialog box shown in Figure 2-7.
Figure 2-7: The Convert to Black and White dialog box.
This dialog box contains many controls for adjusting brightness and contrast
in images that you convert to grayscale. You can select from some preset
options in the Select a Style list. You move the sliders in the Adjustment
Intensity area and view a dynamic preview in the After thumbnail area.
If you want to keep your original RGB image in the same file as the grayscale
version, duplicate the background by choosing Duplicate Layer from the
More menu on the Layers panel. Click the background and choose Enhance➪
Convert to Black and White. The conversion is applied only to the back-
ground, leaving the Background copy layer in the original color mode.
Converting to Indexed Color mode
Indexed color is a mode you use occasionally with Web graphics, such as
saving in GIF format or PNG-8. When saving indexed-color images, you can
often create smaller file sizes than using RGB. These are ideal for using in
Web-site designs.
Book III
Chapter 2
Choosing Color
Modes and
File Formats

Converting Color Modes and Profiles
168
RGB images in 24-bit color (8 bits per channel) are capable of rendering
colors from a palette of 16.7 million colors. An indexed color image is an 
8-bit image with only a single channel. The total number of colors you get
with indexed color can be no more than 256. When you convert RGB images
to indexed color, you can choose to dither the color, which displays the
image with a dithered effect much like the effect you see with bitmapped
images. This dithering effect makes the file appear as though it has more
than 256 colors, and the transition between colors appears smoother than
if no dithering is applied.
On occasion, indexed-color images have an advantage over RGB images when
you are hosting the images on Web servers: The fewer colors in a file, the
smaller the file size. When you prepare images for Web hosting, you can
choose to use indexed color or RGB color. Whether you choose one over the
other really depends on the quality of the image as it appears on your moni-
tor. If you have some photos that you want to show on Web pages, you should
use RGB images and save them in a format appropriate for Web hosting, as we
explain in the section “Saving files for the Web,” later in this chapter.
If you have files composed of artwork, such as logos, illustrations, and
drawings, you may find that the appearance of images using index colors is
no different from the same images as RGB. If that’s the case, you can keep
the index-color image and use it for your Web pages.
To convert RGB images to indexed color, choose Image➪Mode➪Indexed
Color; the Indexed Color dialog box opens. A number of different options
are available to you, and fortunately, you can preview the results while you
make choices. Get in and poke around. You can see the options applied in
the Image window.
Converting color profiles
Because we’re talking about color conversions in this chapter, we’ll also
cover a little bit about color profiles (and converting color profiles). But for a
much more thorough discussion on color profiles, jump ahead to Chapter 4
in this book.
You may open an image containing an embedded color profile such as the
one shown later in Figure 2-8. In Figure 2-8, the embedded profile is shown
in the Save As dialog box as ColorMatchRGB. That color profile isn’t avail-
able in Photoshop Elements, but it was embedded in another program sup-
porting profile embedding for the ColorMatchRGB profile.
Photoshop Elements supports two-color profiles for embedding in a photo.
The Adobe RGB profile uses a slightly larger color gamut (more available
colors) than the other profile: sRGB. Some printing devices work best when

Using the Proper File Format
169
converting sRGB color to the printer’s color. In other cases, Adobe RGB is
better supported by some printers. This is a nutshell view of color profiling
for printing. For more detailed information see Book IX, Chapter 3.
Going back to Figure 2-8, if we want to print the file to a printer, we might
want to convert the color profile. To do so, you choose Image➪Convert Color
Profile and then make a choice from the submenu. Your options include
 Remove Profile. Choosing this option removes color profiles from the
image.
 Apply sRGB Profile. This choice applies the sRGB profile to the image.
 Apply Adobe RGB. This option applies the Adobe RGB color profile to
the image.
Choosing one of the options either removes a color profile or converts to
the selected color profile. When you save your file, you have the option to
embed the profile in the image.
Using the Proper File Format
As you make edits on files, be sure you frequently save to update the work
performed in an editing session. Continue saving as your work progresses to
ensure against data loss.
Photoshop Elements files can be saved in a variety of different formats. Some
format types require you to convert a color mode before the format can be
used. Therefore, a relationship exists between file color modes and saving
files in formats supporting the color modes. Additionally, bit depths in
images also relate to the kinds of file formats you can use when saving files.
Before you go too far in Elements, become familiar with file formats and the
conversions necessary to save in one format or another. If you do nothing to
an image in terms of converting modes or changing bit depth, you can save
a file after editing in the same format in which the file was opened. In many
circumstances, you open an image and prepare it for some form of output,
which requires more thought about the kind of file format you use when
saving the file.
Using the Save/Save As dialog box
In most any program, the Save (or Save As) dialog box is a familiar place
where you make some choices about the file to be saved. With Save As, you
can save a duplicate copy of your image or a modified copy and retain the
original file.

To use the Save (or Save As) dialog

The standard navigational tools you

ent from other Save dialog boxes that you might be accustomed to using.
The Save Options area in the Save As dialog box provides these choices:
 Include in the Organizer: If you want the file added to the Organizer,

from Quick Edit mode, this check box is active. Select the box to save a
version of the original, which appears in the Organizer.
 Color: Check the box for ICC (International Color Consortium) Profile.
Depending on which profile you’re using, the option appears for sRGB or
Adobe RGB (1998). When the check box is selected, the profile is embed-
ded in the image. See “Converting Color Modes and Profiles,” earlier in
this chapter.
 Thumbnail: If you save a file with a thumbnail, you can see a miniature
representation of your image when viewing it in folders or on the desk-
top. If you select Ask When Saving in the Saving Files preferences, the
check box can be enabled or disabled. If you select an option for Never
Save or Always Save in the Preferences dialog box, this box is enabled
or disabled (and grayed out). You need to return to the Preferences
dialog box if you want to change the option.

 Use Lower Case Extension: File extensions give you a clue to which file
format was used when a file was saved. Elements automatically adds the
extension to the filename for you. Your choices are to use uppercase or
lowercase letters for the extension name. Select the check box for Use
Lower Case Extension for lowercase or deselect the check box if you
want to use uppercase characters in the filename.
Understanding file formats
When you save files from Elements, you pick a file format in the Format
drop-down menu found in both the Save and Save As dialog boxes.
When you choose from the different format options, keep the following
information in mind:
 File formats are especially important when you exchange files with
other users. Each format has a purpose, and other programs can accept
or reject files depending on the format you choose.
 Whether you can select one format or another for saving a file depends
on the color mode, the bit depth, and whether layers are present. If a
format isn’t present in the Format drop-down menu when you attempt
to save a file, return to one of the edit modes and perform some kind of
edit, such as changing a color mode or flattening layers, in order to save
the file in your chosen format.
For a glimpse at all the file formats
available to you, open a standard RGB
color image in Standard Edit mode,
choose File➪Save As, and click the
down arrow to open the Format drop-
down menu. As you can see in Figure
2-9, you have many format options.
In the following sections, we explain
most of the file formats supported by
Elements and the purpose for each
format.
Photoshop (*.PSD, *.PDD)
This format is the native file format
for both Photoshop and Photoshop
Elements. The format supports saving
all color modes and bit depths, and

Modes and
File Formats
Figure 2-9: Open the Format drop-down
menu in either the Save or Save As dialog
box to make the formats supported by
Elements appear.

Using the Proper File Format
172
you can preserve layers. Use this format when you want to save in a native
format or exchange files with Photoshop users. Also use it for saving files
that you need to return to for more editing. When you save layers, any text
you add to layers can be edited when you return to the file. (See Book V,
Chapter 3 for more information on adding text to an image.)
BMP (*.BMP, *.RLE, *.DIB)
The term bitmap can be a little confusing. You have both a file format type
that’s bitmap and a color mode that’s also bitmap. Don’t confuse the two. The
bitmap format supports saving in all color modes and in all bit depths. The
Bitmap color mode, which we cover in the section “Converting to Bitmap
mode,” earlier in this chapter, is 1-bit black and white only.
Use the bitmap format when you want to add images to system resources,
such as wallpaper for your desktop. Bitmap is also used with many different
application programs. If you can’t import images in other program docu-
ments, try to save them as BMP files.
CompuServe GIF (*.GIF)
Back when CompuServe was the host for our e-mail accounts, Barb was a
college coed and Ted had a mustache and wore a green leisure suit. We
exchanged files and mail on 300-baud modems. Later, in 1987, CompuServe
developed GIF (Graphics Interchange Format) to exchange files between
mainframe computers and the ever-growing number of users working on
Osborne, Kaypro, Apple, and Radio Shack TRS-80 computers.
GIF is now a popular format for hosting Web graphics. GIF images can be
indexed color or animated images, and they support the smallest file sizes.
Use this format when you need fewer than 256 colors and want to create
animation in your images.
Photo Project Format (*.PSE)
Use this option when you create a project and want to save the file as a proj-
ect. See Book IX, Chapter 1 for more on creating projects in Elements.
Photoshop EPS (*.EPS)
Photoshop EPS (Encapsulated PostScript) files are sometimes used by
graphic artists when they’re designing jobs for commercial printing. The
more popular format for creative professionals is TIFF, but Photoshop EPS
has some advantages not found in other formats.

Using the Proper File Format
173
Depending on the color mode of your
image, you have different options when
you’re using the Photoshop EPS file
format. Select the format in the
Save/Save As dialog box and click Save.
If you’re working on a bitmap image (1
bit), the EPS Options dialog box, as
shown in Figure 2-10, opens. It offers an
option to save transparency wherever
white appears in your document.
Notice the Transparent Whites check
box. You might have a circular logo, and you want the area around the circle
to appear transparent. If you import the graphical image in another pro-
gram, you can see the black in the image, but all the white area is transpar-
ent and shows any background through what was white in the original
bitmap image. If you save a file in a higher bit depth, the EPS Options dialog
box doesn’t provide an option for making whites transparent.
JPEG (*.JPG, *.JPEG, *.JPE)
JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) is perhaps the most common file
format now in use. JPEG files are used with e-mail attachments and by many
photo labs for printing files, and they can be viewed in JPEG viewers and
directly in Web browsers. Just about every program capable of importing
images supports the JPEG format. Creative professionals wouldn’t dream of
using the JPEG format in design layouts, but everyone else uses the format
for all kinds of documents.
You need to exercise some caution when you’re using the JPEG format. 
JPEG files are compressed to reduce file size. You can scrunch an image of
several megabytes into a few hundred kilobytes. When you save a file with
JPEG compression, you experience data loss. You might not see this on your
monitor, or it might appear noticeably on photo prints if you’re using low
compression while preserving higher quality. However, when you save with
maximum compression, more pixels are tossed away, and you definitely
notice image degradation.
When you save, open, and resave images in JPEG format, each new save
degrades an image more. When you submit JPEG images to photo labs for
printing your pictures, keep saving in Photoshop PSD file format until you’re
ready to save the final image. Save in JPEG format when you want to save
the final file for printing and use a low compression with high quality.

File Formats
Figure 2-10: When you’re working on 1-
bit bitmap images, this dialog box offers an
option to save transparency where white
appears in the document.

Using the Proper File Format
174
When you select JPEG for the format
and click Save, the JPEG Options
dialog box opens, as shown in Figure
2-11. You choose the amount of com-
pression by typing a value in the
Quality text box or by moving the
slider below the Quality text box. The
acceptable ranges are from 0 to 12 — 0
is the lowest quality and results in the
highest compression, and 12 is the
highest quality that results in the
lowest amount of compression.
Notice that you also have choices in
the Format Options section of the
JPEG Options dialog box. The
Progressive option creates a progres-
sive JPEG file commonly used with
Web browsers. This file type shows progressive quality while the file down-
loads from a Web site. The image first appears in a low-quality view and
shows higher-resolution views until the image appears at full resolution
when it’s completely downloaded in your browser window.
JPEG 2000 (*.JPF, *.JPX, *.JP2, *. J2K, *.JPC)
JPEG 2000 is a newer JPEG file format. This format offers you the same
mode quality as the JPEG format and has an option to save the file with
compression without tossing away pixels. You get lossless compression. The
JPEG 2000 dialog box shows you, right in the dialog box and before you save
the image, the results of the choices you make regarding the file size.
To save images in JPEG format for your commercial photo lab, check with
the technicians and ask whether they support JPEG 2000. If so, save your
files in this format with a lossless compression. When files are compressed
with lossless compression, you can expect to lose about two-thirds of the
original file size. For example, a 6MB file can be reduced to about 2MB when
it’s saved as JPEG 2000 in a lossless-compression format. Note that if you
save files in JPEG 2000 format for the Web, Web browsers need to have a
plug-in to see the images.
Figure 2-11: When saving in JPEG format,
choose the amount of compression you
want to apply to the saved image.

PCX (*.PCX)
PCX is a native PC format first used with PC Paintbrush. Most programs now
support newer file formats, and you’re not likely to need to save in PCX
format. If you have legacy files from years ago, you can open PCX files in
Elements, edit them, and save them in a newer format.
Photoshop PDF (*.PDF, *.PDP)
Adobe PDF (Portable Document Format) is designed to maintain document
integrity when exchanging files between computers. PDF is one of the most
popular formats and can be viewed in the free Adobe Reader program avail-
able for installation on your Elements CD installer or by downloading it from
the Adobe Web site.
PDF is everywhere in Elements. When you jump into Organize mode and
create slide presentations, cards, and calendars, for example, you can
export your documents as PDF files. When you save in Photoshop PDF
format, you can preserve layers and text. Text is recognizable in Adobe
Reader (or other Acrobat viewers) and can be searched by using the
Reader’s Find and Search tools.
PDF files can be printed, hosted on Web sites, and exchanged with users
of Windows, Macintosh, Unix, and Linux. All in all, this format is well suited
for all the files you create in Elements that contain text, layers, and trans-
parency. It is also ideal when you want to exchange files with users who
don’t have Elements or Photoshop.
Photoshop Raw (*.RAW)
This format is used to exchange files between Windows and Mac users and
mainframe computers. Unless you prepare files to be viewed on mainframes,
don’t bother saving in this format.
With the advent of digital cameras, a Camera Raw format was introduced
by Adobe and all the developers of digital cameras. Camera Raw should not
be confused with Photoshop Raw. Photoshop Raw was introduced in 1989
with the first version on Adobe Photoshop. It was specifically designed for
exchanging files between microcomputers and mainframe systems. It has
nothing to do with Camera Raw and is a much older format seldom used
today.

PICT File (*.PCT, *.PICT)
PICT (Picture) format is an Apple file format similar to PCX on Windows.
This format originated with the 1984 introduction of the Macintosh and the
MacDraw program. This format is not used much today by any applications
or output devices.
Pixar (*.PXR)
This format is used for exchanging files with Pixar workstations.
PNG (*.PNG)
PNG (Portable Network Graphics) is another format used with Web pages.
PNG supports all color modes, 24-bit images, and transparency. Some older
browsers, however, may need a plug-in to see PNG files on Web pages. One
disadvantage of using PNG is that color profiles can’t be embedded in the
images, as they can be with JPEG.
Scitex CT (*.SCT)
The Scitex Continuous Tone (CT) format is used by Scitex workstations in
commercial printing environments.
Targa (*.TGA, *.VDA, *.ICB, *.VST)
Targa is a format for describing bitmap images and is capable of represent-
ing bitmaps from black and white, indexed color, and RGB color. It’s used for
applications that can read Targa files, such as Truevision’s hardware.
TIFF (*.TIF, *.TIFF)
TIFF (Tagged Image File Format) is the most common format used by
graphic designers. TIFF is generally used for importing images in profes-
sional layout programs, such as Adobe InDesign and Adobe PageMaker.
Commercial photo labs and print shops use equipment that supports down-
loading TIFF files directly to their devices. (Note: Direct downloads are used
in lieu of opening a Print dialog box.)
Inasmuch as creative professionals have used TIFF for so long, a better
choice for designers using a program such as Adobe InDesign is saving in
the native Photoshop PSD file format. This requires a creative professional
to save only one file in native format without bothering to save both native
and TIFF formats.

Using the Proper File Format
177
TIFF, along with Photoshop PSD and Photoshop PDF, supports saving layered 
files and works in all color modes. When you save in TIFF format, you can
also compress files in several different compression schemes. Compression
with TIFF files doesn’t lose data unless you choose a JPEG compression.
When you select TIFF for the format
and click Save in the Save/Save As
dialog box, the TIFF Options dialog box
opens, as shown in Figure 2-12.
In the Image Compression area, you
have these choices:
 NONE: Selecting this option
results in no compression. You use
this option when sending files to
professionals who are creating lay-
outs in programs such as Adobe
InDesign. None of the compression
schemes in the following bullets is
recommended for printing files to
commercial printing devices.
 LZW: This lossless compression
scheme results in much lower file
sizes without destroying data.
 ZIP: ZIP is also a lossless compres-
sion scheme. You can favor ZIP
compression over LZW when you
have large areas of the same color
in an image.
 JPEG: JPEG is lossy and results in the smallest file sizes. Use of JPEG
here is the same as when you apply JPEG compression with files saved
in the JPEG format.
File formats at a glance
We’ve been working with Photoshop, which saves in the same formats listed in
this section since 1989. To date, we have never used all the formats available in
Photoshop Elements. At most, you might use three or four of these formats.

You don’t need to remember all the formats and what they do. Just pick the
ones you use in your workflow, mark Table 2-1 for reference, and refer to it
from time to time until you have a complete understanding of how files
must be prepared in order to save them in various formats. If you happen to
receive a file from another user in one of the formats you don’t use, come
back to the description in this chapter when you need some detail on what
the format is used for.

**CompuServe GIF doesn’t support saving layers, although it supports saving layers as frames. You use
the frames when creating an animated GIF file used for Web pages.
Saving files for the Web
You save files for Web hosting in a different dialog box than when you’re
saving files for other output. Before saving a file, it’s best to set the physical
size and resolution before saving the file. Inasmuch as you can optimize files
in the Save for Web dialog box, it is much easier to first set up the physical
dimensions and resolution before opening the Save for Web dialog box. Use
the Image➪Resize➪Image Size dialog box and adjust the dimensions and
resolution. For Web graphics, choose a resolution such as 72 ppi and resam-
ple images down if necessary.
After your image is resized, choose File➪Save for Web or press Ctrl/Ô+Alt/
Option+Shift to open the Save for Web dialog box, as shown in Figure 2-13.
As you can see, you have a lot of things to control in this dialog box. The
settings include
A. Hand tool. When you are zoomed in on the Preview, use the Hand tool
to move the image around the Preview area.
B. Zoom tool. Click the Zoom tool on one preview image to zoom in to
both previews. Press the Alt/Option key to zoom out.
C. Eyedropper tool. Sample a color in the image shown in the Preview area.
D. Eyedropper Color. This choice contains the current sampled color.
Whatever color you sample can be used for the Matte. See item L later

hen you work with digital photos in Elements, the file format of your
images is an important point to consider. You choose this format
before you take your pictures, and the format is carried over to your com-
puter when you pull images off your camera.
The most common file formats that digital cameras offer are JPEG, TIFF, and
Camera Raw. Some cameras offer other options, but these formats are the
most common. Low-cost, point-and-shoot cameras offer you only the JPEG
format. The more-expensive cameras, including the SLR types, offer you
both JPEG and Camera Raw; some cameras offer JPEG and/or TIFF, and
Camera Raw.
This chapter aims to give you an understanding of how to
work with Camera Raw files.
Understanding Camera Raw
Cameras that produce JPEG images process images
with JPEG compression before saving them. It’s as
though your camera performs a darkroom method
of film processing when the shot is taken.
The Camera Raw format provides you with an optimum
image for editing in Elements. When a Camera Raw image
is saved to a media source, all the information the sensor
captured is saved with the file. These images are post-processed
when you open them. (See the “Opening Camera Raw Files” section,
later in this chapter, to find out about opening Camera Raw images.) For
example, you can open a Camera Raw image and, before the image opens in

Understanding Camera Raw
184
Elements, you can adjust temperature, exposure, and a bunch of other
settings — hence processing the photo after the shot was taken.
You can return to the original Camera Raw file and change the temperature
or exposure, for example, to open the file with different settings. Just like
chemical temperature and development time affect analog film processing,
similar options affect post-processing Camera Raw images. The difference
between analog film and Camera Raw is that after the analog film is
processed, you can’t change the processing attributes. With Camera Raw,
you can go back and post-process the image 100 times or more and change
the processing attributes each time.
Camera Raw also supports higher-bit-depth images than JPEG files do. In
Book III, Chapter 4 we talk about 8-bit and 16-bit images, including some of
the advantages of using 16-bit images. Camera Raw files typically produce
these higher bit-depth images that give you more flexibility when editing
brightness, contrast, and color.
If you have a choice between just JPEG and both JPEG and Camera Raw,
always choose the latter. You have much more editing control over your
images, and ultimately, you get better results.
Processing Camera Raw files
If you don’t have a camera capable of capturing Camera Raw images, you
might want to look over the following sections to understand how this file
format could benefit you. If you then end up purchasing a camera equipped
with Camera Raw support, you already have some understanding of the
advantages of using this format. (If you already have a Camera Raw-enabled
camera, you don’t need any convincing!)
Camera Raw images enable you to post-process your pictures. When you
take a picture with a digital camera in Camera Raw format, the camera’s
sensor records as much information as it can. When you open a Camera Raw
file in Elements, you decide what part of that data is opened as a new image.
Suppose that your camera is set for exposure in tungsten lighting, which is
used with tungsten flash photography in a studio. If you take this camera
outside in daylight and shoot an image, all your images appear with a blue
cast because tungsten lighting requires a cooler temperature than daylight.
If you acquire images that are saved in JPEG format, you need to do a lot of
color correction after the image opens in Elements. If you shoot the image
in Camera Raw format, you just process the image with a warmer tempera-
ture (consistent with conditions when the shot was taken), and your color
correction in Elements is a fraction of what it takes to fix a JPEG image.

Understanding Camera Raw
185
Post-processing Camera Raw images requires a plug-in that’s installed
with Photoshop Elements. When you open a Camera Raw image, the Camera
Raw plug-in takes over and provides you with a huge set of options for post-
processing the image before you open it in one of the Elements editors.
Each camera developer uses a different flavor of Camera Raw, and some
developers use different Camera Raw formats in different models in their
product line. Although Adobe tries to keep up with all the various Raw
formats, you may find a camera using a format not supported by the Raw
plug-in. Be sure to check updates online for Photoshop Elements. As new
developments occur, Adobe makes an effort to update plug-ins to support
newer formats.
Acquiring Camera Raw images
If you read through Chapters 1 and 2 in Book II, you know how to acquire
images from your camera and copy them to your hard drive. We don’t bother
going through those steps again; we just assume that you have some Camera
Raw images on your hard drive. That’s where you want them, anyway.
Opening files from your hard drive is much faster than working off media
cards.
To open a Camera Raw image, follow these steps:
1. From within Elements, open the image by pressing Ctrl/Ô+O and
selecting it in the Open dialog box.
If you want to select several images in a row, click the first image, hold
down the Shift key, and then click the last image. If you want to select
several nonadjacent images, Ctrl/Ô-click each image.
As an alternative, if you imported images from a media card to your hard
drive via the Organizer and have Camera Raw images in the Organizer
window, select an image and choose Editor➪Full Edit (in the Options
Bar) or press Ctrl/Ô+I to open the converted raw file in Full Edit mode.
2. Click Open in the Open dialog box.
If you’re selecting multiple images, only one image appears in the Camera
Raw dialog box while thumbnails of all selected files appear in a scrollable
list on the left side of the Camera Raw dialog box, as shown in Figure 3-1.
When you click Open, the next image in the list opens in the Camera Raw
dialog box.
As you can see in Figure 3-1, you can use a vast number of options to
post-process your image before you drop it into Elements. This window
is like a digital darkroom, where you can process the film and see what
you’re doing to the image before you accept the changes.

Figure 3-1: Open a Camera Raw image, and the image opens in the Camera Raw plug-in
window.
3. Choose from the options to post-process your images.
If you have your monitor properly calibrated, as we explain in Book III,
Chapter 4, all the adjustments you make for Camera Raw format are
dynamically updated in the Image preview. Don’t be shy. Poke around
and adjust settings to see the results in the Preview area. The more you
play with the settings, the more you find out how to get the best out of
Camera Raw.
The Camera Raw window has a large number of settings, as the following
list describes; mark this section to refer to when you work with Camera Raw
images:
 Tools: Nine tools appear in the window:
• Zoom: This tool zooms in and out of the Image preview.
• Hand: This option moves the image around, just as it does in the
Elements’ Image window.

Understanding Camera Raw

• Eyedropper: This samples color in the image. We cover using the
Elements’ Eyedropper tools in Book III, Chapter 2, and that informa-
tion also applies to using the Eyedropper in the Camera Raw
window.
• Crop tool: Draw a marquee with the Crop tool and make your color
and brightness adjustments. The adjustments are applied only to
the area defined by the Crop tool. When you click Open Image, the
photo opens cropped to the area you marked with the Crop tool.
• Straighten tool: The Straighten tool enables you to draw a horizontal
axis to straighten a crooked photo.
• Red Eye Removal: Click the Red Eye Removal tool to remove red-eye
caused by flash lighting.
• Open Preferences dialog box (Ctrl/Command+K): Click this tool to
open the Camera Raw Preferences dialog box, where you can make
some choices for saving image settings, change default image set-
tings, and use the Adobe Digital Negative (DNG) format.
• Rotate Left: Used to rotate the image counterclockwise.
• Rotate Right: The last tool you see below the Title bar is used to
rotate the image clockwise.
The last two rotation tools are self-explanatory.
 Preview: Check the box to show dynamic previews of your edits.
 Shadow/Highlight Clipping: The
Shadow and Highlight buttons
above the histogram (denoted by
the up-pointing arrows) show clip-
ping in the shadows (dark areas of
the image) and highlights (light
areas of the image). Clipping
means that, in a certain area, some
data and, ultimately, some detail
have been lost from the image.
Think of clipping as something
that you don’t want to appear in
your pictures. When you make
adjustments with these two check
boxes selected, shadow clipping is shown in blue and highlight clipping
is shown in red in the Image preview. Take a look at Figure 3-2, in which
we exaggerate clipping to show how the Clipping preview appears.

 RGB values: These values appear below the histogram. When you first
open an image, you don’t see any values in the RGB area. Click the
Zoom tool, the Hand tool, or the Eyedropper tool and move the cursor
over the Image preview. When you move any of these tools around the
image, the RGB values corresponding to the point below the cursor are
reported in this area.
 Histogram: This graph displays all three channels (red, green, and blue)
in an image simultaneously. The histogram changes when you change
other options in the Camera Raw window.
The histogram graphs how pixels in an image are distributed. The dis-
tribution includes the number of pixels at each color-intensity level
(one of the 256 levels you can find out about in Book VIII, Chapter 2).
If images have pixels concentrated
in the shadows, you see the his-
togram skewed to the left.
Conversely, images with pixels con-
centrated in the highlights reveal a
histogram skewed to the right.
When you begin to understand his-
tograms better, you can develop
your skill to the point where a
quick glance at the histogram pro-
vides you with a clue to what
adjustments you need to make to
improve images.
 Detail icons: The three icons
change the pane below the
Histogram from Basic (shown in
Figure 3-1) to Detail where you
apply sharpening and noise reduc-
tion (as shown in Figure 3-3) to
Camera Calibration where you can
select a camera profile.
 Settings (pop-up menu): This pop-
up menu opens when you click the
small icon on the far right of the
Basic tab. From this menu, you
have choices for applying settings
to the open image. If you change
any setting, the menu option
changes to Custom. If you previ-
ously made setting choices on a
Camera Raw image and want to
return to the shot as it was taken
by the camera, open the image and select Camera Raw Defaults.
Figure 3-3: Click the Triangle icon below
the histogram to open the Detail tab, which
includes options for sharpness and noise
reduction.

• Previous Conversion: This selection is handy if you have a collection
of images that all require the same settings. After adjusting the first
image, open additional images and select Previous Conversion. The
Camera Raw plug-in applies the last settings you made to a Camera
Raw image to the currently open file.
• Sharpening sharpens images: You can choose to sharpen images in
the Camera Raw window or in Elements. Try to avoid sharpening
here and use the sharpening tools in Elements, as we explain in Book
VIII, Chapter 1.
• Noise Reduction: Includes options for adjusting the luminance and
color. You’ve probably seen images with a lot of noise. In extreme
cases, they look like the pictures were printed on sandpaper. Noise
in an image is okay if that’s an effect you intentionally apply to a pic-
ture. However, if you want a smooth-looking image, you have to elim-
inate any noise introduced by the camera. Luminance Smoothing
reduces grayscale noise. The next setting is Color Noise Reduction,
which is used to reduce color noise.
 White Balance: White Balance settings (available in the Basic tab — the
far-left icon below the histogram, as shown in Figure 3-1) are used to
adjust the color balance of an image to reflect the lighting conditions
under which the shot was originally taken. Remember that the sensor in
a digital camera is capable of capturing the entire range of white bal-
ance the sensor can see. You make a choice about settings not necessar-
ily based on what you see, but rather for the white balance of the shot
you took. Therefore, if you set up your camera to take pictures under
one set of lighting conditions and then move to another set of lighting
conditions but forget to change the settings, you can let the Camera
Raw plug-in make a correction for the white balance because the sensor
picked up the entire range, and the necessary data is contained in the
file.
In Figure 3-4, you can see a picture taken with the camera set for tung-
sten lighting, but the shot was taken outdoors in daylight. By changing
the White Balance in the Camera Raw dialog box, you can see how dif-
ferent settings affect the image color.
 Temperature: If one of the preset White Balance options doesn’t quite
do the job, you can move the Basic tab’s Temperature slider or edit the
text box to settle on values between one White Balance choice and
another. Use this item to fine-tune the White Balance.
 Tint: Tint is another fine-tuning adjustment affected by White Balance.
This slider and text box (again, found on the Basic tab) are used to cor-
rect any green or magenta tints that might appear in a photo.
 Brightness adjustments: Several adjustment sliders and text boxes in the
Basic tab help you control the image brightness and tonal range. Notice
the Exposure setting. This item lets you correct photos taken at the wrong

exposure. In analog darkrooms, you might ask technicians to push or pull
film during processing, which results in longer and shorter processing
times. Changing exposure times compensates for under- and overexposing
film. A nice advantage of using Camera Raw is that you can change the
exposure for one image and then later open the original raw image and
change to a different exposure value. Analog film can’t be reprocessed; but
with Camera Raw, you can reprocess over and over again.
Other options for the brightness and tonal controls are similar to the
choices you have in the Elements Full Editing mode. For more informa-
tion on these adjustments, see Book VIII, Chapter 2.
 Cancel/Reset: When you open the Camera Raw window, the button you
see by default is Cancel. Press the Alt key, and the button changes to
Reset. If you want to scrub all the settings you made and start over,
press Alt and click Reset.
 Open Image/Open Copy: This single button has two different purposes:
• Open Image: This button is the default. Click Open after you choose
all your settings to process the photo and open it in Elements.
• Open Copy: Press the Alt key, and the button changes to Open Copy.
Click Open Copy to open a copy of the raw image in Elements.
 Done: Clicking Done doesn’t open the image in Full Edit mode. Click Done
after making changes to the settings, and the new settings become the
new defaults for your raw image. You can clear the defaults by opening
the fly-out menu (top-right corner) and selecting Camera Raw Defaults.
 Zoom: In this drop-down menu, located in bottom-right of the Raw
Camera plug-in window, you can choose from several zoom presets. You
can also edit the text box, click the minus (–) button to zoom out, or
click the plus (+) button to zoom in. Using any option zooms the Image
preview.
 Help: Clicking the Help button opens a Help document to assist you in
understanding more about Camera Raw.
 Save Image: Click the Save Image button to open the Save Options
dialog box, where you can rename the image to save a copy and make
choices for saving in Adobe’s DNG format.
 Depth: If your camera is capable of shooting higher bit depths, they’re
listed here. If you want to convert to 8-bit images for printing, you can
select the option from the drop-down menu.
All we can hope to provide in this book is a simple cursory view for using
Camera Raw. Several entire books have been written exclusively covering
the Camera Raw format and how to open files in the Camera Raw plug-in
window. For a more detailed look at using Camera Raw, see Color
Management for Digital Photographers For Dummies, by Ted Padova and
Don Mason (Wiley).

Figure 3-4: Changing White Balance can dramatically change the image color.
Opening Camera Raw Files
Your first step in converting Camera Raw files is to understand the settings
you have in the raw converter. Having a general knowledge of what the set-
tings do gets you started, but there’s nothing like having a little practice
with the settings and view your results.
The idea behind using the raw converter is that you want to get the tonal
range and brightness values set to an optimum before opening the image
in Elements. You’ll find your editing tasks, like making various color and
brightness adjustments, much easier in Elements if you start with an image
that is, at least, somewhere in the ballpark as far as having a good tonal
range.
Take Figure 3-5 as an example. This Camera Raw file was opened in the
Camera Raw dialog box. The image white balance is way off the scale, the
contrast is poor, the saturation is poor, and the photo is in need of a lot of
adjustments to bring it within an acceptable range of color and contrast.

Figure 3-5: A poor-quality photo opened in the raw converter.
The first step to perform is to adjust the white balance. We moved the
Temperature slider to the far left to bring the white balance into a proper
setting. We then made some adjustments for the Exposure, Brightness,
Contrast, Clarity, and Saturation, as shown in Figure 3-6.
Your clue for making proper adjustments is the Histogram. While you move
the sliders, you want to try to get an even tonal range across the Histogram
without clipping the image (showing spikes on either end). Compare the
Histograms in Figure 3-5 to the one shown in Figure 3-6.
More important than the color balance itself is the data you find in the
Histogram about the tonal range. You can make adjustments for brightness
and color after you open the image in Elements.
After we made our adjustments in the raw converter, we clicked Open and the
photo opened in the Image window in Full Edit mode, as shown in Figure 3-7.
From here, all we need are a few adjustments using the Shadow/Highlight
dialog box and the Levels and the Hue/Saturation dialog box. (See Book VIII,
Chapter 3 for using these image-enhancement settings.)

Saving Your Edits
After opening an image in Full Edit mode, choose File➪Save As and save the
file under a new filename. This way you preserve the original raw image,
and you can return to the raw converter, make other adjustments, and open
the file in Elements again to tweak the brightness and color. For the file
format, choose either Photoshop (PSD) or TIFF (*.TIF) to prevent data loss
such what occurs when saving in JPEG format.
When you open a file in the raw con-
verter and you want to return to the
default image that was taken with your
camera, open the fly-out menu on the
far right of the Basic tab and choose
Reset Camera Raw Defaults, as shown
in Figure 3-8. The photo returns to the
image that was originally taken with
your camera.

n order to produce great output, you must understand color and how
Elements treats color. If you want to carry a laptop computer around to
show off your photos, you can basically adjust color for this particular com-
puter. However, sharing photos with other users, printing your pictures, and
hosting photos on Web sites require that you know something about the
way color is displayed on other devices and in photo prints.
There’s a lot to know about managing color, including setting up color work-
spaces, managing color, and working with color profiles. In this chapter,
we talk about these issues and offer some key concepts for
understanding color as it pertains to Photoshop Elements.
Dealing with Foreground and
Background Colors
Foreground and background colors appear in the
Tools panel as large color swatches. What you see
in the two-color swatches represents the current
selected color for a foreground and the currently
selected color for the background.
By default, the foreground color is black and the back-
ground color is white. By making color selections from the
Color Picker (see the upcoming section “Poking around the Color
Picker”) or from the Swatches panel (see “Grabbing color from the
Swatches panel” later in this chapter), you can change the foreground
and/or background colors.

Defining Color
196
Colors appearing in the Foreground Color Swatch can be used to fill type
selections, shapes, and strokes, as well as with all the marking tools. You
can also use the current background color when using the Eraser tool to
change background color.
A couple of keyboard shortcuts are helpful when working with the fore-
ground and background color swatches. Frequently used keyboard short-
cuts that you want to commit to memory include
 D: Press the D key on your keyboard and you return to default black for
the foreground color and default white for the background color.
 X: Press the X key on your keyboard and the foreground background
colors are reversed. You might want to use this keyboard shortcut
when painting black and white areas with one of the marking tools.
You can also click the two arrows adjacent to the top right of the
Foreground Color Swatch to reverse colors, or click the tiny icon adjacent
to the lower right of the Foreground Color Swatch to return to default
colors.
Defining Color
When you want to use a color for the foreground or background other than
the default black and white colors, you make your color assignments using
tools, panels, or dialog boxes.
All the colors available for a given color mode are accessible from the
Swatches panel and the Photoshop Elements Color Picker. The range of
colors shown in an image is also accessible through sampling color with
the Eyedropper tool.
Poking around the Color Picker
The Color Picker provides you with a color spectrum displaying all the
colors available within a given color mode. If you’re in RGB mode, you can
choose from a color panel of more than 16.7 million colors.
To open the Color Picker, click the Foreground Color Swatch in the Tools
panel. The Color Picker pops up in a dialog box as shown in Figure 4-1. The
choices you have for selecting color and the options available to you in this
dialog box include

The Web Safe palette was introduced more than a decade ago to create a
color palette that used common colors between computer systems with 
8-bit video cards. It’s almost nonessential today since almost all computer
systems use 24-bit color.
 Click to Select Closest Web Safe Color: Click this icon and the closest
Web-safe-color value relative to the new color is selected. 
 Current Foreground Color: When you open the Color Picker, the color
appearing in the Foreground Color Swatch in the Tools panel is dis-
played here. The Current Foreground Color Swatch and the New Color
Choice Swatch show you a before/after difference between the previous
color and the new color.
 HSB values: This measure relates to Hue, Saturation, and Brightness.
These values are the RGB equivalents for HSB.
 RGB values: The numeric values for Red, Green, and Blue. As you
choose other colors in the large color swatch or by sliding the color
spectrum slider, these values and the HSB values change to reflect new
color choices.
 Only Web Colors: Check this box if you want to view only Web-safe
colors.
 Color Spectrum Slider: Move the slider up or down to change the hue
and display a new hue range in the large color swatch.
 Web Safe Hexadecimal Values: Web-safe colors are defined using hexa-
decimal values. The hex value is displayed here for the current new
color.
To define a new foreground color, do the following:
1. Click the Foreground Color Swatch in the Tools panel.
The Color Picker opens.
2. Move the color spectrum slider to the hue range you want to use for
the new color. 
For example, if you want to select a blue color, move the slider up to the
range of blues.
3. Click the cursor in the large Color Swatch to select a color.
The new selected color appears as a circle in the New Color area above
the current foreground color, as shown in Figure 4-2.

4. Click OK.
The new foreground color selected in the Color Picker appears in the
Foreground Color Swatch.
Figure 4-2: A new color selected in the Color Picker.
If you want to change the background color, click the Background Color
Swatch in the Tools panel, and the same Color Picker opens as shown in
Figure 4-1. Any changes you make in the Color Picker are applied to the
background color.
Grabbing color from the Swatches panel
Selecting color in the Color Picker is fine when you want to make a single
color selection and use it once. However, if you want to create your own
custom color panel and reuse colors, you want an easier method for choos-
ing foreground and background colors as well as the ability to reuse the
same colors easily.
The Color Swatches panel provides you with exactly what you need to create
a personal color panel and easily access colors when painting on a canvas or
filling selections on an image.

To open the Color Swatches panel,
choose Window➪Color Swatches. The
Color Swatches panel, shown in Figure
4-3, opens as a floating panel.
When you open the Color Swatches
panel, you see a default panel of
colors. Elements provides you with a
number of different color panels that
you can load into the Color Swatches
panel. This enables you to create your
own custom color panel. 
Using preset color panels
Open the Default drop-down list in the
Color Swatches panel, and you find sev-
eral preset color panels you can load in

Creating a custom swatch set
The Color Picker has all the colors you can use in a given color mode. You
may want to add more colors to one of the color swatch sets when you
select different colors in the Color Picker. You might also want to delete
some colors from a swatch set, or you may want to save your new swatch
set as a library that you can load in Elements so you can use the new
custom colors.
All of this is possible in Elements, and here’s how you go about creating
your own custom color swatches panel:
1. Open the Color Swatches panel.
Choose Window➪Color Swatches to open the panel.
2. Delete colors from the Default panel.
Choose a color you don’t want to appear in your custom color panel.
Press the Alt key and the cursor changes to a Scissors icon. Click a color
swatch with the Alt key depressed to delete the color. Continue deleting
all the colors you don’t want in your custom color set.
3. Select a new color to add to your custom color set.
Click the Foreground Color Swatch in the Tools panel. When the Color
Picker opens, click a color you want to add to your new set. Click OK
and the new color appears as the foreground color.
4. Add the foreground color to the set.
Click More in the Color Swatches panel to open a fly-out menu. From the
menu choices, choose New Swatch. The Color Swatch Name dialog box
opens, as shown in Figure 4-5. The color is derived from the current
foreground color to the left of the Name text box. Type a name for
the color swatch and click OK. The new swatch is added to the Color
Swatches panel.
Figure 4-5: Type a name and click OK to add a color to your Color Swatches panel.

5. Add additional colors.
Continue using Steps 3 and 4 to add new colors to the Swatches panel.
6. Save the swatches.
Open the More fly-out menu and choose Save Swatches. A Save dialog
box opens with the Color Swatches folder selected as the target folder.
Be sure to not change the folder location. Type a name for your new
swatches and click OK.
You have saved a swatches set without disturbing the original Default set.
You can always return to the Default set by selecting another preset from
the drop-down list and then going back to the menu and choosing Default.
The original set remains intact.
Loading swatches
If you created a custom color swatches set and then chose one of the pre-
sets from the Default drop-down list, the custom colors you created are not
visible in the Color Swatches panel. You need to load the swatches back
into the Color Swatches panel in order to use them.
To load swatches, open the More fly-out menu and choose Load Swatches.
A Load dialog box appears with the target folder pointing to the Elements
Color Swatches folder. Here you find all the custom color swatches you
saved from the Color Swatches panel. Select a file in the Load dialog box
and click Open. The custom colors swatches set opens in the Color
Swatches panel.
Replacing swatches
If you want to replace colors in an existing Color Swatches panel, you can
do so by selecting another menu command in the More fly-out menu.
Choose Replace Swatches in this menu and the Load dialog box opens.
Select a file in the Custom Colors folder, and the colors in the file you select
replace the existing swatches.
Lifting and sampling color
If you have a photo that has colors you want to add to your Color Swatches,
you can sample colors in an open image.
Click the Eyedropper tool and click anywhere on a photo in the Image
window and the Eyedropper samples the color. We call this lifting color,
although the color is not removed from the photo, it merely replaces the
current foreground color. If you want to replace the background color, press
the Alt key and click the Eyedropper tool on a color you want to sample.

Understanding Color Management Essentials
203
In the Options bar, you find a few set-
tings for the Eyedropper tool. Click the
Eyedropper tool in the Tools panel and
click the down-pointing arrow adjacent
to Point Sample, and the drop-down
list displays three menu choices, as
shown in Figure 4-6. The menu items
include
 Point Sample: This selection is
the default. When you click the
Eyedropper tool to sample color, the pixel you click is the sampled color.
 3 by 3 Average: This menu choice averages 3 pixels by 3 pixels, and the
sampled color is the result of the sample point and 8 surrounding
colors.
 5 by 5 Average: This menu choice averages 5 pixels by 5 pixels, and the
sampled color is the result of the sample point and 24 surrounding
colors.
Just as you add colors from the Foreground Color Swatch to a Color
Swatches library, you can sample colors in a photo and use the sampled
colors to create a custom Color Swatch library.
Understanding Color Management Essentials
In Elements, when it comes to color, the challenge isn’t understanding color
theory or definitions, but rather matching the RGB color you see on your
computer monitor as closely as possible to your output. Output can be a
printout from a color printer, a screen view on a Web page, or an image in a
photo slide presentation.
We say match “as closely as possible” because you can’t expect to achieve an
exact match. You have far too many printer and monitor variables to deal
with. However, if you properly manage color, you can get a very close match.
To match color in your monitor and your output, you must calibrate your
monitor and then choose a color workspace profile. In the following sec-
tions, you can find all the details on how to do just that.
Introducing color channels
Your first level of understanding color is to understand what RGB is and
how it comes about. RGB stands for red, green, and blue. These are the pri-
mary colors in the computer world. Forget about what you know about
primary colors in an analog world; computers see primary colors as RGB.
Book III
Chapter 4

Managing Color

open the Sample Size drop-down list.

Understanding Color Management Essentials
204
RGB color is divided into color channels. Although you can’t see the individ-
ual channels in Elements, you still need to understand just a little about
color channels.
When you see a color pixel (a tiny, square dot), the color is represented as
different levels of gray in each channel. This may sound confusing at first,
but stay with us for just a minute. When you have a color channel, such as
the red channel, and you let all light pass through the channel, you end up
with a bright red. If you screen that light a little with a gray filter, you let less
light pass through, thereby diluting the red color. This is how channels
work. Individually, they all use different levels of gray that permit up to 256
levels of light to pass through them. When you change the intensity of light
in the different channels, you ultimately change the color.
Each channel can have up to 256 levels of gray that mask out light. The total
number of possibilities for creating color in an RGB model is achieved by
multiplying the values for each channel (256 × 256 × 256). The result is more
than 16.7 million; that’s the total number of colors a computer monitor can
display in RGB color.
This is all well and good as far as theory goes, but what does that mean
practically? Actually, you see some of this information in tools and dialog
boxes you work with in Elements. As an experiment, open a file in Elements
and choose Enhance➪Adjust Lighting➪Levels; the dialog box shown in
Figure 4-7 opens.
Notice that the Channel drop-down menu shows you Red, Green, and Blue
as individual channels, as well as a composite RGB selection. Furthermore,
the Output Levels area shows you values ranging from 0 on the left to 255
on the right. Considering that 0 is a number, you have a total of 256 different
levels of gray.
What’s important is that you know that your work in color is related to
RGB images that comprise three different channels. There are 256 levels
of gray that can let through or hold back light and change brightness values
and color.
Understanding bit depth
Another important item to understand about channels is bit depth. A bit
holds one of two values; one value is for black, the other for white. When you
have 256 levels of gray, you’re working with an 8-bit-per-channel image —
8 bits with 2 possible values each is 28, or 256, possible levels of gray.
Multiply 8 bits per channel times your 3 channels and you get 24 bits, which
is the common bit depth of images you print on your desktop printer.

Understanding Color Management Essentials
205
Figure 4-7: Choose Enhance➪Adjust Lighting➪Levels to open the Levels dialog box.
Now, take a look at the Image➪Mode menu. You should see a menu selection
that says 8 Bits/Channel, as shown in Figure 4-8. When you open an image in
Elements, if this menu command is grayed out, you’re working with a 24-bit
image, or an image of 8 bits per channel.
What does it mean when you can select the 8 Bits/Channel menu command?
You can be certain that your image isn’t an 8-bit-per-channel image. You may
be able to select this command because some digital cameras and most low-
end, consumer-grade scanners can capture images at higher bit depths. You
can scan a photo on a scanner at 16 bits per channel. When you do, you end
up with many more levels of gray. When you take a picture with a quality
digital camera, you can capture 32-bit-per-channel images, and you end up
with a file containing 32,768 levels of gray. That’s a lot!
Now, here’s the catch. All files need to be reduced to 8 bits per channel before
you print them because that’s all the information any printer uses. In addition,
many tools, commands, and panel options work only with 8-bit-per-channel
images. So, you ask, “What’s the benefit of acquiring images at higher bit
depths than I can print them?”
Book III
Chapter 4
Using and
Managing Color

Understanding Color Management Essentials
206
Figure 4-8: When you can choose 8 Bits/Channel, your 
image bit depth is higher than 8 bits per channel.
If you attempt to adjust brightness, contrast, or other image enhancements
in an 8-bit-per-channel image, you often destroy some data. You can cause
some noticeable image degradation if you move adjustment sliders too far
while working with 8-bit-per-channel images. When you edit your 16-bit and
32-bit images, you don’t destroy data — you simply inform Elements which
256 of the total available levels of gray you want to use. The result is an
image with more continuous gray tones than you can achieve in 8-bit-per-

Calibrating your monitor
Your monitor needs to be calibrated to adjust the gamma and brightness,
correct any color tints or colorcasts, and generally get your monitor to dis-
play, as precisely as possible, accurate colors on your output. You have a
few choices for which tool you can use to adjust monitor brightness, rang-
ing from a low-cost hardware device that sells for less than $100 to expen-
sive calibration equipment of $3,000 or more — or you can skip the
hardware and use tools provided by Adobe or Windows.
Gamma is the brightness of midlevel tones in an image. In technical terms,
it’s a parameter that describes the shape of the transfer function for one or
more stages in an imaging pipeline.

Establishing Your Color Settings
207
We skip the high-end costly devices and software utilities that don’t do you
any good and suggest that you make, at the very least, one valuable pur-
chase for creating a monitor profile: a hardware profiling system. On the low
end, some affordable devices go a long way in helping you adjust your moni-
tor brightness and color balance:
 ColorVision Spyder2express: For as low as $64, you can purchase an
easy-to-use, three-step calibration device to balance the color on your
monitor and adjust it for optimum brightness. This device is receiving
five-star ratings at online resellers, including www.amazon.com.
 Pantone Huey Monitor Color Correction: This is another, low-cost
system used for calibrating both CRTs and LCDs. This unit retails for
$89 and sells for $63 at Amazon.com, as of this writing.
 X-Rite Eye-One Display 2 (formerly GreTag MacBeth Eye-One Display
2): This device, like the Spyder2express and Huey, is an easy-to-use pro-
filing tool that works with CRT displays, LCDs, and laptop computers. It
sells for around $195 to $250. You attach the suction cup to your moni-
tor and click a few buttons in the software application accompanying
the hardware, and Eye-One Display 2 eventually prompts you to save a
monitor profile. The profile you create is used automatically by your
operating system when you start your computer. When the profile kicks
in, your monitor is balanced with the settings that were determined
when the device performed the calibration.
On LCD monitors, you adjust some of the hardware controls to bring your
monitor into a match for overall brightness with your photo prints. Be cer-
tain to run many test prints and match your prints against your monitor
view to make the two as similar as possible.
You have a lot to focus on to calibrate monitors and get color right on your
monitor and your output. We talk more about color output in Book IX,
Chapter 3. For a good resource for color correction and printing using
Photoshop Elements, we recommend that you look at Color Management For
Digital Photographers For Dummies, by Ted Padova and Don Mason (Wiley).
Establishing Your Color Settings
After you get your monitor color adjusted by using a hardware profiling
system, your next step is to choose your color workspace. In Elements, you
have a choice between one of two workspace colors: either sRGB or Adobe
RGB (1998). You access your color workspace settings by choosing Edit➪Color
Settings. The Color Settings dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 4-9.
Book III
Chapter 4
Using and
Managing Color

Establishing Your Color Settings
208
The options you have in the Color Settings dialog box include
 No Color Management: This choice turns off all color management.
Don’t choose this option for any work you do in Elements. You use No
Color Management when you work with files that have color profiles
embedded in the photos. Most likely you won’t be using these types of
photos. For information related to when you might use the option, see
Book IX, Chapter 2.
 Always Optimize Colors for Computer Screens: Checking this radio
button sets your workspace to sRGB. sRGB color is used quite often for
viewing images on your monitor. But this workspace often results in the
best choice for color printing, too. Many color printers can output all
the colors you can see in the sRGB workspace. In addition, many photo
services, such as the Kodak EasyShare services (discussed in Book IX,
Chapter 4), prefer this workspace setting.
 Always Optimize for Printing: Checking this option sets your color
workspace to Adobe RGB (1998). This workspace has more available
colors than can be seen on your monitor. If you choose this workspace,
you need to be certain that your printer is capable of using all the
colors in this color space.
 Allow Me to Choose: When you choose this option, Elements prompts
you for a profile assignment when you open images that contain no pro-
file. This setting is handy if you switch back and forth between screen
and print images.
Figure 4-9: The Color Settings dialog box.

Understanding How Profiles Work
209
Understanding How Profiles Work
You probably created a monitor color profile when you calibrated your mon-
itor. You probably also selected a color profile when you opened the Color
Settings dialog box and selected your workspace color. When you start your
computer, your monitor color profile kicks in and adjusts your overall moni-
tor brightness and correction for any colorcasts. When you open a photo in
Elements, color is automatically converted from your monitor color space
to your workspace color.
At print time, you use another color profile to output your photos to your
desktop color printer. Color is then converted from your workspace color to
your printer’s color space. In Book IX, Chapter 2, we show you how to use
color profiles for printing. For now, just realize that the proper use of color
profiles determines whether you can get good color output. From here, you
can jump to Book IX, Chapter 2 and understand how the color profiles are
used at print time.

Undoing in Elements
In This Chapter
 Understanding undoing in Elements
 Returning to unedited files
 Using the Undo History panel
B
ack in 1984, Apple Computer brought windowing interfaces to the
masses with the introduction of the Macintosh computer. Also tucked
into that interface was the Undo command. Both innovations revolutionized
the way people work on a microcomputer. Together with the Cut, Copy,
and Paste commands, these features became a standard in all programs
that followed.
The fact that we can Undo our last edit in a program like Elements gives us
the freedom to experiment, as well as the chance to immediately correct
mistakes. Adobe has taken that initial Undo feature introduced by Apple
Computer and broadened it in Photoshop Elements so you can retrace an
entire series of editing steps with multiple undos, see a visual list of edits
in the Undo History panel, and work with different editing states.
In this chapter, we explore the many options you have to
branch out, experiment a little, and retrace your edit-
ing steps or overcome a series of editing mistakes
without having to save multiple versions of your
photos.
Undoing What’s Done with 
the Undo Command
As you might suspect, the Undo command is found in
the Edit menu. To undo an editing step, you simply
choose Edit➪Undo or press the Ctrl/Ô+Z keys on your key-
board. This simple command helps you correct a mistake or toss
away an experimental edit that doesn’t work for you.

Undoing What’s Done with the Undo Command
212
When you open the Edit menu, you find the Undo command at the top of
the menu. In addition, you find the name of the edit you last applied to the
image. In Figure 5-1, you can see that we just applied a fill within a selection.
When we opened the Edit menu, the menu command appears as Undo Fill.
Figure 5-1: The Undo command appears listed in the Edit menu 
with the name of the last edit applied to the document.
Adjusting the number of available undos
If you make several edits in Elements, you can take advantage of the Undo
command several times. The number of undos you have available is deter-
mined in the Full Edit Preferences dialog box. To adjust the number of undos
you want available, choose Edit➪Preferences (Windows) or Elements➪
Preferences (Macintosh) and the Preferences dialog box opens as shown
in Figure 5-2. Alternatively, you can press Ctrl/Ô+K to open the Preferences
dialog box.
Figure 5-2: The Preferences dialog box.
In the Preferences dialog box, you click the Performance item in the list on
the left to open the Performance preferences panel. Below the History &
Cache item on the right, you find History States, as shown in Figure 5-3.

Reverting to What’s Saved
213
The setting you make here — by adjusting the slider or by typing a number
in the History States text box — determines the number of undos you have
available when you choose Edit➪Undo or press Ctrl/Ô+Z. By default, the
number is set to 50, meaning you can step back to undo edits up to 50 times.
Figure 5-3: The History States number determines the total undos 
you have when editing a file.
The adjustment for History States also relates to the Undo History panel we
talk about later in this chapter in the section, “Working with the Almighty
Undo History Panel.”
Redoing edits
Notice in Figure 5-1 you also have a command for Redo in the Edit menu. If
you choose Undo from the Edit menu or press Ctrl/Ô+Z and then change
your mind, you can always just redo that last undo. Choose Redo or press
Ctrl/Ô+Y and the last undo returns to the state before you chose to undo
the edit. The number of redos you have are the same as the number of
undos. For example, if you set the History States to ten in the Performance
preferences and make ten edits, and then successively press Ctrl/Ô+Z ten
times, you can successively press Ctrl/Ô+Y to redo all the undos.
Reverting to What’s Saved
At times, rather than undo a bunch of edits, you just want to toss all the
edits away and return to the last saved version of your file. The Revert com-
mand in the Edit menu returns you to the last saved version of your photo.
Book III
Chapter 5

Working with the Almighty Undo History Panel
214
If you make several edits and you like what you see, you can choose
File➪Save or press Ctrl/Ô+S to save your edits. If you then make several
more edits and you don’t like the results, choose Edit➪Revert to revert to
the last save.
In many Adobe programs, you find a Revert command listed under the File
menu. In Photoshop Elements, the Revert command is listed under the Edit
menu. Try to keep this in mind when you perform edits in Full Edit mode.
Working with the Almighty Undo History Panel
Using menu commands and keyboard shortcuts enables you to travel back
and forward in time to undo and redo edits. When executing these actions,
you don’t have a visual for what edit will be undone or redone. You need to
choose a menu command or keyboard shortcut and then view the result in
the Image window.
The Undo History panel, on the other hand, displays a visual of your editing
history where you can travel back and forward in time to change your edits
with a complete list of the edits made on a photo shown in the panel.
To open the Undo History panel, choose Window➪Undo History. The Undo
History panel opens as a floating panel. As you make edits on an image,
each edit is shown in a list in the panel as you can see in Figure 5-4.
Figure 5-4: The Undo History panel.
Viewing an image’s various states
What the Undo History panel gives you that menu commands don’t is the
ability to target an Undo (or Redo) back (or forward) to a specific edit. For

Working with the Almighty Undo History Panel
215
example, if you create a selection, apply an enhancement edit (such as
changing image brightness), and then apply a filter, you can return to the
selection with one mouse click. Instead of choosing Undo to undo the filter
and Undo again to undo the image brightness, you simply click the selection
edit in the Undo History panel.
The number of history states is determined in the Performance preferences
shown earlier in Figure 5-3. By default, you have 50 history states that appear
in the Undo History panel. When you come to the 51st edit, the first edit is
deleted from the panel and you cannot return to that state. As additional new
edits are made, you continually delete edits from the top of the panel. 
If you want to add more states to the Undo History panel, open the
Performance preferences and change the value in the History States text box.
As you increase history states in the Performance preferences, the amount
of memory required by Elements is increased. You may find the program
getting sluggish if you double the History States or add more than twice the
default value.
Navigating through the history states
To return to an earlier edit in the Undo History panel, click the item you
want to return to in the list. You might have a number of edits to create a
selection and, after the selection is created, you may apply another series
of edits to the selected area. If you want to return to the selection edit, click
the item in the Undo History panel, as shown in Figure 5-5. 
As long as the items remain in the list, you can click backward or forward to
undo and redo edits.
Deleting and clearing states
You may have a series of edits applied to a document and wish to return to
an earlier edit. All edits made after the item you want to return to are no
longer needed. This might happen if you are experimenting with different
edits and viewing the results. If you know that the items following a particu-
lar edit are no longer needed, you can delete these items from the list.
To delete the last item in the Undo History panel, click the item in the list
and right-click to open a context menu. From the menu choices, select
Delete. The item is deleted from the list.
If you have a series of items you want to delete from the list, click the first
item within a given list of edits to open a context menu. Choose Delete and
all items in the list following the selected item are deleted from the list.

Figure 5-5: Click the item in the list that you want to return to 
so you can undo a series of edits.
You must remember that all edits following an edit you target for deletion
are deleted when you open a context menu and choose Delete. If you want
to delete a series of edits that are followed by edits you want to retain, you
need to individually delete the edits you don’t want. Elements makes no
provision for selecting multiple items in the list where you can select a
group and delete the items together in the group.
If you apply a number of edits and choose File➪Save, the edits made up to
the time you save the file are recorded in the new saved file. The Undo
History panel maintains the list of edits applied to the document before you
last saved it. If you want to clear the Undo History panel, open a context
menu and choose Clear History. The list is cleared and appears the same as
when you first opened the file before you applied any edits.

Selections

A
fter you get beyond understanding color and
ﬁle attributes, one of the most important
editing tasks you can master is creating selec-
tions. As a matter of fact, we make the claim that
when you do, you master Photoshop Elements.
This book takes you through all the various tools
and methods for making selections. Be sure to get
a handle on the concepts contained in this book
before you tackle some of those major editing jobs.

Chapter 1: Making Selections
In This Chapter

S
ometimes you get lucky, and what you capture in the camera’s
viewfinder is exactly what you want to edit, print, or share online. But
at other times, you may want to work with just a portion of that image.
Maybe you just need to adjust the contrast in a certain area. Or you want
to combine part of one image with another. In these instances, you have to
make a selection before you can go on to do the real editing work. 
Being able to make accurate selections is a valuable skill. Fortunately,
Elements offers an assortment of tools and techniques for making selec-
tions. In this chapter, we give you the foundation to use the basic
selection tools. If, after you make a selection, you want to
modify or transform that selection, check out Chapter 2 of
this book. Finally, masking is yet another way to make a
selection. Be sure to look at Book VI, Chapter 4, for the
lowdown on masking. 
Defining Selections
Defining a selection means that you specify which
part of the image you want to work with. Everything
within a selection is considered selected. Everything
outside the selection is unselected. Seems simple
enough. It is, except that you can also have partially
selected pixels, which allow for soft-edged, diffused selec-
tions. You can create partially selected pixels by feathering,
masking, or anti-aliasing the selection. We cover feathering and
anti-aliasing in this chapter. Masking is covered in Book VI, Chapter 4.

Selecting a Rectangular or Elliptical Area
220
When you make a selection, a moving dotted outline called a selection
border (also called a selection outline or selection marquee) appears around
the selected area. After you have made a selection, any adjustments or edits
you apply affect only that portion. The unselected areas remain unchanged.
You can also make a selection in one image and then copy and paste it into
another image. If you can’t squeeze in that trip to Europe this year, no wor-
ries. Select yourself from a family photo, choose Edit➪Copy, open a stock
photo of the Eiffel Tower, and then choose Edit➪Paste. Nobody will know
that you never made it to the City of Lights.
When making selections, be sure that you are working in the Editor, in Full
Edit mode, and not in Quick Fix or Guided modes, or in the Organizer (or
Bridge on the Mac). For more on Elements’ various modes, see Book I,
Chapter 1.
Selecting a Rectangular or Elliptical Area
The Marquee tools are the easiest selection tools to use. Basically, if you
can use a mouse without much difficulty, you can become a marqueeing
expert.
The Rectangular Marquee tool creates rectangular or square selections. Use
this tool when you want to grab just a portion of an image and copy and
paste it into a new, blank document or into another image.
Follow these steps to make a selection with the Rectangular Marquee tool:
1. Select the Rectangular Marquee tool from the Tools panel.
The tool looks like a dotted square. You can also use the keyboard
shortcut — press the M key.
2. Click and drag from one corner of the area that you want to select to
the opposite corner.
While you drag, the selection border appears. The border follows the
movement of your mouse cursor (a crosshair or plus sign icon). 
3. Release your mouse button.
You now have a rectangular selection, as shown in Figure 1-1.
The Elliptical Marquee tool, which shares the same fly-out menu as the
Rectangular Marquee tool, creates elliptical or circular selections. You can
select clocks, doughnuts, inner tubes, and other circular objects with this
tool.

Figure 1-1: The Rectangular Marquee selects part of your image.
Here are the steps to create an elliptical selection:
1. Select the Elliptical Marquee tool from the Tools panel.
You can also use the keyboard shortcut. If the Elliptical Marquee tool
is visible, press the M key. If the Rectangular Marquee is visible, press
Shift+M.
2. Position the crosshair near the area that you want to select, click the
area, and then click and drag around the element.
While you drag, the selection marquee appears.
3. When you’re satisfied with your selection, release the mouse button.
Your elliptical selection is complete, as shown in Figure 1-2.

If your selection isn’t quite centered around your element, move the selec-
tion border by clicking and dragging inside the border with either the
Rectangular or Elliptical Marquee tool. You can also actually move a selec-
tion with either tool while you’re drawing by pressing the spacebar.

Fine-tuning squares and circles
If you want to create a perfect square or circle, hold down the Shift key after
you begin dragging your mouse. When you have your desired selection,
release the mouse button first and then release the Shift key.
You may find it easier to create an elliptical selection by dragging from the
center outward. To do so, click and hold down the mouse button in the
center of your desired element. Then press the Alt key (Option on the Mac)

and drag from the center outward. After you have your desired selection,
release the mouse button first and then the key. 
If you want to draw from the center out and want a perfect circle (or square),
hold down the Shift key as well. When you have your desired selection,
release your mouse button first and then Shift+Alt (Shift+Option on the Mac). 
Using the Marquee options
The Options bar provides oodles of other options when you are making
Marquee selections. Some of these options allow you to make precise selec-
tions by specifying exact measurements. Others enable you to make soft-
edged, feathered selections.
You must select the options on the Options bar, shown in Figure 1-3, before
you make your selection with the Marquee tools. The only exception is
that you can feather a selection after you have created it.
Figure 1-3: Specify Marquee settings in the Options bar.
Here’s the scoop on each of the Marquee options:
 Feather: Feathering softens, or feathers, the edges of a selection. The
amount of softening depends on the value — the higher the value, the
softer the edge, as shown in Figure 1-4. The radius measures how far
in all directions the feather effect extends. Small amounts of feathering
can be used to create natural transitions between selected elements in
a collage. Larger amounts are used to create a special effect where one
image gradually fades into another. If you just want a selected element
to have a soft edge without the background, choose Select➪Inverse and
then delete the background. 
To feather while you’re selecting, select the Feather option on the
Options bar before you use the Marquee tools. You can feather a selec-
tion after the fact by using the Select➪Feather submenu.

Figure 1-4: Feathering a selection softens the edges.
 Anti-alias: Whereas feathering completely softens edges, anti-aliasing
just slightly softens the edge of an elliptical or irregularly shaped selec-
tion so that very hard, jagged edges aren’t quite so prominent, as
shown in Figure 1-5. An anti-aliased edge is always only 1 pixel wide.
We recommend keeping the Anti-Alias option selected, especially if
you plan on creating collaged images. Anti-aliasing helps create natural-
looking transitions and blends between multiple selections. However, if
you want a super-crisp edge, uncheck this option.
 Mode: The Mode drop-down list contains three settings:
• Normal: This option enables you to freely drag a selection to any
dimension.
• Fixed Aspect Ratio: This setting allows you to specify a fixed ratio of
width to height in a selection. For example, if you enter 2 for width
and 1 for height, you always get a Marquee selection that’s twice as
wide as it is high, no matter what the size.
• Fixed Size: This setting lets you specify values for the Width and
Height. This option comes in handy when you need to make multiple
selections that must be the same exact size, such as in a school year-
book. Note that the marquee is immediately drawn when you click
your canvas. The click point is the top-left corner of the marquee.

 Width and Height: When you select Fixed Aspect Ratio or Fixed Size
from the drop-down list, you also enter values in the Width and Height
text boxes. To swap the Width and Height values, click the double-
headed arrow button.
Even though the default unit of measurement in the Width and Height
text boxes is pixels (px), you can enter any unit of measurement that
Element recognizes — pixels, inches (in), centimeters (cm), millimeters
(mm), points (pt), picas (pica), or percents (%). Enter the value and then
type the word or abbreviation of your desired unit of measurement. 
Freeform Selecting with the Lasso Tools 
Unfortunately, not much in life is perfectly rectangular or elliptical in shape.
Most of the time, you have to deal with irregular shapes that have undula-
tions of some kind or another. That’s where the Lasso tools come in handy.
This group of tools enables you to make any freeform selection your heart
desires.
Elements offers three Lasso tools: the Lasso tool, the Polygonal Lasso tool,
and the Magnetic Lasso tool. Each Lasso tool has its own special purpose
in the world of freeform selections, and they’re simple to use. You just have
to drag around the part of the image that you want to select. All that is
required is a decaffeinated, steady hand.

The selection you make is only as good as how accurately you can trace
around your desired element. If you don’t make an exact selection the first
time around, don’t worry. You can always go back and make corrections, as
described in Book III, Chapter 5.
If, when making a selection, you find the mouse a little unwieldy, you may
want to look into a digital drawing tablet, such as a Wacom tablet. Using 
a tablet makes using the Lasso tool — as well as other tools, like the 
Brush — much easier. Tablet lovers claim you’ll never revisit mouse 
usage again.
The Lasso and Polygonal Lasso tools have three settings on the Options
bar — Feather, Anti-Alias, and Refine Edge. These options work exactly as
they do with the Marquee tools. To find out about Feather and Anti-Alias,
see the earlier section, “Using the Marquee options.” The Refine Edge
option (brush button) does exactly that — cleans up the edges of your
selection. You also find this command in the Options bar for the Magic
Wand and Quick Selection tools. Keep in mind that you can apply this
option to any existing selection, no matter how you got that selection, 
by choosing Select➪Refine Edge. 
Here’s the scoop on the settings for the Refine Edge option:
 Smooth: Smoothes out the jaggedness along the selection edge.
 Feather: Softens the edges of a selection. Move the slider to increas-
ingly create a softer, more blurred edge.
 Contract/Expand: Decreases or increases your selected area.
 Standard or Overlay mode: Enables you to preview your selection 
in one of two modes. Click the Custom Overlay Color icon to preview
your selection with your edges hidden and a semi-opaque layer of color
(that shows onscreen only) in your unselected area. Double-click the
icon to change the color and opacity of the overlay. Press F to cycle
between Standard and Overlay views. Press X to hide your selection
edges.
 Zoom tool: Enables you to zoom into your image to see the effects of
your settings.
 Hand tool: Lets you pan around your document window to see the
effects of your settings on various portions of your image.

Freeform Selecting with the Lasso Tools

Using the Lasso tool
Making a selection with the Lasso tool is basically like tracing an outline
around an element on a sheet of paper. 
To make a selection by using the Lasso tool, follow these steps:
1. Select the Lasso tool from the
Tools panel.
It’s the tool that looks like a rope,
hence the moniker “lasso.” You can
also use the keyboard shortcut by
pressing the L key. If the Lasso
isn’t visible, press Shift+L to cycle
through the various Lasso tools.
2. Position the cursor anywhere
along the edge of the element you
want to select.
The hot spot (the leading point) of
the Lasso cursor is the end of the
rope. If you need a little visual
help, press the Caps Lock key,
which switches your cursor to a
crosshair.
Zoom in on the image a bit if you
need to better see your edges.
In our example, we started at the
bottom of the butterfly wing, as
shown in Figure 1-6.
3. Hold down the mouse button and
trace around the element, trying
to include only what you want to
select.
While you trace, an outline forms
that follows the movement of your
mouse.

Don’t release the mouse button
until you complete the selection
by closing the loop and returning
to your starting point. When 
you release the mouse button,
Elements assumes you’re done 
and closes the selection from
wherever you release the 
mouse button to your starting
point.
4. Continue tracing until you return
to your starting point; release the
mouse button.
Elements rewards you with a 
selection border that matches
your Lasso line, as shown in 
Figure 1-7.
Selecting straight sides
with the Polygonal 
Lasso tool
The Polygonal Lasso tool is at its best
when selecting straight-sided subjects,
such as city skylines, buildings, and
stairways. Unlike the Lasso tool, the
Polygonal Lasso tool has rubber band-
like qualities, and instead of dragging,
you click and release the mouse
button at the corners of the object that
you’re selecting. 
Follow these steps to select with the Polygonal Lasso tool:
1. Select the Polygonal Lasso tool in the Tools panel.
You can also use the keyboard shortcut by pressing the L key. If the
Polygonal Lasso isn’t visible, press Shift+L until you get the tool. It looks
like the Lasso tool, but it has straight sides.

2. Click and release at any point along the edge of the desired 
element. 
We like starting at a corner.
3. Move (don’t drag) the mouse and click and release at the next corner
of the element. Continue clicking and releasing at the various corners
of the object.
The line stretches out from each corner that you click, like a rubber
band.
4. To close a selection, return to your starting point and click and
release.
When you place the cursor over the starting point, a small circle appears
next to the cursor, indicating that you’re at the right place for closing the
selection. A selection marquee that matches your Polygonal Lasso line
appears, as shown in Figure 1-8.
Some objects have both curves and straight sides. No problem. Hold down
the Alt key (Option on the Mac) to have the Polygonal Lasso tool temporar-
ily transform into the regular Lasso tool. Then, click and drag to select the
curves. Release the Alt key (Option) to return to the Polygonal Lasso tool.
This trick also works with the other Lasso tools.
Hugging edges with the Magnetic Lasso tool
The last Lasso tool is the Magnetic Lasso, which works by analyzing the
colors of the pixels between the elements in the foreground and the ele-
ments in the background. Then, it snaps to, or hugs, the edge between the
elements, as if the edge had a magnetic pull.
Not always the easiest tool to manipulate, the Magnetic Lasso tool performs
best when your image has a well-defined foreground object and good con-
trast between that object and the background — for example, a dark moun-
tain range against a light sky or a black silhouette against a white wall.
The Magnetic Lasso tool has some unique settings, found in the Options bar,
which you can adjust to control the sensitivity of the tool and thus aid in
your selection task.

We recommend starting out by experimenting with the Magnetic Lasso tool
using its default settings. If the tool isn’t cooperating, then play with the
options.
The Feather, Anti-Alias, and Refine Edge options work as they do with the
Marquee and Lasso tools. Here are the remaining options:
 Width: This option, measured in pixels from 1 to 256, determines how
close to the edge you have to move the mouse before the Magnetic
Lasso tool snaps to that edge. Decrease the value if the object’s edge
has a lot of indentations and protrusions or if the image has low con-
trast. Increase the value if the image has high contrast or smooth 
edges.

Freeform Selecting with the Lasso Tools
231
 Edge Contrast: Measured in percentages from 1 to 100, this option
specifies the contrast between the object and its background required
before the Magnetic Lasso tool snaps to the edge. If the image has good
contrast between the foreground element and its background, use a
high percentage.
 Frequency: This setting, measured in percentages from 0 to 100, speci-
fies how many fastening points (points anchoring the selection line) to
place on the selection line. The higher the value, the more fastening
points used. If the element you want to select has a fairly smooth edge,
keep the value low. If the edge is jagged or has a lot of detail, try a
higher value to get a more accurate selection.
 Tablet Pressure (Pen icon): If you own a pressure-sensitive drawing
tablet, select this option to make an increase in stylus pressure cause
the edge width to decrease.
Follow these steps to use the Magnetic Lasso tool:
1. Select the Magnetic Lasso tool in the Tools panel.
You can also press the L key if the tool is visible. If it isn’t, press Shift+L
to cycle through the Lasso tools. The tool looks like a straight-sided
lasso with a magnet on it.
2. Click and release on the edge of the element you want to select to
place the first fastening point.
Start anywhere, but be sure to click the edge between the element you
want and the background you don’t want.
3. Move your cursor around the object without clicking.
The Magnetic Lasso tool creates a selection line similar to the other
lasso tools while placing fastening points that anchor down the selec-
tion line. (See Figure 1-9.) Think of it as the way you might cordon off an
area of your yard with ropes and stakes.
Here are a couple of tips to keep in mind when working with the
Magnetic Lasso tool:
• If the Magnetic Lasso tool starts veering off the edge of your object,
back up your mouse and click and release to force a fastening point
farther down on the line.

Chapter 1

• If the Magnetic Lasso tool adds a point where you don’t want one,
simply press your Backspace (Delete on a Mac) key to delete it.
• If the Magnetic Lasso is misbehaving, you can temporarily switch to
the other Lasso tools. To select the Lasso tool, press the Alt key
(Option on the Mac), and then press the mouse button and drag. To
select the Polygonal Lasso tool, press Alt (Option on the Mac) and
click, don’t drag.
4. Continue moving the mouse around the object and then return to
your starting point; click and release the mouse button to close the
selection.
A small circle appears next to your cursor, indicating that you’re at the
correct place to close the selection. The selection border appears when
the selection is closed.

Performing Wand Wizardry
The Magic Wand has been around since the beginning of the digital-imaging
era. You’d think, with a name like Magic Wand, that it would grant your
every selection wish with a mere click. Well, yes and no. The success of the
Magic Wand really depends on your particular image. 
It’s a no-brainer to operate. Click the element you want within your image,
and the Magic Wand makes a selection. This selection is based on the color
of the pixel (the target pixel) directly under the cursor when you click. If
other pixels are similar in color to your target pixel, Elements includes them
in the selection. What’s sometimes hard to predict, however, is how to
determine how similar the color has to be to get the Magic Wand tool to
select it. That’s where the Tolerance setting comes in. First, here’s a little
info on Tolerance so you can better wield the Wand. 
Talking about Tolerance
The Tolerance setting determines the range of color that the Magic Wand
tool selects. The issue is that most images contain a few shades of a similar
color. For example, consider an image of a field of grass. A few shades of
green make up that field. Using the Magic Wand tool, if you click a darker
shade of green, it selects all similar shades of green, but the lighter shades
remain unselected. This is a sign that you need to increase the Tolerance
level to select all the shades of the green grass. Tolerance is based on
brightness levels that range from 0 to 255. That being said
 Setting the Tolerance to 0 selects one color only.
 Setting the Tolerance to 255 selects all colors, or the entire image.
The default setting is 32; so whenever you click a pixel, Elements analyzes
the value of that base color and then selects all pixels whose brightness
levels are between 16 levels lighter and 16 levels darker.
What if an image contains a few shades of the same color? It’s not a huge
problem. You can try different Tolerance settings. Try a higher Tolerance
setting if you didn’t quite pick up what you wanted in the first try, as shown
in Figure 1-10. Conversely, if your wand selects too much, you can also lower
your Tolerance setting. Or you can make multiple clicks of the Magic Wand
to pick up additional pixels that you want to include in the selection.

Selections

Figure 1-10: Finding the right Tolerance is the key to selecting with the Magic Wand.
Selecting with the Magic Wand tool
The Magic Wand tool works best when you have high-contrast images or
images with a limited number of colors. For example, the optimum image
for the Wand would be a solid-colored object on a white background. Skip
the wand if the image has a ton of colors and no real definitive contrast
between your desired element and the background.
1. Select the Magic Wand tool in the Tools panel.
It looks like, well, a wand. You can also press the W key.
2. Click the portion of the image that you want to select, using the
default Tolerance setting of 32.
Tolerance of 32
Tolerance of 64

Performing Wand Wizardry
235
The pixel that you click (the target pixel) determines the base color.
Remember, the default value of 32 means that the Magic Wand tool
selects all colors that are 16 levels lighter and 16 levels darker than the
base color.
If you selected everything you wanted the first time you used the Magic
Wand tool, give yourself a pat on the back. If you didn’t (which is proba-
bly the case), go to Step 3.
3. Enter a new Tolerance setting on the Options bar.
If the Magic Wand tool selected more than you wanted it to, lower the
Tolerance setting. If it didn’t select enough, raise the setting.
Here are a few other options to specify:
• Anti-alias: This option subtly softens the edge of the selection. See
“Using the Marquee options” earlier in this chapter for details.
• Contiguous: When this option is selected, the Magic Wand tool
selects only pixels that are adjacent to each other. When this option
is unselected, the Magic Wand tool selects all pixels within the range
of tolerance, whether or not they’re adjacent to each other.
• All Layers: If you have multiple layers and enable this option, the
Magic Wand selects pixels from all visible layers. If unselected, the
Tool selects pixels from the
active layer only. For more on
layers, see Book VI.
• Refine Edge: This option
enables you to clean up the
selection edges. See the earlier
section “Freeform Selecting
with the Lasso Tools” for
details on this option.
4. Click the portion of the image
that you want to select.
Changing the Tolerance level does-
n’t adjust the current selection, so
you must start again by clicking
your image. The Magic Wand tool
then deselects the current selec-
tion and makes a new selection —
based on the new Tolerance set-
ting, as shown in Figure 1-11. If it
still isn’t right, you can adjust the
Tolerance setting again.
Unfortunately, it’s all about trial
and error.

Saving Time with the Quick Selection Tool
None of us ever have enough time, so any tool that can shave a few minutes
off a selection task is welcome. The Quick Selection tool can do just that.
Think of it as a combo Brush/Magic Wand/Lasso tool. Easy to use — and
producing surprisingly good results — it’s sure to become a favorite part of
your collection of selection tools.
To make short work of selecting by using this tool, follow these steps:
1. Select the Quick Selection tool from the Tools panel.
The tool looks like a wand with a marquee around the end. It shares the
same fly-out menu as the Selection Brush tool. You can also press the A
key — or press Shift+A if the tool isn’t visible.
This is one of the few tools that works in either Full Edit or Quick Fix
mode.
2. Specify the options on the Options bar.
Here’s an explanation of the options:
• New Selection: The default option enables you to create a new
selection. There are also options to add to and subtract from
your selection.
• Brush Picker: Choose your
desired brush settings. Specify
the diameter, from 1 to 2500
pixels. You can also specify
hardness, spacing, angle, and
roundness settings. 
• All Layers: If the image has
layers and you want to make a
selection from all the layers,
select this option. If this option
is left unselected, you can
select only from the active
layer.
• Auto-Enhance: Check this
option to have Elements assist
you with automatically refining
your selection by implement-
ing an algorithm.
3. Click and drag over the desired
areas of the image.
Your selection grows while you
drag, as shown in Figure 1-12.
Digital Vision
Figure 1-12: Paint a selection with the
Quick Selection tool.

237
If you stop dragging and click another portion of the image, your selec-
tion includes that clicked area.
4. Modify your selection, as needed.
You have three options to change your selection:
• To add to your selection, press the Shift key while dragging across
your desired image areas. 
• To delete from your selection, press the Alt key (Option on the Mac)
while dragging across the unwanted image areas.
• You can also select the Add to Selection and Subtract from Selection
options in the Options bar.
5. If you need to further fine-tune your selection, click the Refine Edge
option in the Options bar.
We explain the Refine Edge settings in detail in the “Freeform Selecting
with the Lasso Tools” section, earlier in this chapter. If the object is
fairly detailed, you may even need to break out the Lasso or another
selection tool to make some final clean-ups. 
Painting with the Selection Brush
If the action of painting on a canvas is more up your alley, try out the
Selection Brush. Using two different modes, you can either paint over areas
of an image that you want to select or paint over areas you don’t want to
select. The Selection Brush also lets you make a basic selection with
another tool, such as the Lasso, and then fine-tune the selection by brushing
additional pixels into or out of the selection.
Follow these steps to paint a selection with the Selection Brush:
1. Select the Selection Brush from the Tools panel or simply press the A
key (or Shift+A if the tool isn’t visible).
This tool works in either Full Edit or Quick Fix mode.
2. Specify your Selection Brush options in the Options bar.
Here’s the scoop on each option:
• Brush Presets: Choose a brush from the presets drop-down panel. To
load additional brushes, click the downward-pointing arrow to the left
of Default Brushes and choose the preset library of your choice. You
can select the Load Brushes command from the panel pop-up menu.
• Brush Size: Enter a brush size from 1 to 2500 pixels. You can also
drag the slider.
Book IV
Chapter 1
Making 
Selections

• Mode: Choose between Selection and Mask. Choose Selection to add
to your selection and choose Mask to subtract from your selection.
If you choose Mask mode, you must choose some additional overlay
options. An overlay is a layer of color (that shows onscreen only)
that hovers over your image, indicating protected or unselected
areas. You must also choose an overlay opacity between 1 and 100
percent. You can also choose to change the overlay color from the
default red to another color. This option can be helpful if the image
contains a lot of red.
• Hardness: Set the hardness of the brush tip, from 1 to 100 percent.
3. If your Mode is set to Selection, paint over the areas you want to select.
You see a selection border. Each stroke adds to the selection. If you
inadvertently add something you don’t want, simply press the Alt key
(Option on the Mac) and paint over the undesired area. After you finish
painting what you want, your selection is ready to go.
4. If your mode is set to Mask, paint over the areas that you don’t want
to select.
When you’re done painting your mask, choose Selection from the Mode
drop-down list, or simply choose another tool from the Tools panel in
order to convert your mask into a selection border.
While you paint, you see the color of your overlay. Each stroke adds
more to the overlay area, as shown in Figure 1-13. When working in
Mask mode, you’re essentially covering up, or masking, the areas you
want to protect from manipulation. That manipulation can be selecting,
adjusting color, or performing any other Elements command. Again, if
you want to remove parts of the masked area, press the Alt key (Option
on the Mac) and paint.
If you painted the selection in Mask mode, the selection border is
around what you don’t want. To switch to what you do want, choose
Select➪Inverse.
The Mode you choose is up to you. One advantage to working in Mask
mode is that you can partially select areas. By painting with soft
brushes, you create soft-edged selections. These soft edges result in
partially selected pixels. If you set the overlay opacity to a lower per-
centage, the pixels are even less opaque or “less selected.” If this “par-
tially selected” business sounds vaguely familiar, it’s because this is
also what happens when you feather selections, as we discuss earlier in
this chapter.

or most people, getting the perfect, pristine selection on the first
attempt is pretty difficult. A little too much caffeine or not enough shut
eye, and that once steady hand is no longer so. Fortunately, Elements, being
the compassionate digital-imaging friend that it is, understands this and
doesn’t make you settle for inaccurate selections. You have many ways to
modify and transform selections to refine them to the point of near-perfect
accuracy. You can add or remove pixels from your selection, scale the selec-
tion outline, smooth out jagged edges, or switch what’s selected for
what isn’t. In this chapter, we’ll show you how how to clean
up and modify your selections and enable you to nail the
desired element with precision.
If you haven’t already checked out the first chapter
of Book IV and gotten a good grasp of how to create
selections in the first place, you may want to start
there. 
Modifying Selections
Although the selection tools, such as the Lasso, Quick
Selection, and Magic Wand tools, usually do a fair job of
capturing most of the desired selection, making a really
accurate selection often requires some amount of modification
and cleanup. If you give the selection a little extra TLC, you are

Modifying Selections
242
rewarded with more accuracy and precision. By adding and subtracting
from the selection, you can refine it and ensure that you capture only what
you really want.
With the multitude of tools and features in Elements, there is usually more
than one way to execute the task. In this section, we show you how to use
keyboard operations (along with your mouse) to modify your selections. But
note that you can also use the four selection option buttons on the left side of
the Options bar to create a new selection, add to a selection, subtract from a
selection, or intersect one selection with another. You just choose the selec-
tion tool, click the selection option button you want, and drag (or click and
release, if you’re using the Magic Wand or Polygonal Lasso tool). When you’re
using the Selection Brush, the Add to Selection and Subtract from Selection
buttons are also available. 
When adding to a selection, a small plus sign (+) appears next to your
cursor. When subtracting from a selection, a small minus sign (–) appears.
When intersecting two selections, a small multiplication sign (×) appears.
Adding to a selection
If your selection doesn’t contain all the elements you want to capture, you
need to add those portions to your current selection.
To add to a current selection, simply hold down the Shift key and click and
drag around the pixels you want to include when using the regular Lasso or
the Rectangular or Elliptical Marquee tool. If you’re using the Polygonal
Lasso, click and release around the area. (We wouldn’t use the Magnetic
Lasso tool to add to a selection; it’s way too cumbersome.)
You can also hold down the Shift key and click the area you want when
using the Magic Wand tool, or drag on the area you want when using the
Quick Selection tool. 
Note that after your first drag with the Quick Selection tool, your selection
option button should convert to the Add to Selection button automatically.
When using the Selection Brush on Selection mode, the selection option
button is also set automatically to the Add to Selection button.
You don’t have to use the same tool to add to your selection that you used
to create the original selection. Feel free to use whatever selection tool you
think can get the job done. For example, it’s common to start off with the
Magic Wand and clean up your selection with the Lasso tool. See Book IV,
Chapter 1 if you need more info on selection tools. 

Modifying Selections
243
Follow these steps to add to a circular selection, such as the one shown in
Figure 2-1:
1. Make your first elliptical selec-
tion with the Elliptical Marquee
tool, as shown in the top example
in Figure 2-1.
Be sure you hold down the Alt key
(Option on the Mac) to draw from
the center out. Also, press the
Shift key if you wish to constrain
your selection to a circle.
2. To add to your initial selection,
you hold down two keys at once.
First hold down the Shift key to
add to the selection, and then
hold down the Alt key (Option on
the Mac) to draw from the center
out. You must press and hold
down the keys in this order.
Note that if you also need to con-
strain your selection to a perfect
circle you have a dilemma
because the Shift key is already
being used to add to the selection. See the upcoming section “Avoiding
Keyboard Collisions” for a solution.
3. Drag around the second selection by using the Elliptical Marquee tool.
We had to do Steps 2 and 3 several times because we had to select all
the tennis balls. The resulting selection is shown in the example on the
bottom in Figure 2-1.
Subtracting from a selection
Just as you can add to a selection marquee, you can also subtract from a
selection. Here’s how to subtract from a current selection using the follow-
ing tools: 
 Using the Lasso or the Rectangular or Elliptical Marquee tool: Hold
down the Alt key (Option on the Mac) and drag around the pixels you
want to subtract.
 Using the Magic Wand and Quick Selection tools: Hold down the Alt
key (Option on the Mac) and click the area you want to remove.

In Figure 2-2, we first selected the
frame by using the Polygonal Lasso
tool. We didn’t use the obvious tool of
choice — the Rectangular Marquee
tool — because the frame wasn’t 
completely straight. To deselect 
the inside of the frame from the selec-
tion, we again used the Polygonal
Lasso tool, holding down the Alt 
key (Option on the Mac) and clicking
at each corner of the inside of the
frame to produce the selection 
shown.
Intersecting two selections
What happens when you hold down the Shift and Alt keys (Shift+Option 
on the Mac) together? An intersection, that’s what. Holding down both 
keys while dragging with the Lasso and Marquee tools, clicking and 
releasing with the Polygonal Lasso tool, or clicking with the Magic Wand
tool all create the intersection of the original selection with the second
selection. 
Avoiding Keyboard Collisions
Elements has a little conflict in its methods. With so many ways of doing
things, sometimes you may have to fiddle with Elements to get it to do what
you want. For example, when you press the Shift key, how does Elements
know whether you want to create a perfect square or add to a selection? Or,
what if you want to delete part of a selection while also drawing from the
center outward? Both actions require the use of the Alt key (Option on the
Mac). There is a way out of this keyboard madness.

Adding a perfectly square or circular selection
To add a perfectly square or round selection to an existing selection, follow
these steps:
1. Hold down Shift and drag when using the Rectangular or Elliptical
Marquee tool.
Your selection is unconstrained.
2. While you drag, keeping your mouse button pressed, release the Shift
key for just a moment, and then press and hold it again.
Your unconstrained selection suddenly snaps into a constrained square
or circle.
3. Release the mouse button before you release the Shift key.
If you don’t release the mouse button before you release the Shift key, the
selection shape reverts back to its unconstrained form.
Deleting from an existing selection 
while drawing from the center out
To delete part of a selection while drawing from the center out, follow these
steps:
1. Hold down the Alt key (Option on the Mac) and drag when using the
Rectangular or Elliptical Marquee
tool.
2. While you drag, keeping your
mouse button pressed, release
the Alt key (Option on the Mac)
for just a moment, and then press
and hold it again.
You’re now drawing from the
center outward.
3. Release the mouse button before
you release the Alt key (Option
on the Mac).
Use this technique when you’re 
selecting a doughnut, tire, inflatable
swim ring, or other circular items that
have holes in the middle, as shown in
Figure 2-3.

Using the Select Menu
Although you can add, subtract, and
intersect selections by using the Shift
and Alt keys (Option on the Mac) and
the selection option buttons on the
Options bar, you can do even more with
the commands on the Select menu,
shown in Figure 2-4. In this menu, you
find ways to expand, contract, smooth,
and soften your selection, and even
turn your selection inside out. You can
also use this menu to automatically
select similar colors. If you use the
Select menu, your selections should be
ready and rarin’ for action.
Selecting all or nothing
The Select All and Deselect commands
are pretty self-explanatory. To select
everything in your image, or if your
image has layers, everything in the
chosen layer, choose Select➪All, or
press Ctrl+A (Cmd+A on the Mac). To
deselect everything, choose Select➪Deselect, Ctrl+D (Ô+D on the Mac).
Remember that you rarely have to use Select All. If you don’t have a selec-
tion border in the image, Elements assumes that you want to apply whatever
command you execute to the entire image.
Reselecting a selection
If you’ve taken some valuable time to carefully lasso a spiky iguana from its
perch on a mangrove tree, the last thing you want is to lose your hard-
earned selection border. But that’s what happens if you inadvertently click
the image when you have an active selection border — it disappears.
Yes, technically, you can choose Edit➪Undo if you catch your error right
away. And, you can access the Undo History panel to recover your selec-
tion. But a much easier solution is to choose Select➪Reselect, which
retrieves your last selection.
The Reselect command works for only the last selection you made, so don’t
plan to reselect a selection you made last Wednesday — or even two min-
utes ago — if you’ve selected something else after that selection. If you
want to reuse a selection for the long term, save it, as we explain in the sec-
tion “Saving and loading selections,” later in this chapter.
Figure 2-4: The commands on the Select
menu.

Using the Select Menu
247
Inversing a selection
Sometimes, selecting what you don’t
want is easier than selecting what you
do want. For example, if you’re trying to
select your cat Princess, photographed
against a neutral background, why
spend valuable time meticulously select-
ing her with the Lasso tool, when you
can just click the background with the
Magic Wand tool?
After you select the background, just
choose Select➪Inverse. Voilà, Princess 
is selected and obediently awaiting
your next command, as shown in 
Figure 2-5.
Feathering a selection
In Book IV, Chapter 1, we describe how to feather (soften or blur the edges
of) a selection when using the Lasso and Marquee tools by entering a value
in the Feather option in the Options bar. This method of feathering requires
that you set your Feather radius before you create your selection.
A problem may arise with feathering before you select if later you want to
modify your initial selection. When you make a selection with a feather, the
selection border adjusts to take into account the amount of the feather. So,
the resulting marquee outline doesn’t resemble your precise mouse move-
ment. As a result, modifying, adding, or subtracting from your original selec-
tion is pretty difficult.
A much better way to feather a selection is to make your initial selection
without a feather, as shown in the top image of Figure 2-6. Clean up your
selection as necessary, and then apply your feather by choosing Select➪
Feather. In the dialog box, enter a radius value from .2 to 250 pixels and click
OK. The resulting selection appears in the bottom image of Figure 2-6.
The radius is how far out in all directions the feather extends. A radius of 8
means the feather extends 8 pixels outward from the selection outline. A
large feather radius makes the image appear to fade out.
The Refine Edge command, which appears right after Feather in the Select
menu, enables you to fine-tune your selection edges using various options.
For full details on this option, see the section “Freeform Selecting with the
Lasso Tools” in Book IV, Chapter 1.

Using the Modify commands
The Select➪Modify menu contains a group of modification commands that
are lumped together categorically. You probably won’t use these options
every day, but sometimes they can come in handy. Here’s the lowdown on
each command:
 Border: Selects the area around the edge of the selection. You specify
the width of the area from 1 to 200 pixels, and you get a border outline,
as shown on the left in Figure 2-7. Choose Edit➪Fill Selection and fill the
border with color, as shown in the right image in Figure 2-7.

Figure 2-7: The Border command creates a selection outline, which you can then fill with color.
 Smooth: Rounds off the nooks, crannies, and jagged edges. Enter a
radius value from 1 to 100 pixels, and Elements looks at each selected
pixel and then includes or deselects the pixels based on the radius
value. If most of the pixels are selected, Elements includes the strays;
if most of the pixels are unselected, Elements removes these pixels.
Start with 2 pixels or so — and if that doesn’t seem like enough,
increase it by a few pixels.
Use this command with great caution. It’s just too easy to get mushy,
inaccurate selections.
 Expand: Increases the size of your selection by a specified number of
pixels, from 1 to 100. This command comes in handy if you just miss the
edge of an elliptical selection and want to enlarge it just a tad.
 Contract: Shrinks your selection by 1 to 100 pixels. When you’re com-
positing multiple images, you can benefit by slightly contracting your
selection if you plan on applying a feather. This enables you to avoid
picking up a fringe of background pixels around your selection.
After you make a selection, contract it and then feather it before you drag it
onto the canvas. This technique helps to create a natural-looking transition
between the images in your composite. The amount you decide to contract
and feather varies according to the resolution of the images. For example, if
you’re using low-resolution (72 ppi) images, you may want to use 1 pixel for
the Contract amount and 0.5 pixels for the Feather amount; higher-resolution

images may warrant 2 to 3 pixels for the Contract amount and 1 to 2 pixels
for the Feather amount. If the word resolution makes you scratch your head,
see Book III, Chapter 1.
Applying the Grow and Similar commands
The Grow and Similar commands are often mentioned in the same breath
with the Magic Wand tool. If you didn’t get the perfect selection on the first
click — a very common occurrence, unfortunately — you can use the Grow
command. For example, to include more in your selection, you increase
the Tolerance setting and try again — hold down Shift and click the area to
include. Or you can choose Select➪Grow. The Grow command increases the
size of the selection by including adjacent pixels that fall within the range of
Tolerance.
The Similar command is like Grow, only the pixels don’t have to be adjacent
to be selected. The command searches throughout the image and picks up
pixels within the Tolerance range.
Both commands use the Tolerance value that’s displayed on the Options
bar when you have the Magic Wand tool selected. Adjust the Tolerance set-
ting to include more or fewer colors by increasing or decreasing the setting,
respectively.
Moving and Cloning Selections
When you have your selection modified to perfection, you may then want to
move it or clone it. To move a selection, simply grab the Move tool (the
four-headed arrow) in the Tools panel, and then drag the selection.
Sounds easy enough, right? When you move the selection, however, be
warned that the area where the selection used to reside is now filled with
the background color, as shown in Figure 2-8. It turns out, though, that the
background color only appears if you decide to move both the selection
outline and the image pixels. But you don’t have to move both; you can
move just the selection outline (without the pixels), as we explain in the
section “Moving the selection outline, but not the pixels,” later in this chap-
ter. Also, if you’re moving a selection on a layer, you’re left with transparent
pixels (see Book VI).
The Move tool has a few options residing in the Options bar that are mostly
relevant when working with layers. For a description of these options, see
Book VI, Chapter 2.

Moving and Cloning Selections
251
Figure 2-8: When you move a selection by using the Move tool, 
you leave a hole that reveals the background color.
Cloning
If you don’t want to leave a hole in your image, you can copy and move the
selection, leaving the original image intact, as shown in Figure 2-9. Just hold
down the Alt key (Option on the Mac) and drag when using the Move tool.
This action is often referred to as cloning because you’re essentially making
a duplicate of a selected area and then moving that duplicate elsewhere.
Moving the selection outline, but not the pixels
If all you want to do is move the selection outline without moving the pixels
underneath, for example, to better center an elliptical selection around what
you want, avoid using the Move tool. Instead, choose any selection tool — a
Marquee or Lasso tool — and then click anywhere inside the selection and just
drag. That way, you move only the outline of the element, not the pixels of the
element itself. You can also use the arrow keys to nudge a selection marquee.

Transforming Pixels
After you select an element, you may find you need to resize or reorient that
element. Transforming involves scaling, rotating, skewing, distorting, flip-
ping, or adjusting the perspective of your pixels. Although you may con-
sider these types of transformations somewhat pedestrian, we’re sure you’ll
find them practical and useful in your daily digital-imaging chores.
Follow these steps to transform a selection:
1. Create your selection.
We’ll leave this task up to you; just use your selection expertise (or
refer to Book IV, Chapter 1 for assistance).
You can also apply transformations to a layer or to multiple layers.
(For more on this topic, see Book VI.)

Transforming Pixels
253
2. If you need to rotate the selection, choose Image➪Rotate.
• Free Rotate Selection: Enables you to manually rotate the selection.
• Selection 180°, 90° Left, or 90° Right: Rotates the selection by speci-
fied amounts.
• Flip Selection Horizontal or Vertical: Flips your selection along the
vertical or horizontal axis, respectively.
The other rotate commands have to do with layers. See Book VI,
Chapter 1 for more info. 
3. To scale the selection, choose Image➪Resize➪Scale.
4. To freely transform, skew, distort, or adjust the perspective of a sec-
tion, choose Image➪Transform and choose a transformation type
from the submenu:
• Free Transform: Enables you to rotate, resize, skew, distort, and
adjust perspective all within a single command. See the sidebar for
more on this productive command.
• Skew: Distorts your selection on a given axis.
• Distort: Distorts your selection with no restrictions on an axis.
• Perspective: Applies a one-point perspective to your selection.
As soon as you select your desired distortion and release the mouse
button, a box called the bounding box or transform box surrounds your
selection, complete with handles on the sides and corners. You don’t
get a bounding box when you select the Flip or Rotate (by degrees)
transformations (these commands just get applied to your image).
5. Depending on which transformation type you choose in Steps 2, 3, or
4, drag the appropriate handle:
• Free Rotate: Move your cursor outside the bounding box. When 
the cursor becomes a curved arrow, drag clockwise or counter-
clockwise. Hold down Shift to rotate in 15-degree increments.
Remember choosing Rotate 180°, 90° CW, or 90° CCW, or Flip
Horizontal or Vertical just executes the command. Handle-dragging
isn’t necessary.
• Scale: Corner handles work best for this transformation. Hold down
Shift to scale proportionately. Hold down the Alt key (Option on the
Mac) to scale from the center.
• Skew: Drag a side handle.
• Distort: Drag a corner handle.
• Perspective: Drag a corner handle.

Chapter 2

Elements executes all the transformations around a point called the ref-
erence point. The reference point appears in the center of the transform
box by default. You can move the reference point anywhere you want,
even outside the bounding box. In addition, you can set your own refer-
ence point for the transformation by clicking a square on the reference
point locator on the Options bar. Each square corresponds to a point on
the bounding box.
Execute all your transformations in one fell swoop, as shown in
Figure 2-10, if possible. In other words, don’t scale a selection now
and then five minutes later rotate it, and then five minutes after that dis-
tort it. Every time you apply a transformation to an image, you’re put-
ting it through a resampling process. You want to limit how many times
you resample an image because it has a degrading effect — your image
starts to appear soft and mushy. Only flipping or rotating in 90-degree
increments is resample-free. For more on resampling, see Book III,
Chapter 1.
6. After you transform the selection to your liking, double-click inside
the bounding box, or click the Commit button on the Options bar.
To cancel the transformation, press Esc or click the Cancel button on
the Options bar.
Your selection is now magically transformed. If your image isn’t on a
layer, you can end up with a hole filled with the background color after
your image is transformed. Check out Book VI on layers to avoid this
calamity.
Distorting selected pixels with Free Transform
An efficient way to apply multiple transforma-
tions is to use the Free Transform command.
Like the Transform command, the Free
Transform command surrounds the selection
with a bounding box. Within the bounding box,
you can scale, rotate, skew, distort, or apply
perspective without having to choose the indi-
vidual distortions. You just have to use the right
keyboard shortcuts. To scale and rotate, use the
same method as the Image➪Scale and Image➪
Rotate➪Free Rotate commands. Here’s the
scoop on the rest:
 Skew: Ctrl+Shift-drag (Ô+Shift-drag on the
Mac) on a side or corner handle.
 Distort: Ctrl-drag (Ô-drag on the Mac) on
any handle.
 Perspective: Ctrl+Shift+Alt-drag (Ô+Shift+
Option-drag on the Mac) on a corner handle.
If you forget these tedious keyboard shortcuts,
simply right-click with the mouse (Control+click
on the Mac) to access a context-sensitive menu
with the transform commands from which you
can then select.

Removing an Element from an Image
Sometimes, you remove a distracting element from a picture to provide a stronger focal
point. Or maybe you just don’t want the element in the image. But remember, if you simply
delete an unwanted element without cloning, you leave a hole (colored with the back-
ground color) in place of the element. Probably not what you want.
Follow these steps to remove an unwanted element (in this case, a bystander) from an
image:
When you first attempt this technique, start
with an image that has an element not physically attached to something you want to
keep in the image.
1. Open an image that contains some-
thing you want to remove.
2. Use the selection tool of your choice
to select the element that you want to
remove.
In this step, you’re creating a selection
border that you use to clone another
area of the image.
You don’t have to be super-precise, so
feel free to grab a Lasso tool. When
you make your selection, be careful 
not to cut off any portion of the ele-
ment. Otherwise, you leave some 
stray pixels — a dead giveaway 
that something was once there. Using
the Polygonal Lasso tool, we made a
rough outline around the bystander on
the right, as shown in the following
figure.

3. Position your cursor inside the selection border, press and hold the mouse button,
and drag your selection to move it horizontally (or vertically, if the image warrants
it) to an area of the photo that you want to clone.
The selection border, shown in the following figure, is the only thing that we moved.
4. With the Move tool selected, position your cursor inside the selection marquee,
hold down Alt key (Option on the Mac), and then drag to move the cloned area on
top of the element that you’re removing. Carefully match up the edges, as shown
in the figure, and release your mouse button, and then release the Alt key (Option
on the Mac).
Area to be cloned
continued

5. Choose Select➪Deselect.
The cloned area now covers the element that you want to remove, as shown in the
following figure. In the example, the sky selection now covers the bystander.
Depending on your image, you may want to choose Select ➪Feather and enter a
pixel or so before you move the cloned area. Feathering softens the edges and
smoothes out the transition between the cloned area and the background. We didn’t
feather our selection because it wasn’t necessary. Try it both ways to see which
looks better. Use the Undo History panel to undo your steps, if necessary.
The final step is to clean up any telltale signs that the element was there.

6. Select the Clone Stamp tool and
select a medium-size feathered brush
from the Brush Preset picker on the
Options bar, hold down the Alt key
(Option on the Mac), and click a good
area next to a seam or flaw; release
the Alt key (Option on the Mac) and
then click the flaw.
If the Clone Stamp is a mystery to 
you, be sure to check out Book VIII,
Chapter 1.
Repeat this step until you fix all the
flaws and the clone blends in seam-
lessly with the background. Don’t get
carried away with the Clone Stamp
tool, or you may end up with a smudgy
mess. Being light-handed is a good
thing, as we were in the now-retouched
image. Nobody can tell that the awe-
some snowboarder had an audience at
one time.

eel free to keep on your street clothes for this chapter on drawing and
painting. The tools you work with in Elements are self-cleaning and
don’t require that you wear a smock. Painting is one of the basic skills you
need to have down pat in Elements. After you get familiar with the tech-
nique of painting strokes and working with brushes, you’re well on your way
to mastering more-advanced skills, such as retouching, which come easier
to you if you’ve already got some strong painting skills under your belt. 
In tandem with painting, of course, comes drawing. Elements’
shape tools add an important dimension to your drawing
capabilities. This chapter introduces you to a plethora
of tools and techniques. We start with painting and
then move on to drawing. Master both, and they can
serve you well.
Introducing the Pencil and Brush Tools
The Pencil and Brush tools are like chocolate and
mint. Not only do they work well together, but they
also share many important attributes. Just as impor-
tant, however, are their differences. You can access these
tools in the Tools panel. Press B to make the Brush tool
appear by default. By pressing Shift+B, you can toggle between
the Brush tool, the Impressionist Brush, and the Color Replacement
tools. Strangely enough, to access the Pencil, which shares the same fly-out
menu, press N.

Introducing the Pencil and Brush Tools
264
Drawing with the Pencil tool 
The Pencil and Brush tools are very
much alike, except that the Pencil tool
has hard edges whereas the Brush tool
can have soft, feathered edges. In fact,
the edges of a pencil stroke can’t even
be anti-aliased. Keep in mind that if
you draw anything other than vertical
or horizontal lines, the lines have
some jaggies when they’re viewed up
close. But hey, don’t dismiss the
Pencil. Those hard strokes can work
great for Web graphics because they
lend themselves to producing crisp-
edged images for display in a browser
window. What’s more, the Pencil tool
can erase itself, and it’s great for digi-
tal sketches, as shown in Figure 1-1.
You can do all the following with the
Pencil tool:
 Drag the mouse to draw freehand lines.
 Click at one point, release the mouse button, and then Shift-click at a
second point to draw a straight line between the points. As long as you
hold down the Shift key, you can keep clicking to draw straight lines
between each of the points.
 Press the Alt key (the Option key on the Mac) and click any area of
color in the drawing to switch the foreground color to that hue.
To try out the Pencil tool, follow these steps:
1. Select the Pencil tool from the Tools panel.
The Pencil tool shares a fly-out menu with the Brush tool. You can press
N to make it appear if it’s hidden underneath the Brush tool.
2. In the Options bar, choose your pencil options. Options include
• Brush preset: By default, the Pencil tool’s brush tip is the 1-pixel
brush. Click the arrow and select your desired brush from the Brush
Preset Picker drop-down panel that appears.
• Brush size: A preset brush’s pixel diameters are shown as text below
a thumbnail image of the brush shape. If you want to change the size
of that brush tip, drag the Size slider or enter a value.

• To load another preset library, click the Brushes pop-up menu at the
top of the panel. You also find options to save, rename, or delete
individual brushes and also save, load, and reset brush libraries.
3. If you want to draw using anything other than Normal mode, select a
mode from the Mode options menu in the Options bar.
Blend modes alter the interaction of the color you’re applying with the
color on your canvas. See more on blend modes in Book VI, Chapter 3.
4. In the Options bar, specify an opacity percentage for your pencil
strokes.
If you want your background to show partially through your strokes,
select an opacity of less than 100 percent by using the slider or by
typing an opacity percentage directly into the text box. The lower the
percentage, the more the background images show through.
Your strokes must be on a separate layer above your images for you to
be able to adjust the opacity and blend modes after you draw them. For
more on layers, see Book VI, Chapter 1.
5. Select Auto Erase to enable that option.
This option erases portions of your pencil strokes. For example, say
that the foreground color is black and the background color is white,
and you apply some black strokes. With Auto Erase enabled, you apply
white if you drag back over the black strokes. If you drag over the white
background, you apply black.
6. Click and drag with the mouse to create your pencil lines.
Painting with the Brush tool
The Brush tool is a popular tool used throughout Elements in various incar-
nations, so getting to know this tool and how it operates is a good idea.
The most important difference between the Brush and the Pencil tools is
that, by default, the Brush tool produces soft-edged lines, as shown in Figure
1-2. How soft those strokes are depends on which brush you use. By default,
even the hardest brush has a slightly soft edge because it’s anti-aliased. Anti-
aliasing creates a single row of partially filled pixels along the edges to pro-
duce the illusion of a smooth edge. You can also get even softer brushes,
which employ feathering. 
Although jagged edges are most apparent in diagonal lines, Elements applies
anti-aliasing to brush-stroke edges, even in horizontal and vertical lines.

Figure 1-2: Strokes from the Pencil and Brush vary in the softness of their edges.
The Brush tool shares most of the basic options found in the Pencil tool,
except the Auto Erase feature isn’t available. 
Here are a few tips on working with the Brush tool and its unique options:
 Select the Brush tool from the Tools panel, or press B (or Shift+B) until
you get the Brush.
 In the Options bar, click the arrow and select your desired brush tip
from the Brush Preset Picker drop-down panel that appears.
 Select a mode and opacity from the options on the Options bar.
 Drag to paint, click and Shift-click to paint straight lines, and hold down
the Shift key while dragging to constrain the Brush tool to horizontal or
vertical lines.
 Press the Alt key (the Option key on the Mac) and click any area of
color to switch the foreground color to that color.
The Brush tool has several other options to select from:
 Airbrush: Click the Airbrush button on the Options bar to apply the
Airbrush mode. This mode produces the spray effect you get with a tra-
ditional airbrush. The longer you hold down the mouse button, the
more paint pumps out of the tool, and the wider the airbrush effect
spreads, as shown in Figure 1-3.

 Tablet Options: If you’re using a
pressure-sensitive digital drawing
tablet, check the settings you want
the tablet to control, including
size, scatter, opacity, roundness,
and hue jitter (switching of color
between foreground and back-
ground colors). The harder you
press with the stylus, the greater
the effect of these options.
 More Options: In the Options bar,
click the Brush icon to access
additional options, referred to as
brush dynamics. Brush dynamics
enable you to change the brush
strokes as you apply them. Here is
a quick lowdown on each option,
shown in Figure 1-4:
• Fade: The lower the value, the
quicker the stroke fades. Zero,
however, creates no fade.
• Hue Jitter: This option varies the stroke between the foreground
and background colors. The higher the value, the more frequent the
variation.
• Scatter: The higher the value, the higher the number of brush marks
and the farther apart they are.
• Keep These Settings for All Brushes: You can lock in these brush
dynamics by selecting this check box, ensuring that every brush you
select adopts these settings.
• Spacing: The higher the number, the more space between marks.
• Hardness: The higher the value, the harder the brush.
• Angle: If you create an oval brush by adjusting the roundness, this
option controls the angle of that oval brush stroke. It’s much easier
to drag the points and the arrow on the diagram than to “guessti-
mate” values in the text boxes.
• Roundness: A setting of 100 percent is totally circular. The lower the
percentage, the more elliptical your brush becomes.

 Delete Brush: Eliminate an unwanted brush with this option.
 Reset Brushes: Reverts your current brush library to the default.
 Save Brushes: Saves custom brushes in a separate library.
 Load Brushes: Loads a preset or custom brush library. They have
names like Special Effect Brushes and Faux Finish Brushes. Select one
to append the brushes to your current set or to replace the current set
with the library you select. (A dialog box appears that offers a choice of
either action.)

 The display options: A set of commands that enable you to change the
way your brush tips are displayed in the drop-down panel. The default
view is Stroke Thumbnail, which displays the appearance of the stroke.
Other commands include Text Only (text names of brush tips), Small
and Large Thumbnail (thumbnail images with diameter in pixels), and
Small and Large List (thumbnail images with text names).
You can also manage brush tip libraries by using the Preset Manager. See
Book I, Chapter 4 for details on using the Preset Manager.
Getting artsy with the Impressionist Brush
The Impressionist Brush is designed to paint over your photos in a way that
makes them look like fine art paintings. You can set various options that
change the style of the brush strokes.
Here’s how to use this artistic brush:
1. Select the Impressionist Brush from the Tools panel.
It looks like a brush with a curlicue next to it. You can also press B, or
Shift+B, to cycle through the brushes.
2. Set the brush options.
The Brushes, Size, Mode, and Opacity options are identical to those for
the Brush tool, described in the previous section “Painting with the
Brush tool.” You can also find some unique options on the More Options
panel, indicated by the Impressionist Brush icon:
• Style: This drop-down list contains various brush stroke styles, such
as Dab and Tight Curl.
• Area: Controls the size of your brush stroke. The larger the value,
the larger the area covered.
• Tolerance: Controls how similar color pixels have to be before
they’re changed by the brush stroke.
3. Drag on your image and paint with your brush strokes, as shown in
Figure 1-5.
The best way to get familiar with the Impressionist Brush is to open
your favorite image and experiment with the tool.
Creating a custom brush
After playing with all the various options, if you really like the personalized
brush you’ve created, save it as a preset so that you can access it again and
again. Click the arrow at the top of the Brush Preset Picker panel and

Figure 1-5: The Impressionist Brush transforms your photo into a painting.
There’s one other way to create a brush. Elements enables you to create a
brush from all or part of your image. The image can be a photograph or
something you’ve painted or drawn.

Creating Shapes
271
Here’s how to create a brush from your image:
1. Select part of your image with any of the selection tools.
If you want to use the entire image or entire layer, deselect everything.
For more on selections, see Book IV, Chapter 1.
2. Choose Edit➪Define Brush or Edit➪Define Brush from Selection.
You see one command or the other, depending on what you do in Step 1.
3. Name the brush and click OK in the dialog box.
The new brush shows up at the bottom of your Brush Preset Picker
drop-down panel. Note that your brush is only a grayscale version of
your image. When you use the brush, it automatically applies the color
you’ve selected as your foreground color, as shown in Figure 1-6.

Creating Shapes
Although we’re big fans of photos and pixels, sometimes you have the need
for a vector shape or two. Maybe you need to create a button for a Web page

or a simple logo for a poster. In these instances, drawing a vector shape
with one of the shape tools does the job.
Before we discuss the ins and outs of creating shapes, here’s a little
overview that explains the difference between pixels and vectors (both
types are shown in Figure 1-7):
Figure 1-7: Elements images fall into one of two camps — vector or pixel.

Colorizing Black-and-White Images
Just as there are artistic reasons for shooting a photo in black and white, there are also
valid arguments for converting a grayscale image into a color one. Perhaps the picture is
an old one, taken before color film was widely used, and you want to colorize it. Or you
may come across a monochrome image that would look more interesting in color.
Elements can let you add back the missing colors to your original black-and-white
pictures or can give you free rein to create your own customized color image.

In our example, we chose a black-and-white photo of an adorable little girl. Rather than
trying to duplicate a color photograph, we want to apply a technique that mimics the
subtle, hand-colored look of the Marshall’s Photo Coloring System of pigments, photo
oils, spot colors, retouch pencils, and other products popular in the ’50s and ’60s. You
may have also seen this look used in greeting cards featuring children. 
1. Open a grayscale image in Elements.
2. Choose Image➪Mode➪RGB Color to convert the grayscale image to a full-color
image (even though it currently lacks color).
3. Choose Layer➪New➪Layer.
This creates a new transparent layer to paint on, as shown in the figure. Although
you can paint directly on an image, using a blank layer is safer — and gives you
more flexibility in editing when you make a mistake. (For more information on work-
ing with layers, see Book VI, Chapter 1.)

4. In the New Layer dialog box that appears, name the layer and then click OK.
You can paint all your colors on a single layer, but you may find that using a separate
layer for each part of the face lets you fade that color in and out as required to
blend smoothly with your other hues.
5. Select the Color mode from the Blend Mode drop-down list in the Layers panel.
Elements uses this mode to combine the painting layer with the image layer,
enabling you to apply color while retaining the details of the underlying image.
6. Select a color you want to apply from the Swatches panel or use the Color panel to
mix your own.
For details on using color, see Book III, Chapter 4.
7. Select the Brush tool from the Tools panel.
8. Click the down arrow next to the Brush Preset Picker on the Options bar and
select a brush from the drop-down panel.
Start with a soft-edged brush.
The Airbrush option on the Options bar creates a very subtle and soft effect. Just be
sure you pick the kind of brush that works best for the area of the picture you’re col-
orizing. (Use a small, fuzzy brush for smaller areas, and use a bigger, sharper brush
for more defined lines and wider areas.)
9. Paint all the parts of the image where you want to apply color.
If you make a mistake, you can use the Eraser tool (or the Undo History panel, see
Book III, Chapter 5) to erase the bad strokes without affecting the underlying
grayscale image because you’re painting on a separate layer.
In our example, we chose a nice, light blue to change the color of the girl’s eyes, as
shown in the figure. A small, fuzzy brush is perfect for a small area such as the eyes.

image’s main components and repeat Steps 4 through 9 with an additional color.
We painted the eyes, lips, cheeks, hair, and hair highlights separately because cre-
ating natural, subtle effects with people’s skin, hair, and eyes takes a special touch:
 Eyes: When painting the eyes, paint only the irises and leave the pupils their
original black color. Don’t paint over the catchlights in the eyes, either.
(Catchlights are reflections of light sources, such as windows or the flash.)
 Lips: Color the inner surface of the lips a darker, rosier pink than the outer sur-
face. Lips look best when portrayed in at least two shades. Don’t forget to color
the gums with an even lighter pink.
 Hair: Hair looks best when the highlights and darker portions are slightly differ-
ent colors.
 Cheeks: To put a little blush in the cheeks, choose the Airbrush option on the
Options bar and work with a relatively large brush size. Apply a good dash of
color to each cheek and a lighter bit of color to the forehead and chin.

11.For the overall skin tone, we chose a different technique, using the Hue/Saturation
command. This technique works especially well with those who have naturally dark
complexions. You can choose to paint the skin with a brush or use this technique:
 Duplicate the grayscale Background layer and then choose Enhance➪Adjust
Color➪Hue/Saturation.
 Choose the Colorize option and move the Hue slider to the left to produce a
sepia tone. I set my Hue to 36. Set Saturation to 25 percent and click OK to col-
orize this layer.
 Use the Eraser tool to remove everything in the colorized layer that isn’t skin. In
our example, we removed the hair, background, eyes, lips, teeth, and clothing.
This result is a nice sepia tone to the face.

Be sure to pick a color that’s as close to life as possible. If the subject has darker
skin, you may need to move away from rosier blush tones.
12.When you finish coloring your layers, you can experiment with different opacity levels
for each colorized layer to see whether more-transparent hues might look better.

 Pixel images describe a shape in terms of a grid of pixels. When you
increase the size of a pixel-based image, it loses quality and begins to
look blocky, mushy, and otherwise nasty. For more details on resizing
pixel-based images and the ramifications of doing so, see Book III,
Chapter 1.
 Vectors describe a shape mathematically. The shapes comprise paths
made up of lines, curves, and anchor points. Because vector shapes are
math based, you can resize them without any loss of quality whatsoever.
When you create a shape in Elements, you’re creating a vector-based ele-
ment. Shapes reside on a special kind of layer called, not surprisingly, a
shape layer.
Drawing a shape
Elements offers an assortment of shape tools for you to choose from. Follow
these steps to draw a shape in your document:
1. Select a shape tool from the Tools panel.
You can also press U, or Shift+U to cycle through the tools. You can
select from the following shape tools (shown in Figure 1-8):
• Rectangle/Ellipse: The Rectangle and Ellipse shapes have no special
parameters on the Options bar; however, they both behave much
like their counterparts among the selection tools. Hold down the
Shift key while dragging a shape to produce a perfect square or
circle; hold down Shift+Alt (Shift+Option on the Mac) to additionally
draw the shape outward from the center. 
• Rounded Rectangle: This shape has the same options as the
Rectangle, with the addition of a radius value used to round off the
corners of the rectangle.
• Polygon: This tool creates a polygon with a specified number of
sides, from 3 to 100.
• Line: Creates a line with a width from 1 to 1,000 pixels. You can also
add an arrowhead at either or both ends.
• Custom: You can find numerous preset custom shapes to choose
from. As with any shape, you hold down the Shift key to constrain
proportions or the Alt key (Option on the Mac) to draw from the
center out.
2. In the Options bar, click the down-pointing arrow just to the right of
the shape tools to specify geometry options.
Each shape has its own options. For a detailed explanation, see the sec-
tion “Specifying Geometry options,” later in this chapter.

Figure 1-8: The shape tools and Options bar give you all you need to make 
shapes, from the simple to the ornate.
If you chose the Custom Shape tool in Step 1, click the down-pointing
arrow to access the drop-down Custom Shapes panel and choose your
desired shape. You can access more preset shape libraries via the 
pop-up menu at the top of the panel.

3. Select your desired color from the Color drop-down panel on the
Options bar.
Click the More Colors button (down-pointing arrow) to access the Color
Picker for additional color choices.
4. Select a style from the Style drop-down panel.
To spice up the shape with bevels and interesting edges, choose a style
from the panel. For more on styles, see Book VII, Chapter 3.
5. Drag in the document to draw the shape you’ve defined.
The shape appears in the Image
window on its very own shape
layer. Check out the Layers panel
to see this phenomenon. Figure 1-9
shows our shape, an Elvis do.
Drawing multiple shapes
in a shape layer
After you create a shape layer, you can
draw additional shapes on that layer.
You can add, subtract, overlap, and
intersect shapes in exactly the same
way you do with selections, as
described in Book IV, Chapter 2. Follow
these steps:
1. After you create the first shape, as we explain in the preceding sec-
tion, select a state button on the Options bar:
• Add to Shape Area: Combines and joins two or more shapes
• Subtract from Shape Area: Subtracts one shape from another shape
• Intersect Shape Areas: Creates a shape only from the areas that overlap
• Exclude Overlapping Shape Areas: Creates a shape from only the
areas that don’t overlap
2. Choose a shape tool and draw the next shape.
We finished our drawing, as shown in Figure 1-10, by adding a face to
our Elvis impersonator.

Specifying Geometry options
Geometry options for your shapes
help define how the shapes look. Click
the down-pointing arrow at the end of
the row of Shape tools on the Options
bar to access the Geometry options
described in the following sections.
Rectangle and Rounded Rectangle
Geometry options
Here are the Geometry options for the
Rectangle and Rounded Rectangle
shapes:
 Unconstrained: Enables you to
freely draw a rectangle of any
shape or size.
 Square: Constrains the shape to a perfect square. (You can also hold
down the Shift key to do the same thing on the fly.)
 Fixed Size: Lets you draw rectangles only in fixed sizes. Specify the
exact size by entering a width and height.
 Proportional: Enables you to define an aspect ratio, or proportion, for
the rectangle. Type 3 into the W box and 4 into the H box to constrain
yourself to drawing any sized rectangle with fixed proportions in a 
3:4 ratio.
 From Center: Enables you to draw the shape from the center outward.
 Snap to Pixels: Aligns the edges of a rectangle or rounded rectangle to
the pixels on your screen.
 Radius: For rounded rectangles, uses an inscribed circle of the given
radius to round off the corners of a rectangle. 
Elliptical-shape Geometry options
The Ellipse shape has many of the same options available for rectangles. Of
course, instead of being able to create a perfect square, you can restrain the
shape to be a perfect circle. Also, the Snap to Pixels option (available for
rectangles) doesn’t exist for ellipses.

Polygon Geometry options
These are the Geometry options for the polygon:
 Radius: Controls the distance from the center of a polygon to its outer
points.
 Smooth Corners: Rounds off the corners.
 Star: Creates an inward-pointing polygon, also known as a star.
 Indent Sides By: Determines the amount the sides indent inward.
 Smooth Indents: Rounds off the inner of indented sides.
 Sides: Lets you indicate the number of sides for a polygon or the
number of points for a star.
Line Geometry options
The Line shape’s Geometry settings include whether to put arrowheads at
the start or end of the line, or both. You can also specify the width, length,
and concavity settings which affect the arrowhead shapes.
Custom Shape Geometry options
The Custom Shape options are similar to those you can find for the other
shapes — with a couple of additions:
 Defined Proportions: Draws a shape based on the original proportions
you used when you created it.
 Defined Size: Draws a shape based on its original size when you
created it. 
Editing shapes
You can edit shapes that you create by using a variety of tools and tech-
niques. Here’s a list of the things you can do to modify your shapes:
 Select: Choose the Shape Selection tool to move one or more shapes in
their layers. This tool shares a fly-out menu with the Shapes tools.
 Move: Choose the Move tool (press V) to move the entire contents of
the shape layer.
 Delete: Select a shape and press Delete to remove it.

transformation.
 Change the color: Double-click the thumbnail of the shape layer on the
Layers panel. This action takes you to the Color Picker, where you can
choose a new color.
 Clone a shape: Hold down the Alt key (Option on the Mac) and move
the shape with the Move tool.
To convert your vector-based shape into a pixel-based shape, click the
Simplify button on the Options bar or choose Layer➪Simplify Layer. Note
that you can’t edit a shape after you simplify it, except to modify the pixels.
But you can now apply filters to the layer. See Book VII, Chapter 1 for more
on fun with filters.

Chapter 2: Filling and Stroking
In This Chapter
 Filling and stroking selections
 Pouring with the Paint Bucket tool
 Working with gradients
 Creating and applying patterns
E
lements offers several ways to create elements (say, geometric shapes)
out of pixels. Filling and stroking such elements are two of the most
popular commands at your disposal. The Fill command adds a color or a
pattern to the entire selection, whereas the Stroke command applies the
color to only the edge of the selection border. 
This chapter shows you how to fill and stroke your selections. If filling and
stroking with solid color is just too mundane for you, we also show you how
to create and apply multicolored gradient blends as well as the best ways to
make and use patterns. After reading this chapter, you’ll have your “fill” of
different fills and strokes. 
Note that you want to be in the Editor in Full Edit mode for
your filling, stroking, gradient, and pattern activities.
Filling a Selection with a Solid Color
You won’t find a Fill tool on the Tools panel.
Elements avoids the crowded panel and places
the Fill and Stroke commands on the Edit menu.
When you want to fill your selection with just a
solid color, you use either the foreground or back-
ground color. (These colors appear at the bottom of
the Tools panel, as we explain in Book III, Chapter 4.) 
The following steps show you the basics of filling a
selection with either the foreground or background color:
1. Choose the selection tool of your choice and create your
selection on a layer.

Filling a Selection with a Solid Color
284
Although you don’t have to create a new layer, we recommend it. That
way, if you don’t like the filled selection, you can delete the layer, and
the image or background below it remains safe. See Book IV for all you
need to know about selections and Book VI for the scoop on layers.
2. In the Tools panel, select either the foreground or background color
and then choose a fill color.
If you need information on choosing a color, see Book III, Chapter 4.
3. Choose Edit➪Fill Selection.
Note that if you don’t have an active selection border in your image, the
command says Fill Layer and your entire layer is filled with your color
or pattern.
The Fill dialog box, shown in
Figure 2-1, appears.
4. Choose your desired fill from the
Use pop-up menu.
You can select whether to fill with
the foreground or background
color. 
You also can choose Color, Black,
50% Gray, White, or Pattern. If you
select Color or Pattern, you must
complete a couple additional
steps, described in the next sec-
tion “Filling Options and Tips.”
5. In the blending area, you can
specify whether to preserve transparency. This option enables you to
fill only the portions of the selection that contain pixels (the non-
transparent areas).
Although you can also choose a blend mode (how the fill color interacts
with colors below it) as well as an opacity percentage in the Fill Layer
dialog box, we can’t really recommend doing so. Make adjustments on
your layer later using the Layers panel commands. This gives you more
flexibility for editing.
6. Click OK.
The color or pattern that you chose fills the selection.
Figure 2-1: Fill your selection with color
or a pattern.

Filling Options and Tips
285
Filling Options and Tips
After you make a selection, you’re ready to use one of the filling options.
You can use the Fill dialog box (as described in the preceding section) to fill
the selection with the foreground or background color; you can also choose
to fill the selection with color, black, white, or gray. Elements is full of short-
cuts and options. 
Here are just a few. With the selection active
 Press Alt+Backspace (Option+Delete on the Mac) to fill it with the fore-
ground color. All areas within the selection, including transparent areas,
fill with the color.
 Press Alt+Shift+Backspace (or Option+Shift+Delete on the Mac) to fill
only the pixels in a selection with the foreground color, leaving any
transparent pixels untouched. 
 If you’re working on the Background layer, you can also fill the selection
with the background color by pressing the Backspace (Delete on the
Mac) key. (Pressing Backspace/Delete on other layers creates a trans-
parent area that shows the image in the layer underneath the selection.)
 By selecting the Color option from the Contents drop-down menu in the
Fill dialog box, you access the Color Picker where you can select any
color your heart desires to fill your selection. For more on using the
Color Picker, see Book III, Chapter 4.
 Select the Pattern option from the Contents drop-down menu in the Fill
dialog box to fill the selection with a pattern. Click the arrow next to the
pattern swatch and select a pattern from the drop-down panel. Click OK.
To access additional pattern libraries, click the Pattern panel pop-up
menu to select more pattern libraries.
 Paint part or all the interior of the selection by using a Pencil or Brush
tool. This option lets you partially fill a selection using a bit of flexibility
and creativity. When you paint a selection using Brush tools, Elements
confines the paint inside the boundaries of your selection, as shown in
Figure 2-2. For more on painting, see Book V, Chapter 1.
 Pour color from the Paint Bucket tool into the selection. (See more
details in the next section.)

Figure 2-2: The marquee confines your brush strokes to the selected area.
Pouring with the Paint Bucket Tool
The Paint Bucket tool operates much like a combination of the Fill com-
mand tool and the Magic Wand tool. It makes a selection based on similarly
colored pixels and then immediately fills that selection with color or a
pattern. Just like the Magic Wand tool, this tool is used the most success-
fully when you have a limited number of colors, as shown in Figure 2-3.
To use the Paint Bucket tool, select it and click the area you want to fill with
color. If you want a more precise fill, first make a selection and then click
inside the selection border. It’s as simple as that. Before you click, however,
specify your options, all of which are on the Options bar:
 Fill: Select whether to fill with the foreground color or a pattern. If you
want to use the foreground color, leave Pattern unchecked.

 Pattern: If you select Pattern, select a preset pattern from the drop-
down panel. You can also load patterns from pattern libraries or create
a pattern of your own. Find more information on patterns in the section,
“Working with Patterns,” later in this chapter.
 Mode: Select a blending mode to change how the fill color interacts with
the color below it. Find details on these modes in Book VI, Chapter 3.
 Opacity: Adjust this value to make the fill more or less transparent.
 Tolerance: Just as you did with the Magic Wand tool, choose a Tolerance
level (0 to 255) that specifies how similar in color a pixel must be before
it’s selected and then filled. For more on Tolerance, see Book IV, Chapter 1.
 Anti-Alias: Choose this option to smooth the edges between the filled
and unfilled areas.
 Contiguous: If selected, this option selects and fills only pixels that are
touching within your selection. If the option is unselected, pixels are
selected and filled wherever they lie within your selection and within
your tolerance range.
 All Layers: This option selects and fills pixels within the selection in all
layers that are within the tolerance range. 
As with other tools that fill, you can prevent the Paint Bucket tool from fill-
ing the transparent pixels. Just select the Transparency icon in the Lock
area of the Layers panel.

Stroking

Stroking a Selection
288
Stroking a Selection
Stroking enables you to create colored outlines, or borders, of selections or
layers. It’s up to you to decide whether to put the border inside, outside, or
centered on the selection. 
To stroke a selection, follow these steps:
1. In the Tools panel, choose a foreground color.
2. In the image, make a selection on a layer using the selection tool of
your choice.
Although you don’t have to create a new layer to stroke a selection, we
recommend it. That way, if you don’t like the stroked selection, you can
just delete the layer and your document remains unadulterated.
3. Choose Edit➪Stroke (Outline) Selection.
4. In the Stroke dialog box, specify options, as shown in Figure 2-4:
• Width: Enter a width of 1 to 250 pixels. 
• Color: Click in the Color box to select the hue you want from the
Color Picker.
• Location: Specify how Elements should apply the stroke in relation
to your selection border. Note that the Inside option always gives
you sharp corners on a rectangle. The Center and Outside options
can result in blunt corners.
• Mode: This determines how the stroke color interacts with other
colors on the same layer.
• Opacity: The default value is 100%. If you want the stroke to be semi-
transparent, enter a lower value.
• Preserve Transparency: Select this option to apply the stroke only to
nontransparent pixels.
5. Click OK to apply the stroke.
We gave a 10-pixel centered stroke to our selection, as shown in Figure 2-4.
Instead of using the Stroke dialog box to adjust the Mode and Opacity set-
tings, we recommend creating a new layer for the stroke and then choosing
different Mode and Opacity settings in the Layers panel. This approach
gives you better flexibility in editing.

Working with Multicolored Gradients
If one color just doesn’t get you fired up, you’ll be happy to know that
Elements enables you to fill a selection or layer with a gradient. A gradient is
a blend of two or more colors that gradually dissolve from one into another.
Elements provides a lot of preset gradients. But creating your own custom
gradient is also fun and simple to do.
You can create the following gradient effects:
 Foreground to background: A transition from the current foreground
color to the background color
 Foreground to transparent: A transition from the current foreground
color to transparent, allowing whatever’s under the transparent portion
to show through

 Black to white: A transition from black to white
 An array of colorful selections: A transition including rainbows, cop-
pery sheens, and other effects
You can load other libraries of gradients from those found in the menu of
the Gradient panel. They have names such as Color Harmonies, Metals, and
Special Effects. 
In addition to being able to control the appearance and application of a
gradient, you can also specify various Gradient options, all of which are on
the Options bar:
 Mode: Select a blending mode to change how the color of the gradient
interacts with the colors below it.
 Opacity: Select how opaque or transparent the gradient is.
 Reverse: Reverse the order in which the colors are applied.
 Dither: Add noise, or random information, to produce a smoother gradi-
ent that prints with less banding (color stripes caused by the limitations
of the printing process to reproduce a full range of colors).
 Transparency: Deselect this option to make Elements ignore any trans-
parent areas in the gradient, making them opaque instead.
Applying a preset gradient to a selection
Here’s how to apply a preset gradient:
1. Select the layer from the Layers panel. If you want the gradient to fill
only a portion of that layer, make your desired selection.
We recommend making the selection on a new layer so that you can
edit the gradient later without harming the underlying image.
If you don’t make a selection, the gradient is applied to the entire layer
or background.
2. Select the Gradient tool from the Tools panel, or press the G key.
3. Select one of the preset gradients from the Gradient Picker 
drop-down menu on the Options bar.
Remember that you can choose other preset libraries from the panel
pop-up menu. Libraries, such as Color Harmonies and Metals, contain
interesting presets.

Working with Multicolored Gradients
291
4. Select the gradient type by clicking one of the icons on the Options bar.
Figure 2-5 illustrates each gradient type:
• Linear: Blends the colors of the gradient in a straight line
• Radial: Blends the colors outward in a circular pattern
• Angle: Creates a counterclockwise sweep around the starting point,
resembling a radar screen
Figure 2-5: You can choose from five gradients.

• Reflected: Blends the colors by using symmetrical linear gradients
on either side of the starting point
• Diamond: Blends the colors outward in a diamond pattern
5. Choose any other options you want from the Options bar.
We explain these options earlier in this section.
6. Place the cursor at the position in the layer or selection where you
want to place the starting color of the gradient.
7. Drag in any direction to the end point for the gradient.
Longer drags result in a subtle transition between colors, whereas
shorter drags result in a more abrupt transition. Hold down the Shift
key while dragging to constrain the direction of the gradient so it is per-
fectly horizontal or vertical or at an exact 45-degree angle.
8. Release the mouse button to apply the gradient.
We applied a pastel radial gradient to a selection of an abstract symbol
in Figure 2-6. 
Figure 2-6: Fill your selection with a multicolored gradient.

Customizing and editing gradients
Although Elements includes dozens of different gradient presets, you may
want to create your own. The Gradient Editor makes that task an easy one
by letting you create your own custom gradient with as many colors as you
want, which you can then save as a preset and reuse at any time.
The Gradient Editor has a lot of options, but it’s easy to use when you know
what all the controls and options do. Follow these steps to create a simple,
smooth gradient:
1. Select the Gradient tool from the Tools panel or press the G key.
2. Click the Edit button on the Options bar.
The Gradient Editor dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 2-7.

3. Pick an existing gradient preset from the Presets area to use as the
basis for your new gradient.
4. Select Solid or Noise from the Gradient Type pop-up menu.
As soon as you start to edit the existing gradient, the name of the gradi-
ent changes to Custom. A Noise gradient is one containing random
colors. Because the colors are random, each time you create a noise
gradient, the result is different. 
5. If you chose a Solid gradient in Step 4, adjust the Smoothness per-
centage to determine how smoothly one color blends into another.
6. If you chose a Noise gradient in Step 4, specify the options that follow
and then skip to Step 15 to finish the gradient.
• Roughness: Adjust this slider to determine how smoothly or abruptly
the colors transition from one stop to another.
• Color Model: Select the color model to set the range of color. See
Book III, Chapter 4 for more on color models.
• Restrict Colors: Select this option to avoid oversaturated colors.
• Add Transparency: Select this option to include transparency in your
gradient, if desired.
• Randomize: Use this option to change the colors in the gradient.
Each time you click Randomize, you get a new set of colors.
7. If you’re creating a solid gradient, define the color of the starting point
for your gradient. Click the left color stop under the gradient bar.
The triangle above the stop turns black to indicate you’re working with
the starting point of the gradient. Because Noise gradients are random,
you can’t define the colors.
8. Select the starting color by using one of these methods:
• Double-click the left color stop and select a color from the Color
Picker that appears.
• Click the color swatch in the Stops area of the dialog box and
choose a color from the Select Stop Color dialog box that opens.
• Select Foreground, Background, or User Color from the Color pop-up
menu in the Stops area of the dialog box.

Working with Multicolored Gradients
295
If you select Color with the Foreground or Background option, the color
in the gradient changes automatically when you change the foreground
or background color. The change doesn’t affect any gradients you’ve
already created, but it does affect any future gradients. However, when
you open the Gradient Editor again, you can revert to the original fore-
ground or background color by selecting the User Color option from the
Color pop-up menu in the Stops area.
• Position the cursor (it appears as an eyedropper icon) anywhere in
the gradient bar to select a start color from the bar, or position the
cursor anywhere within an image on your screen and then click to
select the color under the cursor.
9. Click the end point color stop at the right side of the gradient bar and
use any of the methods described in Step 8 to choose the end color of
the gradient.
10. Change the percentage of the amount of one color versus the other by
moving the starting and ending points to the left or right. Drag the
midpoint slider (a diamond icon that appears when you click an adja-
cent color stop) to adjust where the colors mix equally, 50-50.
You can also change the position of the midpoint by selecting it and
typing a value into the Location box. The position of the color stops can
also be changed this way.
11. (Optional) To add another color, click below the gradient bar at the
position you want to add the color. Define a color using the new color
stop as you did in Step 8.
12. (Optional) Repeat Step 11 for additional colors.
13. For the additional color stops, move the stops to the left or right to
adjust the location of the start and end points for each color. Then,
adjust the midpoint sliders between the colors.
14. If you change your mind, you can redefine the color of the color stop
or remove a color stop altogether by dragging it down or up from its
position on the gradient bar.
15. After your edits are complete, enter a name for your gradient in the
Name field and then click the New button.
Your gradient is added to the Presets menu. Figure 2-8 shows an exam-
ple of a unique gradient that we created in the Gradient Editor.

Figure 2-8: The Gradient Editor gives you more creative license than the presets.
Adding transparency to a gradient
By default, a gradient has 100-percent opacity in the start color and progresses
to 100-percent opacity in the end color. If you like, you can have the gradient
fade out to transparency so that the portion of the image under the gradient
shows through. To add transparency to a gradient, follow these steps:
1. Create a gradient, as described in the preceding section.
2. Select the left opacity stop.
This stop is located just above the gradient bar, as shown in Figure 2-9.
3. Use the Opacity slider to specify the amount of transparency for the
gradient at its start point.
You can also type a value into the Opacity box.
4. Select the right opacity stop, and then slide the Opacity slider or
enter a percentage in the text box to specify transparency for the gra-
dient at its end point.
The lower the percentage, the less opaque the color.

Working with Multicolored Gradients
297
Figure 2-9: Add transparency to your gradients by adjusting the opacity of your colors.
5. Move the opacity stops to the right or left to adjust the location where
Elements applies each stop’s opacity setting.
6. Move the midpoint slider (diamond icon) to adjust how the color and
the transparency blend.
7. Click above the gradient bar to add more opacity stops if you want to
vary the transparency of the gradient at different points.
For example, you could fade transparency from 100 percent to 50 per-
cent and back to 100 percent to produce a particular effect. 
Gradients ordinarily proceed smoothly from one color to another. If you
want a less-homogeneous appearance, adjust the Smoothness slider to a
value of less than 100 percent (click the right-pointing arrow to access
the slider).

Managing and Saving Gradients
After taking the time to create custom gradients, store them so that you can
use or edit them again later. Before you save them, however, be sure to add
them to the gradient Presets. (See “Customizing and editing gradients” ear-
lier in this chapter.) Here are some tips for managing your gradients:
 To save your set of gradients, click the Save button in the Gradient
Editor dialog box. You save the current presets, including your new gra-
dient, under the current library’s name or another one that you choose.
 To load gradient presets into the Gradient Editor, click the Load button
and select the name of the gradient library that you want to add to the
Presets list.
 To add to the current presets, select the name of the new presets from
the Gradient Editor’s pop-up menu.
For more information about managing gradient presets with the Preset
Manager, see Book I, Chapter 4.
Working with Patterns
You may have spotted someone on the golf course with plaid shorts and a
striped polo shirt. If so, you’ve been introduced to the power of patterns.
Not always a pretty sight when used with abandon, patterns can be used to
fill selections or layers. You can also stamp your image with the Pattern
Stamp tool and retouch using a pattern with the Healing Brush tool.
Elements offers a lot of preset patterns to keep you happy. But, you can
create your own, of course.
You select patterns from panels that appear on the Options bar for many of
the tools just mentioned, just as you do with brush tips and gradients. You
also manage them in much the same way using the Preset Manager. The fol-
lowing sections show you how to apply a preset pattern and create your own.
Applying a preset pattern
Although you can apply patterns by using many different tools, this chapter
sticks with applying patterns as fills. To fill a layer or selection with a preset
pattern, follow these steps:
1. Choose the layer from the Layers panel and/or make the selection
you want to fill with a pattern.
We recommend making your selection on a new layer above the image
for more flexible editing later on.

2. Choose Edit➪Fill Selection or Fill Layer, and select Pattern from the
Use drop-down menu, as shown in Figure 2-10.
3. Click the down-pointing arrow next to the Custom Pattern swatch.
From the Custom Pattern drop-down palette, select your desired
pattern.
Figure 2-10: Fill the selection with one of the many other preset patterns.
4. Choose any other fill options you want to apply, such as Mode,
Opacity, or Preserve Transparency.
The Preserve Transparency option prevents Elements from filling the
transparent areas on your layer with a pattern. For details on the other
options, see the section “Filling a Selection with a Solid Color” earlier in
this chapter.
We recommend adjusting the Mode and Opacity settings in the Layers
panel rather than in the Fill dialog box. This approach allows you maxi-
mum flexibility if you want to make edits later.

5. Click OK to fill the layer or selection with the chosen pattern.
Here are a few other tips to remember when working with preset patterns:
• Replace the current patterns with new patterns by selecting Replace
Patterns from the palette pop-up menu. (Click the right-pointing
arrow on the right side of the palette.) Then, select the new pattern
library from the dialog box that appears.
• Append new patterns to the current set by selecting Load Patterns
from the palette pop-up menu.
• Append one of the preset libraries by selecting the library from the
list at the bottom of the palette pop-up menu.
Creating a new pattern
You can create your own pattern, basing it on an existing image or one you
create yourself. Select a small portion of an image to build an abstract pat-
tern or use a recognizable object to define that object as a pattern stamp.
You can use anything, from a logo to your signature, as a pattern.
To create your own pattern, follow these steps:
1. Open the image that contains the area you want to use as a pattern or
create an image from scratch.
2. Make any modifications to the image to produce the exact pattern
that you want.
3. Use the Rectangular Marquee tool to select the area you want to con-
vert into a pattern.
If you don’t make a selection, Elements uses your entire image as a
basis for the pattern.
If you’re using a selection to define your pattern, you must use a rectan-
gular selection. And, you can’t use a feathered selection of any kind.
4. Choose Edit➪Define Pattern from Selection or Edit➪Define Pattern.
5. Enter a name for your pattern in the Pattern Name dialog box.
Your new pattern appears in the Pattern panel for use.
In addition to filling your selection with a pattern, you can stamp on a pat-
tern with the Pattern Stamp tool. For details, see Book VIII, Chapter 1.

 Understanding type basics
 Getting to know the Type tools
 Entering and editing text
 Making type follow a path
 Using the Character and Paragraph panels
 Editing text
 Exploring masking, shaping, and warping effects
Yes, images are powerful. But so are words. In fact, humans tend to
remember images better when they are combined with words. This is
why we don’t recall our dreams that well — no words are paired with the
images. Enough psychobabble. You may never need to pick up a Type tool.
But, just in case you need to add a caption, headline, or short paragraph, we
want you to be comfortable using the Type tools. 
Elements allows you to create, edit, stylize, and even distort type. Keep in
mind that this capability is no substitute for a hard-core page
layout or word-processing program. But for small chunks of
text here and there, it is surprisingly effective. This chap-
ter is all about adding great-looking snippets of text to
great-looking images — an unbeatable combo. 
Understanding Type Modes
The text you create in Elements can be categorized
in several different ways, but ultimately, you’re
either adding just a little text (such as a word or
single line) or a lot (a paragraph or so). Accordingly,
Elements can create type in two modes:
 Point type: Use this mode to create a headline or label.
You can create point type by clicking in your image and
typing; the line appears while you type and grows to whatever
length you need. In fact, it even continues past the boundary of your
image! Point type never wraps around to a new line. To wrap to the next
line, you must press Enter (Return on the Mac).

Understanding Different Kinds of Type
302
 Paragraph type: Use this mode to enter longer blocks of text on an
image. It’s similar to the kind of type you’re accustomed to working
with in word-processing programs. In Paragraph Type mode, all the text
goes into a resizable bounding box; and if a line is too long, Photoshop
automatically wraps it around to the next line.
The Point Type and Paragraph Type modes each operate a bit differently,
although they share many features and options. We explain each of them
separately in the sections “Entering Point Type” and “Entering Paragraph
Type,” later in this chapter.
Understanding Different Kinds of Type
In addition to the two Type modes Elements offers (see point type and para-
graph type in the previous section), Elements is also capable of displaying
and printing type in two different formats. Each format has its pros and
cons, and which format you use depends on your needs. Here’s a descrip-
tion of each one:
 Vector type: All text in Elements is initially created as vector type.
Vector type provides scalable outlines that you can resize without pro-
ducing jagged edges in the diagonal strokes. You can edit type in this
mode, adding or subtracting characters or adjusting attributes, such as
kerning and tracking. Vector type is always of optimum quality and
appears crisp and clean. (See Book III, Chapter 1 for more details on
vector and rasterized images.)
 Raster type: When Elements converts vector type into pixels, that text
is rasterized. Elements refers to this rasterization process as simplify-
ing. When text is simplified, it’s no longer editable, but is converted into
a raster image. In essence, it’s a frozen graphic of the text. You usually
simplify a vector type when you want to apply filters to produce a spe-
cial effect or when you want to merge the type with the image. You can’t
resize simplified type without losing some quality or risking jagged
edges. For more details, see the section “Rasterizing Type Layers,” later
in this chapter.
Exploring the Type Tools
Elements has four Type tools (found in the Tools panel), but two of them
are simply vertically oriented versions of the main two text implements, as
shown in Figure 3-1. Don’t worry about the Vertical Type tools. Although
you can use them, they’re really designed for the Asian market, to enter
Chinese and Japanese characters. The Horizontal and Vertical Type tools
are identical in their attributes, so we cover only the two horizontal type

Entering Point Type
303
tools here; and for the sake of simplicity, we call them the Type tool and the
Type Mask tool. You can use either Paragraph or Point type mode with
either of the Type tools:
 Type tool: Use this tool to enter
point or paragraph type. This tool
creates the type on its own type
layer, except when used in Bitmap
or Indexed Color modes, neither
of which supports layers. For
more on layers, see Book VI. 
 Type Mask tool: This tool doesn’t
create actual type; instead, it cre-
ates a selection border in the shape of the type you want to enter. The
selection border is added to the active layer. You can do anything with a
type selection that you can do with any other selection. For details on
selections, see Book IV.
Entering Point Type 
Most of the type you add to Elements will probably consist of point type.
Point type is great for headlines, captions, labels, and similar small amounts
of text. You can also use it to create logos and headings for Web pages. Point
type is so called because it’s preceded by a single anchor point, which
marks the starting point of the line of type. Remember that point-type lines
don’t wrap automatically, as shown in Figure 3-2.
To enter point type, just follow these steps:
1. In the Editor, in Full Edit mode, open an image or create a new, blank
document (File➪New).
2. Select either the Horizontal Type tool from the Tools panel or press T
to select it, if it is visible.
If the Horizontal Type tool isn’t visible, press Shift+T to cycle through
the type tools. Your cursor looks like an I-beam, similar to the one you
see in a word-processing program.
3. Click the area of the image where you want to insert the text.
For horizontal type, a small horizontal line about one-third of the way
up the I-beam shows the location of the baseline (on which the line of
text rests). 
4. Specify your type options from the Options bar.
All the options are described in the upcoming section, “Using the
Options Bar.”

Figure 3-1: Elements offers four Type
tools.

Entering Paragraph Type

5. Type your text. Press Enter (or Return on the Mac) to begin a new
line.
When you press Enter or Return, you insert a hard return that doesn’t
move. You have to remove hard returns if you want to change the
length of the lines you type.
6. When you finish entering the text, click the Commit (the check mark
icon) button on the Options bar.
You can also commit the type by pressing Enter on the numeric keypad
or by clicking any other tool on the Tools panel. A new type layer con-
taining your text — indicated by the T icon — is created and appears in
your Layers panel.
Figure 3-2: Point type doesn’t automatically wrap, but can actually 
run off your image.
Entering Paragraph Type 
If you have larger chunks of text, it’s more practical to enter the text as
paragraph type. Paragraph type is similar to the text you enter in a word-
processing program, except that it’s contained inside a text box or a bound-
ing box. While you type into a text box, the lines of text wrap around to fit
the dimensions of the box. If you resize the box, Elements adjusts the
wrapped ends to account for the new size.
You can type multiple paragraphs, use typographical controls, and rotate or
scale the type. You can easily resize paragraph type (and point type, too) by
entering a new point size value in the Options bar without having to reselect
all the text. Just make sure the text layer is selected in the Layers panel and
the Text tool is active. This approach works for all the other text character-
istics, as well.
To enter paragraph type, follow these steps:
1. Open a saved image or create a new, blank Elements document in the
Editor in Full Edit mode.
2. Select either the Horizontal Type tool from the Tools panel or press T
to select it, if it is visible.

Entering Paragraph Type
305
If it isn’t visible, press Shift T to cycle through the type tools. 
Your cursor looks like an I-beam, similar to the one you see in a word-
processing program.
3. On the image, insert and size the text box by using one of the follow-
ing methods:
• Drag to create a text box close to the size you want. After you release
the mouse button, you can drag any of the handles at the corners
and sides of the box to resize the box.
• Hold down the Alt (Option on the Mac) key and click the image. The
Paragraph Text Size dialog box appears. Enter the exact dimensions
of a bounding box. When you click OK, the specified box appears,
complete with handles for resizing the box later.
4. Select Type options from the Options bar.
Options are described in detail in the upcoming section, “Using the
Options Bar.”
5. Enter the text. To start a new paragraph, press Enter (Return on the Mac).
Each line wraps around to fit inside the bounding box, as you can see in
Figure 3-3.
If you type more text than fits in the text box, an overflow icon (plus
sign) appears in the bottom right handle. You can resize the text box by
dragging any of the bounding box handles.
Figure 3-3: Paragraph text automatically wraps to conform to 
the bounding box.

6. Click the Commit button (check mark icon) on the Options bar (or
press Enter on the numeric keypad).
Elements creates a new type layer, as indicated by the T icon displayed
in the Layers panel.
Using the Options Bar
Several character and paragraph type settings are located on the Options
bar, as shown in Figure 3-4. These options enable you to specify the type
and pair it with your images.
Figure 3-4: The Type options on the Options bar.
Here is an explanation of each option, from left to right:
 Font Family: Select the font/typeface you want from the drop-down list.
Elements provides you with a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You
Get) font menu. After the font name, the word sample is rendered in the
actual font. You also find one of these abbreviations before the font
name to let you know what type of font it is: 
• a: Adobe Type 1 (PostScript) fonts
• TT: TrueType fonts
• O: OpenType fonts
Fonts with no abbreviation are bitmapped fonts.
 Font Style: Some font families have additional styles, such as light or
semibold. And other styles are assigned as separate typefaces. Only the
styles available for a particular font appear in the list. The font style
also supports a WYSIWYG menu.
If a font you want to use doesn’t offer bold or italic styles, you can simu-
late either or both by selecting a faux style.
 Font Size: Select your type size from the drop-down list or just type a
size in the text box. Generally, text sizes are shown in points, with 72
points equaling approximately 1 inch. 
If you don’t like points, you can switch to millimeters or pixels by
choosing Edit➪Preferences➪Units and Rulers (or Elements➪
Preferences➪Units and Rulers).

Using the Options Bar
307
 Anti-Aliasing: Select Anti-
Aliasing to slightly smooth out
the edges of your text. Anti-
aliasing softens that edge by 
1 pixel, as shown in Figure 3-5.
For the most part, you want to
keep this option turned on. The
one occasion when you may
want it turned off is if you’re
creating small type to be dis-
played onscreen, such as on
Web pages. The soft edges can
sometimes be tough to read
easily.
 Faux Bold: Use this option to create a fake bold style when a real bold
style (which you’d choose under Font Style) doesn’t exist. Be aware that
applying faux styles can distort the proportions of a font. You should try
to use fonts with real styles, and if they don’t exist — oh, well.
 Faux Italic: This option creates a phony italic style and carries the same
warning as the Faux Bold option.
 Underline: This setting obviously underlines your type, like this.
 Strikethrough: Choose this option to apply a strikethrough style to
your text. In legal applications, strikethrough is widely used to show
sections that have been removed, in their original context.
 Text Alignment: From the text alignment drop-down menu, choose an
option to align horizontal text on the left, center, or right. Left-aligned
text is even with the left margin and allowed to be ragged on the right
side of the column. Centered text is evenly centered in its column and
ragged on both right and left edges. Right-aligned text is even with the
right margin and allowed to be ragged on the left side.
If you happen to have vertical text, these options rotate 90 degrees
clockwise and change into top, bottom, and center vertical settings.
 Leading: Leading (pronounced “ledding”) is the amount of space
between the baselines of lines of type, usually measured in points. The
baseline is the imaginary line on which a line of type rests. You can
select a specific amount of leading or allow Elements to determine the
amount automatically by choosing Auto. When you select Auto Leading,
Elements multiplies the type size by a value of 120 percent to calculate
the leading size. Therefore, Elements spaces the baselines of 10-point
type 12 points apart. Elements adds that extra 20 percent so that the
bottoms of the lowest letters don’t “hook” onto the tops of the tallest
letters on the line below them.

Editing Text
308
Wider line spacing can make text easier to read (as long as you don’t go
overboard!) or can be used for artistic effect. Tighter line spacing makes for
more compact text but can decrease readability if the tightening goes too far.
 Text Color: Click the color swatch to select a color for your type from
the Color Picker. You can also choose a color from the Swatches panel.
 Create Warped Text: This option lets you warp and bend text by using
15 different types of distortion.
 Change the Text Orientation: Select your type layer in the Layers panel
and then click this option to switch between vertical and horizontal
type orientations.
 Cancel: Click this button (or press the Esc key) to cancel the text entry
you’re making. Use this option or the Commit option only after you
click the Type tool on your canvas.
 Commit: Click this button to apply the text to a type layer.
Editing Text
You can apply all the options described in this chapter while you enter text,
or later, when you’re rearranging words or fixing typos and other errors. To
make changes to the text itself, just follow these steps:
1. Open your image in the Editor in Full Edit mode. 
2. Select the Type tool from the Tools panel.
3. In the Layers panel, select the existing type layer you want to modify.
Or click within the text to automatically select the type layer.
Double-click the T icon in the Layers panel to simultaneously select all
of the text on that layer and activate your Type tool.
4. After selecting your desired text, use the Options bar to make your
changes: 
• Change the font family, size, color, or other type option: If you want to
change all the text, simply select that type layer on the Layers panel.
To select only portions of the text, highlight the text by dragging
across it with the I-beam of the Type tool, as shown in Figure 3-6.
• Delete text: Highlight the text by dragging across it with the I-beam
of the Type tool. Then press the Backspace key (Delete on the Mac).
• Add text: Make an insertion point by clicking the I-beam within the
line of text. Then, type new text.

Rasterizing the Type Layer
309
5. When you’re done modifying the text, click the Commit button.
Figure 3-6: Highlight selected text to modify attributes.
Occasionally, you may want to transform your text. To do so, make sure 
that the type layer is selected on the Layers panel. Then, choose Image➪
Transform➪Free Transform. Grab a handle on the bounding box and drag to
rotate or scale. Press Ctrl (Ô on the Mac) and drag a handle to distort.
When you’re done, double-click inside the bounding box to commit the
transformation. For more details on transformations, see Book VI, Chapter 2.
Rasterizing the Type Layer
The Type tool creates editable type layers. You can change the wording,
spacing, font, font size, and other factors as much as you want, as long as the
type remains in a type layer, which retains the vector format. (See the section
“Understanding Different Kinds of Type,” earlier in this chapter for details.)
However, after you make all the changes you want, you may need to convert
your vector type layer to pixels in the form of rasterized type. In Elements,
this rasterization process is referred to as simplifying. After the type is simpli-
fied, you can apply filters, paint on the type, and apply gradients and patterns. 
If you’re working with layers and flatten your image (merge your layers into
a single background image), the type layers are also simplified and merged
with the other pixels in the image. By the way, if you try to apply a filter to a
vector type layer, Elements barks at you that the type layer must be simpli-
fied before proceeding and gives you the opportunity to click OK (if you
want to simplify) or Cancel.
To simplify your type, select the type layer on the Layers panel and choose
Layer➪Simplify Layer. Your type layer is then converted (the T icon disap-
pears) into a regular layer on which your type is now displayed as pixels
against a transparent background, as shown in Figure 3-7.
After you simplify your type, you can no longer edit the type, nor can you
resize the text without risking jaggies. Simplify your type only when you’re
certain you won’t need to edit or resize it anymore. Another thing to remem-
ber about simplified type is that although it looks identical to vector type
onscreen, it may not print as crisply and cleanly as vector type. So, if you’re
Book V

experimenting with painting or filters
on type, just make a duplicate of the
type layer before simplifying it and
then hide that layer in the Layers
panel. For details on working with
Layers, see Book VI.
Masking with Type
In addition to its Vertical and
Horizontal Type tools that we have
been discussing up to this point,
Elements includes Vertical and
Horizontal Type Mask tools. These
tools function almost identically to
their conventional counterparts, with
one important exception: Type mask
tools don’t create a new layer. Instead,
they create a selection on the active
layer, like the one shown in Figure 3-8.

Figure 3-7: Simplifying your type layer

You can treat the selections created with the Type Mask tools just as you
would any other selection. Try the following:
 Move type mask selections around your document when any of the
selection tools are active.
 Store type mask selections for later use by choosing Select➪
Save Selection. See Book IV for details on selections.
 Use the selection to cut or copy portions of an image in text-shaped
chunks, as shown in Figure 3-9. You can find out how this last technique
works by following the steps in the Putting It Together project “Carving
Your Type out of Stone,” coming up next, in which you find out how to
literally carve your words in stone.
 On a separate layer, fill the selection with a Foreground to Transparent
gradient to have your type gradually fade out over the image, as shown
in Figure 3-10. For details on gradients, see Book V, Chapter 2.

Putting It Together
Carving Your Type out of Stone
You can use a Type tool to create selections shaped like text and then use images them-
selves as fills for the type. For example, if you’re creating a floral-themed Web page, you
can use pictures of flowers as the fill for the text. A type selection can cut out any part of
a picture for use any way you want.
Follow these steps to create letters made from stone:
1. In the Editor, in Full Edit mode, open the stone texture image you want to use.
We’re using a sandstone wall, but you can use other kinds of stone, wood, or any
texture that interests you. 
2. Convert your background into a layer by double-clicking the word Background on
the Layers panel and then click OK.
This step enables you to stylize the type later on.
3. Select the Horizontal Type Mask tool from the Tools panel and then click the area
where you want to enter text.
4. Select the font, font style, font size, and other text attributes from the drop-down
lists on the Options bar.
5. Click the image and type the text. Then, click the Commit button (the check mark
icon) on the Options bar.
A selection border in the shape of the text appears on your image.
6. Choose Select➪Inverse, which deselects letter selections and selects everything
else.
7. Press the Backspace (delete on the Mac) key to delete everything outside your
selection border. Choose Select➪Deselect.
Your type is now filled with your stone texture.
Stylizing and Warping Type
You can do a lot more with type than create conventional labels, captions,
or paragraphs of text. Type can become an interesting part of your image,
especially when you stylize, warp, or otherwise transform it in interesting
ways. Your Elements text can help enhance the impact of your image. The
text of a beach scene can appear to be wavy, or watery and translucent.
Halloween type can take on a ghostly or spooky appearance. Text on a wed-
ding photo can be elegant and romantic. It all depends on how you create
and apply various effects.

Stylizing and Warping Type
314
The following sections show you some of the tricks you can perform by styl-
izing and warping your type so that your words come to life and add some-
thing special to your images.
Playing with type opacity
Layers are a digital version of the old analog transparency, or acetate, sheets.
(Check out Book VI, Chapter 1 for the scoop on layers.) You can change the
transparency of a Type layer — just as you can with any other layer in
Elements — by reducing the opacity (transparency) of the type so that it
enables the underlying layer to show through. Take a peek at Figure 3-11,
which shows type at varying levels of opacity over an image.
Corbis Digital Stock
Figure 3-11: Varying the opacity of type allows the underlying 
image to show through.
The upcoming Putting It Together project, “Ghosting Your Type,” shows you
a way to use type opacity to create a ghostly effect.

Putting It Together
Ghosting Your Type
Need some ghostly, semitransparent type? Using Elements, you can twist, transmo-
grify, and transform your text. Create your type from scratch in an empty document or
add the type to an existing picture or background. Just for the heck of it, these steps
show you how to add ghostly writing to an existing image:
1. Open the image you want to use as
a background for the ghost type.
Any image, ectoplasmic or not, 
will do.
2. Click on the Foreground color
swatch in the Tools panel and
select the color you want to use
for your text from the Color Picker.
For info on using the Color Picker,
see Book III, Chapter 4. Black and
orange are good Halloween colors,
but you can use any contrasting
colors.
You can also sample a color
directly from your image by using
the Eyedropper 
tool. Simply click your desired
color, and it then becomes your
new foreground 
color.
3. Select the Horizontal Type tool
from the Tools panel and then click the area where you want to add the text.
The vertical cursor that appears is the size that the text will be.
4. Select a font, style, and size from the drop-down lists on the Options bar.

8. To change the
opacity of the type,
adjust the Opacity
setting of the Type
layer in the Layers
panel.
To make additional
changes to the
text, you can apply
a filter. For exam-
ple, if you want to
make the text
wavy, select the
Wave filter in the
Filter➪Distort
menu. Or you can use other filters from the array discussed in Book VII, Chapter 1.
Just remember, when you use a filter, a warning pops up informing you that the type
layer must be simplified (converted from editable text to pixels) first. Click OK and
then apply the filter.
9. When you’re satisfied with the look, save your image for additional editing later or
choose Layer➪Flatten Image to combine the text and background.

with Type
Applying filters to type
One of the most interesting things you can do with type in Elements that you
can’t do in a word-processing or page-layout program is apply special
effects, such as filters. You can make type look as if it’s underwater or on the
move, as shown in Figure 3-12, where we applied a motion blur. The only
caveat is that type has to be simplified before a filter can be applied. Be sure
to do all your text editing before you get to the filtering stage. Applying the
filter is as easy as selecting the simplified type layer on the Layers panel and
choosing a filter from the Filter menu. For more on filters, see Book VII,
Chapter 1.
Painting over type with color
Changing the color of text is as easy as highlighting it and selecting a color
from the Color Picker. But what if you want to do something a little more
unconventional, such as apply brush strokes of paint randomly across the
type as we did in the first image shown in Figure 3-13. It’s really easier than it
looks. Again, as with applying filters to text, the only criterion is that the
type has to be simplified first. After that’s done, select a color, grab the
Brush tool with settings of your choice, and paint. In our example, we used a
rough, dry brush found in the Brushes presets. We used a diameter of 39, 15,
and 6 pixels and just clicked the type a few times.

Stylizing and Warping Type
318
If you want the color or gradient to be
confined to only the type area, you can
select the text by either Ctrl-clicking
(Ô-clicking on the Mac) the layer 
containing the text or locking the
transparency of the layer on the
Layers panel.
You can also apply a gradient to your
type. Here are the steps to follow after
simplifying your type:
1. In the Editor in Full Edit mode,
select the Gradient tool from the
Tools panel.
2. On the Options bar, click the
down-pointing arrow next to the Gradient Picker to access the
Gradient Picker drop-down panel.
3. Choose a gradient.
If you want to create a custom gradient, find out how in Book V, 
Chapter 2.
4. Position the gradient cursor on the text where you want the gradient
to start and drag to where you want the gradient to end.
If you’re not happy, drag again until you get the look you want.
Remember that you can drag at any angle and to any length, even out-
side your type. In the second image shown in Figure 3-13, we used the
copper gradient and just dragged from the top of the letters to the
bottom. We also locked the transparent pixels on the layer to confine
the gradient to just the type area.
Warping your type
Element’s great automated Warp feature can twist your type in a variety of
ways (see Figure 3-14) that are not only repeatable but, thanks to the con-
trols in their dialog boxes, also customizable. The cool part is that even
though type has been warped, it remains fully editable until you simplify it. 
Type warping is fun and easy to do. Select the Type tool in the Tools panel
and then click the Create Warped Text button at the far-right end of the
Options bar. (It’s the T with a curved line below it.) This action opens the
Warp Text dialog box, where you find a vast array of distortions on the Style
pop-up menu with descriptive names such as Bulge, Inflate, and Squeeze.
You can adjust the orientation, amount of bend, and degree of distortion by
Figure 3-13: Add visual interest to type
with color (top) or a gradient (bottom).

Stylizing and Warping Type
319
dragging the sliders. The Bend setting affects the amount of warp, and the
Horizontal and Vertical Distortions apply perspective to that warp. Luckily,
you can preview the results while you adjust. We could give you technical
explanations of these adjustments, but the best way to see what they do is
to just play with them. Figure 3-14 shows some of the warp styles. The
names speak for themselves.
Figure 3-14: Choose from a number of warp styles.
Web designers take note: You can’t warp text that has a faux bold style
applied.

Working with
Layers and
Masks

A
fter you master creating selections, you’ll
want to do something with the selections
you create. This is where Book VI helps you. We
talk about creating selection masks, reusing selec-
tions, adding layers to a document and creating
layers from selections, and all the masking options
you have in Full Edit mode. Next to mastering
selections, understanding layers and how to use
them is one of the most important aspects of
working in Elements.

U
sing Elements without the assistance of layers would be like trying to
wash your car with a toothbrush and a pail of water, instead of a hose
and a power-scrubber brush. Yes, it can be done. But it takes a lot longer
and is downright tedious. The benefit to using layers is that you have
tremendous flexibility. You can make endless edits as long as those layers
exist. You can rearrange their order, and if you decide you don’t want them
anymore, you simply delete them. Layers make working in Elements a lot
more forgiving, allowing you to make changes quickly and productively.
But hey, it’s not just the technical and practical aspects that
make layers so awesome. Layers also allow you to express
your creative side, allowing you to composite several
images into one with just a drag of the mouse. This
chapter gives you the basics on working with layers.
Chapter 2 of this book fills in the rest of the details.
After you give layers a try, you’ll find that they
make your image-editing life so much easier. Now,
only if they would go out and wash the car.
Getting Familiar with Layers
In terms of a real-world analogy, think of layers as sheets
of acetate or transparency film, similar to those clear plastic
sheets used with overhead projectors. You have drawings,
photos, or type on the individual sheets. What you place on one sheet
doesn’t affect the other sheets. You can show just one sheet, or you can

Getting Familiar with Layers
324
stack several on top of one another to create a combination image or com-
posite (or collage). You can reshuffle the order of the sheets, add new
sheets, or delete sheets. Any space on the sheet that doesn’t have an image,
drawing, or type on it is transparent.
That’s how layers work in Elements. You can place elements on separate
layers, yet show them together to create a composite. You can also add,
delete, or rearrange layers. And unlike using real sheets of acetate, you can
adjust how opaque or transparent (referred to as opacity) the element on
the layer is. You can also change the way the colors between layers interact
by using Blend Modes. Opacity and Blend Modes are both covered in
Chapter 3 of this Book.
When you create a new image with a white or colored background, scan an
image into Elements, or open a file from a CD or your digital camera, you
basically have a file with just a background. There are no layers yet.
At this basic level, an image contains only the one background, and you 
can’t do much to it besides paint on it and make basic adjustments. You can’t
rearrange the background in the stack of layers (once you have some) — it’s
always on the very bottom of the Layers panel. You also can’t change the
opacity or blend mode of a background. What you can do is convert a back-
ground to a layer, making it possible to rearrange, change opacity, and blend
modes.
Keep in mind that to work with layers, you must be in the Editor in Full Edit
mode.
To convert a background into a layer, follow these steps:
1. In the Editor, in Full Edit mode, choose Window➪Layers to display
the Layers panel.
The Layers panel is explained in the upcoming section, “Getting to
Know the Layers panel.”
2. Double-click Background in the Layers panel.
You can also choose Layer➪New➪Layer from Background. Note that
the name Background is italicized in the Layers panel, as shown in
Figure 1-1.
The New Layer dialog box appears.

Getting Familiar with Layers
325
Purestock
Figure 1-1: A newly opened image in Elements contains only a background.
3. Name the layer or leave it at the
default name of Layer 0.
Note that you can also adjust the
blend mode and opacity of the
layer in the New Layer dialog box.
It is better to do so via the Layers
panel commands. We cover these
techniques in Chapter 3 of this
Book.
4. Click OK.
Elements converts your background
into a layer, also known as an image
layer. Note that the layer name is
no longer italicized, as shown in
Figure 1-2.
When you create a new image with transparent contents for the background,
the image doesn’t contain a background but instead is created with a single
layer. If you so desire, you can convert a layer into a background by select-
ing it and then choosing Layer➪New➪Background from Layer. Note that this
option is available only when no background exists.

Introducing Different Types of Layers
326
Introducing Different Types of Layers
Although turning the background into a layer (discussed in the preceding
section) is a popular activity, Elements refers to layers in the plural for a
reason. You’ll probably be creating image layers most of the time, but other
types exist. Elements actually offers five types of layers. Some you may
never use, and some you may use only occasionally, but it’s good to be
familiar with them all.
Working with image layers
The image layer is the one that most closely matches the acetate analogy
(discussed in the section “Getting Familiar with Layers,” earlier in this chap-
ter). You put various elements on separate layers to create a composite
image. You can create blank layers and add images to them, or you can
create layers from images themselves. You can create as many layers as
your computer’s memory allows.
Each layer in an image is a separate entity. This enables you to edit, paint,
transform, mask (described in Chapter 4 of this Book), or apply a filter to a
layer without affecting the other layers or the background. And after an ele-
ment is on a layer, you no longer have to make a selection (see Book IV for
details on selections) to select it. Just drag the element with the Move tool.
The element freely floats in a sea of transparency.
Because showing clear areas or transparency is impossible on a computer
monitor, Elements uses a gray-and-white checkerboard, by default, to repre-
sent the transparent areas of a layer.
Using adjustment layers
An adjustment layer is a special kind of layer used mostly for color and con-
trast correction. What’s great about adjustment layers is that you can apply
those corrections without permanently affecting any of the pixels on your
layers. Adjustment layers are totally nondestructive. They apply the correc-
tion to all the layers below them, without affecting any of the layers above
them.
Because the adjustment actually resides on a layer, you can edit, delete,
duplicate, merge, or rearrange the adjustment layer at any time. You have
more flexibility in your image-editing chores and more freedom for experi-
mentation. In addition, none of this experimentation harms your image
because it takes place above the image on an adjustment layer.

Introducing Different Types of Layers
327
Another unique feature of adjustment
layers is that when you create one, you
also create a layer mask on that layer.
A layer mask is like a second sheet of
acetate that hovers over the underly-
ing layers. The layer mask allows you
to selectively apply the adjustment to
the layers below it by applying shades
of gray — from white to black — on the
mask. For example, by default, the
mask is completely white. This allows
the adjustment to be fully applied to
the layers. If you paint on a layer mask
with black, as shown in Figure 1-3, the
areas under those black areas don’t
show the adjustment. If you paint with
a shade of gray, those areas partially show the adjustment. The darker the
shade of gray, the less these areas show the adjustment. Note that if you
have an active selection border in your image before you add an adjustment
layer, the adjustment is applied only to the area within the selection border.
The resulting layer mask also reflects that selection: The selected areas are
white, and the unselected areas are black.
You can also use the layer mask to creatively blend two layers. Be sure to
see Chapter 4 of this Book to find out how. It is definitely worth your while. 
Elements has eight kinds of adjustment layers, and you can use as many as
your heart desires. The adjustments offered are the same adjustments you
find on the Enhance➪Adjust Lighting and Enhance➪Adjust Color submenus.
For specifics on each adjustment and what it corrects, see Book VIII,
Chapters 1 and 2. Here’s how to create an adjustment layer:
1. In the Editor, in Full Edit mode, open an image of your choice.
Because you’re applying an adjustment layer, you may want to use an
image that’s in need of some color adjustment. Note that with adjust-
ment layers, you don’t need to convert your background into a layer.
2. Click the Create Adjustment Layer icon in the Layers panel.
The Adjustment Layer drop-down list appears.
Note that you can also choose Layer➪New Adjustment Layer and then
choose your desired adjustment layer from the submenu. Name the
layer, leave the other options at their defaults, and click OK.
3. From the drop-down list, choose your desired adjustment.
The dialog box pertaining to your adjustment appears. 
Book VI

an Adjustment Layer.

4. Make the necessary adjustments and click OK.
The adjustment layer appears in the Layers panel, shown in Figure 1-4.
The Adjustment Layer icon (sporting a few gears) and a thumbnail (rep-
resenting a layer mask) appear on the adjustment layer. 
Figure 1-4: Applying your corrections with an adjustment layer, rather 
than directly on the image, allows for more editing flexibility.
In our example, the layer mask of our Levels adjustment layer — the central
layer of the three-layer sandwich — is all white, so the adjustment shows up
full strength over the image. Note that you can paint on the layer mask to
selectively allow only portions of your image to receive the adjustment, as
shown in our Hue/Saturation adjustment layer. Use the Brush or Pencil tool
to paint. Or, you can also make a selection and fill that selection with any
shade of gray, from white to black. Finally, you can use the Gradient tool on
the mask to create a gradual application of the adjustment. 
You can also adjust the opacity and blend modes of an adjustment layer,
just as with image layers. Reducing the opacity of an adjustment layer
reduces the effect of the adjustment on the underlying layers.

Viewing and deleting adjustment layers
If you want to view your image without the adjustment, click the Eye icon in
the left column of the Layers panel to hide the adjustment layer. If you want
to delete the adjustment layer, simply drag it to the Trash icon in the Layers
panel, or choose Delete➪Layer from the Layer menu or the Layers panel
options menu (click More in the top right of the panel to access the menu).
Editing adjustment layers
After you create an adjustment layer, you can easily edit it. Simply double-
click the Adjustment Layer icon in the Layers panel. You can also choose
Layer➪Layer Content Options. In the adjustment’s dialog box, make any
edits and then click OK. The only adjustment layer that you can’t edit is the
Invert adjustment. It’s either totally on or totally off.
Switching adjustment layers
To switch to a different type of adjustment layer, choose Layer➪
Change Layer Content and choose a different adjustment layer from the 
submenu.
Isolating your adjustments
If you don’t use an adjustment layer when you make color corrections, the
correction you apply affects only the active layer (the layer highlighted in
the Layers panel). The correction does not affect all the layers below, as it
would if you used an adjustment layer. But you can also isolate your adjust-
ment layer to a single layer or a portion of a single layer.
Here are some tips for using and isolating adjustment layers:
 Correct part (but not all) of a layer. To enable the adjustment layer to
correct only a portion of a layer, make a selection before you create the
adjustment layer. The adjustment affects only the pixels within the
selection outline. The adjustment affects the pixels within the selection
outline on each layer that resides below the adjustment layer. 
Another way to correct part of a layer is to paint on the adjustment
layer mask. Painting with black hides the adjustment, and painting with
various levels of gray partially hides the adjustment. For more on
masks, see Chapter 4 of this Book.
 Clip to the layer. If you want the adjustment layer to affect only the
immediate underlying layer and not those below that immediate layer,
you can create a clipping group. To do so, press the Alt (Option on the
Mac) and click the line between the adjustment layer and your immedi-
ate, underlying image layer. For details on clipping groups, see Chapter 4
of this Book.

Taking advantage of fill layers
A fill layer lets you add a layer of solid color, a gradient, or a pattern. Like
adjustment layers, fill layers also have layer masks, as indicated by the
Mask icon thumbnail in the Layers panel.
Just as with image layers and adjustment layers, you can create as many fill
layers as you want. You can also edit, rearrange, duplicate, delete, and
merge fill layers. And you can blend fill layers with other layers by using the
opacity and blend mode options in the Layers panel.
You can confine the effects of a fill layer, as you can with an adjustment
layer, to a portion of the image. Make a selection before you create the fill
layer (see Book IV for more on selections) or paint on the mask later
(described in the earlier section, “Isolating your adjustments”). Editing or
changing the contents of a fill layer is similar to editing or changing the con-
tents of an adjustment layer (see “Switching adjustment layers”). To edit a
fill layer, double-click on the Fill Layer thumbnail in the Layers panel.
Here’s how to create a fill layer:
1. In the Editor, in Full Edit mode, open an image of your choice.
In this case, open an image that would look good with a frame, border,
or even type. Note that if you don’t have an active selection, the fill
layer encompasses your entire layer.
2. Click the Create Adjustment Layer icon on the Layers panel. From the
drop-down list, choose a fill of a solid color, gradient, or pattern.
Note that you can also choose Layer➪New Fill Layer and then choose
your desired fill layer from the submenu. In the New Layer dialog box,
name the layer, leave the other options at their defaults, and click OK. It
is better to specify options like Mode and Opacity within your Layers
panel, where you have more editing flexibility.
The dialog box specific to your type of fill appears.
3. Specify your options, depending on the fill type you chose in Step 2:
• Solid Color: Select your desired color from the Color Picker. (For
more on color, see Book III, Chapter 4.)
• Gradient: Click the down-pointing arrow to choose a preset gradient
from the drop-down panel or click the Gradient preview to display
the Gradient Editor and create your own gradient. For details on gra-
dients, see Book V, Chapter 2. 

Introducing Different Types of Layers
331
• Pattern: Select a pattern from the drop-down panel, as shown in
Figure 1-5. Choose a value from the Scale drop-down menu if you
want. Click Snap to Origin to make the origin of the pattern the same
as the origin of the document. Select the Link with Layer option to
specify that the pattern moves with the fill layer if you move the
layer.
Figure 1-5: Choose from a variety of preset patterns for your fill layer.
4. Click OK.
The fill layer appears in the Layers panel. Similar to what happens in
adjustment layers, a layer mask is created on the fill layer. In our exam-
ple, in Figure 1-6, the words Dolphin Sanctuary appear white on the layer
mask, thereby allowing our pattern to show through. The remaining
areas are black, hiding our pattern. We also added some layer styles
(bevel and drop shadow) to jazz up our type. For more on layer styles,
see Book VII, Chapter 3. 
If you want to delete the fill layer, do one of three things: First, select the
layer in the Layers panel and then drag it to the Trash icon in the Layers
panel; or choose Delete➪Layer from the Layer menu; or choose Delete
Layer from the Layers panel options menu.

Figure 1-6: Your chosen fill shows through your selected areas.
One final note: You can simplify a fill layer to convert it to a regular image
layer. Choose Layer➪Simplify. By doing so, you can use painting tools or 
filters on that layer. For more on simplifying layers, see Chapter 2 of this 
mini-book.
Making use of shape layers
Believe or not, Elements isn’t just about photos and painting. It also has a
set of shape-drawing tools — six, to be exact. You can fill those shapes with
solid color, gradients, or patterns. When you create a shape, you are creat-
ing a vector-based object. This term means that the shapes are defined by
mathematical equations, which create points and paths, rather than by
pixels. The advantage of vector-based objects is that you can freely size
these objects without causing degradation. In addition, they’re always
printed with smooth edges, not with the jaggies you’re familiar with seeing
in pixel-based elements.
To create a shape layer, grab a shape tool from the Tools panel and drag it
on your canvas. When you create a shape, it resides on its own, unique
shape layer, as shown in Figure 1-7. Although you can move and transform
shapes and adjust the blend modes and opacity, your ability to edit shape
layers is limited. To apply filters and other special effects, you must first
simplify the shape layers — that is, convert the vector paths to pixels. For
more on shapes, see Book V, Chapter 1.

Introducing Different Types of Layers
333
Figure 1-7: A shape layer is a vector-based object.
Using type layers
To create type, such as the type shown in Figure 1-8, click your canvas with
the Type tool and type your desired text. After you commit your text by 
pressing Enter on the numeric keypad or clicking the Commit button on the
Options bar (Check Mark icon), you’ve created a type layer. In the Layers
panel, you see a layer with a T icon, indicating that it’s a type layer. Initially,
the name of the type layer corresponds to the text you typed (you can change
the layer name, if you want). Like shapes, the text in Elements is vector-based
type and, if left in that format, always prints smooth and without the jaggies.
For more information on vector images, see Book III, Chapter 1.
Another great thing about type in Elements is that it’s live; you can edit the
text at any time. Besides changing the font and size, you can also change the
orientation, apply anti-aliasing (softening of the edges), and even warp it
into various distortions. You can transform, move, rearrange, copy, and
change the layer options (opacity, fill, and mode) of a type layer just as you
can for an image layers. If, however, you want to apply filters, you must first
simplify (convert into pixels) the text. For everything you need to know
about type, see Book V, Chapter 3.

Getting to Know the Layers Panel
Just like every other important aspect of Elements, layers are controlled in
their very own panel. You’ve seen bits and pieces of the Layers panel
throughout this chapter, but now it’s time for a full-blown discussion of its
capabilities. To display the Layers panel, shown in Figure 1-9, choose
Window➪Layers in the Editor, in Full Edit mode.
The order of the layers in the Layers panel represents the order in the
image. We refer to this concept as the stacking order. The top layer in the
panel is the top layer in your image, and so on.
For some tasks, you can work on only one layer at a time. For other tasks,
you can work on multiple layers simultaneously.
Figure 1-9: The Layers panel is control central for your layers.

Getting to Know the Layers Panel
335
Here’s the lowdown on how to work with the Layers panel:
 Select a layer. Click a layer name or thumbnail. Elements then high-
lights the active layer in the panel.
 Select multiple contiguous layers. Click your first layer and then Shift-
click your last layer.
 Select multiple noncontiguous layers. Ctrl-click (Ô-click on the Mac)
your desired layers.
Only layers that are visible are printed. This can be useful if you want to
have several versions of an image (each on a separate layer) for a proj-
ect within the same file.
 Select the actual element (the nontransparent pixels) on the layer.
Ctrl-click (Ô-click on the Mac) the layer’s thumbnail in the panel. 
 Create a new blank layer. Click the Create New Layer icon (a dog-eared
page) at the top of the panel.
 Create an adjustment or fill layer. Click the Create Adjustment Layer
icon (black and white circle) at the top of the panel. See the sections
“Using adjustment layers” and “Taking advantage of fill layers” (earlier
in this chapter) for more on these types of layers.
 Duplicate an existing layer. Drag the layer to the Create New Layer icon
at the top of the panel. 
 Rename a layer. When you create a new layer, Elements provides
default layer names (Layer 1, Layer 2, and so on). If you want to rename
a layer, double-click the layer name (the name, not the thumbnail) in the
Layers panel, enter the name directly in the Layers panel, and press
Enter (Return on the Mac). Although it may seem tedious to give your
layers meaningful names, it can help your productivity, especially when
the number of layers in your file starts to increase.
 Adjust the interaction between colors on layers and adjust the trans-
parency of layers. You can use the Blend Modes and the Opacity drop-
down menus at the top of the panel to mix the colors between layers
and adjust the transparency of the layers. (Take a look at Figure 1-10,
where we set the opacity at 30% and chose Lighten from the Blend
Mode drop-down menu.) For details, see Chapter 3 of this Book.
 Delete a layer. Drag it to the Trash icon at the bottom of the Layers
panel. You can also choose Layer➪Delete➪Layer or choose Delete Layer
from the panel options menu. 
The remaining icons at the top of the Layers panel allow you to link layers
and lock layers. Both these actions warrant sections of their own. In addi-
tion, you can also view and hide layers, rearrange, merge, and flatten layers.
See Chapter 2 of this Book for more details on all these features.

Using the Layer and Select Menus
As with many features in Elements, you usually have more than one way 
to do something. This is especially true when it comes to working with
layers. Besides the commands on the Layers panel itself, you have two 
layer menus — the Layer menu and the Select menu — both of which you
can find on the main Menu bar at the top of the Application window.
The Layer menu
Much of what you can do with the Layers panel icons, you can also do by
using the Layer menu on the Menu bar and the Layers panel pop-up menu
(click the More button in the upper-right corner to call up that one).
Commands, such as New, Duplicate, Delete, and Rename are omnipresent
throughout. But you also find commands that are exclusive to the panel, the
main Layer menu, and the Layers pop-up menu. So, if you can’t find what
you’re looking for in one area, just go to another. Some commands require
an expanded explanation and are described in other sections of this and
other books. Here’s a quick description of most of the commands:

Using the Layer and Select Menus
337
 Delete Linked Layers and Delete Hidden Layers: These commands
delete only those layers that have been linked or hidden from display
on the Layers panel.
 Layer Style: These commands manage the styles or special effects you
apply to your layers. Find more on layer styles and effects in Book VII,
Chapter 3.
 Change Layer Content: Depending on the type of layer you’ve selected,
this command enables you to change or adjust the contents of your
layer. For example, you can change the contents of a shape layer from a
solid color into a pattern.
 Arrange: This command enables you to shuffle your layer-stacking
order with commands. See Chapter 2 of this book for more on this topic.
 Group with Previous and Ungroup: The Group command creates a clip-
ping group, in which a group of layers is constrained to the boundaries
of a base layer. Find more details in Chapter 4 of this Book.
 Type: The commands on the Type submenu control the display of type
layers. For more on type, see Book V, Chapter 3.
 Rename Layer: This option enables you to give a layer a new name. You
can also simply double-click the name on the Layers panel.
 Simplify: This command converts a type layer, shape layer, or fill layer
into a regular image layer. In other words, it converts vector-based type
and images to pixel-based type and images. See Chapter 2 of this Book
for details.
 Merge and Flatten: The various Merge and Flatten commands combine
multiple layers into a single layer or, in the case of flattening, combine
all your layers into a single background. See Chapter 2 of this book for
more info.
 Palette Options: Choose Palette Options from the Layers panel menu
and select a thumbnail size. You can also choose whether to display just
the boundary of the layer contents or the whole document in the
thumbnail. 
The Select menu
Although the Select menu’s main duties are to assist you in making and
refining your selections, it offers a few handy layer commands. Here’s a
quick introduction to each command:
 Select All Layers: Want to quickly get everything in your file? Choose
Select➪All Layers. Note that this does not select the background.

338
 Select Layers of Similar Type: This command is helpful if you have differ-
ent types of layers in your document, such as regular layers, type layers,
shape layers, and adjustment layers, and you want to select just one
type. Select one of your layers and then choose Select➪Similar Layers.
 Deselect All Layers: Choose Select➪Deselect Layers.
Making Layers
Good, old-fashioned image layers are the backbone of the world of layers.
You can create multiple image layers within a single document. Even more
fun is creating a composite from several different images. The creative pos-
sibilities are endless. The following sections take a look at the various ways
to create these layers.
Creating a new layer
You can create a layer in a new file or an existing one. To go the new file
route, choose File➪New in the Editor, in Full Edit mode. Then, in the New
dialog box that appears, select Transparent for the Background Contents
option. (Note: Your new file appears labeled as Layer 1, rather than as
Background.)
If you have an open image and you want to create a new, blank layer, here’s
how to do so:
 In the Editor, in Full Edit mode, click the Create New Layer icon at
the top of the Layers panel. A layer with the default name of Layer 1
appears in the Layers panel.
 In the Editor, in Full Edit mode, select New Layer from the Layers
panel pop-up menu (located under More in the top right of the panel).
 Choose Layer➪New➪Layer. 
If you create a layer by using either of the preceding menu commands,
you open a dialog box in which you name your layer and can specify
other options for blending and opacity. Provide a name for your layer
and click OK. It is better to specify the other options directly in the
Layers panel later.
After your new transparent layer is ready to go, you can put content on the
new layer in several ways:
 Use one of the painting tools, such as the Brush or Pencil, and paint
directly on the layer.

Making Layers
339
 Make a selection on another layer or on the background within the
same document or from another image entirely. Then, choose
Edit➪Copy. Select your new blank layer in the Layers panel and
choose Edit➪Paste.
 Make a selection on another layer (or on the background) within the
same document or from another image, and then choose Edit➪Cut.
Select your new blank layer and choose Edit➪Paste. Just remember
that Elements deletes the selection from the source and adds it to your
new layer, as shown in Figure 1-11.
 Transfer an entire image to your new layer by choosing Select➪All
and then either Edit➪Copy or Edit➪Cut. Select your new blank layer
and choose Edit➪Paste.

Figure 1-11: Cutting and pasting a selection from one layer to another 
leaves a transparent hole on the original layer.
Using Layer via Copy and Layer via Cut
Another way to create a layer is to use the Layer via Copy command on the
Layer menu. Make a selection on a layer or background and choose
Layer➪New➪Layer via Copy. The copied selection is placed on a new layer
with the default name of Layer 1. You can do the same with the Layer via Cut
command, but in this case, Elements cuts, or deletes, the selected area from
the source layer or background, and places it on the new layer. The source
layer is left with a gaping, transparent or background-colored hole (refer to
Figure 1-11). Remember that you can use these two commands only within
the same image. You can’t use them between images.

Duplicating layers
If you want to duplicate an existing layer, first select it in the Layers panel.
Then, drag the layer to the Create New Layer icon at the top of the Layers
panel. You can also duplicate a layer by selecting Duplicate Layer from the
Layers panel pop-up menu or by choosing Layer➪Duplicate Layer. As when
you create a new layer, both menu methods prompt you with a dialog box to
name your layer and specify other options. Provide a name for your layer
and click OK. If you chose the first method, Elements provides the default
name of the original layer with the word Copy appended to the name.
Duplicating layers can be especially handy when you want to experiment
with a special effect but don’t want to harm your original image.
Compositing with Multiple Images
Often, when working with layers, you’re not just using a single image. Let’s
face it, you can only do so much to that family portrait taken down at the
local photo studio. But pluck your family out of that stale studio and put
them in front of the ruins at Pompeii or the summit at K2, and you have end-
less hours of fun. When you get the hang of working with several images,
you find that it opens up a whole new realm of creative possibilities. And
you’re not limited to just snapshots. You can incorporate type, shapes, and
scans of just about anything you can place on a scanning bed. Apply some
effects, maybe a filter or two, and you have an image worthy of some major
wall real estate.
Copying and pasting images
In the “Making Layers” section, earlier in this chapter, we explain how to
use the Copy, Cut, and Paste commands within the same image or between
two different images when you want to fill a new blank layer with content.
You can also use the Copy and Paste commands without having a blank
layer ready. When you copy and paste a selection without a blank layer,
Elements automatically creates a new layer from the pasted selection. You
can go on your merry way and perform all your layer creations by using
only those commands. However, we rarely use them when working with
multiple images. We prefer the drag-and-drop method, which we describe in
the following section.
The Copy Merged command on the Edit menu creates a merged (or joined)
copy of all visible layers within the selection. 
Dragging and dropping layers
Be sure to check out the sidebar “Bypassing the Clipboard,” in this chapter,
for more on dragging and dropping.

Compositing with Multiple Images
341
Follow these steps to drag and drop layers from one file to another:
1. In the Editor, in Full Edit mode, open two or more images.
2. In one of your images, select your desired layer in the Layers panel.
3. Grab the Move tool (the four-headed arrow) from the Tools panel.
4. Position the Move tool within your desired image and click then drag
and drop the layer onto your destination file.
The dropped layer pops in as a new layer above the active layer in the
image, as shown in Figure 1-12. You don’t need to have a selection
border to copy the entire layer. But, if you want to copy just a portion of
the layer, make your selection before you drag and drop with the Move
tool. If you want the selected element to be centered on the destination
file, press the Shift key while you drag and drop.
What if you have multiple elements on one layer and want to select only one
of the elements to drag and drop? Simply grab the Lasso tool and draw
around the object. You don’t have to be super-precise, but don’t include 
any portion of the other elements on the layer. Then, hold down the Ctrl key
(Ô key on the Mac) and press the up-arrow key once. The element then
becomes neatly selected. Not only can you drag and drop the element, but
you can also move or edit it without affecting the other pixels on the layer.
Flip to Book IV, Chapter 1 for help with making selections.
Book VI
Chapter 1
Creating Layers
Bypassing the Clipboard
Yes, you can always cut and paste or copy and
paste a layer from one image to another, but we
prefer to drag and drop, rather than copy and
paste, between two images. By dragging and
dropping, you bypass the temporary storage
area for copied and stored data, the Clipboard.
(Whenever you copy or cut a selection,
Elements stores the selection on the Clipboard
until you’re ready to paste it to its new home.)
So, what’s wrong with that? Well, nothing,
unless you’re working with high-resolution
images. Storing images on the Clipboard, even
on a temporary basis, can slow down your
system. Keeping your Clipboard clear of data
ensures that Elements is running lean and mean
so that you can drag and drop more images,
selections, and layers more quickly and more
efficiently. If you want to hold a little spring
cleaning on your Clipboard, you can always
choose Edit➪Clear➪Clipboard Contents, which
empties your Clipboard of any stored data.

Figure 1-12: Dragging and dropping a selection keeps your Clipboard 
lean and mean.
Using the Paste into Selection command
The Paste into Selection command lets you put a copied or cut image on a
separate layer while at the same time inserting that image into a selection
border on another layer. That’s where Edit➪Paste into Selection command
comes in handy. 
For example, if you want to make it appear as if a snake is poking its head
out of the opening of a cave or a paintbrush is poking out of a can, Paste into
Selection is your command. Be sure to check out the Putting It Together proj-
ect in this chapter to get more practice at this practical technique.
Follow these steps to insert a copied or cut selected image into a selection
outline:
1. In the Editor, in Full Edit mode, make the selection on the layer that
you want the image to fill.
This is called the destination layer.
2. Select the image that will fill that selection.
This is called the source image. This image can be within the same file
or from another file.

343
3. Choose Edit➪Copy.
4. Return to the destination image
layer and choose Edit➪Paste Into
Selection.
The pasted selection is visible
only inside the selection outline,
as shown in Figure 1-13. If neces-
sary, reposition your pasted selec-
tion with the Move tool. If you
need to scale the pasted selection,
choose Image➪Transform➪Free
Transform. For more on transfor-
mations, see Chapter 2 of this
Book. In our example, our carrots
are showing only inside my selec-
tion. The bottom of the carrots are
hidden, making it look as though
they are sitting inside the Chinese
take-out container.

Putting It Together
Creating Layers and Using the Paste into Selection 
Command to Make a Collage
You probably remember from elementary school cutting out a bunch of pictures from
magazines and pasting them on a piece of construction paper. Well, with Elements, the
idea of a collage isn’t much different, but the activity is a little more refined.
Maybe you want to unleash your artistic side. Or maybe you need to combine several
images into one as part of a job. Whatever your reason, you can use the steps here to get

started on your first collage. And by the way, if collage is too prissy a word for you, you
can substitute it with composite — which has the definition of “derived from many com-
ponents.” We usually do.
Creating a collage takes many steps. Throughout Book VI, you can find several ongoing
Putting It Together projects, all of which build on each other and lead you to a finished
collage. Be sure to save your collage file so that you can work on it while you make your
way through this mini-book, if you like.
If you’re short on photos, you can go to www.gettyimages.com. Be sure to register
so that you have access to a huge gallery of free comping images. Comping images are
small, low-resolution images used for internal corporate or personal noncommercial 
use only. You can also purchase high-resolution images for a song ($1 to $20) at www.
istockphoto.com or www.stockxpert.com. If that’s too pricey for you, check
out Stock.xchng at www.sxc.hu, where you can find user-uploaded files and download
them free. Just be sure to ask for the photographer’s permission if you want to use the
images for anything other than practice.
To create the first layer of your collage, follow these steps:
1. Decide on two images you want to use in your collage and open them in the Editor,
in Full Edit mode, by choosing File➪Open.
You can pick an image to use as your main canvas and then open up a supporting
image that you can select and then drag onto that main image. However, if you
want, you can also start with just a blank document, which is what we’ve done. We
then filled our blank image with light green. See Book V, Chapter 2 for details on fill-
ing with color.

2. Choose Window➪Layers to open the
Layers panel.
Always be sure that the Layers panel
is visible whenever you’re creating a
composite from multiple images. You
need to see what’s happening while
you drag and drop, and you need to be
aware of what layer you’re working on
at all times.
3. Select the desired element in the sup-
porting image.
Feel free to use whatever selection
method suits your fancy, but remem-
ber, the finished collage will look only
as good as its individual selections.
For more on making selections, see
Book IV.
We used the Quick Selection tool to
select the girl. We then used the Lasso
tool and cleaned up our selection
border.
4. Choose Select➪Modify➪Contract and, in the Contract Selection dialog box, enter
a value. Then, choose Select➪Feather and enter a value in the Feather Selection
dialog box.
Contract the selections lightly (we chose a value of 1 pixel) before you apply a
feather (we chose a 0.5 pixel value) to avoid picking up some of the background
during the feathering process. Note that the values you choose depend on the reso-
lution of your images; the lower the resolution, the smaller the value needed.
Using a small feather helps to avoid the harsh, I-cut-it-out-with-a-pair-of-pinking-
shears look.
5. With the Move tool, drag and drop the selection onto the background image.
The Layers panel shows that you’ve produced a layer. Notice that your main image
remains as the background below the layer, as shown in the figure.

Don’t worry if your element isn’t the right size. You can find a Putting It Together
project in Book V, Chapter 2 that shows you how to scale the layer.
6. Choose File➪Save As. In the Save As dialog box, name the file collage and make
sure the format is Photoshop. 
Keep the file in a handy spot on your hard drive so that you can find it when you’re
ready to do more with your collage.
In the preceding steps, we show you how to create a layer by dragging and dropping an
image onto a background image. The process we demonstrate in the following steps is a
little different. It entails pasting one selection into another.
To paste one selection into another on your collage, follow these steps:
1. In the Editor, in Full Edit mode, choose File➪Open. Select the file you saved from
the last exercise. Also, open a new supporting image.
2. Choose Window➪Layers to open the Layers panel.
Always keep the Layers panel visible whenever you’re creating a composite from
multiple images.

3. Select the part of the supporting image that you want to use.
Feel free to use whatever selection method you desire, but try to get as accurate a
selection as you can.
We wanted to use the whole image, so we chose Select➪All.
4. Contract and feather the selection (as described in Step 4 in the preceding set of
steps).
Unless you’re going for some special effect, be consistent with the treatment of the
edges of each of your elements in your composite.
We bypassed this step because we are using the entire image.
5. Choose Edit➪Copy.
6. In your saved collage file, use the Lasso tool (or any other selection tool) to create
a selection in which to paste your new supporting image.
We selected the blank screen of the girl’s laptop with the Polygonal Lasso tool.

H
opefully, you had the time and inclination to check out the first chap-
ter of Book VI. That’s where you get all the basic information on creat-
ing layers. In this chapter, you get all the details on how to manage the
layers you’ve created. And unlike some employees, clients, or children,
layers are extremely agreeable to being managed — even micromanaged, for
that matter. You can scale and rotate them, hide them, rearrange them, link
and lock them, and even condense them into one loving, collective layer.
Yes, Elements has a slew of ways to get your layers lined up in the orderly
and organized fashion you deserve.
Viewing Layers
Often, hiding all the layers in your image except for
the one you want to edit is useful. You can then focus
on the element at hand without the distraction of all
the other elements of the image. You can hide
layers with a single quick click of the mouse
button, as we describe in the following list:
 Hide all the layers but one. Select the layer
you want to display. Alt-click (Option-click on
the Mac) the eye icon for that layer in the left
column of the Layers panel and all other layers dis-
appear from view. To redisplay all the layers, Alt-click
(Option-click on the Mac) the eye icon again.
 Hide an individual layer. Click the eye icon for that layer, as
shown in Figure 2-1. To redisplay the layer, click the blank space in the
eye column.

Rearranging Layers
350
Corbis Digital Stock/Purestock
Figure 2-1: You can hide and show individual layers to better focus your tasks.
Only visible layers print. Hiding layers for printing can be useful if you want
to have several versions (each on a separate layer) of an image for a project
within the same document. You can view selective layers, print them, get
approval from the powers that be, and then delete the layers with the
scrapped versions. Only one file to manage — even we can handle that.
Rearranging Layers
You can shuffle the order of layers like clear sheets of acetate used with
overhead projectors. The stacking order of the layers in the Layers panel
corresponds to the order of the layers in the document. If you want to move
a layer to another position in the stacking order, drag the layer up or down
in the Layers panel. While you drag, you see a fist icon. Release your mouse
button when a highlighted line appears where you want to insert the layer.
Alternatively, you can change the order by selecting the layer and then
choosing Layer➪Arrange. Then, select one of the following commands from
the submenu:

Moving Layer Elements
351
 Bring to Front and Send to Back: Send the layer to the top or bottom of
the stacking order.
 Bring Forward and Send Backward: Move the layer one level up or
down.
 Reverse: Switch the order of your layer stack when you have two or
more layers selected.
If your image has a background, it always remains the bottommost layer. If
you need to move the background, first convert it to a layer by double-click-
ing the name in the Layers panel. Enter a new name for the layer and then
click OK.
Moving Layer Elements
Rearranging layers is different from moving the content on the layer.
Because the elements on a layer are free-floating on a bed of transparency,
it’s easy to move the element whenever necessary. Moving the element on
one layer has no effect on any of the other layers, and it doesn’t harm the
image at all. 
To move an image on a layer, first select the layer in the Layers panel. Then,
position your Move tool (the four-headed arrow in the Tools panel) any-
where on the image and drag it to your desired position. It doesn’t get any
simpler than that. Here are a few more handy tips when moving an image
and using the Move tool:
 Move the image on the layer in 1-pixel increments. Press an arrow key
when you have the Move tool selected. To move the layer in 10-pixel
increments, press Shift when you press the arrow key.
 Find out what layer holds the image you want to move or edit. If you
have the Auto-Select Layer option selected in the Options bar, select the
Move tool and click the element. Elements automatically activates the
layer that the element resides on. If you don’t have this option checked,
then Ctrl-click (Ô-click on the Mac) the image.
 Switch to a layer when you click with the Move tool on any part of a
layer. To do this trick, you need to select the Auto-Select Layer option
on the Options bar. But be careful when using this option, especially if
you have a lot of overlapping elements — you may inadvertently select
a layer when you don’t want to.
 Display a bounding box (a rectangle that encloses a selection or
image on a layer) that has handles around the elements on your layer.
To do this one, select the Show Bounding Box check box on the Options
bar. This box can be useful if all your elements are melting into one
another in an indistinguishable conglomeration.
Book VI
Chapter 2
Managing Layers

Transforming Layers
352
We recommend keeping this option checked so that you essentially
have the same controls (scale, rotate, and so on) as when you choose
Image➪Transform➪Free Transform.
 Show Highlight on Rollover: Hover your mouse on any element found
on the canvas and an outline magically appears around the element on
your layer. Click the highlighted layer to select it and then move it.
Transforming Layers
When working with multiple images, you no doubt have to scale, or even
rotate, some of your images to fit them into your composite. Fortunately,
Elements makes scaling an easy chore by providing you with the Transform
and Free Transform commands on the Image menu. When it comes to trans-
forming layers and transforming selections, the methods are identical. After
an element is on a layer, you can just choose the appropriate transforma-
tion command and off you go. In addition, you can apply a transformation to
multiple layers simultaneously if you select the various layers first. 
Here’s how to transform a layer:
1. In the Editor, in Full Edit mode, select your desired layer in the
Layers panel.
You can also apply a transformation to multiple layers simultaneously
by linking the layers first. For details, see “Linking Layers,” later in this
chapter.
2. Choose Image➪Transform➪Free Transform.
A bounding box surrounds the contents of your layer, as shown in
Figure 2-2. (In our example, the bounding box surrounds Layer 3.) Drag
a corner or side handle to size the contents. Press Shift while dragging
to constrain the proportions. You can also click the link icon between
the W and H fields to do the same. To rotate the contents, move the
mouse cursor just outside a corner handle until it turns into a curved
arrow and then drag. To distort, skew, or apply perspective to the con-
tents, right-click and choose the desired command from the contextual
menu that appears. You can also click the Rotate, Scale, and Skew icons
in the Options bar as well as enter your transform values numerically in
the fields.
If you want to apply just a single transformation, you can also choose
the individual Distort, Skew, and Perspective commands from the
Image➪Transform menu. Or, to rotate or flip, you can choose Image➪
Rotate.

Transforming Layers
353
3. When your layer is transformed to your liking, double-click inside the
bounding box.
The bounding box disappears, leaving behind your transformed layer.
Corbis Digital Stock/Purestock
Figure 2-2: Transform your layers.
Try to perform all your transformations in one execution. Don’t go back
numerous times and apply various transformations. Each time you trans-
form pixels, you put your image through the interpolation process (increas-
ing, decreasing, or remapping pixels). Done repeatedly, this process can
degrade the quality of your image. This is why it’s prudent to use the
Transform➪Free Transform command rather than individual commands —
so that all transformations are executed in one fell swoop.
If your image looks jagged after you transform it, you may have your prefer-
ences set incorrectly for your interpolation method. Choose Edit➪
Preferences➪General (Elements➪Preferences➪General on the Mac) and
then choose the Bicubic option from the Image Interpolation pop-up menu.
Bicubic enables a smoother appearance to your interpolated pixels. You can
also try Bicubic Smoother when resampling up (upsampling) and Bicubic
Sharper when resampling down (downsampling). For more on resolution
and resampling issues, see Book III, Chapter 1.

Simplifying Layers
354
Simplifying Layers
When you simplify a layer, you are simply converting a type layer, shape
layer, or fill layer into a regular image layer. You want to do this to apply fil-
ters or to edit the layers with painting tools. However, simplifying does
come with a price. After you simplify a shape layer, for example, you no
longer have access to the shape-editing options, only the editing options
available to a regular image layer. And when you simplify a type layer, your
text is converted to pixels so you can’t edit your text anymore. The moral of
the story? Be sure your type is spelled and formatted to your liking prior to
simplifying.
Here’s how to simplify a layer:
1. In the Editor, in Full Edit mode, select your desired layer in the
Layers panel.
2. Choose Layer➪Simplify Layer. You can also choose the command
from the Layers panel More menu. If you select a shape layer, you
can also click the Simplify command in the Options bar.
Transforming and Moving Layers in a Collage
When you have a couple of images in your collage (see the Putting It Together project in
Book VI, Chapter 1), you can start transforming them to your liking. Moving and scaling
are the manipulations you’ll probably do the most. Elements enables you to transform
layers without affecting any other layer within the image. To transform and move images
in a collage, follow these steps:
1. In the Editor, in Full Edit mode, choose File➪Open. Select your saved collage file in
the dialog box that opens.
2. Choose Window➪Layers to open the Layers panel.
3. In the Layers panel, select the layer (or layers) you want to transform.
In our example, we chose the layers that have the girl and the picture on the screen
of the laptop.
4. Choose Image➪Transform➪Free Transform.
The Free Transform bounding box appears around your layer.
By choosing Free Transform, you interpolate the image only once, rather than multi-
ple times.

5. Shift-drag a corner transformation handle to scale the image down to the desired
size but maintain the proportions, which reduces the amount of distortion.
We reduced the girl and screen about 20%.
6. Position the cursor just outside the handle until a curved arrow appears. Rotate the
image the desired amount. 
Our layers didn’t need any rotation.
7. After you scale and rotate your image, place the cursor inside the Free Transform
bounding box and position your layer elements by dragging them to your desired
location.
We positioned our layers at the bottom of the Image window.

8. When you transform the selection to your liking, double-click inside the Free
Transform bounding box or press Enter (Return on the Mac).
9. Transform any remaining layers, following Steps 3 to 8.
If you are transforming a layer with a layer mask, be sure to choose the layer’s
thumbnail and not the layer mask thumbnail. Otherwise, you transform the layer
mask, rather than the layer.
10.As always, when you transform a selection to your liking, double-click inside the
Free Transform bounding box.
11.Choose File➪Save.
You probably already have a pretty good sense of the possibilities (which are infinite)
available to you when you create and change collages. Of course, you can always add
more stuff to a collage and rearrange the layers, as needed. Just follow these steps:
1. In the Editor, in Full mode, choose File➪Open and select your collage file. Also
open another image.
We chose an image of a temple in Kyoto.
2. Choose Window➪Layers to open the Layers panel — if it isn’t already visible.
3. Select the desired element in the new image you open.
It goes without saying that making the selection accurate can only enhance your
composite. We wanted to use our whole image, so we didn’t need to make a 
selection.
4. Contract and feather the image’s edges (as described in the Putting It Together in
Chapter 1 of this minibook) and use the Move tool to drag the selection into the
collage file.
For the most consistent appearance possible, use consistent values for modifying
and feathering all the selections in this composite.
5. Position and transform the selection, as needed.
Follow the directions provided in the preceding step list. In our example, we scaled
the temple image about 50 percent smaller and positioned it in the upper-right
corner.
6. In the Layers panel, rearrange your layers, if needed, by selecting a layer and drag-
ging it above another layer.
In our image, we dragged the temple layer below the girl and screen layers, as
shown in the figure.
Because layers are independent entities, you can shuffle them indefinitely like a
deck of cards.

Aligning and Distributing Layers
357
Aligning and Distributing Layers
If you’re a precision junkie like us, you’ll appreciate Elements’ ability to align
and distribute your layers. These commands can be especially useful when
you need to align such items as navigation buttons on a Web page mock-up
or a row of headshots for a corporate publication.
Follow these steps to align and distribute your layers:
1. In the Editor, in Full Edit mode, select the layers you want to align in
the Layers panel, as shown in Figure 2-3.
Select your first layer and then Ctrl-click (Cmd-click on the Mac) to
select more layers. 
2. With the Move tool selected from the Tools panel, click the Alignment
option in the Options bar and choose an alignment option from the
drop-down list.
Elements provides you with handy little icons that illustrate the various
alignment types, as shown in Figure 2-4.

Note that, depending on which alignment type you choose, Elements
aligns to the layer element that’s the farthest from the top, bottom, left,

the various layers.
3. In the Layers panel, select three or more layers that you want to 
distribute evenly.

Linking Layers
You’ll probably find that you don’t need to link layers in most cases. Simply
select multiple layers and apply your command — moving, scaling, rotating,
and so on. Occasionally, however, you may want to link layers so that they
stay grouped as a unit until you decide otherwise.
To link layers, follow these short steps:
1. In the Editor, in Full Edit mode, select your desired layers in the
Layers panel.
2. Click the Link Layers icon at the top of the Layers panel, as shown in
Figure 2-6.
A link icon appears to the right of the layer name in the Layers panel.
To remove a link, click the Link Layers icon again.
Locking Layers
After you have your layers how you
want them, you may want to lock 
them to prevent them from being
changed, as shown in Figure 2-7. To
lock a layer, select it in the Layers
panel and select one of the two lock
options at the top of the Layers panel.
The checkerboard square icon locks
all transparent areas of your layers.
This prevents you from painting or
editing any transparent areas on the
layers. The lock icon locks your entire
layer and prevents it from being
changed in any way, including moving
or transforming the elements on the
layer. You can, however, still make
selections on the layer. To unlock the
layer, simply click the icon again to
toggle off the lock.
Figure 2-6: Use the Link Layers command
to group your layers.

By default, the background is locked
and can’t be unlocked until you con-
vert the background into a layer by
choosing Layer➪New➪Layer from
Background. In addition, by default,
type and shape layers have the Lock
Transparent Pixels option selected.
These options are gray and can’t be
deselected. However, if you need to
paint on the type or shape layer, you
can always simplify it (as described
earlier in this chapter), thereby 
removing the locked option.
Flattening and Merging Layers
Being the true layers evangelists that
we are, we tout the glories of layers in
the first chapter of this minibook. And,
although layers are wonderful, they do
have a dark side. They can make your
file go from slim and trim to bulky and
bloated. You not only get a larger file
size that slows your computer
system’s performance, but you’re also
limited to the file formats that allow
you to save layers: Photoshop’s native format (.psd), TIFF (.tif), and PDF
(.pdf). If you save your file in any other format, Elements smushes your
layers down into a Background. This file limitation often forces users to save
two versions of every layered file — one as a native Photoshop file and one
as something else, such as EPS or JPEG, to import into another program.
(For more on file formats, see Book III, Chapter 2.)
To curb large file sizes or to use your image in a nonlayer supporting format,
you have a couple of options:
 Merging layers: Combines visible, linked, or adjacent layers into a
single layer (not a background). The intersection of all transparent
areas is retained. You can also merge adjustment or fill layers, but they
can’t act as the target layer for the merge. Merging layers can help
decrease your file size and make your document more manageable.
You’re still restricted to the layer-friendly file formats, however.

 Flattening an image: Combines all visible layers into a background.
Elements deletes hidden layers and fills any transparent areas with
white. Flattening is usually reserved for when you’re completely fin-
ished editing your image. We recommend, however, that before you flat-
ten your image, you make a copy of the file with all its layers intact and
save it as a native Photoshop file. That way, if you ever need to make
any edits, you have the added flexibility of having your layers.
Merging layers
You can merge your layers several ways. However, to use the first option,
follow these steps:
1. In the Editor, in Full Edit mode,
ensure that all the layers that
you want to merge are visible in
the Layers panel, as shown in
Figure 2-8.
2. Choose Merge Visible from the
Layers panel pop-up menu or 
the Layer menu.
All visible layers merge into 
a single layer, as shown in 
Figure 2-8. 
Hold down Alt (Option on the Mac)
when choosing Layer➪Merge Visible.
Elements merges those layers onto a
new layer.
You can also merge layers by following
these steps:
1. Position the layers that you want
to merge adjacent to each other
in the Layers panel.
2. Select the top layer of those you
want merged.
Figure 2-8: Merging layers can make your
file size a lot smaller.

Flattening and Merging Layers
363
3. Choose Merge Down from the Layers panel pop-up menu or the Layer
menu.
Note that Merge Down merges your active layer with the layer directly
below it.
Flattening layers
To flatten an image into a single background, follow these steps:
1. In the Editor, in Full Edit mode,
ensure that all the layers you
want to retain are visible in the
Layers panel.
Elements discards all hidden
layers.
2. Choose Layer➪Flatten Image 
or choose Flatten Image from 
the Layers panel pop-up 
menu.
The transparent areas of flattened
images fill with the background
color and appear as a Background
in the Layers panel, as shown in
Figure 2-9.
If you mistakenly flatten your
image, you can undo the 
command immediately by 
choosing Edit➪Undo. If you go
ahead and perform another
action, then undo your mistake 
by using the Undo History panel.
However, note that if the flattening
step is no longer in the Undo
History panel, there is no way to
undo the flattening.

you’re sure you won’t need individual layers

Checking Your Collage for Flaws and Consolidating Layers
When you begin a project, you may think you know what you want the result to look like.
But when your creative juices start flowing, you may decide that something doesn’t look
right. For example, while we were working on our collage, we felt that our green back-
ground was a little boring.
1. In the Editor, in Full Edit mode, open
the saved collage file and open a new
image that you want to incorporate
into the collage.
In our example, we thought the green
background needed some texture, so
we opened an image that contained
some Japanese characters we liked.
2. Select the part of the image that you
want to add to your collage, as shown
in the figure.
We wanted the whole image, so we
didn’t need to make a selection.
3. With the Move tool, drag and drop
your new selection, or entire image,
onto your collage image.
4. Choose Image➪Transform➪Free
Transform.
Transform and position your new layer,
as described in the earlier Putting It
Together exercise.
When you’re close to finalizing your collage, you might want to consolidate layers.
Minimizing the number of layers makes projects easier to manage and your file size
smaller, which is great when you get ready to add the finishing touches to your 
collage.

Before you merge your layers, be sure that you’ll never have to manipulate them sepa-
rately again, especially if the elements on the layer overlap each other, as ours do.
To consolidate two layers, follow these steps:
1. In the Editor, in Full Edit mode, select the layers in the Layers panel.
2. Choose Merge Layers from the Layers panel pop-up menu.
The two layers merge and become one.
3. Choose File➪Save.

Chapter 3: Playing with Opacity
and Blend Modes
In This Chapter
 Adjusting opacity
 Applying blend modes for effects
 Setting the blend options
I
n this chapter, we show you how to have a little fun and get those cre-
ative juices flowing. This chapter, along with Chapters 1 and 3 in Book
VII, gives you a few ways to tweak the layers you’ve so diligently created.
Maybe you want to make one of your layers semitransparent so that you
can see the layer beneath it; or you might want to try blending the colors
between a couple layers in a way that’s slightly offbeat. Look no further.
Take these techniques as far as you want. And remember, there’s no substi-
tute for good, old experimentation. Before you jump into these techniques,
it helps to have a handle on the methods of layer creation and management
that we explain in Book VI, Chapters 1 and 2.
Adjusting Layer Opacity
By far one of the easiest ways to make your image look
interesting is to have one image ghosted over
another, as shown in Figure 3-1. Creating this effect
is an easy task with the Opacity option in the
Layers panel. You adjust the opacity by selecting
your desired layer in the Layers panel. Then, either
access the slider by clicking the right-pointing
arrow or enter a percentage value in the Opacity
text box.

Creatively Mixing with Blend Modes
368
Corbis Digital Stock
Figure 3-1: Adjusting the opacity enables one image to ghost over another.
The Opacity setting allows you to mix the active layer with the layers below
it in varying percentages from 100% (completely opaque) to 0% (completely
transparent). Remember that you can adjust the opacity only on a layer, not
a background.
You can also change the Opacity percentage by using keyboard shortcuts.
With any tool active, except a painting or editing tool, press a number key.
Press 5 for 50%, 25 for 25%. If you’re entering a two-digit value, just be sure
you type the numbers quickly, or else Elements interprets the numbers as
two different values. You get the picture. Note that for the default of 100%,
you must press 0.
Creatively Mixing with Blend Modes
Elements sports an impressive 25 blend modes. Blend modes affect how
colors interact between layers and how colors interact when you apply
paint to a layer. Blend modes can produce a multitude of interesting, 

Creatively Mixing with Blend Modes
369
sometimes even bizarre, effects. What’s more, you can easily apply, edit, or
discard blend modes without modifying your image pixels one iota.
The blend modes are located on a drop-down list at the top of your Layers
panel in Full Edit mode. The best way to get a feel for the effect of blend
modes is not to memorize the descriptions we give you in the following sec-
tions. Instead, grab an image with some layers and apply each of the blend
modes to one or more of the layers to see what happens. In fact, try a few
different images because the effects may be subtle or intense, depending on
the colors in the image. Throw in some different opacity percentages, and
you’re on your way to endless hours of creative fun.
You’ll find these modes called blend modes, painting modes, brush modes,
layer modes, calculations, or just plain modes. They’re usually referred to as
blend modes or layer modes when used with layers and painting modes, and
brush modes when used in conjunction with a painting or editing tool.
General blend modes
The Normal blend mode doesn’t require an explanation. It’s the one you
probably use the most. Dissolve is the next one on the list and, ironically, is
probably the one you use the least. See both at work in Figure 3-2.
 Normal: The default mode displays each pixel unadjusted.
 Dissolve: This mode can be seen only on a layer with an opacity setting
of less than 100%. The lower the opacity, the more intense the effect.
Dissolve allows some pixels from lower layers, which are randomized,
to show through the target (selected) layer.
Blend modes that darken
Overall, the blend modes we cover in this section all produce effects that
darken your image, as shown in Figure 3-3.
Here is one of our favorite uses for the Darken blend mode. Scan a handwrit-
ten letter or sheet of music and layer it over an image. Apply the Darken
blend mode to the letter or sheet music layer. The white areas of the paper
become transparent, and only the letters or musical notes display, creating
a nice composite image.

Figure 3-2: The Dissolve blend mode enables pixels from one layer to 
peek randomly through another layer. 
 Darken: Turns lighter pixels transparent if the pixels on the target layer
are lighter than those on layers below. If the pixels are darker, they’re
unchanged.
 Multiply: Burns the target layer onto the layers underneath, thereby
darkening all colors where they mix. With layers, it is comparable to
sticking two slides in the same slot in a slide projector. When you’re
painting with the Brush or Pencil tool, each stroke creates a darker
color, as though you’re drawing with markers.

 Color Burn: Darkens the layers underneath the target layer and burns
them with color, creating an increased contrast effect, like applying a
dark dye to your image. Blending with white pixels has no effect.
 Linear Burn: Darkens the layers underneath the target layer by decreas-
ing the brightness. This effect is similar to Multiply but often makes por-
tions of your image black. Blending with white has no effect.
 Darker Color: When blending two layers, the darker color of the two
colors is visible.
Digital Vision, Purestock 
Figure 3-3: These blend modes darken, or burn, your layers.
Blend modes that lighten
If you have blend modes that darken, well, having modes that lighten just
makes good sense. So, if you have the need to throw some digital bleach on
your brightly colored pixels, try out a couple of these blend modes, as
shown in Figure 3-4.

 Lighten: Turns darker pixels transparent if the pixels on the target layer
are darker than those on layers below. If the pixels are lighter, they’re
unchanged. This effect is the opposite of Darken.
 Screen: Lightens the target layer where it mixes with the layers under-
neath. Blending with black has no effect. Like putting two slides in dif-
ferent projectors and pointing them at the same screen. This effect is
the opposite of Multiply.
 Color Dodge: Lightens the pixels in the layers underneath the target
layer and infuses them with colors from the top layer. Blending with black
with has effect. This effect is similar to applying a bleach to your image.
 Linear Dodge: Lightens the layers underneath the target layer by increas-
ing the brightness. This effect is similar to Screen but often makes parts
of your image pure white. Blending with black pixels has no effect.
 Lighter Color: When blending two layers, the lighter color of the two
colors is visible.

Lighting blend modes
This group of blend modes plays with the lighting in your layers. Some of
these blend modes, such as Pin Light, are reserved for the occasional wacky
special effect. See the blend modes in action in Figure 3-5:
 Overlay: Multiplies the dark pixels in the target layer and screens the
light pixels in the underlying layers. Enhances the contrast and satura-
tion of colors.
 Soft Light: Darkens the dark pixels (greater than 50% gray) and lightens
the light pixels (less than 50% gray). Blending with black or white
results in darker or lighter pixels, but doesn’t make parts of your image
pure black or pure white. Similar to Overlay, but softer and subtler. The
effect is like shining a soft spotlight on the image.
 Hard Light: This mode multiplies the dark pixels (greater than 50%
gray) and screens the light pixels (less than 50% gray). Can be used to
add highlights and shadows to an image. Blending with black or white
gives you black and white. The effect is similar to shining a bright, hard
spotlight on the image. 
 Vivid Light: If the pixels on the top layer are darker than 50% gray, this
mode darkens the colors by increasing the contrast. If the pixels on the
top layer are lighter than 50% gray, the mode lightens the colors by
decreasing the contrast. A combination of Color Burn and Color Dodge.
 Linear Light: If the pixels on the top layer are darker than 50% gray, the
mode darkens the colors by decreasing the brightness. If the pixels on
the top layer are lighter than 50% gray, the mode lightens the colors by
increasing the brightness. A combination of Linear Burn and Linear
Dodge.
 Pin Light: Replaces the colors of pixels, depending on the colors in the
top layer. If the pixels on the top layer are darker than 50% gray, the
mode replaces the pixels that are darker than those on the top layer and
doesn’t change pixels that are lighter. If the pixels on the top layer are
lighter than 50% gray, the mode replaces the pixels that are lighter than
those pixels on the top layer and doesn’t change pixels that are darker.
A combination of Darken and Lighten; useful for special effects.
 Hard Mix: Similar to Vivid Light, but reduces the colors to a total of
eight — cyan, magenta, yellow, black, red, green, blue, and white.
Although the results depend on the mix of existing colors on the top
and bottom layers, this mode usually creates a highly posterized (a car-
toon or flat illustration) effect.

Blend modes that invert
If the blend modes discussed in the preceding sections are a little too
sedate for you, you may want to experiment with the inverters — Difference
and Exclusion. These blend modes invert your colors and can produce
some interesting special effects, as shown in Figure 3-6.

 Difference: Produces a negative, or inverted, effect according to the
brightness values on the top layers. If the pixels on the top layer are
black, no change occurs in the underlying layers. If the pixels on the top
layer are white, the mode inverts the colors of the underlying layers.
Can produce some intense effects.
 Exclusion: Like Difference, but with less contrast and saturation. If the
pixels on the top layer are black, no change occurs in the underlying
layers. If the pixels on the top layer are white, this mode inverts the colors
of the underlying layers. Medium colors blend to create shades of gray.

HSL color model blend modes
These blend modes use the HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness) color model to
mix colors, as shown in Figure 3-7. 
 Hue: Blends the luminance (brightness) and saturation (intensity of the
color) of the underlying layers with the hue (color) of the top layer.
 Saturation: Blends the luminance and hue of the underlying layers with
the saturation of the top layer.
 Color: Blends the luminance of the underlying layers with the saturation
and hue of the top layer. This mode enables you to paint color while pre-
serving the shadows, highlights, and details of the underlying layers.
Our favorite blend mode in this group is Color, which allows you to apply
color to images without obscuring the tonality. The Color mode is great for
“hand painting” grayscale images. If you’ve ever admired those hand-tinted
black-and-white photos used in greeting cards and posters, you can create
the same effect fairly easily. First, make sure that your black-and-white
image is in RGB (red, green, blue) mode so that it can accept color. Create a
new layer on the Layers panel and set it to the Color blend mode. Grab the
Brush tool (with a soft-edged tip), choose your desired color, and paint
over your image. Adjust your opacity to less than 100% to create a softer
effect. See details on this technique in Book V, Chapter 1.
 Luminosity: The opposite of Color, this mode blends the hue and satura-
tion of the underlying layers with the luminance of the top layer. This
mode also preserves the shadows, highlights, and details from the top
layer and mixes them with the colors of the underlying layers.

Adjusting Opacity Settings in Your Collage
If you’ve followed along with the Putting It Together projects we discuss in Book VI,
Chapters 1 and 2, you may have a collage that you’re pretty satisfied with. You just need
to make the final tweaks to get it to the state of perfection.
One of the most important tweaks you can make concerns opacity. Follow these steps to
adjust the opacity settings on some of the layers:
1. In the Editor, in Full Edit mode, open your saved collage file.
2. If the Layers panel isn’t already visible, choose Window➪Layers to open it.
3. Select a layer in your collage and move the opacity slider, located at the top of the
Layers panel, to the left or right.
If you want the layer to be more opaque, move the slider to the right. If you’re inter-
ested in making the layer more transparent, move the slider to the left.
We chose our Japanese characters layer and adjusted the opacity to 10%. We
wanted the characters to create just a subtle texture, not to appear full strength.
istockphoto.com, Corbis Digital Stock
4. Save the file and then move on to the next layer that you want to adjust.
If you have more complicated opacity settings to adjust, keep reading.
5. Select another layer and then choose Duplicate Layer from the Layers panel 
pop-up menu. Click OK to close the Duplicate Layer dialog box.
Making a copy a layer is great because it allows you to add a blend mode and then
adjust it to get just the right amount of the effect.

For example, if you want to define an element in your collage, but applying it directly 
on the layer makes the effect too intense, make a copy of the layer. We made a copy 
of our temple layer.
6. Select the duplicated layer and choose a mode (such as Soft Light) from the Blend
Mode pop-up menu in the Layers panel.
Leaving our duplicated and blended layer at 100% opacity is a little too garish.
7. Adjust the opacity to tone it down as much as you desire.
We brought ours down to 25%.

8. When you’re satisfied with the opacity and contrast, save the collage file.
Oh, by the way, we added a dark green border and a lucky cat to our collage.

 Creating clipping groups 
I
n Book IV, we presented you with lots of information about making selec-
tions with the many tools that Elements provides for that very purpose,
such as the Marquee and Lasso tools, the Magic Wand, the Quick Selection
tool, and the Selection Brush. But we left the discussion of a few tools until
this chapter. The tools in Book IV involve making selections by dragging
around, clicking, or painting over. And while the end result is similar —
selecting what you want or don’t want in an image — the tools in this chap-
ter are a little different in their methodology. They involve cutting out,
extracting from, and erasing around.
To add to your selection repertoire, we give you details on layer masking, a
feature that is the most versatile way to get what you want out of
an image. Layer masking is essentially just another way of
making a selection. Instead of defining your selection with
a selection outline or by erasing away what you don’t
want, you can use masks to define your selection with
up to 256 levels of gray. This gives you varying levels
of selection. You can choose to fully show your
layer, partially show it, or hide (or mask) certain
areas. The nice thing about layer masks is that you
can creatively blend one layer into another in a
multitude of different ways. 
We round out the chapter by showing you how to
create a clipping group, yet another way to blend your
layers by masking your layers to the opaque areas of a
base layer. Don’t worry, it may sound complicated, but it’s
a piece of cake. 

Working with the Cookie Cutter Tool
380
Working with the Cookie Cutter Tool
The Cookie Cutter tool is a cute name for a pretty powerful tool. Think of it
as a Custom Shape tool for images. But, whereas the Custom Shape tool cre-
ates a mask and just hides everything outside the shape, the Cookie Cutter
cuts away everything outside the shape, much like a traditional cookie
cutter does with dough. The preset libraries provide you with a variety of
shapes, from animals and flowers to symbols and faces. 
Here’s how to use the Cookie Cutter:
1. In the Editor, in Full Edit mode, choose the Cookie Cutter tool from
the Tools panel.
The tool icon looks like a star. You can also press the Q key.
2. Specify the following options on the Options bar.
• Shape: Choose a shape from the preset library. To load other
libraries, click the panel pop-up menu and choose one from the 
submenu.
• Shape Options: These options let you draw your shape using certain
parameters:
Unconstrained: The default, Unconstrained, enables you to draw
freely.
Defined Proportions: This option enables you to keep the height and
width proportional.
Defined Size: This choice lets you crop the image to the original,
fixed size of the shape you choose. You can’t make it bigger or
smaller.
Fixed Size: This option allows you to enter your desired width and
height.
From Center: This choice allows you to draw the shape from the
center outward.
• Feather: This option creates a soft-edged selection. 
• Crop: Click this option to crop the image into the shape. The shape
fills the Image window.
3. Click and drag your mouse on the image to create your desired
shape. Size the shape by dragging one of the handles of the bounding
box. Position the shape by placing the mouse cursor inside the box
and dragging.
You can also perform other types of transformations, such as rotating
and skewing. For more on transformations, see Book IV, Chapter 2.

Using the Magic Extractor 381
Take a gander at the Layers panel. Notice the temporary creation of a
Layer Mask icon. See the section “Working with Layer Masks” later in
this chapter for details on layer masks.
4. Click the Commit button on the Options bar and press Enter or
double-click inside the bounding box to complete the cut.
Figure 4-1 shows our image cut into a flower. If you change your mind and
don’t want the cut, click the Cancel button on the Options bar or press Esc.

Using the Magic Extractor 
When you see a name like the Magic Extractor, you may wonder if you have
to do anything at all except utter some mystical incantation to have your
desired element cleanly plucked from its background. Unfortunately, it isn’t
quite that easy, but it’s pretty close. The Magic Extractor command enables
you to make selections based on your identification of the foreground and
background portions of your image. Specify your foreground and back-
ground by clicking these areas with the brush tool and “marking” them.
Click the magic OK button, and your object or objects are neatly and pain-
lessly extracted.

Working with
Masking

Using the Magic Extractor 
382
Although it isn’t mandatory, you can make a rough selection first before
selecting the Magic Extractor command. This technique restricts what is
extracted and can result in a more accurate selection.
Follow these steps to magically extract your element:
1. In the Editor, in Full Edit mode, choose Image➪Magic Extractor.
The Magic Extractor dialog box appears.
2. Choose the Foreground Brush tool from the dialog box and then click
or drag to mark your foreground areas — the areas you want to
select.
The default color of the Foreground Brush is red, as shown in Figure 4-2.
The more accurate the data you provide to the command’s algorithm,
the more accurate your extraction. Be sure to use the Zoom and Hand
tools to help magnify and move around your image as needed. 
You can also change the size of your brush tip (from 1 to 100 pixels) in
the Tool Options area on the right side of the dialog box. If necessary,
change the color of your foreground and background colors by clicking
the swatch and choosing a new color from the Color Picker.
3. Select the Background Brush tool from the dialog box and then click
or drag to mark the background area — the portions you don’t want
to select.
The default color of the Background Brush is blue.

Figure 4-2: Identify foreground and background areas with the Magic Extractor.

Using the Magic Extractor 383
4. Click Preview to view your extraction.
You can change the preview by going to the Preview section of the
Magic Extractor dialog box and choosing either Selection Area or
Original Photo from the Display pop-up menu. 
If you want to see your selection against a different background, choose
one from the Background pop-up list. (A black matte for a black back-
ground would be nice.)
5. If the extraction needs more accuracy, you can refine the selection
with the help of the Magic Extractor tools set, located along the left
side of the dialog box:
• To erase any markings: Select the Point Eraser tool and click or drag
over the offending areas.
• To add areas to the selection: Click or drag over your desired areas
with the Add to Selection tool.
• To delete areas from the selection: Drag with the Remove from
Selection tool.
• To smooth the edges of your foreground selection: Drag over the edges
with the Smoothing Brush tool.
The following editing tricks use options found on the right side of the
dialog box
• To soften the edges of your selection: Enter a value in the Feather box —
the higher the value, the softer the edge.
• To fill a hole: Click the Fill Holes button.
• To remove the halo of pixels between the foreground and background
areas: Click Defringe and enter a value in the Defringe Width box.
If things start to go awry, you can start over by clicking Reset at the
bottom of the dialog box.
6. When you’re pleased with the results, click OK to finish the extrac-
tion process and close the Magic Extractor dialog box.

Selective Erasing with the Eraser Tools
The eraser tools let you erase portions of an image. The three eraser tools
are the regular Eraser, the Magic Eraser, and the Background Eraser, which
all share a fly-out menu in the Tools panel. 
The eraser tools look like real erasers, so you can’t miss them. But just in
case you do, press E and then Shift+E to toggle through the three tools.

Selective Erasing with the Eraser Tools

When you erase pixels, those pixels are gone. For good. Before using the
eraser tools, it might be wise to make a backup of your image. You can save
the image either as a separate file or as another layer. That way, if things run
amuck, you have some cheap insurance.
Using the Eraser tool
The Eraser tool allows you to erase areas on your image. If the image con-
tains just a background, you erase to the background color. If the image is on
a layer, you erase to transparency. Both instances are shown in Figure 4-4.
To use this tool, simply select the image and then click and drag through
your desired area on it, and you’re done. Because it isn’t the most accurate
tool on the planet, remember to zoom way in and use smaller brush tips to
do some accurate erasing.

Figure 4-4: The Eraser tool erases either to the background color (left) 
or, if you are on a layer, to transparency (right).
These options on the Options bar control the Eraser tool:
 Brush Presets: Click the drop-down panel to access the Brush presets.
Choose the brush of your choice. Again, additional brush libraries are
available from the Brushes pop-up menu.
 Size: Click the down-pointing arrow to access the Size slider. Choose
from a brush size between 1 and 2500 pixels.

 Mode: Select from Brush, Pencil, and Block. When you select Brush or
Pencil, you have access to the Brush Preset picker panel on the far left
of the Options bar. When you select Block, you’re stuck with one size (a
16 x 16-pixel square tip). But because the block size remains constant, if
you zoom way in, you can perform some detailed erasing. 
 Opacity: Specify a percentage of transparency for the erased areas. The
lower the Opacity setting, the less it erases. This option isn’t available
for the Block mode.
Selecting and erasing by color
The Magic Eraser tool works like a combination Eraser and Magic Wand
tool. It selects and erases similarly colored pixels simultaneously. Here’s
how it works:
 When you click a layer: The Magic Eraser tool erases pixels of a similar
color based on a specified range and leaves the area transparent, as
shown in Figure 4-5.
 When you click the background: The Magic Eraser tool automatically
converts the background to a layer and then does the same pixel-
erasing thing.
 When you click a layer with locked transparency: The Magic Eraser
tool erases the pixels and replaces the area with the background color.
Corbis Digital Stock
Figure 4-5: Clicking with the Magic Eraser simultaneously selects 
and erases similarly colored pixels.

Selective Erasing with the Eraser Tools
387
Here are the options for the Magic Eraser tool:
 Tolerance: Defines the range of colors that Elements erases, just as it
does with the Magic Wand tool. The value determines how similar a
neighboring color has to be to the color that you click. A higher value
picks up more colors, whereas a lower value picks up fewer colors.
 Anti-Alias: Creates a slightly soft edge around the transparent area.
 Contiguous: Selects only similar colors that are adjacent to each other.
Deselect this option to select and then delete similar-colored pixels
wherever they appear in your image.
 All Layers: Samples colors using data from all visible layers, but erases
pixels on the active layer only.
 Opacity: Works like it does for the regular Eraser tool, described in the
previous section.
Removing the background from an image 
The Background Eraser tool is probably the most sophisticated of the
eraser-tool lot. It erases away the background from an image, and should
leave the foreground untouched. But if you’re not careful in using it, the
Background Eraser tool can erase the foreground and anything else in its
path.
Like the Magic Eraser tool, the Background Eraser tool erases to trans-
parency on a layer. If you drag on the background, Elements converts the
background into a layer.
To use the Background Eraser tool successfully, you need to carefully keep
the crosshair, or hot spot, that appears in the center of the cursor, on the
background pixels while you drag. The hot spot samples the color of the
pixels and deletes pixels of that color wherever they fall under the brush cir-
cumference. But, if you get close to a foreground pixel with the hot spot,
that pixel is gobbled up as well. This tool works better with images that
have good contrast in color between the background and foreground
objects, as shown in Figure 4-6. Also, if your image has very detailed or
wispy edges (such as hair or fur), you’re better off using the Magic Extractor
command, which we described earlier in this chapter.

Here’s the rundown on the options, found on the Options bar, for the
Background Eraser:
 Brush Preset Picker: This option provides various settings to cus-
tomize the size and appearance of your eraser brush tip. The Size and
Tolerance settings at the bottom are for pressure-sensitive drawing
tablets. You can base the size and tolerance on the pen pressure or
position of the thumbwheel.

Working with Layer Masks
389
 Limits: The Contiguous setting erases similar colors that are adjacent to
one another under the brush circumference. The Discontiguous setting
erases similar colors whenever they are under the brush circumference,
regardless whether they are adjacent. 
 Tolerance: Works just like the Magic Eraser Tolerance setting, described
in the previous section.
Working with Layer Masks
Unfortunately, one of the areas where Photoshop has a leg up on Elements is
in the area of layer masks. To create a layer mask in Photoshop, one merely
has to click a button in the Layers panel. To get layer masks in Elements
requires a clever work-around. And fortunately, while it is clever, it is also
very easy to do. But before we get ahead of ourselves and tell you how to
get a layer mask, you may want to know what a layer mask is and why in the
world you would ever need one.
A layer mask is like a second sheet of acetate that hovers over a layer. You
can use layer masks with image layers and adjustment layers. In the case of
an image layer, the layer mask allows you to selectively show, hide, or par-
tially show portions of your image. With adjustment layers, the layer mask
allows you to selectively apply the adjustment to the layers below it. This is
done by painting on a layer mask, with black, white, and various shades of
gray. Any black areas on the mask hide the image or the adjustment, any
white areas show the image or adjustment, and anything in between (gray)
partially shows the image or adjustment, as shown in Figure 4-7. 
Layer masks are excellent for blending layers of images and creating soft
transitions between elements. They allow you to gradually brush in trans-
parency and opacity on a selective pixel basis. You can even apply gradients
and filters to your layer masks to create interesting special effects.
By default, the mask is completely white. This allows the image or adjust-
ment to be fully applied to the layers. If you paint on a layer mask with
black, the areas under those black areas don’t show the image or adjust-
ment. If you paint with a shade of gray, those areas partially show the image
or adjustment. The darker the shade of gray, the less it shows the image or
adjustment. Note that if you have an active selection border in your image
before you add an adjustment layer, the adjustment is applied only to that
area within the selection border. The resulting layer mask also reflects that
selection: The selected areas are white, and the unselected areas are black.

Chapter 4

Figure 4-7: A layer mask uses varying shades of gray to selectively apply 
the adjustment to the underlying layers.
Now comes the clever part. We mentioned in the first paragraph that
Elements doesn’t have a layer mask option in the Layers panel. The only
way to get a layer mask in Elements is to create an adjustment layer. When
you create an adjustment layer, you also create a layer mask on that layer at
the same time. If you don’t need any adjustments and just want the layer
mask, after you create the adjustment layer, just don’t make any adjustment
settings. Then, use the layer mask to blend two layers. 
Just to make things crystal clear, follow the steps to create a layer mask:
1. In the Editor, in Full Edit mode, open, or create your layered image.
2. In the Layers panel, select the bottommost layer of the two layers you
wish to blend.
You want to sandwich the adjustment layers between the two layers
you wish to blend.

Working with Layer Masks
391
3. Choose Layer➪New Adjustment Layer➪Levels. 
You can choose any of the adjustments because you won’t be specifying
any settings. Remember, creating an adjustment layer is the only way to
get the layer mask.
4. Click OK in the New Layer dialog box. 
The Levels dialog box appears. Don’t specify any settings in the dialog
box. Just click OK.
5. Select the topmost layer that you wish to blend in the Layers panel
and then choose Layer➪Group with Previous.
This command creates a clipping group. For a detailed explanation of
clipping groups, see the next section in this chapter.
6. With the painting tool of your choice (we recommend the Brush tool),
paint on your layer mask. 
Apply a foreground color of black where you want to hide the portions of
the topmost layer. Leave the mask white where you want the topmost
layer to show. Adjust the Opacity setting in the Options bar to paint with
a less-opaque black, which is essentially like painting with gray. The
higher the Opacity, the darker the gray and the more it partially hides
the topmost layer. If you want subtle blending between the layers, use a
large feathered brush tip and vary your opacity settings accordingly.
If things start to run amok, just choose Edit➪>Fill and fill your entire
layer mask with white to start again.
Note that you can also use the Gradient tool on the layer mask. Using fore-
ground and background colors of white and black, you can create a nice tran-
sition from showing and hiding the layer, as shown in Figure 4-8. The darker
areas of the gradient gradually hide the image, whereas the lighter areas
gradually show the image. For more on gradients, see Book V, Chapter 2.

Figure 4-8: Layer masks enable you to softly blend two layers.
Creating Clipping Groups
In a clipping group, the bottommost layer (also known as the base layer)
acts as a mask for the layers above it. The layers in the group clip to the
opaque areas of the base layer and don’t show over the transparent areas of
the base layer.
Creating a clipping group works well if you want to fill a shape or some type
with different images on multiple layers.

Creating Clipping Groups
393
Using the steps that follow, we created a new document with a white back-
ground. We then took the Custom Shape tool and created a bird shape on a
second layer. We added two layer styles — a drop shadow and a simple
inner bevel — to the shape for added dimension, but this step isn’t manda-
tory. We then opened an image of some clouds and then dragged and
dropped that image onto our composite. 
Follow these steps to create your own clipping mask:
1. In the Editor, in Full Edit mode, open or create an image that has sev-
eral layers. 
To see best how this technique works, try creating a shape layer for
your base layer. For more on shape layers, see Book V, Chapter 1.
2. Arrange your layers so that your base layer is the bottommost layer. 
See Book VI, Chapter 2 for more on rearranging layers.
3. Hold down Alt (Option on the Mac) and, in the Layers panel, position
your mouse cursor over the line dividing the base layer and the layer
above it.
Your cursor changes to two overlapping circles with a small arrow icon.
You can also choose Layer➪Group with Previous. 
4. Click your mouse button.
Repeat Steps 3 and 4 for any remaining layers you want clipped to the
base layer. Notice how our sky image clips to the base layer (the bird
shape) in the Layers panel (appears indented).
Nothing outside the boundaries of the bird shape is visible on the layer
in the clipping mask, as shown in Figure 4-9. The down-pointing arrow
icon beside the layer on the Layers panel indicates that the layer is
clipped. The clipping group takes on the opacity and blend mode of the
base layer.

A couple other tips to keep in mind when working with clipping groups
include these:
 To remove a layer from the clipping group, you can simply Alt-click
(Option-click on the Mac) the line between the two layers in the Layers
panel. Or you can select the layer and choose Layer➪Ungroup. Both
commands remove the selected layer and any layers above it from the
clipping group.
 You can also apply clipping masks to adjustment and fill layers. If you
clip between a regular layer and an adjustment layer, or a regular layer
and a fill layer, the adjustment or fill layer affects only the pixels of the
adjacent underlying layer, rather than all the underlying layers.

ilters have a long and glorious history, ranging from performing essen-
tial tasks (such as removing abrasive particles from the oil in your car’s
engine) to even more important tasks involving the pixels in your images in
Elements. In both cases, filters (also called plug-ins because they can be
installed and removed independently) take your pixels and manipulate them
in both useful and just frivolous and fun ways. They can correct less-than-
perfect images by making them appear sharper or by covering up flaws. Or
they can enhance your images by making them appear as though they’re
painted, tiled, photocopied, or lit by spotlights. The results are some-
thing to be admired.
This chapter introduces you to the basics of Photoshop’s
filter facilities and starts you on the road to filter 
proficiency.
Understanding Filter Basics
All filters do a simple thing in a seemingly compli-
cated way. Deep within a filter’s innards is a set of
instructions that tells Elements what to do with a
particular pixel in an image or selection. Elements
applies these instructions to each and every pixel in the
relevant area by using a process that the pixelheads call
convolution (creating a form or shape that’s folded or curved
in tortuous windings), but which we normal humans simply refer
to as applying a filter.

Understanding Filter Basics
398
Applying filters
You can apply a filter in three ways:
 In either Full Edit or Quick Fix mode: From the Filter menu, choose
your desired filter category and then select a specific filter.
 In Full Edit mode only: Choose Window➪Effects to open the Effects
panel. Click the Filters button at the top of the panel. Select your filter
category from the drop-down list in the upper-right corner of the panel.
Double-click the thumbnail of your desired filter or drag the filter onto
your Image window.
 In either Full Edit or Quick Fix mode: Choose Filter➪Filter Gallery to
apply one or more filters in a flexible editing environment. The Filter
Gallery is described in the section “Working in the Filter Gallery,” later
in this chapter.
You can’t apply filters to images that are in Bitmap or Index Color mode.
You also can’t apply them to type or shape layers. And some filters don’t
work on images in Grayscale mode. For a refresher on color modes, see
Book III, Chapter 2.
Corrective and destructive filters
Most digital imagers classify filters into two basic categories:
 Corrective filters: Usually used to fix problems in an image. They fine-
tune color, add blur, improve sharpness, or remove such nastiness as
dust and artifacts. Remember, pixels are still being modified; it’s just
that these filters don’t change the basic look of an image. They just
improve it a little. 
Be sure and check out the important techniques of sharpening and blur-
ring, covered in Book VIII, Chapter 2. Sharpening and blurring are the
king and queen of the corrective filters.
 Destructive filters: Tend to obliterate at least some of an image’s origi-
nal detail while they add special effects. They may overlay an image
with an interesting texture, move pixels around to create brush strokes,
or distort an image with twists, waves, or zigzags. You can often tell at a
glance that a destructive filter has been applied to an image: The spe-
cial effect often looks like nothing that exists in real life.
An unaltered image (such as the image on the left in Figure 1-1) can be
improved by using a corrective filter such as Unsharp Mask (center) or
changed dramatically with a destructive filter such as Rough Pastels (right).

Understanding Filter Basics
399
Purestock
Figure 1-1: Filters come in a wide variety from the corrective (center) to the destructive (right).
Single and multistep filters
Whether a filter is corrective or destructive, it falls into one of two camps.
Here they are:
 Single-step filters: The easiest filters to use, single-step filters have no
options and use no dialog boxes. Just select the filter from the menu
and watch it do its stuff on your image or selection. 
 Multistep filters: Most filters come complete with at least one dialog
box, along with (perhaps) a few lists, buttons, and check boxes. And
almost every multistep filter has sliders you can use to adjust the inten-
sity of an effect (see Figure 1-2). These filters are marked in the menus
with an ellipsis (a series of dots) following their names.
The controls themselves are easy to master. The tricky part is figuring out
what the various parameters you’re using actually do. How does changing
brush size affect your image when you’re using a brush-stroke filter? What
happens when you select a particular pattern with a texturizing filter? You
can read descriptions of how various filter controls affect your image, but
your best bet is to simply experiment until you discover the effects and
parameters that work best for you. Just be sure that you save a copy of the
original image; filters do permanent damage to files — modifying, adding,
and deleting pixels.

Reapplying a filter
You can reapply the last filter you
worked with — using the same set-
tings — by pressing Ctrl+F (Ô+F on
the Mac). (It’s also the first command
on the Filter menu.) You might want
to do this to strengthen the effect of a
filter on a particular image, layer, or
selection. Or you simply may want to
apply the same filter to a succession
of images or selections.
To bring up the dialog box for the last
filter you applied, press Ctrl+Alt+F
(Windows) or Ô+Option+F (Mac).
This shortcut can be very useful
when you apply a filter and then
decide you don’t like the results and
want to go back and try different set-
tings. After applying the filter, press Ctrl+Z (Ô+Z on the Mac) to undo, and
then press Ctrl+Alt+F (Ô+Option+F on the Mac) to bring up the filter’s
dialog box. The dialog box opens with the settings you used last time, allow-
ing you to make adjustments and then reapply the filter.
Fading a filter
Sometimes, you don’t want the full effect of a filter applied to your image.
Sometimes, fading a filter a bit softens the effect and makes it look less “dig-
itized,” as shown in Figure 1-3. Here’s what you can do to dial-down a filter:
1. In Full Edit mode, choose Layer➪
Duplicate Layer and then click
OK when the dialog box appears.
2. Make sure your duplicated layer
is selected in the Layers panel
and then apply your desired
filter to the duplicate layer.
We applied a Palette Knife filter.
(You’ll find it under the Artistic 
category.)
3. Use the Blend modes and Opacity
settings located on the Layers
panel to merge the filtered layer
with the original unfiltered image.

We brought our Opacity down to 65%. If you need more details on work-
ing with layers, see Book VI.
4. (Optional) With the Eraser tool, selectively erase portions of your fil-
tered image to enable the unfiltered image to show through.
For example, if you applied a Gaussian Blur filter to soften a harshly lit
portrait, try erasing the blurred portion that covers the subject’s eyes
to let the unblurred eyes of the layer below show through. The sharply
focused eyes provide a natural focal point.
Selectively applying a filter
You don’t need to apply filters to an
entire image or an entire layer. You can
achieve some of the best effects when
you apply a filter to only a portion of
an image — say, to an object in the
foreground, but not on the back-
ground. For example, you can blur a
distracting background so that the
person in your image gets due atten-
tion. Or, as you see in Figure 1-4, we
applied a Twirl filter to the water, 
leaving the girl unfiltered to avoid that
overly “Photoshopped” effect. (Not
surprisingly, you’ll find Twirl under the
Distort category.)
Working in the Filter Gallery
When you apply a filter, you may be presented with a huge dialog box. This
editing window is officially called the Filter Gallery. You can also access it by
choosing Filter➪Filter Gallery. In the flexible Filter Gallery, you can apply
multiple filters, delete them, and edit them to your heart’s content. This fea-
ture has made filters more flexible, more user-friendly, and easier to apply. 
Even when you’re using the Filter Gallery, make a backup copy of your
image — or at least create a duplicate layer — before you apply filters.
Filters change the pixels of an image permanently, and when you exit the
Filter Gallery, the filters that are applied can’t be removed.
Follow these steps to get up-and-running in the Filter Gallery:
1. In either Full Edit or Quick Fix mode, choose Filter➪Filter Gallery.
The Filter Gallery dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 1-5.

The folder expands and displays the filters in that category. A thumb-
nail illustrating the filter’s effect accompanies each filter. To collapse

4. In the rightmost section, specify any settings associated with the
filter.
The preview is updated accordingly.
5. When you’re happy with the filter, click OK in the top-right corner of
the dialog box to apply the filter and exit. But if you want to apply
another filter, leave the dialog box open and proceed to Steps 6, 7,
and 8.

Elements lists each of the filters you apply to the image in the bottom-
right of the dialog box.
8. When you’re done, click OK to apply the second filter and exit the
dialog box.
You can apply as many filters as you want to your image. But, often, less is
more.
Here are some other helpful tips to keep in mind when you’re using the
Filter Gallery:
 To delete an applied filter, select it in the list in the lower right of the
dialog box and click the Delete Effect Layer button (the Trashcan icon)
at the bottom of the dialog box.
 To edit an applied filter’s settings, select it in the list and make any nec-
essary changes. Click OK to reapply. Although you can edit a particular
filter’s settings, that edit affects any subsequent filters you’ve added
after applying that particular filter.
 You can rearrange the order of the applied filters. Simply select and
drag the filter up or down within the list.
Rearranging the order of the filters you are using changes the results of
applying the filters.
 To resize the Filter Gallery dialog box, drag the lower-right corner.
 To hide the Filter menu and provide the maximum real estate for the
preview box, click the arrow to the left of the OK button.
 You can choose any of the filters found in the Filter Gallery from the
Filter menu itself. Choosing a Filter menu filter launches the Filter
Gallery automatically — but not all filters are available in the Filter
Gallery. You have to access some of them individually from the Filter
menu.
Filters change the pixels of an image permanently, and after you apply one,
you can’t remove it. So, be sure that you really like what you’ve done and
that you have a backup copy of that precious family photo or critical project
image.

Having Fun with Filters
Now that you’re familiar with what filters are, how they’re applied, and how
they can be modified and toned down, it’s time to experiment and have
some fun. This is something you can do on your own when you have an
hour or so and some willing images laying around. Create a composite with
multiple layers and apply some filters. Add some different Opacity settings
and Blend modes and you’ve got yourself a party. 
To get your party started, we give you a few tips on a few of our favorite 
filters.
Correcting camera distortion
If you’ve ever tried to capture a skyscraper or other imposing piece of archi-
tecture in the lens of your camera, you know that it often involves tilting your
camera and putting your neck in some uncomfortable position. And then,
after all that, what you end up with is a distorted view of what was an impres-
sive building.The Correct Camera Distortion filter fixes the distorted perspec-
tive created by both vertical and horizontal tilting of the camera. As a bonus,
this filter also corrects other kinds of distortions caused by lens flaws.
Here’s how to fix those lens issues:
1. Choose Filter➪Correct Camera Distortion in either Full Edit or Quick
Fix mode.
2. In the Correct Camera Distortion dialog box, be sure to select the
Preview option, as shown in Figure 1-6.
Figure 1-6: The Correct Camera Distortion filter fixes distortions caused 
by camera tilt and lens flaws.

3. Specify your correction options:
• Remove Distortion: Corrects lens barrel, which causes your images to
appear spherized or bloated. This distortion can occur when you’re
using wide-angle lenses. It also corrects pincushion distortion, which
creates images that appear to be pinched in at the center, a flaw
that’s found when using telephoto or zoom lenses. Slide the slider
while keeping an eye on the preview. Use the grid as your guide for
proper alignment.
• Amount: Adjusts the amount of lightening or darkening around the
edges of your photo that you can sometimes get from incorrect lens
shading. Change the width of the adjustment by specifying a mid-
point value. A lower midpoint value affects more of the image. Then,
move the Amount slider while viewing the preview.
• Vertical Perspective: Corrects the distorted perspective created by
tilting the camera up or down. Again, use the grid to assist in your
correction. We used the Vertical Perspective to correct the building
shown in Figure 1-6.
• Horizontal Perspective: Corrects halos and blurs caused by moving
the camera (or if your subject can’t sit still). For better results, set
the angle of movement under the Angle option.
• Angle: Enables you to rotate the image to compensate for tilting the
camera. You may also need to tweak the angle slightly after correct-
ing the vertical or horizontal perspective.
• Scale: When you correct the perspective on your image, you may be
left with blank areas on your canvas. You can scale your image up or
down to crop into the image and eliminate these “holes.” Note that
scaling up results in interpolating your image up to its original pixel
dimensions. Therefore, if you do this, be sure to start with an image
that has a high-enough pixel dimension or resolution to avoid severe
degradation. 
• Show Grid: Shows and hides the grid, as needed. Choose the color of
your grid lines.
• Zoom: Zooms in and out for your desired view.
4. Click OK to apply the correction and close the dialog box.
The Facet filter
The Facet filter breaks up an image by using a posterizing effect. It gathers
up blocks of pixels that are similar in brightness and converts them to a
single value, using geometric shapes. (When you posterize an image, you
reduce it to a very small number of tones.)
Book VII
Chapter 1
Making Corrections
and Having Fun with
Filters

Having Fun with Filters
406
The geometric shapes make the image
look more randomly produced, while
eliminating much of the banding effect
you get with conventional posterizing
filters.
The effects of the Facet filter are subtle
and best viewed at close range. The
image in Figure 1-7 originally contained
some dust, scratches, and a few other
defects. Instead of retouching them
one by one, we used Facet.
Facet is a single-step filter, so you
don’t need to adjust any controls. Just
choose Filter➪Pixelate➪Facet and
evaluate your results. You can apply
the filter multiple times. However, even
one application smoothes out the pic-
ture and eliminates the worst of the
artifacts.
If you apply the Facet filter multiple
times, your image takes on a kind of
pointillist, stroked look that becomes
more and more obvious. Using the
filter over and over on the same image
can yield quite interesting special
effects.
Getting artsy
Several filters produce great artistic effects. You can find a large collection
of them in the Artistic, Sketch, and Stylize submenus. 
Many users employ these filters to create images that look as if they were
painted. What those users might not tell you, unless pressed, is that filters
can make less than best-quality photos look better. These filters can dis-
guise a multitude of photographic sins, turning shoebox rejects into pretty
decent digital transformations. 
Try out one of the following artistic filters:
 Poster Edges: Gives the picture an artsy, poster-like look, but also
enhances the edges to make the outline of the object appear sharper, as
shown in Figure 1-8.
 Rough Pastels: Gives the look of a fine-art piece created with oil pastels. 
Figure 1-7: The Facet filter can simply
eliminate annoying artifacts or convert
your image into a “painted” piece.

 The Dry Brush: This filter can add an even more stylistic effect, reduc-
ing details down to a series of broad strokes.
 Colored Pencil: This filter crosshatches the edges of your image to
create a pencil-like effect.
 Cutout: This effect assembles an image from what looks like cut-out
paper shapes, which resemble a kid’s art project.
 Film Grain: This photographic effect diffuses an image with thousands
of tiny dots that simulate clumps of film grain. (Think of old home movies.)
 Fresco: This effect looks (supposedly) like pigments applied to fresh,
wet plaster. Okay, we guess . . . if you squint.
 Paint Daubs: This effect uses smears of color from your choice of a half-
dozen different brush types. Very Jackson Pollock.
 Plastic Wrap: This filter can produce a wet look, particularly when you
apply it to a selection and then fade the filter so it doesn’t overpower
the detail in your image.
 Watercolor: This nice pastel effect diffuses an image while adding an
interesting, watery texture.
Stroking your image
The filters under the Brush Strokes submenu try to mimic the appearance of
art created with pen, brush, airbrush, ink, and paint. Here are a few of our
favorites:

Distorting for fun
With a couple exceptions, Element’s Distortion filters twist, turn, and bend
your images in surprising ways, turning ordinary objects into wavy images,
pinched shapes, and bloated spheres.
The first exception? The Diffuse Glow filter distorts images only to the
extent that it imbues them with a soft, romantic, fuzzy look that can make
the sharpest image look positively ethereal, as shown in Figure 1-10.
The Glass filter can add a glass block texture or a frosted-glasslike fuzziness
to your image. Other filters under this submenu produce wavy images, add
pond ripples, pinch images, or transform them into spheres. 
Purestock

Getting noisy
Noise in images consists of any graininess or texture that occurs, either
because of the inherent quality of the image or through the editing process.
Noise filters, such as Add Noise, produce random texture and grain in an
image. If you’re new to image editing, you might wonder why you’d want to
add noise to an image in the first place. Wouldn’t it be smarter to remove it?
Well, sometimes. In practice, you can find a lot of applications that call for a
little noise here and there:
 Adding texture: Objects that become too smooth, either because of
blurring or other image editing you may have done, often look better
Book VII
Chapter 1
Making Corrections
and Having Fun with
Filters

Having Fun with Filters
410
when you add some noise to give them a texture, as shown in Figure
1-11. This technique is particularly useful if one object in an image has
been edited, smoothed, or blurred more than the other objects in the
image.
 Blending foreign objects into a scene: When you drop a new object
into the middle of an existing scene, the amount of grain or noise in the
new object is often quite different from the objects it’s joining.
For example, say you’ve decided to take a photo of your house and
want to insert a certain luxury car in your driveway. Unfortunately, the
photo of your in-law’s car is a lot sharper than the picture of your
house. Adding a little noise can help the two objects blend more realis-
tically. You may even forget that the car isn’t yours.
 Improving image quality: Images that contain smooth gradients often
don’t print well because some printers can’t reproduce the subtle blend
of colors from one hue to another. The result is objectionable banding in
your printed image: You can see distinct stripes where the colors
progress from one to another. Adding a little noise can break up the gra-
dient enough that your printer can reproduce the blend of colors, and
the noise/grain itself is virtually invisible on the printed sheet.
Figure 1-11: Adding some noise can give an image some 
needed texture.

Having Fun with Filters
411
The other filters in the Noise submenu don’t add noise at all; instead, they
make noise and artifacts (flaws, such as the dust and scratches on old film)
less noticeable. 
Breaking your image into pieces
The Pixelate filters break up your images into bits and pieces, providing
more of those painterly effects you can get with brush strokes and artistic
filters. The Pixelate submenu includes the Crystallize filter, shown in Figure
1-12, as well as filters that produce color halftone effects, fragmented
images, and a pointillism effect. 
Purestock

Rendering
In computer lingo, rendering means creating something from a set of instruc-
tions, in a way. That’s why rendering filters all produce special effects by
Book VII
Chapter 1
Making Corrections

creating a look, object, or lighting effect that’s melded with your original
image. Here are a few favorite render filters.
 Clouds: Enables you to create a sky full of clouds using random values
taken from a range between the foreground and background colors, as
shown in Figure 1-13. To create a cloud effect with more contrast, hold
down Alt (Option on the Mac) quickly when choosing the command. If
you don’t like the first set of clouds you get, apply the filter again and
again until you do. If you want a more “realistic” sky, try using a dark
sky blue for your foreground color and a very light blue or white color
for your background color.

Need a quick Web background image? Create a 128-x-128-pixel (or some mul-
tiple of that size) image and apply the Clouds filter. It tiles seamlessly on
your Web page.

413
 Difference Clouds: Use this filter to create puffy objects in the sky (or
foggy clouds at lower levels). The Difference Clouds filter uses image
information to figure the difference in pixel values between the new
clouds and the image they’re joining. The result is a unique cloud effect.
Try applying the filter repeatedly to create a marbleized effect.
 Lens Flare: This filter creates the reflection effect that plagues photog-
raphers when they point their cameras toward a strong light source,
such as the sun. The filter mimics several different kinds of photographic
lenses, giving you useful flares that can spice up concert photos and
add a sunset where none existed. Specify a location for the center of the
flare by clicking the image thumbnail or by dragging the crosshair.
 Lighting Effects: As a sort of photo-studio lighting setup, this filter uses
pixels to do its work. You can set up 16 different lights and manipulate
how they illuminate your photo.
Getting organic with the Sketch filters
If you’ve ever envied people who can crank out a beautiful pen sketch in a
matter of minutes, this is the filter menu for you. The Sketch submenu
includes plenty of traditional media artistic effects, such as Graphic Pen
(shown in Figure 1-14), Conté Crayon, Note Paper, chalk, charcoal, and so
on. Here’s a brief rundown of a few effects that are not quite so traditional:
 Photocopy: Gives that infamous, anachronistic look (dating back to the
days when photocopiers didn’t do a very good job of reproducing
halftone images). Creates areas of black and white with little gray value
when the default foreground and background colors of black and white
are selected.
 Plaster: Creates a look that resembles molten plastic more than it looks
like plaster. The filter uses the foreground and background values to
color the image.
 Stamp: Mimics a rubber or wooden-block stamp.
 Reticulation: Adds texture by reproducing a veritable photographic dis-
aster — the wrinkling of film emulsion that occurs when you move film
from one developing chemical to another that has an extremely different
temperature (think hot developer followed by a bath in cold water). The
highlights look grainy; the shadow areas look thick and goopy.
 Torn Edges: Creates the look of ragged paper and colorizes the image
using the foreground and background colors.
 Water Paper: Creates the look of paint-like daubs on fibrous, wet paper.

Adding texture
Elements lets you add a lot of interesting textures to your image, such as
the cracked canvas effect generated by the Craquelure filter (see Figure
1-15) or the pixel effect produced by the Patchwork filter.
You can find other filters on this menu to help you create mosaic effects,
add yet another kind of film grain, and create stained-glass effects in your
images. But the most versatile filter in this set is surely the Texturizer,
which enables you to apply various kinds of textures to your images or
selections, including Canvas, Sandstone, Burlap, or Brick.

side, or any of the four corners of the image.

Putting It Together
Creating an Angelic Glow
Sometimes, a little blur can add a soft, romantic mood or angelic glow that can improve
glamour photos, pictures of kids, or even something as mundane as a flower. The secret
is to apply only enough blurring to provide the soft effect you want without completely
obliterating your original subject. This assumes, of course, that your subject doesn’t
deserve obliteration, that the kids are your own (or those of a close friend or relative),
and that they are, in fact, of that rare angelic variety.
You don’t want to use this effect on other subjects, such as men, who generally like a
rugged, masculine appearance. Many senior citizens regard the age lines on their faces
as badges of distinction earned over a long, rewarding life. Don’t try softening them up
with glowing effects, either.
To add an angelic glow to your little angel, just follow these steps:
1. In Full Edit mode, open your desired image.

2. Choose Layer➪Duplicate Layer to create a copy of the image layer.
3. With the duplicate layer selected in the Layers panel, select
Filter➪Blur➪Gaussian Blur.
Gaussian Blur softens the upper layer, producing an airy glow.
4. Move the Radius slider to the right to produce a moderate amount of blur and then
click OK to apply the blurring effect, as shown in the figure.
We used a value of 7.
5. In the Layers panel, select Lighten from the Modes pop-up menu.
6. Use the Opacity slider (click the right-pointing arrow to access the slider) to
reduce the amount of glow (if it’s too much for your tastes).
We reduced the Opacity to 70 percent.
7. Choose Layer➪Flatten Image to combine all the layers.
Experiment with different amounts of Gaussian Blur until you find the perfect glow-
ing effect, as we did in our figure.

 Understanding the options
 Liquifying an image
L
iquify is the only Elements filter that garners a chapter of its own. That’s
because Liquify is not your run-of-the-mill filter. Truth be told, it is the
ultimate distortin’ fool, with a bevy of tools, modes, and options that make
it a good deal more complex than most of its kin on the Filter menu. The
Liquify filter lets you push and pull on parts of your image, twist, turn, and
pinch other parts, and bloat and reflect yet others. You can basically manip-
ulate an image as though it were pliable saltwater taffy. And although this
would be worthwhile entertainment on its own, you can actually use the
Liquify filter to perform some productive tasks. Pick up any fashion maga-
zine and we guarantee you that many of images of models and celebrities
you see there have made their way through the Liquify filter for nips, tucks,
and overall body sculpting. Yes, even those blessed with natural beauty
are given a dose of digital beautification for good measure.
Exploring the Liquify Window
At first glance, the Liquify window is a little daunt-
ing. It’s a little daunting on second, third, and fourth
glances, too. But when you quit glancing and dive
into this versatile filter, you find that the tools and
options make a lot of sense.
You open the Liquify window by choosing
Filter➪Distort➪Liquify. The Liquify Tools panel
appears on the left, as shown in Figure 2-1. The other
options available with Liquify appear on the right side of
the window. The Tools panel includes a dozen tools that you
can use to paint and distort your image.

Exploring the Liquify Window
418
As with Elements’s main Tools panel, you can activate each tool by pressing
a keyboard shortcut letter associated with its name.
Figure 2-1: The Liquify window is really quite user-friendly after you 
get familiar with its tools and settings.
The distortion painting tools
The first group of tools is used to paint distortions on your image. Here’s a
description of each tool, with its keyboard shortcut in parentheses. To see
what the tool icon looks like, refer back to Figure 2-1. To see what each tool
does to pixels, check out Figure 2-2:
 Warp (W): This tool is faintly reminiscent of the Smudge tool, but it
doesn’t obliterate details in the pixels quite as much as it pushes them
forward while you drag, creating a stretched effect. Use the Warp tool to
push pixels where you want them to go, using short strokes or long
pushes. This is the main tool to use when you want to body-sculpt the
person in an image.
 Turbulence (T): This tool adds a random jumbling effect to pixels when
you click and hold down the mouse button. It acts similarly to the Warp
tool when you click and drag. Adjust how smooth the effect is by dragging 

Exploring the Liquify Window
419
the Turbulent Jitter slider in the Tool Options area. The higher the
value, the smoother the effect. You can use the Turbulence tool to
create maelstroms of air, fire, and water with clouds, flames, and waves.
 Twirl Clockwise (R) and Twirl Counterclockwise (L): Place the cursor
in one spot, press the mouse button, and watch the pixels under your
brush rotate like a satellite photo of a tropical storm. Or drag the cursor
to create a moving twirl effect. Pixels move faster in the center than
along the edges of the brush.
Try this technique with the other tools we describe in this list (with
some tools, the effect is more obvious than with others). Simply hold
down the mouse button. The longer you hold it down, the more promi-
nent the effect becomes.
 Pucker (P): This tool is the equivalent of the Pinch filter, squishing
pixels toward the center of the area covered by the brush while you
hold down the mouse button or drag. To reverse the pucker direction,
which essentially applies a bloat, hold down the Alt key (Option key on
the Mac) while you hold down the mouse button or drag.
 Bloat (B): Think of this tool as a kind of Spherize filter, pushing pixels
toward the edge of the brush area while you hold down the mouse
button or drag the mouse. To reverse the bloat direction — doing so
applies a pucker — hold down the Alt key (Option key on the Mac)
while you hold down the mouse button or drag.
 Shift Pixels (S): This odd tool moves pixels to the left when you drag
the tool straight up. Drag down to move pixels to the right. Drag clock-
wise to increase the size of the object being distorted. Drag counter-
clockwise to decrease the size. To reverse any of the directions, hold
down the Alt key (Option key on the Mac) while you hold down the
mouse button or drag.
 Reflection (M): This tool drags a reversed image of your pixels at a 
90-degree angle to the motion of the brush. Hold down the Alt key (Option 
key on the Mac) to force the reflection in the direction opposite the
motion of the brush (for example, to the left of a brush moving right, or
above a brush moving down). This tool is a good choice for making
reflections on water.

The other tools
The three remaining tools on the panel help with undoing distortions you
may no longer want and also with navigation. These tools (shown here with
their keyboard shortcuts) are
 Reconstruct (R): This is a variation on the old standby Undo. It lets you
reverse or alter — completely or partially — the distortions you’ve
made. You can retrace your steps if you went overboard in your distor-
tion activities.
 Hand (H): The Hand tool works exactly like the standard Elements Hand
tool. Click and drag the image to move it around within the Preview
window. You can find more about the Hand tool in Book I, Chapter 2.
 Zoom (Z): This tool works exactly like the Elements Zoom tool, which
zooms you in and out. Just click the image to zoom in. Hold down the
Alt key (Option key on the Mac) and click to zoom out. You can also
zoom by selecting a magnification percentage (from 6 to 1600 percent)
from the pop-up list in the lower-left corner of the dialog box. Or, if you
like buttons, click your way to magnification by using the +/– zoom con-
trol buttons. See Book I, Chapter 2, for more on using the Zoom tool.
The Options Area
On the right side of the Liquify window (refer to Figure 2-1), you can find
some menus and buttons that let you specify options for the tools. We point
them out to you here and cover how to use them in the rest of this chapter:
 Brush Size: Specifies the width of the brush.
 Brush Pressure: Specifies the speed at which you distort while you
drag. The lower the value, the slower the distortion is applied.
 Turbulent Jitter: Determines how tightly the brush jumbles pixels.
When you use the Turbulence tool, this option gives the stroke a more
natural, organic look.
 Stylus Pressure: If you’re lucky enough to have a graphics tablet and
stylus, click this option to select the pressure of the stylus, which then
controls the width of your brush stroke.

Liquify is as easy to apply as finger paint after you play with it a little. Here’s
a step-by-step scenario of the things you might do to apply some distortion
to your own image:
1. Select and open an image you want to transmogrify in the Editor, in
either Full Edit or Quick Fix mode. 
2. In the Layers panel, select a layer. If you don’t want to distort the
whole layer, you can select part of it.

6. If you take the distortions a little too far, select the Reconstruct tool
to partially or fully reverse or modify your distortions.
Note that the reconstruction occurs faster at the center of the brush’s
diameter. To partially reconstruct your image, set a low brush pressure
and watch closely while the mouse drags across the distorted areas.
7. Apply the distortion to your image by clicking OK and exiting the
Liquify dialog box.
If you mucked up things and want to start again, click the Revert button to
get the original, unaltered image back. This action also resets the tools to
their previous settings. Figure 2-5 shows the Before (and the Extreme After)

fter you have all the basic elements lined up in your layered composite
image, you may want to give it a little pizazz. Elements provides a lot of
different effects that you can apply to enhance your images. Maybe a head-
line would pop out a little more if you beveled the edge, or maybe that sil-
houetted image would take on a little more dimension if you placed a drop
shadow behind it. This chapter is where you find out how to do all these
things.

The upcoming sections explain how to

into a hefty discussion about filters in
Book VII, Chapter 1.
Enhancing with 
Photo Effects
Elements provides a variety of photo
effects that you can apply to your
photos. Note that some effects auto-
matically create a duplicate of the
selected layer, whereas other effects
work only on flattened images. You
can’t preview how the effect will look
on your image or type, as you can
when you apply filters. Also, you have
no options to specify.
Here are the steps to follow when applying a photo effect:
1. In the Editor in Full Edit mode, select your desired image layer in the
Layers panel.
Or, if you’re applying the effect to only a single a selection, make the
selection before applying the effect.
2. Choose Window➪Effects.
3. In the Effects panel, select the Photo Effects button (blue screen with
white dots around it) at the top. (Refer to Figure 3-1.)

4. Select your desired subcategory, or library, of Photo Effects from the
drop-down list in the upper-right area of the panel:
• Frame: Includes photo effects that enhance the edges of the layer or
selection.
• Faded Photo, Monotone Color, Old Photo, and Vintage Photo: This
group of photo effects makes your image fade from color to
grayscale, appear as a single color, or look like an old pencil sketch
or a photo on old paper.
• Misc Effects: This group includes a wide variety of effects to make
your image appear as though it’s snowing, made of lizard skin or
neon tubes, or painted with oil pastels.
• Show All: Shows all the photo effects described in this list.
5. On the Effects panel, double-click an effect or drag the effect onto the
image.
In our example, in Figure 3-2, we
applied the Oil Pastel photo effect
in the Misc Effects library.
You can also apply a photo effect to
type. Select a type layer in the Layers
panel and follow Steps 2–5 in the pre-
ceding list. Note that a dialog box
alerts you that the type layer must be
simplified before the effect can be
applied. Remember that simplifying
the layer means the text can no longer
be edited, so be sure your type is
exactly as you want it. For more on
working with type layers, see Book V,
Chapter 3.
Unlike layer styles, note that photo
effects can’t be edited. Photo effects
automatically create another layer, 
so if you don’t care for the effect,
simply delete that layer by dragging 
it to the trashcan at the top of the
Layers panel.

Working with layer styles
Layer styles range from simple shadows and bevels to more-complex
designs, such as buttons and patterns. The wonderful thing about layer
styles is that they’re completely nondestructive. Unlike filters, layer styles
don’t change your pixel data. You can edit them or even delete them if
you’re unhappy with the results, so feel free to use them with abandon.
Here are a few fun facts about layer styles:
 Layer styles can be applied only to layers. Therefore, if all you have in
your image is a background, be sure to convert it to a layer first. See
Book VI for details on working with layers.
 Layer styles are dynamically linked to the contents of a layer. If you
move or edit the contents of the layers, the results are updated.
 When you apply a layer style to a layer, an fx symbol appears next to
the layer’s name on the Layers panel. Double-click the fx to bring up
the Styles Settings dialog box and make any adjustments that are neces-
sary to get the look you want.
 Layer styles are stored in different libraries. You can add shadows,
glows, beveled and embossed edges, and more-complex appearances,
such as neon, plastic, chrome, and other manmade textures. See Figure
3-3 for a layer style sampler.
 Delete a layer style or styles. Choose Layer➪Layer Style➪Clear Layer
Style or drag the fx icon on the Layers panel to the trashcan in the
panel.
 Copy and paste layer styles onto other layers. Select the layer contain-
ing the layer style and choose Layer➪Layer Style➪Copy Layer Style.
Select the layer or layers on which you want to apply the effect and
choose Layer➪Layer Style➪Paste Layer Style. You can also just drag
and drop an effect from one layer to another while holding down the Alt
key (the Option key on the Mac).
 Hide or show layer styles. Choose Layer➪Layer Style➪Hide All Effects
or Show All Effects.
 Scale a layer style. Choose Layer➪Layer Style➪Scale Effects. Select
Preview and enter a value between 1 and 1,000 percent. This allows you
to scale the style without scaling the element.

2. Choose Window➪Effects.
3. Select the Layer Styles button (an icon of two overlapping screens) at
the top of the Effects panel. (Refer to Figure 3-1.)
4. Select a library of styles from the drop-down list in the upper-right
area of the panel:
• Bevels: Adds a three-dimensional edge on the outside or inside
edges of the contents of a layer, giving the element some dimension.
Emboss styles make elements appear as though they’re raised off or
punched into the page. You can change the appearance of these
styles, depending on the type of bevel chosen. Adjust attributes,
such as the lighting angle, distance (how close the shadow is to the
layer contents), size, bevel direction, and opacity.
• Drop and Inner Shadows: Add a soft drop or inner shadow to a layer.
Choose from an ordinary shadow or one that includes noise, neon,
or outlines. You can adjust the lighting angle, distance, size, and
opacity, as desired.
• Outer and Inner Glows: Add a soft halo that appears on the outside
or inside edges of your layer contents. Adjust the appearance of the
glow by changing the lighting angle, size, and opacity of the glow.
• Visibility: Click Show, Hide, or Ghosted to either display, hide, or par-
tially show the layer contents. The layer style remains fully displayed.
• Complex and others: The remaining layer styles are a group of differ-
ent effects ranging from simple glass buttons to the more exotic
effects, such as Groovy and Rose Impressions. You can customize all
these layer styles somewhat by adjusting the various settings, which
are similar to those for other styles in this list.
5. On the Effects panel, double-click a layer style or drag the layer style
onto the image.
The style, with its default settings, is applied to the layer. Note that layer
styles are cumulative. You can apply multiple styles — specifically, one
style from each library — to a single layer.
Note that you can also apply layer styles to type layers, and the type
layer doesn’t need to be simplified. This is an advantage over Photo
Effects because it enables you to retain the type’s editability, as shown
in Figure 3-4.
Editing layer styles
Layer styles are very agreeable. Not only are they easy to apply, they are
equally easy to edit. Here’s how:

Figure 3-4: Layer styles are advantageous because they don’t alter your pixels.
1. In the Layers panel, double-click
the Layer Style icon (fx icon).
The Style Settings dialog box
opens, as shown in Figure 3-5. 
2. Be sure to check Preview so you
can view how your edits are
affecting the layer style.
3. Expand the options for any layer
style category by clicking the
arrow just to the left of the layer
style name.
Note that you can toggle the layer
style on and off by checking and
unchecking the style.
4. Depending on what category of
layer styles you used, your set-
tings may vary some. Here is a
rundown:
• Lighting Angle: Specify the
angle of your light source. If
you’ve decided to put together
a realistic composite of a
number of different images,
make sure that all the shadows
and highlights of all the differ-
ent elements are consistent.
You don’t want one layer to
look like it’s 6 a.m. and another
to look like it’s 2 p.m.
• Size: Specify the size of your shadow, glow, bevel, or stroke from 0 to
250 pixels.

Putting It Together
Adding Photo Effects and Layer Styles to a Collage
If you like your images and text simple and unadorned, more power to you. But if you feel
a sudden urge to add an embellishment or two, make sure you’re prepared to do that. In
this exercise, we show you how to add some type to a collage and apply effects and
styles to the various elements. Just follow these simple steps:
1. In the Editor, in Full Edit mode, open a previously created and saved collage file.
Make sure that the Layers panel is also open.
2. Select the Eyedropper tool from the Tools panel. Click a color in the collage that
you like.
The color you sampled is now the foreground color, as you can see from your
swatches at the bottom of the Tools panel.
Seeing What the Effects Panel Can Do
432
• Distance: Adjust how far the shadow or glow is offset (0 to 30,000
pixels) from your element.
• Opacity: Adjust the Opacity setting to change how transparent the
shadow, glow, or stroke appears — from 0% to 100%.
• Inner/Outer: Specify whether your glow is an inner or outer glow.
• Color: Click the color swatch and choose a glow color from the Color
Picker. Click OK to close the Color Picker dialog box.
• Direction Up/Direction Down: Specify whether your bevel (the raised
or sunken-in edge) direction is up or down. Direction Up positions
the highlight along the edge closest to the light source and the
shadow on the opposite edge. Direction Down does the opposite,
positioning the shadow near the light source.
5. After you refine your layer style settings, click OK.
The layer style is edited and ready to go, as shown in Figure 3-6. Note
that there are also options for Reset, to start over; or Cancel, to bail out
entirely.

3. Select the Type tool and then select a font, style, point size, and other formatting
options from the Options bar.
We recommend choosing an easy-to-read font and applying a bold style to it. We’re
using Times New Roman Bold, and we set the point size to 30 and the leading to 24
points.
We checked the Anti-Aliasing option so that our text transitions nicely with the image
elements.
4. Click inside the image and type some text.
We typed Organic Gardening for our garden collage. We also added a second line of
text with the day and time.
5. Select the Move tool from the Tools panel and position the type in the collage.
We put the text in the bottom-left corner.

6. With the type layer selected in the Layers panel, choose Window➪Effects. In the
Effects panel, click the Layer Styles icon at the top and choose Drop Shadows from
the library drop-down list. Double-click the Low drop shadow.
If you need to edit the layer style, double-click the fx icon in the Layers panel and
specify settings. For details on how to do this, see the earlier section “Editing layer
styles.” We edited the drop shadow to make it a little smaller in size, less opaque,
and closer to the type.
7. Next, choose Bevels from the library drop-down list. Double-click the Simple Inner
bevel. Make any necessary edits to the bevel layer style.
We reduced the size of our bevel to make the effect crisper.
8. Repeat Steps 6 and/or 7 on any other of your layers, if desired.
We added a Low drop shadow to our trowel and dirt pile layer.
9. Now to add an effect. In the Effects panel, click the Photo Effects icon at the top
and choose Misc Effects from the library drop-down list. Double-click the Soft Flat
Color effect.
10.Choose File➪Save.
You’re all done. If you feel like it, keep adding to or refining the collage when you
discover new tricks.

lmost every photo you take needs a little
polish before you share or print it. In this
book, we talk about the automated features in
Elements that help you quickly adjust brightness
and color, and we cover many advanced image-
correction features.
If you have some photos that were taken with poor
lighting, have low contrast, or are a little bit fuzzy,
this book can help you resurrect some images you
thought were destined for the waste bin.

 Cropping and straightening images
 Using one-step auto fixes
 Editing with Quick Fix
 Cloning realistically
 Healing wrinkles, spots, and blemishes
 Fixing small flaws
O
ne of Elements’ strongest assets is the capability to fix images quickly,
painlessly, and effectively. When you work with digital imaging, you
find that cropping away unwanted clutter, cloning an image with a shadow,
adjusting the color or contrast of a photo, or eliminating flaws from that
otherwise perfect portrait are all fixes that you can do successfully what-
ever your skill level. With these simple image-makeover tools, Elements
makes these tasks as easy to perform as clicking a button or making a few
swipes with a brush.
Cropping an Image
Even a novice photographer knows that cropping an
image can make a composition stronger. Cropping cuts
away background clutter or empty space in order to
focus in on a certain subject.
This simple process can transform a mediocre
image into an interesting and even exciting one.
Take a look at our example in Figure 1-1. It doesn’t
take a pro photographer to figure out which image
is better composed. 

Cropping an Image
440
Figure 1-1: Cropping is one of the easiest ways to improve the 
composition of your image.
Cutting away with the Crop tool
The most popular way to crop an image is by using the Crop tool. This
simple tool is as easy and effective to use as a ruler and an X-ACTO 
a

knife — without the possibility of slicing any fingers. Here’s how to use this
popular tool:
1. In the Editor, in either Quick Fix or Full Edit mode, select the Crop
tool. Or, you can press the C key.
2. Specify your aspect ratio options on the Options bar.
Here are your choices:
• No Restriction: Allows you to freely crop the image at any size.
• Use Photo Ratio: Retains the original aspect ratio of the image when
you crop.
• Preset Sizes: Offers a variety of common photographic sizes. When
you crop, your image assumes those specific dimensions.
When you crop an image, Elements retains the original resolution of
the file. Therefore, to keep the image at the same resolution while
also eliminating portions of the image, Elements must resample the
file. Consequently, your image must have sufficient resolution so
that the effects of the resampling aren’t too noticeable. This is espe-
cially true if you’re choosing a larger preset size. Be sure to see 
Book III, Chapter 1 for more details on resolution.
• Width and Height: Enables you to specify a width and height to crop
your image.
3. With the Crop tool, click and drag around the part of the image you
want to keep and then release your mouse button.
While you drag, a marquee (a dotted outline) bounding box appears,
displaying the cropping boundaries. Don’t worry if your cropping mar-
quee isn’t exactly correct. You can adjust it in Step 4.
The area outside the cropping marquee appears darker than the inside
in order to better frame your image. Adobe calls this a shield. If you
want to change the color and opacity of the shield, or if you don’t want
it at all, change your Crop preferences. (Choose Edit➪Preferences➪
Display & Cursors; on the Mac, choose Elements➪Preferences➪Display
& Cursors.)
Figure 1-2 shows a great example of way too much background clutter.
We dragged around the only thing we wanted to retain.

4. Adjust the cropping marquee by dragging the handles of the crop
marquee bounding box.
The small squares on the sides and corners of the cropping marquee
are called handles. When you hover your mouse over any handle or
over the marquee itself, your cursor changes to a double-headed arrow,
indicating that you can drag.
To move the entire marquee, position your mouse inside the marquee
until you see a black arrowhead cursor and then drag. Adjust the mar-
quee until you’re satisfied.
You can also drag the origin point (the circle icon in the center) to
change the axis of rotation.

If you move your mouse outside
the marquee, the cursor changes
to a curved, double-headed arrow.
Dragging with this cursor rotates
the marquee. This feature can be
extremely useful to rotate and crop
a crooked image. By using the Crop
tool, you can perform both com-
mands in one step quickly and
accurately. Just be aware that rota-
tion, unless it’s in 90-degree incre-
ments, resamples your image. If
this is done repeatedly, it can
damage your image. Getting the
rotation right the first time is best.
5. Double-click inside the cropping
marquee.
You can also just press Enter or
click the green Commit button
next to the marquee. Elements
then discards the area outside 
the marquee, as shown in Figure
1-3. To cancel your crop, click 
the red Cancel button or press 
the Esc key. 
Cropping with a selection
border
If you get bored using the Crop tool,
you can also crop a selected area by choosing Image➪Crop in either
Full Edit or Quick Fix mode. Simply make a selection with any of the tools
and then choose this command. Although it makes the most sense to use
the Rectangular Marquee tool for your selection, you don’t have to.
You can use Image➪Crop with any selection — round, polygonal, free form,
even feathered. Elements can’t crop to those odd shapes, but it gets as close
to the outline as it can, as shown in Figure 1-4.

Straightening Images

Straightening Images
Strive to capture a straight horizon in your photo. You don’t want people to
feel like the water is going to pour right out of your frame in that shot of the
beach or sailboat. Or, maybe when you scanned a photo, it wasn’t quite cen-
tered in the middle of the scanning bed. No worries. Elements gives you sev-
eral ways to straighten an image.
Using the Straighten tool
This tool enables you to specify a new straight edge, and it then rotates the
image accordingly. Here’s how to use the Straighten tool:
1. With the Editor in Full Edit mode, select the Straighten tool from the
Tools panel (or press the P key).
2. Specify your desired setting from the Canvas Options on the 
Options bar.
Here are your choices:
• Grow or Shrink Canvas to Fit: Rotates the image and increases or
decreases the size of the canvas to fit the image area.

Straightening Images
445
• Crop to Remove Background: Trims off background canvas outside
the image area. This is helpful if you want to remove white areas that
appear around an image when you scan it.
• Crop to Original Size: Rotates your image without trimming any back-
ground canvas.
3. (Optional) Select Rotate All Layers.
If you have an image with layers and you want all of them rotated, select
this option.
4. Using the Straighten tool, draw a line in your image to represent the
new straight edge, as shown in Figure 1-5.
Your image is then straightened and, if you chose either of the crop
options in Step 2, also cropped.
Figure 1-5: Straighten your image.
Using the Straighten menu commands
In addition to using the Straighten tool, you can straighten your images by
using two commands on the Image menu in either Full Edit or Quick Fix mode:
 To automatically straighten an image without cropping: Choose
Image➪Rotate➪Straighten Image. This method of straightening leaves
the canvas around the image.
 To automatically straighten and crop the image simultaneously:
Choose Image➪Rotate➪Straighten and Crop Image.

Using the Divide Scanned Photos Command
446
Using the Divide Scanned Photos Command
The Divide Scanned Photos command is fabulous if you want to save time
by scanning multiple images initially into one document (and the command
works on single images, as well). This command is a real manual-labor time-
saver, and we endorse it. Position all the photos you can on your scanning
bed and get one initial scan. Just make sure that a clear separation exists
between all the images. Then, choose Image➪Divide Scanned Photos in
either Full Edit or Quick Fix mode. Elements divides the images and places
each one in a separate file, as shown in Figure 1-6. Note that if you have
images with a lot of white in them, such as snow, you should cover the scan-
ner with a piece of dark paper to better delineate the boundaries of each
image.
Figure 1-6: The Divide Scanned Photos command extracts and straightens your images 
into separate files.

Applying One-Step Auto Fixes

Applying One-Step Auto Fixes
Elements has five automatic lighting-, contrast-, and color-correction tools
that can quickly improve the look of your images with a single menu com-
mand. These commands are available in either Full Edit or Quick Fix mode,
and they’re all on the Enhance menu. 
What is great about these auto fixes is that they’re very easy to use. You
don’t need to know a heck of a lot about color or contrast to use them. The
not-so-good news is that sometimes the result of these auto fixes isn’t as
good as you could get via a manual color-correction method. And some-
times these fixes may even make your image look worse than before by
giving you strange shifts in color. But because these correctors are quick
and easy — and easily undone — they are worth a try. Usually, you don’t
want to use more than one of the auto fixes. If one doesn’t work on your
image, just remember you can undo the fix and try another. If you still don’t
like the result, move on to one of the manual methods that we describe in
Book VIII, Chapter 2.
Auto Smart Fix
This all-in-one command attempts to adjust it all. It’s designed to improve
lighting, improve the details in shadow and highlight areas, and correct the
color balance, as shown in Figure 1-7. The overexposed image on the left
was improved with the Auto Smart Fix command.
Figure 1-7: Apply the Auto Smart Fix command to quickly improve an image overall.

Quick Image
Makeovers

Applying One-Step Auto Fixes
448
The Auto Smart Fix command, as well as the Auto Color, Auto Levels, Auto
Contrast, Auto Sharpen, and Auto Red Eye Fix, are available in the Organizer
(under the Fix pane), where you can apply the commands to several
selected images simultaneously.
If the Auto Smart Fix didn’t quite cut it, you can ramp it up and try Adjust
Smart Fix. This command is similar to Auto Smart Fix, but gives you a slider
that allows you to control the amount of correction applied to the image.
Auto Levels
The Auto Levels command adjusts the overall contrast of an image. This
command works best on images that have pretty good contrast (detail in
the shadow, highlight, and midtone areas) to begin with and just need a
little adjustment; but it can also work wonders for seemingly unsalvageable
images, as shown in Figure 1-8. Auto Levels works by mapping, or convert-
ing, the lightest and darkest pixels in your image to black and white, which
makes highlights appear lighter and shadows appear darker.
Figure 1-8: Auto Levels adjusts the overall contrast of an image.
Although Auto Levels can improve your contrast, it may also produce an
unwanted colorcast (a slight trace of color). If this happens, undo the com-
mand and try the Auto Contrast command instead. If that still doesn’t
improve the contrast, try the Levels command that we describe in Book VIII,
Chapter 2.
Auto Contrast
The Auto Contrast command is designed to adjust the overall contrast in an
image without adjusting its color. This command may not do as good a job of
improving contrast as the Auto Levels command, but it does a better job of
retaining the color balance of an image. Auto Contrast usually doesn’t cause
the strange colorcasts that can occur when you’re using Auto Levels. This
command works really well on images with a haze, as shown in Figure 1-9.

Applying One-Step Auto Fixes
449
Figure 1-9: The Auto Contrast command clears up hazy images.
Auto Color Correction
The Auto Color Correction command adjusts both the color and contrast of
an image, based on the shadows, midtones, and highlights it finds in the
image and a default set of values. These values adjust the number of black
and white pixels that Elements removes from the darkest and lightest areas
of the image. You usually use this command to remove a colorcast or to bal-
ance the color in your image, as shown in Figure 1-10. Sometimes, this com-
mand can be useful in correcting oversaturated or undersaturated colors.

Auto Sharpen
Sometimes photos taken with a digital camera or scanned on a flatbed scan-
ner can appear soft, meaning slightly out of focus. Sharpening gives the illu-
sion of increased focus by increasing the contrast between pixels. Auto
Sharpen attempts to improve the focus, as shown in Figure 1-11, without
going too far. What happens when you oversharpen? Your images go from
soft to grainy and noisy. Always make sharpening the last fix after you make
all other fixes and enhancements. You don’t want to sharpen nasty flaws
and make them even more noticeable than they already are. For more 
accurate sharpening methods, see the Unsharp Mask and Adjust Sharpness
features discussed in Book VIII, Chapter 2.
Figure 1-11: Use Auto Sharpen to improve focus.
Auto Red Eye Fix
The Auto Red Eye Fix command automatically detects and eliminates red-
eye in an image. Red-eye occurs when a person or animal (where red-eye
can also be yellow-, green-, or even blue-eye) looks directly into the flash.
Many cameras have a red-eye prevention mode, which is a pre-flash that
causes the subjects’ irises to contract, making their pupils smaller when the
real flash goes off. Other cameras mount the flash high or to side of the
lens, which also minimizes the chance of red-eye. However, these preven-
tive measures are of little solace when you have a great picture that features
bright red pupils as its dominant feature.

Applying One-Step Auto Fixes
451
Using the Red Eye Removal tool
If for some reason the Auto Red Eye Fix doesn’t correct the problem, you
can always try the Red Eye Removal tool on the Tools panel. Here’s how to
remove red-eye manually:
1. Select the Red Eye Removal tool from the Tools panel in the Editor in
Full Edit mode.
Note that this tool is also available in Quick Fix mode under the new
Touch Up pane in the Fixes panel on the right.
2. Using the default settings, click the red portion of the eye in your
image. 
This one-click tool darkens the pupil while retaining the tonality and
texture of the rest of the eye, as shown in Figure 1-12.
Figure 1-12: The Auto Red Eye Fix and the Red Eye Removal tool detect and destroy
dreaded red-eye.
3. If you’re unhappy with the fix, adjust one or both of these options:
• Pupil Size: Use the slider to increase or decrease the size of the
pupil.
• Darken Pupil: Use the slider to darken or lighten the color of the
pupil.
If all goes well, your image is now cured of the dreaded red eye. (Refer
to the image on the right in Figure 1-12.)
Note that you also use the Brush tool with a Color blend mode and paint
away the red. Or you can use the Color Replacement tool with a black fore-
ground to color away the crimson. If you’re trying to fix green-eye in ani-
mals, your best bet is to use the Color Replacement tool.

Editing with Quick Fix Mode
It turns out that, if you master the Auto Fixes that we cover in the preceding
sections while working in Quick Fix mode, you probably already have all the
tools you need to repair and enhance your images. This means you rarely
have to visit Full Edit mode. Given the power and flexibility of Quick Fix
mode, then, we’re going to devote an entire section to it. 
As you’ve probably already figured out by now, Quick Fix mode is a pared-
down version of Full Edit mode that provides basic image-correcting tools
and throws in a few unique features — such as a before-and-after preview of
your image — for good measure. To get a general idea how Quick Fix mode
works, take a look at the following step-by-step workflow, which shows you
how you’d put Quick Fix mode to use to fix your photos:
1. Do one of the following:
• In the Organizer (for Windows users), select one or more photos.
Click Fix in the upper-right of the Application window, and then click
the Quick Fix button in the panel below.
• In Full Edit mode, select your desired image(s) from the Photo Bin.
Click the Quick button in the upper-right area of the Application
window.
• In Full Edit mode, open your desired images by choosing File➪Open.
Click the Quick button in the upper-right area of the Application
window.
2. Specify your preview preference from the View pop-up menu at the
bottom of the Application window.
You can choose to view just your original image (Before Only), your
fixed image (After Only), or both images side-by-side (Before & After) in
either portrait (Vertical) or landscape (Horizontal) orientation, as
shown in Figure 1-13.
3. Use the Zoom and Hand tools to magnify and navigate around your
image.
You can also specify the Zoom percentage by using the Zoom slider at
the bottom of the Application window.
4. Crop your image by using the Crop tool on the Tools panel.
You can also use any of the methods we describe in the “Cropping an
Image” section, earlier in this chapter.
5. To rotate the image in 90-degree increments, click the Rotate Left or
Rotate Right button at the bottom of the Application window.

Editing with Quick Fix Mode
453
Figure 1-13: Quick Fix mode enables you to view before-and-after previews of your image.
6. Use the Auto Red Eye fix to remove the red from your subjects’ eyes.
Automatically fix red-eye by clicking the Auto button under Red Eye Fix
in the General Fixes pane on the Edit tab in the Palette Bin on the right
side of the application window. If that doesn’t work, try the Red Eye
Removal tool in the new Touch Up pane at the bottom of the same 
Edit tab.
7. Apply any necessary auto fixes, such as Auto Smart Fix, Auto Levels,
Auto Contrast, and Auto Color Correction.
All these commands are under the Enhance menu or in the General
Fixes, Lighting, and Color panes on the Edit tab in the Palette Bin on the
right side of the application window.
Each of these fixes is described in the section “Applying One-Step Auto
Fixes,” earlier in this chapter. Remember that usually one of the fixes is
enough. Don’t stack them on top of each other. If one doesn’t work, click
the Reset button in the top-right of the image preview and try another. If
you’re not happy, go to Step 8. If you are happy, skip to Step 9.
8. If the auto fixes don’t quite cut it, gain more control by using the slid-
ers available for Smart Fix, Levels, Contrast, and Color, located in the
various panes on the Edit tab in the Palette Bin on the right of the
application window.

Here’s a brief description of each available adjustment:
• Lighten Shadows: When you drag the slider to the right, the darker
areas of your image lighten without adjusting the highlights.
• Darken Highlights: When you drag the slider to the right, the lighter
areas of your image darken without adjusting the shadows.
• Midtone Contrast: Adjusts the contrast of the middle (gray) values
and leaves the highlights and shadows as they are.
• Saturation: Adjusts the intensity of the colors.
• Hue: Changes all colors in an image. Make a selection first to change
the color of just one or more elements. Otherwise, use restraint with
this adjustment.
• Temperature: Adjusts the colors to make them warmer (red) or
cooler (blue). This adjustment can be used to correct skin tones or
to correct overly cool images (such as snowy winter photos) or
overly warm images (such as photos shot at sunset or sunrise).
• Tint: Adjusts the tint after you adjust temperature to make the color
more green or magenta.
If you still don’t get the results you need, move on to one of the more
manual adjustments that we describe in Book VIII, Chapter 2.
You can always apply fixes to just selected portions of your image.
Quick Fix mode offers the Quick Selection tool for your selection tasks.
For details on using this tool, see Book IV, Chapter 1.
9. Add final fixes by using the new Touch Up pane.
Here are the Touch Up pane options:
• Red Eye Removal Tool: If the Auto Red Eye Fix didn’t work, try using
this tool, described in the section “Auto Red Eye Fix,” earlier in this
chapter.
• Whiten Teeth: This new digital fix whitens teeth at a fraction of the
cost of the real analog procedure. Choose an appropriate brush size
from the Brushes drop-down panel before whitening (for more on
brush options, see Book V, Chapter 1). Using a brush diameter that’s
larger than the area of the teeth also whitens/brightens whatever
else it touches — lips, chin, and so on. Click the teeth. Note that this
tool makes a selection and whitens simultaneously. After your initial
click, your selection option converts from New Selection to Add to
Selection in the Options bar. If you pick up too much in your dental
selection, click the Subtract from Selection option and click the area

you want to eliminate. When you’re happy with the results of your
whitening session, choose Select➪Deselect or press Ctrl+D (Ô+D on
the Mac).
• Make Dull Skies Blue: Click or drag over areas of your sky that need
brightening. Choosing a brush size and selection option is similar to
using the Whiten Teeth fix, described in the preceding bullet. When
you click your sky, it is selected and brightened at the same time.
When you’re done, choose Select➪Deselect or press Ctrl+D (Ô+D on
the Mac).
• High Contrast Black and White Image: This tool converts your image
into a high-contrast grayscale image. The method and options are
similar to those for the Whiten Teeth and Make Dull Skies Blue
options, described in the preceding bullets. 
You can find these same fixes (and many more) in Full Edit mode, under
the new Smart Brush and Detailed Smart Brush tools. Check out Book
VIII, Chapter 2 for the lowdown on these tools.
10. Finally, sharpen your image either automatically (by clicking the Auto
button) or manually (by dragging the slider on the Sharpen panel).
This fix should always be the last adjustment you make on your image.
Sharpening increases contrast, so you want to fix the flaws first so you
don’t exacerbate them by making them more noticeable.
Cloning with the Clone Stamp Tool
Say that you want to duplicate an element in your image. That’s easy
enough, right? Make a selection and copy and paste it into the new location.
That works fine most of the time. But what if the element has a shadow
behind it, next to it, above it, or below it? You face the dilemma of having a
hard edge on the copied element because the shadow (called a cast shadow)
is cut off by the selection outline. You could feather the selection, but then
you have to make sure that the copied element blends realistically with the
background. What a pain. The better method is to clone the element by
using the Clone Stamp tool. It’s quick, easy, and no one will know that only
one element was there originally.
Believe it or not, you can also reach for this tool when retouching imperfec-
tions such as scratches, scars, bruises, and other minor flaws. In fact, that
used to be one of its major functions. In some retouching instances, it does
a decent job, although the arrival of the Healing Brush and Spot Healing
tools has relegated the Clone Stamp tool more to the pure cloning functions
and less to the hard-core retouching jobs.

Cloning with the Clone Stamp Tool
456
The Clone Stamp tool works by taking sampled pixels from one area and
cloning (or copying) them onto another area. Follow these steps to clone an
element without any genetic engineering:
1. Open an image and choose the Clone Stamp tool from the Tools panel
in Full Edit mode.
2. On the Options bar, choose a brush from the Brush Preset drop-down
list, and then use the brush as is or adjust its size with the Size slider.
3. Select the blend mode of your choice in the Options bar.
Selecting a mode such as Difference, Multiply, or Color can produce
some interesting special effects. For info on blend modes, see Book VI,
Chapter 3.
4. To make the clone more or less opaque, use the Opacity slider or text
box on the Options bar.
To make your cloned image appear ghosted, use an opacity percentage
of less than 100 percent.
5. Specify how fast the Clone Stamp tool applies the clone by adjusting
the Flow Rate percentage.
Again, we left our option at 100%.
6. Select or deselect the Aligned option, depending on your preference.
With Aligned selected, the clone source moves when you move your
cursor to a different location. If you want to clone multiple times from
the same location, deselect the Aligned option. 
7. Select or deselect the All Layers option.
This option enables you to sample pixels from all visible layers for the
clone. If this option is deselected, the Clone Stamp tool clones from
only the active layer. Check out Book VI for details about working with
layers.
8. Alt-click (Option-click) the area of your image that you want to clone
to define the source of the clone.
9. Click or drag along the area where you want the clone to appear, as
shown in Figure 1-14.
While you drag, Elements displays a crosshair icon along with your
Clone Stamp cursor. The crosshair represents the source you’re cloning
from, and the Clone Stamp cursor shows where the clone is being
applied. While you move the mouse, the crosshair moves as well. This
provides a continuous reference to the area of your image that you’re
cloning. Keep an eye on the crosshair, or you may clone something you
don’t want. 

Cloning with the Clone Stamp Tool
457
When you successfully complete the cloning process, you have two
identical objects. Figure 1-15 shows our identical apples.
Figure 1-14: When using the Clone Stamp tool, drag along the area 
where you want your clone to appear.
If you’re cloning an element, try to clone it without lifting your mouse.
Also, when you’re retouching a flaw, try not to overdo it. Clicking once
or twice on each flaw is usually plenty. If you’re heavy-handed with the
Clone Stamp, you get a blotchy effect that’s a telltale sign something has
been retouched.

Cosmetic Surgery with the Healing Brush Tool
458
Here are a few additional tidbits regarding the Clone Stamp tool:
 Use the Clone Stamp tool to fix simple flaws. To clean up a flaw that’s
pretty straight, such as a stray hair or scratch, Alt-click (Option-click on
the Mac) with the tool to define the source. Then, click at one end of
the straight flaw and Shift-click at the other end. The cloned source
pixels then cover up the flaw.
 Pay attention to the origin point for sampling. Depending on what
you’re cloning (for example, when covering up a flaw), if you keep sam-
pling from the same point without ever varying it, the area you’re
cloning starts to look like ugly shag carpeting. Or, at best, it starts to
appear blotchy and over-retouched.
 Zoom out once in a while to check how your image looks overall.
Doing so helps you avoid those funky telltale clone-stamp repetitive
patterns and blotches.
Cosmetic Surgery with the Healing Brush Tool
The Healing Brush tool is similar to the Clone Stamp tool. Both tools let you
clone pixels from one area and apply them to another area. But that’s where
the similarities end, and the Healing Brush leaves the Clone Stamp tool in
the dust.
The problem with the Clone Stamp tool is that it doesn’t take the tonality of
the flawed area — the shadows, midtones, and highlights — into considera-
tion. So, if the pixels you’re sampling from aren’t shaded and lit exactly like
the ones you’re covering, you have a mismatch in color, which makes seam-
less and indecipherable repairs hard to achieve.
That’s where the Healing Brush tool comes in. This very intelligent tool
clones by using the texture from the sampled area (the source) and then
using the colors around the brush stroke when you paint over the flawed
area (the destination). The highlights, midtones, and shadows remain
intact, and the result of the repair is more realistic and natural — not
blotchy, miscolored, and screaming of “retouched.” Follow these steps to
heal your favorite, but imperfect, photo:
1. Open an image in need of a makeover and select the Healing Brush
tool from the Tools panel in the Editor in Full Edit mode.

Cosmetic Surgery with the Healing Brush Tool
459
Our guy, shown in Figure 1-16,
looks like he could stand to get
some “work done,” as they say in
Hollywood. Note that you can also
heal between two images. Just
make sure that they have the same
color mode; for example, both
RGB (red, green, blue).
2. On the Options bar, click the
Brush Preset Picker.
In the drop-down panel, select
your desired diameter and hard-
ness, as well as spacing, angle, and
roundness if you want, for your
brush tip. You will most likely
specify your brush settings several
times while retouching your
image. Using the appropriate
brush size for the flaw you’re
repairing is important.
3. Specify a diameter and hardness
for your brush tip from the
Brush Picker drop-down panel on the Options bar.
You can also adjust the spacing, angle, and roundness. For details on
these options, see Book V, Chapter 1. Be sure to adjust the size of your
brush, as needed. Using the appropriate brush size for the flaw you’re
retouching is crucial for creating realism.
4. Choose your desired blend mode.
You can change your blend mode, if necessary. The Replace mode pre-
serves textures, such as noise or film grain, around the edges of your
strokes when you are using a soft brush. For most simple retouching
jobs, such as this one, you can leave it at Normal.
5. Choose one of these Source options:
You have a choice between Sampled and Pattern:
• Sampled: Uses the pixels from the image. You’ll probably use this
option 99.9 percent of the time.
• Pattern: Uses pixels from a pattern you select from the Pattern Picker
drop-down panel.
For our example, we’re sticking with Sampled because we don’t think
our guy would look that good with a Tie-Dye pattern across his face.

6. Select or deselect the Aligned option on the Options bar.
For most retouching tasks, you probably should leave Aligned selected.
Here are the details on each option:
• With Aligned selected: When you click or drag with the Healing
Brush, Elements displays a crosshair along with the Healing Brush
cursor. The crosshair represents the sampling point, also known as
the source. When you move the Healing Brush tool, the crosshair
also moves, providing a constant reference to the area you’re sam-
pling. We left the Aligned option selected in our example.
• With Aligned deselected: Elements applies the source pixels from
your initial sampling point, no matter how many times you stop and
start dragging.
7. Select the All Layers option to heal an image by using all visible
layers.
If this option is deselected, you heal from only the active layer.
To ensure maximum editing flexibility later, select the All Layers option
and add a new, blank layer above the image you want to heal. When you
heal the image, the pixels appear on the new layer and not on the image
itself. You can then adjust opacity, blend modes, and make other tweaks
to the “healed” pixels.
8. Establish the sampling point by
Alt-clicking (Option-clicking on 
the Mac).
Make sure to click the area of your
image you want to clone from.
In our example, we clicked the
smooth area on the chin and por-
tions of the forehead.
9. Release the Alt (Option on the
Mac) key and click or drag over a
flawed area of your image.
Pay attention to where the
crosshair is located because that’s
the area you’re healing from. We
brushed over the wrinkles under
and around the eyes and on the
forehead. This guy never looked
so good, as shown in Figure 1-17,
and he experienced absolutely no
recovery time.

Zeroing In with the Spot Healing Brush
461
Zeroing In with the Spot Healing Brush
Whereas the Healing Brush is designed to fix larger flawed areas, the Spot
Healing Brush is designed for smaller blemishes and little imperfections.
The biggest difference between the Healing Brush and the Spot Healing
Brush is that the Spot Healing Brush doesn’t require you to specify a sam-
pling source. It automatically takes a sample from around the area to be
retouched. The good news is it’s quick and easy. The downside is that it
doesn’t give you as much control over the sampling source. Consequently,
reserve this tool for small and simple flaws.
Follow these steps to quickly fix little, nitpicky imperfections with the Spot
Healing Brush tool:
1. In the Editor, in Full Edit mode, open your image and grab the Spot
Healing Brush tool from the Tools panel.
The moles on this guy’s face, as shown in Figure 1-18 on the left, are no
match for the power of the Spot Healing Brush.
PhotoSpin

2. On the Options bar, click the Brush Preset Picker and select your
desired diameter, hardness, and other options for your brush tip
from the drop-down panel.
Try to select a brush that’s a little larger than the flawed area you want
to fix.
3. Select a blend mode from the Options bar.
Just as with the Healing Brush, you can select the Replace mode. Most
likely, the Normal mode works the best.

4. Select a type from the Options bar:
• Proximity Match: Samples the pixels around the edge of the selection
to use to fix the flawed area
• Create Texture: Uses all the pixels in the selection to create a texture
to fix the flaw
Try Proximity Match first and, if it doesn’t work, undo and try Create
Texture.
5. Choose All Layers to heal an image by using all visible layers.
If you leave this option unselected, you heal from only the active layer.
6. Click, or click and drag, the area you want to fix.
In Figure 1-18, we used the Spot Healing Brush for the moles and spots
on the face.
Colorizing with the Color Replacement Tool
The Color Replacement tool allows you to replace the original color of an
image with the foreground color. You can use this tool in a variety of ways.
Create the look of a hand-painted photo by colorizing a grayscale image. Or
maybe you just want to change the color of an object or two, such as a
couple of flowers in a bouquet. And even though Elements has a bona fide
Red Eye tool, you can also use the Color Replacement tool to eliminate red
(or yellow or green) eye in people and animals.
The great thing about the Color Replacement tool is that, like the other heal-
ing tools, it completely preserves the tonality of the image. The color that
you apply doesn’t obliterate the midtones, shadows, and highlights as it
would if you were applying color with the regular Brush tool. The Color
Replacement tool works by first sampling the original colors in the image
and then replacing those colors with the foreground color. By specifying dif-
ferent sampling methods, limits, and tolerance settings, you can control the
range of colors that Elements replaces.
Follow these steps to replace existing color with your foreground color:
1. In the Editor, in Full Edit mode, open your image and select the Color
Replacement tool from the Tools panel.
This tool shares a flyout menu with the Brush and Pencil tools.
You can press B to select it (or Shift+B to cycle through the tools).
2. On the Options bar, specify your desired brush tip diameter and
hardness from the Brush Preset Picker drop-down panel.

Colorizing with the Color Replacement Tool
463
3. In the Options bar, select your desired blend mode:
• Color: This default mode works well for most colorizing jobs. Use
this mode if you’re trying to get rid of red eye.
• Hue: This mode is similar to color, but less intense, providing a sub-
tler effect.
• Saturation: This mode is the one to use to convert the color in your
image to grayscale. Set your foreground color to Black on the Tools
panel.
• Luminosity: This mode is the opposite of the Color mode. Although
this blend mode can create a beautiful effect between two image
layers, it doesn’t tend to provide that great an effect in other 
circumstances.
4. Select your sampling method (represented by the icons) from the
icons in the Options bar:
• Continuous: Samples and replaces color continuously while you drag
your mouse.
• Once: Replaces colors in only the areas that contain the color you
first sampled when you initially clicked.
• Background Swatch: Replaces colors in only the areas containing
your current background color.
5. Select your sampling limits mode.
• Contiguous: The default setting replaces the color of pixels contain-
ing the sampled color that are adjacent to each other directly under
the brush.
• Discontiguous: Replaces the color of the pixels containing the sam-
pled color wherever it occurs under your brush.
6. Specify your tolerance percentage.
Tolerance refers to a range of color. A high tolerance lets you replace a
broad range of color. A low tolerance limits the replacement of color to
only the areas that are very similar to the sampled color.
7. Choose whether you want anti-aliasing.
Remember, anti-aliasing slightly softens and smoothes the edge of the
sampled areas.
8. After you establish your settings, click or drag in your image.
Notice how the foreground color, which in our example is pink (who
doesn’t yearn for pink cowboy boots?), replaces the original colors of
the sampled areas (see Figure 1-19). Of course, the exact effect you get
depends on your settings.

Lightening and Darkening with Dodge and Burn Tools
464
If you want to be more accurate, make a selection before you replace your
color so you can avoid coloring elements you don’t want to color.
PhotoDisc
Figure 1-19: Use the Color Replacement tool to replace the original color 
in your image with your current foreground color.
Lightening and Darkening with Dodge and Burn Tools
Dodging and burning originated in the darkroom, where photographers
would salvage negatives containing areas that were too dark or too light by
adding or subtracting exposure as an enlarger made the prints.
An enlarger makes a print by projecting an image of a negative onto a piece
of photosensitive paper. During the exposure, the darkroom technician can
reduce the amount of light falling onto the paper by placing some object
(often a disk shape of cardboard or metal impaled on a piece of wire) in the
light path to dodge part of the image. The worker can burn other parts of an
image by exposing only a small portion through an opening, such as the fin-
gers in a cupped pair of hands or a piece of cardboard with a hole. The
Dodge and Burn tools in Elements adopt their icons from those analog tools
used in the darkroom.

Lightening and Darkening with Dodge and Burn Tools
465
However, the digital counterparts are a great deal more flexible and precise.
For example, the worker in a darkroom varies the size of the dodging or
burning tool by moving it up or down in the light path. Unfortunately, the
closer the real-world tool gets to the paper, the sharper it appears, forcing
the darkroom worker to move the tool more rapidly and frequently to blur
the edges of the effects. With Elements’ Dodge and Burn tools, you can spec-
ify the size of the tool and its softness by selecting one of the many brush
tips available.
You can also limit the correction to a specific tonal range in your image —
shadows, midtones, or highlights. You can adjust the degree of lightening
and darkening applied by specifying an exposure percentage, too.
The Dodge (used to lighten) and Burn (used to darken) tools can be very
effective, but you can’t add detail that isn’t there. Keep the following in
mind:
 When you lighten very dark shadows that contain little detail, you end
up with grayish shadows.
 Darkening very light areas that are completely washed out doesn’t make
your image look very good, either. You’ll end up with white patches.
In either case, you want to use the Dodge and Burn tools in moderation and
work only with small areas. To dodge or burn a portion of an image, just
follow these steps:
1. In the Editor, in Full Edit mode, open an image with under- or overex-
posed areas and select the Dodge or Burn tool from the Tools panel.
Press the O key to choose the tool or press Shift+O to cycle through the
available tools until the one you want is active.
2. In the Options bar, select a brush from the Brush Preset Picker drop-
down panel and also adjust the brush size, if necessary.
Larger, softer brushes spread the dodging-and-burning effect over a
larger area, making blending with the surrounding area easier, creating a
more realistic, un-retouched appearance.
3. In the Options bar, under the Range drop-down list, select Shadows,
Midtones, or Highlights.
Select Shadows to lighten or darken detail in the darker areas of your
image. Choose Midtones to adjust the tones of average darkness. And
select Highlights to make the brightest areas even lighter or darker.
In Figure 1-20, the original image had mostly dark areas, so we dodged
the shadows. Note the increased detail in the eyes, teeth, and hair. We
also gave a couple swipes to the highlight areas with the Burn tool.

4. In the Options bar, select the amount of correction you want to apply
with each stroke by using the Exposure slider or text box.
Exposure is similar to the Opacity setting that you use with the regular
Brush tool. Start with a lower percentage to better control the amount
of darkening or lightening. High exposure values can overcorrect and
produce unnatural-looking, obviously dodged or burned areas in your
images. We used a setting of 10 percent.
5. Drag or “paint” over the areas you want to lighten or darken, gradu-

6. If you go too far, press Ctrl+Z (Ô+Z on the Mac) to reverse your most
recent stroke.
7. When you finish, choose File➪Save to store the image.
Turning Color Up or Down with the Sponge Tool
The Sponge tool soaks up or squeezes up color. It can reduce the richness
or intensity (or saturation) of a color in applied areas. It can also perform
the reverse, giving a specific area richer, more vibrant colors.
Surprisingly, the Sponge tool also works in grayscale mode by darkening or
lightening the pixels. Unlike the Hue/Saturation command (under
Enhance➪Adjust Color), which works only on layers or selections, you can
use the Sponge tool on any area that you can paint with a brush.
You can use the Sponge tool on an image in subtle ways to reduce the satu-
ration in selected areas for an interesting effect. For example, you may have
an object that’s the center of attention in your picture simply because the
colors are very bright. The Sponge tool lets you reduce the color saturation
of that area (and only that area) to allow the other sections of your image to
become the focal point. You can also use the Sponge tool to make an artistic

statement: You could reduce or increase the saturation of a single person in
a group shot to give that person more attention (perhaps as being more col-
orful than the rest).
To use the Sponge tool, just follow these steps:
1. In the Editor, in Full Edit mode, open an image and select the Sponge
tool from the Tools panel.
Press the O key to choose the Sponge if it’s active, or press Shift+O to
cycle through the tools until the Sponge tool is active.
2. In the Options bar, select a brush from the Brushes presets drop-
down panel.
Use large, soft brushes to saturate/desaturate a larger area.
Smaller brushes are useful mostly to change the saturation of a specific
small object in an image.
3. In the Options bar, select either Desaturate (reduce saturation) or
Saturate (increase saturation) from the Mode drop-down list.
4. In the Options bar, select a flow rate (the speed with which the 
saturation/desaturation effect builds while you brush) with the Flow
slider or text box.
5. Paint carefully over the areas you want to saturate or desaturate with
color.
In Figure 1-21, we saturated the shower cap lady to make her more of a
focal point and desaturated the other performers and the background.

Smoothing with the Smudge Tool
468
Smoothing with the Smudge Tool
The Smudge tool performs a kind of warping effect by pushing your pixels
around as if they consisted of wet paint, using the color that’s under the
cursor when you start to stroke. However, don’t view the Smudge tool as a
simple distortion tool that produces only comical effects. We use it on tiny
areas of an image to soften the edges of objects in a way that often looks
more natural than when we use the Blur tool. The Smudge tool can also be
used to create a soft, almost-painted look, as shown in Figure 1-22. Just
don’t get too carried away, or you may obliterate detail that you want to
preserve.
Figure 1-22: The Smudge tool can give your objects a soft, painted look.
Smudged areas may be obvious because of their smooth appearance.
Adding a little texture by using the Noise filter after you smudge is often a
good idea if you want to blend a smudged section in with its surroundings.
You can find tips on applying the Noise filter in Book VII, Chapter 1.
To apply the Smudge tool, just follow these steps:
1. In the Editor, in Full Edit mode, open the image and select the
Smudge tool from the Tools panel.
2. In the Options bar, select a brush from the Brushes Presets drop-
down panel.
Use a small brush for smudging tiny areas, such as edges. Larger
brushes produce drastic effects, so use them with care.

469
3. In the Options bar, select a blending mode from the Mode pop-up
menu.
4. In the Options bar, select the strength of the smudging effect with the
Strength slider or text box.
Low values produce a lighter effect; high values really push your pixels
around.
5. If your image has multiple layers, select the All Layers option to make
Elements use pixels from all visible layers when it produces the
effect.
The smudge still appears only on the active layer, but the look is a bit
different depending on the contents of the underlying layers.
6. Use the Finger Painting option to begin the smudge by using the fore-
ground color.
You can get some interesting effects with this option. Rather than use
the color under your cursor, this option smears your foreground color
at the start of each stroke. 
You can switch the Smudge tool into Finger Painting mode temporarily
by holding down the Alt key (the Option key on the Mac) while you
drag. Release Alt/Option to go back to Normal mode.
7. Paint over the areas you want to smudge.
Pay attention to your strokes because this tool can radically change
your image. If you don’t like the results, press Ctrl+Z (Ô+Z on the Mac)
to undo the changes and then lower the Strength percentage (discussed
in Step 4) even more.
This tool can be a little on the destructive side. If you’re looking to pre-
serve reality, use it with restraint. If you want to get wild, go crazy.
8. When you finish, choose File➪Save to store your image.
Softening with the Blur Tool
The Blur tool can be used for both repair and more creative tasks. Adding a
little blur here and there can save an image with a few defects. Blurring can
also be used for artistic effect — say, to add a little motion to a soccer ball
frozen in time by a too-fast shutter speed. You can also blur portions of 
your image to emphasize and focus on a particular element, as shown in
Figure 1-23, where we blurred the water and the girl’s body a bit to draw
attention to her face. The Blur tool makes it easy to paint your blur effects
exactly where you want them. This tool works by decreasing the contrast
among adjacent pixels in the area painted.

The mechanics of using the Blur tool and several of its options are similar to
those of the Smudge tool. Just follow these steps:
1. In the Editor, in Full Edit mode, open an image and select the Blur
tool from the Tools panel.
2. In the Options bar, select a brush from the Brushes Presets drop-
down panel.
Use a small brush for applying small areas of blur.
Use larger brushes with caution. For example, if your goal is to blur the
entire background to make a foreground object appear sharper in com-
parison, it is better to make a selection and apply the Blur filter, as
described in Book VII, Chapter 1.
3. In the Options bar, select a blending mode from the Mode pop-up
menu.
4. In the Options bar, select the strength of the blurring effect with the
Strength slider or text box.
5. If your image has multiple layers, select the All Layers option to make
Elements use pixels from all visible layers when it produces the
effect.
Selecting this option can produce a smoother blur when you merge the
layers later. See Book VI for more info on layers.
6. Paint over the areas you want to blur.
7. When you finish, choose File➪Save to store your image.

Focusing with the Sharpen Tool
471
Focusing with the Sharpen Tool
In theory, the Sharpen tool is nothing
more than the Blur tool in reverse —
instead of decreasing contrast among
pixels, the Sharpen tool increases the
contrast. In practice, however, use this
tool with a bit more care than the Blur
tool. Where blurred areas tend to fade
from a viewer’s notice (at least, in
terms of how his or her eyes perceive
them), sharpened areas of an image
jump out at people. Even a small area
that has been over-sharpened can
quickly lead to overly grainy and 
noisy images.
You can often successfully sharpen
small areas with the Sharpen tool.
Sometimes, the eyes in a portrait can
benefit from a little sharpening, as
shown in Figure 1-24. Or you might
want to sharpen an area to make it
stand out more distinctly against a
slightly blurred background.
Follow these simple steps to use the Sharpen tool:
1. In the Editor, in Full Edit mode, open an image and select the Sharpen
tool from the Tools panel.
2. In the Options bar, select a brush from the Brushes Presets drop-
down panel.
Use a small brush for applying small areas of sharpening.
3. In the Options bar, select a blending mode from the Mode pop-up
menu.
4. In the Options bar, select the strength of the sharpening effect with
the Strength slider or text box.
Using a fairly low value (say, 25 percent or less) is a good idea because
you can build up sharpness slowly, being careful not to overdo it.
You know you’ve gone too far with the sharpness when the pixels start
to look noisy and grainy.

6. Paint over the areas you want to sharpen.
7. When you finish, choose File➪Save to store your image.
Sharpening increases contrast, so be careful when using the Sharpen tool if
you plan to also adjust the Levels or Curves controls. Any change that
increases contrast in the whole image also boosts the contrast of an area
you’ve sharpened.
The Unsharp Mask and Smart Sharpen filters offer more options and better
overall control, so unless you really need to use the sharpening effect,
you’re usually better off using a filter. (Book VII, Chapter 1, has more on fil-
ters in general.)
Fixing a Photo
Unless you’re a highly skilled photographer, you probably have a few photos that require
a number of digital fixes. Certainly, we both do. Although it may seem like fixing them is
too much trouble or will take too long, you’ll find how easy it is after you practice the
techniques a few times. After awhile, you may even get into the habit of running through
your personal quick-fixing workflow before you organize and archive your images in the
Organizer (or Adobe Bridge on the Mac). If you have more time to burn, you can also add
a few artistic touches to further enhance those shots. That way when you get the urge to
share those photos, they are just an e-mail or print away.
Note that most of the details for executing these steps are described in this chapter.
When they aren’t, we give you the book and chapter where you can find further explana-
tions. If these steps are too tedious for you, you can always follow the Quick Fix mode
route we described earlier in the section, “Editing with Quick Fix mode.”

rotation amount.
4. To allow for maximum flexibility in editing, convert your background to a layer 
by double-clicking Background in the Layers panel. Click OK in the New Layer
dialog box.
For details on working with layers, see Book VI.
5. Adjust the contrast of your image, if needed. Try Enhance➪Auto Contrast. If that
doesn’t work well, undo it (Ctrl+Z or Cmd+Z on the Mac) and try Enhance➪Adjust
Lighting➪Shadows and Highlights or Levels.
Make sure you have good tones in the shadows (dark areas), midtones (middle
toned areas), and highlights (light areas). Also ensure that you can see details in 
all of the tonal ranges. For details on using the Shadows and Highlight and Levels
commands, see Book VIII, Chapter 2. For our woman, we broke out the big guns —
Levels.

6. Adjust the color of your image, if needed. If you didn’t use an auto fix in Step 6, you
could try the Auto Color command under the Enhance submenu. Or choose
Enhance➪Adjust Color and select one of the color-adjustment commands
described in Book VIII, Chapter 2.
If you need to adjust the skin tones of your people, you can try the Adjust Skin Tones
command. We recommend using the Color Curves commands for overall color
adjustment, as we did for our woman. Usually working with this curve will do the
trick, no matter what your color issues are.
Note that you can fix just selected portions of your image. Make a selection first and
then apply the adjustment. For details on making selections, see Book IV, Chapter 1.

This fix should always be the last adjustment you make on your image. You want to
make sure that all your contrast, color, and flaws are fixed before sharpening. The
reason is that the sharpening process increases contrast, so you don’t want to
exacerbate any problems that may exist.

f you’ve tried the quick automatic fixes on your photos but they didn’t
correct them to your satisfaction, then this chapter should be of some
help. Fortunately, Elements offers multiple ways and multiple levels of cor-
recting and enhancing your images. If an auto fix doesn’t work, elevate to a
manual fix. Chances are that if you can’t find the tools to correct and repair
your images in Elements, those images are probably beyond salvaging.
Using this chapter and the information provided in Chapter 1 of this Book as
your jumping-off points, try to employ some kind of logical workflow
when you tackle the correction and repair of your images.
Personally, we’re partial to the following series of steps:
1. Crop, straighten, and resize your images, if 
necessary.
2. After you have the images in their proper
physical state, correct the lighting and estab-
lish good tonal range for your shadows, high-
lights, and midtones in order to display the
greatest detail possible.
Often, just correcting the lighting solves minor
color problems. If not, move on to adjusting the
color balance.
3. Eliminate any colorcasts and adjust the saturation, if
necessary.
4. Grab the retouching tools, such as the healing tools and filters, to
retouch any flaws.

Understanding the Histogram Panel
478
5. Sharpen your image if you feel that it could use a boost in clarity and
sharpness.
6. Apply any enhancements or special effects, if desired.
By following these steps, in this order, you should be able to get all your
images in shape to print, post, and share with family and friends.
Understanding the Histogram Panel
One of the first things you want to do before you make any color or tonal
adjustments to your image is to take a good look at the quality and distribu-
tion of the tones throughout your image. We don’t mean just eyeballing the
composite image on your screen. We’re talking about getting inside your
image and looking at its guts with the Histogram panel — and keeping it
onscreen so you can see its constant feedback on your image adjustments.
A histogram displays the tonal range
of an image, as shown in Figure 2-1. It
shows how the pixels are distributed
by graphing the number of pixels at
each of the 256 brightness levels in an
image. On this graph, pixels with the
same brightness level are stacked in
bars along a vertical axis. The higher
the line from this axis, the greater the
number of pixels at that brightness
level. You can view the distribution for
the entire image, a selected layer, or
an adjustment composite (described
in the following section).
From this graph, you can determine
whether the image contains enough
detail in the shadow, midtone, and
highlight areas. This information helps you determine what image adjust-
ments you may need to make. The following steps walk you through the
basics of using the panel and understanding the information you find 
there:
1. Choose Window➪Histogram to bring up the panel.
2. Choose your desired source of the histogram’s display from the
Source drop-down list:
• Entire image: Displays a histogram of the entire image.
• Selected layer: Displays a histogram of just the selected layers in the
Layers panel.
Figure 2-1: The Histogram panel displays
how pixels are distributed at each of the
256 brightness levels.

Understanding the Histogram Panel
479
• Adjustment Composite: Displays a histogram of a selected adjustment
layer and all the layers below it.
3. Choose to view isolated portions of your image by choosing an option
from the Channels drop-down list:
• RGB: Displays a composite image of all color channels — red, green,
and blue.
• Red, Green and Blue: Displays the histogram of each individual color
channel. For more on channels, see “Selecting a Color Mode” in 
Book III, Chapter 2.
• Luminosity: Displays the luminance, or intensity, of the RGB compos-
ite image.
• Colors: Displays the composite RGB histogram by color. Red, green,
and blue represent the pixels in each of those channels. Gray repre-
sents the area where all three channels overlap.
4. Examine the tonal range in the histogram.
An image with good tonal range displays pixels in all areas. An image
with poor tonal range has gaps in the histogram, as shown in Figure 2-2.
The rest of this chapter explains ways you can correct contrast and
color problems that you find.
5. If you’re into numbers, check the statistics to evaluate your image, as
well. Drag your cursor within the histogram to see the statistics about
a range of values. Or position the cursor within a specific area of the
histogram you’re interested in.
Some of these statistics, such as Standard Deviation, may be for those
who live in the mathematical land of Statistics. But you may be able to
get some useful information from the other statistics that can help you in
your image-adjusting tasks. Here’s a brief explanation of each statistic:
• Mean: Average intensity value
• Standard Deviation: How much the intensity values vary
• Median: Middle value of the intensity value range
• Pixels: Total number of pixels used to represent the histogram
• Level: Intensity level
• Count: The total number of pixels corresponding to that intensity level
• Percentile: The number of cumulative pixels (in percentages) at or
below that level, from 0% (left) to 100% (right)
• Cache Level: The current level of image cache used to calculate the
histogram. For more info on cache, see Book I, Chapter 4.

Adjusting Lighting
Elements has several simple, manual tools you can use to fix lighting if the
Auto tools (that we describe in Book VIII, Chapter 1) don’t cut the mustard.
The manual tools offer more control for adjusting overall contrast, as well
as bringing out details in shadow, midtones, and highlight areas of your
images. Note that all lighting adjustments can be found in both Full Edit and
Quick Fix modes.

Fixing lighting with Shadows/Highlights
The Shadows/Highlights command offers a quick-and-easy method of cor-
recting over- and underexposed areas. This feature works especially well
with images shot in bright, overhead light or in light coming from the back
(backlit). These images usually suffer from having the subject partially or
completely surrounded in shadows, such as the original image (left) in
Figure 2-3.
Figure 2-3: Correct the lighting in your images with the Shadows/Highlights
adjustment.
To use the Shadows/Highlights adjustment, follow these steps:
1. In Full Edit or Quick Fix mode, choose Enhance➪Adjust
Lighting➪Shadows/Highlights and make sure the Preview check box
is selected.
When the Shadows/Highlights dialog box appears, the default correc-
tion is automatically applied in your preview.
2. If the default adjustment doesn’t fix the problem, move the sliders (or
enter a value) to adjust the amount of correction for your shadows
(dark areas), highlights (light areas), and midtones (middle-toned
areas).

Try to reveal more detail in the dark and light areas of your image. If,
after you do so, your image still looks as if it needs more correction,
then add or delete contrast in your midtone areas.
3. Click OK to apply the adjustment and close the dialog box.
If you want to start over, press Alt (Option on the Mac) and click the
Reset button (previously the Cancel button).
Using Brightness/Contrast
Despite its very descriptive name, the Brightness/Contrast command 
doesn’t do a great job of either brightening (making an image darker or
lighter) nor adjusting contrast. Initially, users tend to be drawn to this com-
mand because of its logical name and ease of use. But, after users realize its
limitations, they move on to better tools with more controls, such as
Shadows/Highlights and Levels.
The problem with the Brightness/Contrast command is that it applies the
adjustment equally to all areas of the image. For example, you may have a
photo that has some highlights that need darkening, but all the midtones
and shadows are okay. The Brightness slider isn’t adept enough to recog-
nize that, so when you start to darken the highlights in your image, the mid-
tones and shadows also become darker. To compensate for the unwanted
darkening, you try to adjust the Contrast, which doesn’t fix the problem.
The moral is, if you want to use the Brightness/Contrast command, select
only the areas that need the correction, as shown in Figure 2-4. (For more
on selections, see Book IV, Chapters 1 and 2.) After you make your selection,
choose Enhance➪Adjust Lighting➪Brightness/Contrast.
You can also find the Brightness and Contrast command in Guided mode.
Figure 2-4: The Brightness/Contrast adjustment is best reserved for 
correcting selected areas (left) rather than the entire image (right).

Adjusting Lighting
483
Nailing proper contrast with Levels
If you want the real deal when it comes to correcting the brightness and
contrast (and even the color) in your image, look no further than the Levels
command. Granted, the dialog box is a tad more complex than those for the
other lighting and color-adjustment commands, but when you understand
how it works, the payoff is well worth it.
You can get a taste of what Levels can do by using Auto Levels, explained in
Book VIII, Chapter 1. However, the Levels command offers much more con-
trol. And, unlike the rudimentary Brightness/Contrast command, Levels
enables you to darken or lighten 256 different tones. Keep in mind that
Levels can be used on your entire image, a single layer, or a selected area.
You can also apply the Levels command by using an adjustment layer, a rec-
ommended method, as we describe in Book VI, Chapter 1.
If you’re serious about image editing, the Levels command is one tool you
want to master. Here’s how it works:
1. In Full Edit or Quick Fix mode, choose Enhance➪Adjust Lighting➪
Levels.
We recommend using Full Edit mode for this command because you
have access to the Info panel needed in Step 2.
The Levels dialog box appears, displaying its own histogram. This graph
displays how the pixels of the image are distributed at each of the 256
available brightness levels. Shadows are shown on the left side of the
histogram, midtones are in the middle, and highlights are on the right.
For details on histograms, see the first section of this chapter.
Although you generally make changes to the entire document by using
the RGB channel, you can apply changes to any one of an image’s com-
ponent color channels by selecting the specific channel in the Channel
pop-up menu. You can also make adjustments to just selected areas,
which can be helpful when one area of your image needs adjusting and
others don’t.
2. In Full Edit mode, choose Window➪Info to open the Info panel.
3. Set the black and white points manually by using the eyedroppers in
the dialog box; first select the White Eyedropper tool and then move
the cursor over the image.
4. Look at the Info panel, try to find the lightest white in the image, and
then select that point by clicking it.
The lightest white has the highest RGB values.
Book VIII
Chapter 2
Correcting Lighting,
Color, and Clarity

Adjusting Lighting
484
5. Repeat Steps 3 and 4, using the Black Eyedropper tool and trying to
find the darkest black in the image.
The darkest black has the lowest RGB values.
When you set the pure black and pure white points, the remaining
pixels are redistributed between those two points.
You can also reset the white and black points by moving the position of
the white and black triangles on the input sliders (just below the his-
togram). Or, you can enter values in the Input Levels boxes. The three
boxes represent the black, gray, and white triangles, respectively. Use
the numbers 0 to 255 in the white and black boxes.
6. Use the Gray Eyedropper tool to remove any colorcasts by selecting a
neutral gray portion of your image, one in which the Info panel
shows equal values of red, green, and blue.
Note that if your image is grayscale, you can’t use the Gray Eyedropper
tool.
If you’re not sure where there’s a neutral gray, you can also remove a
colorcast by choosing a color channel from the Channel pop-up menu
and doing one of the following:
• Choose the Red channel and drag the midtone slider to the right to
add cyan or to the left to add red.
• Choose the Green channel and drag the midtone slider to the right
to add magenta or to the left to add green.
• Choose the Blue channel and drag the midtone slider to the right to
add yellow or to the left to add blue.
7. If your image has too much contrast, adjust the output sliders at the
bottom of the Levels dialog box.
Moving the black triangle to the right reduces the contrast in the shad-
ows and lightens the image. Moving the white triangle to the left
reduces the contrast in the highlights and darkens the image.
8. Adjust the midtones (or gamma values) with the gray triangle input
slider.
The default value for gamma is 1.0. Drag the triangle to the left to
lighten midtones and drag to the right to darken them. You can also
enter a value.
9. Click OK to apply your settings and close the dialog box.
The contrast in your images should be improved, as shown in Figure 2-5.

Adjusting Color
485
Figure 2-5: Improve the contrast of an image with the Levels 
command.
When you click the Auto button, Elements applies the same adjustments as
the Auto Levels command, as we explain in Book VIII, Chapter 1. Note the
changes and subsequent pixel redistribution made to the histogram after
you click this button.
Adjusting Color
Getting the color you want sometimes seems about as attainable as finding a
pot of gold at the end of a rainbow. Sometimes, an unexpected colorcast (a shift
in color) can be avoided when photographing, for example, by using (or not
using, in some cases) a flash or lens filter. After the fact, you can usually do a
decent job of correcting the color with one of the many Elements adjustments.
Occasionally, you may want to change the color of your image to create a cer-
tain special effect. Conversely, you also may want to strip out most the color
from your image to create a vintage feel. Remember that all these color adjust-
ments can be applied to your entire image, a single layer, or just a selection.
Whatever your color needs, they’ll no doubt be met in Elements.
All color adjustments can be found in either Full Edit or Quick Fix mode
except for Defringe Layers, which is available only in Full Edit mode.
If you shoot your photos in the Camera Raw file format, you can open and
fix your files in the Camera Raw dialog box. Remember that Camera Raw
files haven’t been processed by your camera. You’re in total control of the
color and the exposure. For more on Camera Raw, see Book III, Chapter 3.
Removing color casts automatically
If you ever took a photo in an office or classroom and got a nasty green tint
in your image, it was most likely caused by the overhead fluorescent light-
ing. To eliminate this green tint, or color cast, you can apply the Remove
Color Cast command. This feature is designed to adjust the image’s overall
color and remove the cast.

Follow these short steps to correct your image:
1. Choose Enhance➪Adjust Color➪Remove Color Cast in either Full Edit
or Quick Fix mode.
The Remove Color Cast dialog box appears. Move the dialog box to
better view your image. Note that this command is also available in
Guided mode.
2. Click an area in your photo that should be white, black, or neutral
gray, as shown in Figure 2-6.
Corbis Digital Stock
Figure 2-6: Get rid of nasty color shifts with the Remove Color 
Cast command.
The colors in the image are adjusted according to the color you choose.
Which color should you choose? The answer depends on the subject
matter of your image. Feel free to experiment. Your adjustment is
merely a preview at this point and isn’t applied until you click OK. If you
goof up, click the Reset button, and your image reverts to its unad-
justed state.
3. If you’re satisfied with the adjustment, click OK to accept it and close
the dialog box.
If the Remove Color Cast command doesn’t fix the problem, try applying a
photo filter (as we describe in the section “Adjusting color temperature 
with photo filters,” later in this chapter). For example, if your photo has too
much green, try applying a magenta filter.
Adjusting with Hue/Saturation
The Hue/Saturation command enables you to adjust the colors in your
image based on their hue, saturation, and lightness. Hue is the color in your
image. Saturation is the intensity, or richness, of that color. And lightness
controls the brightness value.

Adjusting Color
487
Follow these steps to adjust color by using the Hue/Saturation command:
1. In either Full Edit or Quick Fix mode, choose Enhance➪Adjust
Color➪Adjust Hue/Saturation.
The Hue/Saturation dialog box appears. Be sure to select the Preview
check box so that you can view your adjustments. Note that this com-
mand is also available in Guided mode.
2. Select all the colors (Master) from the dialog box’s Edit drop-down list
or choose one color to adjust.
3. Drag the slider for one or more of the following attributes to adjust
the colors as described:
• Hue: Shifts all the colors clockwise (drag right) or counterclockwise
(drag left) around the color wheel.
• Saturation: Increases (drag right) or decreases (drag left) the rich-
ness of the colors. Note that dragging all the way to the left gives
you the appearance of a grayscale image.
• Lightness: Increases the brightness values by adding white (drag
right) or decreases the brightness values by adding black (drag left).
The top color ramp at the bottom of the dialog box represents the colors
in their order on the color wheel before you make any changes. The
lower color bar displays the colors after you make your adjustments.
When you select an individual color to adjust, sliders appear between
the color bars so that you can define the range of color to be adjusted.
You can select, add, or subtract colors from the range by choosing one
of the Eyedropper tools and clicking in the image.
The Hue/Saturation dialog box also lets you colorize images, a useful
option for creating sepia-colored images.
4. (Optional) Check the Colorize option to change the colors in your
image to a new, single color. Drag the Hue slider to change the color
to the desired hue.
The pure white and black pixels remain unchanged, and the intermedi-
ate gray pixels are colorized.
Use the Hue/Saturation command, with the Colorize option, to create tinted
photos, such as the one shown in Figure 2-7. You can also make selections in
a grayscale image and apply a different tint to each selection. This can be
especially fun with portraits. Tinted images can create a vintage or moody
feel and can greatly improve mediocre photos.

Eliminating color with Remove Color
Despite all the talk in this chapter about color, we realize that there may be
times when you don’t want any color. With the Remove Color command, you
can eliminate all the color from an image, layer, or selection. In Figure 2-8, we
selected the background and applied the Remove Color command. To use
this one-step command, simply choose Enhance➪Adjust Color➪
Remove Color.
Purestock

Adjusting Color
489
Sometimes, stripping away color with this command can leave your image
flat, or low in contrast. If this is the case, adjust the contrast by using one of
Elements’ many lighting fixes, such as Auto Levels, Auto Contrast, or Levels.
The Convert to Black and White command (under the Enhance menu)
enables you to convert a selection, a layer, or an entire image to grayscale.
But, rather than just arbitrarily strip color as the Remove Color command
does, the Convert to Black and White command enables you to select a con-
version method by first choosing an image style. To further refine the
results, you can add or subtract colors (Red, Green, or Blue) or contrast by
moving the Intensity sliders until your grayscale image looks the way you
want. Note that you aren’t really adding color; you’re simply altering the
amount of data in the color channels. 
Switching colors with Replace Color
The Replace Color command enables you to replace designated colors in an
image with other colors. You first select the colors you want to replace by
creating a mask, which is a selection made by designating white (selected),
black (unselected), and gray (partially selected) areas. See Book VI, Chapter
4 for more details on working with masks. You can then adjust the hue
and/or saturation of those selected colors.
Follow these steps to replace colors with others:
1. In Quick Fix or Full Edit mode, choose Enhance➪Adjust
Color➪Replace Color.
The Replace Color dialog box appears. Make sure to select the Preview
check box.
2. Choose either Selection or Image:
• Selection: Shows the mask in the Preview area. The deselected areas
are black, partially selected areas are gray, and selected areas are
white.
• Image: Shows the actual image in the Preview area.
3. Click the colors you want to select in either the image or the Preview
area.
4. Shift-click or use the plus sign (+) Eyedropper tool to add more colors.
5. Press the Alt (Option on the Mac) key or use the minus sign (–)
Eyedropper tool to delete colors.
6. To add colors similar to the ones you select, use the Fuzziness slider
to fine-tune your selection, adding or deleting from the selection
based on the Fuzziness value.

Correcting with Color Curves
The most sophisticated of the color correctors is the Color Curves com-
mand. This adjustment attempts to improve the tonal range in color images
by making adjustments to highlights, shadows, and midtones in each color
channel. Try using this command on images in which the foreground ele-
ments appear overly dark due to backlighting. Conversely, the adjustment is
also designed to correct images that appear overexposed and washed out.

one color with another.
Here’s how to use this adjustment on a selection, a layer, or an entire image:

Adjusting skin tones
Sometimes, the family and friends in your photos appear nauseated (green),
sunburned (red), frigid (blue), or have taken on some other non-flesh
-colored tone. To fix that problem, Elements provides a command that’s
designed to adjust the overall color in the image and get skin tones back to
more natural and attractive shades.
Here’s how to fix those skin tones:
1. Open your image in Quick Fix or Full Edit mode, select the Preview
check box, and do one or both of the following:
• Select the layer that needs to be adjusted. If you don’t have any layers,
your entire image is adjusted.
• Select the desired areas of skin that need to be adjusted. Only the
selected areas are adjusted. This is recommended if you’re satisfied
with the color of your other elements and just want to fix the skin
tones. For more on selection techniques, see Book IV, Chapter 1.
2. Choose Enhance➪Adjust Color➪Adjust Color for Skin Tone.
The Adjust Color for Skin Tone dialog box appears. This command can
also be found in Guided mode.
3. In the Image window, click the portion of skin that needs to be 
corrected.
The command adjusts the color of the skin tone, as well as the color in the
overall image, layer, or selection, depending on what you selected in Step 1.
4. If you’re unhappy with the results, click another area or adjust the
Skin and Ambient Light sliders:
• Tan: Adds or removes the amount of brown in the skin.
• Blush: Adds or removes the amount of red in the skin.

Defringing layers
A surefire sign of a sloppily composited image is a selection with a fringe.
Don’t get us wrong, if the fringe is the kind that is hanging off of your 
’70s-era buckskin leather jacket, that’s fine. You just don’t want the fringe
that consists of those background pixels that surrounds the edges of your
selections, as shown in Figure 2-13. Sometimes, when you make a selection,
some of the background pixels are picked up in the process. These pixels
are referred to as a fringe or halo. Luckily, the Defringe command replaces
the color of the fringe pixels with the colors of neighboring pixels that don’t
contain the background color. In our example, we plucked the globe out of a
white background and placed it on a black background. Some of the back-
ground pixels were included in our selection and appear as white fringe.
When we apply the Defringe command, those white fringe pixels are
changed to colors of nearby pixels, as shown in Figure 2-13.

Although we give you several ways in this chapter to eliminate colorcasts in
an image, here’s one more. The Variations command has been around for
years and is largely unchanged. That’s probably because it’s one of those
rare features that’s easy to use, easy to understand, and is actually effective.
The command works by enabling you to make corrections by visually com-
paring thumbnails of color variations of your image. You might use this
command when you’re not quite sure what’s wrong with the color or what
kind of colorcast your image has.

Here’s how to use the Color Variations command:
1. Choose Enhance➪Adjust Color➪Color Variations in Quick Fix or Full
Edit mode.
The Color Variations dialog box appears, displaying a preview of your
original image (before) and the corrected image (after), as shown in
Figure 2-14.
Purestock
Figure 2-14: Color Variations enables you to color-correct your images 
by comparing thumbnails.
2. Select your desired tonal range or color richness (if you’re unsure
which range to select, start with the Midtones):
• Shadows, Midtones, Highlights: Adjusts the dark, middle, or light
areas in the image, respectively.
• Saturation: Adjusts the color intensity or richness, making colors
more intense (saturated) or less intense (desaturated). If your image
is faded from time, be sure to increase the saturation after you cor-
rect any colorcast issues.
Usually, just correcting the midtones is enough to improve your image’s
color. But if that doesn’t do the trick, try adjusting the shadows and
highlights as well.
3. Specify how much adjustment you want with the Adjust Color
Intensity slider.

Drag left to decrease the amount of adjustment and drag right to
increase the amount.
4. If you selected Midtones, Shadows, or Highlights in Step 2, adjust the
color by clicking the various Increase or Decrease Color buttons.
Click more than once if your initial application wasn’t sufficient to cor-
rect the problem.
Be sure to keep an eye on the After thumbnail, which reflects your cor-
rections while you make them.
5. Click the Darken or Lighten buttons to make the colors a little darker
or lighter, respectively.
6. If you selected Saturation in Step 2, click the Less Saturation or More
Saturation buttons.
7. If you make a mistake, click the Undo button.
The Color Variations dialog box supports multiple levels of undo. If you
totally mess things up, click the Reset Image button to start again. Keep
in mind that you can’t undo the Reset Image command after you click it.
Click Cancel to abandon ship.
8. To apply your color adjustments and close the dialog box, click OK.
Try using the Color Variations command to correct those old, faded, green-
tinted photos from back in the day. This feature enables you to easily cor-
rect the color and saturation of those memory-filled shots. Remember to
either decrease the offending color or add the color that’s the opposite of
the color cast in the image. If it’s too green, add magenta and vice versa. 
Adjusting color temperature with photo filters
Light has its own color temperature. A photo shot in a higher color temper-
ature of light makes an image blue. An image shot in a lower-color tempera-
ture makes a photo yellow. Photographers sometimes use colored glass
filters in front of their camera lenses to adjust the color temperature of the
light. They do this to either warm up or cool down photos, or to just add a
hint of color for subtle special effects. You can, however, mimic this effect in
Elements with the digital version of these filters.
To apply the Photo Filter adjustment, follow these steps:
1. In Full Edit mode, choose Filter➪Adjustments➪Photo Filter.
The Photo Filter dialog box appears.
Note that you can also apply the photo filter to an individual layer by
creating a photo-filter adjustment layer. For details on adjustment
layers, see Book VI, Chapter 1.

2. In the dialog box, select Filter to choose a preset filter from the drop-
down list, or select Color to select your own filter color from the
Color Picker.
Here’s a brief description of each of the preset filters:
• Warming Filter (85), (81), and (LBA): Adjust the white balance in an
image to make the colors warmer or more yellow. Filter (81) is like
(85) and (LBA), but it’s best used for minor adjustments. 
• Cooling Filter (80), (82), and (LBB): Also adjust the white balance
that’s shown, but instead of making the colors warmer, they make
the colors cooler or bluer. Filter (82) is like (80) and (LBB), but it’s
designed for slight adjustments.
• Red, Orange, Yellow, and so on: The various color filters adjust the
hue, or color, of a photo. Choose a color filter to try to eliminate a
colorcast or to apply a special effect.
3. Adjust the Density option to specify the amount of color applied to
your image.
4. Check Preserve Luminosity to prevent the photo filter from darken-
ing your image.
5. Click OK to apply your filter and close the dialog box.
Figure 2-15 shows the image before and after the application of a photo
filter.

Mapping your colors
Elements provides some commands referred to as color mappers, which
change the colors in your image by mapping them to other values. The color
mappers are found in the Filter➪Adjustments submenu. Figure 2-16 shows
results of using these commands, which are also briefly described in the fol-
lowing sections.

to other values.
Equalize
This mapper first locates the lightest and darkest pixels in the image and
assigns them values of white and black. It then redistributes all the remain-
ing pixels among the grayscale values. The exact effect depends on your
individual image.
Gradient Map
This command maps the tonal range of an image to the colors of your
chosen gradient. For example, colors (such as orange, green, and purple)
are mapped to the shadows, highlight, and midtone areas.
Invert
This command reverses all the colors in your image, creating a kind of nega-
tive. Black reverses to white, and colors convert to their complementary
hues (blue goes to yellow, red goes to cyan, and so on).

Threshold
Threshold makes your image black and white, with all pixels that are
brighter than a value you specify represented as white, and all pixels that
are darker than that value as black. You can change the threshold level to
achieve different high-contrast effects.
The Threshold command can come in handy when you need to clean up
scans of line art, such as hand-drawn sketches, people’s signatures, pages
from a book, or even sheet music. Often, when you scan things on paper, the
slight color from the paper appears as a dull gray background in the scan.
By applying the Threshold command, you can adjust the tones in your
image to black and white and drop out the gray. Simply move the slider to
get your desired balance of white and black areas.
Posterize
This command reduces the number of colors in your image. Choose a value
between 2 and 255 colors. Lower values create an illustrative, poster look,
and higher values produce a more photo-realistic image.
Adjusting Clarity
After you’ve corrected the contrast and color and fixed your major flaws,
like scratches, wrinkles, and blemishes (as we describe in Chapter 1 of this
Book), you’re ready to finally work on the overall clarity of that image. If
your image suffers from an overall problem like dust, scratches, or artifacts
(blocky pixels or halos), you may need to employ the help of a filter. Then
finally, after you totally clean up your image, your last task is to give it a
good sharpening. Why wait until the very end to do so? Sometimes, while
you’re improving the contrast and color and getting rid of flaws, you can
reduce the clarity and sharpness of an image. So, you want to be sure that
your image is as soft as it’s going to get before you dive into sharpening. On
the other hand, keep in mind that sharpening itself increases contrast, so
depending on how much of your image you’re sharpening, you may need to
go back and fine-tune it by using the lighting adjustments described in the
section “Adjusting Lighting,” earlier in this chapter.
Lastly, we know we’ve been harping on the value of sharpening but, believe
it or not, you may also need to occasionally blur your image. Blurring can
eliminate unpleasant patterns that occur during scanning, soften distracting
backgrounds to give a better focal point, or even create the illusion of
motion.

Removing noise, artifacts, dust, and scratches
We know it sounds ironic, but the tools you use to eliminate unwanted
garbage from your images are found on the Filter➪Noise filter submenu in
Full Edit mode. With the exception of the Add Noise filter, the others actually
help to hide noise, dust, scratches, and artifacts. Here’s the list of cleaners:
 Despeckle: Decreases the contrast, without affecting the edges, to make
the dust in your image less pronounced. You may notice a slight blur-
ring of your image (that’s what’s hiding the garbage), but the edges
should still be sharp.
 Dust & Scratches: Hides, well, dust and scratches by blurring those
areas of your image that contain the gunk (it looks for harsh transitions
in tone). Specify your desired Radius value, which is the size of the area
to be blurred. Also, specify the Threshold value, which determines how
much contrast between pixels must be present before they’re blurred.
Use restraint with this filter. It can wipe out detail and make your image
look like mush.
 Median: Reduces contrast around dust spots. The process the filter
goes through is rather technical, but basically light spots darken, dark
spots lighten, and the rest of the image isn’t changed. Specify your
desired radius, which is the size of the area to be adjusted.
 Reduce Noise: Designed to remove luminance noise and artifacts from
your images. We used this filter to correct the original image (on the
left) in Figure 2-17, which had the nasty blockiness caused by JPEG
compression. Luminance noise is grayscale noise that makes images
look overly grainy. Specify these options to reduce the noise in your
image:
• Strength: Specify the amount of noise reduction.
• Preserve Details: A higher percentage preserves edges and details
but reduces the amount of noise that’s removed.
• Reduce Color Noise: Remove random colored pixels.
• Remove JPEG Artifact: Remove the blocks and halos that can occur
from low-quality JPEG compression.
Blurring when you need to
It may sound strange that anyone would intentionally want to blur an image.
But, if your photo is overly grainy or suffers from an ugly moiré pattern
(described in the following list), you may need to blur the image to correct
the problem. Also, occasionally, you may even want to blur the background
of an image to deemphasize distractions, or to make the foreground ele-
ments appear sharper and provide a better focal point.

Adjusting Clarity
501
Figure 2-17: Use the Reduce Noise filter to remove noise and artifacts.
All the blurring tools are accessed by choosing Filter➪Blur in Full Edit or
Quick Fix mode. The exception is the Blur tool, which we explain in Chapter 1
of this Book:
 Average: This one-step filter calculates the average value of the image
or selection and fills the area with that average value. You can use it for
smoothing overly noisy areas in your image.
 Blur: Another one-step filter, this one applies a fixed amount of blurring
to the whole image.
 Blur More: This one-step blur filter gives the same effect as Blur, but
more intensely.
 Motion Blur: This filter mimics the blur given off by moving objects.
Specify the angle of motion and the distance of the blur. Make sure to
select the Preview check box to see the effect while you enter the
values.
 Radial Blur: This filter produces a circular blur effect. Specify the
amount of blur you want. Choose the Spin method to blur along concen-
tric circular lines, as shown in the thumbnail. Or, choose Zoom to blur
along radial lines and mimic the effect of zooming in to your image.
Specify the desired Quality level. Because the Radial Blur filter is notori-
ously slow, Elements gives you the option of Draft (fast but grainy),
Good, or Best (slow but smooth). The difference between Good and
Best is evident only on large, high-resolution images. Finally, indicate
where you want the center of your blur by moving the blur diagram
thumbnail.
 Smart Blur: This filter provides several options to enable you to specify
how the blur is applied. Specify a value for the radius and threshold,
both defined in the following section. Start with a lower value for both
and adjust from there. Choose a quality setting from the pop-up menu.

Choose a mode setting. Normal blurs the entire image or selection.
Edge Only blurs only the edges of your elements and uses black and
white in the blurred pixels. Overlay Edge also blurs just the edges, but it
applies only white to the blurred pixels.
 Surface Blur: This filter blurs the surface, or interior, of the image,
rather than the edges. If you want to preserve your edge details but
blur everything else, this is the filter for you.
 Gaussian Blur: The last Blur filter we discuss is probably the one you’ll
use most often. It offers a Radius setting to let you adjust the amount of
blurring you desire.
Use the Gaussian Blur filter to camou-
flage moiré patterns on scanned
images. A moiré pattern is caused
when you scan halftone images. A
halftone is created when a continuous-
tone image, such as a photo, is digi-
tized and converted into a screen
pattern of repeating lines (usually
between 85 and 150 lines per inch) and
then printed. When you then scan that
halftone, a second pattern results and
is overlaid on the original pattern.
These two different patterns clash and
create an ugly moiré pattern. The
Gaussian Blur filter doesn’t eliminate
the moiré — it just merges the dots
and reduces the appearance of the pat-
tern, as shown in Figure 2-18. 
Sharpening for better
focus
Of course, if your images don’t need
any contrast, color, and flaw fixing,
feel free to move right into sharpening.
Sometimes, images captured by a
scanner or a digital camera are a little
soft, and it’s not due to any tonal adjustments. Occasionally, you may even
want to sharpen a selected area in your image just so that it becomes a
better focal point.
Keep in mind that you can’t really improve the focus of an image after it’s
captured. But you can do a decent job of faking it. All sharpening tools work
by increasing the contrast between adjacent pixels. This increased contrast
causes the edges to appear more distinct, thereby giving the illusion that
Figure 2-18: Blur your image to
emphasize a focal point.

Adjusting Clarity
503
the focus is improved, as shown in Figure 2-19. Remember that you can also
use the Sharpen tool for very small areas, as described in Chapter 1 of this
Book. Here’s the lowdown on sharpening commands:
Figure 2-19: Sharpening mimics an increase in focus by increasing 
contrast between adjacent pixels.
 Unsharp Mask: Unsharp Mask, in the Enhance menu in Full Edit or
Quick Fix mode, gives you several options that enable you to control the
amount of sharpening and the width of the areas to be sharpened. Use
them to nail your desired sharpening:
• Amount: Specify an amount (from 1 to 500%) of edge sharpening. The
higher the value, the more contrast between pixels around the
edges. Start with a value of 100 percent (or less), which usually gives
good contrast without appearing overly grainy.
• Radius: Specify the width (from .1 to 250 pixels) of the edges that the
filter will sharpen. The higher the value, the wider the edge. The
value you use is largely based on the resolution of your image. Low-
resolution images require a smaller radius value. High-resolution
images require a higher value.
Be warned that specifying a value that’s too high overemphasizes
the edges of your image and makes them appear thick and goopy.
A good rule of thumb in selecting a starting radius value is to divide
your image’s resolution by 150. For example, if you have a 300 ppi
image, set the radius at 2 and then use your eye to adjust from there.

Chapter 2

Color, and Clarity

Working Intelligently with the Smart Brush Tools
504
• Threshold: Specify the difference in brightness (from 0 to 255) that
must be present between adjacent pixels before the edge is sharp-
ened. A lower value sharpens edges with very little contrast differ-
ence. Higher values sharpen only when adjacent pixels are very
different in contrast. We recommend leaving Threshold set at 0
unless your image is very grainy. Increasing the value too much can
cause unnatural transitions between sharpened and unsharpened
areas.
Occasionally, the values you enter
for Amount and Radius may sharpen the image effectively but, in turn,
they can create excess grain, or noise, in your image. You can some-
times reduce this noise by increasing the Threshold value.
 Adjust Sharpness: Another sharp-
ening option is the Adjust
Sharpness command, as shown in
Figure 2-20. This feature enables
you to control the amount of
sharpening applied to shadow and
highlight areas. It also allows you
to select from various sharpening
algorithms.
Specify the following options:
• Amount and Radius: See the
two descriptions in the preced-
ing Unsharp Mask bullet.
• Remove: Choose your sharpening algorithm. Gaussian Blur is the
algorithm used for the Unsharp Mask command. Lens Blur detects
detail in the image and attempts to respect the details while reduc-
ing the nasty halos that can occur with sharpening. Motion Blur
tries to sharpen the blurring that occurs when your camera, or your
subject, moves. 
• Angle: Specify the direction of motion for the Motion Blur algorithm,
described in the preceding Remove bullet.
• More Refined: Runs the algorithm more slowly than the default
speed for better accuracy.
Working Intelligently with the Smart Brush Tools
The Smart Brush tools — Smart Brush and Detail Smart Brush — are two
great additions to Elements 7. These two tools enable you to selectively
apply an image adjustment or special effects that then appear on all or part
of your image. What’s great is that these adjustments and effects are
Figure 2-20: The Adjust Sharpness
command.

Working Intelligently with the Smart Brush Tools

applied via an adjustment layer, meaning that they “hover” over your layers
and don’t permanently alter the pixels in your image. The adjustments can
also be flexibly edited and deleted, if you so desire.
Using the Smart Brush
The Smart Brush tool allows you to paint a variety of image adjustments on
all or just a portion of your image. The action of the tool is similar to that of
the Selection Brush — as you brush, you make a selection and adjust simul-
taneously. Follow these steps to use the Smart Brush tool:
1. Select the Smart Brush tool from the Tools panel in Full Edit mode.
The tool icon looks like a house paintbrush with an adjacent gear.
2. Choose your desired brush attributes, such as diameter and hardness,
from the Brush Picker drop-down panel.
For more on working with brushes, see Book V, Chapter 1.
3. Select your desired adjustment category and then a particular preset
adjustment from the Smart Paint panel, as shown in Figure 2-21.
Note that you can “tear off” this panel by grabbing the grip area in the
upper-left corner of the panel and dragging it anywhere in your applica-
tion window. In the Smart Paint menu, choose adjustments ranging from
photographic effects, such as a vintage Yellowed Photo, to nature effects,
such as Sunset (which gives a warm, orange glow to your image).
4. Paint an adjustment on a layer in your image.
Note that while you paint, the Smart Brush tool attempts to detect
edges in your image and snaps to those edges. In addition, while you
brush, a selection border appears.
A new adjustment layer is automatically created with your first paint
stroke. The accompanying layer mask also appears on that adjustment
layer. For more on adjustment layers, see Book VI, Chapter 1.
5. Using the Add and Subtract Smart Brush modes, fine-tune your
adjusted area by adding and subtracting from it.
When you add and subtract from your adjusted area, you’re essentially
modifying your layer mask. Adding to the adjusted area adds white to
the layer mask, and subtracting from an adjusted area adds black to the
layer mask. For more on layer masks, see Book VI, Chapter 4.
6. Select a different preset adjustment for your selected area, if you
want.
In fact, try them all out before you make your final choice.

Edges option on the Options bar.
For more on Refine Edges, see Book IV, Chapter 2.
If you’d rather apply the adjustment to your unselected area, select the
Inverse option on the Options bar.
If you want to modify your adjustment, double-click the Adjustment
Layer pin on your image. The pin is annotated by a small, square black
and red gear icon. After you double-click the pin, the dialog box corre-
sponding to your particular adjustment appears. For example, if you
double-click the Shoebox photo adjustment (under Photographic), you
access the Hue/Saturation dialog box.
8. Make your necessary adjustments in the dialog box and click OK.
You can also right-click (Control-click on the Mac) and select Change
Adjustment Settings from the context menu that appears. Or, you can
select Delete Adjustment and Hide Selection from the same menu.
9. After you finish, simply deselect your selection by choosing
Select➪Deselect.

You can add multiple Smart Brush adjustments. After you apply one effect,
reset the Smart Brush tool and apply additional adjustments.
Getting accurate with the Detailed Smart Brush 
The Detailed Smart Brush tool also enables you to paint various image
adjustments on all or part of your image. The action of the tool is similar to
the regular Brush tool, enabling finer control than that of the Smart Brush.
Follow these steps to use the Detail Smart Brush tool:
1. Select the Detail Smart Brush tool from the Tools panel in Full Edit
mode.
This tool shares the flyout menu with the Smart Brush tool. The tool
icon looks like an art paintbrush with an adjacent gear.
2. Choose a brush tip preset and brush size as well as attributes from
the Brushes drop-down panel.
Feel free to change your brush tip and size as needed to achieve the
desired effect. For more on working with brushes, see Book V, Chapter 1.
For better accessibility, you can “tear off” this panel (and the Smart Paint
panel in Step 3) by grabbing the grip area in the upper-left corner of the
panel and dragging it anywhere in your application window.
3. Select your desired adjustment category and then your particular
preset adjustment from the Smart Paint panel.
Several of the Special Effect adjustments are shown in Figure 2-22.

ometimes, working with just a single shot isn’t quite enough. Imagine
this scenario: As much as you try, you just can’t quite squeeze that
vacation scenic vista into one photo; in fact, it takes a total of three shots.
Or one of your relations is always blinking or looking the wrong way in your
family reunion snapshots, so no single shot ends up being the perfect group
photo. Or maybe bystanders or cars keep crossing the path of your camera
when you’re trying to capture that historic landmark. Not to worry, that’s
what Elements’ Photomerge commands are for. One command seamlessly
stitches multiple shots of your panorama into a single image, while another
eliminates distracting elements from your shots, and a third command
enables you to combine multiple group shots to get the best composite.
Finally, one command even lets you take two faces and combine
them into a kind of hybrid human. (How cool is that?)
Stitching a Scene with 
Photomerge Panorama
The Photomerge Panorama command enables you
to combine multiple images into a single panoramic
image.You can take several overlapping photos, from
skylines to mountain ranges, and stitch them together
into one shot.
If you know your ultimate goal is to create a Photomerge
composition, you can make things easier for yourself by
making sure that when you shoot your photos, you overlap your
individual images by 15 to 40 percent, but no more than 50 percent. Adobe

Stitching a Scene with Photomerge Panorama

also recommends that you avoid using distortion lenses (such as a fish-eye)
and that you also avoid using your camera’s zoom setting. Additionally, try to
keep the same exposure settings for even lighting. Finally, try to stay in the
same position and keep your camera at the same level for each shot. Using a
tripod and rotating the head can help you achieve this consistency. Note,
however, that rotating the head may introduce a perspective distortion. This
can be corrected during the “stitching” described in the steps below.
Follow these steps to assemble your own Photomerge Panorama composition:
1. In the Editor, in Full Edit mode, choose File➪New➪Photomerge
Panorama.
2. In the first Photomerge dialog box, shown in Figure 3-1, select your
source files.
You can select from Files (which uses individual files you select) or
from Folder (which uses all images in a folder) from the Use drop-down
list. Click the Add Open Files button to use all currently open files. Or
click the Browse button to navigate to certain files or folders.
Figure 3-1: Select the source files for your composition.
3. Under Layout, select a projection mode, as shown in Figure 3-1.
The thumbnail illustration visually demonstrates each mode, but we
give you a little more description of each here:

Stitching a Scene with Photomerge Panorama
511
• Auto: Using the Auto mode, Elements analyzes your images on its own.
• Perspective: Select this mode if your images have been shot with 
perspective or at acute angles. This is also a good mode to use if you
have shot images using the tripod method described earlier in this
section.
• Cylindrical: Select this option if you shot images with a wide-angle lens.
This mode is also good for those 360-degree, full panoramic shots.
• Reposition Only: When you select this mode, Elements doesn’t take
into account any distortion, but merely scans the images and posi-
tions them in what it considers the best position.
If you choose any of the preceding modes, Elements opens and auto-
matically assembles the source files to create the composite panorama
in the work area of the dialog box. If it looks good, skip to Step 7.
Elements alerts you if it can’t automatically composite your source
files. You then have to assemble the images manually by using the
Interactive Layout mode. 
• Interactive Layout: This option opens the work area pane. Elements
tries to align and stitch the images the best it can, but you may have
to manually complete or adjust the panorama, as shown in Figure 3-2.
If you choose the Interactive Layout option, proceed to Step 4.
Note that, with any of the modes, Elements leaves your merged image in
layers. Also notice that a layer mask has been added to each layer to
better blend the panoramic image. For more on layer masks, see Book VI.
4. If Elements hasn’t already done so for you, drag the image thumb-
nails from the lightbox area (the small white area at the top) onto the
work area with the Select Image tool (the arrow), or simply double-
click the lightbox thumbnail to add it to the composition.
5. Arrange and position your images using one or more of the following
tools:
• Select Image tool: Positions the images
• Rotate Image tool: Makes rotations
• Zoom and Move View tools: Help view and navigate around your
panorama, respectively
• Navigator View box: Zooms into and out of your composition when
you drag the slider

6. To adjust the Vanishing Point, first select the Perspective option in
the Settings area and click the image with the Set Vanishing Point tool. 
A vanishing point is the point on the horizon where perspective planes
recede and eventually converge. By default, Elements selects the center
image as the vanishing point. If necessary, you can move the other images.
Note that when you select the Perspective setting, Elements links non–
Vanishing Point images to the Vanishing Point image. To break the link,
click the Normal Setting button or separate the images in the work area.
7. Click OK to create the panorama.

Getting a group of people to smile, not blink or fidget, and look in the same
direction is about as easy as herding cats. With Elements, you no longer
have to worry about snapping the perfect group shot anymore. Just take a
bunch of shots and later create the ultimate perfect shot by compositing
those shots using Photomerge Group Shot.
Here are the steps to create a Photomerge Group Shot image:
1. In any of the Edit modes, select two or more photos from your Photo
Bin at the bottom of your application window.
2. Choose File➪New➪Photomerge Group Shot.
The Photomerge Group Shot dialog box appears.
3. Take your best overall group shot and drag it from the Photo Bin onto
the Final pane.
4. Select another photo in the Photo Bin to use as your Source image.
Drag it to the Source pane.

5. With the Pencil tool, draw a line around the portions of the Source
photo you want to merge into your Final photo, as shown in Figure 3-4.
In the Options area on the right side of the dialog box, you can choose
to show the yellow pencil strokes (Show Strokes) or show regions
(Show Regions), which are then highlighted with a blue overlay. Use the
Eraser tool to remove any portions you don’t want merged onto the
final image.
6. Repeat Steps 4 and 5 with any remaining photos.
If your photos aren’t aligned, you can use the Alignment tool under
Advanced Options.
7. Using the Alignment tool, click the Source image and position the
three target markers on three key locations.
Do the same on the final image and choose similar locations.
You can click the Pixel Blending option to better blend pixels.
8. Click the Align Photos button.
Again, as with Photomerge Panorama, the better the source images are
(similar framing, similar size, similar lighting), the better the merged result.

Manipulating Image DNA with Photomerge Faces
Photomerge Faces — admittedly more of a fun tool than a useful one — lets
you blend features from multiple faces to get a kind of hybrid face.
To create a hybrid human by using the Photomerge Faces feature, follow
these steps:
1. Select two or more photos from your Photo Bin.
2. Choose File➪New➪Photomerge Faces in any of the Edit modes.
The Photomerge Faces dialog box appears.
3. Choose the face you want to have as your “canvas” (or starting image)
and drag it from the Photo Bin onto the Final pane.
4. Select one of your other photos in the Photo Bin to use as the Source
image. Drag it to the Source pane.

5. With the Alignment tool, click the Source image and position the
three target markers on the eyes and mouth of the face, and then do
the same on the Final image.
6. Click the Align Photos button.
This command sizes the images to better match and align the features.
It’s always best to start with similarly sized, framed, and oriented
images. Shooting the images in similar lighting helps, as well.
7. With the Pencil tool, draw a line around the features of the Source
photo that you want to merge into your Final photo, as shown in
Figure 3-6.
In the Options area on the right side of the dialog box, you can choose
to show your blue pencil strokes (Show Strokes) or show your regions
(Show Regions), which are then highlighted with a blue overlay. Use the
Eraser tool to remove any portions of the face you don’t want merged
onto your final image.

Eliminating with Photomerge Scene Cleaner
Photomerge Scene Cleaner sounds like a covert job with the CIA where you
spend your days mopping up evidence at crime scenes, but it isn’t quite that
intriguing. This latest addition to the Photomerge command tool set enables
you to create the optimum image by allowing you to eliminate annoying dis-
tractions, such as cars, passersby, and so on.
To get the best Source images for a “clean scene,” be sure to take multiple
shots of your scene from the same angle and distance. It also works best
when the elements you want to eliminate are moving.
Follow these steps to create a Photomerge Scene Cleaner composite:
1. Select two or more photos from your Photo Bin.
2. Choose File➪New➪Photomerge Scene Cleaner in any of the Edit modes.
The Photomerge Scene Cleaner dialog box appears.
Elements attempts to auto-align your images the best it can.
3. Take your best overall shot of the scene and drag it from the Photo
Bin onto the Final pane.

photo that you want to be replaced by content from the Source photo,
as shown in Figure 3-8.
Figure 3-8: Create the ideal photo from multiple shots with Photomerge 
Scene  Cleaner.
6. Repeat Steps 4 and 5 with the remaining shots of the scene.
If your photos aren’t aligned, you can use the Alignment tool under the

7. Using the Alignment tool, click the Source image and position the
three target markers on three key locations.
Do the same on the Final image, choosing similar locations.
8. Click the Align Photos button.
Again, as with the other Photomerge commands, the more similar the
starting source images (similar framing, similar angle, similar lighting),
the better the merged result will be.
9. If you make a mess of things, click the Reset button.
10. When you’re satisfied with the result, click Done.
The cleaned-up image opens as a new file in Elements. You have to admit,
for a command that is so easy to use, the results are pretty impressive, as
shown in Figure 3-9.

Be sure to check the perimeter edges of your composite image carefully. You
may have some strange artifacts or blurring caused by the aligning of the
multiple images. Execute a quick crop with the Cropping tool and you’re
good to go.

W
ouldn’t it be nice if you could have a mentor sitting behind you who
could walk you through the necessary steps each time you encoun-
tered a new feature in a program?
Photoshop Elements doesn’t provide you with a robot mentor to
instruct you on the best way to perform an edit, but it does offer
you the next best thing in the form of the Guided panel.
The Guided panel provides you easy control over
some important editing tasks that you perform rou-
tinely when working on images. In this chapter, we
show you how to use the Guided panel and all it
has to offer you.

Understanding Guided Mode
522
Understanding Guided Mode
You see all the guided actions and
activities in the Guided panel in Full
Edit mode. Click Guided in the Panel
Bin, and the Guided panel opens to
display the items shown in Figure 4-1.
As you can see in Figure 4-1, the
Guided panel has seven categories.
Below each category title, you find
some items that relate to the respec-
tive category. The categories include
 Basic Photo Edits: Here you find
the kinds of edits frequently used
on photos. Cropping images,
straightening photos, and sharpen-
ing photos are part of this group. 
 Lighting and Exposure: Almost all
photos you either take with cam-
eras or scan from printed pictures
require some lighting adjustments.
You find lighten, darken, as well as
brightness and contrast controls
here. In addition, it offers help to
use Levels for more brightness
and contrast adjustments.
 Color Correction: Another fre-
quently used edit involves adjust-
ing color. You can enhance colors,
remove color casts, and correct
skin tones using these items.
 Guided Activities: This item helps
you make adjustments for enhanc-
ing images with instructions for
removing scratches, blemishes, tear marks, and correcting distortions.
The Guide for Editing a Photo walks you through several edits for crop-
ping, brightness adjustments, enhancing, and touchups.
 Photomerge: Photomerge is used for merging photos. The sub cate-
gories include help with merging group shots or pictures with faces. It
shows you how to remove obstructing objects from a group of merged
photos using the Scene Cleaner.
Figure 4-1: The Guided panel.

Basic Photo Edits
523
 Automated Actions: A host of different sequences are assembled
together as actions. You can, for example, choose one or a group of
photos and apply a sepia tone with just one mouse click. The action
then applies several editing steps automatically to create a good result.
 Photographic Effects: Using this guide you can easily apply a variety of
different filters that produce many different effects, such as line draw-
ings, transformation of your image into an old-fashioned photo, or satu-
rated film effects.
Basic Photo Edits
The Guide helps you perform the kinds of basic edits frequently used in
most of your Elements editing sessions. When you choose Crop Photo, for
example, the Guide panel opens with the Crop tool selected and a crop
frame drawn on the photo. Instructions that make it easy for you to crop an
image appear in the Guided panel.
Similar steps are also provided for straightening a photo. You might use this
feature frequently when scanning photos.
The last item listed under Basic Photo Edits is Sharpen Photo. This is another
edit you make frequently when working on your photos in Elements. To get a
feel for using the Sharpen Photo item in Guided mode, do the following:
1. Open a photo in Full Edit mode.
2. Open the Guided panel by clicking Guided in the Panel Bin.
3. Click Sharpen Photo.
The panel changes to display the options you have for sharpening a
photo.
4. Change the view in the Image window.
By default, you see your photo appear in the Image window in a maxi-
mized view. You can view your photo with a before/after effect where
the original photo appears unedited on the left side of the window and
the edits you apply appear on the right side of the window. To create a
before/after effect, click the up-pointing arrow where you see After Only.
When you click the up-pointing arrow, the icon changes to two icons
adjacent to each other and the name changes to Before & After –
Horizontal, as shown in Figure 4-2.
If you want to view the before/after images vertically, click the Before &
After – Horizontal icon, and the view changes with the Before image
appearing vertically on top of the After image.

Figure 4-2: Click After Only and you can see a before/after display of 
the original and the edited version beside each other.
5. Adjust the sharpening slider.
You have the option of clicking the Auto button, and Elements makes a
best-guess adjustment to sharpen the image. To manually sharpen the
image, move the slider left and right.
6. Click Done to apply the edits.
The advantage you have in using the Guided panel is that some helpful
information is offered to guide you through the edits. Note that in the panel
shown in Figure 4-2, you see a tip informing you that it’s best to view your
photo in a 100% view when you apply sharpening to a photo.
Lighting and Exposure
One of the most important and most-frequent edits you make on photos 
is adjusting lighting and exposure. When you click Lighting and Exposure
and view the options, the first two items you see deal with handling
Lighten/Darken and Brightness/Contrast issues. Clicking one of these 

Lighting and Exposure
525
items changes the panel view to one
where you can move sliders similar to
those you have for sharpening adjust-
ments. The tweaks you can do here 
are pretty straightforward and, with 
the help offered in the panel, it’s intu-
itive and easy to make these kinds of
adjustments.
Things get a bit more complicated
when you start using the Levels adjust-
ment. We go into quite a bit of detail
about Levels in Book VIII, Chapter 2. Be
sure to read that chapter when you
want to learn more about using this
important dialog box.
When you use Levels, it’s commonly
used on Adjustment Layers. You find
more information on creating and 
using Adjustment Layers in Book VI,
Chapter 1.
Creating an Adjustment Layer and
applying settings from the Levels dialog
box can be a little confusing when you
first start correcting lighting and expo-
sure. The Guided panel, fortunately,
breaks down the complicated steps
into easy-to-follow instructions to 
assist you in making the edits.
When you click Adjust Levels in the
Guided panel, the panel view changes
to what you see in Figure 4-3. Here you
find helpful information explaining how
the Levels dialog box is used and what
the histograms mean. When you start
with this edit, it’s a good idea to read 
all the help information before making the adjustments.

Type a name for the new Adjustment Layer and click OK and the Levels
dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 4-5.
Figure 4-5: The Levels dialog box.

Color Correction
527
From the information you obtained in the Guided panel, move the sliders in
the Levels dialog box to make your corrections.
Color Correction
The three items you find in the Color
Correction panel help you improve the
color in your photos. When you click
the Enhance Colors item, the panel
changes to provide you sliders to 
adjust hue, saturation, and brightness. 
Click the Remove a Color Cast link and
you find an eyedropper tool where you
can sample a medium gray tone, and
Elements corrects color in the image.
For more information on removing
color casts, see Book VIII, 
Chapter 2.
One of the most important color
adjustments you can make is adjusting
skin tones. The Adjust Skin Tones
panel shown in Figure 4-6 provides you
with an eyedropper tool. Click an area
in the image representing a neutral
skin tone, and the color is adjusted to
match that neutral tone for the entire
image. 
When adjusting skin tones it’s a good
idea to select only the areas you want
to correct for color adjustments. Look
over Book IV, Chapter 1 to learn how to
make selections.
You can tweak the color for skin 
tones by moving the sliders in the
panel.

Guided Activities
528
Guided Activities
Guided activities provide you with 
several different options. When 
you click Touch Up Scratches,
Blemishes, or Tear Marks, the 
Touch Up Photo panel opens, as
shown in Figure 4-7.
Move the sliders respective to the
edits you want to make. As with 
other panels, you find some help 
information to guide you through 
the steps. We cover much more on
touching up images in Book VIII,
Chapters 1 and 2.
If you move down the Guided
Activities list and click Guide for
Editing a Photo, the Guided panel
changes to first display the Crop
panel. You make a choice for cropping
an image and click the Next button.
You move on to Lighten or Darken a
Photo. Click Next and you move on to
the Touch Up Photo panel, and so on.
This panel is one that takes you
through the entire editing process,
and what you find in each step is a
duplicate of many of the other panels
discussed in this chapter.
The Fix Keystone Distortion panel
helps you correct problems with 
architectural photography with 
parallax distortion. To understand 
the distortion problem, look over
Figure 4-7: The Touch Up Photo panel.

Figure 4-8. The image previews show
you a sample photo (at the top of the
panel) and the result of applying the
correction (in the bottom photo in the
panel).
Photomerge
We devote a complete chapter to
Photomerge in Book VIII, Chapter 3 so
we won’t go into the steps to produce
a photo merged from other photos in
this chapter. The Photomerge panel
helps you walk through all the steps
we explain there.
You select several photos you want to
merge and then use the Photomerge
panel to align and merge the photos.
The content of your images can be
scenes or faces. The Scene Cleaner is
used to remove items that distract
from the merged scene. 
Automated Actions
The Action Player is like having a tape
recorder play a recorded series of
steps to produce a result. You might
have one effect that requires creating a
layer, adjusting brightness on the new
layer, changing layer opacity, adjusting
hue/saturation and brightness, adding
some noise, applying a filter, and flat-
tening the layers. Rather than perform
each step manually, you can use the
Action Player that applies multiple
edits with one mouse click.

To see how the Action Player is used, follow these steps:
1. Open a photo in Full Edit mode.
2. Click Guided to open the Guided panel.
3. Click Action Player to open the Acton Player panel.
4. Choose an Action.
From the first drop-down list choose an action. In our example, we
chose Special Effects.
5. Select the action to run.
From the second drop-down list, choose an action you want to run.
6. Click Play Action.
Elements performs all the steps necessary to create the result. In our
example, when we choose to run Sepia Toning with Grain, the action
creates the image shown in Figure 4-9.
7. Click Done.
Figure 4-9: The result of running the action.

Photographic Effect
531
Photographic Effect
Photographic effects are like applying filters that we cover extensively in
Book VII, Chapters 1 and 2. Whereas the Filters panel provides you with
many different options to apply a filter, the Guided panel offers you filter
effects and then takes you through steps for adjusting brightness values,
changing hue/saturation, and making other adjustments to perfect the 
result.
You can choose from three different options for applying Photographic
Effects. Line Drawing converts your photos to a pen-and-ink drawing. Old
Fashioned Photos gives your images a vintage appearance, and Saturated
Film Effect provides you a way to simulate colors of the saturated film used
in film cameras (as opposed to digital cameras).
To experiment a little, let’s take a look at the Old Fashioned Photos option
and follow these steps to produce an image with a vintage appearance:
1. Open an image in Full Edit mode.
2. Click Guided to open the Guided panel.
3. Click Old Fashioned Photo to open the Create an Old Fashioned
Photo panel, as shown in Figure 4-10.

P
hotos are meant to be shared with others or
printed using both desktop and professional
printing devices. In Chapters 1 and 4 of this book,
we take you through the journey of sharing photos
online, using the Photoshop.com sharing service
and some additional third-party services that can
help you create professional-looking presentations.
In Chapter 2, we cover all you need to know about
printing your pictures, managing the color, and
using color proﬁles. As for Chapter 3, we devote
that one to covering Web-hosting images.

A
dobe Photoshop Elements offers you a number of creations that can
be shared onscreen or in print. From both the Create and Share panels
in the Panel Bin in the Organizer and from within both editing modes,
you have a number of menu choices for producing creations
designed for sharing.
In Book IX, Chapter 3, we look at creating files 
for screen and Web viewing. In this chapter, 
we talk about creations designed for print and 
sharing. 
Getting a Handle on Creations
In Book IX, Chapter 4, we talk about online albums,
attaching files to e-mail, using photo mail, creating
CDs and DVDs, and using online sharing services. All

Getting a Handle on Creations

these creations offer different output options, such as e-mailing, burning
files to disc, and creating HTML documents — as well as printing and PDF
creation — and you create all of them using the Share panel.
You work with the remaining 
creations — photo books, photo col-
lages, photo calendars, greeting cards,
print labels, and photo stamps — by
choosing options from the Create
panel shown in Figure 1-1. All these
creations are designed for output to
your printer or for sending files to an
online printing service, or to friends
and family.
When you make a creation that will
ultimately be sent to an online service
or shared with other users, keep in
mind that you first must select the
photos you want in your creation. For
example, creating a photo book by
clicking the Photo Book button in the
Create panel first requires you to let
Elements know what photos are to be
used in your photo book. If you
happen to click a button and nothing
happens, more than likely, you haven’t
selected any photos.
Many creation options follow a similar
set of steps to produce a file that will
be shared with other users or sent to
an online printing service. In the Panel
Bin, you find all you need to make a
new project. It gives you choices for
layouts and producing a creation.
Some of the choices from both the Create and Share panels are
 Layout options: Select some photos in the Organizer and click an item,
such as Photo Book, to make the Create panel change to the Project
view. This view displays some information about making a new creation.
 Auto-Fill with Project Bin Photos: This check box is selected by
default, and the files you see in the Project Bin are added to your 
project.
Figure 1-1: The Create panel.

539
 Include Captions: Select this check box if you want the photo captions
to appear on each page below their respective photos.
 Number of Pages: Elements automatically creates the number of pages
to accommodate the number of photos you selected in the Organizer.
Note that some creations require a minimum number of photos to 
produce a project. Photo Book, for example, requires a minimum of 
18 pages.
After assembling your creation, click the Create button. Elements then incor-
porates the selected photos into the layout and theme you specified in the
panel. Be patient and wait for Elements to complete the task.
After a creation has been made, the document appears like any other image
you open in Elements. You can crop, modify, print, and more. Using an
Elements file, you choose File➪Save to open the Save As dialog box. Type a
name and click Save.
Creating a Photo Book
Elements provides some fancy ways to create pages for a photo album. The
Photo Book Creation panel offers many different options for choosing page
templates, adding artwork and type, printing your album pages, or sending
the files to an online service for professional printing.
Follow these steps to create a photo book:
1. Select files in the Organizer and click the Create tab.
The procedure for all creations is the same. You first select files in the
Organizer (or an editing mode) and then click the Create tab in the
Panel Bin. Ideally, it’s best to create an album, as we explain in Book II,
Chapter 2, and click the album to display the album photos in the
Organizer window. But remember, after you display an album in the
Organizer, you still need to select all the photos.
To select all photos shown in an Organizer window, press Ctrl+A.

panes that walk you through the
steps to create a photo book. If
you start in the Organizer, clicking
Photo Book in the Create panel
opens your selected photos in Full

3. Choose a photo for the title page.
By default, the first photo in the
Project Bin in Full Edit mode is 
the photo that’s used for the title
page in your photo book. To
change that photo to a different

in the Project Bin to the first 
position.
4. Click Next and choose a layout.

Use the Text tool in the special
Tools panel shown on the left side
of the photo book preview (refer
to Figure 1-5) to add text to the
book pages.
9. As with any other Elements file,
choose File➪Save to save the
project.
When you choose File➪Save or Save As, you have an option to save
your photo book as a project or a PDF file. The default file type is Photo
Project Format (*.PSE). Open the Format drop-down list and you can
choose Acrobat PDF (*.PDF, *.PDP). If you choose PDF for the file
format, you can easily e-mail and share your photo book with others.
Recipients of your photo book only need the free Adobe Reader soft-
ware to view and print from it.

EasyShare, see “Making a Photo Calendar” later in this chapter.)
All the options in the Artwork panel are used in the same manner. For exam-
ple, if you want to change the background artwork, choose Backgrounds
from the menu shown in Figure 1-6 — where you see the By Seasons drop-
down list. Click a background from the panel and drag the background to
the page you want to edit. (Note you can also select a background and click
the Apply button.) When adding frames and shadows to your pictures,
choose Frames from the menu and drag a frame to a picture on a page, or
select a frame and click Apply.
Elements provides you with many different editing options for creating the
design for your photo pages. Try to spend some time choosing different
options in the Artwork panel and drag items (or select them and click
Apply) to the pages to see how easy it is to change the appearance of your
photo book.
After you create a photo book, you can print the album pages to your desk-

ing though the post office.
Here’s the simple, easy way to use Elements to place an order for your very
own personal postage stamps:
1. Select an image in the Organizer.
Your file needs to be less than 5MB. (See Book III, Chapter 1 for more on
resizing images.)
2. Click Create in the Panel Bin, and then choose PhotoStamps from the
More Options drop-down menu.
The PhotoStamps dialog box opens.
3. Click the Upload My Photos button in the dialog box (see 
Figure 1-20).
Your photo is uploaded to the PhotoStamps.com Web site.

The PhotoStamps.com Web site provides an easy-to-use interface for
ordering stamps. After you fill out the order and provide billing informa-
tion, your stamps are mailed to you.
Getting Organized with CD/DVD Labels
Another creation option in Elements is a simple, easy way to create CD and
DVD labels. From the Create panel, choose a menu item for CD Jacket, DVD
Jacket, or CD/DVD Label from the More Options drop-down menu. From tem-
plates provided in the panel, Elements offers you an easy method for print-
ing your own, personalized labels and jackets for CDs and DVDs.
This feature for printing CD/DVD labels is a bit weak in Elements. You may
need to fiddle around quite a bit to get the images to fit a label. Using some
templates provided by the label developers is often a much better method
for printing labels.
Creating a VCD with Menu
Select a slideshow project and open the Create panel. From the More
Options drop-down list, choose VCD with Menu. The Create a VCD with
Menu dialog box opens as shown in Figure 1-21. Select a project, make a
choice for NTSC or PAL format, and click Burn. The file created is a Video CD
with a menu you can control with your DVD player’s remote control device.

At the bottom of the More Options drop-down menu in the Create panel,
you can find a command for Flipbook. If you want to create a quick little
video that shows off your photos by flashing stills on your screen or your
TV set, you can quickly create a flipbook. Here’s how you do it:
1. Open the Organizer and select the files you want to use.
Note that you must select at least two files in order to create the flipbook.
2. Click the Create tab in the Panel Bin and choose Flipbook from the
More Options drop-down menu.
The Photoshop Elements Video Flipbook dialog box opens, as shown in
Figure 1-22.
3. Set the playback speed by typing a value in the Speed text box or
moving the slider to the desired speed.
Note that flipping through photos looks best at low speeds, such as one
or two frames per second (fps). Also, you can select the size for your
video file from options on the Movie File Size drop-down menu. As file
sizes are reduced, the download speeds when sharing files on the
Internet increase. To get familiar with the file size that works best for
you, experiment a little by saving files at different sizes.

4. Click Output.
The Save Video Flipbook dialog box opens.
5. Type a filename and click Save.
Your file is written as a .wmv file. You can use Microsoft Movie Maker to
write the file to a CD or DVD.
Figure 1-22: The Photoshop Elements Video Flipbook dialog box permits 
you to select a speed and movie file size.
The WMV format is not recognized by many DVD players. You may need to
convert the file format to a format recognized by your DVD player. Do an

In This Chapter
 Preparing images for printing
 Printing multiple images
 Using color profiles
 Printing color from different printers
 Using service providers
 Using online printing services
 Exploring other print options
P
erhaps the greatest challenge for individuals using programs such as
Photoshop Elements (and even for the professionals who use its grand-
daddy, Adobe Photoshop) is turning what you see on your monitor into a
reasonable facsimile on a printed page. You can find all sorts of books on
color printing — how to get color right, how to calibrate your equipment,
and how to create and use color profiles — all for the purpose of getting a
good match between your computer monitor and your printer. It’s down-
right discouraging to spend a lot of time tweaking an image so that all the
brilliant blue colors jump out on your computer monitor, only to
find that all those blues turn to murky purples when the
photo is printed.
If you’ve already read Book III, Chapters 1 and 2,
you’re ahead of the game because you know a little
bit about color management, color profiles, and
printer resolutions. After you check out those chap-
ters, your next step is to get to know your printer
or your print service center and understand how to
correctly print your pictures.
In this chapter, we talk about options — many
options — for setting print attributes for printing to
your own color printer. We also toss in some tips on how
to get better results when you’re using print service cen-
ters. If you need to, reread this chapter a few times just to be
certain that you understand the process for printing good-quality
images. A little time spent here will, we hope, save you some headaches
down the road.

Getting Images Ready for Printing
560
Getting Images Ready for Printing
The first step toward getting your photos to your desktop printer or to a
printing service is to prepare each image for optimum output. You have sev-
eral considerations when you’re preparing files, including the ones in this list:
 Set resolution and size. Before you print a file, use the Image Size
dialog box (Image➪Resize➪Image Size) to set your image size and the
optimum resolution for your printer. Files that have too much resolu-
tion can print images that are inferior to files optimized for a printer.
See your printer’s documentation for recommendations for resolution.
As a general rule, 300 ppi (pixels per inch) works best for most printers
printing on high-quality paper. If you print on plain paper, you often find
that lower resolutions work just as well or even better.
 Make all brightness and color corrections before printing. It stands to
reason that you want to make sure that your pictures appear their best
before sending them off to your printer. If you have your monitor prop-
erly calibrated, as we discuss in Book III, Chapter 4, you should see a
fair representation of what your pictures will look like after they are
printed.
 Decide how color will be managed before you print. You can color-
manage output to your printer in three ways, as we discuss in the next
section. Know your printer’s profiles and how to use them before you
start to print your files.
 Get your printer ready. Finally, when printing to desktop color printers
always be certain your ink cartridges have ink and the nozzles are
clean. Make sure you use the proper settings for paper and ink when
you send a file to your printer. Be sure to review the manual that came
with your printer to become aware of how to perform all the steps
required to make a quality print.
Setting Print Options
As you might suspect, you print files from Elements using the File➪Print
command. Depending on what workspace you have open, you can set print
options in the Print dialog box from the Organizer or from within Full Edit
mode. The different modes provide you with some different options, so we
want to look at printing from both the Organizer and Full Edit mode.
You have a number of different settings to adjust when printing color
photos as we explain a little later in the section “Printing with Color
Profiles.” For now, let’s have a look at the different options you have in the
print dialog boxes you open from the Organizer and from Full Edit mode.

Setting Print Options
561
Printing from the Organizer
You can select one or more images in the Organizer and then choose File➪
Print. The images selected when you choose the Print command appear in a
scrollable list, as shown in Figure 2-1. Options you have in the Print Photos
dialog box include
Figure 2-1: Thumbnails of selected images appear in the Print Photos dialog box.
 Image Thumbnails: When you select multiple images in the Organizer,
all the selected images appear in a scrollable window on the left side of
the dialog box.
 Scroll bar: When so many photos are selected that they all cannot be
viewed in the thumbnail list on the left side of the dialog box, you can
use the scroll bar to see all images.
 Add/Remove: If the Print Photos dialog box is open and you want to add
more photos to print, click the Add (+) icon and the Add Photos dialog
box opens as shown in Figure 2-2. A list of thumbnails appears, showing
all photos in the current open catalog. Check the check boxes adjacent to
the thumbnails to indicate the photos you want to add to your print
queue. You can also choose an entire catalog, albums, photos marked
with keyword tags, and photos having a rating. For more information on
albums, keyword tags, and ratings, see Book II, Chapter 2.

 P.I.M.: Print Image Matching. If your printer supports P.I.M. and Exif
color matching, you can often see improved results.
 Exif Print: This option is available for digital cameras and printers 
supporting Exif for better-quality prints.
 Type of Prints: You have three options available. Print Individual Prints,
Contact Sheets, or Picture Packages. For more information on Contact
Sheets and Picture Packages, see “Printing Multiple Images” later in this
chapter.
 Print Size: Select from the number of options for print sizes supported
by your printer.
 Photos Per Page: By default, One Photo Per Page is selected. Remove

down printing, where the negative and the image are flipped.
 Print Crop Marks: Check this box to print crop marks.
 Max Print Resolution: All printers can take advantage of a resolution
up to a maximum value, and that value varies among different printers.
You can set this option to the maximum resolution supported by your
printer. When files are sent to the printer, they are downsampled if the
resolution is larger than the value in this text box. The result is that less
data is sent to the printer, yielding faster print times.

Printing Multiple Images
You have two choices in the Organizer for printing multiple images. Neither
option, printing contact sheets or picture packages, is available from within
Full Edit mode.
Printing contact sheets
Contact sheets in traditional photography were used to get a print from a
roll of film. Rather than viewing negatives, a photographer could see a
thumbnail print of each frame on a roll in a few contact sheets. These
revealed how the frames would appear when printed.
You can get the same results in Elements by printing contact sheets from a
collection of photos. When you can look over the thumbnails and choose
which photos to print at larger sizes, you are saving money on your printer
consumables.
To print a contact sheet, do the following:
1. Open the Organizer.
2. Select photos in the Organizer you want to print on a contact sheet.
Click and press Ctrl + click to choose multiple photos in a noncontigu-
ous selection. You can also sort photos by keyword tags, albums, dates,
and so on. You then select all the sorted photos by pressing Ctrl+A. For
more information on sorting files see Book II, Chapter 2.
3. Choose File➪Print or press Ctrl+P.
The Print Photos dialog box opens. In the dialog box select the printer
you want to use for your output from the Select Printer drop-down list.
4. Choose Contact Sheet from the Select Type of Print drop-down menu. 
The Print Photos dialog box refreshes to show your Contact Sheet
options, as shown in Figure 2-6.
5. Select a layout.
Choose the number of columns you want for the contact sheet. If you
specify fewer columns, the images appear larger; as more columns are
selected the images appear smaller. Choose a size according to the
number of columns that you want to print.

Printing picture packages
Another option you have for printing multiple photos is picture packages.
This feature prints multiple copies of the same photo or multiple copies of
many photos. 
A picture package is typically a single sheet of paper with the same photo
printed at different sizes — something like your graduation photos or prom
photos. You can choose to print a single picture package from one photo
selected in the Organizer, or you can select multiple photos and print them
all as multiple picture packages.
To create a picture package, do the following:
1. Open the Organizer.
2. Select a single photo or multiple photos in the Organizer that you
want to print as a picture package(s).
3. Choose File➪Print or press Ctrl/Ô+P.
The Print Photos dialog box opens. In the dialog box, select the printer
you want to use for your output from the Select Printer drop-down list.
4. Choose Picture Package from the Select Type of Print drop-down list.

Printing with Color Profiles
All the options we talked about so far in this chapter give you a picture on
paper, but even if you follow all the steps up to this point to a T, you may
still not get the color right. You need to do more than adjust the settings in
the Print Photos and Print dialog boxes to print the most accurate color you
can on your printer. To do so requires using printer profiles that are created
for every printer, paper, and ink set you use.
Printer profiles are created by printer developers for use with their inks and
papers. If you decide to modify your printer and use large ink bottles or use
lower-cost inks from third-party suppliers, the profiles shipped by your
printer developer aren’t optimized for the change in ink pigments. Likewise,
third-party papers aren’t optimized for the printer profiles shipped by your
printer developer. In order to get accurate color when you use inks and
papers different from those recommended by your printer developer, you
may need to develop custom profiles for each ink set and each paper. You
can find several sources of services that create custom profiles for you by
searching the Internet.

Working with color printer profiles
In Book III, Chapter 4, we talk about creating color profiles for your monitor
and selecting a color workspace. The final step in a color-managed workflow
is to convert color from the profile of your color workspace to the color 
profile of your printer. Basically, this conversion means that the colors you
see on your monitor in your current workspace are accurately converted to
the color that can be reproduced by your printer. 
Understanding how Elements uses color profiles
When using the Print dialog box (or the More Options section of the Print
Photos dialog box), you can manage color in Photoshop Elements in one of
three ways when it comes time to print your files:
 Printer Manages Colors: This method permits your printer to decide
which profile is used when your photo is printed to your desktop color
printer. Your printer makes this decision according to the paper you
select as the source paper used to print your photos. If you choose
Epson Premium Glossy Photo Paper, for example, your printer chooses
the profile that goes along with that particular paper. If you choose
another paper, your printer chooses a different color profile. This
method is all automatic, and color profile selection is made when you
print your file.
 Photoshop Elements Manages Color: When you make this choice, color
management is taken away from your printer and is controlled by
Elements. You must choose a color profile after making this choice in
the Print dialog box. Desktop printers that fall in the medium-to-more-
expensive range often have many color profiles they can install. 
 No Color Management: You use this choice if you have a color profile
embedded in one of your pictures. You’ll probably rarely use this
option. Unless you know how to embed profiles or receive files with
embedded profiles from other users, don’t make this choice in the Print
dialog box.
Each of these three options requires you to make some kind of choice about
how color is managed. You make choices (as we discuss later in this chap-
ter, when we walk you through the steps for printing) about whether to
color-manage your output. These selections are all unique to the Print
dialog box for your individual printer.

Printing with Color Profiles
573
Converting color to a printer profile
The third option in the preceding section mentions printing a file with con-
verted color when a profile is embedded in an image. If you choose one of
the first two options for converting color (either you select a profile or you
let the printer select one), the image on your monitor doesn’t change. The
conversion happens at print time.
You can physically convert the color in your image to a given printer profile,
and as you do so, you actually see how the color is converted before you
print your file. In a way, you’re proofing color before wasting paper and ink.
If you want to print files with accurate color, we recommend using this
method.
In Windows, you can download a free utility from Dry Creek Photo
(www.drycreekphoto.com) that converts color from a workspace to a color
profile. Suppose that you want to print some pictures at a discount store,
such as Costco, and you want to be certain to use the correct profile for the
photo equipment that prints your pictures. You want to convert color from
your color workspace (in this case, sRGB will work best for you) to the pro-
file used for the photo printer and paper you want to order.
Follow these steps to prepare a file for a photo service, such as Costco, or
when printing to your own desktop printer that applies profiles for the
papers you use:
1. Make all the necessary edits you need to make in Elements and save
your files in TIFF format.
You must use TIFF format to use the converter we mention in Step 6.
2. Download color profiles from your provider’s Web site.
Almost all service centers post color profiles for their printing equip-
ment. You can visit the Costco Web site at www.costco.com and click
the Photo link on the home page to go to the Photo Center. You’re
prompted to set up an account, and then you see a page where profiles
are listed. Costco makes the profiles available for stores in its geo-
graphic regions, and usually you find profiles for printing on the store’s
equipment and profiles best suited for different papers. Note: If several
profiles are available for downloading, be certain to use the right profile
for the paper you want your pictures to be printed on.

If you use a photo lab that wants you to convert color and embed pro-
files, you can visit independent lab Web sites and download profiles, 
as well.
If you want to convert color to your own printer, use a color profile
installed for your printer.
3. Copy the profiles to your system color folder:
C:\WINDOWS\system32\
spool\drivers\color.
This folder is where all your color profiles are stored. Note that the 
path is the same for Windows XP and Windows Vista.
If you’re converting color for your own printer, this folder contains 
all the color profiles installed by your printer software when you
installed the printer driver.
4. Download a converter by going to www.drycreekphoto.com/tools/
profile_converter and clicking the ProfileConverterSetup.zip link.
You need a utility to convert files that use the Adobe RGB (1998) or
sRGB color space to the color space used by machines at your service
center. Fortunately, the Dry Creek Photo converter is a great free tool.
The Dry Creek Photo Web site is one of the best sources of information
available for color management and color profiling. In addition to offer-
ing custom color-profiling services, Dry Creek Photo hosts a number of
different color profiles for many different commercial printers.
5. After downloading the file to your hard drive, double-click the Setup
file and follow the brief steps in the install wizard.
6. Choose Start➪Programs➪Dry Creek Photo➪Profile Converter➪ICC
Profile Converter.
The simple program interface opens, as you see in Figure 2-9.
7. Click the Source Image ellipsis ( . . . ) and select the source file.
The source file is the file saved in TIFF format that you want to print.
8. Click the Source Color Profile ellipsis and select the source color 
profile.
This color profile is currently embedded in your source file.

Figure 2-9: Select the options for converting the color profile 
and then select the Embed Profile in Image check box before 
clicking the Convert button.
9. Click the Destination Image ellipsis and select the folder where you
want to save your file.
10. Click the Destination Color Profile ellipsis and select the color profile
used by the equipment where you are placing your order.
You saved your color profiles to the Windows color folder, so be certain
to look in this folder for the target printer color profiles.
11. If you want to process multiple files, select the Process Multiple Files
check box.
12. Be certain to select the Embed Profile in Image check box and then
click the Convert button.
After you click Convert, the profile converter handles the profile conver-
sion and saves your files to the target folder.
Printing to Inkjet Printers
Printers are installed on your computer with printer drivers that are
designed to offer you settings and controls for options unique to your
printer. We can’t hope to cover all printers and the variations you find with
each device. 
What we can do is give you some general idea for printing by showing how
it’s done with Epson printers — one of the more-popular desktop printer
models out there. This gives you a basis for understanding some of the set-
tings you need to adjust when printing color to desktop printers and submit-
ting photos to some service providers.

If you own a different brand of printer or use a service that uses other print-
ers, what’s important to remember in reviewing this section is the process
involved in printing your files. Regardless of what type of printer you own,
be aware of when a color profile is used and how color is either managed or
not managed. You may have different check-box selections and menu com-
mands, but the process is the same for any printer printing your photos.
Over the past few years, at least half of the many service-provider trou-
bleshooting tech calls coming from clients involved problems with accurate
color output from Epson and some other ink jet printers. We’re not talking
about subtle changes between monitor and printer, but huge, monstrous
color changes on output prints. As it turns out, almost all the strange
output results originated from just one minor error that occurred when the
file was set up to print — it involved when and how to manage color in the
Print dialog box.
Color profiles are also dependent upon the ink being used. Refilling car-
tridges with generic ink can (in some cases) result in colors being shifted.
Similarly, if the nozzles aren’t clean and delivering ink consistently, you can
get some very strange results.
We’ve come up with settings that will work well for you to get accurate
results without stress or frustration. Just remember to use the settings
exactly as described, and you can achieve superior results with either desk-
top or professional printers.
When you install your printer driver, the installation utility also installs a
number of color profiles. You can choose the profiles in the Photoshop
Elements Print dialog box and control all the printing by using the profile
provided by your printer manufacturer.
You can also print from the Organizer by selecting one or more image
thumbnails in the Organizer window and then choosing File➪Print. We use
printing from Full Edit mode for the examples shown here because you may
often want to perform some final corrections before printing.
You have a choice for how these profiles are used. You can
 Choose to let your printer manage color. The profiling selection is
automatic, and you don’t have to worry about making other choices in
the Print dialog boxes.
 Choose to let Photoshop Elements manage color. In this case, you
need to make some choices about the color profile to be used and make
choices for the color-management process.

Printing to Inkjet Printers
577
We’re talking about two very different issues here. One issue is color 
management, which ultimately comes down to whether Elements manages
your color, your printer manages color, or whether you use no color 
management at all. The other issue is choosing a color profile. Therefore,
you have a series of combined options to choose from. You can choose a
profile and either turn color management on or off, or you can elect not 
to make a profile choice and decide whether color management is on 
or off. The choices you make are critical to getting color right on your
output.
All the methods are described in the following sections.
Automatic profile selection for Epson printers
The automatic profile selection method exists, and depending on what
model of printer you have, you may be required to make this choice.
Your options all depend on whether the printer you buy installs color pro-
files on your computer. If you buy some low-end color printers that cost less
than $100, the installer software typically doesn’t install color profiles.
When no profiles are installed, the printer manages the color through 
built-in profiles contained in the printer’s memory.
High-end models (above the $100 price range) often install individual color
profiles. You might see the profiles for various papers in the Printer Profile
pop-up menu in the Elements Print dialog box. If you have one of these high-
end printers, you might want to choose the profile that matches the paper
you’re using and let Elements manage the color.
As we discuss in Book III, Chapter 4, you have two choices for your color
workspace. Those choices are sRGB or Adobe RGB (1998). The workspace is
used to see color on your monitor. We also talk (in Book III, Chapter 4) about
calibrating your monitor so the colors you see appear as close to real-world
color as you can get.
When you print a picture, the color from your workspace (either sRGB or
Adobe RGB [1998]) is converted to your printer color. So, you want to take
all the color you see in an sRGB workspace, for example, and fit that color
into the printer’s profile so the print looks as close as possible to what you
see on your monitor. Elements takes care of this color conversion. The only
thing you need to worry about is making the right choice for how that con-
version takes place.

4. Set the print attributes.
Select the number of copies, position, scaling, and output items you want.
In the Color Management area of
the Print dialog box, as shown in
Figure 2-11, make your choices for
how to manage color when you 
print files.
5. From the Color Handling drop-
down menu, select Printer 
Manages Color.
This choice uses your current
workspace color and later con-
verts the color from your work-
space to the printer output file
when you open the printer driver
dialog box. 
6. Click Print in the Print 
dialog box.
The file doesn’t print yet. First, the
Windows system Print dialog box
opens, as shown in Figure 2-12.
7. Verify that your target printer is
still selected in the Windows
Print dialog box and then click
Preferences.
The printer driver dialog box opens.
Each printer displays a different dialog box after you click Properties in
the Windows Print dialog box. Figure 2-13 shows you the Epson Stylus
Photo R230 Series Properties dialog box. 
8. Set print attributes.
In our Epson example, select Epson Premium Glossy (or another paper
from the Type drop-down list that you may be using) and then click the
Best Photo radio button. (Refer to Figure 2-13.)
Now, it’s time to color-manage your file. This step is critical in your
print-production workflow.
9. Click the Advanced button and then, in the Warning dialog box that
appears, simply click Continue.
The Advanced Settings dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 2-14.

10. Make your choices in the Advanced Settings dialog box.
Here are the most important choices:
• Select a paper type. You selected paper already? The second drop-
down menu in the Paper & Quality section of the dialog box deter-
mines the application of inks. Choose the same paper here as you
did in Step 8.
• Turn on color management. Because you’re letting the printer driver
determine the color, you need to be certain that the Color Controls
radio button is active. This setting tells the printer driver to auto-
matically select a printer profile for the paper type you selected.
• Set the color mode. Don’t use Epson Vivid. This choice produces infe-
rior results on photos. Choose Best Photo, the Epson Standard, or
Adobe RGB, depending on your printer. 
If you frequently print files using the same settings, you can save your
settings by clicking the Save Setting button.
11. To print the photo, click OK, and then OK again in the Print dialog box.
Your file is sent to your printer. The color is converted automatically
from your source workspace of sRGB or Adobe RGB (1998) to the profile
the printer driver automatically selects for you.

Selecting a printer profile
Another method for managing color when you’re printing files is to select a
printer profile from the available list of color profiles installed with your
printer. Whereas in the preceding section, you used your printer to manage
color, this time, you let Photoshop Elements manage the color.
The steps in this section are the same as the ones described in the preced-
ing section for printing files for automatic profile selection when you’re set-
ting up the page and selecting a printer. When you choose File➪Print, you
open the Elements Print dialog box. To let Elements handle the color con-
version, follow these steps in the Print dialog box:
1. From the Printer Profile drop-down menu in the Color Management
section of the Print dialog box, select the color profile designed for
use with the paper you’ve chosen.
In this example, we use a heavyweight-matte-paper color profile, as
shown in Figure 2-15. (Note that custom color profiles you acquire from
a profiling service come with recommended color-rendering intents. For
this paper, Relative Colorimetric is recommended and is selected on the
Rendering Intent drop-down menu, as you can see in Figure 2-15.)
2. Click Print.
The second Print dialog box opens.
3. Click the Properties button.
You arrive at the same dialog box shown in Figure 2-13.
Figure 2-15: Choose a printer profile that matches the paper you use.

Printing to Inkjet Printers
583
4. Click the Best Photo radio button. From the Type drop-down list,
select the recommended paper choice.
Custom color profiles are also shipped with guidelines for selecting
proper paper.
5. Click Advanced and click Continue to arrive at the same dialog box
shown earlier in Figure 2-14.
The paper choice selection is automatically carried over from the previ-
ous Properties dialog box (see Step 2 in the preceding section). The one
setting you change is in the Color Management section.
6. Click the ICM (Image Color Management) radio button and check Off
(No Color Adjustment) as shown in Figure 2-16.
Because you selected the color profile in Step 1 and you’re letting
Elements manage the color, be sure the Color Management feature is
turned off. If you don’t turn off Color Management, you end up double-
profiling your print.
Figure 2-16: Click ICM and click Off (No Color Adjustment).

The choice to manage color or not to manage it is simplified in Photoshop
Elements. In the Color Management area of the dialog box, a message is
reported each time you make a selection from the Color Handling drop-
down menu. Right below Source Space, you see a message asking if you
remembered to turn Color Management on or off. Each time you make a
selection for the Color Handling, pause a moment and read the message.
This is your reminder that you need to follow the recommendation to prop-
erly handle color.
Printing with a custom profile
Printing with a custom profile is very simple. Just remember that you must
use the profile with exactly the same settings that you used to print the test
target when the profile was created. For custom profiles, you always use No
Color Management throughout the output process.
Let us make this concept even clearer. When you generate your test target
for the profiling service where you may order a custom profile created for
your printer, the service requires that you print the target without color
conversions of any kind. The target has to reflect the actual colors gener-
ated by your printer from a known sample file, with no modifications what-
soever, for a known printing condition and media type. The resulting profile
tells the color engine exactly how to modify the output data to match the
colors as closely as possible to your working space or a different previously
embedded color profile.
For all this to work properly, the printer can’t be allowed to modify the
printing data in any way. All the work has to be done by Photoshop
Elements. So, assuming that you have a custom profile ready to use, here’s
the setup:
1. Use a profile converter to convert color.
In Windows, use a utility, such as the Dry Creek Photo Profile Converter.
(For details, see “Converting color to a printer profile,” earlier in this
chapter.)
If you’ve obtained a custom profile from a media supplier, you must use
the specific media and intent settings it recommends for your printer,
although all other instructions in this section are the same.
2. Open the converted file in Elements and choose File➪Print.

Submitting Files to Service Centers
585
3. In the Print dialog box, select No
Color Management for your
printer profile, as shown in
Figure 2-17.
4. Click Print.
5. Turn off Color Management.
Use the same settings for printing
when you let Elements determine
color. Be certain to turn off color
management, the same way we
show you in the preceding section
(see Figure 2-15).
Submitting Files to Service Centers
On provider Web sites, you can usually find guidelines for acceptable file
formats and the recommended resolutions and dimensions of your images.
If you don’t see these guidelines on Web sites, be sure to call and inquire
about which file attributes are acceptable.
As a general rule, here are some things you should consider when you’re
submitting files, if guidelines aren’t provided:
 Color workspace: Always ask a provider what workspace it prefers to
use to convert color. Online services generally recommend that you use
sRGB as your color workspace.
 Resolution: For photo-printing machines, be certain to submit files at
300 ppi (pixels per inch). See Book III, Chapter 1 for more information
on image resolution.
 Dimensions: As a general rule, you should size images to the print size.
For example, if you want 4-x-6-inch prints, be certain that your images
are sized to 4 x 6 inches at 300 ppi.
 File format: Some centers may take only JPEG images. If TIFF isn’t
acceptable, locate the converted images you saved from the Dry Creek
ICC Profile Converter and follow these steps (in Windows):
1. Open the TIFF file or files in Photoshop Elements and choose
File➪Save As.
Book IX
Chapter 2
Getting It Printed
Figure 2-17: Select No Color
Management when you print files with

2. Be certain that the ICC Profile check box is selected in the Save
Options in the Save/Save As dialog box. Select JPEG for the
format and click Save.
Notice that the profile used
with the Dry Creek ICC Profile
Converter is listed as the ICC
Profile. In Figure 2-18, you can
see a profile embedded for a
Costco print center. (See the
section “Converting color to a
printer profile,” earlier in this
chapter, for more on the Dry Creek Converter.)
 Media storage: If you walk into a FedEx Kinko’s store and go to the self-
serve photo-printing machines, you don’t see support for any external
USB hard drives or removable USB drives. All the print centers support
a wide range of media cards used by digital cameras. Be certain to use
your memory cards and not USB devices when placing orders. If you
use CompactFlash II, memory sticks, or other media sources used by
digital cameras, copy your files to these sources when you place orders
as a walk-in customer.
Vendors that host Web sites with downloadable profiles and order informa-
tion are likely to accept file uploads online. This capability saves you the
time spent fighting crowds when you’re placing orders. In some cases, you
can have service centers mail your images back to you so that you don’t
need to wait when you’re picking up orders, either. This online ordering
stuff is a matter that we talk about in the following section.
Using Online Printing Services
Photoshop Elements supports the Adobe Photoshop Services program,
which is a joint effort between Adobe Systems and Kodak EasyShare (for-
merly Ofoto), a division of Kodak. The Services program offers online order-
ing of prints and sharing of photos and projects, and it has a huge array of
different print products for consumers and professionals.
As of this writing, you get ten free prints, so it’s worth taking a little time to
check out the service — especially if you want to order prints and have
them mailed directly to your home or office. No lines, no hassles, no dealing
with high gasoline costs — this service offers great prints and an abun-
dance of convenience.
Figure 2-18: You can change file formats
from TIFF to JPEG andpreserve embedded
profiles when you’re saving from Elements.

Using Online Printing Services
587
To use the service, follow these steps:
1. Select files in the Organizer much as you’d select files for printing.
2. In either editing mode or the Organizer, choose File➪Order Prints.
Alternatively, you can click the Share tab in the Panel Bin and click
the Order Prints button.
The Kodak EasyShare wizard opens, as shown in Figure 2-19. The first
screen shown in the wizard is a form for you to create an account.
If you try to place an order from your office where the IT department
prevents you from connecting to some external sources, you may need
to have your firewall settings adjusted. Talk to someone in your IT
department to help you make a connection.
Figure 2-19: Choose File➪Order Prints to open the Kodak EasyShare wizard.
3. If you haven’t set up an account already, fill in the information and
step through the wizard by clicking the Next button on each page. If
you have set up an account, supply your logon information.
The selected files in the Organizer are automatically loaded in Step 1 of
the wizard’s order page.

588
4. You can modify your order by deleting files from the order and speci-
fying different print sizes and quantities.
One nice feature in the service is the option to send duplicate prints to
another party. You can keep an address book on the provider’s Web site
and specify whom you want to receive an order. This feature is helpful if
you’re away spending your children’s inheritance on a Caribbean cruise
and want to send photos of the great time you’re having to all your kids.
Just pop open your laptop on the pool deck, load the digital camera
images, and connect via a wireless connection. Before you return to
Buffalo in midwinter with a suntan, your kids will frown as they fan
through the prints they received a week earlier.
5. Continue stepping through the wizard to upload your files and con-
firm your order, click the Finish button on the last pane, and your
order is complete.
Exploring Other Print Options
Photoshop Elements provides you with other options for printing things,
such as video images and contact sheets; adding borders and trim lines;
and inverting images for heat transfers, such as the ones you may use for
iron-on T-shirt designs. You can find these options in the Print dialog box.
Most of these print options are intuitive and easy to use. Just poke around,
experiment, and have fun. When it comes time to print, follow the recom-
mendations we offer here for getting your color right.

W
hen we talk about optimizing images for Web viewing, we’re also talk-
ing about viewing files on computer monitors, TVs, iPods, and other
screen devices. After all, viewing Web pages at this time in technology his-
tory requires viewing Web pages on a screen of some kind. This chapter
presents concepts related to preparing and viewing files on the Web, as well
as sharing files for viewing on screen devices. 
There are a few variances between Web-viewing photos and screen-viewing
photos. It is important to use a color palette that can display the same colors
on Web-page images whatever the viewer’s computer operating system.
In this chapter, we talk about preparing images for Web-hosting
and screen viewing, working with color palettes optimized for
Web-hosted images, preparing type for Web and screen
viewing, and creating Web galleries to upload your files
to a Web service.
Understanding Basic Web
Optimization
If you’ve read through chapters in any of the previ-
ous Books, you are aware of some of the differences
between files you prepare for print and those that are
used for Web pages. 
To optimize images for Web viewing, you want to reduce the
file size for every image uploaded to a URL. If you download files 
from your camera or card reader (as we explain in Book II, Chapter 1) 

Understanding Basic Web Optimization
590
or prepare files for print (as we explain in Book IX, Chapter 2), you must
often reduce the file sizes for Web-hosted images in order to ensure faster
downloads.
Anyone viewing a Web page is likely to get impatient if file sizes are large
and the download times are extraordinary. Getting files to the smallest file
size without compromising image quality is the goal of every Web designer.
Choosing a resolution
Your first effort at optimizing files for Web hosting involves obtaining the
best resolutions for Web-hosted files.
On the Macintosh, Web-hosted files are optimum at 72 ppi (pixels per inch);
on Windows resolutions of 72 and 96 ppi are optimum for Web hosting.
Before moving on to other optimizing tasks, it’s best to downsample images
to either 72 or 96 ppi. As a standard, you can set the resolution to 72 ppi,
confident that all Web browsers will display the images at the same size.
To downsample an image, do the following:
1. Open an image in Full Edit mode.
2. Choose Image➪Resize➪Image Size or press Alt/Option+Ctrl/Ô+I.
The Image Size dialog box opens,
as shown in Figure 3-1.
3. Set the dimensions.
Type the new dimensions in either
the Width or Height text box for
the document size. By default, the
proportions are constrained so
when you type a value in either
text box, the other size is automat-

4. Check the Resample Image 
check box and choose a 
resampling method from the
drop-down menu. 
Figure 3-1: The Image Size dialog box.

Understanding Basic Web Optimization
591
By default, the resampling method used is Bicubic, which provides the
best results for continuous-tone images such as photos. You have other
options in the drop-down list that work better with illustrated art, line
art, and other types of images. For more information on the methods of
downsampling, see Book III, Chapter 1.
5. Enter the desired resolution in the Resolution field.
6. Click OK.
The file is downsampled according to the settings made in the Image
Size dialog box.
Upsampling images
As a general rule, avoid upsampling images — sizing an image up with the
Resample Image check box enabled in the Image Size dialog box. We cover
some of the pitfalls for upsampling images in Book III, Chapter 1. We also
point you to a third-party plug-in that can be useful if you absolutely have to
size up images.
Rasterizing files
Rasterizing files is the process of converting vector artwork to raster art-
work. Artwork created in programs like Adobe Illustrator and CorelDraw are
typically vector art files. Vector objects in Elements can be type as well as
some shapes that are created on vector layers.
When you flatten layers in Elements you rasterize the vector layers. When you
open vector art such as Adobe Illustrator files, CorelDraw files, or PDF files,
you rasterize the artwork. To learn more about raster versus vector art, see
Book III, Chapter 1. To learn more about type on layers, see Book V, Chapter 3.
Rasterizing vector artwork on layers in Elements converts the artwork to
pixels at the resolution of the open file where the vector artwork is added.
When you open a file containing vector art, you can choose to rasterize the
artwork at a user-defined resolution.
Choosing File➪Open
When you open artwork containing vector art, you see a dialog box where
you control the options for rasterizing the file. In Figure 3-2, we opened a PDF
document. The Import PDF dialog provides us some controls for determining
the size and resolution.
Book IX

the Web

Figure 3-2: The Import PDF dialog box.
Unlike raster art, upsizing a vector art file does not degrade the image.
Because the artwork is not yet pixels, you can rasterize a vector file to any
size you like. When preparing these images, you want both the physical
dimensions and the resolution to be the best for your Web pages.
Selecting a color mode
In Book III, Chapter 2, we cover all the color modes supported by Elements.
When you create images for Web pages, all the color modes available in
Elements are acceptable for Web graphics. Your choices for color modes
include
 Bitmap: The bitmap color mode is generally used for line art. Images
such as black-and-white logos might be scanned as line art and, there-
fore, be rendered as bitmap images. After you have a bitmap image in
Elements, you can save the files as GIF or PNG, but you don’t have an
option for using the Save for Web command. It’s generally best to con-
vert bitmap images to grayscale first, and then save the files for the Web.
 Grayscale: Grayscale images can be saved for Web hosting.
 Indexed Color: Indexed color images provide you some options for
reducing the number of colors in a file to get smaller file sizes.
Continuous-tone images, such as photographs, generally won’t look as
good onscreen unless they are saved as RGB color images. However,
artwork such as color logos can be reduced in file size by limiting the
number of colors to fewer than 256 without degrading image quality. 
 RGB color: RGB is best used with continuous-tone images. 

Understanding Basic Web Optimization
593
Understanding file formats
Elements has a number of different file formats for saving files. However,
only a few of the long list of supported file formats work with Web graphics.
We cover all the formats in Book III, Chapter 2. For a little review, here are
the formats you can use when preparing files for Web hosting:
GIF
GIF is one of the popular file formats you find on many Web sites. GIF files
are saved as indexed color where the total number of colors in an image can
be reduced to fewer than 256 in order to get smaller file sizes. You can also
use the GIF format when saving images that display animated effects.
When you choose File➪Save As in Full
Edit mode and choose Compuserve GIF
(*.GIF), the Indexed Color dialog box
opens, as shown in Figure 3-3. In this
dialog box you make choices for
 Palette: Open the Palette drop-
down list and you can choose from
a number of different color-palette
options. Among your choices is the
Web palette. Making this choice
reduces the total colors from the
default 256 to 217. The 217 colors
are known as Web Safe colors,
meaning that these colors look the
same on both the Macintosh and
Windows operating systems.
 Colors: You can reduce colors lower than the default 256 by typing a
number in the Colors text box. The more colors you eliminate the lower
the file size. However, if you reduce colors in continuous-tone images,
you notice severe contrast between tones. This contrast is likely to pro-
duce degraded images. Furthermore, reducing colors in artwork too far
may produce other unwanted results. You need to experiment a little
when reducing colors by checking the Preview check box and viewing
the image before actually saving. What you see on your screen is what
you get. If the Preview looks good, go ahead and click the OK button.
 Forced: This option is available with bitmap images. You can save as
Black and White and when the Transparency check box is enabled, the
whites appear as transparent.
 Matte: When you have transparency in an image, you can use a matte
color for the transparent areas. Your choices include a list of preset colors
as well as a Custom option for you to set the color to a custom color
within the palette you choose.
Book IX
Chapter 3
Getting It on 
the Web
Figure 3-3: The Indexed Color dialog
box opens when you save files as
Compuserve GIF.

Understanding Basic Web Optimization
594
 Dither: When indexed files are saved and the colors contain up to a
maximum of 256 colors, you need a way to simulate color transitions.
This is handled through a dithering process whereby the color transi-
tions simulate a view that appears to have more than 256 colors. Your
dither choices include Diffusion, Pattern, and Noise. For continuous
tone images, the Diffusion dither produces the least-obvious color 
transitions.
 Preserve Exact Colors: Check this box to preserve colors that have
exact matches to the color palette you choose.
JPEG
JPEG is also one of the most popular
file formats you find on Web pages.
JPEG images can be saved as progres-
sive JPEGs to permit the image file to
be downloaded progressively (in
stages, in other words), This format
supports some great file compression.
When you save as JPEG, the JPEG
Options dialog box opens as shown in
Figure 3-4. Your options in this dialog
box include
 Matte: This option is the same as
when saving as GIF.
 Quality: Type a value between 1
and 12 for the amount of compression you want to apply to the saved
file. JPEG is a lossy file format, meaning that data are thrown away
during compression. The lower the number, the more data are thrown
away. If you reduce the value too low, you see obvious image degrada-
tion. Keep the Preview check box checked, and you can dynamically see
the results your tweaking has on the image before clicking OK.
The drop-down menu adjacent to the Quality value offers you five set-
tings. When making a menu choice, the Quality value changes respec-
tive to the menu choice. Additionally, you can move the slider to
change the value in the Quality text box.
When previewing different compression options, be sure to zoom in on
your photos. If the photo is fit in the Image window, you may not see
the results of the compression selections you make when the Preview
check box is checked. If you start with the image fit within the Image
window, you can keep the JPEG Options dialog box open and press
Ctrl/@Ô+ to zoom in. You can place the cursor in the Image window,
and you see the Hand tool. Click and drag the photo around to view
areas respective to the Quality setting you choose in the JPEG Options
dialog box.
Figure 3-4: The JPEG Options dialog box.

Understanding Basic Web Optimization
595
 Format Options: You have three choices. The first two use line-by-line
passing and an optimized encoding system to display images. The
Progressive option displays images using several passes. You specify
the number of passes in the Scans drop-down menu, where you can
choose from 3 and 5.
JPEG 2000
This format is a newer JPEG format that provides you with options for,
among other things, saving files compressed without data loss. Choose
File➪Save As and choose the JPEG 2000 (*.JPF, *.JPX, *.JP2, *.J2C, *.J2K,
*.JPG) format from the Format drop-down menu in the Save As dialog box.
When you make the choice, the JPEG 2000 dialog box opens as shown in
Figure 3-5. Your options in this dialog box include
Figure 3-5: The JPEG 2000 dialog box.
 File Size: Type in a value for the file size you want and Elements adjusts
compression to make the file fit within the specified size.
 Lossless: Check this box for lossless compression, meaning no data are
tossed away when the file is saved. 
 Fast Mode: Check this box for quick file encoding.
 Quality: Type a value or adjust the drop-down slider for a quality setting.
 Include Metadata: Check this box to make metadata accessible. For
more information on metadata, see Book II, Chapter 2.
 Include Transparency: Check this box to preserve transparency when
transparency is included in the file.
Book IX
Chapter 3
Getting It on 
the Web

Understanding Basic Web Optimization
596
 JP2 Compatible: This check box is enabled by default to make the file
compatible with the JP2 format.
 Optimization Order: When it comes to the order in which images are
optimized, you have the following three choices:
• Growing Thumbnail: This option saves the file with an animated
effect to display a thumbnail of the image with successive zoom
views until the full view is loaded.
• Progressive: This option saves the file with a progressive loading of
the file from low to high resolution.
• Color: Use this option to load the image in entirety without 
progression.
 Download Rate: Choose a bandwidth minimum from the Download
Rate. If you expect people to use cell phones to download Web pages,
use the default 14.4 Kbps option. For higher-speed connections, make a
choice from the other options in the drop-down menu.
 Preview: Click the Preview button to preview the file as it will be loaded
on a Web page.
If you use JPEG2000 format for Web images, most Web browsers require a
special plug-in to view the images.
PNG
PNG supports two different formats — PNG-8 and PNG-24. You can save files
as PNG-8 using the Save As dialog box. However, using the Save As command
doesn’t provide you all the options that can be set for PNG files. (In fact, all
you get from the Save As dialog box are the rather paltry options shown in
Figure 3-6.) If you want to use the PNG-24 format or take advantage of more
options choices for PNG-8, you must use the Save for Web dialog box. See
“Optimizing Images with Save for Web” later in this chapter.
Figure 3-6: The PNG Options dialog box
when using Save As and choosing the PNG 
format.

Using a Web-Save Palette and Hexadecimal Colors
597
Using a Web-Safe Palette and Hexadecimal Colors
When working with indexed color files, you have a maximum of 256 colors
available in the Indexed Color palette. Compare that value with the 16.7 mil-
lion colors that you have available with RGB color.
When you convert an RGB image to indexed color, the colors outside the
Indexed Color spectrum are dithered to simulate colors that more closely
resemble an image in RGB mode.
Out of the 256 colors that you find in the Indexed Color palette, 39 colors do
not look the same in different operating systems. The color display is deter-
mined by the OS for the Macintosh and Windows computers, and it turns
out that these operating systems produce 39 different color values that
cannot be viewed identically across platforms. Therefore, we have 217 out
of 256 colors that are viewed identically by both operating systems.
Specifying a foreground Web Safe color
The 217 colors are referred to as being within a Web Safe color palette, and
Elements makes it easy for you to work with the palette when converting
color images, creating type, and creating graphic elements such as buttons
and icons.
To specify a color within the Web Safe color palette, do the following:
1. Open Full Edit mode.
2. Click the Foreground color swatch in the Tools panel.
The Select Foreground Color dialog box opens.
3. Click Only Web Colors.
Only the colors within a Web Safe color palette are displayed in the
dialog box.
4. Click in the large color swatch to make a color selection.
You can scroll the hues by moving the slider to the right of the large
color swatch. When you enter the hue range of a color you want, click in
the swatch as shown in Figure 3-7.
The color choice you make in the Select Foreground dialog box reports
the hexadecimal value of the color. In Figure 3-7, the value is 993333. You
can use this value in HTML code when creating Web pages to specify
background color and color for other Web page elements.
Book IX
Chapter 3

598
Figure 3-7: Check Only Web Colors to display the Web Safe color palette.
5. Click OK.
The Web Safe color you selected is loaded in the Foreground color
swatch in the Tools panel. When you fill selections and use the painting
and marking tools, the color you apply is a Web Safe color. For more
information on filling selections and painting, see Book IV, Chapter 1.
Using a Web Safe palette
If you create various elements and objects that you want to include in a Web
page design, you want to open a palette and work with Web Safe colors. To
do so, follow these steps:
1. Open Full Edit mode.
2. Open the Color Swatches palette.
Choose Window➪Color Swatches.
3. Load a Web Safe palette.
Open the drop-down menu in the Color Swatches palette and choose
from Web Hues, Web Safe Colors, or Web Spectrum as shown in Figure
3-8. The colors you work with from any of these color swatch libraries
are within the Web Safe color spectrum.

Figure 3-8: Choose a Web Safe color palette from the drop-down list.
Making Type Look Good Onscreen
Adding type to images or creating type on a blank, new file (for example, one
that creates a banner on a Web page) is something that you do frequently in
Elements if you’re a Web page designer.
You need to take few precautions when creating type for the Web. These
include
 Setting the file size and resolution before creating the type.
Don’t rely on resampling images when you have type as either a stand-
alone element or an addition to photos and layouts.
 Using Web Safe colors.
Set the foreground color from the Web Safe color palette, or choose a
color from the Color Swatches library of Web Safe colors.
 Being certain to use anti-aliased type.
When you create type, be certain the Anti-Aliased icon is enabled in the
shortcuts bar, as shown in Figure 3-9.
Book IX

Figure 3-9: When creating type, click the Anti-Aliased tool in 
the Options Bar.
When you anti-alias type, Elements creates some pixels of different color
values at the edges of your type to simulate a smoother type appearance. If
you don’t anti-alias the type, the edges appear jagged. In Figure 3-10, you
see type created on the left without anti-aliasing. On the right, you see the 
same type created with anti-aliasing.
We cover a lot more related to working with type in Book V, Chapter 3. Look
over that chapter to learn much more about specifying type.

Optimizing Images with Save for Web
601
Optimizing Images with Save for Web
The save options you have available in the Save As dialog box enable you to
save files in formats that are compatible with Web-hosted images. However,
the options you have in the Safe As dialog box are much more limited than
the ones available to you in the Save for Web dialog box.
In the Save for Web dialog box, you can optimize images and create pre-
views to simulate download times. Even if you don’t tweak the sampling
and/or resolution of your files, you can rely on the Save for Web dialog box
to offer you many other optimization features.
Choose File➪Save for Web to open the Save for Web dialog box shown in
Figure 3-11. In this dialog box, you can choose any of the compatible file for-
mats that support Web-hosting images. Additionally, you can adjust settings
and optimize your files to create the smallest file sizes.

The option choices you have in the Save for Web dialog box are covered in
Book III, Chapter 2. Look over that chapter to explore all the possible options.

Creating an Online Gallery
602
Creating an Online Gallery
Conceptually, creating an online “gallery” in Elements 7 has changed. In
Elements 6, you used the Organizer to select your desired images or an
existing album, and then chose a gallery template from a list of options. You
then uploaded the online gallery via FTP protocol. Now, with Elements 7, an
online gallery means that you are sharing your albums on a publicly visible
page for all the world to see. And it is accomplished using Photoshop.com.
For more on Photoshop.com, see Book I, Chapter 1.
Follow these steps to create an online gallery on Photoshop.com:
1. Go to www.photoshop.com and log in using your account user name
and password.
If you do not have a user name and password yet, read up in Book I,
Chapter 1 for how to sign up for them
2. Go to the My Photos section.
Click My Photos at the top of the Photoshop.com window in the
Navigation bar.
3. If you have existing albums uploaded to Photoshop.com, click the
down-pointing arrow to the left of the album name(s) and click the
Available to All button. This enables your album to be added to your
online gallery.
If you don’t have any existing albums, get one started by first clicking
the Upload Photos command in the top-left corner of the
Photoshop.com window. After your photos have been uploaded, select
them and click the Create album command at the bottom of the
window.
4. Click the My Gallery Albums link in the left pane to go to the My
Gallery section, as shown in Figure 3-12.
5. If you so desire, add a tagline and description for your gallery. 
To add text, simply click within the text field and type.
6. If you want to add a photo for your profile, return to the My Photos
section. Select a photo and mouse over the photo to reveal the Photo
Options menu. Click and choose Use as Profile Image from the menu.
7. If you would like to have an overall background image for your
gallery, repeat Step 6, but choose Use as Gallery Background from
the menu.
Your online gallery is now available for all to browse on Photoshop.com.

In This Chapter
 Creating online albums
 Attaching files to e-mail
 Using Photo Mail
 Creating CDs and DVDs
 Working with slides and slideshows
 Using online sharing services
 Using CEIVA Digital Photo Frames
You shoot photos primarily for two reasons (if you’re not selling them
for income). One reason is for personal satisfaction so you can revel in
your own work. The other reason involves sharing your creations with
others.
Perhaps the most enjoyable aspect of photography is experiencing the
appreciation of family and friends who laugh, cry, oooh, and
aaah when looking at your images.
Photoshop Elements provides you with a number of dif-
ferent sharing options to get those laughs, cries,
ooohs, and aaahs from others. When it comes down
to it, the sharing of photos just might be one of the
best reasons you have for using Photoshop
Elements.
In this chapter we look at the number of different
opportunities Elements provides to enable you 
to share photos in your living room or across the
world.

Creating an Online Album
606
Creating an Online Album
The first of the sharing options we cover in this chapter involves creating
an online album. Elements offers a few options for sharing photo albums
online. The name of this option is a bit misleading because you don’t neces-
sarily have to host your album online in order to share it. In fact, you have
three separate options for sharing photo albums, including
 Photoshop.com. When you create a photo album you can choose
Photoshop.com as your target source for saving your file. In order 
to use Photoshop.com, you need to have an account as we discuss 
in Book I, Chapter 1.
 Export to CD/DVD. This option gives you the opportunity to save your
creation to a CD or DVD. 
 Export to FTP. You can host an album on Photoshop.com as a Web
page. All the HTML code is included in your upload so you don’t need
to worry about how images are viewed or how to create URL links. Note
that this sharing option no longer lets you host pages on a Web server
space from your local ISP. To upload files to your own Web site you
need to use an FTP client and upload files much like you upload your
own Web pages.
Elements makes it easy for you to create an online album. To verify our
claim, follow these steps:
1. Open the Organizer and select the photos you want to use in a new
album.
2. Click Share in the Panel Bin and choose Online Album from the
panel options, as shown in Figure 4-1.
Figure 4-1: Select photos in the Organizer and open the Share panel 
and click Online Album.

3. In the Album Details panel 
that appears, type a name 
for your album as shown in
Figure 4-2.
4. Adjust the order of the photos.
If you find that you don’t want
some of the photos shown in the
Album Details panel, click the
unwanted photos and then click
the minus (-) icon. If you want to
add additional photos, drag them
from the Organizer to the Album
Details panel or click a photo in
the Organizer and then click the
Add (+) icon.
The order shown in the panel is
the same order the photos will
appear in your album. If you want
to rearrange the photos, click and
drag them around the Album
Details panel. The panel behaves
much like a slide sorter.
5. Click Share.
The next pane opens in the 
Album Details panel, as shown 
in Figure 4-3.
6. Change the template.
Click Change Template to expand
the Album Details panel to display

Creating a CD/DVD
You can output creations, such as slide shows and images you optimize for
TV, to a CD or DVD by using the Slide Show Output wizard. If you have a
movie but don’t have a DVD burner, most DVD players sold today enable
you to view videodiscs written to CDs. The CDs just don’t hold as much con-
tent as DVDs do.
VCDs display at lower resolutions than DVDs (VCD is an 1150kbps video
stream with a 352x240 resolution for NTSC, and DVD is 720x480 at variable
bit-rates between about 3000 and 9800kbps and mp2 or AC3 Dolby audio).
You can get 80 minutes of VCD on a 700MB CD (74 min on a 650MB).
To write to a CD or DVD, follow these steps:
1. Open a project in the Slide Show Output wizard by double-clicking a
project in the Organizer.
For more information on creating projects, see the section “Creating
Slides and Slideshows” later in this chapter and also look over Book IX,
Chapter 1.
2. Click Output in the Slide Show Editor.
The first screen of the Slide Show Output wizard appears.

3. Click Burn to Disc and then click OK.
If you want to burn additional slide shows to the same disc, check the
box where you see Include Additional Slide Shows I’ve Made On This
Disc. Otherwise, just click OK to burn a single slide show to a disc.
4. In the next screen of the wizard,
choose a file format.
Click either NTSC or PAL for the
video format you use. NTSC is com-
monly used in the U.S. and Japan,
whereas PAL is commonly used in
Europe and other countries. Be cer-
tain to check the format used by
your video player and TV before
making a choice here.
5. Click OK.
The Burn dialog box opens, and
your CD drive door on your com-
puter opens.
6. Insert a CD and click OK.
The Status bar shows the 
writing progress, as shown in
Figure 4-19.
After the CD or DVD finishes writing,
pop open your CD/DVD drive and remove the disc. Place the disc in your
DVD player and press Play. The movie automatically starts playing, like any
commercial videodisc.
Creating Slides and Slideshows
The Photoshop Elements Slide Show Editor is a powerful tool that enables
you to create PDF slideshows and movie files. It’s so easy that you can soon
become a motion picture director, star, and editor all rolled into one.
The first step is to create a project. After a project is created, you can save
it and continue editing at a later time, export the project as a PDF slideshow,
or create a movie file.
Creating a project
You create a project file in the Slide Show Editor and can then export it for a
number of different uses. In this section, you can find out how to create and
save your project. In the following section, you dive into exporting.
Figure 4-19: This VCD is almost done.

Creating Slides and Slideshows
619
Here’s how to create a slideshow project that you can edit and export later:
1. Open the Organizer and select the pictures you want to use in your
slide show.
2. Click the Create button in the Panel Bin and then click Slide Show.
The Slide Show Preferences dialog box opens. To be honest, just about
everything in the dialog box can be adjusted in the Slide Show Editor
itself, so don’t worry about making choices here. If you want to keep the
Slide Show Preferences dialog box from reappearing when you make
slide creations, deselect the Show This Dialog Each Time a New Slide
Show Is Created check box.
3. Click OK in the Slide Show Preferences dialog box.
The Slide Show Editor opens, as shown in Figure 4-20.
4. If your Slide Show Editor doesn’t show you a screen similar to the one
shown in Figure 4-20, maximize the window by clicking the Maximize
button in the upper-right corner of the Editor window.
This way, you can see the Storyboard at the bottom of the screen and
the Panel Bin on the right side of the editor.
Figure 4-20: The Slide Show Editor is where you create slideshows.

5. (Optional) Create a Pan & Zoom view.
When slides are shown, you have the option of zooming and panning a
slide. Click the Enable Pan & Zoom check box and click the Start thumb-
nail. A rectangle appears in the preview area. Move any one of the four
corner handles in or out to resize the rectangle. Moving the cursor
inside the rectangle and clicking the mouse button enables you to move
the rectangle around the preview.
For the end zoom position, click the End thumbnail and size the rectan-
gle to a zoomed view or a view that you want to stop the zoom. Notice
in Figure 4-20 that the End thumbnail is selected, and the rectangle is
sized down to the zoom area on a portion of the photo.
6. (Optional) Add a graphic.
A library of graphics appears in the Extras pane in the Panel Bin. Drag a
graphic to a slide. If you want to show a blank slide first and then add
text and graphics to it, click Add Blank Slide on the Shortcuts bar at the
top of the Editor.
7. (Optional) Add text.
Click the Text tool in the Extras pane in the Panel Bin and drag a text
style to the blank slide or the opening slide in the slideshow. After you
drag text to a slide, the Properties pane opens in the Panel Bin. The text
you drag to the slide is placeholder text. To edit the text, click Edit Text
in the Properties pane. You can also select a font, a font point size, a
color for the text, text alignment, and a font style. After setting the type
attributes, click inside the text and move it to the position you want.
8. (Optional) Set transitions.
The icons between the slides in the Storyboard (at the bottom of the
Slide Show Editor) indicate a default transition applied to the slideshow.
You can change transition effects for each slide independently or for all
the slides in the show. Click the right-pointing arrow on the right side of
a transition icon to open a pop-up menu containing a number of different
transitions, as shown in Figure 4-21. If you want to apply the same transi-
tion to all slides, choose Apply to All from the menu commands.
Be conservative with the transition effects. Too many transitions of dif-
ferent types can make the slideshow appear amateurish and distracting
to the viewers.
9. (Optional) Add audio and media.
You can add audio to the slideshow by choosing Add Media➪Audio
from Organizer (or from Folder) from the Shortcuts bar at the top of the
Editor. Select an audio file and click OK.
You can also add movie files to your slideshow. A movie file can be
added on top of a slide or on a new slide. When the slideshow is played,
the video file plays. Choose Add Media➪Photos and Videos from
Organizer (or from Folder).

Creating Slides and Slideshows
621
This same set of commands can also
be used to add more pictures to the
slide show.
10. (Optional) Record your own sounds.
If you want to add narration, click
the Narration tool (represented by a
Microphone icon to the right of the
Text tool) in the Panel Bin. The
Extras panel changes to provide you
with tools to record a sound or
import a sound file. Note that this
option requires you to have a micro-
phone properly configured on your
computer.
11. (Optional) Fit slides to the audio.
If you have 3 minutes of audio and
the slide duration is 2 minutes 
30 seconds, you can, with a single
mouse click, uniformly change the
slide duration to fit the 3-minute
audio time. Just click the Fit Slides 
to Audio button below the preview
image.
If you want to manually adjust time
for slide durations, click the down
arrow on the time readout below the
slide thumbnails in the Storyboard.
12. Click Save Project on the Shortcuts
bar and then, in the dialog box that
opens, type a name and click Save.
Your project is added to the
Organizer and is available for fur-
ther editing later. Or, you can open
the project to save in a number of
different output formats, as we
explain in the following section.
13. Preview the slide show.
Before exporting the slide show, you
can see a preview by clicking the
buttons directly below the image
preview area. If you want a full-
screen preview, click the Full Screen
Preview button on the Shortcuts bar
and click the Play button.

Exporting to slides and video
After creating a project, you have a number of different output options. You
can write a project to disc for archival purposes and include slide shows on
a VideoCD (videodisc) or DVD as we explain earlier in this chapter in the
section “Creating a CD/DVD.” You can e-mail a slide show to another user,
share a project online, write a project compatible for display on a TV, or
save to either a PDF slide show or Windows movie file.
To write a PDF slide show or a movie file, follow these steps:
1. In the Organizer window, double-click the project thumbnail.
The project opens in the Adobe Photoshop Elements Slide Show Editor.
2. Click the Output button on the Shortcuts bar.
The Output Your Slide Show wizard opens, as shown in Figure 4-22.
Figure 4-22: Select Output in the Photoshop Elements Slide Show Editor 
to open the Slide Show Output wizard.
3. Select the type of file you want to export to.
Select Movie File (.wmv) to export a Windows media video file. Your
exported video can be viewed in Elements or in the Windows Media
Player. You can import the video in all programs that support .wmv files.
Select PDF File (.pdf) if you want to create a PDF slide show. If you
create a PDF slide show, some of the animation features, such as zoom-
ing slides and transition effects, aren’t shown in the PDF document.
4. In the dialog box that opens, which prompts you to add your output
file to the Organizer, click Yes.
You can now easily view the file by double-clicking it in the Organizer
window.

Sharing Photos Online
623
Sharing Photos Online
Several methods of sharing your creations are available in Elements. You
can use the new Adobe-hosted Photoshop.com service, place print orders
with third-party online services, or e-mail photo files to friends.
Using Kodak EasyShare
We talked about using Kodak EasyShare in Book IX, Chapter 1. To learn how
to share your photos using this service, refer to that chapter.
Using Photoshop.com
Adobe has now made it super-convenient and easy for you to share your
favorite images online with the new Photoshop.com service. Although it’s
available only in the United States right now, Adobe plans on eventually
extending the service to other countries. In addition to photo sharing,
Photoshop.com offers automated backup and synchronization of your files,
which enables you to manage your photos and other media assets online
from any Web browser.
Creating a Photoshop.com account
If you’re a U.S. resident, you can sign up for a free account, and share photos
and videos via your own personal Web page. You can set up an account from
the Elements Welcome screen or from the Editor or Organizer.
Follow these steps to set up a Photoshop.com account:
1. At the Elements Welcome screen, click the Join Now button on the
Photoshop.com Membership panel, which appears on the left of the
window.
If you blew by the Welcome screen, you can also click the Join Now
button in the top-right of either the Editor or Organizer window (Mac
users need to use Adobe Bridge).
2. Fill out the usual form fields — name, e-mail address, and password.
Then enter your personal URL.
This URL is your personal Web address for displaying and sharing your
photos and videos online.
3. Click Create Account.
4. Choose a free Basic account, which gives you up to 5MB in storage, or
a Plus account, which gives you additional storage options and other
added features (for a fee). Click Done.
An e-mail is sent to you.
5. Reply to the e-mail to activate your account, and you’re ready to go.

Sharing a photo album online
To share a photo album, you simply mark the album as Shared in Elements.
Shared albums are then uploaded to your Photoshop.com account and dis-
played on your personal URL.
Follow these steps to share a photo album online:
1. On the Organize panel, select an existing photo album name and
then click the Share icon to the right of the album’s name.
To create a new online album, click the Online Album button on the
Share panel. Or, you can click the Add icon on the Organize tab, select
New Album, and then select Share To: Photoshop.com. Next, click the
Add Photos button (the Plus Sign [+] icon) in the gallery section and
drag and drop photos to the Add Photos panel.
2. Customize the title and subtitle, change your background color, and
show any captions. Click Next.
3. In the Album Details panel, click Change Template to change your
photo gallery template, if desired. Select Photoshop.com to share
your photos online.
You can also choose to export your photos to CD/DVD or an FTP site.
4. Click Next.
5. Specify your sharing options, as shown in Figure 4-23.
Choose whether to share your photos publicly or by invitation only via
e-mail. For invites only, type your message and specify your invitees.
Choose whether viewers can download or order prints of the photos.
6. Click Share.
Elements cranks away and then gives you a message that your album
has been created and will be available after the upload is complete. A
completed online photo album displayed on Photoshop.com is shown
in Figure 4-24.
Here are a few other tidbits regarding online albums:
 Online albums are listed on the Organize panel with an Online Album
icon to the right of the name.
 To make changes to an online album, right-click (Control-click on the
Mac) the album name.
 To stop sharing an album, select the album in the Organize pane and
click the Stop Sharing icon to the right of the name.

Sharing Photos Online
625
 When you add or delete images from your online album, Elements auto-
matically updates your photo album online.
 Click the Web Gallery button on Elements’ Welcome screen to be trans-
ported to Photoshop.com, where you can view online albums.

Backing up and synchronizing your files
Photoshop.com enables you to back up and synchronize your files. Why
would you want to back up and synchronize? First of all, it lets you access
your photos and other media assets from any Web browser by using your
Photoshop.com account. This may be useful if you travel a lot or just like 
to be able to access your home images from work, or vice versa. Any changes
you make — adding, deleting, reorganizing, or editing photos — are synchro-
nized to your Photoshop Elements desktop. If you edit your images, they
don’t overwrite the originals on your desktop, but instead create a version
set, thereby giving you the option of using the original or the edited version.
Secondly, if your computer crashes and burns, you can restore your catalog
to a new computer by logging onto your Photoshop.com account. Then
simply choose Edit➪Preferences➪Backup/Synchronization, select the
albums you want restored to your new computer by selecting the Sync
check box next to each album, and click OK.
Follow these steps to set up your Backup/Synchronization preferences:
1. Log onto your Photoshop.com account.
2. On the Elements Welcome screen, click the Backup Settings button in
the Photoshop.com Membership panel on the left.
You can also choose Edit➪Preferences➪Backup/Synchronization in the
Organizer (Adobe Bridge➪Preferences for Adobe Bridge for Mac users).
3. In the Backup/Synchronization preferences panel, specify your options.
For example, choose whether, when you choose the Delete option for a
file online, you want Elements to ask whether you want to delete that file
from your computer. The alternative is to have Elements delete the file
automatically.
4. Click OK.
Getting help with Elements from Photoshop.com
Photoshop.com offers you a lot of help via tutorials that Adobe and other
