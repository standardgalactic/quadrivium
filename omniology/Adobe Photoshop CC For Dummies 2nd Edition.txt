Introduction      1
Introduction
A
dobe Photoshop CC is one of the most important computer programs of 
our age. It’s made photo editing a commonplace thing, something for the 
everyperson. Still, Photoshop can be a scary thing, comprising a jungle of 
menus and panels and tools and options and shortcuts as well as a bewildering 
array of add-ons and plug-ins. And that’s why you’re holding this book in your 
hands. And why I wrote it. And why John Wiley & Sons published it.
You want to make sense of Photoshop — or, at the very least, be able to work 
competently and efficiently in the program, accomplishing those tasks that need 
to get done. You want a reference that discusses how things work and what things 
do, not in a technogeek or encyclopedic manner, but rather as an experienced 
friend might explain something to you. Although step-by-step explanations are 
okay if they show how something works, you don’t need rote recipes that don’t 
apply to the work you do. You don’t mind discovering tricks, as long as they can be 
applied to your images and artwork in a productive, meaningful manner. You’re 
in the right place!
About This Book
This is a For Dummies book, and as such, it was produced with an eye toward you 
and your needs. From Day One, the goal has been to put into your hands the book 
that makes Photoshop CC understandable and usable. You won’t find a technical 
explanation of every option for every tool in every situation, but rather a concise 
explanation of those parts of Photoshop CC you’re most likely to need. If you hap-
pen to be a medical researcher working toward a cure for cancer, your Photoshop 
requirements might be substantially more specific than what you’ll find covered 
here. But for the overwhelming majority of the people who have access to Adobe 
Photoshop, this book provides the background needed to get your work done with 
Photoshop.
As I updated this book, I intentionally tried to strike a balance between the types 
of images with which you’re most likely to work and those visually stimulat-
ing (yet far less common) images of unusual subjects from faraway places. At no 
point in this book does flavor override foundation. When you need to see a practical 

2      Adobe Photoshop CC For Dummies
example, that’s what I show you. I worked to ensure that each piece of artwork 
illustrates a technique and does so in a meaningful, nondistracting way for you.
You’ll see that I used mostly Apple computers in producing this book. That’s sim-
ply a matter of choice and convenience. You’ll also see (if you look closely) that I 
shoot mostly with Canon cameras and use Epson printers. That doesn’t mean that 
you shouldn’t shoot with Nikon, or that you shouldn’t print with HP or Canon. If 
that’s what you have, if it’s what you’re comfortable with, and if it fulfills your 
needs, stick with it! You’ll also find that I mention Wacom drawing tablets here 
and there (and devoted one of the final chapters to the subject). Does that mean 
you should have one? If you do any work that relies on precise cursor movement 
(like painting, dodging, burning, path creation and editing, cloning, healing, 
patching, or lassoing, just to name a few), yes, I do recommend a Wacom Cintiq 
display or Intuos tablet. Next to more RAM and good color management, it’s the 
best investment just about any Photoshop user can make. There are other brands 
of tablets that are compatible with Photoshop, but Wacom is the only brand I use 
and recommend.
One additional note: If you’re brand new to digital imaging and computers, this 
probably isn’t the best place to start. I do indeed make certain assumptions about 
your level of computer knowledge (and, to a lesser degree, your knowledge of 
digital imaging). But if you know your File ➪ Open from your File ➪ Close and can 
find your lens cap with both hands, read Chapter 1, and you’ll have no problem 
with Photoshop CC For Dummies.
Conventions Used in This Book
To save some space and maintain clarity, I use an arrow symbol as shorthand for 
Photoshop menu commands. I could write this:
Move the cursor onto the word Image at the top of your screen and press the 
mouse button. Continuing to press the mouse button, move the cursor downward 
to the word Adjustments. Still pressing the mouse button, move the cursor to the 
right and downward onto the words Shadow/Highlight. Release the mouse button.
But it makes more sense to write this:
Choose Shadow/Highlight from the Image ➪ Adjustments menu.
Or even to use this:
Choose Image ➪ Adjustments ➪ Shadow/Highlight.

Introduction      3
You’ll also note that I include keyboard shortcuts (when applicable) for both Mac 
and Windows. Generally the shortcuts are together, with Mac always first, and 
look like this:
Move the selection to a separate layer with the shortcut ⌘  +Shift+J/Ctrl+Shift+J.
Icons Used in This Book
You’ll see icons in the margins as you read this book, icons that indicate some-
thing special. Here, without further ado, is the gallery:
This icon tells you I’m introducing a new feature, something just added to the 
program with Photoshop CC. If you’re brand new to Photoshop yourself, you can 
ignore this icon — it’s all new to you. If you’re an experienced Photoshop user, 
take note.
When I have a little secret or shortcut to share with you — something that can 
make your life easier, smoother, more convenient — you see the Tip icon.
This icon doesn’t appear very often, but when it does, read carefully! I reserve 
the Warning icon for those things that can really mess up your day — things that 
can cause you to lose work by ruining your file or prevent Photoshop from ful-
filling your wishes. If there were to be a quiz afterward, every Warning would be 
included!
The Remember icon shows you good-to-know stuff, things that are applicable in 
a number of different places in Photoshop, or things that can make your Photo-
shop life easier.
You might notice this icon in a place or two in the book. It’s not common because 
I exclude most of the highly technical background info: you know, the boring 
techno-geek concepts behind Photoshop. But when you do see the icon, it indi-
cates something that you probably should know.
How to Use This Book
This is a reference book, not a lesson-based workbook or a tips-and-tricks 
­cookbook. When you have a question about how something in Photoshop works, 
flip to the Table of Contents or the index to find your spot. You certainly can read 

4      Adobe Photoshop CC For Dummies
the chapters in order, cover to cover, to make sure that you get the most out of it. 
Nonetheless, keep this book handy while you work in Photoshop. (Reading cover 
to cover not only ensures that you find out the most about Photoshop, but it guar-
antees that you don’t miss a single cartoon or joke.)
Unless you’re borrowing a friend’s copy or you checked this book out of the library 
or you’re reading it on your iPad, I suggest you get comfortable with the thought 
of sticky notes and bent page corners. Photoshop is a very complex program —  
no one knows everything about Photoshop. And many concepts and techniques 
in Photoshop are hard to remember, especially if you don’t use them often. 
­Bookmark those pages so they’re easy to find next time because you’re sure to be 
coming back time and again to Photoshop CC For Dummies.
Also be sure to check out this book’s cheat sheet. Go to dummies.com and search

Welcome to Photoshop!
A
dobe Photoshop is, without question, the leading image-editing program 
in the world. Photoshop has even become somewhat of a cultural icon. It’s 
not uncommon to hear Photoshop used as a verb (“That picture is obvi-
ously Photoshopped!”), and you’ll even see references to Photoshop in the daily 
comics and cartoon strips. And now you’re part of this whole gigantic phenom-
enon called Photoshop.
Before I take you on this journey through the intricacies of Photoshop, I want to 
introduce you to Photoshop in a more general way. In this chapter, I tell you what 
Photoshop is designed to do, what it can do (although not as capably as job-specific 
software), and what you can get it to do if you try really, really hard. I also review 
some basic computer operation concepts and point out a couple of places where 
Photoshop is a little different than most other programs. At the end of the chapter, 
I have a few tips for you on installing Photoshop to ensure that it runs properly.
Exploring Adobe Photoshop
Photoshop is used for an incredible range of projects, from editing and correct-
ing digital photos to preparing images for magazines and newspapers to creating 
graphics for the web. You can also find Photoshop in the forensics departments of 
law-enforcement agencies, scientific labs and research facilities, and dental and

medical offices, as well as in classrooms, offices, studios, and homes around the 
world. As the Help Desk Director for KelbyOne (formerly the National Association 
of Photoshop Professionals), my team and I solve problems and provide solutions 
for Photoshop users from every corner of the computer graphics field and from 
every corner of the world. People are doing some pretty amazing things with Pho-
toshop, many of which are so far from the program’s original roots that it boggles 
the mind!
What Photoshop is designed to do
Adobe Photoshop is an image-editing program. It’s designed to help you edit 
images  — digital or digitized images, photographs, and otherwise. This is the 
core purpose of Photoshop. Over the years, Photoshop has grown and developed, 
adding features that supplement its basic operations. But at its heart, Photoshop 
is an image editor. At its most basic, Photoshop’s workflow goes something like 
this: You take a picture, you edit the picture, and you print the picture (as illus-
trated in Figure 1-1). (Of course, many images never make it to paper — they are 
only shared on social media.)
Whether captured with a digital camera, scanned into the computer, or created 
from scratch in Photoshop, your artwork consists of tiny squares of color, which 
are picture elements called pixels. (I explore pixels and the nature of digital imag-
ing in-depth in Chapter 2.) Photoshop is all about changing and adjusting the 
colors of those pixels — collectively, in groups, or one at a time — to make your 
artwork look precisely how you want it to look. (Photoshop, by the way, has no 
Good Taste or Quality Art button. It’s up to you to decide what suits your artistic or 
personal vision and what meets your professional requirements.) Some very com-
mon Photoshop image-editing tasks are shown in Figure 1-2: namely, correcting 
red-eye and minimizing wrinkles (both discussed in Chapter 9); and compositing 
images (see Chapter 10).

Photoshop works with actual vector shapes, such as those created in Adobe 
­Illustrator. Photoshop also has a very capable brush engine, including erodible 
brush tips (they wear down and need to be resharpened) and airbrush and water-
color brush tips, further extending the fine art painting capabilities of the program. 
Figure 1-3 shows a comparison of raster artwork (the digital photo, left), vector 
artwork (the illustration, center), and digital painting (right). The three types of 
artwork can appear in a single image, too. (Creating vector artwork is presented in 
Chapter 11, and you can read about painting with Photoshop in Chapter 14.)
Photoshop also includes some basic features for creating web graphics, including 
slicing and animations (see Chapter 17 for info on video and animation). (Web 
work is best done in a true web development program, such as Dreamweaver. 
If you want to learn about creating websites, pick up a copy of Dreamweaver 
For Dummies.).
Other things you can do with Photoshop
Admittedly, Photoshop just plain can’t do some things. It won’t make you a good 
cup of coffee. It can’t press your trousers. It doesn’t vacuum under the couch.

It isn’t even a substitute for iTunes, Microsoft Excel, or TurboTax — it just doesn’t 
do those things.
However, there are a number of things for which Photoshop isn’t designed that 
you can do in a pinch. If you don’t have InDesign, you can still lay out the pages 
of a newsletter, magazine, or even a book, one page at a time. If you don’t have 
Dreamweaver, you can use Photoshop to create a website, one page at a time, 
sliced and optimized and even with animated GIFs. And while you’re probably 
not going to create the next blockbuster on your laptop with Photoshop, the video 
editing capabilities can certainly get you through the family reunion or that school 
project.
Viewing Photoshop’s Parts and Processes
In many respects, Photoshop is just another computer program — you launch the 
program, open files, save files, and quit the program quite normally. Many com-
mon functions have common keyboard shortcuts. You enlarge, shrink, minimize, 
and close windows as you do in other programs.
Reviewing basic computer operations
Chapter 3 looks at Photoshop-specific aspects of working with floating panels, 
menus and submenus, and tools from the Options bar, but I want to take just a 
little time to review some fundamental computer concepts.
Launching Photoshop
You can launch Photoshop (start the program) by double-clicking an image file or 
through the Applications folder (Mac) or the Start menu (Windows). Mac users 
can drag the Photoshop program icon (the actual program itself, with the .app file 
extension) to the Dock to make it available for one-click startup. (Chapter 3 shows 
you the Photoshop interface and how to get around in the program.)
Never open an image into Photoshop from removable media (CD, DVD, your digi-
tal camera or its Flash card, jump drives, and the like) or from a network drive. 
Always copy the file to a local hard drive, open from that drive, save back to the 
drive, and then copy the file to its next destination. You can open from internal 
hard drives or external hard drives, but to avoid the risk of losing your work (or 
the entire image file) because of a problem reading from or writing to remov-
able media, always copy to a local hard drive. If you’re in a workgroup situation 
and must use a network drive, consider Adobe Drive CC (available for free from 
www.Adobe.com).

CHAPTER 1  Welcome to Photoshop!     11
Working with images
Within Photoshop, you work with individual image files. Each image is recorded 
on the hard drive in a specific file format. Photoshop opens just about any cur-
rent image file consisting of pixels as well as some file formats that do not. (File 
formats are discussed in Chapter 2.) Remember that to change a file’s format, 
you open the file in Photoshop and use the Save As command to create a new file. 
And, although theoretically not always necessary on the Mac, I suggest that you 
always include the file extension at the end of the filename. If Photoshop won’t 
open an image, it might be in a file format that Photoshop can’t read. It cannot, 
for example, open an Excel spreadsheet or a Microsoft Word document because 
those aren’t image formats — and Photoshop is, as you know, an image-editing 
program.
If you have a brand-new digital camera and Photoshop won’t open its Raw images, 
choose Help ➪ Updates from Photoshop’s main menu to install the latest version 
of the Camera Raw plug-in. (But remember that it takes a little time to prepare 
Camera Raw for new file formats. If you purchase a new camera on its first day 
of release, you may need to use the software that came with the camera until the 
next Camera Raw update is released.)
Saving your files
You must use the Save or Save As command to preserve changes to your images. 
And after you save and close an image, some of those changes may be irreversible. 
When working with an important image, consider these tips:
»
» Work on a copy of the image file. Unless you’re working with a digital photo 
in the Raw format (discussed in Chapter 7), make a copy of your image file as 
a backup before changing it in Photoshop. The backup ensures that should 
something go horribly wrong, you can start over. (You never actually change a 
Raw photo — Photoshop can’t rewrite the original file — so you’re always, in 
effect, working on a copy.)
»
» Activate auto recovery. In Photoshop’s Preferences ➪ File Handling pane, 
make sure that the Automatically Save Recovery Information Every: option is 
selected and set to an appropriate time interval. If Photoshop crashes while 
you’re working, when you re-open the program, it will (hopefully) be able to 
present you with your artwork at the stage when last saved for auto recovery.
»
» Save your work as PSD file, too. Especially if your image has layers, save it in 
Photoshop’s PSD file format (complete with all the layers) before using Save 
As to create a final copy in another format. If you don’t save a copy with layers, 
going back to make one little change can cost hours of work.

12     PART 1  Getting Started with Photoshop CC
Rather than choosing File ➪ Open, consider making it a habit to choose File ➪ Open 
As Smart Object. When working with Smart Objects, you can scale or transform 
multiple times without continually degrading the image quality, and you can work 
with Smart Filters, too! (You can read about Smart Filters in Chapter 15.)
If you attempt to close an image or 
quit Photoshop without saving your 
work first, you get a gentle reminder 
asking whether you want to save, 
close without saving, or cancel the 
close/quit (as shown in Figure 1-4).
Keyboard shortcuts
Keyboard shortcuts are customizable 
in Photoshop (check out Chapter  3), 
but some of the basic shortcuts are the same as those you use in other programs. 
You open, copy, paste, save, close, and quit just as you do in Microsoft Word, 
your e-mail program, and just about any other software. I suggest that you keep 
these shortcuts unchanged, even if you do some other shortcut customization. 
Okay, well, I do recommend one change to the standard keyboard shortcuts. See 
­Chapter 3 for my recommendation on shortcuts for the Edit menu’s Undo/Redo 
and Step Backward actions.
Photoshop’s incredible selective Undo
Here’s one major difference between Photoshop and other programs. Almost all 
programs have some form of Undo, enabling you to reverse the most recent com-
mand or action (or mistake). Photoshop also has, however, a great feature that lets 
you partially undo. The History Brush tool can partially undo just about any filter, 
adjustment, or tool — by painting. You select the History Brush, choose a history 
state (a stage in the image development) to which you want to revert, and then 
paint over areas of the image that you want to change back to the earlier state.
You can undo as far back in the editing process as you want, with a couple of 
limitations: The History panel (where you select the state to which you want 
to revert) holds only a limited number of history states. In the Photoshop 
­Preferences ➪ ­Performance pane, you can specify how many states you want 
­Photoshop to remember (to a maximum of 1,000). Keep in mind that storing lots of 
history states takes up computer memory that you might need for processing fil-
ters and adjustments. That can slow things down. The default of 20 history states 
is good for most projects, but when using painting tools or other procedures that 
involve lots of repetitive steps (such as touching up with the Dodge, Burn, or Clone 
Stamp tools), a larger number (perhaps as high as 60) is generally a better idea.
FIGURE 1-4: 
Photoshop reminds you if you haven’t saved 
changes to an image.

CHAPTER 1  Welcome to Photoshop!     13
The second limitation is pixel dimensions. If you make changes to the image’s 
actual size (in pixels) with the Crop tool, the Image ➪ Crop command, or the 
Image Size or Canvas Size commands (both in the Image menu), you cannot revert 
to prior steps with the History Brush tool. You can choose as a source any history 
state that comes after the image’s pixel dimensions change but none that come 
before.
Here’s one example of using the History Brush as a creative tool. You open a copy 
of a photograph in Photoshop. You edit as necessary. You use the Black & White 
adjustment on the image to make it appear to be grayscale. In the History panel, 
you click in the left column next to a snapshot (a saved history state) or the step 
prior to Black & White to designate that as the source state, the appearance of the 
image to which you want to revert. You select the History Brush tool and paint 
over specific areas of the image to return them to the original (color) appearance 
(see Figure 1-5). There you have it — a grayscale image with areas of color, com-
pliments of the History Brush tool!
FIGURE 1-5:

Brush, with the

14     PART 1  Getting Started with Photoshop CC
Photoshop has another very powerful partial Undo in the Fade command. Found 
in the Edit menu, Fade can be used immediately after just about any tool or 
adjustment or filter or, well, almost anything that changes the appearance of the 
image. (You can even fade the History Brush tool.) The Fade command enables 
you to change the opacity and/or the blending mode of whatever alteration you 
most recently made to the appearance of your artwork with tools or commands. 
You might, for example, use a Sharpen filter and then use the Fade command to 
change the filter’s blending mode to Luminosity. That’s the functional equivalent 
of sharpening the L channel in Lab color mode without having to switch color 
modes at all. Keep in mind that when I use the word “immediately,” I really mean 
it — you can’t even use the Save command between applying a filter and using 
the Fade command.
Installing Photoshop: Need to know
If you haven’t yet installed Photoshop here are a few points to keep in mind:
»
» Install only into the default location. Photoshop is a resource-intensive 
program. Installing it into the default location (harddrive ➪ Applications 
on a Mac and C:\Program Files for Windows) ensures that it has access to 
the operating system and hardware as necessary. Installing into any other 
location or attempting to run Photoshop across a network can lead to 
frustrating problems and loss of work in progress.
»
» Disable all spyware and antivirus software before installing. Antivirus 
software can intercept certain installation procedures, deeming them to be 
hazardous to your computer’s health. That can lead to malfunctions, crashes, 
lost work, frustration, and what I like to call Computer Flying Across the Room 
Syndrome. If you use antivirus software (and if you use Windows, you’d 
better!), turn it off before installing any program, especially one as complex as 
Photoshop. You might find the antivirus program’s icon in the Windows 
taskbar; or you might need to go to the Start menu, choose All Programs to 
locate the antivirus software, and disable it. On Mac, check the Dock. And 
don’t forget to restart your antivirus software afterward! If you already 
installed Photoshop and antivirus software was running at the time, I urge you 
to uninstall and reinstall.
»
» If you use auto-backup software, shut it down, too. It’s best not to run 
auto-backup software when installing software. Like antivirus software, it can 
also lead to problems by interfering with the installer.
»
» Connect to the Internet and activate right away. It’s also best to run the 
Photoshop installer while your computer is connected to the Internet. That 
enables Photoshop’s activation and registration process to happen right away, 
making sure that you can get started as soon as the installer finishes.

CHAPTER 1  Welcome to Photoshop!     15
»
» If you have third-party plug-ins, install them elsewhere. Third-party 
plug-ins — those filters and other Photoshop add-ons that you buy from 
companies other than Adobe — can be installed into a folder outside the 
Photoshop folder. You can then make an alias (Mac) or shortcut (Windows) to 
that folder and drag the alias/shortcut to Photoshop’s Plug-Ins folder. Why 
install outside the Photoshop folder? Should you ever need to (gasp!) reinstall 
Photoshop, you won’t need to reinstall all your third-party plug-ins. Just create 
a new alias/shortcut and move it into Photoshop’s new Plug-Ins folder. And 
don’t forget to go to the plug-ins’ websites to see whether the manufacturers 
offer updates!
»
» If you have lots of plug-ins, create sets. Plug-ins require random–access 
memory (RAM) (computer memory that Photoshop uses to process your 
editing commands). If you have lots of plug-ins, consider dividing them into 
groups according to how and when you use them. Sort (or install) them into 
separate folders. (Hint: Plug-ins that you use in many situations can be 
installed into multiple folders.) When you need to load a specific set, swap out 
the alias or shortcut in the Plug-Ins folder and restart Photoshop.
»
» If you love fonts, use a font management utility. If you have hundreds of 
fonts (over the years, I’ve somehow managed to collect upward of 12,000 
fonts), use a font-management utility to create sets of fonts according to style 
and activate only those sets that you need at any given time. Too many active 
fonts can choke the Photoshop type engine, slowing performance. The Mac 
OS has Font Book built right in, or you can use the excellent Suitcase Fusion 
(Mac and Windows) from Extensis (www.extensis.com).


CHAPTER 2  Knowing Just Enough about Digital Images     17
Knowing Just Enough 
about Digital Images
I
n the early days of photography, some less-advanced cultures viewed a photo 
with great suspicion and even fear. Was that an actual person, trapped in the 
paper? Did taking a photo steal a person’s soul? You know that a camera doesn’t 
trap anyone inside the paper — and you can be pretty sure about the stolen soul 
issue  — but how much does the average shooter know about digital images? 
And how much do you need to know about digital images to work effectively in 
Photoshop?
The answers to those two questions are “Not as much as he/she should” and “Not 
as much as you might fear.” In this chapter, I give you some basic information 
about how digital images exist in Photoshop, a real understanding of that criti-
cal term resolution, and an overview of the different ways that you can save your 
images. But most importantly, I help you understand the very nature of digital 
images by explaining the world of pixels.

18     PART 1  Getting Started with Photoshop CC
What Exactly Is a Digital Image?
Whether you take a picture with a digital camera or use a scanner to bring a photo 
(or other artwork) into Photoshop, you are digitizing the image. That is, digit not 
as in a finger or toe, but as in a number. Computers do everything — absolutely 
everything  — by processing numbers, and the basic language of computers is 
binary code. Whether it’s a photo of a Tahitian sunset, a client’s name in a data-
base, or the latest box score on the Internet, your computer works on it in binary 
code. In a nutshell, binary code uses a series of zeros and ones (that’s where the 
numbers part comes into play) to record information.
So what does binary code have to do 
with the wedding photos that you 
took this weekend or the masterpiece 
you must print for your thesis proj-
ect? An image in Photoshop consists 
of tiny squares of color called pixels 
(pixel is short for picture element), as 
you can see in the close-up to the 
right in Figure  2-1. The computer 
records and processes each pixel in 
binary code. These pixels replicate 
a photo the same way that tiles in a 
mosaic reproduce a painting.
A tile in a mosaic isn’t face or sky or grass; rather, it’s beige or blue or green. The 
tiles individually have no relationship to the image as a whole; rather, they require 
an association with the surrounding tiles to give them purpose, to make them part 
of the picture. Without the rest of the tiles, a single tile has no meaning.
Likewise, a single pixel in a digital image is simply a square of color. It doesn’t 
become a meaningful part of your digital image until it’s surrounded by other 
pixels of the same or different color, creating a unified whole — a comprehensible 
picture. How you manipulate those pixels, from the time you capture the image 
digitally until you output the image to paper or the web, determines how success-
fully your pixels will represent your image, your artwork, your dream.
The True Nature of Pixels
Here are some basic truths about pixels that you really need to know. Although 
reading this section probably can’t improve your love life, let you speak with 
FIGURE 2-1: 
That’s not really Hugo the Bulldog; it’s a bunch 
of tiny, colored squares.

CHAPTER 2  Knowing Just Enough about Digital Images     19
ghosts, or give you the winning lottery number, it can help you understand what’s 
happening to your image as you work with it in Photoshop.
»
» Each pixel is independent. You might think that you see a car or a circle or a 
tree or Uncle Bob in an image, but the image is actually only a bunch of little 
colored squares. Although you can read about various ways to work with 
groups of pixels throughout this book, each pixel exists unto itself.
»
» Each pixel is square (except on TV). Really! Each pixel in a digital image 
is square except when you’re creating images for some television formats, 
which use nonsquare pixels. It’s important that you understand the square-
ness of pixels because you sometimes have to deal with those pointy little 
corners.
»
» Each pixel can be 
exactly one color. 
That color can change 
as you edit or alter 
the image, but each 
pixel consists entirely 
of a single color —  
there’s no such thing 
as a two-tone pixel. 
Figure 2-2, at 3,200 
percent zoom, shows 
each pixel distinctly.
»
» Smaller is better 
(generally speaking). 
The smaller each pixel, the better the detail in an image. (However, when you 
are preparing images for the web, you need smaller images that invariably 
have less detail.) If you capture an image of a house with an older cellphone 
camera and capture the same shot with a new DSLR (digital single-lens 
reflex camera — you know, one of the cameras with interchangeable lenses) 
that captures three or seven or fifteen times as many pixels — it’s pretty 
obvious which image has better detail. Take a look at Figure 2-3, which 
illustrates how lots more smaller pixels present a better image than do 
fewer-and-larger pixels.
Smaller pixels also help hide those nasty corners of pixels that are sometimes 
visible along curves and diagonal lines. When the corners of pixels are 
noticeable and degrade the image, you call it a bad case of the jaggies.
FIGURE 2-2: 
Each pixel is monotone, containing a single color throughout 
the pixel.

20     PART 1  Getting Started with Photoshop CC
Keep in mind that the size at which an image can be printed — and still look 
good — depends on the number of pixels available. Sure, these days every 
cellphone seems to capture at least 10 megapixels, which is fine for 8x10 
prints and perhaps even as large as 16x20 inches. But how about when your 
10-megapixel pocket camera doesn’t have a long enough zoom to capture 
little Tommy’s exploits on the far side of the soccer field? That’s when you 
might need to crop and resample the image to increase the number of pixels. 
Resampling is discussed later in this chapter.
»
» Pixels are aligned in a raster. The term raster appears regularly when you 
discuss images created from pixels. Raster, in this case, refers to the nice 
orderly rows and columns in which pixels appear. Each image has a certain 
number of rows of pixels, and each row is a certain number of pixels wide —  
the columns. Within the raster, the pixels perfectly align side to side and top 
to bottom.
»
» Every picture created with pixels is rectangular. Some images might 
appear to be round, or star-shaped, or missing a hole from the middle, but 
they aren’t unless you print them and grab your scissors. The image file 
itself is rectangular, even if it appears round. Pixels actually exist in those 
seemingly empty areas; the pixels are, however, transparent. When printing, 
the transparent areas show the color of the paper you’re using.
FIGURE 2-3: 
More pixels 
(top) means 
better detail. 
Note the zoom 
factors in the 
lower left of 
each window.

CHAPTER 2  Knowing Just Enough about Digital Images     21
How Many Pixels Can Dance  
on the Head of a Pin?
You hear the term resolution a lot when working with digital images. Digital 
­cameras have so-many megapixels of resolution; inkjet printers have so-much by 
so-much resolution; to work in Photoshop, your monitor must have a resolution of 
at least 1,024 x 768 pixels; when printing your images, you must use 300 pixels 
per inch (ppi) as your resolution (wrong!), but your web images must have a 
resolution of 72 ppi (again wrong!); and don’t forget your New Year’s resolution!
Resolution revelations
In this wonderful world of digital imaging, you see resolution used in four 
basic ways:
»
» Image resolution: Image resolution is the size of your image’s individual pixels 
when you print. I go into greater detail about this concept in the upcoming 
section, “Picking an image resolution.”
»
» Camera resolution: Digital cameras capture each image in a specific number 
of pixels. Check your camera’s user guide or open one of the images in 
Photoshop and choose Image ➪ Image Size. Take a look at the number of 
pixels that your camera records for the width and for the height. Multiply the 
numbers together, divide by one million, and round off the result. (If you’re in 
the camera maker’s marketing department, make sure that you round up.) 
That’s the megapixel (MP) rating for the camera. Use it as a general guideline 
when shopping. But remember that a camera with lower resolution using an 
excellent lens generally produces a better print than a camera with more 
megapixels using a less expensive lens.
»
» Monitor resolution: Monitor resolution determines how many pixels are 
visible on-screen. Whether you use a Mac or a PC, you set the monitor 
resolution at the system level (as shown in Figure 2-4). When you use a higher 
monitor resolution, you get a larger workspace, but each pixel is smaller, 
which might make some jobs tougher. Experiment to find a monitor resolu-
tion that works just right for you.
»
» Printer resolution: Unlike the three preceding terms, printer resolution doesn’t 
involve pixels. Rather, a printer resolution tells you how many tiny droplets of 
ink are sprayed on the paper. Remember that it takes several droplets to 
reproduce a single image pixel — you certainly don’t need an image resolution 
anywhere close to the printer’s resolution! (See the following section for more 
on this.)

22     PART 1  Getting Started with Photoshop CC
Resolving image resolution
Image resolution is nothing more than an instruction to a printing device about 
how large to reproduce each pixel. On-screen, when working in Photoshop, your 
image has no resolution at all. An image that’s 3,000 pixels wide and 2,400 pixels 
tall looks and acts exactly the same in Photoshop whether you have the image res-
olution at 300 ppi or 72 ppi. Same number of pixels, right? (The one real ­exception 
to this rule is type — text is usually measured in points in Photoshop, and that 
measurement is directly tied to the print size of your document. Type and text are 
discussed in Chapter 13.)
You can always check — or change — a picture’s resolution by choosing Photoshop 
Image ➪ Image Size. Photoshop CC’s new Image Size dialog box (which you can 
see in Figure 2-5) offers the Fit To menu, which you can use to save and load pre-
sets for changes that you make regularly. The Resample box needs to be selected 
when changing pixel dimensions (otherwise you just change the image’s resolu-
tion). Next to Dimensions you can click the arrow to select a unit of measure, as 
you can next to Width, Height, and even Resolution. But the coolest new feature of 
the revamped Image Size dialog box is the preview. Position the cursor within the 
window and you can drag to reposition the preview and change the zoom factor. 
And rather than dragging and dragging and dragging in the small window to move 
the preview to a distant part of the image, simply click that area in the image 
FIGURE 2-4:

CHAPTER 2  Knowing Just Enough about Digital Images     23
itself to jump the preview to that location. The Reduce Noise slider can be used to 
minimize the amount of little speckles that sometimes appear when resampling 
an image.
You’ll find it very handy to change the pixel dimensions and the print size at 
the same time in the Image Size dialog box. And, much to the delight of math-
challenged folks, the Image Size feature does most of the calculations for you. 
For example, with the Link option selected (note the tiny Link icon to the left 
of the Width and Height boxes), you enter a new Width and Photoshop calcu-
lates the new Height automatically! To disable this option so that you can change 
only the width or the height (which is rare), just click the Link icon.
Changing the size of your artwork  
with the Image Size command
You have a number of ways to change the size of your photos and other art. In 
Chapter 4, I introduce you to cropping (chopping off part of the artwork to make it 
fit a certain size or to improve its overall appearance and impact). You can also use 
Photoshop’s Image Size command to change the image dimensions or printing 
instructions without altering the composition, which is the visual arrangement of 
the image or artwork. All the content of the original image is there, just at a differ-
ent size. Of course, as you can see in Figure 2-6, if you reduce the size of an image 
too much, some of that original content can become virtually unrecognizable.
FIGURE 2-5: 
The Image 
Size dialog 
box includes 
a ­preview 
­window 
and noise 
­reduction.

24     PART 1  Getting Started with Photoshop CC
If you know the specific pixel dimensions 
that you need for the final image — say for 
a web page — you can simply type a new 
number in the Width or Height fields in 
the Image Size dialog box and click OK. Of 
course, you probably want a little more con-
trol over the process, don’t you? Figure 2-7 
gives you a closer look at the resampling 
options in the Image Size dialog box, with 
suggestions on when to use each.
If you’re resizing an image that uses layer 
styles (see Chapter 12), you want to click the 
gear button in the upper-right corner of the 
Image Size dialog box and make sure that 
the Scale Styles check box is selected to preserve the image’s appearance as it 
shrinks or grows. In a nutshell, layer styles (such as shadows, glows, and bevels) 
are applied to a layer at a specific size. You can scale the image without changing 
those sizes, or you can scale the image and change the style sizes proportion-
ally. Not scaling layer styles can dramatically alter the appearance of a resized 
image, as you can see in Figure 2-8. A slight bevel combined with a small drop 
shadow produces a subtle 3D effect in the original (upper) image. Below, when the 
image is scaled down to ¼ the original size without scaling the effects, your chips 
change to chumps, and the artwork is ruined.
FIGURE 2-6: 
As the 
zoomed-in 
smaller image 
shows, you 
can reduce 
an image too 
much.
FIGURE 2-7: 
When the Preserve Details or Bicubic 
Smoother (enlargement) option is 
selected, you’ll also see a slider just 
below it in the Image Size dialog box to 
control noise in the enlargement.

CHAPTER 2  Knowing Just Enough about Digital Images     25
The link to the left of Width and 
Height should almost always remain 
selected. 
Some 
exceptions 
might 
come up, but you normally want to 
preserve an image’s aspect ratio (the 
relationship 
between 
height 
and 
width) when resizing to prevent dis-
torting the image. Figure 2-9 shows 
you what can happen when you scale 
one dimension without constraining 
the image’s proportions.
The Resample option is the one that might require the attention of that gray mat-
ter within your skull. Not only do you need to decide whether you want to resample 
the image (change its pixel dimensions), but you also need to decide how you want 
to resample. Refer to Figure 2-7 to see that you have seven different ways to cal-
culate the change (called resampling algorithms).
When you deselect the Resample option (as shown in Figure 2-10), you’re chang-
ing the print dimensions without changing the pixel dimensions of the image.
When using Image Size without resampling, you’re simply changing the instruc-
tions recorded in the image for your printing device. When you enter one 
­dimension, either width or height, Photoshop does the math and fills in both the 
other dimension and the new resolution.
FIGURE 2-8: 
Scaling an 
image without 
scaling its layer 
styles can ruin 
your image.
FIGURE 2-9: 
Resizing an image without constraining 
proportions. Interesting, yes, but useful?

26     PART 1  Getting Started with Photoshop CC
Take a look at Figure 2-11. I selected the Resample Image check box and entered 
10 and inches for my new print width to print this image to a letter-size 
(8.5 x 11 inches) sheet of paper. Photoshop fills in the new height (6.667 inches). 
But what if I want an 8x10 print? If I enter 8 and inches for the height, Photoshop 
recalculates the width to 12 inches. If I want a true 8 x 10, I have to crop some of 
the image because most digital photos have a different aspect ratio than an 8 x 10. 
(You can read more about that in Chapter 4.)
Okay then, back to the subject of resampling! When you resample an image 
(change the pixel dimensions), Photoshop takes the image and maps it to the new 
size, attempting to preserve the image’s appearances as much as possible at the 
new size, using the new number of pixels. Of course, if you take an image that’s 
more than 3,000 pixels wide and resample it to 300 pixels wide, you’re going to 
lose some of the detail. And, conversely, resampling an image from 300 pixels 
wide to 3,000 pixels wide, even when using the Preserve Details resampling algo-
rithm, is likely to introduce some softness to the image’s appearance.

TO RESAMPLE OR TO CROP:  
THAT IS THE QUESTION
To better understand the difference between resampling an image and cropping an 
image, consider this situation:
1.	 A painter paints a picture. He paints it at whatever size he thinks is appropriate. 
(Or, perhaps, on the only piece of canvas he can afford on that particular day.)
2.	 A patron likes the artwork, but the painting is too large for the frame that 
works best with the dining room table. Yeah, patrons can be like that, can’t they?
3.	 The patron asks the artist to make the painting fit the frame.
4.	 The artist decides between cropping and resampling. He can grab a pair of 
­scissors and cut off some of the painting (cropping) or painstakingly re-create the 
painting from scratch at a smaller size. Thankfully, Photoshop does the “repainting” 
for you, using Image Size with its resampling algorithms.
5.	 The artist charges the patron for the extra work. (Don’t forget this final, crucial step!)
Cropping cuts away part of the image to meet a target size. Resampling retains the entire 
image, but shrinks or enlarges it to meet the target size.

28     PART 1  Getting Started with Photoshop CC
Picking an image resolution
After you have the concept of resampling under your belt, how do you know what 
size you should be resampling to? How many pixels do you need? Here are your 
general guidelines:
»
» Photos for your inkjet printer: 
Inkjet printers are stochastic 
printing devices: That is, they use a 
series of droplets to replicate each 
pixel in your image, as shown in 
Figure 2-12. In theory, the optimal 
image resolution is one-third of 
the printer’s rated resolution. 
However, most printers don’t need 
an image resolution higher than 
300 ppi. (For fine art prints from 
my high-end Epson printers, I use 
an image resolution of 360 ppi.)
If you’re printing something that will only be viewed at a distance, such as a 
banner to be hung above the crowd or a poster that hangs on a wall, you can 
print at a substantially lower resolution to save ink and print faster. Banners, 
for example, can often be printed with a resolution of 100 ppi.
»
» Web images: Ignore resolution (including “72 ppi”). Consider only the image’s 
pixel dimensions. Determine what area of the web page the image will occupy 
and then resize to exactly those pixel dimensions. Remember, too, that some 
social media have specific guidelines for images uploaded to their sites. Check 
the site’s info before changing the image dimensions.
»
» Page layout programs and commercial printing: If your image is to be 
placed into a page layout program’s document and sent to a commercial 
printing facility, you need to know the line screen frequency (the resolution, so 
to speak) of the printing press on which the job will be run. Ask the print shop 
or the person handling the page layout. Your image resolution should be 
either exactly 1.5 times or exactly twice the line screen frequency. (You 
shouldn’t notice any difference in the final printed product with either 
resolution.)
»
» Presentation programs and word processing documents: Generally 
speaking, 72 ppi is appropriate for images that you place into a presentation 
or Word document. You should resize to the exact dimensions of the area on 
the page or slide that the image fills.

The close-up to the left shows inkjet printer 
droplets and to the right, pixels.

CHAPTER 2  Knowing Just Enough about Digital Images     29
CONTENT-AWARE SCALING
The Edit ➪ Content-Aware Scale command is designed to be used when an image needs 
to be resampled to a new aspect ratio but can’t be cropped. It tries (very hard) to keep the  
subject of the photo undistorted while stretching or shrinking the background. Here’s 
how to use it:
1.	 Open an image or make a selection. Make a selection if you need to scale only 
part of an image. If you need to resize the entire image, don’t make any selection.
2.	 Convert the Background layer. You can’t use Content-Aware Scale on a flattened 
image (an image that doesn’t support transparency). If your image has a layer 
named Background, click the lock icon to the right of the layer name in the Layers 
palette.
3.	 Choose Image ➪ Canvas Size. If increasing the pixel dimensions, resize the canvas 
as required. If you’re reducing the size of the image, skip this step.
4.	 Choose Edit ➪ Content-Aware Scale. Drag the anchor points in the center of the 
four sides of the bounding box that appears to resize to fill the new canvas, and then 
press Return/Enter. Hold down the Option/Alt key to scale from the center. If you’re 
resizing an image of one or more people, click the little “man” button to the right in 
the Options bar to protect skin tones. Before selecting Content-Aware Scale, you can 
also create an alpha channel (a saved selection) to identify areas of the image you 
want to protect. Make a selection, choose Select ➪ Save Selection, and then select 
that alpha channel on Content-Aware Scale’s Options bar in the Protect menu. See 
Chapter 8 for more on alpha channels.
5.	 Flatten (optional). If desired, choose Layer ➪ Flatten Image.
In this example, the original image is at the bottom. To the left, the image has been 
resampled from 6.67x10 inches to 8x10 inches using Image Size (with Constrain 
Proportions deselected). To the right, Content-Aware Scale does a much better job — 
in this particular case — of scaling the image to 8x10 inches, minimizing distortion of 
the subject.
Is Content-Aware Scale a substitute for properly composing in-camera before shooting? 
Absolutely not! Is it preferable to cropping to a new aspect ratio? Rarely. Is it an incred-
ibly powerful tool for certain difficult challenges? Now we’re talking!
(continued)

File Formats: Which Do You Need?
After working with your image in Photoshop, you need to save the changes. 
Choosing File ➪ Save updates the current file on your hard drive, maintaining the 
current file format when possible. If you added a feature to the file that isn’t sup-
ported by the original file format, Photoshop automatically opens the Save As 
dialog box and shows you which features are not supported by the selected file 
format. In Figure 2-13, the lower part of the Save As dialog box shows the yellow 
warning triangles that identify options being used in the image that are not avail-
able when saving as a JPEG.
You can go ahead and save the image in that format, but your file will no longer 
contain those unsupported features. In the example shown in Figure 2-13, I can 
click the Save button and create a JPEG file, but that JPEG won’t have the alpha 
channel (a saved selection) or the spot colors (a custom printing color) and it will 
be flattened to a single layer. If I want to retain those features in the file, I need to 
choose a different file format, such as Photoshop’s own PSD format. (Read more 
about alpha channels in Chapter 8 and about spot channels in Chapter 6.)
(continued)

CHAPTER 2  Knowing Just Enough about Digital Images     31
No matter which of the file formats you choose, if you add layers, type, adjustment 
layers, channels, or paths to your image, keep the original as an unflattened/
unmerged (all the layers are preserved) Photoshop (PSD) or layered TIFF file. In 
the future, should you ever need to make changes to the image or duplicate an 
effect in the image, you won’t need to start from scratch.
Formats for digital photos
If you print your images yourself at home or the office, you can stick with the PSD 
Photoshop format when saving. (Remember that you cannot re-save in a Raw 
format after opening in Photoshop.) If you send the photos to the local camera 
shop (or discount store) for printing, stick with JPEG — or, if the folks doing the 
printing accept it, TIFF. Here are the pros and cons of the major formats that you 
should consider for photos when saving:
»
» PSD: Photoshop’s native file format is great for saving your images with the 
most flexibility. Because the PSD format supports all of Photoshop’s features, 
you don’t need to flatten your images — and keeping your layers lets you 
make changes later. If your file size is very large (400MB or larger), make a TIFF 
or JPEG copy before printing, flattening all the layers. Don’t send PSD files to 
the local shop for prints.
»
» TIFF: Although the TIFF file format (as you use it in Photoshop) can save your 
layers and most other Photoshop features, make sure to choose Layers ➪  
Flatten Image before sending files for printing. Layered TIFF files generally are 
compatible only with programs in the Creative Cloud. The TIFF Options dialog 
box is shown in Figure 2-14.
FIGURE 2-13:

shows you 
which image 
features are 
not available in 
your selected 
file format.

32     PART 1  Getting Started with Photoshop CC
»
» JPG: JPEG, as it’s called, is actually a file compression scheme rather than a file 
format, but that’s not important. What is important is that JPEG throws away 
some of your image data when it saves the file. Save important images in PSD 
or TIFF and use JPEG only for copies.
When should you use JPEG? When sending images to a photo lab that doesn’t 
accept TIFF files, uploading to most social media sites, and when sending 
images (perhaps by e-mail or on CD) to people who don’t have Photoshop. 
Unlike PSD and TIFF, you can open JPEG images in a web browser and print 
from there — and so can Granny, and Cousin Jim, and that overseas soldier 
you adopted. When saving JPEGs, the lower the Quality setting you choose in 
the JPEG Options dialog box, the smaller the file, but also the more damage to 
the image. I discuss saving as JPEG in more detail in the sidebar “Resaving 
images in the JPEG format.”
»
» JPS: Jpeg Stereo is used to create steroscopic images that use the left half as 
one copy and the right half as another. It’s a specialty format for creating 
3D-looking photos. You may or may not ever use the file format, but who 
knows what’s right down the road? (Remember the “old days” when only a few 
cameras could capture Raw and when nobody knew what HDR stood for? 
Check out Chapter 7 for info on Raw and Chapter 20 for info on HDR.)
»
» PDF: It’s easy to overlook Adobe’s PDF format when talking about photos, but 
you should consider using this format. Although the local photo lab probably 
won’t accept it, it’s a great format for sharing your pictures with folks who 
don’t have Photoshop. Unlike JPEG, your images won’t be degraded when 
saving as PDF; and like JPEG, just about anyone with a computer can view the 
files. (Either Adobe Reader or the Mac’s Preview, which you can also use with 
PDFs, is found on just about every computer now, just like web browsers for 
JPEG.) Keep in mind, however, that PDF files are larger than JPEGs.
»
» Large Document Format (PSB): Really, really, really big pictures — more 
than 30,000 pixels wide or long or both — must be saved in the PSB or 
FIGURE 2-14: 
Remember 
to flatten TIFF 
files before 
saving when 
using them 
outside the 
Creative Cloud.

CHAPTER 2  Knowing Just Enough about Digital Images     33
TIFF file formats. Will you ever need this format? Consider that 30,000 pixels 
at a photo-quality resolution of 300 ppi is 100 inches long. At a resolution of 
85 ppi, more appropriate for a long banner to hang in a hallway, you’re talking 
about artwork that stretches almost 30 feet! Can your printer do that? If not, 
you probably don’t need the PSB file format.
You could theoretically use a number of other available formats, such as DCS 
(never Photoshop Raw), but there’s no real need with the more common and more 
versatile formats about which you just read.
The JPEG file format doesn’t support 16-bit color, but even when working with 
a 16-bit image (perhaps a Raw image from your digital camera), JPEG is avail-
able as a file format in Photoshop’s Save As dialog box. The image is automati-
cally converted to 8-bit color. It’s more convenient — saving you a trip to the 
Image ➪ Mode menu to select 8-Bits/Channel — but the JPEG Options dialog box 
won’t give you an estimate of the file size. Don’t forget to save in a format that 
supports 16-bit color, such as PSD or TIFF, before creating the JPEG copy.
Formats for web graphics
Generally speaking, you use Photoshop’s Save As to generate copies of your images 
for use on a website or to show off with smartphones, PDAs, and other such devices. 
You can, however, choose File ➪ Export ➪ Save for 
Web (Legacy) if you prefer the old command. Here 
are the three file formats that you need for the web:
»
» JPG: Use JPEG for photos. Remember to resize 
the photo so that it fits on a web page. When 
selecting a Quality setting, you need to balance 
image appearance with file size. A smaller file 
downloads (and displays in a web browser) faster, 
but a larger file generally looks better. If you 
reduce the Quality setting until just before the 
image doesn’t look great, you’ve hit the sweet 
spot — the compromise between file size and 
image quality.
»
» GIF: GIF is more appropriate for items like web 
banners and buttons (such as those shown in 
Figure 2-15) than it is for photos. If you save a 
photo that’s more than perhaps 100x100 pixels in 
size, you might see some degradation of the 
image quality as similar colors become one color. 
When you save an image as GIF, it can contain no 
FIGURE 2-15: 
Use GIF for web interface items.

34     PART 1  Getting Started with Photoshop CC
more than 256 distinct colors. JPEG and the other common file formats can 
have thousands of different colors.
»
» PNG: PNG comes in two types: PNG-8 (which is a substitute for GIF) and 
PNG-24 (which is a substitute for JPEG). PNG has a couple of advantages for 
web designers, such as support for transparency.
Formats for commercial printing
You’re the Photoshop master of your office. Everyone knows that you understand 
everything about digital images. So you’re the right person to create the com-
pany’s new brochure. Except you’re a photographer. Or you’re a web designer. Or 
you’re actually pretty new to Photoshop. And you don’t have a clue about prepar-
ing images for a commercial printing press.
Here’s what you need to know about file formats for those CMYK (cyan/magenta/
yellow/black) color images that you’re sending to the print shop:
»
» TIFF: TIFF is generally a solid choice. Use TIFF for photographic images that 
don’t contain any type layers.
»
» EPS: Choose EPS if your image has type. Don’t flatten or merge the type layers 
before using Save As to create the EPS. In the EPS Options dialog box, make 
sure to select the Include Vector Data check box to ensure that your type 
prints perfectly.
If you reopen an EPS file in Photoshop, your type layers get merged. Don’t! 
Instead, make sure to save your original file as PSD and, should you need to 
make changes, open the PSD and create a new EPS file when you’re done 
editing.
»
» PDF: PDF offers support for spot color channels, alpha channels, and paths — 
options not supported by EPS. (Spot channels are used with custom colors, and 
alpha channels store information about transparency in the image.) If your file 
uses any of these features, choose PDF over EPS, if your print shop accepts 
PDFs. When saving as PDF, the PDF Options dialog box offers Preserve 
Photoshop Editing Capabilities. If you select the option, the PDF file reopens 
in Photoshop with layers and editable type.
»
» PSD: Use PSD only if you’re adding the image file to a project in Adobe 
InDesign CC. Don’t send PSD files to a print shop unless specifically requested 
to do so by the print shop.

CHAPTER 2  Knowing Just Enough about Digital Images     35
Formats for PowerPoint and Word
If the final destination of your image is PowerPoint or Word, use the PNG file 
­format. If your image has areas of transparency in it, PNG is definitely the way 
to go. (Read about the two types of PNG files in the section “Formats for web 
graphics,” earlier in this chapter.)
What about all that neat clip art that you have on your hard drive? How do you use 
those images when Photoshop won’t open the vector-based WMF and EMF clip art 
files? Here’s how you get clip art into Photoshop, quick and easy:
1.	 Open a new document in Word (or a comparable word-processing 
program).
RESAVING IMAGES IN THE JPEG FORMAT
JPEG uses a lossy compression scheme: That is, as part of the compression process, it 
actually permanently throws away some data when you save your image. The lower the 
Quality setting, the more image degradation occurs. Take a look at the figure here. The 
original image is on the left. In the middle is the same image saved in JPEG format with 
medium quality and then on the right with low quality. Compare the insets on the eye-
lashes (400% zoom) for the left and right images. See what I mean by degradation? Look 
closely at the inset to the right and you can even see the 8 pixel by 8 pixel blocks used by 
JPEG during the compression process.
If you save by using JPEG a second time, even more data is thrown away. Every time you 
save, your image quality suffers. Yes, indeed, you might sometimes need to open a JPEG 
image, make some changes, and save as JPEG again (perhaps for the web, perhaps to 
share with non-Photoshop friends and family). To minimize damage to the image, either 
use the highest setting (12) for the Quality setting or (if you know it) the exact same 
­setting used last in Photoshop.

36     PART 1  Getting Started with Photoshop CC
2.	 Add the clip art.
In Word, choose Insert ➪ Picture ➪ Clip Art (or your word processor’s compa-
rable command). Click directly on the artwork and drag the lower-right corner 
to resize it to the dimensions that you need in Photoshop. (The artwork comes 
into Photoshop at 300 ppi.)
3.	 Choose Edit ➪ Copy.
The selected image is copied to the 
Clipboard (the computer’s mem-
ory) in Word.
4.	 Switch to your Photoshop image.
5.	 Choose Edit ➪ Paste.
You have your clip art, ready 
to use in Photoshop! Use the 
Edit ➪ Transform commands to 
scale, rotate, and otherwise fit 
the clip art into your design.

Taking the Chef ’s Tour of 
Your Photoshop Kitchen
I 
know you’re hungry to dive right in and start mixing up some masterpieces, but 
before you fire up the stove, look around the Photoshop kitchen. Get to know 
your spoons from your ladles, your pots from your pans, figure out how to turn 
on the blender . . . that sort of thing.
In this chapter, rather than going through all the Photoshop menus, panels, and 
tools (which would take several hundred very boring pages), I show you some 
basic operational concepts. (But don’t worry — you can read about how to use spe-
cific commands and tools throughout the book, in the chapters most ­appropriate 
for them.) Here you discover such things as how to spot which menu commands 
have dialog boxes, what the little symbol in the upper-right corner of a panel 
does, and which tools don’t use the Options bar. You also read about customizing 
your ­Photoshop environment for faster and more efficient work. Next I show you 
how to set up Photoshop’s Preferences and Color Settings. And to wrap up the 
­chapter — perhaps the most important section in this entire book — I explain 
what to do when Photoshop doesn’t seem to be working properly.

Food for Thought: How Things Work
A good understanding of certain fundamental operations and features in Photo-
shop provides you with the background that you need to follow the recipes or get 
creative and whip up some delicious artwork.
Don’t forget about Photoshop’s Tool Tips. If you don’t know what something or 
some option does, park your cursor over it for a couple of seconds, and Photoshop 
provides its information in a little box. Also, new to Photoshop are rich tool tips that 
include short videos of a specific tool in action. (If you find these distracting, open 
Photoshop’s Preferences and in the Tools section, deselect Use Rich Tool Tips.)
Ordering from the menus
When you’re working in Photoshop, you see a horizontal list of menus spread 
across the very top (Mac) or near the top (Windows) of the application window: 
File, Edit, Image, Layer, Type, Select, Filter, 3D, View, Window, and Help. On 
the Mac, the program also has a menu named Photoshop, just to the left of the 
File menu.
As with most programs, you click the name of a menu to reveal its commands. 
For both Mac and Windows, you can click and hold down the mouse button until 
you’re over the command you want; or you can click and release, move the cursor, 
and then click again. Some commands, such as Crop and Reveal All, are executed 
immediately after you choose them. When a command name in the menu is fol-
lowed by an ellipsis (. . .) — the Image Size command shown in Figure 3-1, for 
example — you know that a dialog box will open so that you can input variables 
and make decisions. A triangle to the right of a command name, such as that 
which you see next to Image Rotation, indicates a submenu. If you click the com-
mand name, another menu appears to the right. The cryptic set of symbols to the 
right of some commands (for example, Image Size) is the keyboard shortcut for 
opening the command’s dialog box. (I show you how to assign keyboard shortcuts 
later, in the section “Sugar and spice, shortcuts are nice.”)
If you’re working on a high resolution monitor in Windows and the ­Photoshop 
interface is too small to use efficiently, you can go to Photoshop’s ­Preferences ➪  
Interface and in the UI Scaling section select 200%, although the default Auto 
­setting seems to work well for most users.
As you read in the upcoming section “Clearing the table: Custom workspaces,” 
Photoshop menus are customizable — you don’t have to see commands that you 
never use. You can also color-code your menu commands, making it easier to spot 
those that you use regularly.

CHAPTER 3  Taking the Chef ’s Tour of Your Photoshop Kitchen     39
When a specific command appears grayed out in the menu (in gray type rather 
than black), that command isn’t available. Some commands, such as Reveal All 
in Figure 3-1, are available only under specific circumstances, such as when part 
of the image is being hidden with the Crop tool. When working with Photoshop’s 
creative filters, you’ll find that many aren’t available unless you’re working with 
an 8-bit RGB (red/green/blue) image. (Color modes and bit depth are discussed in 
Chapter 6; filters are explored in Chapter 15.)
Your platter full of panels
Photoshop, like the other programs of the Adobe Creative Cloud, uses floating 
panels. The panels, many of which you see along the right edge of your screen, 
usually appear on top of (float over) your image window. (As you drag panels 
around to customize your workspace, as described later in this section, you’ll find 
that panels can hide other panels.) The Options bar across the top of the work area 
and the Toolbox (technically, it’s called the Tools panel) along the left edge of the 
screen are also panels.
Panels contain Photoshop features that you might need to access so regularly that 
using a menu command is inconvenient. (I can’t imagine having to mouse to a 
menu command every time I want to change tools or select a specific layer!) You 
don’t always need to have your panels visible. In Photoshop, press the Tab key to 
hide all the panels or press Shift+Tab to hide all but the Toolbox and the Options 
bar. (Press Tab again to show the panels.) With fewer panels visible, you provide 
more room for your image. You can selectively hide and show panels via Photo-
shop’s Window menu.
FIGURE 3-1: 
Some ­commands 
have ­submenus, 
and some have 
dialog boxes.

40     PART 1  Getting Started with Photoshop CC
Photoshop uses expanding/collapsing panel docks. As shown to the right in 
Figure 3-2, clicking the double-arrow button at the top of a stack of panels collapses 
that stack to a tidy group of icons. The Color, Adjustments, and Layers panels 
are fully visible. The Swatches, Styles, Channels, and Paths panels — “nested” 
with the three visible panels  — can be made visible by clicking the panel tab. 
The collapsed History and Properties panels together occupy only a tiny fraction 
of the screen — those two buttons to the left of the Color panel. In Figure 3-2, 
the Application Frame (Mac only) is deselected in Photoshop’s Window menu, 
allowing the program to utilize the entire screen.
By clicking and dragging a panel’s tab when the panel isn’t collapsed, you can 
move it to another grouping or pull it out of its grouping and away from the edge 
of the screen. You might, for example, want to drag the Clone Source panel away 
from its buddies to make it more easily accessible while performing a complex 
clone operation. (The Clone Source panel is used with the Clone Stamp tool. You 
can specify up to five different source locations and easily switch among them.)
Many of the panels are resizable. Like an image window, you drag the lower-right 
corner of the panel to expand or contract it. Almost all the Photoshop panels have 
a panel menu from which you select various options. (The Toolbox and Options 
bar are the exceptions — they don’t have menus.) You open the panel menu by 
clicking the small button in the upper-right corner of the panel, as shown in 
Figure 3-3. The panel menu contains such options as thumbnail size (for exam-
ple, the Layers, Channels, and Paths panels); how to display items in the panel 
(Swatches, Styles, and Brush among others); or even the size and content of the 
panel (Info and Histogram).
FIGURE 3-2: 
Nesting and 
collapsing 
panels opens 
up the work 
area.

CHAPTER 3  Taking the Chef ’s Tour of Your Photoshop Kitchen     41
The content of some panels changes automatically as you work with your image. 
Add a layer, and the Layers panel shows a new layer. Save a selection, and the 
Channels panel shows a new alpha channel. If you create a vector shape, the Lay-
ers panel gets a new layer, and the Paths panel shows the layer’s vector path. 
You control some other panels by loading and deleting content through the panel 
menus or with the Edit ➪ Presets ➪ Preset Manager command. Use the Preset 
Manager (as shown in Figure 3-4) to save sets of your custom bits and pieces as 
well as to load and delete items from the panels.
As you can see in Figure 3-4, at long last you can now create groups (sets) of 
items in the Preset Manager panel. Take advantage of this feature to simplify the 
panel and easily access only the brushes you need for a particular task. The groups 
appear as expandable folders below the visible brushes. And your custom groups 
of brushes automatically appear in the Brush panel as well! (You may need to 
expand the Brush panel to make the brushes in the group visible.)

(Clicking the 
­double-arrow

­button

panel or panel 
group.)

42     PART 1  Getting Started with Photoshop CC
In addition to the content of the Brush, Swatches, Styles, and Tool Presets panels, 
you use the Preset Manager with a number of pickers. Pickers are sort of mini-
panels, available only with certain tools or features. The Gradient and Custom 
Shape pickers are accessed through the Options bar when those tools are in use. 
The Pattern picker is found in the Fill dialog box, in the Layer Style dialog box, 
and (with some tools) in the Options bar. The Contour picker is used with six of 
the effects in the Layer Style dialog box.
If Photoshop is an upgrade and if you have an earlier version of Photoshop on the 
same computer, you can pick up presets from earlier versions to save the time it 
would take to reload (or re-create) presets you use often. You can do so at any 
time by choosing Edit ➪ Presets ➪ Migrate Presets.
When you create custom layer styles, brushes, gradients, and the like, use the 
Preset Manager to protect your work. Create sets of the items and save those sets 
with the Preset Manager. Remember that new content of your panels is stored 
only in Photoshop’s Preferences file (introduced later in this chapter) until you 
create and save sets.
The tools of your trade
If you’re upgrading from an earlier version of Photoshop, you may notice the 
ellipse near the bottom of the Toolbox. Click that and you can customize the Tool-
box to optimize it for your workflow.
You control the behavior of Photoshop’s tools through the Options bar. With the 
exception of a few path-related tools (Add Anchor Point, Delete Anchor Point, and 
Convert Point), every tool in Photoshop has options. The Options bar changes as 
you switch tools. The behavior of some tools changes when you add one or more 
modifier keys (⌘  , Shift, and Option for the Mac; Ctrl, Shift, and Alt for Windows). 
As an example of how modifier keys can affect tool behavior, consider the Rectan-
gular Marquee and Elliptical Marquee tools:
»
» Hold down the Shift key while dragging. Normally the marquee selection 
tools are freeform — you drag however you like. When you hold down the 
Shift key while dragging, on the other hand, you constrain the proportions of 
the selection to a square or circle (rather than a rectangle or ellipse).
»
» Hold down the Option/Alt key while dragging. When you hold down the 
Option/Alt key while dragging a marquee selection tool, the selection is 
centered on the point where you first clicked. Rather than being a corner of a 
selection, that starting point is the center of the selection.

CHAPTER 3  Taking the Chef ’s Tour of Your Photoshop Kitchen     43
»
» Hold down the Shift and Option/Alt keys while dragging. You can select 
from the center while constraining proportions by using the Shift and Option/
Alt keys together.
»
» Use the Shift key to add to an existing selection. If you already have an 
active selection in your image, Shift+dragging a selection tool adds to that 
selection. (Press Shift before you click and drag.)
»
» Use the Option/Alt key to subtract from an 
existing selection. When you have an existing 
selection and you hold down the Option/Alt key, 
you can drag to subtract from the selection. Note 
in Figure 3-5 that the selection tool’s cursor 
shows a small minus sign when subtracting from 
a selection.
»
» “Double-clutch” with the Shift or Option/Alt 
key. You can even constrain proportions or 
select from the center and add to or subtract 
from a selection. Press the Shift key (to add to 
the existing selection) or the Option/Alt key (to 
subtract from the existing selection). Click and start dragging the marquee 
selection tool. While continuing to hold down the mouse button, release the 
modifier key and press and hold Shift (to constrain proportions), Option/Alt (to 
center the selection), or both; then continue to drag your selection tool. You 
might want to use this technique, for example, when creating a donut-shaped 
selection. Drag the initial circular selection and then subtract a smaller circular 
selection from the center of the initial circle.
Don’t be afraid to experiment with modifier keys while working with tools. After 
all, you always have the Undo command (⌘  +Z/Ctrl+Z) at hand!
If you’re using a current version of Windows, you also have Microsoft Dial Support 
available, which enables you to adjust brush attributes using the Microsoft Dial 
(if it’s on your hardware).
Get Cookin’ with Customization
Customizing Photoshop not only helps you work faster and more efficiently, but 
it can also help you work more precisely and prevent tragic errors. Consider using 
a Crop tool preset to create a 5x7 print at 300 pixels per inch (ppi). Such a preset 
will always produce exactly those dimensions, every single time. Setting up the 
Crop tool each time you need a 5x7 at 300 ppi doesn’t just waste time: It also opens 
FIGURE 3-5: 
Use the Option/Alt key with a 
selection tool to subtract from a 
selection.

44     PART 1  Getting Started with Photoshop CC
the door for time-consuming or project-wrecking typos. (“Oops! I guess I made a 
mistake — this image is 5x7 at only 30 pixels per inch!”)
Clearing the table: Custom workspaces
One of the easiest ways to work more efficiently is to see your image better. 
­Generally speaking, bigger is better, so the more room you have on the monitor 
to display your artwork, the better you can zoom in and do precise work. As men-
tioned earlier, the easiest way to gain workspace is to press the Tab key to hide 
Photoshop’s panels. Pressing Shift+Tab hides all the panels except the Options bar 
and the Toolbox.
Keep in mind that it’s best to use 100% zoom when evaluating your image for 
banding (areas of similar color that should blend smoothly, but don’t) or moiré 
(which can occur when scanning printed material — see Figure 4-3 in the follow-
ing chapter for an example) and when applying filters. Any other zoom factor is a 
simulation of the image’s appearance. If you have a computer and video card that 
support OpenCL drawing (take a look in Photoshop’s Preferences ➪ Performance, 
activate Use Graphics Processor and click the Advanced Settings), you have much 
better on-screen display. But 100% zoom is safest when making critical decisions.
You can also drag the panels that you need regularly to a custom group of ­panels. 
To move a panel, drag it by the tab and “nest” it with other panels. And don’t 
forget that the major panels have keyboard shortcuts assigned to show and hide. 
Although keyboard shortcuts are customizable (as you can read later in this 
­chapter), here are the primary panels’ assigned F keys, the function keys that 
appear at the top of your keyboard:
»
» Actions: Option/Alt+F9
»
» Brush: F5
»
» Color: F6
»
» Info: F8
»
» Layers: F7
Any panels nested with the panel that you show/hide are also shown and ­hidden. 
And don’t forget that you can always restore all panels to their default loca-
tions by choosing Window ➪ Workspace ➪ Essentials (Default) from Photoshop’s 
main menu. If the default workspace is already selected, choose Window ➪  
Workspace ➪ Reset Essentials to get back to the default panel layout.

CHAPTER 3  Taking the Chef ’s Tour of Your Photoshop Kitchen     45
The most efficient way to customize your work area is to create and save special-
ized workspaces. Arrange the panels exactly as you need them for a particular job 
you do regularly, choose Window ➪ Workspace ➪ New Workspace (in the Window 
menu, visible panels are indicated with a checkmark), and name the workspace 
for that type of job. Then you can make a specialized workspace for each type of 
work you do. For example, perhaps when you do color correction, you need to see 
the Histogram panel (in the expanded view), the Info panel, and the Channels 
panel. Arrange those panels how you need them and then hide the rest, saving the 
workspace named as Color Correction. Or, perhaps when you create illustrations in 
Photoshop, you need to see the Layers and Paths panels at the same time. Drag 
one out of the group to separate it, position them both where convenient, and save 
the workspace as Illustration.
To access a saved workspace, choose Window ➪ Workspace and select it from the 
list at the top of the menu, as shown in Figure  3-6. You can see some preset 
­custom workspaces in the middle section of the menu, as well.
You can also save the current state of the customizable keyboard shortcuts and 
menus in your workspace. Although streamlining the menus for the specific work 
you’re doing is a great idea, it’s probably not such a great idea to have more than 
one set of custom keyboard shortcuts. The time it takes to remember which short-
cuts go with the current workspace (or to undo a mistake caused by the wrong 
shortcut) is time wasted.
To customize Photoshop’s menus, choose Edit ➪ Menus, which opens the Key-
board Shortcuts and Menus dialog box. (Alternatively, choose Edit ➪ Keyboard  
Shortcuts and click the Menus tab.) Here you can find every available menu 
­command listed. (Filters available in the Filter Gallery cannot have individual key-
board shortcuts unless, in Photoshop’s Preferences ➪ Plug-Ins, you have elected 
FIGURE 3-6: 
Select a 
workspace 
from the menu 
to instantly 
rearrange your 
panels.

46     PART 1  Getting Started with Photoshop CC
to list all filters on the Filter menu.) You also have the option of hiding a command 
or assigning a custom color to make it easier to identify in the menu. You might, 
for example, hide the blur filters that you never use, and color-code the others 
according to how you like or use them. (See Figure 3-7.)
In addition to the application menu commands (from the menus at the top of the 
screen), you can switch the Menu For pop-up to Panel menus and customize those 
menus, too. Don’t forget to save your customized menu arrangements with the 
button directly to the right of the Settings pop-up. Your saved menu set appears 
in that Settings pop-up for easy access. Keep in mind, too, that while customizing 
shortcuts, you can drag the lower-right corner of the window to expand it, mak-
ing it easier to find specific items for which you want to assign shortcuts.
Sugar and spice, shortcuts are nice
The Photoshop keyboard shortcuts can save a bunch of time. Rather than moving 
the cursor to the Toolbox to select the Brush tool, just press the B key. To open the 
Levels dialog box, press ⌘  +L/Ctrl+L instead of going to the Image menu, down to 
the Adjustments submenu, and then over and down to Levels.
Photoshop has customizable keyboard shortcuts. Because the default set of 
shortcuts is pretty standard  — not only throughout the Adobe Creative Cloud 
but also with other major programs — you’re probably best served by making 
only a few changes. Open the Keyboard Shortcuts and Menus dialog box (shown 
FIGURE 3-7: 
You can 
hide menu 
commands 
and color-code 
the visible 
commands.

CHAPTER 3  Taking the Chef ’s Tour of Your Photoshop Kitchen     47
in Figure 3-8) through the Edit menu to make one major change and then any 
changes for personal preferences. Change ⌘  +Z/Ctrl+Z to use Step Backward. In 
most programs, pressing ⌘  +Z/Ctrl+Z keeps undoing — reverting through a series 
of previous actions in the program. In Photoshop, however, that shortcut toggles 
an Undo/Redo function; that is, press once to undo and press a second time to 
reverse the undo. Bah! Make Photoshop conform to the undo-undo-undo behav-
ior common to other programs. In Keyboard Shortcuts, under Edit, change ⌘  +Z/
Ctrl+Z to Step Backward and then use ⌘  +Option+Z/Ctrl+Alt+Z to toggle between 
Undo and Redo.
There has been one major change to shortcuts: ⌘  +F/Ctrl+F no longer applies the 
previous filter, but rather opens the Search dialog box. Apply the previous filter 
with ⌘  +Option+F/Ctrl+Alt+F.
Spoons can’t chop: Creating tool presets
One of the keys to efficient, accurate work in Photoshop is using the right tool for 
the job. For example, the Patch tool with Normal active in the Options bar (the 
default) copies texture only. If you need to cover a spot on a client’s face, changing 
both texture and color, you may need the Clone Stamp tool or the Patch tool with 
the Content-Aware option. (You can read about how the tools work throughout 
this book.)
You can ensure that you’re using not only the correct tool but also the correct 
settings for that tool by creating tool presets, which store your settings from the 
Options bar. You can then select the preset tool (and, of course, that’s where 
the catchy name comes from) from the Tool Presets panel or from the left end of 
the Options bar, as shown in Figure 3-9.
FIGURE 3-8: 
Assign custom 
keyboard 
shortcuts to 
speed your 
work.

48     PART 1  Getting Started with Photoshop CC
Although just about any tool is a good candidate for tool presets, some are just 
plain naturals. Consider, if you will, the Crop tool. As I explain in Chapter 4, a 
photo from a high-end digital camera has an aspect ratio (relationship between 
width and height of the image) of 2:3, and common print and frame aspect ratios 
include 4:5 for 8x10 prints, 5:7, and 13:19 for large prints. (Some digital cameras 
shoot in different aspect ratios.) You’ll often find a need to crop an image to a 
specific size to meet your printing requirements. And, don’t forget resolution — 
printing in the correct size at the wrong resolution is simply a waste of paper and 
ink! Set up a number of Crop tool presets for your typical print sizes and relax, 
knowing that you’ll always be cropping correctly.
Another logical candidate for tool presets is the Type tool. When you consider all 
the options for the Type tool in not only the Options bar but also in the Character 
and Paragraph panels, you have quite a bit to select and track. To ensure consis-
tent text from project to project, consider creating tool presets for each project, 
including (as appropriate) headline and body text, special effects and accent type, 
and even your copyright information. Keep in mind, too, that you can use Type 
tool presets in conjunction with the Character Styles and Paragraph Styles panels 
(which are discussed in Chapter 13).
Using the Preset Manager (opened through the Edit ➪ Presets menu), you can drag 
the tools presets up and down to rearrange them. Sort them in a logical order or 
move the presets you use most often to the top of the panel. The changes are for 
both the Tool Presets panel and the picker at the left end of the Options bar.
Season to Taste: The Photoshop Settings
The program-level Preferences and the Color Settings flavor all your work in 
­Photoshop. The options that you choose in Photoshop’s Preferences (or simply 
the Prefs) control many facets of the program’s basic behavior. Choices made in 
the Color Settings dialog box determine how your work looks, both on-screen and 
in print. And when you get down to brass tacks, that’s what it’s all about — the 
appearance of your artwork.
FIGURE 3-9:

and more 
­accurately.

CHAPTER 3  Taking the Chef ’s Tour of Your Photoshop Kitchen     49
Standing orders: Setting the Preferences
Photoshop’s Preferences file stores a whole lot of information about how you use 
the program. Whether you prefer to measure in inches or pixels, how you like the 
grid and guides displayed, what size thumbnails you prefer in your panels, which 
font you used last — all sorts of data is maintained in the Prefs. Much of the info 
in the Preferences is picked up automatically as you work (such as the size and 
color mode of the last new document you created, whether the Character panel 
was visible when you last shut down the program, and which tool options were 
selected in the Options bar), but you must actively select a number of options in 
the Preferences dialog box, as shown in Figure 3-10.
Many of Photoshop’s handy reminder messages include a Don’t Show Again 
option. If you someday decide that you do indeed need to start seeing one or more 
of those reminders again, open the Preferences and click the Resent All Warning 
Dialogs button at the bottom of the General pane.
Your custom styles, brushes, Actions, and the like are recorded only in Photo-
shop’s Preferences until you actually save them to your hard drive. That makes 
them vulnerable to accidental loss. Use the Actions panel menu command Save 
Action to save sets of Actions (not individual Actions) and use the Preset Manager 
(under the Edit ➪ Presets menu) to save sets of your other bits and pieces. And 
make sure to save them in a safe location outside the Photoshop folder — you 
wouldn’t want to accidentally delete your custom items if you should ever have to 
(oh, no!) reinstall Photoshop, would you?
Open the Preferences on a Mac with the keyboard shortcut ⌘  +K or choose 
­Photoshop ➪ Preferences to select one of the 17 specific subsets of Preferences to 
change. The shortcut for Windows users is Ctrl+K, and the Preferences submenu is 
under the Edit menu. The default settings are perfectly acceptable (after all, they 
FIGURE 3-10: 
Use ­Photoshop’s 
Preferences

many program 
­behaviors.

50     PART 1  Getting Started with Photoshop CC
are the defaults for a reason), but the following sections cover some changes to 
the Preferences to consider, listed by the section of the Preferences dialog box in 
which you find them.
Some of the changes you make in Photoshop’s Preferences are applied as soon as 
you click OK. Other changes don’t take effect until you restart the program. (You’ll 
get a reminder about that.)
Preferences ➪ History Log
The History Log maintains a record of what you’ve done to a specific image. You 
can record when you opened and saved a file with the Sessions option, see a sum-
mary of what you did with the Concise option, or keep track of every command, 
every feature, and every setting you used with the Detailed option! And the log can 
be recorded to a text file or stored in an image’s metadata for retrieval by choos-
ing File ➪ File Info.
Preferences ➪ Tools
One option not selected by default that you may find very handy is Zoom Clicked 
Point to Center. When you click with the Zoom tool, this option automatically 
centers the view on the point where you clicked.
When using the transform commands, Photoshop shows you numerically 
­precisely what you’re doing. A small display shows the new dimensions (when 
scaling) or the angle (when rotating or shearing). You may find that to the upper 
right of the cursor isn’t a good location (perhaps while using the stylus in your 
right hand on a Wacom Cintiq tablet). Change the location — or select Never to 
hide the info completely.
If you’re working with a machine that offers Gestures (pinching to zoom, 
three-finger swipe, and so on) and you like using Gestures, you can use them in 
Photoshop.
Preferences ➪ Interface and Preferences ➪ Workspace
The Interface and Workspace panels of the Preferences offers several options 
of note:
»
» Appearance: You may find that Photoshop’s “dark interface” is not to your 
taste. (Try it for a while — it’ll likely grow on you.) You can select from among 
two lighter (and one even darker) interface appearances.

CHAPTER 3  Taking the Chef ’s Tour of Your Photoshop Kitchen     51
»
» Screen Modes: You can easily customize the look of Photoshop’s three screen 
modes.
»
» UI Font Size: If you find yourself squinting to read panel names and such, change 
the UI Font Size to Large and restart Photoshop. If you still have problems reading 
the screen, reduce the monitor’s resolution. (See Chapter 2 for details.)
»
» Show Channels in Color: When only one channel is active in the Channels 
panel, it normally shows a grayscale representation of the image. If you prefer 
to have the active channel appear in its own color, select this option. Keep in 
mind, however, that after you get comfortable working with individual 
channels, the default grayscale is easier to see.
»
» Show Menu Colors: As I discuss earlier in this chapter, you can assign colors 
to specific commands in the Photoshop menus. That might make it easier for 
you to quickly spot and select often-used commands. Use this option to 
disable the color coding without having to deselect each assigned color.
»
» Auto-Collapse Iconic Panels: If you prefer an uncluttered workplace, here’s a 
great option for you! When selected, panels in icon mode (click the upper bar 
of a group of panels) collapse to buttons. To open a panel, click its button. 
When Auto-Collapse is selected, the selected panel automatically closes when 
you click elsewhere in Photoshop. If you need to keep a specific panel open 
while you work (perhaps Histogram or Info), drag it out of its group and away 
from the edge of the screen, and it will stay open until you close it.
»
» Auto-Show Hidden Panels: Position the cursor over a collapsed panel and it 
springs open.
»
» Open Documents as Tabs: Photoshop, by default, opens each document as a 
tab across the top of the work area. You click a tab to bring that image to the 
front. If you find that you’re constantly dragging tabs off to create floating 
windows, deselect this option in the Preferences. And if you disable tabbed 
image windows, you’ll likely also want to disable the Enable Floating 
Document Window Docking option. This prevents image windows from 
docking as you drag them around on-screen.
Preferences ➪ File Handling
Image previews add a little to the file size, but in most cases, you want to include 
the preview. On Macs, you have the option of including a file extension or not (or 
having Photoshop ask you each and every time). Even if you don’t plan on sharing 
files with a Windows machine, I strongly recommend that you always include the 
file extension in the filename by selecting the Always option. Likewise, I suggest 
that you always maximize PSD and PSB file compatibility. This ensures that your 
Photoshop files can be opened (with as many features intact as possible) in earlier 
versions of the program and that they’ll function properly with other programs in 

52     PART 1  Getting Started with Photoshop CC
the Creative Cloud. Maximizing compatibility can be critical if you also work with 
Adobe’s Lightroom CC.
Photoshop includes an auto-recovery feature, one that doesn’t compromise the 
creative process. If, as with some programs, your open file was simply saved to 
your hard drive at specific intervals, overwriting the original, your artistic experi-
mentation could be limited to that specified time frame. Say, for example, that you 
tried a specific artistic filter, took an important phone call, and later found out 
that the program had rewritten the file on your hard drive and that experimental 
filter has become a permanent part of your artwork. But you decided you don’t like 
it after all. Bummer! (Or simply Undo, of course.) Rather than taking such risks 
with your creativity, Photoshop now can save recovery information, which doesn’t 
affect the original file in any way, at intervals specified in the Preferences. Or you 
can disable the feature by deselecting the check box.
Preferences ➪ Performance
The Performance panel contains options related to how Photoshop runs on your 
computer:
»
» Memory Usage: Try bumping the memory allocation to 100%. If things seem 
slower rather than faster, back off the memory allocation to perhaps 85%. In a 
64-bit environment, Photoshop can take advantage of all the RAM you can 
cram (into the computer).
»
» History States: This field determines how many entries (up to 1,000) appear in 
the History panel. Storing more history states provides more flexibility, but at a 
cost — storing too many history states uses up all your available memory and 
slows Photoshop to a crawl. Generally speaking, 20 or 30 is a good number. If, 
however, you do a lot of operations that use what I call “little clicks,” such as 
painting or dodging/burning with short strokes, that History panel fills quickly. 
For such operations, a setting of perhaps 50 or even 60 is more appropriate.
»
» Cache Levels: The image cache stores low-resolution copies of your image to 
speed on-screen display at various zoom levels. Although this process speeds 
up screen redraw, the price is accuracy. Unless your video card has trouble 
driving your monitor at your selected resolution and color depth, you might 
be better served by Cache Levels: 1. That gives the most accurate picture of 
your work. (But remember to make critical decisions at 100% zoom, where 
one image pixel equals one screen pixel.)
»
» Graphics Processor Settings: This area displays information about your 
computer’s video card. If your system has the capability, you’ll see a check box 
for Use Graphics Processor. This provides smoother, more accurate views at 
all zoom levels and other enhancements, including the capability to rotate the 
image on-screen — not rotate the canvas, but rotate just the on-screen image. 
And that’s too cool for words when painting a complex layer mask!

CHAPTER 3  Taking the Chef ’s Tour of Your Photoshop Kitchen     53
Preferences ➪ Scratch Disks
Photoshop’s scratch disks are hard drive space used to support the memory. Use 
only internal hard drives as scratch disks — never an external drive, a network 
drive, or removable media! If you have multiple internal hard drives, consider a 
dedicated partition (perhaps 15–50GB) on the second drive — not the drive on 
which the operating system is installed. Name the partition Scratch and use it 
exclusively as a scratch disk for Photoshop (and perhaps Adobe Illustrator). If 
you have a couple of extra internal drives, each can have a scratch partition. (On 
a Windows computer, you might see a message warning you that the scratch disk 
and the Windows paging file, which serves the same basic purpose at the system 
level, are on the same drive. If you have only one internal hard drive, ignore the 
message.) To re-order the scratch disks, click the scratch disk in the list and then, 
rather than dragging, use the arrows keys to the right.
Preferences ➪ Cursors
Photoshop offers you a couple of ways to display cursors for painting tools. You 
can show the tool icon (Standard), a small crosshair (Precise), or a representa-
tion of the tool’s brush tip, indicating the size and shape of the brush (Brush 
Size). With soft-edged brushes, the brush size cursor shows where the tool will 
be applied at 50% strength or higher. Alternatively, select the Full Size Brush 
Tip option, which always shows the full extent of the brush tip, regardless of the 
Hardness setting.
You also have the option of adding 
a crosshair in the middle of either 
brush-size 
cursor. 
The 
crosshair 
option is great for keeping a brush 
centered along an edge or path, and it 
just about eliminates the need for the 
Precise cursor option. As you can see 
in Figure  3-11 when working with a 
soft brush, showing all the pixels that 
are changed even a little (to the right) 
might not give you an accurate view 
of your work. (The Normal Brush Tip 
cursor is shown at the top center and the Show Crosshair in Brush Tip option can 
be seen at the lower left.)
When the Show Only Crosshair While Painting option is selected in Preferences, the 
brush cursor appears at the selected diameter display (Full Size or Normal) until 
you press the mouse button (or press the stylus to the tablet). It then automati-
cally switches to the crosshair and remains as a precise cursor until you release 
the mouse button (or lift the stylus). Experienced brush-tool-using Photoshop-
pers might want to experiment with this option — if you know the diameter, you 
FIGURE 3-11: 
When working with a low Hardness setting, 
Normal Brush Tip is usually best.

54     PART 1  Getting Started with Photoshop CC
might want to better focus on the center of the brush when you are, for example, 
painting or dodging or burning along a distinct edge.
When you’re sure that you have a brush-size cursor selected in the Preferences 
but Photoshop shows you the precise cursor, check the Caps Lock key. Pressing 
Caps Lock toggles the painting cursors between Precise and Brush Size.
Also found in the Cursors panel is the Brush Preview color. Click the color swatch 
to open the Color Picker and assign a color to use when dynamically resizing your 
brushes. (If you don’t have OpenCL drawing capability, the brushes can still be 
resized, but the color preview will not be visible.) With a brush-using tool active, 
press and hold down the Option+Control keys on a Mac and drag left or right; on a 
Windows machine, Alt-right-click and drag left or right to resize the brush — on 
the fly! Want to change the brush hardness? Hold down those same keys and drag 
up or down rather than left or right.
Preferences ➪ Transparency & Gamut
If you work in grayscale regularly, you might want to change the color of the 
transparency grid to something that contrasts with your image; perhaps pale blue 
and pale yellow. If you find the gray-and-white checkerboard pattern distracting 
in images with transparency, you can set Grid Size to None, which gives you a 
plain white background in transparent areas of your artwork.
Preferences ➪ Units & Rulers
If you create web graphics rather than print images, you probably want to change 
the unit of measure from Inches to Pixels. Keep in mind that you can change the 
unit of measure on the fly by right-clicking the rulers in your image (which you 
show and hide with the shortcut ⌘  +R/Ctrl+R). If you regularly print at a resolu-
tion other than 300 ppi, you might also want to adjust the default resolution for 
print-size new documents.
Preferences ➪ Guides, Grid & Slices
Photoshop offers Smart Guides, which appear and disappear automatically as 
you drag the content of one layer into and out of alignment with the content of 
other layers. Smart Guides (magenta 
in color by default) show when the 
content of the layer you’re dragging 
aligns perfectly with the edges or 
center of other layers’ content. See 
Figure 3-12. (Show/hide Smart Guides 
through the View ➪ Show menu. They 
are active by default now.)
FIGURE 3-12: 
The magenta guides show how the layer aligns 
with other layers.

CHAPTER 3  Taking the Chef ’s Tour of Your Photoshop Kitchen     55
Preferences ➪ Plug-Ins
Extensions are panels created outside of the Adobe Photoshop development pro-
cess that you can download or purchase. Allowing them to connect to the Internet 
to search for new content may or may not be a good idea, depending on your level 
of network security. I’m not suggesting that a panel could steal your passwords or 
anything like that, but unless you trust the source of the panel . . .
The creative filters of the Filter Gallery are not listed individually in the Filter 
menu. You open the Filter Gallery, and then select the filter you need. If you would 
rather have the Filter Gallery open directly to the filter you need, select Show All 
Filter Gallery Groups and Names option and restart Photoshop.
Preferences ➪ Technology Previews
One of the several new Preferences panes is Technology Preview. Depending on 
which platform you use, your choices vary. Take a couple of moments (when you 
have time) to click the Learn More button to find out what the new technologies 
are all about.
Photoshop’s Preferences menu also provides you with direct access to the Camera 
Raw plug-in’s Preferences. In Camera Raw’s Preferences you can, among other 
things, determine whether JPEG and TIFF files open into Camera Raw. (Camera 
Raw is discussed in Chapter 7.)
Ensuring consistency: Color Settings
If one term strikes fear deep in the heart of a typical Photoshop user, it’s color 
management. Few aspects of the program are so misunderstood. Yet without wise 
color management decisions, your images won’t print accurately. For most Pho-
toshop users, color management can be implemented with a few key choices in 
the Edit ➪ Color Settings dialog box (shown in Figure 3-13), which can then be 
saved for future use:
»
» Select an RGB working space. Open the Color Settings dialog box (under the 
Edit menu) and select your RGB working space, the color space in which you 
edit and create. If you primarily create web graphics, shoot in the JPEG format, 
send your images to a photo lab for printing, or print with an inkjet printer 
that uses only four ink colors (cyan, magenta, yellow, and black), choose sRGB 
as your color space. If you shoot Raw and print to an inkjet printer that uses 
six or more inks, or if you prepare artwork that will be converted to a CMYK 
color space, choose Adobe RGB. (If you have hardware and software to create 
a custom profile for your computer’s monitor, use that profile at the system 
level so that it’s available to all programs.)

56     PART 1  Getting Started with Photoshop CC
»
» Elect to convert images to your working space. In the Color Management 
Policies area of the Color Settings dialog box, choose RGB: Convert to Working 
RGB. This ensures that the images you see onscreen actually use your working 
profile.
»
» Turn off the mismatch warnings. Clear the check boxes for those annoying 
and time-wasting warnings that pop up on-screen any time you open an 
image with a profile other than your working space. You’re intentionally 
converting to your working space — you don’t need to reaffirm the decision 
every time.
»
» CMYK and Grayscale settings: CMYK (cyan/magenta/yellow/black) color 
mode is used exclusively with images intended for output on commercial 
printing presses and some color laser printers. (Don’t be fooled by the inks 
you purchase for your inkjet printer — the printer’s driver expects to convert 
from RGB, so sending CMYK color to an inkjet will produce substandard 
output.) Likewise, you’ll use Grayscale very rarely. If, in fact, you have an inkjet 
printer that is capable of printing grayscale (such as the magnificent Epson 
Stylus Pro 7900), you may still want to have an RGB image and let the printer’s 
print driver handle the grayscale conversion. If, however, you are preparing an 
image for output on a commercial press (in CMYK or Grayscale color mode), 
speak directly with the person who will place the image into the page layout 
or with the print shop to find out what settings to use for that particular job.
The preceding guidelines are appropriate for most, but not all, Photoshop users. 
You might fall into a special category. If you exclusively create web graphics, set 
the RGB color management policy to Off. In the Save for Web & Devices dialog 
box, when saving images in the JPEG file format, don’t embed ICC profiles. (ICC 
profiles make specific adjustments to the appearance of your images to compen-
sate for vagaries of the hardware. I discuss color profiles in Chapter 4.) When you 
eliminate color profiles from the equation, you’re creating web graphics that any

Settings dialog 
box for optimal 
printing.

web browser can show properly (or, more accurately, “as properly as the viewer’s 
uncalibrated monitor can display”).
When it’s time to print, you’ll get the most accurate and pleasing color prints 
when you let Photoshop (rather than the printer) control color. In the Print dia-
log box’s Options area, choose Color Handling: Photoshop Manages Colors and 
select the printer’s own profile for the specific paper on which you’re printing as 
the Printer Profile. Use Relative Colorimetric as the rending intent and leave the 
Black Point Compensation check box selected. (Note: If your prints are too dark, 
try deselecting Black Point Compensation.) Click the Print Settings button to open 
the printer’s own options. Make sure to deactivate the printer’s built-in color 
management and select the same paper you chose to the right in Photoshop’s 
Print dialog box.
If you send your image files to an outside source for prints, they will likely require 
JPEG files using the sRGB color profile. Check the company’s website (or give 
them a call) and see if, instead, you can send TIFF files in Adobe RGB. That avoids 
the image degradation produced by JPEG’s compression and extends the color 
range for the images.
If color in your images needs to be absolutely perfect because merely accurate 
won’t do, consider purchasing hardware and software to calibrate and profile 
all the devices in your workflow. X-Rite (www.xrite.com), Datacolor (www.
datacolor.com), and PANTONE (www.pantone.com) are three sources to explore.
When Good Programs Go Bad: 
Fixing Photoshop
Sometimes things happen. Bad things. Tools don’t work right. Simple commands 
take ages to execute. Photoshop (gasp!) crashes! Don’t give up, and please don’t 
toss the machine through the window. (Hey, I might be walking past at the time.) 
Start with the easy fixes and work your way up as necessary:
»
» Check the panels and selection. If a tool isn’t working as expected or isn’t 
working at all, check whether you’re inadvertently preventing it from doing its 
job. See whether you have an active selection elsewhere in the image or press 
⌘  +D/Ctrl+D to deselect. Look at the Layers panel: Are you working on the 
correct layer? Is the layer itself active or a layer mask? Is there no higher layer 
hiding the area in which you’re trying to work? Check the Channels panel: Are 
the color channels active? At the left end of the Options bar, right-click the  
tool icon and select Reset Tool. Open a flattened 8-bit RGB image and try the  

58     PART 1  Getting Started with Photoshop CC
tool or technique in that image. If it works there, the problem isn’t Photoshop 
but rather the specific image. Check the Image ➪ Mode menu to ensure that 
you have an appropriate color mode and bit depth.
»
» Reset Photoshop’s Preferences file to the defaults. Before replacing the 
Preferences, open Photoshop’s Preset Manager (through the Edit ➪ Presets 
menu) and save any custom styles, gradients, brushes, and so forth. Save 
them in a safe place, outside the Photoshop folder. Open the Actions panel 
and save any sets of custom Actions with the panel menu Save Actions 
command. (Remember that you must click a set of Actions — not an individual 
Action — to use Save Actions.) Open the Preferences and Color Settings and 
make notes about any special settings you’re using. Quit Photoshop and 
restart the program with the ⌘  +Option+Shift keys pressed (Mac); or in 
Windows, position your fingers over the Ctrl+Alt+Shift keys, and immediately 
after launching the program (not before), press and hold down the three keys. 
When asked whether you want to delete the Settings file, release the modifier 
keys and confirm the deletion; allow Photoshop to finish starting. Reset your 
Preferences and Color Settings and reload your custom bits and pieces.
»
» Reinstall Photoshop. If replacing the Preferences doesn’t solve the problem, 
try reinstalling Photoshop. Save all your custom items (as described earlier) 
and then uninstall Photoshop. Open the Photoshop folder and use the 
Uninstall Adobe Photoshop command. After uninstalling, restart your 
computer (not always necessary, but a good practice) and reinstall.
If reinstalling Photoshop doesn’t solve the problem, the source might be at 
the  operating system level or is perhaps a hardware problem. Call in the big 
guns by contacting Adobe tech support at https://helpx.adobe.com/contact/
support.html.

Getting Images into 
and out of Photoshop
I
n this chapter, I show you how to get images into Photoshop from your digital 
camera and your scanner and then how to keep those images organized on your 
hard drives and discs. I discuss the basics of printing your images on inkjet 
printers (and alternatives) and tell you some things you need to know to make 
sure that you get the prints you expect. I also explain how to prepare images for 
sending by e-mail.
Bringing Images into Photoshop
Artwork in Photoshop originates in one of three ways:
»
» You open an image using Photoshop’s File ➪ Open dialog box (as shown in 
Figure 4-1) or through Bridge (discussed later in this chapter). In Figure 4-1, 
note that Windows does not provide previews or thumbnails of PSD files (or 
many Raw formats), which is one of the reasons you have Bridge CC available.
»
» You import an image (typically through a scanning device).
»
» You create an image from scratch by choosing File ➪ New.

60     PART 1  Getting Started with Photoshop CC
If you double-click a file and Photoshop doesn’t launch or the wrong program 
launches, you need to either launch Photoshop manually and use the File ➪ Open 
command or associate the file format with Photoshop. (Check your operating sys-
tem’s Help for info on associating file types with specific programs.) If you open 
images through Bridge:
1.	 Open Bridge’s Preferences with the shortcut ⌘  +K/Ctrl+K.
2.	 In the column to the left, click File Type Associations.
3.	 In the lower-right corner, click the Reset to Default Associations button.
If you double-click a file and Photoshop launches but the image doesn’t open, 
you’ve likely made a change to the operating system and should reinstall Pho-
toshop (remembering to disable all spyware/antivirus software before installing 
and, of course, reactivating afterward).
Downloading from your digital camera
If you have the hardware, you can remove your camera’s memory card, mem-
ory stick, or other media from the camera and insert it into a slot right on your 
­computer. You can also use a card reader, which is a small device designed to 
FIGURE 4-1: 
Windows 
on the right, 
Mac to the 
upper-left.

CHAPTER 4  Getting Images into and out of Photoshop     61
read camera storage media. Transferring via the Mac Finder or Windows is often 
faster than (and usually just as reliable as) transferring using the camera manu-
facturer’s software.
Never open an image into Photoshop directly from a camera, Flash card, or CD/
DVD. Doing so can slow down your work, and you also risk losing your work if 
Photoshop isn’t able to immediately and efficiently read the original file while 
you work. And, of course, you can’t save from Photoshop back to most removable 
media, so you need to create a new file (on a writable drive) anyway. Open images 
from a network drive only when working with Adobe Drive, the digital asset man-
agement (DAM) program that you can download (for free) from Adobe.com.
After the images are safely stored on your local hard drive (or a high-speed exter-
nal hard drive), you can open them in Photoshop by using one of the methods that 
I describe earlier in the chapter. Depending on your color settings, you might see 
a warning that the image’s color profile and the profile that you selected as your 
RGB working space don’t match. You may see a simple OK/Cancel option or you’ll 
see the embedded profile and the working profile, and you’re given three options 
(as well as a Cancel button, which won’t open the document):
»
» Use the embedded profile (instead of the working space)
»
» Convert the document’s colors to the working space
»
» Discard the embedded profile (don’t color manage)
Generally speaking, you want to convert to your working space so that you see the 
most accurate color on your monitor. You might want to preserve the embedded 
profile if you’ll be returning the image to the originating computer after looking 
at or working on it. The third option disregards all color profiles and works with 
uncorrected color. This is a good choice when working with images that you’ll 
later use with a non-color-managed program, such as a web browser or presenta-
tion program. (Without color management, you see the image as it will appear in 
the other program.) You can disable the color mismatch warnings in Photoshop’s 
Edit ➪ Color Settings dialog box.
When opening an image that includes text, you might also get a message ­warning 
you that the type layers need to be updated. Generally speaking, you want to 
update them unless the image contains fonts that aren’t available on your 
­computer. And don’t forget about the Type ➪ Add Fonts from Typekit command 
to get missing fonts.

62     PART 1  Getting Started with Photoshop CC
Scanning prints
You place a photo (face down) on the glass of your scanner. You push a button. It 
automatically appears on your computer screen. That’s scanning at its most basic. 
You can save that file to your hard drive and use Photoshop’s File ➪ Open com-
mand to bring it into Photoshop for editing.
On Macs, Photoshop’s File ➪ Import ➪ Images from Device command enables you 
to scan right from Photoshop, right into Photoshop. It can also be used to down-
load images from cameras or card readers. (Windows users have WIA Support on 
the File ➪ Import menu.) The scanned image can open in Photoshop as a separate 
file or as a layer in the currently active document. The Import Images from Device 
dialog box is shown in Figure 4-2.
To the right in Figure 4-2, you see a column of options available when work-
ing with a scanner. You can elect to scan as color or grayscale (the Black & White 
option), set the resolution and print dimensions, rotate the image, and elect to 
identify separate photos placed on the scanner’s glass. In addition to JPEG, avail-
able file formats include TIFF and PDF (as well as a number of other formats 
you’ll likely not use for scanning). Other available options include manual color 
PURCHASING COMMERCIAL IMAGES
Some projects require images that you can’t run out and shoot yourself. Say, for exam-
ple, that you’re preparing a poster or brochure about a ski trip to Japan. In your office 
or studio. In the United States. In July. Pretty tough to shoot what you need, eh? Turn 
to stock photography. You can purchase or license stock images (photos, illustrations, 
video, and even audio) from a wide variety of sources, including Internet-based services 
and collections on CD/DVD.
When you consider using stock images, keep in mind the difference between royalty-free 
and rights-managed images. Royalty-free images are yours to use as you see fit (within 
the terms of your agreement — no resale as stock photos, no defamatory or porno-
graphic use, and so on). You can use the images when you need them, as often as you 
need them. Rights-managed images, on the other hand, are licensed for a specific use, in 
specific media, for a specified time. Rights-managed artwork does have one advantage 
over royalty-free: Because usage is controlled, you can license exclusive rights to the 
image for that period of time so that the image you use won’t appear in some competi-
tor’s advertising at the same time. Royalty-free images, on the other hand, are available 
to anyone who pays for them, and usage is not controlled. Keep in mind Adobe’s own 
collection of stock photography. Assuming you’re online, you can browse the collection 
by choosing Photoshop’s File ➪ Search Adobe Stock.

CHAPTER 4  Getting Images into and out of Photoshop     63
correction (do it in Photoshop instead), three levels of sharpening (again, a task 
to be done in Photoshop), and descreening to remove moiré patterns (discussed 
later in this chapter).
When you’ve finished scanning, choose File ➪ Close or use the shortcut ⌘  +W/ 
Ctrl+W to close the window — no Quit or Cancel button is available.
Using Photoshop’s Crop and Straighten Photos enables you to scan multiple pho-
tos in a single pass; then have Photoshop separate them into individual files. Read 
about using this command in Chapter 16.
Determining scan resolution
Before scanning an image, you need to make some decisions:
»
» How you want to use the image
»
» What its final size will be
»
» What resolution you need
If your scanner’s software doesn’t offer you the option to input final dimensions 
in inches, just pixels, you may need to calculate the size. By determining how 
many pixels you need beforehand, you eliminate the need to resize the image 
in Photoshop (and the possibility of image degradation). Many scanner interface 
FIGURE 4-2: 
Access your 
scanner

right into

64     PART 1  Getting Started with Photoshop CC
windows let you input the final size and resolution you need right in the scan 
window. If you find the need to calculate scan resolution manually, here’s how:
1.	 Determine the required pixel dimensions.
•	 For print: If you’ll be printing the image, determine the size at which you 
want to print (in inches) and the resolution at which you want to print 
(typically 300 ppi [pixels per inch] is a good choice). Multiply the print width 
and height by the resolution to determine pixel dimensions.
•	 For the web: If the image is destined for your website, determine how much 
of your page the image will occupy (in pixels).
2.	 Measure the original.
Before placing it on the scanner’s glass, measure the original image. If you’re 
using only part of the image, measure that part. (Be careful not to scratch the 
original with your ruler!)
3.	 Do the math.
Divide your required pixel dimensions (Step 1) by the physical dimensions of 
the original (Step 2). The result is your scan resolution. (If you get different 
numbers for the width and height, use the larger and expect to do some 
cropping in Photoshop.)
Many flatbed scanners (scanners designed for use with documents and photos) 
have transparency adapters that let you scan film and slides. However, if you have a 
lot of negatives or slides to scan or if the best possible quality is required, consider 
a dedicated film scanner from Nikon, Minolta, or Kodak.
You can also add image files to your hard drive using Bridge’s Get Photos 
from Camera. However, using Import Images from Device does offer one huge 
advantage — it’s “sticky.” In other words, the dialog box doesn’t go away after 
the first import. Say, for example, that you have images on a single Flash card 
from three different projects or locations and you want to download them into 
three different folders. When using Get Photos from Camera, you wait for Bridge’s 
Photos Downloader to examine the entire card, you select the first batch of photos, 
you download, and then Adobe Photo Downloader goes away. To download the 
second set, you start from scratch (including re-examining the entire card and 
waiting for thumbnails to generate). When importing directly from Photoshop, 
you select the first set of images, choose a location, download; select the second 
set, choose a different location, download; select the third set, choose a third 
location, download, close the window.

CHAPTER 4  Getting Images into and out of Photoshop     65
Preventing moiré patterns
Unless you spent thousands of dollars on your scanner, you probably want to forget 
about the scanner software’s color and tonal correction capabilities — Photoshop 
gives you more control. However, here is one thing that scanner software does 
much better than Photoshop, and it’s a capability that you should use when 
appropriate: moiré (pronounced, roughly, mwah-RAY) reduction. A moiré pattern 
is a visible rosette pattern created by the pattern of dots placed by the printing 
press to reproduce color.
When you need to scan a color image 
or artwork that comes from a book, 
magazine, or newspaper (or other 
material printed on an offset print-
ing press, such as product packaging 
or signs), you want to use the scan-
ner’s software to reduce moiré. When 
you let the scanner know the pat-
tern is there, the scanner’s software 
compensates for the pattern and smoothes the scanned image (as you can see in 
Figure 4-3).
The moiré reduction feature in your scanner’s software might not be immediately 
recognizable. It might be labeled Descreening, or it could be a choice between 
Color (Photo) and Color (Document). As always, refer to your hardware’s User 
Guide for specific guidance.
If rescanning is out of the question and you have a moiré pattern to reduce in 
Photoshop, blur the image enough to disguise the problem, and then paint with 
the History Brush to restore areas of critical detail in the image.
Here’s an important announcement from The Department of an Ounce of Prevention 
is Worth a Pound of Cure: A minute or two spent cleaning the scanner could save 
hours of touch-up in Photoshop. Before doing any scanning, use a can of com-
pressed air to make sure that the scanner’s glass is clean and free of dust. Like-
wise, check the inside of the scanner’s lid. (What good does it do to clean the glass 
if dust from the lid is going to contaminate it again as soon as you close it?) If 
necessary, eliminate fingerprints or smears with appropriate glass cleaner. (Check 
the scanner’s User Guide for cleaning instructions and be careful when using liq-
uid glass cleaner with an electrical device! I like to use the same premoistened 
wipes I use for my eyeglasses.)
You can use a burst of compressed air on the original image, too, before placing 
it on the glass. Just be careful — first spray a quick burst away from the photo to 
clear the nozzle, hold the can of air some distance away from the photo, and spray 
at an angle so that you don’t damage the surface of the print.

moiré reduction option.

66     PART 1  Getting Started with Photoshop CC
Keeping Your Images Organized
Because digital photography doesn’t have a significant per-shot cost (as did 
shooting film), people certainly have a tendency to shoot more. And more. And 
more. You find experimental shots, this-might-be-interesting shots, special 
effects shots, and (at least in my case) the same shot over and over and over again. 
They build up on your hard drive.
It’s pretty easy to stay organized after you choose a system. The hard part is 
­actually deleting those digital photos that you really don’t need to keep — you 
know, out-of-focus, shot at a bad angle, Aunt Betsy’s eyes were closed and her 
mouth was open, the 400th shot of the dogs sleeping all curled up, the 401st shot 
of the dogs sleeping all curled up, and the like. It takes discipline! (Or an external 
drive, USB storage, and for older computers, an optical drive that can burn CDs 
and/or DVDs.)
Creating a folder structure
I generally recommend using a subject-based organization scheme, such as 
the one shown in Figure  4-4. For example, inside the main folder named 
­AllVacationPhotos, you might have subfolders with names such as London-
Feb2017, NHL_ 31CityTour, or perhaps BackyardCamping _Sept_2016. (Notice 
that none of the folder names use empty spaces or characters other than let-
ters, numbers, a dash, and an underscore, which minimizes the possibility that 
­Photoshop or another program won’t be able to find a file.)
Don’t overload your folders! If you find that your computer is slowing down 
when it tries to display the content of a folder, you have too many files in the 
folder. Create a second folder of the same name and add -01 and -02 to the folder 
names. Generally speaking, 500MB is probably as large as you want in a single 
folder.
You can use external drives or USB storage (or your computer’s CD/DVD drive if 
it has one) to create folders of images. This not only provides you with a reliable 
backup (assuming that you store the devices or disks correctly and handle them 
carefully), but it can also free up space on your hard drive. Your folder/subfolder 
structure can also be used when creating your discs.

CHAPTER 4  Getting Images into and out of Photoshop     67
Using Adobe Bridge
Adobe Bridge, the asset-management program for Photoshop and other Adobe 
programs, is a separate program in the Creative Cloud Manager. You can open 
Bridge independently, or you can choose File ➪ Browse in Bridge from Photo-
shop’s main menu to launch Bridge — seen launched in Figure 4-5. If you choose 
Bridge’s Preferences ➪ Advanced command, you can elect to have Bridge launch 
automatically whenever you log in to your computer.

68     PART 1  Getting Started with Photoshop CC
In Figure 4-5, note the Publish tab in the upper-right, nested with the Preview 
tab. That gives you direct access to Adobe Stock, enabling you to submit your 
images for sale as stock photos right from Bridge.
Here are a few tips for working with Adobe Bridge:
»
» Use keywords and categories. Using the Keywords tab (shown in Figure 4-6), 
to the lower right in Bridge’s default layout, you can assign keywords and 
categories to images. Keywords and categories are descriptive terms that you 
assign to individual images. Down the road, you can choose File ➪ Find to find 
all images with a specific assigned keyword. A checkmark to the left of a 
keyword indicates that all the files currently selected in Bridge’s Thumbnails 
pane have that keyword assigned, a dash indicates that some, but not all, 
selected images have been assigned that keyword.
»
» Select multiple images in Bridge. You can have multiple images active by 
clicking and Shift+clicking (or ⌘  +clicking/Ctrl+clicking) the image thumbnails. 
You might want to select multiple images and then assign the same keywords 
to all the selected images at once.
»
» Use labels, ratings, and filters. Under the Label menu, you can assign a star 
rating to each image and assign colors to organize by subject or project. Use 
the View ➪ Sort menu to arrange images in the thumbnails area of Bridge 
according to either the label or the rating.
FIGURE 4-6: 
Assign 
­keywords and 
categories to 
help organize 
(and locate) 
images.

CHAPTER 4  Getting Images into and out of Photoshop     69
»
» Add folders to the Favorites. You invariably will visit some folders on a 
regular basis. Choose File ➪ Add to Favorites to get back to that folder faster 
and more easily. In the upper-left corner of the Bridge window, click the 
Favorites tab for one-click access. Keep in mind, too, that you can add a folder 
to the Favorites while working on a specific project, and then choose 
File ➪ Remove from Favorites when the project is finished.
»
» Change your view and workspace. Use the View menu to customize what 
the Bridge window shows, and use the Window ➪ Workspace menu to 
determine how it is displayed. You might find that Compact Mode fits your 
needs better in some circumstances than does Full Mode. And don’t overlook 
Bridge’s Slideshow feature — it can be a great way to show off your work!
»
» Use stacks to organize images. Select similar images or variations on 
the same shot and use Bridge’s Stacks ➪ Group as Stack command. All the 
selected images are piled into one spot as a single thumbnail, with a number 
in the upper-left corner to indicate how many images are stacked together. 
When you have ten or more images in a stack, you can scroll through the 
thumbnails with a slider that appears when you move the cursor over 
the stack.
»
» Zoom with the Loupe. Click in the Preview (in the upper-right corner of the 
default workspace) to zoom in. Drag the cursor to inspect the preview up 
close and personal. Use your mouse’s scroll wheel or your trackpad to zoom 
from 100% to as high as 800%.
»
» Access Photoshop scripts. In Bridge’s Tools menu, you’ll find a submenu 
named Photoshop (as well as menus for other installed programs that use 
Bridge). Through that menu, you can easily access Photoshop’s Batch, Image 
Processor, Photomerge, and a number of other features. Select the thumb-
nails in Bridge first, then select the feature you want to use. Perhaps my 
favorite command in the menu is Load Files into Photoshop Layers — all of 
the files selected in Bridge are opened into a single Photoshop document, 
each on its own layer. It’s a fabulous time saver when preparing a series of 
images for use with Photoshop’s stack modes. (For more on layers and stack 
modes, see Chapter 18.)
If you enjoy macro photography — taking close up shots of little things — you 
can shoot a series of images with different focal points (using a tripod, of course), 
then use Bridge’s Load Files in Photoshop Layers command. After the files load, 
choose Select ➪ All Layers from Photoshop’s menu bar (did you know about that 
command — very handy, eh?), choose Edit ➪ Auto-Align Layers (even if you did 
use a tripod), then choose Edit ➪ Auto-Blend Layers with the Stack Images option. 
Each of the in-focus areas is combined to a single all-in-focus image using layer 
masks. (See Figure 4-7.)

70     PART 1  Getting Started with Photoshop CC
Renaming image files easily
All right then, you’ve arranged a hierarchy of folders and subfolders. You’ve sorted 
your images into those folders. You’ve assigned ratings and labels to the images. 
However, you still have no idea which is which on the File ➪ Open Recent menu. 
Filenames such as _MG_1907.CR2 and PB270091.jpg don’t tell you much about the 
image content, do they? Use Bridge’s Tools ➪ Batch Rename command (as shown 
in Figure 4-8) to assign more meaningful (and informative) names to your files. 
Select content from each field from the pop-up menu or type in a field. Click the + 
button to the right to add more elements or variables to each name.
FIGURE 4-7:

and auto-

FIGURE 4-8:

to assign

names to files.

CHAPTER 4  Getting Images into and out of Photoshop     71
So that each of your original images gets a unique name, you must include a vari-
able when using Batch Rename. (If you did try to rename all the images in a folder 
to say, picture.jpg, you would end up with only one image file in the destina-
tion folder — each would overwrite the previous.) Therefore, when using Batch 
Rename, you must choose one of the variables for one of the fields via the pop-up 
menu, be it the original document name or a sequence number/letter.
Also keep in mind that you shouldn’t type a period (.) into any field. That character 
should be used only before the file extension. And, as a wonderful keep-us-from-
creating-problems-for-ourselves improvement, Batch Rename automatically 
adds the file extension for you.
Printing Your Images
In the very recent past, the subject of printing images from Photoshop required a 
huge number of pages. Thankfully, improvements in hardware and software make 
printing much easier. Monitors are well calibrated out of the box, printers repro-
duce color more accurately, and inks and papers last for decades. Yes, things have 
come a long way in a short time. But before you click the Print button, you should 
make sure that your image is ready to print. Will it fit properly on the page and 
in the frame? Are the pixels small enough that they blend evenly into the overall 
picture? Will the colors you envision be the colors that appear on paper?
Cropping to a specific aspect ratio
Aspect ratio is the relationship between the width and height of your image. An 
image in landscape aspect ratio is wider than it is tall, and an image in portrait 
aspect ratio is taller than it is wide. Although digital cameras capture in a variety 
of aspect ratios, including 3:4 and 4:5, DSLR (digital single lens reflex) cameras 
typically use a 3:2 aspect ratio: One side is 1.5 times the size of the adjoining sides. 
Typical print (and picture frame) sizes are 8x10 inches (a 4:5 aspect ratio), 5 x 7 
inches (5:7), 4 x 6 inches (3:2), and 3 x 5 inches (3:5). In Figure 4-9, the 3:2 aspect 
ratio is outlined in green, 5:7 is shown in yellow, and 4:5 is red.
Although an 8 x 10 print is physically larger than a 4 x 6 print, it may print less of 
your original image because of cropping. The 4 x 6 print, with a 3:2 aspect ratio, 
includes all of the original image; the 8x10 print (with its 4:5 aspect ratio) is 
missing 2 full inches of the image’s longer dimension. To print 8 inches wide 
and retain the entire image, you’d be printing at 8 x 12. Of course, if your camera 
captures in a 4:5 aspect ratio, the problem is reversed — the original image fits 
perfectly into an 8x10 print, but won’t fill a 4 x 6 print without cropping.

72     PART 1  Getting Started with Photoshop CC
In Photoshop, you can change the aspect ratio of your image with the Canvas 
Size command (if one dimension is already correctly sized), the Crop tool, or the 
Rectangular Marquee tool with the Image ➪ Crop command. With the Crop tool 
selected and WxHxResolution selected in the menu to the left in the Options bar, 
you can enter specific dimensions and a target resolution in the three boxes to 
the right of the menu. Drag the tool, position and adjust the bounding box, and 
then press Return/Enter to execute the crop. Whatever is within the bounding 
box is resampled to the exact size that you specify on the Options bar. If you crop 
with Canvas Size or Crop commands, you may need to use Image ➪ Image Size to 
specify the desired print resolution. (And see Chapter 2 for information on Photo-
shop’s Content-Aware Scale command.)
As soon as you activate the Crop tool (use the shortcut C or click the tool icon 
in the Toolbox), a bounding box appears around your image. You’ll also see a 
variety of options in the Options bar. (See Figure  4-10.) The top inset shows 
the various preset aspect rations available in the Options bar. Note the option 
WxHxResolution — select it to crop to a specific size and resolution. The left inset 
shows the variety of overlays available, including Grid, visible over the image in 
Figure 4-10. The lower-right inset, opened by clicking the gear-shaped button in 
the Options bar, provides options on basic Crop tool behavior.
Also notice that while the image is being slightly rotated during the crop process, 
the Crop tool’s bounding box doesn’t rotate; it’s the image behind the bound-
ing box that rotates. To the right in the Options bar is the Delete Cropped Pixels 
option. When Delete Cropped Pixels is selected, the pixels outside the bounding

amounts of 
your image.

CHAPTER 4  Getting Images into and out of Photoshop     73
box are deleted, but when deselected, those pixels are hidden and can be restored 
with the Image ➪ Reveal All command.
Not all programs recognize “hidden” cropped pixels. If you’re going to place this 
image into another program or on a web page, make sure that you’re working on 
a copy of the original image and elect to delete the cropped pixels.
When creating a cropping selection with the Rectangular Marquee tool, you can 
change the tool’s Style pop-up menu (on the Options bar) from Normal to Fixed 
Ratio or Fixed Size. Generally speaking, use Fixed Ratio and drag the marquee to 
encompass that part of the image you want to retain. When the selection marquee 
is how and where you want it, choose Image ➪ Crop.
Keep in mind that the Image ➪ Crop command doesn’t resample the image  — 
you’ve just changed the aspect ratio and pixel dimensions so far — you’ll need to 
also choose Image ➪ Image Size (which is discussed in Chapter 2).
Remembering resolution
Chapter 2 presents you with an in-depth look at resolution as it pertains to digital 
imaging. As a quick refresher, keep these points in mind when thinking about 
printing your images:
»
» Images themselves have no resolution. Whether in your camera, on your 
hard drive, or open in Photoshop, your images consist only of tiny colored 
squares called pixels. The image looks and acts the same within Photoshop 
FIGURE 4-10: 
The Crop tool 
overlays can 
help when 
composing 
an image.

74     PART 1  Getting Started with Photoshop CC
(except for adding type), regardless of resolution. An image of 3,000x2,000 
pixels at 300 ppi is handled in Photoshop exactly as an image of 3,000x2,000 
pixels at 72 ppi.
»
» Resolution is an instruction to a printing device. The resolution value that 
you assign to an image in your digital camera or in Photoshop’s Image Size 
dialog box is recorded with the image strictly as an instruction to the output 
device.
»
» Resolution measures the size of individual pixels. A resolution of 300 ppi 
really means that each pixel will print at a size exactly 1 300 of an inch square. 
Likewise, 72 ppi equates to each pixel printing at 1 72 of an inch square.
»
» Web images use only pixel dimensions. Most web browsers aren’t capable 
of reading the resolution information embedded in your simple graphics by 
Photoshop. Each image is displayed in the web browser strictly according to 
the number of pixels in the image.
Controlling color using File ➪ Print
In the past few years, reproducing accurate color from monitor to printer has 
become much easier. Although the process of color management still strikes fear 
into the hearts of many, the actual need for complex hardware and software to 
control color is greatly reduced. Why? Simply because computer manufactur-
ers recognized that we, the consumers, wanted better color. Monitors ship from 
the factory calibrated and accurate. Printers use smaller droplets and better inks. 
Software does a better job of communicating color.
For most Photoshop users, accurate color is important. After spending hours 
tweaking an image’s appearance on-screen, surely you want the print to look 
exactly like the monitor. Here’s how to get that great color:
1.	 When you’re ready to output your image, choose Photoshop’s File ➪ Print 
command.
A large, one-stop-shopping Print Settings dialog box opens (see Figure 4-11).
2.	 Select your printer and the number of copies you want to print.
In the Position and Size section, you can center the image within the printer’s 
margins or offset the print. You can also elect to scale the image to fit the 
paper rather than printing at the image’s actual size. (The Printing Marks, 
Functions, and PostScript Options sections of the Print Settings dialog box are 
used almost exclusively by print shops.)

CHAPTER 4  Getting Images into and out of Photoshop     75
3.	 Set up color management.
•	 In the Color Handling pop-up menu, select Photoshop Manages Colors.
•	 In the Printer Profile pop-up menu, choose the printer’s profile for the 
paper on which you’re printing. If the Send 16-Bit Data option is available, 
and your image is in 16-bits/channel mode, you should take advantage of 
that feature.
•	 Select Normal Printing (rather than Hard Proofing) for Rendering Intent, 
choose Relative Colorimetric, and select the Black Point Compensation 
check box. (If your prints are too dark, deselect this last option.)
4.	 Click the Print button.
This takes you from the Photoshop Print Settings to the actual Print dialog box. 
If you want to print at a later time, click the Done button to record your settings 
in the image’s metadata.
5.	 Print.
Make sure the correct printer and paper size are selected and click the Print 
button to send the image to the printer and starts the actual process of putting 
ink on paper.
Considering color management solutions
If your prints don’t match your monitor, first evaluate your monitor’s settings. 
Open an image with known color values (you know what the image should look 
like) in a non-color-managed program. You might, for example, open Microsoft 
Word and choose Insert ➪ Picture ➪ From File to add an image with known color 
FIGURE 4-11: 
Photoshop’s 
Print Settings 
dialog box 
offers resizing 
and color 
management 
options.

76     PART 1  Getting Started with Photoshop CC
values (or a downloaded color chart) to a blank document. Use the monitor’s con-
trols to make that image look the best possible, and then print. If the image prints 
accurately, great — you’re all set.
If the monitor looks great but the print is strange, first try cleaning and calibrat-
ing the print head, and then print from Photoshop. And take another look at the 
Print dialog box to make sure that you’re selecting the proper paper and color 
settings. (Again, refer to the User Guide for your printer for specific instructions.)
If your work (or play) requires extreme color fidelity, a number of companies 
offer hardware and software that regulate color. You can create custom profiles 
for monitors, printers, and even scanners and digital cameras. Although not inex-
pensive, skillful handling of these tools (in accordance with the User Guides!) 
can not only results in better prints, but also reduces the amount of aw-shucks 
wasted paper and ink from bad output. If you fall into this category, explore the 
current offerings from X-Rite (www.xrite.com), PANTONE (www.pantone.com), 
and Datacolor (www.datacolor.com).
Keep in mind that all the color management hardware and software in the world 
doesn’t do you a bit of good if you’re not controlling your environment. If your 
work requires perfect color — not good, but perfect — you need to take some addi-
tional steps. In the office or studio, you need to regulate ambient light so that 
you have a consistent color-viewing situation, day in and day out, rain or shine, 
summer and winter. If you have windows, you need shades or drapes that you can 
close before doing color-critical work. The walls visible behind the monitor and 
the immediate work area should be neutral in color. (And that means no brightly 
colored sticky notes on the bezel of your monitor!) You probably need a hood for 
your monitor and perhaps a D50 (or D65) viewing station in which to evaluate 
your prints under optimal lighting conditions.
Printing alternatives
Many Photoshop folks use an inkjet printer to put their photos on paper. Although 
inkjet printers are the most popular and perhaps the most practical, you do have 
alternatives. If, for example, your work consists mainly of brochures and flyers 
rather than photos, a color laser printer might better fit your needs. The initial 
cost of a high-quality color laser printer is generally higher than all except wide-
format inkjets, but the cost per page is much lower. Color laser printers generally 
don’t print photographs as well as a mid- to high-end inkjet, and the prints aren’t 
archival (they won’t last for a whole lot of years without fading), but such prints 
might be just fine for sharing snapshots among friends and family. Take a look at 
the User Guide for the specific printer you use to set up your job correctly.

CHAPTER 4  Getting Images into and out of Photoshop     77
Dye sublimation printers use rolls of film impregnated with dyes to reproduce 
prints. Prices for these printers range from less than $200 to several thousand 
dollars. The quality and longevity of the prints is generally tied to the price.
Here’s another output alternative available to virtually all Photoshop users. Burn 
your images in JPEG format (highest quality, 300 ppi) onto a CD or other remov-
able media and take it to the local photo lab. Alternatively, use an online service 
with which you upload your JPEGs to the service’s web service to order prints. 
(Check with the lab or service to see whether you need to use the sRGB color profile 
for your images.) You’ll get back glossy or matte prints at the size(s) requested. 
And the cost per print can be substantially less than using your inkjet printer. The 
local photo lab is often a great alternative for stacks of vacation photos and family 
reunion shots that need to be sent to a whole passel of kin.
Unless your inkjet printer is specifically designed to handle grayscale images, you 
might want to use a photo lab for such prints. Inkjet printers designed with gray-
scale in mind output using black ink plus one or more supplemental gray (or 
“light black”) inks to increase the tonal range and ensure adequate detail in your 
shadows. Inkjets that aren’t designed to print grayscale can either print using 
only black ink (which severely limits the detail and tonal range) or they print with 
all of the installed inks (which invariably leads to some color tint or color cast 
in the supposedly neutral grayscale images). Check 
the printer’s User Guide.
Sharing Your Images
Photoshop offers a number of nifty ways to make 
it easy to share your images with others. (And, of 
course, you might simply send a CD of JPEG files 
to a friend or client with instructions to double-
click each one to view the images.) However, there 
are certainly more elegant ways to showcase your 
talents. Images can also be uploaded to a variety of 
social media sites and you can e-mail links to those 
pages to anyone with whom you want to share your 
work. Photoshop’s File ➪ Share command give you 
direct access to a number of ways to share images 
(see Figure 4-12).
Before uploading images to a social media site, 
check that site’s image size and format require-
ments. And make sure that you make a copy of your 
original before preparing it for upload.
FIGURE 4-12: 
You can share your images 
directly from Photoshop 
(assuming your computer 
is connected to the Internet, 
of course).

78     PART 1  Getting Started with Photoshop CC
Creating PDFs and websites
Portable Document Format (PDF), the native file format of Adobe Acrobat, has 
become an incredibly useful and near-universal format. It’s hard to find a com-
puter that doesn’t have Adobe Reader (free software to open and view PDF files) or 
another PDF-capable program (such as the Mac’s Preview), and that helps make 
PDF a wonderful format for sharing or distributing your images. Photoshop offers 
PDF Presentation in the File menu. Read about PDF Presentation and the very use-
ful Contact Sheet II feature in Chapter 16.
While not officially supported by Adobe (despite the plug-in’s name), you can add 
the optional Adobe Output Manager to Bridge to create both PDF presentations 
and web galleries:
https://helpx.adobe.com/bridge/kb/install-output-module-bridge-cc.html
(Make sure that Bridge is up to date; choose Help ➪ Updates.)
Emailing your images
Remember, too, that you can send images via email. Keep in mind, however, if you 
like these folks enough to send them your images, you probably want to keep their 
friendship. And to that end, you want to be a responsible emailer —you don’t want 
to send out an e-mail attachment so large that it disrupts service for the recipient. 
(“Hi Marge. You know those images from your vacation that you e-mailed me on 
Tuesday? They’re still trying to download. Yeah, today is Saturday. Anyway, why 
don’t I drive up to Maine and look at the snapshots — it’s probably faster than 
waiting for the email.”)
As a general rule, your attached images should rarely if ever total more than 2MB 
in size (unless you verify through direct communication that everyone on your To 
list can handle large attachments). Each image should be no more than 1200 pix-
els tall so that it can be viewed in a web browser on most monitors and the most 
popular tablets. (Keep in mind, too, that some older smartphones have screens 
that are only 720 pixels tall.) You can certainly use your computer’s compression 
utility to compress one or more images before sending. But if you do compress 
your attached images, make sure to include instructions to save the compressed 
file to the hard drive and double-click to expand.

What’s New in 
Photoshop CC?
I
f this is your first version of Photoshop, this chapter isn’t as important as it is 
for those upgrading from an earlier version. However, that doesn’t mean you 
should skip it — you find lots of useful information here. Many of these features 
are also discussed in other chapters, but some explanations you find only here.
Improvements and New Features
Adobe is always making improvements to Photoshop, some you’ll find indispens-
able; some are just useful to know.
The new features you’re  
most likely to love
Since the last version of Photoshop CC was released, new features and improve-
ments (so-called “bug fixes”) have been introduced regularly. Many of them you’ll 
never even notice, but some of them add significant and powerful capabilities

80     PART 1  Getting Started with Photoshop CC
to Photoshop. Here is a look at some big and little changes since the introduction 
of Photoshop CC:
»
» Learn Panel and Rich Tooltips: Okay, newbie, Adobe has made it much 
simpler to figure out which feature does what. In the default Essentials 
workspace, you’ll find a new panel named Learn. (In other workspaces or 
custom workspaces, you can make Learn visible through Photoshop’s Window 
menu.) Click one of the subjects and you’ll find a number of videos on the 
subject. When you park the cursor over a tool, not only do you get the tool’s 
name, you’ll get a short explanation of what it does and, in many cases, you’ll 
also see a video and even a “Learn More” link. (If you find Rich Tooltips to be 
annoying, disable them in the Tools pane of Photoshop’s Preferences.)
»
» Perspective Warp: Using grids, this feature enables you to do a couple of 
tasks that are very difficult to do manually in Photoshop. You can align a grid 
to straighten a building or other subject in an image and you can also use 
Edit ➪  Perspective Warp to change the vantage point in the image, effectively 
altering the position from which the image was shot, without distorting or 
stretching anything in the image (see Figure 5-1). You can also use multiple 
grids in an image to make multiple changes.
»
» Motion blurs: The Blur Gallery now includes Spin Blur and Path Blur to 
simulate circular blurs and blurs that could be created using a slower shutter 
speed while moving the camera. You’ll also find that the Blur Gallery now 
allows you to add monochromatic or color noise to better match the original 
image.
»
» Content-Aware improvements: You find a new command in the Edit menu: 
Content-Aware Fill. The Content-Aware option for the Fill command remains, 
but this new command includes something special. You find a brush with 
which you can designate areas to be used for the content of your fill. It can 
FIGURE 5-1:

and squares 
images taken 
at an angle.

CHAPTER 5  What’s New in Photoshop CC?     81
also be used to designate areas that you don’t want used for the fill. Overall, 
Content-Aware features now do a much better job with gradients and areas of 
similar color, such as skies. The improvements are across the board, including 
the content-aware modes for the Patch and Move tools. Content-Aware is 
available in the Crop tool’s Options bar for situations in which you need to 
rotate or increase the canvas size. It uses adjacent pixels to fill in what would 
be transparent areas of the canvas.
»
» Select and Mask: This is much more 
robust than the Refine Edge it replaces. 
(The Refine Edge brush is included 
among the tools to the left in the Preview 
pane.) It gives you much more control 
over the edges of your selections. See its 
Properties panel in Figure 5-2.
»
» Select ➪ Focus Area: This new feature 
enables you to make selections based on 
what areas of an image are sharpest. The 
dialog box includes sliders to adjust the 
amount of “in focus” you want to include 
and noise control, as well as a button 
that will take you directly to the Select 
and Mask feature. You can elect to 
output the result to a selection, mask, 
new layer (with or without a mask), and 
even to a new document.
»
» Typekit Marketplace: Typekit can now 
access some of the major font suppliers 
and uses its font sync and web to access 
your Marketplace fonts anywhere you need them.
»
» Linked Smart Objects: Rather than embedding a placed file into your 
working document, this feature allows you to embed only a link to the placed 
image file. This can be great at keeping file sizes small and saving space on 
your hard drive, but keep in mind that if you move the linked file, the link is 
broken and the master document won’t be able to find the image automati-
cally. Also keep in mind that if you send the master document to someone 
else, you’ll need to include the linked file (and re-do the links), so embedding 
the placed image often makes more sense and prevents potential problems 
and wasted time.
»
» If/Then in Actions: While recording an Action, you can select Conditional 
Action from the Action panel’s menu. You can select from among two dozen 
situations to determine what steps should follow in the Action. The condition-
als include various document attributes, such as color mode, bit depth, layers, 
FIGURE 5-2: 
Click the arrows to the left of three lower 
sections for even more control.

82     PART 1  Getting Started with Photoshop CC
and alpha channels. There are also layer-related conditions, such as what type 
of layer is active (background, adjustment, shape layer, and so on).
»
» Smart Object improvements: You can now apply Liquify and Blur Gallery 
effects non-destructively by using Smart Objects.
»
» Face-Aware Liquify: Liquify can now (most of the time) identify faces in a 
photo. It’s not perfect (yet), but it can be very helpful. It can even allow you to 
adjust each eye independently.
»
» Smart Sharpen changes: An all new Smart Sharpen algorithm puts the older 
version to shame. If you avoided Smart Sharpen in the past, relying instead on 
Unsharp Mask, give the new version a spin — you’ll find it does a much better 
job of minimizing halos and noise, while maximizing clarity.
»
» The Glyphs panel: This panel, shown in Figure 5-3, like those in Illustrator CC 
and InDesign CC, permits you to view all available glyphs for a particular font. 
(Not all fonts have additional glyphs.) As you can see, you can also select a 
character on the page and see all of its possible variations.
»
» Match Font: Using an existing image or photo, Photoshop can now help you 
identify and match fonts. (Latin fonts only at this time.)
»
» Share: Found in the File menu and as a button in the upper-right corner of the 
workspace, Share enables you to easily add your images to various social 
media platforms.
»
» Artboards: Useful for multiscreen designs, Artboards let you create a single 
document and have multiple layouts for different devices and sizes. You can 
copy items among various Artboards. Each layout can be exported individually 
or several at a time.
»
» Search: Using the command Edit ➪ Search or the keyboard shortcut ⌘  /Ctrl+F 
you can open the new Search dialog box; see Figure 5-4. (Yes, that shortcut no 
longer applies the previous filter. You’ll need to add the Option/Alt key for that. 
FIGURE 5-3: 
Many fonts 
include 
­alternate 
­versions 
of various 
characters and 
symbols.

CHAPTER 5  What’s New in Photoshop CC?     83
If it becomes frustrating, change ‘em up in Edit ➪ Keyboard Shortcuts.) You can 
search for tools, panels, menu commands, document presets, open docu-
ments, recent documents, and more.
»
» Adjustable path appearance: Another “Why has this taken so long?” feature, 
Photoshop now allows you to change the width and color of paths. Select a 
path creating tool, click the Gear in the Options box, customize the path 
appearance as desired. (Remember that paths don’t print; they just appear 
in the Photoshop window.)
»
» Preserve Details 2.0: Activated by default in the Technology Previews section 
of Photoshop’s Preferences, this option is available to you when using the 
Image Size command to enlarge your artwork.
Additional new features
Adobe has also added quite a few other features (more than two dozen), which 
may or may not have any impact on your workflow. You may never need these 
features, but I want you to know that they exist. Some are specific to one system 
FIGURE 5-4:

or even one machine. (I haven’t bothered to list simple “bug fixes” and security 
improvements.) If any of these features interests you, you can find out more:
https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/features.html
»
» One-click to unlock Background layer: Rather than having to double-click 
the name Background in the Layers panel and rename the layer, you now just 
need to click the Lock icon to the right of the layer name.
»
» Select background color for new documents: The New Document dialog 
box lets you choose any color for the background of a new document. 
Photoshop also offers a number of templates from which to choose when 
creating a new document.
»
» Recently used colors: The Swatches panel shows the most recently used 
colors at the top, making it easy to re-select a color you need.
»
» Clear all color samplers: The Options bar for the Color Sampler tool now 
offers the option to delete all samplers, rather than having to clear them one 
at a time.
»
» Longer layer names: Layer names can now be as long as 255 characters, though 
why you’d want such long layer names is a bit of a mystery to many of us.
»
» Sync Settings: There are now upload and download buttons to sync your 
custom settings from one machine to another through the Cloud. You can 
sync all settings, some settings, or no settings. This feature is not cross- 
platform — you can’t sync between Windows and Mac.
»
» Touch Bar support: If you have a MacBook Pro that includes the Touch Bar, 
you can access Photoshop commands, blend modes, and colors. (This feature 
is available only for MacBook Pro models that include the Touch Bar, as I’m 
sure you have guessed.)
»
» Templates: When you open Photoshop or go to the File ➪  New command 
you can access a variety of templates that you can use as the basis for as new 
project.
»
» Creative Cloud Libraries: Libraries now support Adobe Stock templates and 
Send Link now permits you to post a read-only version of your project to a 
public library.
»
» 3D export to PDF: Export from Photoshop as PDF files so that clients and 
colleagues can manipulate them in Adobe Acrobat.
»
» OpenType SVG fonts: The Trajan Color, EmojiOne, Minion Variable Concept, 
and Acumin Variable Concept fonts enable you to apply different colors and 
even gradients to individual glyphs. In the Fonts menu, you see a little “SVG” 
at the bottom of the O that identifies OpenType fonts. More SVG fonts will 
become available as the concept catches on. The Font panel has also gone a 

CHAPTER 5  What’s New in Photoshop CC?     85
major revision, which even allows you to show only certain types of fonts, 
such as serif or sans serif.
»
» Improved 3D printing for Windows 10: Color and texture are better 
preserved for printing using Microsoft’s 3MF file format.
»
» Support for Windows HiDPI displays: More pixels, sharper image displays. 
Photoshop will automatically start this feature when it detects a HiDPI display.
»
» Windows 8.1 and later touch support: When working with a touch device, 
Photoshop now supports rotate, zoom, pinch, and pan gestures.
»
» Customizable toolbars and workspaces: You can now save multiple toolbar 
configurations as parts of custom workspaces.
»
» Improved Export: It’s faster and allows you to export the same assets at 
different sizes. You also have some metadata options when exporting, 
including copyright info.
»
» Copy/paste layers between documents: You can now use the Copy and 
Paste commands to transfer layers from one document to another. (You can 
still drag a layer from the Layers panel to another open document.) If the 
documents have different pixel dimensions, the copy/paste process does not 
resize the layer.
»
» Speed: The Adobe Mercury Graphics Engine provides much faster perfor-
mance with a number of features. Check out the speed improvement for 
Content-Aware features!
»
» Move tool change: Here’s a simple but very welcome change to the Move 
tool: The Options bar default for Auto-Select is (finally) Layer rather than 
Group. (See? Nagging can make a difference!)
»
» ⌘  /Ctrl+F: As mentioned above in the discussion of Search, this keyboard 
shortcut no longer applies the previous filter, but instead opens the Search 
dialog box. Option+⌘  /Alt+Ctrl+F the new shortcut for applying the previous 
filter. (You can change that in Edit ➪  Keyboard Shortcuts if it remains a 
problem for you.)
New to Camera Raw
The engineers at Adobe didn’t just make improvements and add features to 
­Photoshop, the Camera Raw plug-in got some love, too. There are new features, 
improved performance, and changes such as moving the Upright adjustments 
from the Lens Correction panel to the new Transform tool.

86     PART 1  Getting Started with Photoshop CC
»
» Additional camera support: As soon as Adobe has a handle on a new 
camera’s Raw capabilities and format, it’s added to Camera Raw. You’ll also 
find lots of new lens profiles.
»
» Pressure-sensitive device support: Wacom tablets and Windows Surface 
Pro devices can now take advantage of pressure sensitivity for the Local 
Adjustment Brush and the Eraser tool (if you’re using a stylus with an eraser, 
of course). Set the flow to maximum value and control how it behaves with 
lighter or heavier pressure.
»
» Guided Upright in the Transform panel: With the Transform tool selected, 
you can adjust perspective with up to four lines drawn on your photo. 
Photoshop uses these to straighten and align objects in an image (see 
Figure 5-5). The original manual transform controls for rotating, adjusting 
vertical and horizontal lines, rotation, scale, and aspect — and the Level, 
Vertical, Auto, and Full Upright modes — have been moved from the Lens

More Sensei Coming Soon to Photoshop
At the Adobe MAX conference in October 2017, Adobe announced that Adobe Sen-
sei will play a larger role in Photoshop. (Or, depending on when you’re reading 
this, it may already be doing so.)
What is Sensei?
Accessed by clicking a blue circle in the upper-right corner of Photoshop, Sen-
sei is Adobe’s “creative intelligence” and “design intelligence” (try to avoid the 
term “artificial intelligence”). Already used in Face-Aware Liquify, it will add a 
number of very powerful features. Among them are a capability to identify various 
elements in a photo or sketch and then search your photos and Adobe Stock for 
related images and templates.
The coolest capabilities
Based on content, auto-masking will save hours of work for many photographers 
and designers. Using “design intelligence,” Sensei can search through your past 
projects for various elements, including, for example, text layouts and social 
media layouts. Mind blowing, Sensei will be at least partially voice controlled.

Making Tonality and

hen an image really pops — when it jumps off the page at you — it’s 
generally because the shadows are dark, the highlights are light, and 
the colors are rich. I’m sure it’s no surprise to you that Photoshop can 
handle the job. (That’s one of the reasons why you subscribe to the program, 
right?)
In this chapter, I introduce you to the concept of tonality, which is the range of 
brightness in your image. I also introduce to you the various commands that 
­Photoshop offers for you to adjust your image’s tonality. A couple of tools even 
give you pin-point control of shadows and highlights. After reviewing and 
adjusting the tonality of the image, it’s time to work with color. The second 
half of this chapter explores the various features available for working with your 
image’s color.

Adjusting Tonality to  
Make Your Images Pop
Most photos look better with a little 
tweaking. For pictures that look good 
to begin with, you might still want 
to perk them up a little with a tonal 
adjustment. Making the shadows a 
little darker and the highlights a bit 
lighter increases your image’s per-
ceived tonal range, which is sort of 
the distance between black and white. 
Take a look at Figure 6-1. It’s a pleas-
ant enough snapshot, with decent 
composition and an interesting sub-
ject. But it lacks pizzazz.
With Photoshop, you can darken the 
shadows and lighten the rest of the 
image to make it more interesting. By 
intensifying the difference between 
what the eye sees as dark and what 
the eye sees as light in the image, you 
add some semblance of depth to this 
simple picture. Comparing Figure 6-1 
with Figure 6-2, you can see that one 
basic tonal adjustment can also make 
the colors seem richer and even pro-
duce a perceived increase in detail and 
sharpness.
You might hear a number of words used for the same concept: the lightness and 
darkness of your image. Tonality, luminosity, and even brightness can be used 
virtually interchangeably when you’re talking about the general subject. However, 
you typically use brightness when talking about specific pixels and tonality when 
referring to the image as a whole.
Histograms Simplified
In most photographs of general subject matter, your eye sees the darkest neu-
tral (gray) tone as black and the lightest neutral as white. (If the darkest color is 
FIGURE 6-1: 
A nice snapshot, but not art.
FIGURE 6-2: 
One simple tonal adjustment darkens, lightens, 
enriches color, and brings out detail.

CHAPTER 6  Making Tonality and Color Look Natural     93
obviously purple and the lightest a bright yellow, you probably wouldn’t classify 
the photo’s subject matter as “general.”) In a given image, the shadow under the 
shoe might be just a dark gray, and the shirt looks like it might need some bleach, 
but your mind (in cooperation with your eye) compensates to some degree and 
lets you see black and white.
For a more accurate look at the tonal range of your image, Photoshop offers the 
Histogram panel, which displays the distribution of the pixels in your image at 
various luminosity values. The darker pixels (shadows) are stacked at the left 
end, the lighter pixels (highlights) are stacked at the right end, and the rest of the 
brightness values (midtones) are stacked between. The taller a column in the his-
togram, the more pixels at that luminosity value.
As you look at histograms in this chapter and in your own work, keep in mind that 
the color coding in the histogram shows where there are preponderances of pixels 
of specific color at certain luminosity values. Where the histogram shows red or 
green or blue, the pixels at that brightness level are primarily in one channel of an 
RGB image. The cyan and magenta and yellow areas of the histogram show pixels 
in two of the RGB channels. When pixels in a specific tonal range appear in all 
three RGB channels, you’ll see gray in the histogram.
Consider, if you will, an image that 
consists primarily of white pixels, per-
haps a beautiful Alpine snow scene or 
an ugly creepy-crawly thing on por-
celain (as you can see in Figure 6-3).  
Either image has a histogram skewed 
dramatically to the right  — what 
you call a high-key image. Nothing 
is wrong with the image (despite the 
histogram); it just happens to have a 
huge number of light-colored pixels.
Likewise, a low-key image has a pre-
ponderance of dark pixels, which 
skews the histogram to the left. Just 
about any night scene has a very large 
number of very dark pixels, pulling 
the distribution to the left in the histogram. But many night scenes also include 
lights, which produce a spike at the far right end.
Keep in mind, too, that the heights of the individual columns in the histogram area 
are relative: The tallest goes all the way to the top of the box, and the others are 
scaled accordingly. For example, an image on a black background — say, a large 
black background — might have so many pixels in the leftmost column that the 
FIGURE 6-3: 
The histogram is skewed to the right because 
of the many white pixels. Or maybe it’s trying to 
escape the spider.

94     PART 2  Easy Enhancements for Digital Images
other columns in the image appear 
tiny and almost unreadable, like the 
histogram shown in Figure 6-4.
If the histogram is skewed to one end 
or the other, making it hard to read, 
you can make a selection within the 
image and the histogram updates to 
show information for only the selected 
area. (Read about making selections 
in Chapter 8.) If the image has mul-
tiple layers or adjustment layers, the 
little pop-up menu below the histo-
gram (when in Expanded View mode) 
enables you to specify what layer to 
calculate.
As you read later in this chapter (in the section “Level-headed you!”), you can use 
the histogram to help avoid degrading your image while making adjustments, and 
(as you can read in Chapter 7) it’s very important for working with the Camera 
Raw plug-in. But don’t forget about your eyeballs — you don’t need the Histo-
gram panel to spot a low-key or high-key image.
Using Photoshop’s Auto Corrections
Adjusting the tonality of your image can be as simple as selecting one of the Auto 
commands from Photoshop’s Image menu. With many photos, the tonality (and 
even the color) jump to just the right look for your image. No muss, no fuss — just 
a great-looking picture with a single command. Auto Color usually does the best 
job for most images that are close-but-not-perfect. If you don’t like the result, 
simply use Undo and use one of Photoshop’s more powerful tools.
Although Auto Color (and, to a lesser extent, Auto Tone and Auto Contrast) might 
do a good job with images that need simple corrections, take an extra few seconds 
and try the Auto buttons in Levels and Curves. On the Image ➪ Adjustments menu, 
choose Levels or Curves and click the Auto button, and the algorithm will search 
for an adjustment that, when applied, improves both brightness and contrast in 
all three channels in an RGB image.
If, for some reason, you prefer one of the other algorithms for Levels and Curves, 
open either dialog box, click the Options button, select your desired algorithm, 
and then click OK (see Figure 6-5).
FIGURE 6-4: 
Too many pixels in the leftmost column make 
the distribution for the midtones hard to see.

CHAPTER 6  Making Tonality and Color Look Natural     95
Levels and Curves and You
Sometimes you need (or simply want) more control than what’s offered by the 
Auto commands. You might have a more demanding problem or a more expan-
sive artistic vision. You might need to make major corrections or create stupen-
dous effects. Photoshop, not surprisingly, offers that sort of control over your 
image. In fact (and also not surprisingly), you have several features at your dis-
posal to manipulate the tonality of your images. Two of the most commonly used 
are Levels and Curves, both found on the Adjustments menu at the bottom of the 
Layers panel (see Chapter 8), the Layer ➪ New Adjustment Layer menu, and the 
Image ➪ Adjustments menu.
You can also use the tonal adjustment tools in Camera Raw prior to opening the 
image into Photoshop. Camera Raw is also available as a filter for images that 
have already been opened into Photoshop. Using Camera Raw as a filter isn’t the 
same as using the plug-in on a Raw image. Read about working with Camera Raw 
in Chapter 7.
Before I introduce you to the Levels and Curves commands, let me quickly explain 
and dismiss a couple of other available options, one at the very top of the Adjust-
ments menu the other at the very bottom. Since the early days of Photoshop, 
the Brightness/Contrast command has lurked among the Image ➪ Adjustments 
commands. In fact, it was the image adjustment command way back when.  
FIGURE 6-5: 
The Enhance 
Brightness 
and Contrast 
algorithm is

default.

96     PART 2  Easy Enhancements for Digital Images
Now, however, the feature is somewhat lacking in control and sophistication and 
is perhaps of most use when fine-tuning an alpha channel or layer mask. (Alpha 
channels are discussed in Chapter 8, and layer masks appear in Chapter 10.) In 
both alpha channels and layer masks, you use a grayscale representation to iden-
tify specific areas of your image. Brightness/Contrast is perfectly adequate for 
many adjustments that you might make to those channels. Although its behavior 
is vastly improved from the early days, it is still a two-slider adjustment. But if 
you’re an old-timer and absolutely love that old-time behavior of the Brightness/ 
Contrast adjustment, click the Use Legacy check box to restore the older adjust-
ment performance.
Also of limited use is the Equalize adjustment. It finds the lightest pixel in the 
image and calls that white and also finds the darkest pixel and calls that black. 
The rest of the pixels in the image are distributed between those values, creating 
an extended tonal range. In practice, you’ll find that the adjustment results in 
extreme highlights and extreme shadows, with a rather garish image overall as 
well as a lack of details in the midtones.
Always keep in mind that you don’t have to make changes to the entire image. If 
only part of an image needs repair, make a selection of that area before opening 
the particular adjustment dialog box you want to use. (Read about making selec-
tions to isolate areas of your image in Chapter 8.) Say, for example, that you take 
a beautiful photo of a room in your house — “beautiful” except that the view out 
the window is far too bright. Isolate the window with a selection, and then use one 
of your image adjustment commands to tone it down.
Level-headed you!
The Image ➪ Adjustments ➪ Levels command (⌘  +L/Ctrl+L) or adding a Levels 
adjustment layer (discussed in Chapter 8) gives you control over shadows, high-
lights, and your image’s overall tonality individually. Using a slider with three 
controls, you adjust the picture both to suit your eye, and with an eye on a his-
togram for reference. You even have numeric fields in which you can type exact 
values, should you find the need.
To perform the basic Levels correction, spreading the image’s tonality over 
the full range of values available, simply drag the slider controls under the 
histogram in the Levels dialog box inward until they’re under the point where 
the histogram begins to rise in a mountain shape. Ignore those little flat tails that 
extend outward — they represent individual stray pixels — and drag the little 
pointers under columns that are at least a few pixels tall. The histogram in the 
Levels dialog box (as shown in Figure 6-6) is for reference as you make changes, 
showing changes to the overall luminosity of each pixel. Note, however, that while 
you work in Levels, the Histogram panel also updates, showing you the changes 
that will be made to each color channel.

DEFINING WHITE AND BLACK
The Options button in the Levels (and Curves) dialog box opens a door through which 
you might never need to walk. However, should your path lead you to that door, I want 
you to know what lies behind it. Neither pit nor tiger awaits you, only the possibility of 
controlling your highlights and shadows — or making a total mess of your image, of 
course. (Adobe does a good job of hiding those it-could-cost-me-a-fortune-if-I-screw-it-up 
features.) The Options button gives you control over the behavior of the Auto button in 
both Levels and Curves. (I suggest that you leave the algorithm set to Enhance Brightness 
and Contrast.) The Options button also lets you define what colors Photoshop should 
use for the lightest pixels and for the darkest pixels. The definition of black and white is 
not always black and white.
Generally speaking, if you print to an inkjet, you want the full tonal range of the printer, so 
you should leave white and black set to the extremes, as far apart as possible. However, 
if you’re creating gallery prints, you might want to change the definition of “white” from 
RGB 255/255/255 to RGB 245/245/245 to ensure that you produce 100 percent ink cov-
erage, with no paper showing through in the highlights. Instead of changing overall the 
definition of “white” and “black” when preparing a print, you can use a Levels adjustment 
or adjustment layer, setting the Output Levels slider in the lower right to 245.

98     PART 2  Easy Enhancements for Digital Images
Dragging the middle slider in Levels to the right moves the bulk of the histo-
gram toward the left, making the overall appearance of the image slightly darker. 
­Dragging the middle slider to the left lightens the overall image.
For good measure, note the Output Levels slider in Figure 6-6, which you gen-
erally use only when preparing an image for a gallery print or for a commercial 
printing press that requires you to compress the image’s tonal range. Otherwise, 
ignore Output Levels. And make a mental note of that pop-up menu at the top of 
the Levels dialog box — you can apply Levels to each color channel of your image 
individually, changing this tonal adjustment tool to a color correction feature.
When you’re working in Levels (or just about any dialog box), remember that 
holding down the Option/Alt key changes the Cancel button to Reset. When you 
click Reset, all values in the dialog box are restored to the defaults, letting you 
start over without having to cancel and reselect the command.
Earlier in this chapter, I mention that you can use the Histogram panel to avoid 
introducing problems into the image. Note in Figure 6-6 that the Histogram panel 
shows slight gaps appearing among the columns. Technically called posterization, 
these gaps represent tonal values that are being squished together into a single 
value. The pixels at one brightness level are being shifted to the next higher or the 
next lower value, leaving that empty column in the histogram. Is this a ­problem? 
No, as long as you don’t see wide gaps, representing a number of consecutive tonal 
values not in use. (Extensive posterization ruins the subtle transitions between 
colors in your image.) And that’s why you want to keep an eye on the Histogram 
panel — to make sure you’re not creating wide gaps in the histogram and notice-
able posterization in your image.
Posterization is rarely a problem with an image captured in (and processed in) 
16-bit color, such as a Raw photo brought into Photoshop through Camera Raw. 
If, however, you shoot JPEG (which requires 8-bit color), here’s an easy way to 
minimize that posterization, one that lets you make your Levels adjustment but 
keep a pretty histogram that doesn’t show posterization. Immediately after using 
Levels, choose Edit ➪ Fade Levels and change the blending mode from Normal to 
Luminosity. As you see in Figure 6-7, the posterization is greatly reduced with a 
minimal change in the effect of the Levels adjustment. Remember that the Fade 
command is available only immediately after applying an adjustment (or filter or 
tool) — you can’t even use the Save command between. (Read more about the 
Fade command in Chapter 15.)

CHAPTER 6  Making Tonality and Color Look Natural     99
Tonal corrections with the eyedroppers
The Levels dialog box (and the Curves dialog box, too) offers another way to make 
tonal corrections to your image — sort of a half-automated technique — using 
the three eyedroppers in the right side (Levels) or at the bottom (Curves) of the 
dialog box. (When adding an adjustment layer rather than the Adjustment com-
mands, the eyedroppers are to the left in the Properties panel.) Open your image, 
open the Levels dialog box, and correct both tonality and color in your image with 
three little clicks:
1.	 Click the left eyedropper on something that should be black.
This might be a shadow, a piece of clothing, or the tire of a car. Generally, you 
click something in the image that’s already quite dark.
2.	 Click the right eyedropper on something that should be white.
A cloud, the bride’s dress, perhaps an eye . . . all are likely targets for the 
highlight eyedropper. You usually click something that’s already quite light.
3.	 Click the middle eyedropper on something that should be gray.
Click something that should be neutral in color (should be, not already is). It 
doesn’t have to be mid-gray, just something that should be neutral. This 
reduces or eliminates any unwanted color cast (tint) in the image. If you don’t 
like the result, click somewhere else in the image. Keep clicking until the colors 
in the image look right.
In Figure 6-8, the shadow under the bridge, the splash of water, and the weath-
ered wood of the bridge itself provide excellent targets for the three eyedroppers.
FIGURE 6-7:

dialog box.

100     PART 2  Easy Enhancements for Digital Images
Here’s another way to adjust color using Levels. Duplicate the image layer by 
dragging it to the New Layer button at the bottom of the Layers panel and apply 
the Blur ➪ Average filter. The layer becomes a solid color. Open the Levels dialog 
box. Click in the layer with the middle eyedropper and click OK. Delete that blurred 
layer. This technique doesn’t work with every image (such as extremely bright, 
super-saturated images), but it does a great job on most.
Adjusting your curves without dieting
One step up from Levels in complexity, and about five steps ahead in terms of 
image control, is Image ➪ Adjustments ➪ Curves (⌘  +M/Ctrl+M). The Curves dia-
log box has a pair of slider controls (similar to the left and right sliders in Levels) 
to easily control the endpoints of your shadows and highlights. The curve line 
itself gives you control over various parts of the tonal range independently. Curves 
also offers eyedroppers for tonal and color correction. They’re used the same way 
you use the eyedroppers in Levels.
At the very beginning of this chapter, I show you how a simple tonal adjustment 
can add some drama and some interest to a rather bland image. Figure 6-9 shows 
the simple Curves adjustment that I applied to that image. Dragging the curve 
downward in the shadows makes them darker; dragging upward for the highlights 
makes them brighter. The midtones (that section of the tonal range between shad-
ows and highlights) have improved contrast using this adjustment.
When you first open the Curves dialog box or add a Curves adjustment layer, you 
see a graph with a diagonal line running from an anchor point in the lower-left 
corner to another in the upper-right corner. You can click and drag that line up 
or down (not sideways) to add anchor points and make changes in the curve (and 
in your image). By default, the shadows are in the lower-left corner, so dragging 
down will darken and dragging up will lighten. (In the Show Amount Of area, 
FIGURE 6-8: 
Use the 
eyedroppers 
in Levels to set 
the black and 
white points; 
then neutralize 
your image’s 
colors.

CHAPTER 6  Making Tonality and Color Look Natural     101
switching from Light to Pigment/Ink will reverse the shadows/highlights. Use 
this option when preparing CMYK images for page layout programs.) You can add 
more than a dozen anchor points to the curve — although you generally need only 
between one and three new points.
Most snapshots can benefit from a slight tweak in Curves. Click at the intersection 
of the first vertical and horizontal gridlines in the lower left (the three-quarter 
tones) and drag down slightly. The Input field should read 64, and the Output field 
should be somewhere between 55 and 60 for a shot that looks pretty good to start. 
Next, click at the intersection of the grid lines in the upper right (the quarter tones) 
and drag up slightly. The Input field should show 192, and the Output field can be 
anywhere from 195 to 205. This is called a basic S-curve.
Both the Curves and Levels dialog boxes offer you the Load and Save options using 
the gear-shaped button to the right of the Preset menu. If there’s a correction 
that you’ll use more than once or a correction that needs to be precise time after 
time, use Save. Then, later, you can click Load to apply that adjustment to another 
image. If, for example, you used the wrong setting in your camera while taking a 
series of shots all under the same lighting conditions, they probably all need the 
same correction. Make the adjustment once, save it, and then apply it to the other 
images with the Load button.
If you want to correct a specific area in the image, move the cursor into the image 
window (where it appears as the Eyedropper tool). Hold down the mouse button 
and you’ll see a circle on the curve, telling you where those pixels fall in the tonal 
range. To add an anchor point there, ⌘  +click/Ctrl+click in the image.
Curves offers the option to adjust the curve by clicking and dragging right in your 
image window. Activate the on-screen adjustment option by clicking the tool to 
FIGURE 6-9: 
A simple 
“S-curve” 
adjustment 
makes the

dramatic.

102     PART 2  Easy Enhancements for Digital Images
the lower left of the grid in the Curves dialog box (or to the upper left of the 
grid when adding a Curves adjustment through the Properties panel). With the 
on-screen adjustment option active, click in the image window on an area that 
needs improvement and drag upward to lighten or downward to darken. (See 
Figure 6-10.) The adjustment is applied to the entire image or selection, not just 
the area where you click. (Working with adjustments layers in the Properties panel 
is discussed in Chapter 8.)
When your curve has multiple anchor points, the active anchor point shows as a 
filled-in square. Deselected anchor points are hollow squares. For precision, you 
can use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move the active anchor point, or you 
can type specific values in the Input field (starting position for the anchor point) 
and Output field (where you want the anchor point to go).
Option+click/Alt+click in the grid area to toggle between a 4x4 grid and a 10x10 grid 
or use the two buttons in the Grid Size section to switch back and forth. And, rather 
than clicking and dragging on the curve, you can activate the Pencil tool and draw 
your curve by hand. When hand-drawing your curve, the Smooth button is avail-
able, too, to ensure that the transitions in your tonal adjustments aren’t too severe.
Grabbing Even More Control
The Image ➪ Adjustments menu in Photoshop includes a couple more extremely 
powerful ways to work with tonality in your images. You can use the Shadow/
Highlight adjustment to isolate and change whatever range of dark and light 
FIGURE 6-10: 
Drag up to 
lighten, down 
to darken. 
Adjustments 
are applied 
throughout the 
image.

CHAPTER 6  Making Tonality and Color Look Natural     103
pixels you want. By specifying what range of tonal values that you want to be 
­considered dark or light, you control how broadly or narrowly your change is 
applied. The Exposure feature lets you change the overall tonality of the image, 
much as if you’d taken the photo with a different camera setting. And don’t forget 
about making spot corrections with the Dodge and Burn tools!
The Image ➪ Adjustments ➪ HDR Toning command is designed — like the Expo-
sure adjustment — to be used with 32-bit/channel high-dynamic range images. 
You can read about HDR (and HDR Toning) in Chapter 20.
The Shadow/Highlight and Exposure adjustments are not the same as working 
with Raw images in the Camera Raw plug-in. (See Chapter 7.) Camera Raw works 
with unprocessed image data, the so-called digital negative. Using Photoshop’s 
Adjustment commands or using Camera Raw as a filter within Photoshop, you’re 
working with image data that has already been manipulated in the camera, in 
Photoshop, or both. When working with unprocessed data in Camera Raw, you 
truly have control over the exposure, the shadows, the highlights, and much more.
The Shadow/Highlight adjustment is not available as an adjustment layer. Changes 
that you make with the Shadow/Highlight command are a permanent part of your 
image. However, if you convert the layer to a Smart Object, Shadow/Highlight 
can be applied as a Smart Filter. (Smart Objects are introduced in Chapter 10, and 
Smart Filters are discussed in Chapter 15.)
Using Shadow/Highlight
The Shadow/Highlight adjustment is designed to rescue two specific sorts of 
images — you’ve seen them (and maybe taken them): The background is per-
fectly exposed, but the subject in the foreground is in horrible shadow. Or, equally 
bad, the background looks great, but the subject is washed out by a strong flash. 
(See both examples in Figure 6-11.) By controlling the shadows and highlights 
separately from the rest of the image, this feature helps you restore more balance 
to the image.
The default settings in Shadow/Highlight are intended to repair backlighting 
problems, as you see on the left in Figure 6-11. When the foreground lacks detail 
because of flash (as you can see in the top dog image on the right), minimize 
changes to the shadows and drag the Highlights slider to the right. And, as shown 
in Figure 6-12, with Show More Options selected, Shadows/Highlights gives you 
incredible control over images that have problems at both ends of the tonal range.

104     PART 2  Easy Enhancements for Digital Images
In the Shadows/Highlights dialog box, the Shadows slider lightens the darker 
areas of your image and the Highlights slider darkens the lighter areas. Gener-
ally, you’ll use one slider or the other to fix a specific problem in an image, but 
you can use both if you need to lighten shadows and tone down highlights in the 
same image.
When you enable the Show More Options check box, Shadow/Highlight has a 
rather intimidating set of controls. Not to worry! It’s actually pretty simple:
»
» Amount: For both Shadows and Highlights, the Amount slider is how much of 
a correction you’re making. This is the nuts and bolts of the Shadow/Highlight 
adjustment. For a backlit subject, you’ll use the Shadows slider a lot and not 
the Highlights slider. When working with a washed-out subject, you’ll probably 
move the Shadows slider to 0% and work with the Highlights slider.

»
» Tone: Use the Tone sliders to specify how much of the image’s tonal range 
you want to include as shadows or highlights. If you drag either Tone slider to 
100%, you’re working on the entire tonal range of the image — not a particu-
larly appropriate job for Shadow/Highlight. (Use Curves instead.) The default 
of 50% is rather too high most of the time. Instead, start your adjustment with 
a range of perhaps 20% and fine-tune from there.
»
» Radius: You adjust the Radius sliders to tell Shadow/Highlight which pixels 
should be identified as being in the shadow or highlight. With too low of a 
Radius setting, an individual black pixel stuck in the middle of a light area in 
your image might get classified as a shadow area. Too high of a setting has a 
tendency to apply the adjustment to the entire image. Generally speaking, 
start with a Radius of perhaps 10 pixels for very small images and 30 pixels for 
large digital photos. After adjusting your Amount and Tonal Width sliders, 
move the Radius slider back and forth while watching some of the smaller 
patches of shadow or highlight (whichever you’re correcting) to make sure 
that those areas are being included in the adjustment.
»
» Color/Brig: This slider changes its name to match your image’s color mode. 
When working with a color image, you see Color. When you apply Shadow/
Highlight to a grayscale image, the slider’s name changes to Brig (Brightness). 
Don’t use this slider until you make your Amount adjustment. In a color 
image, lightening the shadows or darkening the highlights shows the actual 
color of the pixels in those areas. Use this slider to increase (drag to the right) 
or decrease (drag to the left) the saturation of those pixels. Remember that 
Color slider works only on the pixels that you identify with the Tonal Width 
and Radius sliders. (If you set both sets of Tonal Width and Radius sliders to 
0%, Color Correction has no effect on the image at all.) When you correct a 
grayscale image, on the other hand, the Brightness slider affects all pixels 
except those that are already pure white or pure black.
»
» Midtone: You can increase or decrease the contrast throughout the image 
with the Midtone slider. Much like clicking in the middle of the curve in the 
Curves dialog box and dragging up or down, you adjust the whole range of 
your image, including the shadows and highlights. When the overall appear-
ance of your image needs improvement, start with Midtone and then work 
with your shadows and highlights individually.
»
» Clip: Most of the time, you don’t want to change the clipping values. Clipping 
takes pixels that are almost black and forces them to pure black, or it takes 
pixels that are almost white and forces them to pure white. Clipping your 
shadows or highlights reduces those subtle differences in color that provide 
the detail in the shadows and highlights. When would you want to clip 
shadows or highlights? When you don’t care about detail in those areas of 
your image and need more contrast through the midtones.

Changing exposure after the fact
Photoshop also offers the Exposure feature in the Image ➪ Adjustments menu. It 
simulates how the image would have looked if you changed the exposure setting 
on your camera before clicking the shutter. Think of it as an across-the-board 
adjustment of tonality in the image or within a selection in the image. The Offset 
and Gamma Correction sliders are designed primarily to work with very high-bit 
images (the special 32-bit/channel high-dynamic-range images), and you likely 
will find them too sensitive to be of much use for most images.
Exposure is a rather specialized tool, and you probably won’t find it nearly as user 
friendly or effective as Curves and Shadow/Highlight. If you do actually work with 
32-bit/channel images, take it for a test drive; you might decide that it fills a need.
Using Photoshop’s toning tools
You have a couple more ways to work with tonality in Photoshop — the toning 
tools. These two brush-using tools let you paint corrections on your image, giving 
you incredible control over the appearance. Select the Burn tool to darken or the  
Dodge tool to lighten. Select a brush tip on the Options bar and drag the tool in your 
image to apply the correction. (You can read about controlling the brush-using 
tools and that incredibly powerful Brush panel in Chapter  14.) In Figure  6-13,  
you see the Burn tool darkening a specific area of the fence on the right.
The Dodge tool is great for minimizing (without removing) shadows in an image. 
You’ll find it particularly useful for reducing wrinkles in faces and other such 
jobs that require lightening specific areas of an image. Figure 6-14 compares the 
original (left) with a working copy in which I’m using the Dodge tool to reduce the 
FIGURE 6-13: 
“Painting” the 
fence with 
the Burn tool 
to darken 
the rails.

CHAPTER 6  Making Tonality and Color Look Natural     107
appearance of the wrinkles. By reducing rather than eliminating those wrinkles 
completely, I retain the character of the man’s face as well as prevent that phony, 
just-out-of-plastic-surgery look.
In almost all circumstances when working with the Dodge and Burn tools, you 
should activate the Protect Tones option on the Options bar. With this option 
selected, the tools do a much better job of protecting color and retaining detail in 
shadows and highlights. To the right on the Options bar is a button you can use to 
enable pressure sensitivity when you’re working with a Wacom tablet, overriding 
any pressure-sensitivity setting in the Brush panel.
For most of the work that you do with the Dodge and Burn tools, the default Expo-
sure setting of 50% is way too strong. In the Options bar, reduce the Exposure to 
about 15–20% for most work. And unless you’re specifically working on lighten-
ing shadows or toning down highlights, set the tools’ Range to Midtones in the 
Options bar.
What Is Color in Photoshop?
In the end (and the middle and the beginning), your image in Photoshop is noth-
ing but little squares of color. Each square — each pixel — can be exactly one 
color. Which color for which square is up to you. I’ll say it again: There is no car 
or circle or tree or Uncle Bob in your Photoshop image — just a bunch of little 
squares of color.
Photoshop works with digital images  — including digital photos, images that 
have been digitized with a scanner, and artwork that you create from scratch in 
Photoshop. The digits are the computer code used to record the image’s informa-
tion. The number of pixels, the color of each pixel, and any associated information 
are all recorded in a series of zeros and ones on your hard drive. Color, therefore, 
is nothing more than numbers — at least as far as Photoshop and your computer 
FIGURE 6-14: 
Use the 
Dodge tool

wrinkles

them.

108     PART 2  Easy Enhancements for Digital Images
are concerned. For you and me, however, color is far more than binary code on a 
hard drive. It’s the image, the artwork, the message. The artwork is the color, and 
color is the artwork, pixel by pixel.
Photoshop records the color of each pixel in your image in any of several differ-
ent ways. Every pixel in any given image has all color recorded in a single color 
mode, which is the actual color format for the image file. While working with your 
image, however, you can define specific colors in any of a variety of color models, 
which are sort of the formula or recipes with which you mix color. And an image 
can have only one color depth, which is the limitation on the number of colors in 
an image.
Before I get into too many details, you need to understand one of the basic con-
cepts of color: gamut. Consider gamut to be the range of colors that can be theo-
retically reproduced in a specific color mode or with a specific color profile. A 
wide gamut, therefore, has many more colors available than does a limited gamut. 
Those extra colors are generally the brighter, more vibrant colors . . . the ones that 
make an image come alive. The red/green/blue (RGB) color mode generally offers 
you a wider range of colors than does cyan/magenta/yellow/black (CMYK). See, 
for example, the comparison in Figure 6-15, paying particular attention to the 
purples, oranges, and yellows. And keep in mind that the specific color profile (the 
working space that you select; see Chapter 4) also has an impact on the colors in 
your image.

image (on the

gamut.

CHAPTER 6  Making Tonality and Color Look Natural     109
Which color mode should you choose?
If you’ll be printing to an inkjet printer, sending photos to a lab for prints, or 
posting your image on the web, you need RGB color mode. (Despite the CMYK inks 
that you load into your inkjet printer, the printer’s software expects and must 
receive RGB color data.) If you’re prepping an image for inclusion in an InDesign 
document destined for a commercial offset press, you need CMYK. You select the 
image’s color mode from the Image ➪ Mode menu. That’s the simple summary. 
Here’s a bit more detail, presented in the order in which you’re likely to need the 
various color modes:
»
» RGB: RGB is the color mode for digital photos, computer monitors, the World 
Wide Web, and inkjet printers. All colors are recorded as proportions of the 
three component colors: red, green, and blue. RGB color is recorded in the 
three color channels (described a bit later in this chapter). RGB is an additive 
color mode — that is, the more of each component color you add, the closer 
you get to white.
»
» CMYK: CMYK is used primarily for 
printing on a commercial offset 
press, but you might need it for a 
color laser printer or a high-end 
inkjet printer with which you use a 
RIP (raster image processor, which is 
a specialized bit of hardware or 
software that lets your inkjet 
pretend it’s a printing press). CMYK 
is the color mode of magazines, 
books, and other mass-produced 
printed material, such as the 
example in Figure 6-16. CMYK is a 
subtractive color mode — that is, 
the less of each component color 
you have, the closer you are to white (or the color of the paper on which 
you’re printing).
»
» Grayscale: When most people talk about a black-and-white photo, they really 
mean grayscale. The image does contain black and white but also a wide 
range of grays in between. You might use grayscale mode for web-based 
images or for prints. Keep in mind that unless your inkjet printer is designed 
to reproduce grayscale images with black and gray inks (or black and light-
black inks), you probably won’t be happy with grayscale output. Using just one 
black ink doesn’t reproduce the full range of grays in the image. Using the 
color inks adds a tint to the image. You do have an alternative for grayscale 
images: Send them to the local photo lab for printing.
FIGURE 6-16: 
You typically use CMYK images for bulk-print 
materials.

110     PART 2  Easy Enhancements for Digital Images
»
» Indexed Color: Using a color table, or a list of up to 256 specific colors, 
Indexed Color mode is for the web. You save GIF and PNG-8 images in 
Indexed Color, but only those file formats require such a limited number of 
colors. Things like buttons on your web page, which need only a couple of 
colors, should be created as GIFs using Indexed Color mode. That keeps the 
file size down, reducing the amount of space the image requires on your web 
server and also speeding the download time (how long it takes for the image to 
appear on your site-visitor’s monitor).
»
» Lab: Also known as L*a*b and CIELAB (and pronounced either lab, as the dog 
or a research facility, or verbally spelled out, as el-ay-be), this is a color mode 
that you might use when producing certain special effects or using certain 
techniques in Photoshop, but it’s not one in which you’ll save your final 
artwork. The three channels in a (or “an”) Lab image are
•	 Lightness, which records the brightness of each pixel
•	 a, which records the color of the pixel on a green-to-red axis
•	 b, which records each pixel’s color value on a blue-to-yellow axis
You shouldn’t try to print Lab images on an inkjet or post them on your 
website. You might see (not in this book!) a tip that you should convert your 
RGB or CMYK images to Lab mode before using one of Photoshop’s Sharpen 
filters. Bah! Apply the Sharpen filter, choose Edit ➪ Fade Unsharp Mask (or 
Fade Smart Sharpen — the Fade command changes its name to match the 
last-used filter, adjustment, or tool), and change the blending mode from 
Normal to Luminosity. Same result, less work, and less potential for degrada-
tion of your image.
»
» Duotone: Duotone (including tritone and quadtone) is a very specialized color 
mode, exclusively for commercial printing, that uses only two (or three or 
four) inks spread throughout your image. Although that might sound good for 
an inkjet printer, in fact, Duotone is not an acceptable color mode for inkjets. 
Duotone images require that specific premixed inks are poured into the 
printing presses, which isn’t something that you can do to your inkjet.
»
» Multichannel: Like Duotone, the Multichannel color mode is restricted to 
commercial printing because it depends on specific premixed colors of ink 
that are applied to the paper. Unlike Duotone, in which the inks are generally 
spread across the page, Multichannel images use certain inks in certain areas. 
You might need Multichannel mode when creating a logo for a client.
»
» Bitmap: Bitmap color mode is true black and white (as you see in Figure 6-17). 
Each pixel is either black or white. The placement of the black and white pixels 
produces shading, but the image doesn’t really have any gray pixels. You 
might use Bitmap mode to create images for some wireless devices, use on 
the web, or commercial print, but that’s about it.

CHAPTER 6  Making Tonality and Color Look Natural     111
Converting between color modes or gamuts 
(done with the Image ➪ Mode menu) can 
reduce the quality of your image by com-
pressing variations of a color into a single 
color value. You would not, for example, want 
to convert from RGB (which has a compara-
tively large number of colors available) to 
CMYK (with a more restricted color gamut) 
and then back to RGB. After colors are com-
pressed by a conversion, you can’t restore 
their original values by converting back to a 
wider gamut.
Does a color model make a difference?
Although the image itself has a single color mode, you can use any of the available 
color models when defining a color in Photoshop. Say, for example, that you’re 
preparing to use the Brush tool to paint some artistic elements for your latest 
project. The project is in RGB mode because you’ll be printing it with your inkjet 
printer. You can use the Color panel to define your foreground color any way you 
please — RGB, CMYK, Grayscale, Lab, or even HSB (hue/saturation/brightness, 
which isn’t available as a color mode, just a color model). It doesn’t matter how 
you set up the Color panel, which you do through the panel’s menu, as shown in 
Figure 6-18. When you add the color to your image, Photoshop uses the nearest 
RGB (or CMYK) equivalent.
FIGURE 6-17: 
Bitmap images contain only black and 
white pixels; no grays, no colors.
FIGURE 6-18:

preferred color 
model from

menu.

112     PART 2  Easy Enhancements for Digital Images
Notice that the Color panel menu in Figure  6-18 doesn’t list Duotone or 
Multichannel. Those are color modes only, not color models. A couple of other 
things to note about working with the Color panel: The warning triangle visible in 
Figure 6-18 in the lower-left corner of the panel indicates that the selected color 
is outside the CMYK color gamut. Clicking the swatch to the right of the triangle 
would select the nearest equivalent color (if, that is, you were actually working 
in CMYK mode). Also note that the foreground swatch is selected in the panel, 
highlighted with a black outline — click the background swatch to make changes 
to the background color.
You can also select or define a color using the Color Picker, which you open 
by clicking the foreground or background color swatches near the bottom of 
the Toolbox or in the Color panel. The Color Picker is explained in detail in 
Chapter 14.
Why should you worry about color depth?
Color depth is the actual number of different colors that you have available. 
(Remember that each pixel can be only one color at any time.) When you work in 
8-bit-per-channel color, simply called 8-bit color, each of the component colors is 
recorded with exactly 8 bits of information per pixel in the computer file. (At the 
beginning of this section, I mention digits. These are the actual numbers — the 
zeros and ones recorded on the hard drive to track each pixel’s color.) In an 8-bit 
RGB image, each pixel’s color is recorded with three strings of eight characters. 
When you work with 16-bit-per-channel, or 16-bit color, each of the component 
colors is recorded with 16 digits. The larger numbers mean more possible ways to 
record each color, which means more possible variations of color (as well as files 
that take up more space on your hard drive).
What that means to you, in practical terms, is possibly a better-looking image 
when working in 16-bit color. You’ll have smoother transitions between colors 
throughout your image, no banding in gradients (those annoying areas in a gradi-
ent where you can actually see one shade of a color stop and the next shade of that 
color start), and no splotchy shadows. Posterization, which I explain earlier in this 
chapter, is the degradation of your image’s appearance when similar colors are 
forced to the same color, making transitions between colors more abrupt. Many 
tonal and color corrections that produce posterization in your 8-bit images won’t 
harm a 16-bit image in the least. Take a look at Figure 6-19. To the left, the His-
togram panel shows the result of a Levels adjustment for a 16-bit image. When the 
same adjustment is applied to an 8-bit version of the image, posterization becomes 
visible in the Histogram panel (represented by the gaps in the histogram).

CHAPTER 6  Making Tonality and Color Look Natural     113
Some of the top inkjet printers, when printing on a Mac, can process and use 
16-bit color — but unless Photoshop’s Print dialog box offers the Send 16-Bit 
Data option (shown in Figure 6-19), you won’t be using more than 8 bits of 
color data.
So, should you use 16-bit color all the time? No. You can’t post a 16-bit image on 
the web, and 16-bit color is rarely used for CMYK images. Digital photos taken in 
JPEG format are 8-bit because that file format doesn’t support 16-bit color. And 
unless you’re using a 16-bit-capable inkjet printer, you won’t see any improve-
ment in the final print. If you shoot in 16-bit color, typically using a Raw file 
format, it makes sense to keep the image in 16-bit color. Do all the processing in 
16-bit color, save the file as a 16-bit image, and send the 16-bit data to your ink-
jet printer. If you’ll be sending the file off to a print lab or eventually posting the 
image on a website, create a copy of the file and convert the copy to 8-bit/channel 
color through the Image ➪ Mode menu.
FIGURE 6-19:

Histogram 
panels to see 
posterization 
(right).

114     PART 2  Easy Enhancements for Digital Images
You might consider converting an 8-bit image to 16-bit color as part of a larger 
project, perhaps one that includes a large gradient as part of the artwork. But, 
generally speaking, if the image was captured in 8-bit color, keep it in 8-bit color; 
if the image was captured in 16-bit color, keep it in 16-bit color.
One other note on color depth: Photoshop can work with 32-bit/channel images. 
These monstrous files are called high dynamic range (HDR) images and are typi-
cally constructed by combining different exposures of the same photo. Chapter 20 
takes a look at HDR.
Making Color Adjustments in Photoshop
Sometimes you have an image that needs some help in the color department. It 
might have been shot with an incorrect camera setting, it might have a color cast 
(an unwanted tint of a specific color), or it might just be dull and dingy. Photoshop 
provides you with an incredible array of commands and tools to make the colors 
in your images look just right. You’ll hear the term color correction being tossed 
about, but not all images have incorrect color. Some have very good color that can 
be great color. Instead of color correction, I like to think in terms of color improve-
ment. And just about every image can use a little tweaking to improve its color.
How do you know when the color is right? Your primary tool for the job is in your 
head. Literally. Make your decisions based primarily on what your eyes tell you. 
Sure, you can check the Info panel and the Histogram panel to make sure that your 
shadows are black and your highlights are white, but adjust your images until they 
look good to you — until you’re satisfied with the color.
That little symbol to the left of this paragraph is a little scary, but it does get  
your attention, doesn’t it? This isn’t a your-computer-will-blow-up sort of 
warning but more of a you-don’t-want-to-waste-your-time-and-effort warn-
ing. Do your tonal adjustments before you start working with the image’s colors. 
Go through the procedures in the first part of this chapter first and then use the 
techniques here. Why? If you get perfect hue and saturation and then start making 
tonal adjustments, you’re likely to knock your colors out of whack again. And, of 
course, there’s also the possibility that adjusting your image’s tonality will make 
the colors look perfect!

CHAPTER 6  Making Tonality and Color Look Natural     115
“HERE, SPOT!”: WHAT IS A SPOT COLOR?
Spot colors in your image are printed using premixed inks of exactly that color. (I’m talk-
ing commercial printing press here, not your run-of-the-mill inkjet printer.) To properly 
prepare a spot color for press, it needs to be in its own spot channel, which is a separate 
color channel in which you show where and how the ink will be applied. (Channels in 
your image are eventually used to create the actual printing plates that pick up ink and 
put it on paper.) Because spot channels are used with CMYK images, dark represents 
more. Where you need the spot color at 100% strength, the spot channel should be 
black. In areas where you want only a light tint of the spot color, use a light gray.
You create your spot channel by selecting the Spot Channel command from the Channels 
panel menu. Click the color swatch in the New Spot Channel dialog box to open the color 
libraries. (If you see the regular Color Picker, click the Color Libraries button.) Select the 
appropriate book (collection of colors; see the figure here) for your project, and then 
select your color. Click OK in the New Spot Channel dialog box to accept the color, do not 
change the name of the spot channel, and then click OK. You can now paint, fill, or copy/
paste into that new channel.
When saving images with spot channels, you can use the PSD file format (if the image 
will be placed into an InDesign document), PDF, TIFF, or DCS 2.0. Check with the person 
handling the layout or the print shop to see which is required.

116     PART 2  Easy Enhancements for Digital Images
Choosing color adjustment commands
Photoshop offers almost two dozen different commands that you can use to 
improve the appearance of your images, all of which are easily accessed through 
the Image ➪ Adjustments menu (as you see in Figure 6-20). Some have special-
ized purposes, and some are extremely versatile, but all are worth understanding 
so that you choose the most appropriate feature for the problem staring at you 
from the screen. Most (but not all) of the commands that I discuss here can be 
added to your images as an adjustment layer, which gives you added flexibility. 
(Adjustment layers are discussed in detail in Chapter 8.)
In addition to the Adjustment commands and adjustment layers, you can also take 
advantage of the color adjustment features of Camera Raw. If shooting Raw, you 
can open the image directly into Camera Raw, or after the image has been opened 
in Photoshop, you can use the Camera Raw filter. (See Chapter 7 for information 
about working with Camera Raw.)
Brightness/Contrast, Levels, Curves, Exposure
These commands are generally used to work with tonality rather than color (dis-
cussed earlier in this chapter). However, you can select an individual channel in 
Levels or Curves, as shown in Figure 6-21, to adjust color in an image. Keep in 
mind that changes to an individual color channel are reflected throughout all col-
ors in an image.
FIGURE 6-20: 
Photoshop’s 
flexibility is 
truly evident 
on the Image ➪  
Adjustments 
menu.

CHAPTER 6  Making Tonality and Color Look Natural     117
Vibrance
The Vibrance adjustment gives you control over both vibrance (the saturation 
of near-neutral colors) and saturation (the saturation of colors throughout the 
image). You can increase Vibrance to make the near-neutral colors more saturated, 
or you can reduce Vibrance to make those colors even more neutral, while increas-
ing Saturation to make the brighter colors in your image stand out even more.
Hue/Saturation
Often overlooked and rarely exploited to the fullest, Hue/Saturation is a very pow-
erful tool. Using the three sliders together, you can adjust the hue to eliminate a 
color cast, increase saturation so that your colors appear richer and more vibrant, 
and adjust lightness to improve your image’s tonality. (See Figure 6-22.) Keep in 
mind that when you adjust something that’s very dark, start with the Lightness 
slider so that you can evaluate the other changes (Hue and Saturation) properly. 
Remember, too, that you can apply Hue/Saturation (like a number of other adjust-
ments) to a specific range of colors in the image, selected in the pop-up menu 
at the top of the dialog box or at the top of the Properties panel when adding an 
adjustment layer.
FIGURE 6-21:

118     PART 2  Easy Enhancements for Digital Images
Using the pop-up menu (shown with the default Master visible in Figure 6-22), 
you can elect to apply an adjustment to only a certain part of the color in your 
image. After a color is selected, the eyedroppers become active, to add to or sub-
tract from the range of color being adjusted, and sliders become active between 
the gradients at the bottom, giving you yet another way to control the range of 
color being adjusted.
Visible in Figure 6-22 are the Adjustments and Properties panels, which you use 
to add adjustment layers to your images. Select the type of adjustment in the 
Adjustments panel, or in the menu at the bottom of the Layers panel, or through the 
Layer ➪ New Adjustments Layer menu. Make the actual adjustment in the Properties 
panel. (Adjustment layers are discussed in more detail in Chapter 8.) The content 
of the Properties panel offers the same options as the Image ➪ Adjustments ➪ Hue/ 
Saturation dialog box, but the Preview check box is replaced by the eyeball icon you 
see at the bottom of the panel in Figure 6-22 (the second icon from the left), which 
toggles the visibility of the new adjustment layer on and off. Use the Adjustments 
panel to add adjustment layers for the 16 commands you saw in the top three 
sections of the Adjustments menu (refer to Figure 6-20).
Color Balance
The Color Balance command presents you with three sliders that you use to make 
changes to the balance between your color opposites. If the image is too blue, you 
drag the third slider away from Blue and toward Yellow. (This is also a great way 
to remember which colors are opposite pairs!)
FIGURE 6-22: 
Hue/Saturation 
can cure three 
problems at 
once.

CHAPTER 6  Making Tonality and Color Look Natural     119
You can control the highlights, midtones, and shadows of your image individually 
by using radio buttons in the Color Balance dialog box and the Adjustments panel. 
And, in almost all cases, you’ll want to leave the Preserve Luminosity check box 
marked so that the brightness of the individual pixels is retained.
You can also use Color Balance to throw an image out of whack for special effects 
or (getting back to the adjustment’s roots) compensating for a color cast being 
introduced by the printing device.
Black & White
The Black & White adjustment creates outstanding grayscale copies of your color 
images. As you can see in Figure 6-23, you can control the amount of each major 
range of color used to create the grayscale copy. In this particular example, the 
original consists primarily of greens and browns, so the top three sliders are 
key. Reducing Reds and increasing Yellows both lighten the browns and greens 
and increases contrast among the brown tones. When adding a Black & White 
adjustment layer, you have an on-screen adjustment tool available, which you click  
in the image and drag up or down to adjust the brightness of a color throughout 
the image.
Note the Tint check box, with which you can easily create sepia or Duotone looks 
for your images. Click the color swatch to the right of Tint to open the Color 
Picker to select a specific tint. If you’ll be printing on an inkjet printer (rather than 
sending the file to your photo lab), you’ll want to use a Black & White adjustment 
layer rather than the menu command. Your inkjet printer may introduce an 
unwanted color shift. If so, you can reopen the adjustment layer and work with 
the sliders to compensate. Keep in mind that the Black & White adjustment you 
open through the Image ➪ Adjustments menu offers Hue and Saturation sliders 
when adding a tint.

Photo Filter
Photoshop’s Photo Filter is actually an image adjustment rather than a filter. The 
filter in the name refers to those physical photographic filters that you screw 
onto the end of a lens. This adjustment is a great way to correct problems with 
temperature in an image — the perceived warmth or coldness of an image. When 
the camera takes a picture under unexpected lighting conditions, a color problem 
is apparent. (Say, for example, that the camera is set to Daylight when shooting 
indoors.) When an image is too blue, it’s too cool; conversely, an image that’s 
orangey is too warm. (Remember that these are perceptual evaluations — blue 
light is technically hotter than yellow or red light.)
Channel Mixer
Designed to repair a defective channel in an image, Channel Mixer lets you use 
sliders to replace some of (or all of) the intensity of one color channel with content 
from the others. Should you come across an image with damage in one channel, 
you can certainly use the Channel Mixer adjustment to work on it (with some 
degree of success). You reduce the value of the target channel by dragging the 
slider to the left. You then drag one or both of the other sliders toward the right. 
Generally speaking, you want to add an amount (combined between the two other 
channels) just about equal to what you subtract from the target channel.
If you drag a slider to the left past 0 (zero), you invert the content of the channel. 
You can produce some incredible (and incredibly weird) effects with this tech-
nique, partially inverting one or two channels. When you get a chance, give it a 
try. Using the Monochrome check box in Channel Mixer gives you an alternative 
to the Black & White adjustment for a controlled grayscale effect.
Color Lookup
A color lookup table is, at its most basic, a formula for applying color changes. 
Color Lookup takes the image’s original colors and maps them to new colors based 
on the table you select in the dialog box. (See Figure 6-24.) Typically used with 
video, it may have some applicability to your work (depending on what lookup 
tables — “LUTs” — you find online). The “3D” in “3DLUT,” by the way, refers to 
three color channels (RGB) and has nothing to do with 3D objects.
Invert
More creative than corrective, the Invert command (no dialog box) simply reverses 
the colors in your image or the selected area. Although inverting areas of an image 
(like desaturating) can draw attention to the subject of the image, it’s an edgier 
technique and generally requires touch-up after inverting. You’ll find that any 
specular highlight — a pure-white area (mainly reflections) — becomes a dis-
tracting black spot.

CHAPTER 6  Making Tonality and Color Look Natural     121
Posterize
The Posterize command forces your image’s broad range of colors into a few 
selected colors. You automatically get black and white, and then a limited number 
of additional colors, based on the content of the original. You pick the number of 
colors that you want to use, and Photoshop picks which colors to use. You can use 
as few as two colors (plus black and white) or as many as 255, which pretty much 
gives you your original image. Posterize can create a rather pleasing rendering of 
a photo with very few colors.
When experimenting with Posterize, click in the Levels field and use the up- and 
down-arrow keys to preview different numbers of colors. Start low and work your 
way up. If you see something that you like, you can stop or you can keep going and 
come back to that number later — the image will look exactly the same when you 
try that number again.
Threshold
Threshold converts each pixel to either black or white (no colors, no grays). You 
adjust the border between black and white with a slider or by entering a value in 
the Threshold Level box. For an eye-catching special effect, open a color image 
and make a selection of the background (or the subject!) and apply Threshold, 
mixing color and black and white.

122     PART 2  Easy Enhancements for Digital Images
Sometimes, when adjusting color in an image, you need to find the darkest and 
lightest pixels in an image (for use with the eyedroppers in the Curves dialog box, 
for example). Open Threshold, drag the slider all the way to the left and then 
slowly back to the right. The first black spot you see is the darkest in the image. 
Add a color sampler (so you can find the spot again) by Shift+clicking in the image. 
Drag the slider all the way to the right and then slowly back to the left to find and 
mark the lightest pixels. After placing your color samplers, click Cancel.
Gradient Map
Again, more creative than corrective, the Gradient Map feature re-creates your 
image by using a gradient. The leftmost color stop (the anchor points where a gra-
dient color is assigned) in the gradient is mapped to the shadows the right-most 
to the highlights, and any color stops in between are appropriately assigned to 
the rest of the tonal range. In Figure 6-25, you can see how a two-color gradient 
(upper left) lacks detail compared with the four-color gradient being created for 
the lower image.
Generally speaking, you use darker colors for the color stops on the left and lighter 
colors for the color stops on the right (although you can create extremely inter-
esting effects by mixing things up). Using a black-to-white gradient produces a 
grayscale image.
FIGURE 6-25: 
Using more 
colors in 
your gradient 
produces more

CHAPTER 6  Making Tonality and Color Look Natural     123
To edit the gradient, simply click directly on the sample gradient in the Gradi-
ent Map dialog box. Click to add color stops, drag to move color stops, and click 
the color swatch near the bottom to change the color of the selected stop. (You 
can find more detailed information on creating and working with gradients in 
Chapter 14.)
Selective Color
Although designed to help you compensate for the vagaries of printing presses, 
Selective Color can do other great things for you! The command’s dialog box, 
shown in Figure 6-26, has a pop-up menu that offers the six basic colors of Pho-
toshop, as well as Whites, Neutrals, and Blacks. You select which range of colors 
to adjust and then drag the sliders. You can work on one set of colors, switch to 
another and make adjustments, switch to another, and so on without having to 
click OK in between. For example, you can adjust the reds in the image and leave 
the blues untouched, or you can adjust the reds and then tweak the blues without 
having to exit the dialog box.
When you have reasonably small adjustments to make and are using the Selective 
Color adjustment (or as an adjustment layer), select the Relative radio button at 
the bottom. If you have substantial changes — rather radical alterations — select 
the Absolute radio button.
Shadow/Highlight
The Shadow/Highlight adjustment is discussed at length earlier in this chapter as 
a tonal-correction tool, the job for which it was designed. However, keep in mind 
FIGURE 6-26: 
Tweaking 
the Neutrals 
can adjust 
the overall 
appearance of 
an image.

124     PART 2  Easy Enhancements for Digital Images
that the Shadow/Highlight dialog box also includes the Color Correction slider. 
After you lighten shadows or tone down highlights, you can increase or decrease 
the saturation of the colors in the adjusted areas of your image with the Color 
Correction slider.
HDR Toning
Designed for use with high dynamic range images (32-bits/channel), the HDR 
Toning adjustment provides a different way to adjust color. It can be used with 
flattened images in 8-bit or 16-bit color, but keep in mind that small adjustments 
are usually required. HDR Toning is examined in Chapter 20.
Desaturate
The Photoshop Desaturate command creates a grayscale representation of a color 
image without changing the color mode. However, with no dialog box or adjust-
ments, it doesn’t offer the control you get by using a Black & White adjustment.
Match Color
Now this is a feature to savor! There you are, adding Cousin Joe to the family 
reunion photo because he wasn’t bailed out in time, and you see that the lighting 
is all kinds of different and he sticks out like a sore thumb (or bum). Or you return 
from a major shoot only to find that something wasn’t set correctly in the camera, 
and all your images have a nasty color cast.
Match Color lets you adjust one image to another (and you can even use selections 
to identify areas to adjust or areas of the images to use as the basis for adjust-
ment), but keep in mind that you get better results with images that are already 
rather similar. You can also fix one shot and use that shot as a standard by which 
others are corrected. (Like most image adjustments, you can record a change in an 
Action and use Photoshop’s Batch command to apply that adjustment to a series 
of images. Read more about Actions and the Batch command in Chapter 16.) Take 
a look at Figure 6-27 to see the Match Color dialog box.
Because Match Color is such a powerful tool, it’s worth taking a look at what’s 
going on in the dialog box:
»
» Ignore Selection when Applying Adjustment: If you have an active selection 
in the target layer or image (for calculating the adjustment; see the upcoming 
bullet on that) and you want the adjustment to be applied to the entire target, 
select this check box. If the box is left clear, the adjustment is applied only 
within the selection. Note that you can use selections to apply Match Color to 
only a portion of your image, such as flesh tones, or you can adjust sections of 
the image one at a time.

CHAPTER 6  Making Tonality and Color Look Natural     125
»
» Luminance: After the preview shows in your image window, you can tone 
down or brighten up the target area with the Luminance slider.
»
» Color Intensity: Think of this slider as a saturation adjustment.
»
» Fade: Using Fade lets you blend the adjustment, reducing its intensity.
»
» Neutralize: If a color cast is introduced by the adjustment, selecting the 
Neutralize check box often eliminates it.
»
» Use Selection in Source to Calculate Colors: You can make a selection in the 
image to which you’re trying to match (the source) and use the colors within 
that selection as the basis for the Match Color calculation.
»
» Use Selection in Target to Calculate Adjustment: You can make another 
selection in the target layer or image that presents Match Color with a sample 
of those pixels to use for calculating the adjustment.
»
» Source: The Source pop-up menu lists all the open images that can be used 
as a basis for adjustment. Only images of the same color mode and color 
depth get listed. Think of source as the image whose colors you’re trying to 
match. (The selected image or the active layer within an image is what you’re 
adjusting.)
»
» Layer: When a multilayer image is selected in the Source pop-up menu, you 
can designate which layer (or a merged copy of the layers) is the actual 
source.
FIGURE 6-27: 
The small 
image to the 
upper right 
shows the 
results of using

126     PART 2  Easy Enhancements for Digital Images
»
» Load Statistics/Save Statistics: If you’re doing a series of images and you 
want to speed things up, click the Save Statistics button to record the adjust-
ment you’re making and then click the Load Statistics button with other 
images.
In Figure 6-27, an area of water is selected in the target image and a comparable 
area of water is selected in the source image. (The selection in the source image 
is visible in Figure 6-27 for illustrative purposes only — a selection in an inactive 
image window isn’t normally visible.) With the two selections, I tell Match Color 
to adjust the target image based on the difference between the water color in the 
two images. Using selections prevents any skewing of the adjustment that would 
be caused by the colors in the sail (source image) and the trees (target image). 
But with the Ignore Selection When Applying Adjustment check box enabled as 
well, I make sure the entire target image is adjusted, not just the areas within the 
selection.
Replace Color
Sort of a cross between the Select ➪ Color Range command (see Chapter 8) and 
the Hue/Saturation adjustment, Replace Color is an outstanding tool for swapping 
out one color for another. It’s truly great in a production environment where, for 
example, a certain blouse is available in several colors. Shoot one color and then 
use Replace Color to produce the additional product shots.
The Replace Color dialog box, as shown in Figure 6-28, has two separate parts: 
Selection and Replacement. Click with the left eyedropper in either the preview 
area or in the image windows and adjust the Fuzziness slider (how much variation 
counts as “selected”) to make your initial selection. Use the middle eyedropper to 
add colors or shades of your initial color, and use the right eyedropper to subtract 
from the selection. Choose only variations of one color. Then drag those Hue, 
Saturation, and Lightness sliders in the Replacement section of the dialog box to 
produce your new look.
Rather than switching eyedroppers back and forth, use the left eyedropper and 
the Shift key (to add) or the Option/Alt key (to subtract). You can also hold down 
the Shift key and drag through an area to select all the colors in the area. If you 
accidentally select some colors you don’t want, release the Shift key and click once 
to start over.
When the Localized Color Clusters option (at the top of the Replace Color dialog 
box) is active, Replace Color looks at each range of color you add to the selection 
as a separate entity. This enables much better technical control over the colors 
selected, but may not be appropriate for most uses of Replace Color, in which you 
generally want smooth and complete transformation of all of the selected colors.

CHAPTER 6  Making Tonality and Color Look Natural     127
Equalize
When you select the Equalize adjustment, Photoshop finds the darkest pixel in the 
image and maps it to black, maps the lightest pixel to white, and distributes the 
rest of the tonal values between. You can pretty much skip Equalize — use Auto 
Color or — even better — the Auto button in Curves or Levels.
Manual corrections in individual channels
Sometimes different areas of an image require different corrections or adjust-
ments. You can, for example, “paint” corrections into specific areas of a channel 
by using the toning tools in Photoshop’s Toolbox. The image in Figure 6-29 has 
a distinct problem (okay, well, maybe a few problems). In the lower-left corner is 
a light-green blob that needs to be eliminated if there’s any chance of salvaging 
this photo. By using the Burn tool on one channel at a time, you can darken that 
specific area of each channel — each channel according to its needs.
On the left, you can see the distinct light area in the thumbnail of the Red and 
Green channels. On the right, after using the Burn tool, those lighter areas are 
gone in the Green channel, and a similar adjustment to the Red channel elimi-
nates the problem completely.
FIGURE 6-28: 
Make a 
selection and 
change the 
selection’s hue, 
saturation, and 
lightness.

128     PART 2  Easy Enhancements for Digital Images
In addition to the Burn tool, you can use the Dodge, Blur, Sharpen, and Smudge 
tools. You can use the Brush tool and paint with black, white, or gray. You can 
use Levels or Curves on an individual channel or even a selection within one 
or more channels. When fine-tuning (or salvaging) an image, don’t be afraid 
to work in one channel at a time, perfecting that channel’s contribution to the 
overall image.
Take another look at the two Channels panels shown in Figure 6-29. Obviously 
that’s a composite image because there’s only one Channels panel in Photoshop, 
right? On the right, the Green channel is active (you can tell because it’s high-
lighted), and only the Green channel is visible (only it shows the eyeball icon to 
the left). The other channels are invisible, and you see only the grayscale rep-
resentation from the Green channel in the image window. On the left, however, 
only the Red channel is active, but all the channels are visible (indicated by the 
eyeball to the left of each channel). Any change I make to that image in that state 
is applied only to the Red channel. But because all channels are visible, I can see 
the overall impact on my image.
Sometimes you want only one channel visible, such as when you’re trying to 
balance the tonal range throughout the channel, for example. But most of the 
time, you want to see what’s going on in the image as a whole. Click the one 
channel (or Shift+click two channels) in which you need to work. Then click in 
the left column next to the composite channel at the top to make all channels 
visible.
FIGURE 6-29: 
The problem 
is only in one 
area of each 
channel, but 
you can fix it 
manually.

CHAPTER 6  Making Tonality and Color Look Natural     129
The People Factor: Flesh Tone Formulas
One of the toughest and yet most important jobs in Photoshop is making sure that 
skin looks right. People come in a wide variety of colors and shades and tints, and 
all people vary in color in different places on their bodies and at different times of 
the year. (The top and bottom of your forearm are likely different colors, and the 
difference is generally much greater in summer than in winter.) There are even 
some exceptions to those broad generalities. Making skin tones look great is often 
a major, yet often critical, challenge. Many of today’s DSLRs can identify skin in 
an image (particularly faces) and expose the image based on the skin color.
When you have skin in your image, it’s generally part of the focus of the image — 
the person whom you’re photographing. And even when a person isn’t the subject 
of the image, skin attracts attention in the image. The eye naturally goes to people 
in just about any image (perhaps not first, but eventually).
You’ll also find that unnatural variations in skin color are very noticeable. 
­Consider how often you think to yourself that someone looks a little pale, or 
flushed, or sunburned, or tanned, or just plain sick. You’re making that judgment 
call based to a large degree on the appearance of the skin.
Keeping in mind that the numbers shown in Figure 6-30 are general guidelines 
and that real people vary quite a bit, I’ve prepared for you some target values for 
skin tones. Use these formulas loosely when using the techniques in this chapter 
to adjust the color in your images, keeping in mind the individual you photo-
graphed and the lighting at the time.
Note that the numbers are CMYK, even for use with RGB images. Open the Info 
panel menu, choose Panel Options, and set the Second Color Readout to CMYK 
Color. (See Figure 6-31.) Remember, too, that you can use the Color Sampler tool 
to add placeholders in the image, monitoring the changes that you’re making in 
the Info panel. Set the color sampler readings to CMYK in the Info panel itself 
by clicking the eyedropper symbol to the left of the color mode listed for each 
sampler.
FIGURE 6-30: 
These are 
guidelines only, 
not absolute 
values!

130     PART 2  Easy Enhancements for Digital Images
Promise me that you’ll keep in mind that these numbers are for reference only, 
okay? Your individual image determines what the correct adjustment should be. 
You can use these numbers as a starting point, but trust your eyes and evaluate 
your image as you work.

CHAPTER 7  The Adobe Camera Raw Plug-In     131
The Adobe Camera 
Raw Plug-In
W
hen we first started capturing digital photos in a Raw file format, it 
required an investment of tens of thousands of dollars in equipment. 
The wonderful thing about the Raw file format is that you use it to 
record unprocessed image data, which gives you incredible control over the final 
appearance of your image. These days, however, cameras that cost only a few 
hundred dollars can capture images “in the Raw.” Some smartphones can capture 
Raw, too. If you don’t have a Raw-capable camera now, after reading this chapter, 
you might decide that you need to have Raw capability.
In this chapter, I explain how Raw differs from other image file formats and why 
those differences can be important. I show you how to determine whether you 
have what you need to capture in Raw and whether Photoshop’s Adobe Camera 
Raw plug-in is capable of handling your camera’s image files. Most of the rest of 
the chapter looks at the Camera Raw interface and what all those sliders do for 
you and your image.
Understanding the Raw Facts
The Raw file format at its heart is nothing but unprocessed image data. It comes in 
a number of variations — one or several for each camera manufacturer. Each has 
Chapter 7

its own file extension (such as .crw, .cr2, or .nef), and many have their own spe-
cial features that are totally incompatible with each other and even incompatible 
with Raw images from different camera models that use the same file extension. 
And those camera manufacturers love to tinker with their proprietary formats, 
changing them regularly. But each of the formats, at the basic level, is Raw. (Check 
your camera’s User Guide to see whether it’s capable of recording image data in a 
format other than JPEG or TIFF. If so, it’s probably a variation of Raw.)
Thankfully, Adobe updates the Camera Raw plug-in for Photoshop (as shown 
in Figure 7-1) on a regular basis, adding the capability to work with the newest 
cameras shortly after they’re available. (Plug-ins, like Camera Raw and most of 
Photoshop’s filters, extend the program’s capabilities. Updating your plug-ins 
regularly ensures that you have the greatest capabilities.) Be warned, however, 
that purchasing a new camera model the day it comes on the market might mean 
using the camera’s own software for a while until Camera Raw is updated.
In the Camera Raw window in Figure 7-1, notice the thumbnails stacked to the 
left. Select multiple Raw images in the Photoshop File ➪ Open dialog box or in 
Bridge and they all open in Camera Raw together. Click a thumbnail to work on 
that particular image. If you open images that all need a similar correction, adjust 
one and then open the menu to the right of Filmstrip and choose Select All. Open 
the menu again and choose Sync Settings.
FIGURE 7-1: 
The impressive

CHAPTER 7  The Adobe Camera Raw Plug-In     133
Adobe also offers the free DNG Converter software for converting supported Raw 
files to the open source DNG file format. (Open source means that anyone can 
freely use it. The DNG format is also known as “digital negative.”) Although some 
camera manufacturers have adopted the DNG format for their cameras, it’s more 
commonly used “to promote archival confidence, since digital imaging software 
solutions will be able to open raw files more easily in the future” (Adobe). (Of 
course, if sometime in the future Adobe drops Camera Raw support an “archival” 
Raw format, simply use DNG Converter then.)
What’s the big deal about Raw?
Cameras that record images using the Raw format save unprocessed image data. 
When recording as JPEG or TIFF, the camera manipulates the image data, pro-
cessing it in a variety of ways. So what’s the big deal with unprocessed — Raw —  
image data? Assuming that you’re as hungry for food as for knowledge, I’ll use a 
cooking analogy.
Say you purchase frozen lasagna and heat it up in your microwave oven. It probably 
tastes good and fulfills your needs (“Food!”). However, the chef who designed this 
prepared meal and the good folks who churn it out use a specific recipe designed 
to appeal to a large number of people, hopefully offending very few. When you 
reheat your lasagna in the microwave, you have some choices. For example, you 
decide how warm to make it (generally following the package’s reheating instruc-
tions). Perhaps you’ll add some pepper or hot sauce.
What you can’t do with that frozen lasagna is take out some of the salt or fat in 
it from the recipe designed by the chef and prepared by the good folks. You can’t 
substitute olive oil for butter. You can’t cut back on the garlic a bit (just in case your 
date goes well). You’re pretty much restricted by what the original chef and his 
good folks prepared. Sure, you could pour a half-bottle of blue food coloring over 
it, creating a special effect, but you’re not likely to turn that microwavable lasagna 
into a gourmet dinner. So if you’re just hungry and your demands aren’t too severe, 
no problem — shoot JPEG (the digital photo equivalent of a microwave meal).
The gourmet dinner is what Raw is all about! If you consider yourself a gourmet 
chef of the camera, creating art from light, Raw is the format for you. Avoid the 
limitations put on your image editing by preprocessing and dive right in with the 
greatest flexibility. (And you don’t even have to go down to the farmers’ market 
for fresh tomatoes.)
Working in Raw
There’s one critical difference between working with Raw images and working 
with JPEGs or TIFFs: You never actually make changes to the Raw file. Instead, you 

134     PART 2  Easy Enhancements for Digital Images
record your adjustments in the image’s metadata (non-image data recorded with 
the image data) or in a sidecar file (a separate file in which Camera Raw records 
any information that can’t be recorded in the metadata). If you work with the 
DNG format, the metadata is saved inside the DNG file. Because adjustments are 
recorded separately rather than applied to the images, the original image data 
remains unchanged, waiting for you to create again and again, all from the same 
unprocessed, un-degraded image data.
Sidecar files have the same name as the image file, but they use the .xmp file 
extension. Keep each sidecar file in the same folder as the image with which it is 
associated. If you move the image file without taking the sidecar file along for the 
ride, the information stored in the sidecar file won’t be available when you reopen 
the image file, so you’ll need to adjust the image’s appearance all over again.
When capturing in Raw, you can basically ignore all the camera’s settings other 
than aperture, shutter speed, ISO, and (of course) focus. Everything else can be 
adjusted in the Camera Raw plug-in. However, because Raw devotes significantly 
more resources to recording highlights than shadows, it’s not a bad idea to con-
centrate on those highlights when shooting. When the highlights are great to start 
with, you can reallocate some of the image’s tonal range to the deprived shadows, 
thus reducing unwanted digital noise and increasing detail.
Keep in mind that in addition to the Photoshop Camera Raw plug-in, you also 
have available the software that came with your camera. And you might even 
have additional software packages available, such as Adobe Lightroom. And now 
there are Photoshop- and Lightroom-related apps for use on your smartphone 
or tablet. Which package is best? As usual, “best” is a relative term. For example, 
Nikon’s proprietary software does a great job with sharpness when processing 
.nef files, but it lacks some of Camera Raw’s features. If sharpness is your over-
riding requirement, you might prefer the Nikon software. (Remember that your 
Raw file can’t be processed by both the camera’s software and then by Camera 
Raw, but you can process the data with either and then further refine your image 
in Photoshop itself.)
While working in Camera Raw, keep in mind that what happens when you move 
the image from Camera Raw to Photoshop (or save your adjustments and close 
with Camera Raw’s Done button) is governed by Camera Raw’s Workflow Options. 
Discussed later in this chapter, Workflow Options controls the color space, color 
depth, pixel dimensions, and resolution of the image after you’re done in Camera 
Raw. Workflow Options is where you also control whether the formerly Raw file 
opens into Photoshop as an image or a Smart Object and whether a sharpening 
preset is applied.

CHAPTER 7  The Adobe Camera Raw Plug-In     135
Photoshop’s Save As dialog box offers you the option of the Photoshop Raw file 
format. Photoshop Raw is not compatible with the Camera Raw plug-in and does 
not provide you with the benefits of using the Raw format with your digital camera. 
It is, however, necessary for certain high-end graphics and animation programs 
into which someone, somewhere, sometimes places images from Photoshop.
Working in the Camera Raw Plug-In
The cornerstone of Photoshop’s Raw capability is the Camera Raw plug-in. After 
an image is open in Photoshop itself, you manipulate the pixels directly, rather 
than manipulating the metadata. When you work in the Camera Raw plug-in, 
you never change the image itself, only the adjustments recorded in the file’s 
metadata (or in a sidecar file). As shown previously in Figure 7-1, the Camera Raw 
window is filled with tools and sliders. Even though you might not work with all 
the Camera Raw features, here’s the lowdown on the features you find there.
Camera Raw can also be used with any 8- or 16-bit RGB or Grayscale image that’s 
already open in Photoshop, on pixel layers, rasterized type and shape layers, and 
on layer masks. You can access Camera Raw through Photoshop’s Filter menu. 
Keep in mind, however, that the true power of Camera Raw isn’t there when used 
as a filter — the image data has already been processed and Camera Raw as a filter 
is simply another adjustment tool. Understand that the Camera Raw filter doesn’t 
suddenly “un-process” your image data and make it a Raw file, it simply lets 
you use Camera Raw’s adjustments as you would with, for example, a sharpen-
ing or noise reduction filter, or a Curves adjustment. Also keep in mind that you 
can select one or more layers and convert them to a Smart Object (Layer ➪ Smart 
Objects ➪ Convert to Smart Object) and use Camera Raw as a Smart Filter, which 
enables you to return to the filter and changes settings later.
Tools and preview options
Across the top of the Camera Raw window are thirteen tools and three buttons (as 
shown in Figure 7-2) for manipulating your image and the workspace. Starting 
from the left, the tools are Zoom, Hand, White Balance, Color Sampler, Targeted 
Adjustment, Crop, Straighten, the new Transform tool, Spot Removal, Red Eye 
Removal, Adjustment Brush, Graduated Filter, and the Radial Filter. To the right 
of the tools are buttons to open Camera Raw’s Preferences as well as two rotation 
buttons.

136     PART 2  Easy Enhancements for Digital Images
Before and After
As you can see to the lower-right of the image preview in Figure 7-1, there are 
four buttons. The first button allows you to see the before and “after” (actually 
“current”) version of the image. (The views is always labeled Before and After 
in all views using this button.) When you click the button (keyboard shortcut Q), 
the original image is shown next to the current adjustment. Click a second time 
and you get before and after without the dividing line. Click a third time and you 
get before and after views stacked rather than side by side. Another click removes 
the dividing line. Another click removes the Before image. With Before and After 
showing, the second button (shortcut P) swaps the before and after adjustments. 
The third button (shortcut Option/Alt+P) copies the current settings to the Before 
image, enabling you to save where you are in your work and then continue mak-
ing changes that you may or may not want to keep. The fourth button (shortcut 
⌘  +Option+P/Ctrl+Alt+P) toggles between the current settings and the default set-
tings for the panel in which you’re working. Note that if you have multiple images 
open in the Filmstrip column, you can add the Shift key to the first three but-
tons’ shortcuts to apply Before and After to all selected images. Of course, if you 
haven’t yet made adjustments to those other selected images, you won’t see any 
difference.
Regardless of which tool is selected, positioning the cursor over the Before image 
automatically activates the Zoom tool. You can, of course, drag in the image to 
reposition it when zoomed in. The Zoom tool enables you to zoom in and you can 
“scrubby” zoom by holding down the mouse button (or trackpad) and dragging 
the tool in the window. With the Zoom tool, you can hold down ⌘  /Ctrl and drag a 
rectangle to zoom in to a specific area.
Trash
When multiple images are open in Camera Raw, you also have the Trash icon 
available to the right of the rotation buttons. With one or more image thumbnails 
selected, click the Trash button to mark the files for deletion. When you click the 
Done or Open Images button, marked images are sent to your computer’s Trash 
or Recycle Bin. Mark images for deletion only when you’re sure you have no use 
for them.
FIGURE 7-2: 
Camera Raw 
offers 13 tools 
for perfecting 
your images 
and up to nine 
color samplers.

CHAPTER 7  The Adobe Camera Raw Plug-In     137
Zoom, Hand, and White Balance
These three tools function as you would expect — they zoom in and out and repo-
sition a zoomed-in image in the window, and you can click with the White Balance 
tool on something in the image that should be gray (not something that is already 
gray, but that should be gray) to automatically adjust the Temperature and Tint 
sliders. It’s a one-click way to neutralize any color cast and correct the color bal-
ance. If you get an unexpected result, click elsewhere. And, of course, afterward 
you can still tweak the Temperature and Tint sliders as desired.
Color Sampler
When you add color samplers (a maximum of nine) to the image preview area 
(click with the Color Sampler tool), their values are displayed below the tools, as 
you see in Figure 7-2. When you haven’t added color samplers, that area is col-
lapsed, leaving more room for the preview area. Color samplers in Camera Raw 
function the same as they do in Photoshop (see Chapter 6). Color samplers are vis-
ible as numbered targets in the preview area, strategically located in critical areas 
of the photo. You can use the Color Sampler tool to drag existing color samplers 
to new locations or delete them by Option/Alt+clicking on the sampler. Clicking 
the Clear Samplers button deletes all existing color samplers. Remember, too, that 
the position of the cursor can function as an additional color sampler — the RGB 
values are shown below the histogram.
Targeted Adjustment
Designed for on-image adjustments, you click the Targeted Adjustment tool 
(shown in Figure 7-3), hold down the mouse button, select the type of adjustment 
you want to make, and then click directly in the image preview. Drag up or down 
and left or right to adjust the image’s appearance. Whether you elect Parametric 
Curve, Hue, Saturation, Luminance, or Grayscale Mix, the appropriate pane opens 
to the right so that you can monitor (and fine-tune) the adjustment. If you select 
Parametric Curve and click in a light area in the image, the Highlights or Lights 
sliders are adjusted; if you click in a dark area, Shadows or Darks are adjusted. 
With the other four options for the Targeted Adjustment tool, you’re adjusting 
a specific range of color — based on the color on which you click — as you drag.
Crop and Straighten
Click and hold the Crop tool icon to select an aspect ratio (relationship between 
width and height), as shown in Figure 7-4. Drag the Crop tool to create a bound-
ing box, which will automatically adjust to Landscape or Portrait orientation as 
you drag. You can then adjust the size of the bounding box by dragging its anchor 
points. You can also rotate an image while cropping: Position the tool just outside 
the bounding box and drag to rotate.

138     PART 2  Easy Enhancements for Digital Images
If you drag the Straighten tool (found to the right of 
the Crop tool) along a line in the image that should 
be horizontal or vertical — perhaps the intersec-
tion of two walls or the horizon — a crop bound-
ing box is created with that alignment. Using the 
Crop tool’s Custom option enables you to specify 
the resulting image’s dimensions in aspect ratio, 
pixels, inches, or centimeters. Keep in mind that 
the Straighten tool uses the aspect ratio currently 
selected for the Crop tool, so pick the aspect ratio 
before dragging the Straighten tool.
When you have the Crop tool’s bounding box just 
right and you’ve finished adjusting the image’s 
appearance, click the Open or Done button. Should 
you change your mind about cropping even after 
leaving Camera Raw, re-open the image into 
­Camera Raw, click the Crop tool, hold down the 
mouse button to show the menu, and select Clear 
Crop. Or you can eliminate the bounding box (when 
the Crop tool is active) by pressing Delete (Mac) or 
Backspace (Windows).

Transform
The new Transform tool, which is used to correct perspective, has several options: 
Auto, Level Correction Only, Level and Vertical Perspective Correction, Full Cor-
rection, and Guided (drag two or more lines in the image to define what should 
be vertical and horizontal). You also have seven sliders to correct everything from 
Vertical and Horizontal to Offset X and Offset Y. An optional grid can be overlaid 
and you can adjust the size of the grid with a slider. Best of all, however, is when 
you click a button and see the message “No Upright correction found.” Congrats! 
You took a good photo!
Spot Removal
The Spot Removal tool gives you the ability to make minor corrections right in the 
Camera Raw dialog box. As shown in Figure 7-5, it offers capabilities similar to the 
Healing Brush and the Clone Stamp, including an Opacity slider. It can be used to 
either heal or clone. However, the Spot Removal tool’s behavior is quite different. 
To use the Spot Removal tool, follow these steps:
1.	 Set the size of the brush and click the area that you want to heal or  
clone over.
2.	 Drag to expand the tool’s diameter.
You can also set the diameter using the Size slider to the right.
3.	 Position the source (green) and destination (red) circles.
When you release the mouse button after setting the tool’s diameter, a pair of 
circles appears. Click within the green circle and drag it over the element from 
which you want to clone or heal. You can also drag the red circle to fine-tune 
the location of the destination. You can click the edge of either circle and drag 
to resize them both (or use the Size slider).
FIGURE 7-5: 
Camera Raw’s 
Spot Removal 
tool offers 
both healing 
and cloning 
modes.

140     PART 2  Easy Enhancements for Digital Images
4.	 Repeat, accept, or clear.
Clicking outside the circles accepts the change and starts the next healing/
cloning process. Changing tools and continuing with your adjustments accepts 
the changes. Clicking the Clear All button (just above Camera Raw’s Done 
button) deletes the changes you made with the Spot Removal tool.
Pressing the forward slash key jumps the source circle to someplace that the tool 
thinks might be a good place from which to heal or clone. Press it repeatedly and 
you’ll see that the “auto patch” is more like “random patch.” It’s your image; you 
should decide the source location according to your artistic vision.
The Visualize Spots option at the bottom shows you a black and white version of 
the image, the better to see problem areas.
Red Eye Reduction
To use the Red Eye Reduction tool, 
drag a rectangle around the entire 
eye, 
including 
some 
surrounding 
skin. (See Figure  7-6.) It automati-
cally tries to hunt down and elimi-
nate any suspicious red eye in the 
rectangle. You might need to adjust 
the Pupil Size and Darken sliders (in 
the area to the right, under the His-
togram) to fine-tune the adjustment, 
but you can also simply click and drag 
the edges of the box created by the Red Eye Removal tool.
Adjustment Brush
To make localized adjustments in specific areas of your image, select the Adjust-
ment Brush (shown in Figure  7-7), drag the sliders, and paint in the image. 
You can paint a number of different adjustments (use the New button) or paint 
the same adjustment in different areas (use the Add button). And remember 
that these adjustments are only recorded in the metadata, and therefore can be 
changed any time down the road. It’s not quite the same as duplicating layers and 
using layer masks in Photoshop, but it’s still a great non-destructive way to paint 
adjustments!
Graduated Filter
The Graduated Filter tool enables you to set the adjustment in the area to the 
right, and then drag the tool in the image window. The adjustment is applied 
FIGURE 7-6: 
Minimize the haunted red eye effect right in 
Camera Raw.

CHAPTER 7  The Adobe Camera Raw Plug-In     141
at full strength in the area before 
your first click, and is gradually faded 
through the area where you dragged 
(see Figure  7-8). You can add more 
than one graduated adjustment if nec-
essary. Note that in the menu shown 
to the right in Figure  7-8, Graduated 
Filter also has sliders for Temperature, 
Tint, Exposure, and Contrast above the 
Highlights slider.
New is the Brush option, which enables 
you to paint (and erase) adjustments in 
the image. In addition, near the bot-
tom of the Graduated Filter and Radial 
Filter options, is the new Range Mask 
feature. You can set it to concentrate 
the adjustment(s) based on luminance 
or color, and use sliders to control the 
effect. Consider, for example, adjust-
ing the saturation of the sky behind a 
tree. Drag the Gradient Filter tool and 
you make changes to the sky and those 
parts of the tree within the adjustment. 
Range Mask can be used either to set 
Color or Luminance to darken the tree 
limbs to mask them out of the adjustment.
The Radial Filter works in much the same way as the Graduated Filter. However, 
as you can probably guess by its name, it uses circular or oval areas of adjustment 
rather than linear adjustments. Like the Graduated Filter, the Radial Filter enables 
you to add more than one area of adjustment. The Radial Filter also now has the 
Brush and Range Mask options, and the same sliders as the Graduated Filter, as 
well as a Feather slider that enables you to soften the edges of the adjustment.
Camera Raw Preferences
To the right of the tools are Camera Raw’s buttons to quickly open Camera Raw’s 
Preferences (the same as using the keyboard shortcut ⌘  +K/Ctrl+K) and to rotate 
the image in 90 degree increments in either direction.
FIGURE 7-7: 
Paint to make adjustments to exposure, 
brightness, contrast, and more.

142     PART 2  Easy Enhancements for Digital Images
Here are some options in the Preferences that you might want to consider:
»
» Save settings in sidecar files. This is already the default, and it’s a good  
one. When Camera Raw can’t record data directly to the image file’s existing 
metadata, you can either save everything in one central location — which 
means you lose everything if that database is damaged or lost — or each 
image you adjust can have its own .xmp file to hold your adjustments. Keep in 
mind that the DNG file format holds metadata within the DNG file itself.
»
» Make defaults specific to camera serial number. If you shoot with more 
than one camera, you can use separate defaults for each of them. You can 
also make defaults that change based on the ISO setting with which each 
image was captured. Camera Raw tracks which camera is which by the serial 
number embedded in the image’s metadata.
»
» Update DNG previews. If you work with Adobe’s DNG Converter and make 
DNG copies of your images, doesn’t it make sense that you’d want the latest 
adjustments reflected in the file’s preview? (The JPEG preview is used by your 
computer’s operating system and other programs that can’t read DNG files.) 
And those previews might as well be full size, eh?
FIGURE 7-8: 
Like using a 
graduated 
filter when 
shooting, but 
with more 
control!

CHAPTER 7  The Adobe Camera Raw Plug-In     143
You’ll also find options in Camera Raw’s Preferences for opening JPEG and TIFF 
files into Camera Raw. Keep in mind that after you open an image in either format 
using Camera Raw, you’ll have to go through Camera Raw every time you open 
that image (unless, of course, you disable all support for JPEG and TIFF files in 
Camera Raw’s Preferences). If you ever decide you don’t want to open a particular 
image through Camera Raw again, use Photoshop’s Save As command to create 
a new copy of the picture. Or simply use Photoshop’s Filter ➪ Camera Raw from 
within Photoshop for such images.
The histogram
Because of the unprocessed nature of Raw images, the histogram you see in the 
upper-right corner of the Camera Raw window (refer to Figures 7-1 and 7-3) is 
generally far more important than the Histogram panel in Photoshop itself. By 
keeping an eye on the histogram while you adjust sliders, you can ensure that 
you’re not blowing out the highlights (when the very right end of the histogram 
starts crawling up the edge) or clogging the shadows (the left edge gets too tall). 
The RGB values that you see just below the histogram represent the values of 
the pixel directly under the cursor when the cursor is in the preview area of the 
­window. To toggle a preview of any “clipping” in your image, click the triangles in 
the upper left (shadows) and upper right (highlights) of the histogram. Any place 
where the shadows are being forced to pure black, losing detail that you could 
retain, you see a bright blue overlay. Use the Shadows and Blacks sliders to cor-
rect the problem. Anywhere that the highlights are being blown out to pure white, 
again losing valuable detail, click the triangle to the right and you see a bright red 
overlay. Use the Highlights and Whites sliders to bring the problem under control. 
(Using the individual sliders is discussed later in the chapter.) You can hide these 
clipping warnings by again clicking the triangles. The triangles change color to 
tell you what’s wrong or which colors are causing the problem. You might want 
to hide the overlays when creating special effects. (I readily admit that I often 
intentionally clog shadows and blow out highlights to produce special effects and 
to focus attention on the subject of my photos.)
The preview area
As shown previously in Figure 7-1, the bulk of the Camera Raw window is filled 
with the image preview, giving you the best possible view of your work. Remem-
ber that you can drag a corner or edge of the Camera Raw window to resize it. The 
preview area benefits/suffers from the changes that you make as you enlarge/
shrink the window. To the lower left are a pop-up menu with preset zoom fac-
tors, and a pair of buttons to zoom in or out. (Don’t forget about the Zoom tool!) 
Camera Raw’s maximum zoom percentage is 1600%.

144     PART 2  Easy Enhancements for Digital Images
Workflow Options and presets
Just below the preview area in Camera Raw is a line of information including the 
file’s color space, color depth, dimensions, file size, and resolution. Click that line 
to open the Workflow Options dialog box.
Workflow Options enables you to change any of the specifications you saw in the 
line you clicked, add a sharpening preset, and the option to open images from 
Camera Raw into Photoshop as Smart Objects by default.
»
» Space: Camera Raw offers the four major color spaces — Adobe RGB, 
ColorMatch RGB, ProPhoto RGB, and sRGB — as well as other profiles 
available in Photoshop. Color spaces (read about them in Chapter 6) 
­determine which colors are available in an image.
Using the ProPhoto RGB color space gives you the widest gamut (the largest 
number of possible colors), which minimizes the chance of colors getting 
squished into each other as you work with your image. If your image has 
extreme colors, use ProPhoto and 16-bit color in Camera Raw, and then, if 
your printer can’t handle ProPhoto as a color space, choose Edit ➪ Assign 
Profile to change to your required profile (Adobe RGB for inkjet printers or 
sRGB for images being sent to a photo lab). Select Relative Colorimetric as the 
rending intent.
»
» Depth: Because a greater color depth means more possible variations in 
color, generally you want to select 16-bit color and either keep the image in 
that color depth or switch to 8-bit color later in Photoshop by choosing 
Image ➪ Mode ➪ 8-Bits/Channel. Use 8-bit color for any image that must be 
saved in JPEG format (including web images), or when the file size overwhelms 
your printer. You might also opt for 8-bit color if storage space is limited. 
(Chapter 6 includes a detailed explanation of color depth.) When working with 
a 16-bit image and in the Save As dialog box you select JPEG, Photoshop will 
automatically convert the image to 8-bit color when you click Save. However, 
you won’t see an estimate of the saved file’s size. If that’s important, convert to 
8-bit color before opening Save As.
»
» Image Sizing: Select Resize to Fit and you can specify the resulting image size 
in a number of ways: Width & Height, Dimensions, Long Side, Short Side, 
megapixels, and Percentage.
»
» Resolution: Resolution is simply an instruction to a printing device about what 
size to make each pixel. It can be assigned in Camera Raw or later in 
Photoshop’s Image Size dialog box (with Resample deselected). Generally 
speaking, 300 ppi (now, finally, the default) is a more appropriate resolution 
for images that will be printed.

CHAPTER 7  The Adobe Camera Raw Plug-In     145
»
» Sharpen For: The Sharpen For menu provides you with presets designed for 
specific purposes, including on-screen presentation, inkjet prints on glossy 
paper, and prints on matte paper. Each category includes Low, Standard, and 
High options. This sharpening is in addition to the sharpening you add on 
Camera Raw’s Detail tab. (Generally I leave this set to None and sharpen each 
image according to the image’s content in Photoshop.)
»
» Open in Photoshop as Smart Objects: This option enables you to automati-
cally open your Raw image into Photoshop as a Smart Object. Smart Objects, 
which are discussed in Chapter 10, can be scaled and transformed multiple 
times with minimal degradation of the image quality. And, as explained in 
Chapter 15, you can apply Smart Filters — filters that can be re-opened and 
changed — to Smart Objects.
On the subject of workflow, let me also suggest two ways that you can save loads 
of time when working with Camera Raw: Create your own defaults and use saved 
settings. If you use the same settings almost all the time, or at least start with 
those settings, click the button to the right of Preset at the top and select Custom. 
You can set up a number of different presets for various purposes.
Here’s my recommendation:
1.	 Open one of your typical images.
Open an image that’s well exposed and typical for what and how you shoot. 
Don’t open some wild image that’s three-quarters wrecked and in need of 
emergency surgery.
2.	 Adjust the image to make it look perfect.
The various adjustments are discussed in the following sections. Make all the 
necessary adjustments, including noise reduction and camera calibration if 
required.
3.	 Save as your new defaults.
Open the Presets menu and select Custom to create a new set of default 
settings.
Now when you open one of your images into Camera Raw, you’ll already have 
a good correction established and you’ll need to tweak the settings only a bit to 
adjust for the peculiarities and vagaries of that particular shot.
Remember, too, that you can save settings for each individual shoot by using Pre-
set’s Custom option. Say, for example, that you shot on-location under difficult 
lighting circumstances. Rather than adjusting each image, adjust one, save the 
settings, and load (or apply) those settings for each additional image from that 
shoot that needs to be processed.

146     PART 2  Easy Enhancements for Digital Images
The Basic panel
When it comes to actually adjusting your 
images in Camera Raw, the meat-and- 
potatoes portion is the Basic panel. Click 
the leftmost of the eight adjustment 
tabs directly below the histogram area to 
open the Basic panel, which is shown in 
Figure 7-9.
Here are some general guidelines for 
working in the Basic panel (but remem-
ber that each image has its own particular 
requirements):
»
» First adjust the white point. Generally, 
you adjust the white point (the 
Temperature and the Tint sliders) by 
clicking with the White Balance tool in 
some area that should be neutral and 
close to white. If the image doesn’t look 
right, click elsewhere or manually adjust 
the Temperature and Tint sliders.
»
» Adjust the exposure. Drag the Exposure 
slider right or left to spread the histo-
gram across most of the space available. 
(Remember, these are general guidelines 
for typical images, not “rules.”)
»
» Fine-tune the shadows and highlights. Use the Highlights and Shadows 
sliders to adjust the relationship between the brightest pixels and the 
midtones and between the darkest pixels and the midtones. You can fine-
tune the highlights a bit more with the Whites slider and touch up the 
shadows with the Blacks slider.
»
» Fine-tune the contrast. Drag the Contrast slider to the right to increase 
contrast or to the left to flatten out the image’s contrast.
»
» Make the image “pop” with the Clarity slider. Drag the Clarity slider to the 
right to increase the contrast among neighboring areas of color. Somewhat 
akin to sharpening, this slider can do a great job of adding life to most images.
»
» Tweak the colors. Using the Vibrance slider in conjunction with the 
Saturation slider, adjust the appearance of the color in your image. 
Remember that the Saturation adjustment is applied to all colors in the image, 
while Vibrance works primarily with the near-neutral colors.
FIGURE 7-9: 
The Basic panel is where you do the bulk 
of your image correction.

CHAPTER 7  The Adobe Camera Raw Plug-In     147
Double-click any slider control to reset that slider to its default value. This works 
not only for sliders in the Basic panel, but also for sliders anywhere in Camera Raw.
As you work, the best adjustments are those that make the image look great to you 
and meet your creative goals. The order of adjustments and the histogram sugges-
tions here are not appropriate for all images. Let your artistic sense be your guide.
The Tone Curve panel
The second tab in Camera Raw, just to the right of the Basic tab, presents you with 
a pair of ways to adjust the histogram using curves. (See Figure 7-10.) In the Tone 
Curve panel, you have two tabs: Parametric and Point. The first thing to know 
about the Tone Curve adjustments is that they are in addition to changes you make 
VIBRANCE AND SATURATION
Both the Vibrance and the Saturation sliders in Camera Raw adjust the intensity of 
colors in your image. So what’s the difference? The Saturation slider changes all color 
in the image, whereas the Vibrance slider works its magic primarily on those pixels that 
are least saturated. To see how this works, open an image in Camera Raw and adjust 
the sliders to make the image look great. Drag the Saturation slider all the way to the 
left. Grayscale, right? Move the Saturation slider all the way to the right. Oversaturated, 
right? Drag the Vibrance slider slowly to the right while keeping an eye on areas of 
the image that are close-to-but-not-quite gray. Watch how they increase in saturation, 
­gradually going from near gray to almost colorful. Now here’s the coolest trick of all: With 
Saturation still at +100, drag the Vibrance slider all the way to the left, to –100. Starting 
with an appropriate image, this can be a very interesting effect.

148     PART 2  Easy Enhancements for Digital Images
on the Basic tab. All changes are cumulative — dragging sliders in the Parametric 
panel, for example, won’t change the sliders on the Basic tab.
In the Parametric panel, you adjust four sliders to control various parts of the 
tonal range. The three sliders immediately below the curve itself govern the pivot 
points around which the sliders bend the curve. The two outer sliders govern what 
part of the tonal range is affected by the Shadows and Highlights sliders, and the 
middle slider controls the relationship between the Darks and Lights sliders.
The Point panel of the Tone Curve tab is quite similar to the Curves adjustment in 
Photoshop: Click the curve to add an anchor point; drag up and down to adjust that 
part of the tonal range. You can add up to 14 separate points to the curve. Click an 
anchor point to make it active (it appears as a solid point rather than hollow), and you 
can use the Input and Output fields to adjust the point numerically, or use the arrow 
keys to change the point’s location. You can also choose a preset from the Curve 
menu as a starting point and, if desired, adjust each of the RGB channels individually.
So, you might ask yourself, “Should I use the Basic tab, the Tone Curve tab, or 
both?” And the answer is, “Yes, you should use the Basic tab, or the Tone Curve 
tab, or both.” You might find that you’re more comfortable using one curve or 
the other rather than the Blacks, Brightness, and Contrast sliders on the Basic 
tab. Or you might find that for one particular image, you want to make large 
adjustments with one set of sliders and fine-tune with the other.
FIGURE 7-10:

changes to 
tonality on  
the Tone 
Curve tab.

CHAPTER 7  The Adobe Camera Raw Plug-In     149
The Detail panel
Nine sliders on the Detail tab (as shown in 
Figure 7-11) control sharpness and noise in 
your image. I suggest that as soon as you 
click the Detail tab, you zoom in to 200% 
or even 400% on an area of shadow in your 
image and drag the sliders all the way to the 
left, setting them to 0 (zero). Rather than 
working from the top down, as you do in 
most Camera Raw panels, I generally sug-
gest reducing noise before sharpening. Drag 
the Color Noise Reduction slider slowly to 
the right until all red/green/blue specks 
in the shadows disappear. Next, drag the 
Luminance slider to the right until the bright 
specks in your shadows are reduced but not 
so far to the right that detail in your image 
is damaged. Use the Luminance Detail, 
Luminance Contrast, and Color Detail slid-
ers in conjunction with the Luminance and 
Color sliders to minimize the loss of detail. 
Note the new Color Smoothness slider that 
keeps the color and color detail adjustments 
from becoming too sharp (or sharper).
Sharpening in Camera Raw has developed so much that it’s actually perhaps bet-
ter than sharpening in Photoshop. Rather than a single slider, you now have four 
sliders with which to perfect your images:
»
» Amount: The Amount slider is the basic how-much-sharpening-am-I-adding 
slider. You might consider “sharpening” to be creating bright and dark “halos” 
along edges in the image. Amount refers to the brightness/darkness of those 
halos. The slider ranges from zero to 150.
»
» Radius: The Radius slider controls the width of the “halos” along the edges. 
Higher is wider, up to a maximum of 3 pixels.
»
» Detail: Use the Detail slider to control how large an edge has to be to get 
included in the sharpening process. Leave it at zero and only major edges in 
the image are sharpened. Drag the slider all the way to the right, to 100, and 
everything in the image gets sharpened, every pore, each grain of sand — 
even the remains of any digital noise you want to hide.
»
» Masking: The Masking slider, used in conjunction with the Detail slider, can help 
protect the smallest detail in the image from becoming over-sharpened and 
garish. The farther to the right you drag the slider, the more tiny detail is excluded.
FIGURE 7-11: 
Reducing noise and smoothing luminance 
can greatly improve shadow areas.

150     PART 2  Easy Enhancements for Digital Images
Here’s the coolest part: Zoom in to at least 100% and hold down the Option/Alt key 
while dragging any of the Sharpening sliders — you’ll see a grayscale preview of 
what you’re actually doing to your image!
Figure 7-12 shows three views of the same image: The unsharpened original (top), 
the Sharpening sliders set to Amount–85, Radius–1.0, Detail–55, and Masking–5 
(middle), and the preview of the Detail adjustment (bottom).
HSL, grayscale, and split toning
Working with options on three tabs, Camera Raw’s HSL/Grayscale feature gives 
you incredible control over hue, saturation, and luminance (HSL) of specific color 
ranges in your image. Need to perk up the reds in your image? Not a problem — 
just boost the Reds slider in Saturation and Luminance! Yellows a bit too garish? 
Tone ’em down with the Yellows slider. Maybe the green grass looks a bit yellow. 
Drag the Greens slider halfway to the right on the Hue tab. You can control each of 
the eight major color ranges independently (as shown in Figure 7-13).

A fourth tab, Grayscale Mix, appears only when the Convert to Grayscale check 
box is selected. With the Convert to Grayscale option selected, you control the 
contribution of each range of color to the final grayscale image. Use the Basic tab’s 
Exposure, Blacks, Brightness, and Contrast sliders to control the overall appear-
ance of the image.
The Saturation tab also enables you to create partial grayscale images quite easily. 
Drag some sliders to the left to make those areas of color grayscale; drag others to 
the right to enhance the remaining colors. Figure 7-13 shows an excellent candi-
date for this partial-grayscale technique.
The Split Toning tab is generally used in conjunction with the Convert to Grayscale 
option HSL/Grayscale tab. (Although you can use it to make adjustments to high-
lights or shadows, you would generally remove or introduce a color cast on the  
Basic tab with the Temperature and Tint sliders.) Think of split toning as creating 
a sepia or Duotone version of an image. As you can see in Figure 7-14, you have 
separate controls for adjusting the highlights and shadows. Select a different hue 
for each and adjust the saturation independently. The Balance slider allows you to 
control what part of the tonal range is considered a highlight or shadow.

152     PART 2  Easy Enhancements for Digital Images
To create a sepia effect, start with a value of 40 in both of the Highlights fields 
and perhaps +30 for Balance. Use a Shadow saturation value of 0 (and because 
saturation is set to 0, it doesn’t matter what value you select for the Hue slider). 
Remember, too, that you can select the same hue for both Highlights and Shadows 
to create a monochrome effect.
Compensating with Lens Corrections
Use the Lens Corrections tab’s controls to compensate for certain undesirable 
characteristics of your lens. (See Figure 7-15.) Click the Profile tab within Lens 
Corrections, select the Enable Profile Corrections check box and let Camera Raw 
fine-tune your image based on a database of lenses. You can further adjust for pin 
cushioning (the center of the image looks too far away) and barrel distortion (the 
center seems to be bulging) with the Distortion slider. The Vignetting slider is 
used for excessive shadowing or brightening in the corners of the image. (Use this 
slider only to correct for unwanted vignetting. If you want to add a vignette, use 
the Post Crop Vignetting section of the Effects pane, discussed in the next section.)
The Manual tab in the Lens Corrections panel can be used when there’s no pro-
file available. It can also supplement auto corrections made on the Profile tab. It 
offers sliders for adjusting distortion, fringing, and vignetting. Both the Profile 
and Manual tabs have the option of showing a grid over the image as you make 
your adjustments.

CHAPTER 7  The Adobe Camera Raw Plug-In     153
Adding special effects
The Effects pane of Camera Raw, shown in 
Figure 7-16, is used to dehaze (remove any 
fog-like softening of the image), add simu-
lated film grain and vignette effects. Instead 
of using Photoshop’s Artistic ➪ Film Grain 
or Texture ➪ Grain filters, you may choose 
to simulate grain in Camera Raw. (Or per-
haps you won’t add any film grain. Ever. 
Especially after you worked so hard to 
minimize noise in your images. Your digi-
tal images.) The Post Crop Vignetting slid-
ers are used to add a dark or light vignette 
effect (unlike the Vignette slider discussed 
in the preceding section, which is used to 
remove a vignette.) You can add a vignette 
before or after working with the Straighten 
and Crop tools. For both Grain and Post Crop 
Vignetting, adjust the Amount slider first to 
activate the other sliders. Experiment with 
the three options in the Style menu to see 
which type of vignette best suits your artis-
tic vision.

Camera profiles, ­presets, and snapshots
Generally you’ll skip the Camera Calibration 
tab completely, with one exception: Make 
sure that the Process menu is set to the lat-
est version, “Version 4 (Current)” (or later 
when an update is available), to take advan-
tage of the improvements in this version of 
Camera Raw. You might, however, want to 
use the Camera Calibration tab to compen-
sate for what you perceive to be regular and 
consistent deviation in your particular cam-
era’s behavior. You might, under some cir-
cumstances, want to use the sliders on the 
Camera Calibration tab (see Figure  7-17) to 
reduce a color cast, an unwanted color tint in 
the image. Use very small adjustments!
If your particular camera model has had mul-
tiple profiles created, you’ll see them listed 
in the Name menu. These camera profiles 
correlate to the in-camera settings you may 
have selected when capturing the image. (The 
content of the menu varies from one camera 
model to the next.)
Camera Raw’s Presets tab simply stores a 
convenient list of your saved presets. Any 
time you use the Save Settings command from the menu to the right of the tabbed 
area or click the New Preset button in the lower-right of the Presets panel, your 
preset is added to the list for convenient one-click application. To use Saved Set-
tings, open an image in Camera Raw, open the Presets panel, click the preset and 
click Open Image/Open Object or Done. Click the Trash button in the lower right 
to delete any no-longer-needed preset.
You may find the Snapshots panel to be very useful, especially when you’re work-
ing on perfecting a particularly difficult image. While you’re working on an image, 
if you think you’ve reached a good spot but want to continue playing around with 
the image, open the Snapshots panel and click the New Snapshot button to the 
lower right. Name the snapshot (using a name that will actually mean something 
to you later) and then continue adjusting the image. If later you decide to return 
to the snapshot, simply select it in the panel. The snapshots are saved in the file’s 
metadata, so you can always open the image into Camera Raw and select them 
FIGURE 7-17: 
The Camera Calibration sliders might 
be useful for correcting a color cast.

sometime down the road. Snapshots are also a great way to save variations of an 
image for different purposes! (Remember to hold down the Option/Alt key and 
click Open Copy if you’ve monkeyed around with a great-looking image and don’t 
want to override the saved settings.)
The Camera Raw buttons
In the lower-left and lower-right corners of Camera Raw are four buttons, three 
of which have hidden features that you access by pressing the Option/Alt key:
»
» Save Image . . ./Save Image: After making your adjustments, click the Save 
Image . . . button to save a copy of the image as a DNG, JPEG, TIFF, or PSD file. 
Option/Alt+click to bypass the Save Options dialog box and simply save the 
image using the most recently selected options. If more than one image is 
open, the buttons are Save Images . . . /Save Images.
»
» Open Image/Open Copy (or Open Object/Open Copy): After making your 
adjustments, click Open to update the file’s metadata and open the image in 
Photoshop itself. Holding down Option/Alt changes the button to Open Copy, 
which opens the image without updating the metadata. You might use Open 
Copy when creating a second version of the image while preserving your 
exactingly precise original adjustments. (Remember that a simple change in 
the Workflow Options — which you open by clicking the blue information line 
under the preview — enables you to automatically open an image from 
Camera Raw into Photoshop as a Smart Object.) If more than one image is 
open, the buttons show the plurals, Images, Objects, and Copies.
»
» Cancel/Reset: Clicking Cancel closes the Camera Raw window without making 
any changes to the image’s metadata. Holding down the Option/Alt key 
changes the button to Reset, which restores the settings seen when you first 
opened the image in Camera Raw.
»
» Done: The Done button, with or without the Option/Alt key, simply updates 
the image’s metadata with the adjustments you’ve made and closes Camera 
Raw without opening the image.

Fine-Tuning Your Fixes
T
here you are, repainting the bedroom  — all by yourself, saving money, 
being productive — and it’s time to do the windows. Now, you probably 
don’t want to paint over the glass, right? Just the frame, the sash, the sill, 
those little whatch-ya-call-its between the panes, right? (Okay, technically the 
dividers between the panes are called muntins.) There are several ways you can 
avoid painting the glass. You can use a little brush and paint very carefully. You 
can use a larger brush, paint faster, and scrape the excess from the glass after-
ward. You can grab the masking tape, protect the glass, and paint as sloppily as 
you like — when the tape comes off, the glass is paint-free.
Those are unbelievably similar to the choices that you have in Photoshop when 
you need to work on only a part of your image. You can zoom in and use tools, 
dragging the cursor over only those pixels that you want to change (just like using 
a tiny paintbrush). You can use the History Brush feature (which I introduce in 
Chapter 1) to restore parts of the image to the original state (like scraping the 
glass). You can isolate the area of the image you want to change with a selection 
(much like protecting the rest of the image with masking tape).
In this chapter, you read about getting ready to make changes to your image 
rather than actually making those changes. You can isolate groups of pixels in 
your image in a variety of ways. For example, you can select pixels that are in the 
same part of the image (regardless of color), or you can select pixels that are the 
same color (regardless of location in the image). This is power: the ability to tell 
Photoshop exactly which pixels you want to alter. After you make that selection, 
you can manipulate the pixels in a variety of ways — everything from making

color and tonal adjustments to working with Photoshop’s creative filters to simply 
copying them so you can paste them into another image.
I discuss “taping the glass” first by making selections and then by using masks —  
channels that actually store selection information. After that, I tell you about work-
ing with adjustment layers, which are special layers that help you apply certain color 
and tonal adjustments without actually changing any pixels in the image. An adjust-
ment layer even lets you restrict the change to one or several layers in the image.
What Is a Selection?
When you make a selection in your image, you’re simply isolating some of the 
pixels, picking them (selecting them) so that you can do something to those pixels 
without doing it to all the pixels in your image. Photoshop shows you what part 
of the image is within the selection with a flashing dashed line. (Now that you’re 
part of the Photoshop Inner Circle, you call that selection boundary the marching 
ants.) Say, for example, that part of your image looks great, but part of the image 
looks, well, just plain wrong. Figure 8-1 is an excellent example.
By making a selection and applying an adjustment, I can make this image look 
much, much better. Of course, you might choose to make a different selection and 
FIGURE 8-1: 
Sometimes 
only part of the 
image needs 
changes.

CHAPTER 8  Fine-Tuning Your Fixes     159
apply a different adjustment, but you can see what I chose to do in Figure 8-2. 
By selecting the rails (in this case, with the Polygonal Lasso tool, which I explain 
later in this chapter), I isolate those areas from the rest of the image, enabling me 
to change the color of those pixels without changing anything else. (Rather than 
selecting and darkening the rails to make them appear to be in front of a glow, I 
could have selected the lighter area and created a uniform sky color. But this is 
visually more interesting.)
The tonal and color adjustments that I discuss in Chapter 6 are often applied to 
an image as a whole. You can, however, apply them to specific areas of an image. 
Much of the rest of the work that you do in Photoshop is not global in nature, but 
rather is done to only restricted areas of your image. You use selections to do that 
restricting.
You can also use selections for a variety of other jobs in Photoshop. One of the 
most common is copying from one image and pasting into another. You can see 
one example in Figure 8-3. The subject of one image (upper left) is selected. You 
can see a close-up of the selection to the right. Choosing Edit ➪ Copy copies the 
selected pixels to the Clipboard. You can then switch to another image and choose 
Edit ➪ Paste to drop those pixels into a second image (lower left). You can adjust 
the size by choosing Edit ➪ Transform ➪ Scale, adjust the position by dragging 
with the Move tool, and perhaps add some shadows by using the Brush tool or 
a Drop Shadow layer style (discussed in Chapter 12). The composited picture is 
ready for whatever nefarious purpose you might have in mind!
Any pixel in your image can be selected, deselected, or partially selected. For 
example, if you have a selection and fill it with red, the selected pixels turn red, 
the deselected pixels don’t change, and the partially selected pixels get a red tint. 
How much tint depends on the level of selection. (Photoshop generally uses 8-bit 
grayscale for selections, so there are 256 different levels of “selected.”)

(visible to the

160     PART 2  Easy Enhancements for Digital Images
Feathering and Anti-aliasing
You need to keep in mind a couple of very important terms as you read about the 
various tools and commands with which you make selections. Both feathering and 
anti-aliasing make the edges of your selections softer by using partially transpar-
ent or differently colored pixels. That, in turn, helps blend whatever you’re doing 
to that selection into the rest of the image.
Don’t forget that all pixels in your image are square, aligned in neat, orderly rows 
and columns. (That’s the raster in raster artwork.) When you create a curve or 
diagonal in your artwork, the corners of the pixels stick out. Feathering and anti-
aliasing disguise that ragged edge. You can also use feathering to create larger, 
softer selections with a faded edge. Generally speaking, use anti-aliasing to keep 
edges looking neat and use feathering to create a soft, faded selection.
Nothing illustrates the power of feathering quite like a simple black-on-white 
demonstration, as you see in Figure 8-4. In the upper-left, I made an unfeathered 
selection and filled it with black. To the upper-right, the filled selection is exactly 
the same size but has a 2-pixel feather. Below, I used a 15-pixel feather when 
making the selection.
FIGURE 8-3: 
Make a 
selection, 
copy, switch to 
another image, 
and paste.

CHAPTER 8  Fine-Tuning Your Fixes     161
Note that there’s feathering on both sides of the selection border. And don’t be 
fooled by the amount that you enter in the Feather field on the Options bar — 
that’s a general guideline, not a precise value. A 15-pixel feather for the Elliptical 
Marquee tool might give you 50 or 60 partially transparent pixels, half on either 
side of the selection border. Even a 1-pixel feather gives you a selection with sev-
eral “soft” pixels on either side.
Anti-aliasing is similar to feathering 
in that it softens edges: It’s designed 
to hide the corners of pixels along 
curves and in diagonal lines. You use 
anti-aliasing with type (as I explain 
in Chapter 13). You’ll often find that 
anti-aliasing is all you need to keep 
the edges of your selections pretty; 
feathering 
isn’t 
required. 
Anti-
aliasing is a yes/no option, with 
no numeric field to worry about. 
Figure 8-5 compares a diagonal with 
no anti-aliasing, with anti-aliasing, 
and with a 1-pixel feather.
FIGURE 8-4:

feathering,

Anti-aliasing helps smooth the appearance of

162     PART 2  Easy Enhancements for Digital Images
At 100% zoom (to the upper left), the first line looks bumpy along the edges (it 
has a case of the jaggies, you would complain to a friend or co-worker). The lower 
line looks soft and mushy, out of focus. And the middle line? To quote Goldilocks, 
“It’s just right!” When zoomed to 600%, you can really see those jaggies and 
that softening. And in the middle, you see that the anti-aliasing uses light gray 
and mid-gray pixels interspersed along the edge among the black pixels. At 100% 
zoom (upper left), your eye is fooled into seeing a straight black edge.
Generally speaking, use anti-aliasing with just about every selection (other than 
rectangular or square), and use feathering when you want to really soften the 
edges to create a special effect.
Making Your Selections with Tools
Photoshop offers you nine tools whose whole purpose in life is to help you make 
selections. You also use those tools to alter your selections by adding to, subtract-
ing from, and intersecting with an existing selection. The nine selection tools are 
divided into three groups:
»
» Four marquee tools
»
» Three lasso tools
»
» The Quick Selection tool and the Magic Wand
Marquee selection tools
You have four marquee selection tools, although you’ll generally use only two 
of them. Figure 8-6 shows the marquee selection tools, along with each tool’s 
Options bar configuration. (Note that the Select and Mask button is available even 
when you do not have an active selection in your image.)
You drag the very useful Rectangular Marquee and Elliptical Marquee tools to 
make selections. Click and drag in any direction to make your selection. After you 
start dragging, hold down the Shift key (while still dragging) to constrain propor-
tions. When you constrain the proportions of a selection, you create a square or 
circle rather than a rectangle or an ellipse. If you start dragging a selection and 
press the Option (Mac)/Alt (Windows) key, the selection centers itself on the point 
where you click. The Shift and Option/Alt keys can be used together. Holding down 
the Shift key before you click and drag adds the selection to any existing selection. 
Holding down the Option/Alt key before dragging subtracts the new selection from 
any existing selection.

CHAPTER 8  Fine-Tuning Your Fixes     163
The Single Row Marquee and Single Column Marquee tools are simply clicked 
at the point where you want a 1-pixel selection, running from side to side or 
from top to bottom. These tools create selections that extend the full width or full 
height of your image. You might use these tools to create a gridlike selection that 
you can fill with color. Or you might never use them at all.
Take another glance at the Options bars in Figure 8-6. The four buttons to the left 
on the Options bar, which you can use with any of the tools, determine how the 
tool interacts with an existing selection.
»
» New Selection: When you select the first button, any selection that you make 
replaces an active selection (deselecting any previous selection). If, with a 
selection tool, you click inside an active selection when the first option is 
active, you can drag that selection in your image without moving any pixels. 
When you haven’t already made a selection, these tools always make a new 
selection, regardless of which button is active.
»
» Add To: When you have an active selection and need to add to that selection, 
use the second button or simply press and hold down the Shift key before 
dragging.
»
» Subtract From: When you have a selection and need to deselect part of it, 
use the third button. Say, for example, that you make a round selection and 
want to chop out the middle to make a donut shape. Click the third button 
FIGURE 8-6:

four flavors,

164     PART 2  Easy Enhancements for Digital Images
and then drag within the original selection to deselect the donut hole. This 
is comparable to holding down the Option/Alt key before dragging the 
selection tool.
»
» Intersect With: You have a selection, but you want to keep only part of the 
selection. You could set your selection tool to subtract from the existing 
selection, or you could intersect with that original selection and deselect a 
number of areas at once.
Figure 8-7 presents a visual explanation of how all four buttons work. On the left, 
you see the selected option for the active marquee selection tool. Next is an origi-
nal selection. In the third column, you see another selection being made (with the 
selection tool dragged from the lower right to the upper left). Finally, on the right, 
you see the result of combining the two selections.
In the bottommost example, you could do a whole series of subtractions from the 
existing selection to chop off the “points,” but using the intersect option takes 
care of the job with a single drag.
While you’re dragging a selection with the Rectangular Marquee or the Elliptical 
Marquee tool, you can hold down the mouse button and press and hold the space-
bar to reposition the marquee. When you have it where you want it, release the 
spacebar and continue to drag.

CHAPTER 8  Fine-Tuning Your Fixes     165
Take another look at the four views of the Options bar shown earlier in Figure 8-6. 
Take note of these variations among them:
»
» Anti-aliasing isn’t available for the Rectangular Marquee tool. That’s because 
all four edges of the selection will align perfectly with the edges of the 
pixels — no need to disguise corners of pixels. (You can, of course, soften the 
selection with feathering.)
»
» Both the Rectangular Marquee and the Elliptical Marquee tools offer the 
options of Normal (unconstrained, just drag as necessary), Fixed Aspect Ratio 
(the relationship between width and height you specify on the Options bar is 
maintained as you drag), and Fixed Size (just click in the upper-left corner of 
your intended selection).
»
» The Single Row Marquee and Single Column Marquee tools offer the four 
buttons to determine how the tool will interact with an existing selection and 
the Feather field. Although feathering a 1-pixel-wide or -tall selection seems a 
little strange. . ..
CONTROLLED SELECTIONS
Lurking within the Options bar Style drop-down menu are two options worth noting: 
Fixed Aspect Ratio and Fixed Size. Using the Fixed Aspect Ratio option with the 
Rectangular Marquee or the Elliptical Marquee tool forces the selection to the height 
and width relationship that you specify on the Options bar. This is great for compos-
ing an image that you need at a specific size, say to fit in a standard 5 x 7-inch picture 
frame. The selection tool won’t resize the image for you, but you can make the selec-
tion and choose Image ➪ Crop and then choose Image ➪ Image Size to resize to your 
required dimensions and resolution. (Read about resizing and cropping your images in 
Chapter 2.)
The Fixed Size option changes the behavior of the tools. After you enter an exact width 
and height on the Options bar, position the cursor in the upper-left corner of the area 
that you want to select and click once — the selection is created to the lower right of that 
point. Don’t worry about being exact because you can drag the selection marquee into 
position afterward. (You’ll want to have the leftmost of the four buttons on the Options 
bar selected to reposition your selection.) When you’re using the Fixed Aspect Ratio or 
Fixed Size styles options there is a button between the Width and Height fields on the 
Options bar that swaps the values in the two fields.

166     PART 2  Easy Enhancements for Digital Images
Lasso selection tools
Three lasso selection tools are available in Photoshop. On the Options bar, all three 
of the lasso selection tools offer the same basic features that you find in the mar-
quee selection tools, as you can see in Figure 8-8. You can add to, subtract from, 
or intersect with an existing selection. You also have the feathering and anti-
aliasing options available. The Magnetic Lasso tool offers three additional settings 
that help determine how it identifies edges as you drag.
So what makes lasso tools different from a marquee tool? Read on to find out:
»
» Lasso tool: The Lasso tool is a true freeform tool; that is, you click and drag it 
wherever you want the selection to go. You can drag around and return to the 
starting point, or you can release the mouse button anywhere, and your 
selection is finished along a straight line from that point to the spot where you 
start your selection. If you press and hold the Option/Alt key while dragging, 
you’ll temporarily switch to the Polygonal Lasso tool.
»
» Polygonal Lasso tool: Rather than dragging, you click-click-click to make 
straight selection segments, at any angle, for any distance. When you position 
the cursor directly over your starting point, a little circle appears to the lower 
right of the cursor to indicate that you’re back to the start. Or simply double-
click to finish the selection. If you press and hold the Option/Alt key while 
dragging, you’ll temporarily switch to the regular Lasso tool, which lets you 
drag your selection any way you want. Using the Option/Alt key lets you switch 
back and forth between the freeform drag of the Lasso tool and the perfectly 
straight selection borders of the Polygonal Lasso tool.
»
» Magnetic Lasso tool: When you need to select around a subject that has good 
contrast with its background, the Magnetic Lasso tool can do a great job. The 
perfect candidate for this tool is a simple object on a very plain background. 
You can, however, use it with just about any image where the edges of the area 
you want to select differ substantially from the rest of the image. Click and drag 
FIGURE 8-8: 
The basic 
options for the 
lasso selection 
tools match 
those for the 
marquee 
selection tools.

CHAPTER 8  Fine-Tuning Your Fixes     167
the tool along the edge of your subject. If the tool misses the edge, back up 
and drag along the edge again. If the edge makes a sudden change in direction, 
click to add an anchor point. If the tool places an anchor point in the wrong 
spot, back up and then press Delete/Backspace to remove the point. (By the 
way, if you have a Wacom pressure-sensitive tablet hooked up, you can set the 
Magnetic Lasso tool to vary its width according to pen pressure. Use the button 
just to the right of the Frequency field on the Options bar.)
The Magnetic Lasso tool works by identifying the difference in color along 
the edges, using all available color channels. From the Options bar, use the 
Width field to tell the tool how wide of an area it can look in to find an edge. 
The Edge Contrast field tells the tool how much the edge must differ while 
searching. Use the Frequency field to choose the number of anchor points the 
tool sets while outlining the selection.
You can open the Channels panel and click each of the channels individually to 
see if there’s greater contrast between what you want to select and the surround-
ing pixels in one of the channels. With just that channel active, use the Magnetic 
Lasso to make the selection, then click the composite channel (RGB or CMYK, 
located at the top of the Channels panel) to make all of the channels active again.
The Quick Selection tool
Consider the Quick Selection tool to be sort of a color-based-selection-in-a- 
brush. You drag the tool through an area of color and based on the color variations 
under the brush and the brush size, the tool automatically selects similar colors in 
the surrounding area. Keep in mind that you can adjust the brush size as you work 
by using the square bracket keys. (When working with a Wacom tablet, this tool 
works great with brush size set to pen pressure.) The Auto-Enhance option on the 
Options bar may slow down the performance of the Quick Selection tool a bit, but 
the great job it does analyzing edges usually produces a better selection. With just 
a little practice, you’ll likely find the Quick Selection tool to be quite simple to use, 
even for rather complex selections (see Figure 8-9).
The Magic Wand tool
The Magic Wand tool selects pixels similar in color to the pixel on which you click 
with the tool. Like the other selection commands, you can add to, subtract from, 
or intersect with an existing selection, and you can select anti-aliasing. Tolerance 
determines how closely pixels must match your target color to be included in the 
selection. When you select the Contiguous check box and then click a spot, only 
pixels connected to the spot by pixels of the same color are selected. The Sample 
All Layers option lets you make a selection of similarly colored pixels on every 
visible layer in your image, not just the currently active layer.

168     PART 2  Easy Enhancements for Digital Images
When you use a low Tolerance setting, you select only those pixels in the image 
that are very similar to the pixel on which you click. A high Tolerance setting gives 
you a much wider range of color, which might or might not be appropriate for the 
selection you’re making.
Select and Mask
You may have noticed the Select and Mask button in Figures 8-6, 8-8, and 8-9. It 
sits quietly to the right of the other options on the Options bar, waiting for you to 
click. This button replaces the Refine Edge option in earlier versions of Photoshop. 
(The Refine Edge brush is still available in the left column of Select and Mask.) 
Select and Mask’s Properties panel is shown in Figure 8-10.
Here’s what you need to know about each of the options in Select and Mask:
»
» View: Click the downward-pointing triangle to select from among several 
different ways to view the selection you’re refining. Using a black or white or 
red mask is great for many images, but the On Layers option shows you the 
content of the selection as if it was floating on a separate layer. Show Radius 
and Show Original are great for a quick preview of what you’re doing, but 
you’ll generally take a look and then disable those options. The keyboard 
shortcuts for the various views are also handy, especially X to disable all views 
and show the original and F to cycle through the view modes to see which is 
most appropriate for the current task.

»
» Edge Detection: The Radius slider determines how much of an area sur-
rounding the initial selection will be refined. The Smart Radius option enables 
Select and Mask to differentiate between hard edges and soft edges — think 
in terms of the edge between the subject’s shirt and the background (usually a 
well-defined “hard” edge) versus the subject’s hair and the background 
(usually a fuzzy “soft” edge).
»
» Global Refinements: Smoothing the selection edge minimizes any jagged 
areas. Feathering (as described earlier in this chapter) softens the edge. 
Contrast makes the selection edge more distinct. (You rarely use Feather and 
Contrast together.) Shift Edge expands or contracts the selection edge.
»
» Output Settings: Here’s where Select and Mask really rocks! You can click OK 
and see a newly refined selection marching around some pixels in your image, 
but you also have the options of clicking OK and producing a layer mask 
(background layers are automatically converted), a new layer with only the 
content of the refined selection, a new layer using a layer mask to reveal the 
content of the selection, a new document with only the content of the 
selection, or a new document consisting of a layer using a layer mask to reveal 
the content of the selection! Decontaminate Colors can do a great job of 
eliminating that fringe of background color that sometimes appears when 
you’re making complex selections. (With this option selected, you output to a 
new layer or document, with or without a layer mask.)

»
» Tools: To the upper left, the Tools panel in Select and Mask are the usual 
Zoom and Hand tools for inspecting your work up close. Above them are the 
Quick Selection tool, the Refine Edge Brush, the Brush tool, and the Lasso tool 
for adjusting the original selection.
»
» Remember Settings: If you hit upon a sweet set of refinement settings that 
look like they are a sure-fire answer to most of your selection challenges, by 
all means make sure to select the Remember Settings box before you click 
OK. Select and Mask then starts with those preferred settings each time you 
open the dialog box.
Select and Mask can also be used to tweak an existing layer mask. In the Layers 
panel, click the layer mask thumbnail to make it active. In the Select menu or 
the Options bar, choose Select and Mask. Use the options discussed in the previ-
ous list, elect to output to a layer mask, and click OK. The selected layer mask is 
updated to reflect the changes you specified.
Your Selection Commands
You have 19 menu commands at your 
service when selecting pixels and layers 
in your artwork. Some, like those near 
the top of the Select menu, are rather 
simple and aptly named. See Figure 8-11 
for a list of the Select commands. The All 
Layers, Deselect Layers, Find Layers, and 
Isolate Layers commands are not used 
to select pixels, but rather to change the 
activation of layers in the Layers panel.
The primary selection 
commands
The commands near the top of the Select 
menu are features that you’re likely 
to use regularly. (Okay, maybe not the 
Reselect command.) Memorizing their 
keyboard shortcuts and using them reg-
ularly is a timesaver:
FIGURE 8-11: 
The Deselect or Reselect command — or 
both — are always grayed out, depending 
on whether there is (or was) an active selec-
tion in your image.

CHAPTER 8  Fine-Tuning Your Fixes     171
»
» Select All (⌘  +A/Ctrl+A): Select All does exactly what the name implies — it 
makes a selection of all the pixels in your image on the active layer (or in an 
active layer mask).
»
» Deselect (⌘  +D/Ctrl+D): Use the Deselect command to make sure that no 
pixels are selected. This is a handy command when it seems that a tool, or a 
filter or adjustment command isn’t working. There could be an unnoticed 
selection in the image, preventing the command from appearing how — or 
where — you expect.
»
» Reselect (⌘  +Shift+D/Ctrl+Shift+D): This is a great little command for those 
times when you’re making a complex selection, and a little slip accidentally 
deselects. Just use Reselect to restore the most recent selection. Or use the 
Undo command.
»
» Inverse (⌘  +Shift+I/Ctrl+Shift+I): The Inverse command reverses the 
selection. What was selected is deselected, and what wasn’t selected becomes 
selected. (You must include the Shift key — without it, you invert the colors in 
your image rather than inverting your selection!)
The Color Range command
In its own little group with the Focus Area command, right in the middle of the 
Select menu, is the incredibly powerful Color Range command. Rather than drag-
ging the Quick Selection tool or Shift+clicking with the Magic Wand, you can select 
by color quickly and easily with the Color Range command. The pop-up menu at 
the top of the Color Range dialog box lets you pick among the RGB (red/green/
blue) and CMY (cyan/magenta/yellow) colors, as well as the image’s highlights, 
midtones, or shadows, and even any out-of-gamut colors in the image (colors that 
can’t be reproduced within the selected color space). When you choose one of the 
presets from the top menu (other than Skin Tones), the Fuzziness slider isn’t 
available, limiting that feature’s value.
In Figure 8-12, I clicked and dragged through some orange areas in the image 
with the middle Eyedropper tool. You can also click once with the left eyedropper 
and use the other eyedroppers to add and subtract colors from the selection. The 
Fuzziness slider near the top of the dialog box determines how close a color must 
be to those through which you dragged to be included in the selection.

172     PART 2  Easy Enhancements for Digital Images
Here are a couple of ways that you can get a better look at your selection as you 
create it. In Figure 8-13, you see the options available from the Selection Preview 
menu. The Grayscale (upper left) and Black Matte (upper right) do a good job of 
showing that the background will be partially selected if you click OK. You can 
lower the Fuzziness or use the eyedropper on the right to click in those areas of the 
fence behind the blooms that shouldn’t be selected. The White Matte (lower left) 
does an excellent job of showing that the tips of some leaves below the blooms will 
also be selected. (Ignore that and Option+drag/Alt+drag with the Lasso tool later 
to deselect that area.) Because of the color of this image’s subject, the red Quick 
Mask preview (lower right) is almost worthless for this image, although it is often 
good with other images that don’t have red and orange.

offers four

None.

CHAPTER 8  Fine-Tuning Your Fixes     173
The Localized Color Clusters option looks for distinct areas of the selected color 
and tightens up edges along those “clusters” of color. When your target color 
appears distinctly in different areas of the image, this option is a plus. When 
selecting a range of color with subtle transitions, deselect this option. (Think 
“leopard’s spots” compared to “blue sky.”)
When the Localized Color Clusters option is active, Color Range also offers Detect 
Faces. If you have people in the image that you want to select, Detect Faces does 
a rather good job of identifying them. You’ll still need to Shift+drag through the 
rest of the person to make the selection, but faces are a good starting point. And 
don’t overlook the Skin Tones option in the Select menu — it’s a great way to start 
selecting flesh tones in an image.
Also available only when the Localized Color Clusters option is active, the Range 
slider determines how far from the point where you clicked in the image Color 
Range should look for similar colors. When set to 100%, Color Range looks at the 
entire image for similar colors. If you want to restrict the area in which you want 
to create a selection, you can reduce that value.
The Focus Area command
The Focus Area command is useful primarily when the subject of the shot is 
in focus and the background of the image is out focus. It offers the same View 
options as Color Range, as well as the Hand and Zoom tools and a pair of brush-
using tools to add to or subtract from the initial selection. The In-Focus Range 
slider enables you to define what is “in focus.” (Don’t overlook the Auto box.) The 
Advanced section includes only an Image Noise Level slider. (Why this isn’t with 
In-Focus Range instead of being hidden in a separate section? I don’t know.) You 
also have the various Output To options found in Color Range. The Soften Edge 
option slightly feathers the selection, but you have no control over it. If you want 
a feathered edge, click OK and use the Feather command.
With practice, Focus Area can become a useful tool. And by “practice” I mean 
finding out what sort of images it works with best. I can certainly recommend this 
command if you shot a subject in front of an overcast sky — the sky is effectively 
selected as “out of focus."
Selection modification commands
The next group of commands in the Select menu actually holds five separate Mod-
ify commands (shown in Figure 8-11), each of which has a single numeric field.

174     PART 2  Easy Enhancements for Digital Images
The Border option creates a selection of your specified width, centered on the 
original marching ants visible in the image window. It’s great for creating borders 
or vignettes and can also be used to delete pixels along a selection edge to neaten 
it up. The other four commands are poor cousins to the control you have in the 
Select and Mask dialog box — none of them offers a slider or a preview. However, 
if you know exactly how many pixels you need to smooth or expand or contract or 
feather, these commands are quick and simple.
As you make your way down the Select menu, you come across the Grow and Simi-
lar commands, which are somewhat like the Magic Wand with Contiguous (Grow) 
and without Contiguous (Similar) selected on the Options bar. (In fact, they use 
the Magic Wand’s Tolerance setting.) Grow adds to your selection any adjacent 
pixels of the appropriate color, and Similar looks throughout the entire image for 
similarly colored pixels. Use Grow and Similar when your initial selection consists 
primarily of a single color. Using these commands with a selection that contains 
lots of different colors generally results in most of your image being selected.
Transforming the shape of selections
As you work with selections, you might find times when the selection features 
don’t match your need. For example, the Elliptical Marquee tool can certainly 
make oval selections, but those ovals are either vertical or horizontal. What if you 
need an oval selection at an angle? That’s where the Select ➪ Transform Selec-
tion command comes into play. Make your initial selection, choose the Transform 
Selection command, and then manipulate the selection to fit your needs, as shown 
in Figure 8-14.
Here’s what you see in Figure 8-14:
»
» Top left: This is the original selection.
»
» Top center: Click an anchor point on any side of the bounding box and drag 
to change the height or width of the selection.
»
» Top right: Position the cursor outside the bounding box and drag to rotate. 
The selection is rotated around the crosshair, located by default in the middle 
of the selection. Before rotating, you can drag that crosshair anywhere, even 
outside the selection’s bounding box.
»
» Middle left: Drag any corner anchor point to manipulate the selection’s width 
and height at the same time.
»
» Middle center: Hold down the Shift key while dragging a corner anchor point 
to avoid distorting the selection while changing size.

CHAPTER 8  Fine-Tuning Your Fixes     175
»
» Middle right: Hold down the Option/Alt key while dragging a corner anchor 
point, and you end up scaling the image based on that crosshair in the center 
of the bounding box. (You can drag that crosshair anywhere, even outside the 
bounding box, to change the point of transformation.) You can use the Shift 
key with Option/Alt, too.
»
» Bottom left: Hold down the ⌘  /Ctrl key and drag any side anchor point to 
skew.
»
» Bottom center: Hold down the ⌘  /Ctrl key and drag a corner anchor point to 
distort.
»
» Bottom right: If you ⌘  /Ctrl+drag two or four corner anchor points, you can 
add perspective to the selection. I might, for example, fill this transformed 
selection with color, move the selection, scale it down a bit, fill again, and 
repeat a number of times to create a series of paw prints marching into the 
distance.

Edit in Quick Mask mode
With Photoshop’s Quick Mask mode, you make a basic selection, enter Quick Mask 
mode (by choosing Select ➪ Edit in Quick Mask Mode, clicking the button second 
from the bottom of the Toolbox, or by pressing Q on the keyboard), edit the selec-
tion as if it were a mask, and then exit Quick Mask mode (by deselecting this 
command in the Select menu, by clicking again on the button in the Toolbox, 
or by pressing Q again). Heck, you don’t even have to start with a selection! In 
Quick Mask mode, your mask appears on-screen as a red overlay, just like the red 
overlay for Refine Edge or Color Range (as you can see in Figure 8-13 in the lower-
right corner). Paint, apply filters or adjustments, or make selections — anything 
you can do to a grayscale image, you can do in Quick Mask mode. (The following 
sections go into further details on working in masks.)
If you’re more comfortable with the Brush tool than the Lasso tool, you might want 
to use Quick Mask mode to make all your selections. You might find it faster and 
easier to “paint” a selection in Quick Mask mode rather than to drag a selection 
with a lasso tool or use the selection commands. Enter Quick Mask mode, paint 
the mask, exit Quick Mask mode, and you have your selection. You can also enter 
and exit Quick Mask mode by clicking 
the button near the bottom of the 
Toolbox. Double-clicking the button 
opens the Quick Mask Options dialog 
box (as shown in Figure 8-15). You can 
reverse the behavior of the overlay, 
making it show selected areas instead 
of the deselected areas, and you can 
change the color and opacity of the 
overlay. (Hop back to Figure  8-13 to 
see how hard it is to see the edges 
of the orange blooms with the red 
overlay. Changing the overlay to, say, 
blue would solve that problem.)
By default, you paint with black in Quick Mask mode over areas that you don’t 
want selected, paint with white over areas that you do want selected, and paint 
with shades of gray over areas that you want partially selected.
The mask-related selection commands
At the bottom of the Select menu, you see a pair of commands that you use to 
store your selections for future use and to actually reuse them. When you save 
a selection, you create an alpha channel in the image. The alpha channel, like a 
color channel, is a grayscale representation of the image. White areas in the alpha 
FIGURE 8-15: 
You can change the opacity and color of the 
Quick Mask overlay.

CHAPTER 8  Fine-Tuning Your Fixes     177
channel represent areas that are selected when the channel is loaded as a selec-
tion. Black areas in the channel show you deselected areas. Gray represents feath-
ering and other partially selected pixels.
I discuss channels in greater depth in the next section of this chapter. While you’re 
exploring selection commands, the key points to remember are that you can use 
the Save Selection command to save any selection as an alpha channel, and then 
later you can use the Load Selection command to reactivate the selection without 
having to re-create it from scratch.
Masks: Not Just for Halloween Anymore
In Photoshop, a mask is a channel (in the Channels panel) that stores information 
about a selection or about layer visibility (or that can be used with certain filters as 
a bump map, a grayscale representation of 3D in the image). When you talk about 
selections saved as masks, you can refer to them as alpha channels. Any time you 
make a complex selection, consider saving it as an alpha channel, just in case. 
So what exactly counts as complex? That depends on how much time you have on 
your hands. If it takes me more than a minute or two to do anything in Photoshop, 
I want to save it. And what counts as just in case? You might need to return to the 
image at some later date to make changes, you might need to shut down for the 
day, or maybe you’ll even (fingers crossed against!) have a crash. Save your selec-
tions, just in case . . .
Saving and loading selections
Creating an alpha channel from a selection is as simple as choosing Select ➪ Save 
Selection and selecting a name for the new channel. If you have more than one 
document of exactly the same pixel dimensions open in Photoshop, you can select any 
of the available documents for the new channel. If you already saved a selection 
as an alpha channel, you can elect to have the two selections interact in a single 
channel.
When you need to work with a saved selection, choose Select ➪ Load Selection or 
simply ⌘  +click/Ctrl+click the alpha channel’s thumbnail in the Channels panel — 
both will activate the selection. As you see in Figure 8-16, when loading a selec-
tion, you can add to, subtract from, or intersect with an active selection. You 
can also invert a selection when loading by selecting the Invert check box. Using 
that check box produces the same result as loading the selection and choosing 
Select ➪ Inverse, but it’s faster and easier.

178     PART 2  Easy Enhancements for Digital Images
Editing an alpha channel
Alpha channels, like color channels, are grayscale representations. As such, you 
can edit them like you would any grayscale image. Click the channel in the Chan-
nels panel to make it active and visible. You see it in the image window as a gray-
scale (or black and white) representation of the saved selection. If you want to 
see the image while you work on the channel, click in the left column (the eyeball 
column) to the left of the RGB (or CMYK) channel. The alpha channel then appears 
as a red overlay on top of the image, just like working in Quick Mask mode or 
using the red overlay in Refine Edge or Color Range. Figure 8-17 shows you what 
the screen looks like with just the alpha channel visible (left) and how it appears 
when the alpha channel is active and the RGB channel is also visible. Also take a 
look at the difference in the Channels panel. See the eyeball column on the left?
FIGURE 8-16: 
When you 
already have 
an active selec-
tion, an alpha 
channel can 
replace, add to, 
subtract from, 
or interact 
with it.
FIGURE 8-17: 
You can see 
just the alpha 
channel itself 
(left) or as a 
red overlay 
(right).

CHAPTER 8  Fine-Tuning Your Fixes     179
Here are some of the things that you might want to do to an active alpha channel:
»
» Blur the alpha channel. Blurring an alpha channel (Filter ➪ Blur commands) 
is much like feathering a selection — it softens the edges. One of the big 
differences is that you can see a preview of the blur, which is much better 
than guessing how much feathering you need while dragging a selection tool.
»
» Sharpen the alpha channel. Sharpening a saved selection (Filter ➪ Sharpen 
command) makes the edges cleaner and more precise.
»
» Paint in the alpha channel. Painting with the Brush tool using black, white, 
and gray in the channel changes the selection. Paint with white to add areas 
to the saved selection; paint with black to remove areas from the selection; 
paint with shades of gray to partially select areas of the image. You can edit an 
alpha channel with the Brush tool very precisely, adding and eliminating stray 
pixels, as well as creating precise edges.
»
» Use Levels or Curves on the alpha channel. If the saved selection has 
feathering or other areas of partial selection (grays in the alpha channel), you 
can manipulate them with a Levels or Curves adjustment (from the Image ➪  
Adjustments menu). The Levels adjustment is particularly appropriate for 
controlling the feathering along an edge.
»
» Apply one or more filters to an alpha channel. Use artistic filters on a saved 
selection to create special effects, such as borders and frames. Chapter 15 
covers filters.
Adding masks to layers and Smart Objects
When your image has multiple layers (as I discuss in Chapter 10), including Smart 
Objects, you can partially hide the content of the layer or Smart Object with layer 
masks. Layer masks and alpha channels have much in common: Layer masks are 
selections saved as channels; you can paint in the layer mask, you can apply filters 
and adjustments to the layer mask, and so on. Just keep in mind that a layer mask 
appears in the Channels panel only when you select its layer in the Layers panel. 
(In the Layers panel, you’ll see the layer mask thumbnail to the left of the layer’s 
name.) If you want to edit a layer mask, click its thumbnail in the Layers panel (or 
the channel name in the Channels panel) and then edit it as you would an alpha 
channel or choose Select ➪ Select and Mask to edit the mask as you would edit a 
selection with Select and Mask. Remember to click the layer thumbnail afterward 
to reactivate the layer itself.
The easiest way to add a layer mask is to make a selection of the pixels that you 
want visible on that layer and then click the Add Layer Mask button at the bottom 
of the Layers panel (third button from the left). You can also make a selection and 

180     PART 2  Easy Enhancements for Digital Images
choose Layer ➪ Layer Mask ➪ Reveal Selection or Layer ➪ Add Layer Mask ➪ Hide 
Selection. That menu also offers Reveal All and Hide All as well as commands to 
disable (hide) or delete the layer mask. You can also apply the layer mask, which 
deletes any hidden pixels on that layer.
By default, the layer mask is linked to the layer or Smart Object. If you drag the 
layer in the Layers panel, the mask comes right along, staying in alignment. If 
you like, you can unlink the mask from the layer content by clicking the Link icon 
between the two thumbnails in the Layers panel. Re-link the mask to the layer 
content by clicking in the empty space between the thumbnails.
If the image’s Background layer is active in the layers panel and you want to add 
a layer mask, simply make the selection and click the Add Layer Mask button. The 
Background layer is automatically converted to a regular layer. (Yet another one 
of those “Why did we have to wait so long?” features.)
Masking with vector paths
A layer or Smart Object can also be masked with a vector path. (Paths are explained 
in Chapter 11.) Vector masks can have very precise edges, and you can edit them as 
a path with the Direct Selection tool. A layer can have both a regular pixel-based 
layer mask and a vector mask. To show up in your artwork, pixels on that layer 
must be within both the layer mask and the vector mask. When a layer has both a 
layer mask and a vector mask, the vector mask thumbnail appears to the right in 
the Layers panel.
Adjustment Layers: Controlling Changes
Photoshop gives you the capability of making tonal and color adjustments that 
you can later refine, change, or delete. Most of the adjustment commands (dis-
cussed in Chapter 6) are available as adjustment layers. An adjustment layer applies 
the selected change to color or tonality just as the comparable command would, 
but using an adjustment layer offers a few major advantages:
»
» Adjustable adjustments: You can reopen an adjustment layer’s dialog box at 
any time to change the settings.
»
» Reversible adjustments: You can delete an adjustment layer, removing the 
change from your image.
»
» Hidden adjustments: Click the eyeball column to the left of the adjustment 
layer in the Layers panel to temporarily hide that change.

CHAPTER 8  Fine-Tuning Your Fixes     181
»
» Tweakable adjustments: You can change the opacity and blending mode of 
adjustment layers to fine-tune the effect.
»
» Limitable adjustments: You can add layer masks and vector masks to your 
adjustment layers to restrict their effect to only some of the pixels below. And 
you can later edit the masks as necessary.
Because of the added flexibility, you’ll generally want to use adjustment lay-
ers rather than adjustment commands in your images. Of course, you still need 
the Image ➪ Adjustments menu for those several commands that can’t be added 
through an adjustment layer.
Adding an adjustment layer
Photoshop uses the Adjustments and Properties panels (shown in Figure 8-18) as 
a quick and easy way to add adjustment layers to your images. Open the panel, 
select a preset or, for a custom adjustment, click the button for the type of adjust-
ment layer you want to add. The Properties panel changes to a small version of 
that particular adjustment’s dialog box, presenting you with the same options you 
have when using the Image ➪ Adjustments menu.
When an adjustment layer is selected in the Layers panel, several buttons appear 
at the bottom of the Properties panel (to the right in Figure 8-18):
»
» Clip the adjustment layer to the layer immediately below: Click the button 
to toggle between the adjustment layer being applied to only the one layer 
FIGURE 8-18:

panel; to the 
right, a Curves 
adjustment 
layer being 
added to the 
image using 
the Properties 
panel.

182     PART 2  Easy Enhancements for Digital Images
immediately below in the Layers panel and it being applied to all layers below. 
(Clipping adjustment layers is explained more completely in the next section.)
»
» Review previous adjustment: Click and hold down the mouse button to see 
the image as adjusted prior to returning to the adjustment layer. Say, for 
example, that you have added a Curves adjustment layer and later return 
to the Adjustments panel to tweak the curve a bit. To see the difference 
between the current appearance of the image and the appearance of the 
image with the original Curves adjustment, use this button. If you prefer the 
untweaked version, use the Undo command.
»
» Reset adjustment: Click the curled arrow button toward the right to reset the 
current adjustment to the adjustment’s default settings.
»
» Toggle adjustment layer visibility: Click the eyeball button to hide the 
current adjustment layer; click again to show it. Use this button to preview the 
adjustment as you work.
»
» Delete adjustment layer: Click the Trash icon to the far right at the bottom 
of the Adjustment panel to delete the current adjustment layer.
You can also add an adjustment layer through the menu at the bottom of the Lay-
ers panel (click the fourth button from the left) and then move the cursor to the 
type of adjustment layer that you want to add, and also through the Layer ➪ New 
Adjustment Layer submenu. The choices are the same. When you select the par-
ticular adjustment that you want to add from the bottom of the Layers panel, 
that specific adjustment’s options appear in the Properties panel. (Selecting the 
adjustment through the Layers menu presents you with the New Layer dialog box 
first.)
The top three options in the menu that you open from the Layers panel are fill 
layers — layers completely filled with a color, gradient, or pattern. You can add a 
new empty layer and choose Edit ➪ Fill to do the same thing, or you can add such 
a layer through the Layer ➪ New Fill Layer menu. (Note that these three options 
are not available through the Adjustment panel.)
Limiting your adjustments
When your image has multiple layers and you want to apply an adjustment layer 
to only one layer, the new adjustment layer must be clipped — restricted to the one 
layer immediately below it in the Layers panel. (That’s the layer that’s active when 
you add the adjustment layer.) You can clip it to the layer below by Option+clicking/
Alt+clicking the line between the two layers in the Layers panel (which is also 
how you unclip a pair of layers). Figure  8-19 shows the difference between a 
clipped adjustment layer (left) and an unclipped adjustment layer (right). When 

CHAPTER 8  Fine-Tuning Your Fixes     183
unclipped, the adjustment is applied to all the layers below rather than to the one 
layer immediately below. When adding an adjustment layer through the Layers 
menu, select the Use Previous Layer to Create Clipping Mask option.
On the left side of Figure 8-19, the Hue/Saturation adjustment is applied only to 
the upper layer — the layer named Symbol. On the right, the adjustment layer 
isn’t clipped, so it changes both the Symbol layer and the Background layer. By 
the way, the thumbnail in the Layers panel shows the Symbol layer’s original cop-
per color prior to the addition of the Hue/Saturation adjustment layer. Among the 
beauties of using adjustment layers is the joy you might feel when the client says, 
“Yup, you were right — let’s go back to the original design.”
But what if you want an adjustment layer to change, say, three of the layers in 
your image? Create a layer group from the layers (click the New Group button 
at the bottom of the Layers panel and drag the layers into the Group icon in the 
panel), add the adjustment layer within the group and above the layers in the 
group, and change the layer group’s blending mode from Pass Through to Normal 
at the top of the Layers panel. The adjustment layer, within the layer group and at 
the top of the layer group, is applied to all your layers in the group and only the 
layers in that group.
Because they’re layers, you can use a layer mask to apply the adjustment layer to 
only part of your layer. You may find it easier to make a selection of the area where 
you want the adjustment before selecting the adjustment layer — the mask will be 
automatically created from the selection.

Common Problems 
and Their Cures
S
ometimes you take perfect photos of imperfect people, and sometimes you 
take imperfect photos of, well, imperfect people. (Even the top models ben-
efit from a little Photoshopping.) Although capturing absolute reality is the 
goal of some artists and most photojournalists, the people in your photos probably 
prefer to look as good as you (and Photoshop) can make them look.
In this chapter, I present you with some basic techniques for curing many of 
the most common problems that you encounter as a photographer. I show you 
how to remove that spooky red-eye effect that appears when your camera’s flash 
reflects off the blood vessels in the back of a subject’s eyes. I also show you tricks 
for removing wrinkles, whitening teeth, and tightening waistlines. Digital noise 
(those distracting red, green, and blue pixels scattered in your image’s shadows) 
is easy to minimize when you use the tricks here. I cover how to remove some 
larger problems from images using the almost-magical Content-Aware Fill and 
show you how to work with Puppet Warp. At the end of the chapter you’ll learn 
how to fix problems with perspective, rotation, and barrel distortion in photos. 
Throughout this chapter, I use real-world examples — the types of photos with 
which you’re most likely to work. (After all, you probably don’t get to shoot beau-
tiful models all the time.)

Making People Prettier
You can do lots of things in Photoshop to improve your images, but few are appre-
ciated as much as fixing a person’s photographed flaws (the appearance kind, not 
their bad habits). Whether it’s a studio portrait or a snapshot, the people in your 
images generally can benefit from a little touching up.
Although you can theoretically make almost anyone look truly beautiful and glam-
orous using Photoshop, remember to balance improving with reality. Always work 
on a copy of your image. I also recommend saving separate copies at different 
stages during the editing process. The client might say that he wants the braces 
removed from his teeth, but after you present the finished product, he might just 
(gasp!) change his mind.
Getting the red out . . . digitally
When a subject looks directly into the camera and the camera-mounted flash fires, 
the result is often red-eye. This result is caused when light (such as a flash) bounces 
off the blood vessels at the back of an 
eye, and it gives the subject a spooky 
vampire look. Among the many ways 
to minimize this problem is with the 
Red Eye tool, nested in the Toolbox 
with the healing and patch tools. Zoom 
in and drag a small rectangle over the 
iris and pupil to watch the red disap-
pear, leaving the natural highlights 
and a perfect eye. As you see to the 
right in Figure 9-1, the default settings 
are good for typical cases of red-eye.
The Red Eye tool finds red and not green. For green-eye (in photos of animals), 
for too-bright white reflections from eyes, and for those times when you’re 
not happy with the performance of the Red Eye tool, you can use the Camera 
Raw filter. The Red Eye Removal tool in the Camera Raw filter offers Pet Eye, as 
shown in Figure 9-2. You can also use the Brush tool to remove red eye or green 
eye problems.). Set the foreground color to black; on the Options bar, select the 
Normal blending mode and an Opacity of about 75%. Use a brush diameter just 
slightly larger than the pupil and a brush hardness of about 85%. Click once and 
evaluate the result; if necessary, reduce the Opacity to 20% and click again.
Here’s one more red-eye/green-eye trick: Use the Sponge tool to desaturate, fol-
lowed by the Burn tool (Midtones, 25% exposure). The Sponge tool is nested in the 
Toolbox with the Dodge and Burn tools.
FIGURE 9-1:

the right, the result.

CHAPTER 9  Common Problems and Their Cures     187
The digital fountain of youth
In Chapter 6, I show an example of using the Dodge tool to fade wrinkles without 
removing them completely. Photoshop, being a complex and capable animal, has 
lots of other ways to minimize or eliminate wrinkles. Among the most powerful 
tools for this job are the Healing Brush, the Spot Healing Brush (especially with 
the Content-Aware option), the Patch tool (also with the Content-Aware option), 
and the Clone Stamp.
Both the Healing Brush and the Patch tool work by copying texture from one 
area to another. You can, for example, overlay smooth skin texture onto a wrin-
kled area, smoothing the wrinkles while retaining the area’s general tonality and 
color. To work with the Healing Brush, Option+click (Mac)/Alt+click (Windows) 
the area from which you want to copy texture, and then click and drag over the 
area that you’re fixing. When you select the Aligned option from the Options bar, 
you maintain the relationship between the point from which you’re healing and 
the area over which you drag. No matter where you move the cursor, the source 
point retains the same distance and direction. When repairing areas of a face, 
however, you might find it easier to deselect the Aligned check box. Every time 
you release the mouse button, you start over from the same source point. By using 
short strokes, you can heal from the same source area to any area of your image.
The Spot Healing Brush works much like the Healing Brush to repair and replace tex-
ture. However, instead of designating a source point by Option+clicking/Alt+clicking, 
the Spot Healing Brush samples from the immediate surrounding area, which makes 
it perfect for repairing little irregularities in an area of rather consistent texture. 
The Content-Aware option for the Spot Healing Brush makes it a “smart” tool — it 
looks at the surrounding area and tries to replicate both the texture and the content.
To work with the Patch tool, make a selection with the Patch tool (or with any 
of Photoshop’s selection features) and then drag with the Patch tool. Depending 
FIGURE 9-2:

188     PART 2  Easy Enhancements for Digital Images
on which option you select from the Options bar, you can either select and drag 
the damaged area to a good area (select Source from the Options bar), or you can 
select a good area and drag to the damaged area (select Destination). You can use 
both the Healing Brush and the Patch tool to apply a predefined pattern, too. That 
can be handy for adding a texture where one doesn’t already exist in your image.
Like the Healing Brush, you Option+click/Alt+click with the Clone Stamp to set the 
area from which you’re copying and then paint over an area to make a change. 
The Healing Brush copies texture, but the Clone Stamp copies pixels, completely 
replacing the area over which you drag. (That is, of course, subject to the blending 
mode and opacity that you select from the Options bar.) Like the Healing Brush, 
the Clone Stamp offers the Aligned option. Outside the eye in Figure 9-3 shows a 
comparison of wrinkle reduction using the Clone Stamp (set to Normal and 100% 
Opacity) and using the Healing Brush. (If you use the Clone Stamp to repair skin, 
reduce the opacity and make sure to select a source area that has similar skin 
color and lighting.) Also on the Clone Stamp’s Options bar, you have the choice 
of working on the active layer (ignoring pixels on other layers), working on the 
active layer and the layer immediately below (which you’ll choose when you add 
an empty layer to hold your cloned pixels), or using all layers in the image (helpful 
in layered images with areas of transparency and adjustment layers).

Dieting digitally
You can certainly use the Clone Stamp 
tool to reduce a bit of a bulge at the 
waistline or below an upper arm, but 
you might find it easier (and more 
natural-looking) to make a selection 
and rotate the outer edge inward a bit. 
Take a look at Figure  9-4. Although 
this subject hardly has what you’d 
call a “spare tire,” that bit of extra 
sticking out above her skirt isn’t par-
ticularly flattering. Make a selection with the Lasso tool that includes some of 
the background and some skin (or shirt or dress). Copy the selection to a new 
layer with ⌘  +J/Ctrl+J.  Press ⌘  +T/Ctrl+T to enter Free Transform (or choose 
Edit ➪ Transform ➪ Rotate). Drag the point of rotation (the little crosshair symbol 
in the middle of the bounding box) to the top of the bounding box, and then posi-
tion the cursor slightly outside the bounding box and drag to rotate. When you’re 
satisfied, press Return/Enter to accept the transformation and merge the layers 
with ⌘  +E/Ctrl+E. (With complex backgrounds, you might need to do a little clon-
ing to even things out.)
When working with double chins, your best bet is usually to minimize rather than 
eliminate. Putting a skinny neck under a fleshy face looks unnatural. You can 
certainly tuck in the sides of the second chin a bit by using the rotate method, but 
rely on the Burn tool to darken. By darkening the excess flesh under the chin, you 
make it appear to be in shadow — and, 
therefore, under the actual chin. (See 
Figure 9-5.) Use the Dodge tool or the 
Clone Stamp (if necessary) to hide any 
creases or wrinkles associated with 
the excess chin. Redefine a natural-
looking jaw line and chin — but once 
again, remember that the result must 
not only be acceptable to the client; it 
must also look natural.
When working with the Burn and Dodge tools, don’t forget to reduce the Exposure 
setting on the Options bar — 15% to 20% is plenty strong for this type of work. 
You’ll also want to juggle between Highlights and Midtones (the Range setting 
on the Options bar) when creating an artificial shadow on a double chin with the 
Burn tool. Zoom in when doing this sort of work, but also open a second window 
via Window ➪ Arrange ➪ New Window for [filename] to keep an eye on the overall 
impact of your changes.

190     PART 2  Easy Enhancements for Digital Images
You can use the Filter ➪ Liquify feature to push, pull, twist, pucker, bloat, and 
otherwise manipulate pixels into the shape and position you need. There’s really 
nothing more powerful when it comes to reconfiguring a figure. In Figure 9-6, 
you see how leveling off a beltline with Liquify is sometimes all that’s needed to 
restore that trim-man-she-married look. And a little touch-up with the Healing 
Brush or Dodge and Burn tools can eliminate the wrinkles in the shirt, helping 
improve the overall appearance of the image by reducing distraction. (Chapter 15 
has full info on using Liquify.)
De-glaring glasses
Although hindsight is usually 20/20, many people need spectacles. Unfortunately, 
those eyeglasses can be a photographer’s nightmare! The reflections off glass are 
usually specular highlights — that is, areas of pure white with absolutely no detail in 
them. To properly evaluate flash reflections in eyeglasses, open the Info panel and 
move the cursor through the area. If you see a noticeable variation among the RGB 
values in the Info panel, you might be able to restore the area with the Burn tool.
If the Info panel shows RGB values of 255/255/255 or close to it, the area has no 
detail. Zoom in close and use the Clone Stamp tool to copy over the area from 
another part of the image. In severe cases of glare, you might need to copy from 
another photo of the same person. When possible (say, in a portrait sitting), try to 
take one shot of the subject without eyeglasses, just in case.
FIGURE 9-6: 
The original 
beltline is 
shown to the 
lower left.

CHAPTER 9  Common Problems and Their Cures     191
Whitening teeth
Teeth generally aren’t truly white (unless somebody has spent a lot of time and 
money getting ready for a portfolio shoot). Instead, you see shades of ivory and 
yellow in teeth, but they don’t necessarily have to be unattractive or distracting 
shades of yellow. The Sponge tool is great for desaturating teeth, moving them 
from yellow to gray. Use the Dodge tool to lighten teeth. From the Options bar, set 
the tool to Midtones (not Highlights) and an Exposure of perhaps 30% for front 
teeth. Paint over each tooth individually, making sure that you don’t eliminate 
the shadows that differentiate the individual teeth. Then switch to Shadows and 
lighten those molars visible in back. Don’t overdo it — remember that folks who 
don’t make their living in Hollywood 
or on TV generally don’t have snow-
white teeth. Figure  9-7 shows nor-
mal people teeth, “improved” normal 
people teeth, and Hollywood teeth. 
Balance your judgment with the cli-
ent’s needs.
Reducing Noise in Your Images
The move from the darkroom to digital may have saved you thousands of dollars 
in film and processing costs (not to mention a reduction in possible environmen-
tal pollution), but has added a new set of challenges to the art and business of 
photography. Perhaps foremost among the problems presented by digital photog-
raphy is noise. Those pesky red, green, and blue (or light and dark) specks in an 
image can ruin a digital photo. Noise is generally most prominent in shadow areas 
and against dark colors in your images.
The higher the ISO setting on your camera, the more digital noise it will record. 
Use the lowest ISO setting that’s suitable for the environment in which you’re 
shooting. When you must use a high ISO (low light, moving subject), be prepared 
for digital noise. Using a tripod can also help keep the problem to a minimum.
Decreasing digital noise
If you shoot Raw, reduce noise in Camera Raw, as described in Chapter 7. If you 
shoot JPEG, apply Camera Raw as a filter or use the Reduce Noise filter (under the 
Filter ➪ Noise menu). As you see in Figure 9-8, Reduce Noise does a very good job 
of neutralizing the random red, green, and blue pixels while preserving detail in 
the image.
FIGURE 9-7: 
Coffee and caps; Dodge tool digital correction; 
show-biz-white teeth.

192     PART 2  Easy Enhancements for Digital Images
Notice that Reduce Noise also offers a Remove JPEG Artifact option. When saving 
in the JPEG file format, you compromise between image quality and smaller file 
size. The smaller the file, the greater the likelihood of compression damage to 
your image. That damage generally shows itself as visible lines between blocks of 
pixels measuring eight pixels square.
You’ll also find the Color Replacement tool very handy for noise reduction, espe-
cially in areas of rather uniform color. Option+click/Alt+click right in the area to 
set the foreground color; then simply paint away the digital noise. As you move 
from area to area in your image, Option+click/Alt+click to pick up a new fore-
ground color.
Eliminating luminance noise
In addition to the red, green, and blue specks of digital noise, you might face lumi-
nance noise, the bright and dark specks sprinkled throughout your photo. Under the 
Filter ➪ Noise menu, you can find the Despeckle command. No dialog box appears 
and you have no options to choose from. You simply run the filter two or three 
times. For more challenging noise, try Photoshop’s Blur ➪ Smart Blur filter or 
work with the Camera Raw filter. (If Smart Blur is grayed out in the Filter ➪ Blur 
menu, convert the image to 8-bit color through the Image ➪ Mode menu.) For 
supreme control over blurring, Smart Blur even lets you enter fractions for both 
the Radius and Threshold values (as shown in Figure 9-9).

CHAPTER 9  Common Problems and Their Cures     193
Fooling Around with Mother Nature
Sometimes a very nice photo has something in it that you want gone . . . a piece 
of litter, telephone lines in the distance, or perhaps a building that distracts from 
the composition. Other times, everything in the image is fine, but the image looks 
wrong because of the angle at which it was taken, or you want to change the angle 
of something in the photo. Photoshop offers you quite a variety of tools and tech-
niques for cutting out, copying over, cleaning up, and even correcting perspective.
Removing the unwanted from photos
Perhaps the easiest way to remove something from an image is to crop the photo, 
that is, cut off that part of the picture as explained in Chapter 4. This technique 
is easy enough if that piece of litter or whatever happens to be at the edge of the 
image and cropping won’t ruin your composition. (Of course, picking up that piece 
of litter and disposing of it prior to taking the photo is the best solution.) When 
you must cover up rather than crop out, consider the very powerful Content-
Aware option for Edit ➪ Fill.
Content-Aware Fill analyzes the pixels within a selection and compares them to 
pixels elsewhere in the image, and then re-creates the area within the selection. 
(Making selections to isolate part of an image is discussed in Chapter  8.) In 
Figure  9-10, the waterfall within the selection is both natural and normal. 
However, it does visually water down (pun intended!) the message of “Motion: 
Horizontal and Vertical.” With a single waterfall, the single railroad train is better 
balanced.
FIGURE 9-9: 
The Smart Blur 
filter is a good 
choice for lumi-
nance noise 
reduction.

194     PART 2  Easy Enhancements for Digital Images
When you’re not satisfied with Content-Aware Fill, undo and try changing the 
size of the selection, perhaps including a bit more (or less) of the surrounding 
image. You can also use the Clone Stamp tool to do some touching up after using 
Content-Aware Fill.
If Content-Aware Fill is picking up areas of the image that aren’t appropriate for 
the fix, try this:
1.	 Make a selection of the area you want to remove.
Generally speaking, you’ll use the Lasso tool, but any selection tool or com-
mand can be used.
2.	 Hold down the Shift key and select the pixels you want to use to replace 
the problem area.
The Shift key adds the new selection to the existing selection. This selection 
should include an area of “good” pixels that’s somewhat larger than the area of 
“bad” pixels you want to replace.
3.	 Copy to a new layer.
Use the keyboard shortcut ⌘  +J/Ctrl+J to put the selected pixels on their own 
layer.
FIGURE 9-10: 
The original 
photo (left); 
using Content-
Aware Fill in 
the selected 
area (right).

CHAPTER 9  Common Problems and Their Cures     195
4.	 Reselect the problem area.
This can be a very loose selection, including some of the transparent pixels 
around the problem area. Select only the problem area, not the pixels you 
want to use for the repair.
5.	 Choose Edit ➪ Fill with the Content-Aware option.
Only the unselected pixels on the new layer will be used to replace the 
problem area.
You can also move something in your image to a new location to create a new 
look in the shot. As shown in Figure 9-11, copy the entire image, reposition it, use 
a layer mask to hide parts of the upper layer, and clone to remove anything not 
needed on the exposed areas of the lower layer. In Figure 9-11, the background 
layer is copied and moved upward (after using the Image ➪ Canvas Size command 
to expand the canvas), and a layer mask hides everything except the boy, his 
racket, and the ball. On the lower layer, the boy is cloned out. (The look of surprise 
from the boy in the red hat in the background is simply a fortuitous coincidence 
that seems to add credibility to the adjusted image.)
The Edit ➪ Puppet Warp feature, like Liquify (presented in Chapter 15), enables 
you to very easily produce complex distortions in an image. Here’s the workflow I 
recommend for most jobs using Puppet Warp:
1.	 Make a selection of the area of the image you want to alter.
You can use whatever selection technique works best for the part of the image 
that needs to be selected — Lasso tool, Color Range command, or any of the 
selection tools and techniques described in Chapter 8.
FIGURE 9-11: 
One small step 
for Photoshop, 
one giant leap 
for mankind!

196     PART 2  Easy Enhancements for Digital Images
2.	 Copy to a new layer.
Use the keyboard shortcut ⌘  +J/Ctrl+J to put the selected pixels on their 
own layer.
3.	 Remove the selected pixels from the lower layer.
Hide the upper layer by clicking the eyeball icon to the left of the layer name in 
the Layers panel. Click the lower layer in the panel to make it the active layer. 
Clone or copy/paste or use Content-Aware Fill over the selected pixels using 
the techniques in the preceding section. (This stage of the workflow is shown 
to the upper right, next to the original shot, in Figure 9-12.)
4.	 Make the upper layer visible and active.
Click in the eyeball column to the left of the upper layer’s name to make 
the layer visible, and then click the layer name or thumbnail to make the 
layer active.
5.	 Activate the Puppet Warp feature.
Choose Edit ➪ Puppet Warp.
6.	 Set pins.
Click in two or more places along the axis that you want to change to set 
anchor points known as pins. If you’re manipulating an arm, you would 
generally place pins at the shoulder, elbow, and wrist. When manipulating a 
leg, place pins at the hip, knee, and ankle.

CHAPTER 9  Common Problems and Their Cures     197
7.	 Select your options.
On the Options bar, choose a mode. Normal is usually appropriate, Distort 
enables you to change perspective while dragging pins, and Rigid helps 
maintain special relationships. You can also change the density of the now-
visible mesh and use the Expansion slider and field to expand or contract the 
content within the mesh.
8.	 Drag the pins and accept the warp.
Click a pin to make it the active pin; drag as desired. You can switch among 
pins as often as necessary, and you can remove a pin by clicking it and pressing 
Delete/Backspace. To the right on the Options bar, you’ll see three buttons that 
remove all pins, cancel Puppet Warp, and accept the transformation. When 
you’re happy with the new look of your “puppet,” click that third button or 
press the Return/Enter key.
Eliminating the lean: Fixing perspective
When you take a photograph at an angle, perhaps shooting upward at a building, 
you get foreshortening (also called keystoning), with the upper part of the subject 
shrinking into the distance. If you shoot Raw, you can work with the Camera Raw 
Transform tool (see Chapter 7). If you shoot on a recent-model high-end DSLR, 
Camera Raw may show a custom profile created for your camera/lens combination 
to correct many lens-related vagaries. You can use the buttons and sliders below 
to fine-tune the adjustment if necessary. Generally speaking, if you want to work 
with Camera Raw, you do so before opening the image in Photoshop. However, 
you may find it convenient to use Camera Raw as a filter (perhaps as a Smart Filter 
with a Smart Object so that the adjustments can later be readjusted).
With JPEG images, as an alternative to using Camera Raw as a filter, Photoshop’s 
Filter ➪ Lens Correction does a great job of fixing perspective. If Photoshop can 
determine the make and model of your camera and lens, the Auto tab may have a 
great correction. If not, in the Custom panel of Lens Correction, drag the Vertical 
Perspective slider to the left to correct images shot from below, or to the right for 
shots from above. In Lens Correction, as shown in Figure 9-13, you can also adjust 
horizontal perspective, barrel distortion (when the center of the image bulges out), 
pin cushioning (when the center of the image bulges in), and chromatic aberration 
(blue/yellow or red/cyan fringing along edges), as well as add a vignette.
Before entering Lens Correction, double-click the layer named Background in the 
Layers panel and rename the layer or click the Lock icon to the right of the layer 
name. Use Image ➪ Canvas Size to add some empty area all around the image. 
That way, you won’t chop off any of the photo when dragging the perspective 
sliders. Notice in Figure 9-13 that a generous amount of extra canvas was added, 
which can easily be cropped off after correcting perspective.

198     PART 2  Easy Enhancements for Digital Images
You can also use Photoshop’s Edit ➪ Transform ➪ Perspective command, but 
that usually produces some foreshortening of the image, requiring you to scale 
it upward a bit afterward. The Perspective Crop tool (nested in the Toolbox with 
the Crop tool) can also fix perspective. For best results, position the four corners 
of the bounding box on visible corners of something in the image that should be 
rectangular or square; drag the side handles outward to expand the bounding box 
to encompass your image. Press Return/Enter when you’re done.
Also found in the Filter menu is Adaptive Wide Angle, another way to compensate 
for vagaries of specific wide-angle and fisheye lenses. When Lens Correction’s 
Remove Distortion slider isn’t enough to correct barrel distortion, try Adap-
tive Wide Angle. If the camera model and lens information can be read from the 
image’s metadata (it will be shown in the lower-left corner), the Auto adjustment 
is applied. When the camera and/or lens is unknown, can choose from the other 
adjustment options (shown in Figure 9-14), which you use to manually adjust the 
image.
Rotating images precisely
While it’s certainly possible to rotate an image while working with the Crop tool 
and the Lens Correction filter, you have another, very precise option. With the 
Crop tool selected, try the Straighten button. Click the button, then in the image 
window, click and hold down the mouse button (or trackpad or whatever you’re 
using) and drag a line along something in the image that should be vertical or 
horizontal.
FIGURE 9-13: 
The original is 
shown to the 
lower left.

CHAPTER 9  Common Problems and Their Cures     199
Buried under the Eyedropper in the Photoshop Toolbox is the little-known Ruler 
tool. Generally, you use it in conjunction with the Info panel or Options Bar to 
find distances and angles in your image. You can also use it to make sure that 
you apply the exact amount of rotation needed for your image. Select the Ruler 
tool, drag it along any line in your image that should be vertical or horizontal and 
then choose Image ➪ Image Rotation ➪ Arbitrary. The angle of the Ruler tool will 
already be waiting for you in the dialog box, so you need only click OK to precisely 
rotate your image.
One final thought for this chapter: When you come across an image that requires 
more fixing than you have time for, or one with such severe luminance noise that 
smoothing removes too much detail, or just a problem photo in general, make 
sure that the image is in 8-bit mode (check the Edit ➪ Mode menu), and head for 
the Filter Gallery. It’s amazing how many flaws you can hide with a few artistic 
effects. Creating an artistic rendering of an image is often preferable to deleting 
a lousy photo. Blur away the noise and add a canvas texture with the Texturizer 
filter. Blown out highlights? Try the Colored Pencil filter. (Read more about the 
Filter Gallery in Chapter 15.) When faced with lemons, think of the Filter Gallery 
as your own personal lemonade stand.

A 
pharaoh’s head on a lion’s body. A lion with the head, talons, and wings 
of an eagle. As evidenced by the sphinx and the mythological griffin, 
compositing elements has been around a lot longer than Photoshop, but 
Photoshop certainly makes it easier! Take part of one image, drop it onto another 
image, and sell the composite to the tabloids for thousands of dollars. (One of 
the most infamous misuses of image compositing occurred during the 2004 U.S. 
presidential campaign, with the publication of a fake photo of candidate John 
Kerry with actress and antiwar activist Jane Fonda. That incident pretty much 
shut the door on this sort of Photoshop hijinks in major media.) Photoshop offers 
you incredible power — use it wisely!
In this chapter, I show you some basic techniques for compositing (combining two

ments, the trick is making the composited image look natural. The key techniques 
are blending the edges of your selections and matching color among the elements.
Understanding layers
When you put together images, you work with layers. Think of layers in Photoshop 
as stackable elements, each of which holds part of your image. Where an upper 
layer is transparent, the lower layer or layers show through. Where the upper 
layer has pixels that aren’t transparent, those pixels either block or interact with 
pixels on the lower layer. (You control that interaction with blending modes and 
opacity, explained later in this chapter.)
Take a look at Figure 10-1 (which reveals how Figure 13-3 is created). The Layers 
panel shows the individual layers and their content. The individual elements come 
together to create a single image.
You can manipulate the content of each layer independently — moving, resizing, 
erasing, painting, or adjusting color and tonality — to suit your needs and artistic 
vision. Remember to click a layer in the Layers panel to make that layer active for 
editing. The Move tool’s Options bar offers the option Auto-Select: Layer (and 
FIGURE 10-1: 
Elements on 
different layers 
form a single 
image.

CHAPTER 10  Combining Images     205
Auto-Select: Group), which enables you to make a layer (or group) active by click-
ing any visible pixels on that layer (or in that group).
You can link two or more layers so that they maintain their positions relative to 
each other as you move them. (⌘  /Ctrl+click to select the layers in the Layers 
panel; then click the Link button at the bottom of the Layers panel — a Link sym-
bol appears to the right of linked layers when active in the Layers panel.) Linked 
layers can be moved together without knocking them out of alignment.
The left column in the Layers panel, known as the eyeball column (for an obvious 
reason) allows you to hide a layer, making the content of the layer invisible. The 
pixels are still there; they’re just not visible. Click the eyeball icon to hide the layer 
and then click the empty space in the left column to make the layer visible again. 
You can hide and show adjustment layers, too, which lets you see their impact on 
the image. (Read about adjustment layers in Chapter 8.)
When working with complex images containing many layers, you can use the fil-
tering buttons and the menu at the top of the Layers panel (which shows Kind 
by default) to show only certain layers — perhaps only the type or adjustment 
layers in the image. You can also isolate layers by selecting one or more layers 
in the Layers panel and selecting from the filtering menu at the top-right of the 
Layers panel or by choosing Select ➪ Isolate Layers. Only the isolated layer(s) are 
visible in the Layers panel and can be edited. To restore all the layers, deselect Iso-
late Layers in the Select menu, switch the filtering menu back to Kind, or right-
clicking the isolated layers and select Remove from Isolation. You can also choose 
Select ➪ All Layers to show the entire content of the Layers panel.
One key concept about layers is well illustrated in Figure 10-1. The higher a layer 
is in the stacking order (the order of layers in the panel from the top down), the 
more “in front” it will be. The layers Clouds-Dark and Clouds-Light are on top of 
everything in the image. The layer Man is in front of everything except the clouds. 
Because of the stacking order, the man appears to be standing on top of the musi-
cal notes, and the notes appear to be on top of the DVD.
You can also create groups, which are two or more layers packaged together in the 
Layers panel so that you can show or hide them together. As you can see in the 
Layers panel in Figure 10-1, you can have nested groups: a group within a group. 
The group named Background Items includes another group, named Sun, as well 
as several layers that aren’t part of the Sun subgroup.
Video layers can also be added to your projects, but generally speaking, you’re 
more likely to add regular pixel layers, type layers, shapes, and adjustment layers 
to a video project than to add video layers to another sort of project. Working with 
video is discussed in Chapter 17.

206     PART 3  Creating “Art” in Photoshop
Why you should use Smart Objects
Smart Objects provide you with additional flexibility in Photoshop. When working 
with Smart Objects, you preserve your editing options without risk to the image 
quality. For example, you can transform a Smart Object as often as you like because 
each time you rotate or scale or otherwise manipulate a Smart Object, Photoshop 
goes back to the original pixels and resamples again. This prevents the sort of 
image degradation — especially loss of fine detail — in the image you would see 
if you were to shrink, enlarge, or rotate a regular layer’s content numerous times.
When working with Smart Objects, you can apply a filter to a selection in Pho-
toshop and then later go back and change the filter settings or even remove the 
filter entirely. But this feature is available only when you’re working with Smart 
Objects. Again, it goes back to Photoshop’s ability to return to the original source 
pixels when working with Smart Objects. (Filters are discussed in Chapter 15.) In 
the Layers panel, Smart Filters very much resemble layer styles: You can click an 
eyeball icon to temporarily hide a filter’s effect, and you can double-click the filter 
name to reopen the dialog box so that you can make changes. (See Figure 10-2.)
If you want to apply a Smart Filter to only a section of a Smart Object, make a 
selection before selecting the filter. In keeping with the whole concept of “smart,” 
the filter is applied to the entire Smart Object but the filter’s visibility is controlled 
with a mask. (An empty filter mask is visible to the left of the words Smart Filter 
in the Layers panel in Figure 10-2.) And, of course, you can — at any time — paint 
in the mask with black, white, and shades of gray to alter where the filter is vis-
ible. (Painting in masks is discussed later in this chapter.) Note, too, that a Smart 
Object can have both Smart Filters and a layer style.
FIGURE 10-2: 
Filters applied 
to the Smart 
Object are 
listed under 
Smart Filters.

CHAPTER 10  Combining Images     207
When you choose File ➪ Place Embedded or Place Linked, a Smart Object is auto-
matically created. To create a Smart Object from an existing layer (even a Back-
ground layer), choose Layer ➪ Smart Objects ➪ Convert to Smart Object. When you 
choose Place Embedded, a copy of the placed image is added to your working 
document. When you choose Place Linked, the file itself is not added to your docu-
ment; only a line of info in the document’s metadata noting the location of the 
placed image.
If you link a placed document and later move it on your drive or to another drive 
or change its name, the link is broken and when you re-open the document into 
which you placed the image, it can’t be found. Also keep in mind that if you send 
the document to another person you’ll need to include the linked file. While 
embedding a placed image increases the size of the working document, it can 
avoid all sorts of problems that can arise from linking a placed document.
When working with Raw images, hold down the Shift key and Camera Raw’s Open 
Image button changes to Open Object. If you want Open Object to be the default, 
click the line of image info below the preview (between the Save Image and Open 
Image buttons) to open Workflow Options. That’s also where you specify the 
default color profile and bit depth of images opened through Camera Raw.
Using the basic blending modes
The pop-up menu near the upper-left corner of the Layers panel offers more than 
two dozen different blending modes. A layer’s blending mode determines how the 
pixels on that layer interact with the visible pixels on the layers below.
Because a layer named Background can’t have any layers below it, you can’t 
change the blending mode of background layers. Convert a background layer to a 
regular layer by clicking the Lock icon to the right of the layer name.
In Figure 10-3, the black-white and rainbow strips of gradients overlaid on the 
garden photo below each use the blending mode shown by the text outline. (You can 
see the original gradients in the Normal stripe.) Normal, Multiply, Screen, Over-
lay, and Luminosity are the blending modes you’re most likely to use regularly.
When working with layer blending modes, always keep in mind that you can use 
the Layers panel’s Opacity and Fill sliders to help determine the layer’s visibility 
and appearance. The Opacity slider controls the visibility of the layer’s content 
and any layer style applied to the layer. The Fill slider controls the visibility of 
the layer content without hiding any layer style. For a practical example of the 
difference between the two sliders, take a look at the section “Opacity, fill, and 
advanced blending” in Chapter 12.

208     PART 3  Creating “Art” in Photoshop
The Layers panel blending mode pop-up menu is divided into six sections, based 
loosely on how the pixels on the upper layer affect the pixels on the lower layer. 
Here’s a quick look at how you use the key layer-blending modes:
»
» Normal: Photoshop picks Normal by default. Pixels on the upper layer 
completely hide the pixels on the lower layers (subject, of course, to the 
Opacity and the Fill settings). Use Normal to show the content of the layer 
without any interaction with lower layers.
»
» Multiply: The Multiply blending mode darkens where your upper layer is dark 
and ignores white. Use Multiply when you want the upper layer to darken but 
not obscure the lower layer and also for shadows and dark glow effects.
»
» Screen: The Screen blending mode — the opposite of Multiply — uses lighter 
pixels to lighten the pixels below. Use it for highlights and light-colored glows.
»
» Overlay: Overlay works like a combination of Multiply and Screen. Use it 
when you’re working with an upper layer that includes both dark and light 
pixels that you want to interact with pixels on layers below.
»
» Soft Light: Soft Light is a subtle blending mode. Like Overlay, where your 
upper layer’s pixels are dark, the lower layer is darkened; where they’re light, 
the lower layer is lightened. Soft Light is like adding a diffused spotlight to the 
lower layer — useful for adding a little drama to the lower layer.
»
» Hard Light: The Hard Light blending mode is much like a more vivid version 
of Soft Light. Use it to add a lot more drama to the lower layer. Hard Light 
works well with colors that aren’t overwhelmingly bright.
FIGURE 10-3: 
Blending 
modes control 
the interaction 
between the 
gradients and 
the photo.

CHAPTER 10  Combining Images     209
»
» Difference: Where the upper layer (using the Difference blending mode) and 
the lower layer are exactly the same, you see black. Where the two layers are 
different, you see brightness or color. For example, use Difference (temporar-
ily) when trying to align two overlapping photos. Set the upper layer to 
Difference, move the upper layer until the areas of overlap show black, and 
then switch the upper layer’s blending mode back to Normal.
»
» Color: When the upper layer is set to Color, the lower layer’s brightness and 
saturation are retained, and the upper layer’s color is used. If you want to 
create a color picture from a grayscale picture, convert the image to RGB 
(choose Image ➪ Mode ➪ RGB), add a new layer, change the upper layer’s 
blending mode to Color, and paint on the upper layer (as shown in 
Figure 10-4).
»
» Luminosity: When the upper layer is set to Luminosity, the color and 
saturation of the lower layer are retained, and the brightness (luminosity) of 
the upper layer is applied. Because the luminosity (dark and light) generally 
provides texture, use this blending mode to produce detail in the lower layer.
Photoshop also offers two pairs of blending modes that you might find useful, 
but confusing. Lighten and Lighter Color compare a pixel on the upper layer to 
the pixel immediately below to determine the resulting color. Lighten chooses the 
higher (brighter) value in each of the RGB color channels and produces a new color 
based on those three independent lightness values. Lighter Color, on the other 
hand, looks at the color on the upper layer created by all three channels, compares 
it to the color on the lower layer, and makes visible whichever of those two colors 
is lighter overall. The Darken and Darker Color blending modes work similarly, 
but choose the darker values.
FIGURE 10-4: 
Paint on a layer 
set to Color 
to retain the 
detail of the 
layer below.

210     PART 3  Creating “Art” in Photoshop
For a look at the rest of Photoshop’s dozens of blending modes, see the appendix.
Opacity, transparency, and layer masks
Blending modes help determine how pixels on an upper layer interact with pixels 
on a lower layer, but those upper pixels have to be visible before they can do any 
interacting at all. When looking at any pixel on a layer, you have to consider four 
factors about transparency:
»
» Whether the pixel has any color to start with
»
» The Opacity value
»
» The Fill value
»
» Whether there’s a layer mask
When you add a layer and paint on it, for example, 
you color some of the pixels yet leave other pixels 
transparent. (Every layer in every image is completely 
filled with pixels, whether visible or not.) If nothing 
is done to color some pixels, they remain transpar-
ent, and the lower layers can be seen through that 
part of your upper layer. In Figure 10-5, the words 
upper layer are on a separate layer above the layer 
containing the words LOWER LAYER. Where the upper 
layer has transparent pixels, the lower layer shows 
through.
A layer named Background in the Layers panel can’t 
have transparent pixels. Simply click the Lock icon to the right of the layer name 
to convert it to a regular layer.
Lowering the Opacity or the Fill slider in the Layers panel (or the Layer Style 
dialog box) makes all visible pixels on the layer partially transparent: The pixels 
on layers below can be seen through the upper layer’s pixels. (The Opacity slider 
controls the pixels on the layer and any layer style; the Fill slider works only on 
the pixels, not the layer style.)
For a “glass text” effect, useful for adding your copyright info over an image 
you don’t want others to use, add the type, add a narrow stroke layer effect and 
perhaps a drop shadow, and then reduce the Fill slider to zero. Flip ahead to 
Chapter 12 for an example (specifically, Figure 12-20).
FIGURE 10-5: 
Where you see the lower layer, 
the upper layer is transparent.

CHAPTER 10  Combining Images     211
Chapter 8 discusses layer masks and vector masks. Remember that any pixel inside 
the mask is at least partially visible, and any pixel outside the mask is transparent, 
regardless of whether it has color. But, as you can guess, any completely transpar-
ent pixels inside the mask remain completely transparent.
Creating clipping groups
This being Photoshop, here is yet another way to restrict the visibility of pixels 
on an upper layer: clipping groups. Clipping an upper layer to the layer below, in 
effect, creates a mask for the upper layer. The opacity of the pixels on the lower 
layer is applied to the pixels on your upper layer. Where the lower layer is trans-
parent, the upper layer (regardless of original content) becomes transparent. In 
the Layers panel, Option+click (Mac)/Alt+click (Windows) the line between two 
layers to clip the upper layer to the lower. When you hold down the Option/Alt 
key, the cursor turns into the icon shown between the two layers in Figure 10-6.
After you Option+click/Alt+click the line between Layer 1 and the type layer, the 
upper layer is visible only within the text on the lower layer. The upper layer is 
indented to the right in the Layers panel, with a downward-pointing arrow to let 
you know that it’s clipped to the layer below. Note that the upper layer’s thumb-
nail in the Layers panel shows the entire layer, not just the visible area. To unclip a 
layer, Option+click/Alt+click again on the line between the two layers in the Layers 
panel. Also note in Figure 10-6 that the layer style is applied to the lower layer 
rather than the upper layer.
FIGURE 10-6: 
Option+click 
or Alt+click the 
line between 
two layers to 
clip the upper 
to the lower.

212     PART 3  Creating “Art” in Photoshop
Photoshop lets you show the layer thumbnails in two ways. Normally, the entire 
layer, including all areas of transparency, shows in the thumbnail. Although that 
gives you a good indication of how large or small the particular layer’s content 
is in the image, layers with little content have little to show in the thumbnail. 
By using the Panel Options (from the Layers panel menu) or Control+clicking/ 
right-clicking the empty area below the layers in the panel, you can elect to show 
a thumbnail that includes only nontransparent areas of the layer. Little things fill 
the thumbnail, but they also appear out of proportion to the other thumbnails. 
Your choice.
Making composited elements look natural
One of the keys to compositing two images is a slight fade to the edges of the ele-
ment you’re adding to the original image. That fade, called feathering, makes the 
edges of the image appear to fall off into the distance very slightly rather than 
having a sharply defined edge that sticks out like a sore thumb. (See Chapter 8 for 
full information on feathering.) You have a number of ways to feather a selection, 
including the following:
»
» Use the Feathering field on the Options bar 
before you use a selection tool.
»
» Use the Select and Mask button on the Options 
bar or the Select ➪ Select and Mask command 
after making your selection.
»
» Choose Select ➪ Modify ➪ Feather after you 
make a selection.
»
» Use one of Photoshop’s Blur filters on a saved 
selection’s alpha channel in the Layers panel (or 
on a layer mask).
Matching color between two layers is also critical 
for a natural appearance. Take a look at Chapter 6 
for full information on Match Color and Photo-
shop’s other color adjustment capabilities.
You also need to be aware of perspective and scale. 
When an element in your composited image seems 
to be too large or too small or when it seems to be 
facing the wrong way or standing on air, rely on 
the Edit ➪ Transform commands. Although the 
Scale and Rotate commands are self-explanatory, 
Figure 10-7 shows visually how you can use the 
FIGURE 10-7: 
Drag anchor points to transform.

CHAPTER 10  Combining Images     213
other Transform commands, such as 
Skew, Perspective, and Warp. Drag 
the bounding box anchor points to 
transform the selected pixels.
The Edit ➪ Transform ➪ Warp com-
mand adds a simple mesh over the 
content of the layer or selection. You 
click and drag the direction lines for the 
corners of the mesh and at the inter-
section of mesh lines to distort your 
artwork. As you see in Figure  10-8,  
the Warp distortion gives you a level 
of control second only to Photo-
shop’s Liquify feature (discussed in 
­Chapter  15). You can also use Warp 
with paths and vector shapes.
Making Complex Selections
In order to combine elements from separate images into a single piece of artwork, 
you sometimes need to make very complex selections. That’s often best done 
with an alpha channel, which can then be made into an active selection with the 
aptly named Select ➪ Load Selection command. Among the alpha channel creation 
techniques available to you are
»
» Save a selection: If you already have a selection, perhaps created with the 
Lasso tool or the Select ➪ Color Range command, you can choose 
Select ➪ Save Selection to create an alpha channel. This saved selection can 
then be edited as necessary by painting, or it can be combined with another 
selection or additional alpha channels.
»
» Duplicate a quick mask: Press Q to enter Quick Mask mode, paint your quick 
mask (as described in Chapter 8), and then — before exiting Quick Mask 
mode — drag the Quick Mask channel to the New Channel button at the 
bottom of the Channels panel to duplicate it.
»
» Paint from scratch: Click the New Channel button at the bottom of the 
Channels panel, and paint with black, white, and shades of gray. White will be 
included in the selection, black will be excluded from the selection, and gray 
indicates partial selection.
FIGURE 10-8: 
Use the Warp transformation to distort layers 
or selections.

» Duplicate an existing channel as the basis for a mask: You can also 
examine the color channels to see which provides the best contrast between 
the subject and the background, drag that channel to the New Channel 
button, and then adjust the duplicate channel.
Duplicating a color channel is often the most effective way to extract a complex 
subject from a complex background. Here’s one way to approach the task:
1.	 Examine each channel individually to see which offers the most contrast 
between subject and background.
Open the Channels panel and click each color channel, one at a time, to see 
which presents the best contrast between the edges of the subject and the 
surrounding background.
Don’t forget that you have 10 color channels — that’s right, 10 channels — 
from which to choose! In addition to the Red, Green, and Blue channels in your 
image, you can choose Image ➪ Duplicate and then convert the copy to CMYK 
or Lab mode. One of the CMYK channels often offers much better contrast 
between subject and background than do the RGB channels. In Lab mode, the 
a and b channels are also worth a try. And after creating your alpha channel, 
you don’t even need to switch back to RGB mode.
2.	 Duplicate the selected channel.
Drag the color channel of your choice to the New Channel button at the 
bottom of the Channels panel to create an alpha channel from it.
3.	 Maximize the contrast between subject and background.
Ideally, you’ll end up with a subject that’s completely white and a background 
that’s completely black. (If your alpha channel shows a dark subject and a light 
background, simply press ⌘  +I/Ctrl+I or choose Image ➪ Adjustments ➪ Invert.) 
Generally speaking, the first place to start maximizing the contrast is Levels. 
Drag the end sliders way in under the middle of the histogram, and then adjust 
the middle slider. After clicking OK, you may want to use Levels again. After 
Levels has done most of the work, grab the Brush tool and clean up any 
additional areas, painting directly in the channel with black and white.
4.	 Load the channel as a selection.
If you duplicated the image and used one of the CMYK or Lab channels to 
create the mask, click the original RGB image to make it the active window. (If 
you used one of the RGB channels, you only have the one version open.) 
Choose Select ➪ Load Selection. You can load an alpha channel from any open 
document of exactly the same pixel dimensions.

CHAPTER 10  Combining Images     215
As you adjust your duplicated channel, pay attention only to the edge between the 
subject and background. Don’t worry about areas away from the edge — those are 
easy to clean up with the Brush. It’s that narrow band that separates the subject 
and background that’s critical.
Figure 10-9 illustrates the steps. To the left, the Red channel shows decent con-
trast between the subject and background, the Green less so, and the Blue channel 
is useless for this particular image (too much yellow in the background). After 
you create a duplicate and convert to CMYK mode, it’s apparent that both the 
Cyan and Black channels are even better starting points than the Red channel. 
After duplicating the Black channel and using Levels twice, the alpha channel is in 
pretty good shape (top center). After a few swipes with the Brush using black and 
then again using white, the alpha channel is ready (top right). Switch back to the 
original RGB image, choose Select ➪ Load Selection and load the Black copy chan-
nel, and there’s a perfect selection of the flower!
When working with Raw images, you have another option available. After making 
the subject look great in Camera Raw, click Open Image to open the image into 
Photoshop, and then save it as .psd or a .tif file. Reopen the original Raw image 
back into Camera Raw. This time, maximize the differences between the edges 
of the subject and background in the Basic and HSL/Grayscale panels — without 
regard for how ugly the image becomes. Hold down the Option/Alt key and click 
the now-visible Open Copy button (which opens the new copy without overwrit-
ing your earlier Camera Raw adjustments). Select a color channel, duplicate the 
channel, and create your alpha channel as described in the preceding section.

fastest way to

channel.

Vanishing Point
When combining images to create a scene, you might find a need to add texture 
or a pattern along what is supposed to be a three-dimensional object. You might, 
for example, add a product box to a photo of a kitchen and need to add a logo to 
the front of the box. Or maybe you will create a room, perhaps in a house high 
on a hill, and you’ll need to add a realistic brick texture to the walls. Use the 
Vanishing Point feature to “map” a pattern to angled surfaces, such as walls, 
floors, buildings, and boxes. Vanishing Point, using information that you provide, 
automatically determines the correct angle, scale, and perspective. You can also 
use the Brush tool to paint in perspective in Vanishing Point. (Vanishing Point is 
rather complex, so for simple jobs, you might want to stick with the Paste and 
Edit ➪ Transform commands.)
To use Vanishing Point, you follow a specific sequence of steps:
1.	 Copy your pattern.
Open whatever pattern file (or texture or logo or whatever) you’re going to 
add to the walls or sides in your image, make a selection, and then choose 
Edit ➪ Copy. You can now close the pattern file.
2.	 Make a selection in your working image.
Identify where you want the pattern to be applied. If you’re working with walls, 
for example, make a selection that includes the walls but doesn’t include 
windows and doors.
3.	 Open Vanishing Point (choose Filter ➪ Vanishing Point).
The Vanishing Point window opens, displaying your image.
4.	 Create planes on your image in the Vanishing Point window:
a.	 Select the Create Plane tool (the second tool from the top on the left edge of 
the window).
b.	 Click in your image where you want to place the three corners of your plane 
and then move the cursor to the fourth corner.
You see the plane extending along the last two sides.
c.	 Click the fourth corner to create the plane.
If the plane is yellow or red rather than blue, it’s not aligned properly. Drag 
the corners of the plane to realign them, using the Edit Plane tool (the top 
tool on the left). Drag the side anchor points outward to expand the plane’s 
mesh to cover the whole wall or side.

CHAPTER 10  Combining Images     217
d.	 Create perpendicular planes by holding down the ⌘  /Ctrl key and dragging 
the side anchor point at the point where the two planes should meet. If the 
second plane should be at an angle other than 90 degrees to the first plane, 
Option+drag/Alt+drag one of the anchor points to rotate the grid.
If the second plane’s angle is off a little, drag one of the corner anchor 
points to adjust it. In Figure 10-10, you see two perpendicular planes.
5.	 Paste your pattern.
a.	 Press ⌘  +V/Ctrl+V to paste your pattern into Vanishing Point.
Your pattern is pasted into the upper-left corner of the Vanishing 
Point window.
b.	 Select the Marquee tool (third from the top) and drag the pattern into 
your plane.
The pattern automatically adopts the orientation of the plane. If necessary, 
click the Transform tool (or press T on your keyboard) and then rotate and 
scale the pattern.
6.	 Replicate the pattern.
Unless your pattern is an exact fit, you need to replicate it to fill the plane. With 
the Marquee tool selected, hold down the Option/Alt key. Then click and drag 
in your pattern to replicate it. Repeat as necessary to fill the plane. As you see 
in Figure 10-11, you can replicate a relatively small pattern to fill a large area.
If the lighting in your original image varies, set the Healing pop-up menu (at the 
top of the window, only with the Marquee tool active) to Luminance. That helps 
maintain the original lighting on the new pattern or texture.
FIGURE 10-10: 
Use the Create 
Planes tool 
to identify 
surfaces.

218     PART 3  Creating “Art” in Photoshop
7.	 Click OK to exit Vanishing Point and apply the pattern or texture to your 
image.
After exiting Vanishing Point, you might need to do some touch-up work on 
your image with the Clone Stamp tool (depending on how precise you were 
when dragging). You might also, depending on the original image, need to add 
a layer and paint some shadows or highlights to reproduce the original lighting 
in the scene.
In Figure 10-11, the pasted and replicated brick pattern doesn’t cover the door, win-
dow, or artwork because they were not selected prior to opening Vanishing Point. 
Without that active selection when opening Vanishing Point, it would have been 
much more difficult to properly align the pattern without covering those areas.
Here are some tips for working with Vanishing Point:
»
» Create accurate planes; then drag. Click in four corners of any identifiable 
area of your plane — perhaps a window — and drag the side anchor points 
outward (or inward) to identify the whole plane.
»
» Press the X key to zoom. Pressing and holding the X key on your keyboard 
makes the preview area zoom to show the area where you’re working. 
Release the X key to zoom back out.
»
» Press T to transform. After pasting your pattern, you can press T on your 
keyboard and then scale and rotate your pasted pattern.
»
» Use the Shift key to drag in alignment. Hold down the Shift key while 
Option+dragging/Alt+dragging to replicate your pattern. That keeps the new 
part aligned to the old.

CHAPTER 10  Combining Images     219
»
» Duplicate elements in the image. Make a selection with the Marquee tool and 
⌘  +Option+drag/Ctrl+Alt+drag to the area where you want to place the copy.

» Paste over objects in Vanishing Point. Create your plane. Use the Marquee 
tool to select an area that you want to replace, and then hold down the ⌘  /Ctrl 
key and drag to an area that you want to paste into the marquee selection.
»
» Clone in Vanishing Point. Define your plane, select the Clone Stamp tool, 
and Option+click/Alt+click at the source point. Release the Option/Alt key and 
move the cursor to the point where you want to start cloning. When the 
preview is properly aligned, click and drag to clone.

» Paint in perspective. With a plane identified, the Brush tool in Vanishing 
Point shrinks or grows in accordance with your perspective plane.

» Work on an empty layer. You can add an empty layer in the Layers panel 
before entering Vanishing Point. Your result is added to the new layer, which 
lets you work with blending modes and opacity to merge your pattern into 
the original.
Creating Panoramas with Photomerge
Sometimes a snapshot doesn’t adequately portray a scene. (It’s hard to capture 
the majesty of the Grand Canyon in a single frame.) For those situations, take a 
series of images and combine them into one large panorama with Photomerge 
(found on the File ➪ Automate menu).
The first step in using Photomerge successfully is taking appropriate photos. Here 
are some tips:
»
» Use a properly leveled tripod. Use a tripod, making sure that the tripod’s 
head is steady and level so the individual photos align properly. If necessary, 
set the legs to different heights.
»
» Turn off auto-exposure. If you use your camera’s auto-exposure feature, 
each image is actually exposed differently because of the lighting in that 
frame. Instead, expose for the center (or most important) photo and use the 
same settings for all shots.
»
» Don’t use auto-focus with zoom lenses. Auto-focus can change the zoom 
factor of the lens. Instead, set the lens to manual focus after using auto-focus 
on your most important shot.

220     PART 3  Creating “Art” in Photoshop
»
» Move or rotate the camera. If you have a long panorama to shoot, say an 
entire city block, you might want to physically move the tripod for each shot. If 
you want a more typical panorama, you’ll leave the tripod in one place and 
rotate the camera between shots.
»
» Overlap by at least 15 percent. Up to one-quarter of each shot (on each 
side) should overlap so that Photomerge can properly align neighboring 
images.
When working with images that are properly exposed and have suitable overlap, 
Photomerge is fully automated. Open Photomerge, select the images you want to 
use, select how you want the component images to interact, click OK, sit back, and 
watch the magic as the elements are put into order, aligned, and blended.
After Photomerge completes its mission, you’re left with a layered image that uses 
layer masks to combine individual photos (one per layer) into a unified whole. 
Each layer is named for the file from which it was created. Typically, you’ll need to 
crop the image a bit to neaten up the edges and remove any areas of transparency.
At the bottom of the Photomerge dialog box you’ll find an option named Content-
Aware Fill Transparent Images. If your panorama ends up with some empty areas 
(perhaps due to camera angle), Phomerge can use Content-Aware Fill to add con-
tent to those areas, using the surrounding pixels.

CHAPTER 11  Precision Edges with Vector Paths     221
Precision Edges with 
Vector Paths
M
ost of the images with which you work in Photoshop — digital photos 
and scanned artwork, layers on which you paint, and filled selections — 
are created with pixels. There’s also another type of artwork: vector art, 
which you create by defining a path (an outline) and adding color within and 
along that path. That path has a very precise edge, enabling vectors (when printed 
appropriately) to give you very crisp, clean lines in your artwork.
Typically, vector art consists of specific elements (objects) that are uniform in 
color (although vector art can also include gradients and patterns). You might 
have, for example, a red triangle, a blue square, and a green circle as your logo 
(boring!). These three solid-color objects are best defined as vector artwork. Vec-
tors, however, are not appropriate for photographic images and other such imag-
ery that include subtle transitions among colors.
In Photoshop, you have tools that create predefined shapes, you have tools that 
create freeform shapes, and you have tools to edit the paths that define those 
shapes. You also have a shape picker and a bunch of menu commands. You can 
even bring in artwork from Adobe Illustrator and create your own shapes, too. 
After reading this chapter, you’ll have a solid understanding of all these bits and 
pieces. I even tell you where to find dozens, or even hundreds, of custom shapes 
already on your computer — absolutely free!

222     PART 3  Creating “Art” in Photoshop
Pixels, Paths, and You
The vast majority of the artwork with which you work (or play) in Photoshop is 
raster artwork. Raster imagery consists of uniformly sized squares of color (pixels), 
placed in rows and columns (the raster). Digital photos, scanned images, and just 
about anything that you put on a layer in Photoshop consists of pixels. When you 
edit the image, you’re changing the color of the individual pixels, sometimes in 
subtle ways and sometimes in dramatic ways.
Vector artwork is a horse of another color. Rather than pixels, vector art consists of 
a mathematically defined path to which you add color. In Photoshop, as in Adobe 
Illustrator, the path produces the shape of the object, and you can add color both 
along the path (stroke) and within the path (fill) to make the shape become an 
object.
Figure  11-1 shows a fine example of 
vector artwork. Observe that each ele-
ment in the image consists of a sin-
gle color. Each section of the image 
is easily identifiable as an individual 
object, consisting of a specific color. 
(Remember, 
though, 
that 
vector 
objects can be filled with gradients 
rather than color.)
Each element in the artwork is defined 
by its path, which consists of a num-
ber of path segments. In Figure 11-2,  
you see the path that defines the 
tongue. (You read about the anatomy 
of a path later in this chapter, in the 
section “Understanding paths.”)
When artwork is defined by pixels, 
the little square corners of the indi-
vidual pixels can be noticeable along 
curves and diagonal lines. With vec-
tor artwork, the path is sharp and the edges are well defined. However, to truly 
get the best appearance from vector art or vector type, the artwork must be 
printed to a PostScript-capable device, such as a laser printer. PostScript is a page-­
description language that takes advantage of the mathematical descriptions of 
vector art. When you print to an inkjet printer, the vector art is converted to pix-
els. If you print to such a non-PostScript device, use a high image resolution for 
FIGURE 11-1: 
Each element in vector art has a single specific 
color.

CHAPTER 11  Precision Edges with Vector Paths     223
best output — 300 pixels per inch (ppi) is usually 
good. If you know you’ll be outputting to a non-­
PostScript device, before you start creating shapes, 
go to Photoshop’s Preferences ➪ Tools and make 
sure to select Snap Vector Tools and Transforma-
tion to Pixel Grid.
A vector path can be scaled (changed in size) almost 
infinitely without losing its appearance. A vec-
tor logo can be used for both a business card and 
a billboard without loss of quality because the path 
is mathematically scaled before the stroke or fill is 
added. Raster art, on the other hand, can be severely 
degraded by such scaling. For a simple demonstra-
tion of the difference between scaling rasterized text 
and scaling Photoshop’s vector type, see Figure 11-3.
Easy Vectors: Using Shapes
If you made it through the preceding section, you’re officially an expert on the 
theory of vector graphics. It’s time to see how you can actually create these little 
devils in your artwork. The easiest way to create a shape in Photoshop is with 
the aptly named shape tools, which automatically create a vector shape that you 
can stroke with a solid, dashed, or dotted line, and fill with color, a gradient, or a 
pattern. Could you have it any easier? Just drag a tool and create a vector-based 
object!
Your basic shape tools
Rectangles, rectangles with rounded corners (rounded rectangles), circles and 
ovals, multisided polygons, straight lines and arrows, and a whole boatload of 
special custom shapes are all at your command with a simple click-drag. Select 
the appropriate tool in the Toolbox, select the desired options on the Options bar, 
and click-drag to create your object. (The various shape tools are nested in the 
FIGURE 11-2: 
Paths define the outline of an 
object — the snake’s tongue, in 
this case.

when scaling.

224     PART 3  Creating “Art” in Photoshop
Toolbox, as shown in Figure 11-4.) Sounds simple, right? It is — no tricks. Here 
are some additional features to make things even easier for you:
»
» Use the Shift key. Pressing the Shift key 
(both Mac and Windows) while you drag 
constrains proportions (maintains the 
width-to-height ratio). With the Shift key, 
the Rectangle tool creates squares; the 
Ellipse tool creates circles; the Polygon 
tool creates proportional polygons; the 
Line tool creates horizontal or vertical 
lines (or lines at 45° angles). When using 
custom shapes, pressing the Shift key 
ensures that the shape retains the 
width-to-height ratio with which it was 
originally defined.
»
» Use the Option (Mac) or Alt (Windows) 
key. The Option/Alt key creates the 
object centered on the point at which 
you click. Without the Option/Alt key, the 
object is created in whichever direction 
you drag.
»
» Use the Shift and Option/Alt key. Pressing Shift and Option/Alt together creates 
a proportionally constrained object, centered on the point at which you click.
»
» Click the shape tool. If you click rather than drag, you’ll open a small dialog 
box that allows you to enter precise dimensions for your new shape. Click OK 
and the shape is created to the lower right of (or centered on) the point where 
you clicked. The dialog box for the Rectangle tool is visible in Figure 11-4.
»
» Use the spacebar. While you’re dragging a shape, keep the mouse button 
down and press the spacebar. You can then drag to reposition the object 
while you create it. Still keeping the mouse button down, release the spacebar 
and finish dragging the object.
»
» Check the Options bar. When you switch from shape tool to shape tool, the 
Options bar changes to fit your needs. For example, with the Rounded 
Rectangle tool active, you choose the radius of the rounded corners. The 
Polygon tool offers a simple field in which you choose the number of sides for 
the shape. When you’re using the Line tool, choose the thickness (weight) of 
the line on the Options bar. Click the Gear button to the left of the Weight field 
on the Options bar to add arrowheads to the lines.
»
» Change the layer content. With a shape layer selected in the Layers panel, 
select any shape tool and change the shape’s attributes on the Options bar. 
You can easily change (or remove) both the fill and the stroke.
FIGURE 11-4: 
The shape tools are collected in one spot 
in Photoshop’s Toolbox.

CHAPTER 11  Precision Edges with Vector Paths     225
»
» Edit the vector path. As you can see later in this chapter (in the section 
“Adding, deleting, and moving anchor points”), you can use the Direct 
Selection tool to change the course of the path, customizing the appearance 
of the shape.
»
» Create work paths or pixel-filled shapes. Using the three options in the 
menu to the left on the Options bar, you can elect to create shapes, work paths 
(temporary paths used to make selections or masks), or add pixels in the 
selected shape to your currently active layer.
You can easily spot a shape layer in the Layers panel  — especially when the 
default layer name starts with the word Shape. (You can, of course, change the 
layer name by double-clicking it in the Layers panel.) You can see in the Layers 
panel shown in Figure  11-5 that the shape layer thumbnail includes the shape 
badge in the lower-right corner. When a shape layer is selected in the Layers 
panel, that shape’s path is visible in the Paths panel.
The Custom Shape tool
Although the basic shape tools are great for circles and squares and lines and 
arrows, you’ll probably get the most use out of the Custom Shape tool. With this 
tool selected, you click the triangle to the right of the sample shape on the Options 
bar to open the Custom Shape picker, as shown in Figure 11-6. The Custom Shape 
picker offers a number of ready-to-use shapes. When you click the triangle in the 
upper-right corner, you can choose from a variety of other sets of shapes listed at 
the bottom of the Custom Shape picker menu. Also on the Options bar, click the 
Fill field and the Stroke field to open their options, and the More Options button 
enables you to customize the stroke.
FIGURE 11-5: 
Dragging a 
shape tool 
creates both 
a shape layer 
and the path 
that defines 
the shape.

226     PART 3  Creating “Art” in Photoshop
When you select a set of custom shapes from the menu (or use the Load Shapes 
command to add a set of shapes not in the menu), you are asked whether you 
want to add the new shapes to the current content of the Custom Shape picker 
(Append), replace the current shapes (OK), or not add the shapes after all (Cancel). 
When you select All from the Custom Shape picker menu and click OK, you’ll load 
over 300 custom shapes, ranging from signs and symbols to animals and cartoon 
talk balloons.
Note to the far right of the Options bar the check box for Align Edges. Using that 
option ensures that the edges of your vector shapes align to the pixel grid and print 
more precisely when using a non-PostScript printer (such as an inkjet printer).
More custom shapes — free!
The custom shapes already available in Photoshop cover a wide range, but they 
might not fill all your needs. You can purchase commercial collections of cus-
tom shapes from a couple of sources. You can create custom paths and define 
shapes from them, too. But you’ve already got bunches of custom shapes on your 
computer, just waiting for you to use them. Select Photoshop’s Type tool and 
take a look in your Font menu. Check out the fonts already there with names like 
Wingdings, Webdings, Symbol, and MT Extra. (Your font list may vary.) These are all 
examples of symbol fonts, which are fonts that have shapes and symbols rather 
than letters and numbers. Many more typical fonts also have special characters 
available when you use the Shift key, the Option/Alt key, and the Shift key in com-
bination with the Option/Alt key.
Here’s how you can define a custom shape from a symbol:
1.	 Choose File ➪ New to open a new document.
The document can be virtually any size and can be either grayscale or color.
FIGURE 11-6: 
The Fill and 
Stroke options 
are available 
for all shape-
creation tools.

CHAPTER 11  Precision Edges with Vector Paths     227
2.	 Select the Type tool and pick a font.
With the Type tool active, choose a symbol font from either the Options bar or 
the Character panel. The font size doesn’t matter much because you’re 
creating a vector-based shape that you can easily scale. The foreground color 
doesn’t matter either because shape tools rely on the foreground color active 
at the time you create the shape.
3.	 Type a single symbol and then end the editing session.
Click the check mark button to the right on the Options bar, switch tools in the 
Toolbox, or press ⌘  +Return (Mac) or Ctrl+Enter (Windows) to end the editing 
session. (The symbol visible in Figure 11-7 can be produced by pressing the V 
key when using the Webdings font.)
4.	 Convert the type character to a shape layer.
With the type layer active in the Layers panel, choose Type ➪ Convert to Shape.
5.	 Define a custom shape.
Choose Edit ➪ Define Custom Shape, give your new shape a name in the Shape 
Name dialog box (shown in Figure 11-7), and save it. Your new shape is added 
to the Custom Shape picker, ready to use.
Later in this chapter, after you master using the Pen tool, remember this section. 
You can also define a custom shape from paths that you create with the Pen tool — 
any shape at all!
Remember that your custom shapes aren’t truly saved until you use the Custom 
Shape picker menu command Save Shapes (to save all the shapes in the picker as 
a single set) or the Edit ➪ Presets ➪ Preset Manager command (to save a set of 
selected shapes). In the Preset Manager dialog box, ⌘  +click/Ctrl+click each custom 
shape and then click the Save Set button to save them as a set. (See Figure 11-8.)  
Until you take this step, the shapes exist only in Photoshop’s Preferences file. If 
the Preferences become corrupt, you could lose all your custom shapes. This holds 
FIGURE 11-7: 
Name your 
new shape and 
click OK.

228     PART 3  Creating “Art” in Photoshop
true, too, for custom brushes, layer styles, swatches, and the like — use the Preset 
Manager to save all your custom items.
When saving custom shapes (or layer styles or brushes or any of your other cus-
tom bits and pieces) with the Preset Manager, save them in a folder outside the 
Photoshop folder. That prevents accidental loss should you ever need to (gasp!) 
reinstall Photoshop. Figure 11-8 shows one possible folder structure for saving 
and organizing your custom bits and pieces.
When you installed Photoshop, you were offered the option of migrating pre-
sets from earlier versions of the program. If you did not do so then, you can 
add those older presets to Photoshop’s new Presets folders by choosing Edit ➪  
Presets ➪ Migrate Presets.
Changing the appearance  
of the shape layer
After you use any one of the numerous shape tools in the Photoshop arsenal to add 
a shape layer to your artwork, you have a number of ways that you can enhance, 
adjust, and simply change its appearance:
»
» Add a layer style. Layer styles, such as bevels, glows, and shadows (applied 
through the Layer ➪ Layer Style menu), can certainly spice up a shape layer. 
Compare, for example, the pair of shapes in Figure 11-9. (Layer styles are 
presented in Chapter 12.) By working with blending modes and opacity, you 
can combine a Gradient Overlay or a Pattern Overlay effect with a shape’s 
gradient or pattern (or color) fill.
FIGURE 11-8: 
Use the Preset 
Manager to 
save sets of 
your custom 
shapes.

CHAPTER 11  Precision Edges with Vector Paths     229
»
» Change the layer content. As 
with any shape, you can use a 
shape tool’s Options bar to make 
changes to fill, stroke, and other 
custom shape attributes.
»
» Edit the path shape. Click a path 
with the Direct Selection tool and 
drag to change the path’s shape. 
(This is discussed in more detail 
later in this chapter.)
»
» Change the layer blending mode or opacity. By default, your shape layer’s 
blending mode is Normal, and the Opacity is set to 100%. Your shape layer 
blocks and hides the content of every layer below. By changing the blending 
mode or opacity, you can make your shape layer interact with the layers 
below in interesting ways. Experiment with different blending modes to find 
one that suits your artistic vision. (Blending modes are covered in more detail 
in Chapter 10.)
Simulating a multicolor shape layer
Shapes can be filled with a single solid color, a gradient, or a pattern. Sometimes, 
however, you’re better served with a multicolor shape. Take a look at Figure 11-10 
and compare the pair of shapes to the left with the same shapes to the right.
In addition to the layer styles applied, layer masks hide parts of the more elaborate 
pair of shapes on the right. A layer mask determines what areas of the layer are 
visible. You can use layer masks with shapes, as you can see for three of the four 
layers in Figure 11-11.
FIGURE 11-9: 
A simple layer style makes your shape jump off 
the page.
FIGURE 11-10: 
Dressing up 
the shapes can 
make a world 
of difference.

230     PART 3  Creating “Art” in Photoshop
Comparing the shapes’ color in the left thumbnail in the Layers panel to the art-
work helps you identify what you see in Figure 11-11:
»
» Shape 1 copy: This is the top layer and would normally hide everything on the 
layers below. The shape, as you can tell from the left thumbnail in the Layers 
panel, is green. The thumbnail to the right is the layer mask. By painting with 
black in the layer mask, you can hide parts of the layer. In this case, only the 
left part of the shape is visible.
»
» Shape 2 copy: You can see that the shape is an entire pair of gray scissors. 
The thumbnail to the right shows that most of the layer is hidden by a layer 
mask, leaving only the blades of the scissors shape visible.
»
» Shape 2: This layer requires no layer mask for the artwork. The shape layer 
just above hides what would be black scissors blades.
»
» Shape 1: The layers above partially hide the red shape layer. Notice how, 
because of the order of the layers in the Layers panel, the blades of the 
scissors appear to be in front of the red part of the object and behind the 
green part of the object.
Adding a layer mask to your shape is as easy as clicking the Add Layer Mask button 
at the bottom of the Layers panel (third button from the left) and then painting 
with black to hide, white to show, and gray to partially hide. You can also make 
a selection in your image and use the Layer ➪ Layer Mask menu commands. You 
can add layer masks to any layer except those named Background. (You can’t have 
transparent areas on a background layer, but you can convert it to a regular layer 
by clicking the Lock icon to the right of the layer name in the Layers panel.)
FIGURE 11-11: 
Layer masks

layer visibility.

CHAPTER 11  Precision Edges with Vector Paths     231
Using Your Pen Tool to Create Paths
Even with all the custom shapes available, you might need to create a path that’s 
unique to a specific image. For that, Photoshop offers the Pen tool and its associ-
ated tools. Before you start creating paths willy-nilly, you can probably benefit 
from a little bit of background information about paths.
Understanding paths
As you click and click-drag, you place anchor points, which connect the path seg-
ments that create your path. Path segments can be straight or curved. You con-
trol those curves not with diet and exercise but rather with direction lines and 
control points. A straight path seg-
ment is bordered on either end by 
corner anchor points, and a curved path 
segment is bordered by two smooth 
anchor points or one of each type. As 
shown in ­Figure  11-12, Photoshop 
helps you differentiate between path 
segments and direction lines by using 
squares (hollow and filled) for anchor 
points and diamond shapes for con-
trol points.
Only smooth anchor points have 
direction lines and control points. The angle and length of the direction line deter-
mine the shape of the curve. When you create a curved path segment between a 
corner anchor point and a smooth anchor point, only the smooth point’s direc-
tion lines adjust the curve. When you create a curved path segment between two 
smooth anchor points, both points’ direction lines affect the curve.
Here’s another important way to classify paths in Photoshop:
»
» An open path has two distinct and visible endpoints; think of it as a pencil line 
or piece of string.
»
» A closed path has no beginning or end — like a circle or an unbroken rubber 
band.
When you use a shape tool, you’re creating closed paths. When you click-click- 
click with the Pen tool, you create an open path — unless, that is, your final click 
is back on the very first anchor point.
FIGURE 11-12: 
Paths have square anchor points and diamond-
shaped control points.

232     PART 3  Creating “Art” in Photoshop
At long last (and many years of begging and pleading), you can now change the 
thickness and color of a path! Simply click the Gear button on a pen tool’s Options 
bar and set the color and thickness you desire to make your path more visible.
Clicking and dragging your way  
down the path of knowledge
All that theory about how paths work is fine, but you’ll get a better understanding 
by playing around with the Pen tool. Open a new document (any size, resolution, 
and color mode will do) and select the Pen tool. On the Options bar, click the menu 
to the left (as shown in Figure 11-13) and select Path so that the tool creates work 
paths rather than shapes, and then start clicking around. Randomly click in vari-
ous places in the image, adding new straight path segments as you go.
The third option in the menu, Pixels, is used only with Shape tools.
I’m sure Picasso would be proud, but it’s time to let go of your new artwork and 
move on  — press Delete (Mac) or Backspace (Windows) twice. The first time 
deletes the most recent anchor point; the second time deletes the rest of the path.
Now, in that same canvas, start click-dragging to create curved path segments. 
Watch how the distance and direction in which you drag control the segment’s 
curve. Just because it’s fun, try a click-drag and, with the mouse button held 
down, move the mouse around and around in a circle. “Path Jump Rope!” Press 
Delete/Backspace twice to delete the path.
Now, to get a feel for how to control your curved path segments, follow these 
steps:
1.	 Choose File ➪ New to open a new document.
2.	 Click Web at the top of the panel, choose 1024x768, and click Create.
A reasonable size to work with, it fits on your screen at 100% zoom.

bar to deter-

CHAPTER 11  Precision Edges with Vector Paths     233
3.	 Show the Grid.
Press ⌘  +’ (apostrophe; Mac) or Ctrl+ ’ (apostrophe; Windows) to show the Grid 
in the image. The Grid makes it easier to control the Pen tool as you drag. You 
can also show the Grid by choosing View ➪ Show ➪ Grid. In Photoshop’s 
Preferences ➪ Guides, Grid & Slices, the Grid shown in Figure 11-14 is set to 
Gridline every: 1 inch and Subdivisions: 6.
4.	 Select the Pen tool in the Toolbox.
5.	 Click and click-drag as shown in Figure 11-14.
Don’t worry about precision — you won’t be creating a work of art this time. 
Click the dots in numeric order; where you see a dashed line, click-drag in that 
direction for approximately that distance.
You’ve just created four of the more useful scallops and curve sets! These sorts 
of paths can be used in a variety of ways, including stroking, filling, and creating 
selections (all of which I discuss later in this chapter) to create decorative borders 
and artistic elements in your images.
You should know about a couple of other features of the Pen tools before you move 
on. With the Freeform Pen tool active, take a look at the Options bar (or look at 
Figure 11-15, which shows the Options bar).
FIGURE 11-14: 
You don’t need 
to be precise; 
just more or 
less follow the 
four patterns.

234     PART 3  Creating “Art” in Photoshop
With a path active in the Paths panel, the Pen tool’s Options bar enables you to 
load the path as a selection and create a layer mask. (A Background layer is auto-
matically converted to a layer that supports transparency.) You can also create 
a shape from the path. Note, too, that when the Freeform Pen tool is active, the 
Options bar offers a Magnetic option — more on that option in a bit.
When you have the Freeform Pen tool selected in the Toolbox you can click and 
drag around your image, creating a path as you go. It’s much like painting with the 
Brush tool or drawing lines with the Pencil tool — wherever you drag the tool, the 
path is created. When you need to make a path (or selection) around the outside 
of something of uniform color in your image, using the Magnetic option forces 
the path to look for and follow edges. Take a look at Figure 11-16, which shows 
an example of an appropriate use for the Freeform Pen and the Magnetic option.
Photoshop has another pen tool, one you may never need. The new Curvature Pen 
tool functions much like the Pen tool with which you’re already familiar. There 
are a couple of differences. By default, the Curvature Pen tool assumes you want 
to create a curved path segment, so you click, move the cursor, click, move the 
mouse, and click a third time, and a curved path appears through the three anchor

points. If you need a corner anchor point, double-click or Option/Alt+click. Press 
the Escape key to finish a path. You can click and drag an anchor point to move it 
(no need for ⌘  /Control as you would with the Pen tool).
A closer look at the Paths panel
You can save, duplicate, convert, stroke, and delete paths via the Paths panel 
(which, like all panels, you can show and hide through the Window menu). You 
can even create a path from a selection by using the Paths panel. Without the 
Paths panel, your paths have no meaning or future and probably won’t get into a 
good university or even a good collage (pun intended).
Pick a path, any path
The Paths panel can hold as many paths as you could possibly want to add to your 
artwork. You can also see the seven buttons across the bottom of the panel that 
you use to quickly and easily work with your paths. You can classify paths in five 
different ways, as shown in Figure 11-17.
FIGURE 11-17: 
The Paths 
panel is 
your key to 
organizing and 
controlling 
vectors in your 
artwork.

236     PART 3  Creating “Art” in Photoshop
You might not use them all, but it’s good to know the five types of paths:
»
» Unsaved Path: As you create a path, Photoshop generates a temporary work 
path. You can have multiple paths in a single work path. They are even 
preserved when you save and close your artwork. However, it’s usually best to 
double-click the Work Path name and give your path a meaningful name.
»
» Clipping Path: Clipping paths are used primarily with some page layout 
programs, such as QuarkXPress. Much like how a vector path determines 
what parts of the layer are visible, a clipping path identifies what part of the 
image as a whole is visible. You won’t need a clipping path when you work 
with Adobe InDesign — simply create your artwork on a transparent back-
ground and place that Photoshop file into an InDesign document. To create a 
clipping path, first make your path, give it a name in the Paths panel, and then 
use the Paths panel menu command Clipping Path.
»
» Saved Path: Much like working in the Layers panel, you can double-click the 
name of any path and rename it in the Paths panel.
»
» Shape Path: When a shape is active in the Layers panel, its path is visible in 
the Paths panel. If you want to customize a shape’s path, you need to make 
the layer active first. When a shape path is visible, you can drag it to the New 
Path button at the bottom of the panel to create a duplicate. (It’s the second 
button from the right.)
»
» Layer Vector Mask: When a regular layer has a vector mask assigned and 
that layer is visible in the Layers panel, the layer’s mask path is visible in the 
Paths panel.
When creating a clipping path, leave the Flatness field completely empty unless 
your print shop specifically instructs you to use a specific value. The Flatness 
value overrides the output device’s native setting for reproducing curves. Using 
the wrong value can lead to disastrous (and expensive!) mistakes.
To activate a path in the Paths panel, click it. You can then see and edit the path 
in the image window. With the exception of shape layer and vector mask paths, 
the paths in the Paths panel are independent of any layer. You could create a path 
with the Background layer active and then later use that path as the basis for some 
artwork on, for example, Layer 3.
You can Shift+click (or ⌘  +click/Control+click) multiple paths to select more 
than one. You might then use the Path Selection tool to move all of the paths at 
the same time or perhaps scale them uniformly by choosing Edit ➪ Transform 
Path ➪ Scale.

CHAPTER 11  Precision Edges with Vector Paths     237
The Paths panel buttons
The seven buttons across the bottom of the Paths panel (refer to Figure 11-17) do 
more than just simple panel housekeeping. Use them to create artwork from a 
path and to convert back and forth between paths and selections.
»
» Fill Path: Click a path in the Paths panel and then use this button to fill the 
area inside the path on the active layer with the foreground color. If you fill an 
open path (a path with two distinct endpoints), Photoshop pretends that 
there’s a straight path segment between the endpoints. If a shape layer or a 
type layer is selected in the Layers panel, the Fill Path button isn’t available. 
You can see filled (and stroked) paths in Figure 11-18.
»
» Stroke Path: Click a path in the Paths panel and then click this button to add 
a band of the foreground color along the course of the path. Most often, you 
can think of it as painting the path itself with the Brush tool. If you have a 
different brush-using tool active in the Toolbox (Clone Stamp, Healing Brush, 
Dodge, Burn, Eraser, and so on), the path is stroked with that tool. Like a fill, a 
stroke is added to the currently active layer in the Layers panel. (Strokes are 
added to shapes on the Options bar.) Take a look at Figure 11-18 to see how 
stroking and filling can be used in combination with each other.
»
» Selection from Path: When you have a path selected in the Paths panel, you 
click this button, and voilà! An instant — and very precise — selection is at 
your disposal. You can create a selection from any path. If you want to add 
feathering while making the selection, use the Paths panel menu command 
Make Selection rather than clicking the Selection from Path button.
FIGURE 11-18: 
Think about 
whether you 
want to stroke 
first (left) or fill 
first (right).

238     PART 3  Creating “Art” in Photoshop
»
» Path from Selection: You can create a work path from any selection simply 
by clicking this button. If the path isn’t as accurate as you’d like, or if it’s too 
complex because it’s trying to follow the corner of every pixel, use the Paths 
panel menu command Make Work Path and adjust the Tolerance setting to 
suit your needs.
»
» Vector Mask from Path: If the layer active in the Layers panel supports 
transparency and you have a saved or work path selected, you can add a 
vector layer mask to the layer.
»
» New Path: You’ll likely use this button primarily to duplicate an existing path. 
Drag any path to the button, and a copy is instantly available in the Paths 
panel. When you click this button, you’re not creating (or replacing) a work 
path but rather starting a new saved path.
»
» Delete Path: In the Paths panel, drag a path to the Delete Path button or click 
the path and then click the button. Either way, the path is eliminated from the 
panel and from your artwork.
The order in which you stroke and fill a path can make a huge difference in the 
appearance of your artwork. The stroke is centered on the path, half inside and 
half outside. The fill extends throughout the interior of the path. If you stroke a 
path and then add a fill, the fill covers that part of your stroke that’s inside the 
path. As you can see in Figure 11-18, that’s not always a bad thing.
Rather than using the buttons at the bottom of the Paths panel to fill and stroke, 
you can also use the Paths panel menu commands Fill Path and Stroke Path. The 
commands open dialog boxes that offer more options than simply using the cur-
rent foreground color. When using the Stroke Path command, you can choose from 
any of the brush-using tools, which enables you to, for example, very precisely 
dodge, burn, or clone along a path you create. When using Fill Path, you can add 
color or a pattern within the path, or fill to a designated state in the History panel.
Sometimes the easiest and fastest way to create a complex path is to make a selec-
tion and convert the selection to a path. You might, for example, click once with 
the Magic Wand and then click the Path from Selection button at the bottom of 
the Paths panel.
When using the Shape tools to create shapes (rather than paths), you should use 
the Fill and Stroke features on the Options bar. If you later edit the shape, the fill 
and stroke conform to the shape’s new path. Using the Fill and Stroke options 
in the Paths panel with paths (rather than shapes) results in pixels added to the 
active layer. If you later change the path shape, the fill and stroke don’t change 
with the new path shape.

CHAPTER 11  Precision Edges with Vector Paths     239
Customizing Any Path
Photoshop gives you a lot of control over your paths, not just when creating them, 
but afterward as well. After a path is created, you can edit the path itself. While 
the path is active in the Paths panel, the Edit ➪ Transform Path commands are 
available, giving you control over size, rotation, perspective, skewing, and even 
distortion. But there’s also much finer control at your fingertips. You can adjust 
anchor points, change curved path segments, add or delete anchor points, and 
even combine multiple paths into compound paths, in which one path cuts a hole 
in another. (Think donut.)
Adding, deleting, and moving anchor points
Photoshop provides you with a number of tools with which to edit paths, although 
you might never use a couple of them. Consider, for example, the Add Anchor Point 
and Delete Anchor Point tools shown in Figure 11-15. Now take a look at the Option 
bar’s Auto Add/Delete option. With the Pen tool active, you automatically switch to 
the Delete Anchor Point tool when over an anchor point, and automatically switch 
to the Add Anchor Point tool when the cursor is over a path segment. Smart tool, 
eh? The Convert Point tool, on the other hand, can be invaluable . . . or valuable, at 
least. Click a smooth anchor point to convert it to a corner anchor point. You can 
also click-drag a corner anchor point to convert it to a smooth point.
Nested in the Toolbox with the Path Selection tool (which you use to select and 
drag a path in its entirety), the Direct Selection tool lets you alter individual path 
segments, individual anchor points, and even the individual direction lines that 
control curved path segments. (When you click a shape with the Direct Selection 
tool, the Options bar can also be used to change the shape’s attributes, including 
fill, stroke, and size.)
When you click an anchor point with the Direct Selection tool, you can drag it into a 
new position, altering the shape of the path. If it’s a smooth anchor point, clicking 
it with the Direct Selection tool makes the point’s direction lines visible (as well 
as those of immediately neighboring smooth anchor points). When manipulating 
paths, the Direct Selection tool follows a few simple rules of behavior (which you 
can see illustrated by pairs of “before” and “after” paths in Figure 11-19):
»
» Drag a path segment. Drag a path segment with two corner anchor points, 
and you drag those points along with you. If the path segment has one or two 
smooth points, you drag the segment (reshaping the curve), but the anchor 
points remain firmly in place. Note in Figure 11-19 (upper left) that when you 
drag a curved path segment, the adjoining direction lines change length, but 
they retain their original angles.

240     PART 3  Creating “Art” in Photoshop
»
» Drag a corner anchor point. Click a corner anchor point and drag, and the 
Direct Selection tool pulls the two adjoining path segments along with it. As 
you can see in Figure 11-19 (upper center), the other two anchor points (and 
the path segment between them) are unchanged.
»
» Drag a smooth anchor point. When you drag a smooth anchor point, all four 
of the direction lines associated with the path segments on either side retain 
both their lengths and their angles. The direction lines don’t change; only the 
curved path segments connected at the smooth anchor point are altered. In 
Figure 11-19 (upper right), the path continues to flow smoothly through the 
anchor point, even as the point moves.
»
» Drag a smooth point’s direction line. Dragging a direction line changes the 
curves on either side of the anchor point so that the path still flows smoothly 
through the point. (Remember that you click the control point at the end of a 
direction line to drag it.) Figure 11-19 (lower left) illustrates how the path 
segments on either side of the smooth point adjust as the direction line is 
changed. However, paths don’t always flow smoothly through a smooth 
anchor point — not if you use the following trick!
»
» Option+drag/Alt+drag a direction line. Hold down the Option/Alt key and 
drag a smooth anchor point’s direction line, and you’ll break the flow of the 
path through that point. With the Option/Alt key, you change only the path 
segment on that side of the anchor point, leaving the adjoining path segment 
unchanged. In Figure 11-19 to the lower left, the direction line on the left is 
being dragged without the Option/Alt key (as described in the preceding bullet 
point). To the lower right, adding the modifier key preserves the appearance 
of the adjoining path segment.

paths are

CHAPTER 11  Precision Edges with Vector Paths     241
You can hold down the Shift key with the Direct Selection tool to ensure that 
you’re dragging in a straight line. You can also hold down the Shift key to select 
multiple anchor points before you drag.
Combining paths
As you’ve probably noticed through 
the course of this chapter, some paths 
are very simple (like the paths in the 
preceding figure) and some paths are 
more complex (like the shapes shown 
earlier in Figure 11-11). Complex paths 
are often compound paths: that is, 
paths that contain two or more paths 
(called subpaths) that interact with 
each other. Think about a pair of cir-
cles, different sizes, centered on top of 
each other. What if the smaller circle 
cut a hole in the middle of the larger 
circle, creating a wheel (or, depend-
ing on how early you’re reading this, 
a bagel)? Take a look at Figure 11-20.
Two (or more) paths can interact in 
several ways. Complete this sentence 
with terms from the following list: “The second path can (fill in the blank) the origi-
nal path.”
»
» Combine Shapes with: The areas within the two subpaths are combined as if 
they were within a single path (although they remain two subpaths).
»
» Subtract Front Shape from: The second path is used like a cookie cutter to 
delete an area from within the first path. (When you need to make a bagel, 
this is the option!)
»
» Intersect Shape Areas with: Only the area where the two subpaths overlap 
is retained.
»
» Exclude Overlapping Shapes from: All the area within both subpaths is 
retained except where the two paths overlap.
When any shape tool, the Pen tool, the Path Selection tool, or Direct Selection 
tool is active, the Options bar presents you with four options to determine the 
behavior of multiple paths. (The first path that you create is always a normal path. 
The options don’t come into play until you add additional subpaths.) Figure 11-21 
FIGURE 11-20: 
Two (or more) paths can interact with each 
other, creating a compound path, consisting of 
two or more subpaths.

shows each option name and provides a simple graphic representation to dem-
onstrate the interaction. The upper-left path is the original, with the lower-right 
path showing how each option controls the interaction between subpaths.
As you can see in Figure 11-21, when a tool is set to create a shape, the New Layer 
option is available. Using the Merge Shape Components option merges overlap-
ping paths, creating a single path rather than a compound path. (In Figure 11-21, 
compare the black line to the right of Merge Shape Components to the pair of 
black lines to the right of Combine Shapes.)
Tweaking type for a custom font
I want to show you one more little thing you can do with vectors in Photoshop — a 
last bit of fun before this chapter ends. Each individual character in a font consists 
of paths. You can convert the type to shape layers (or work paths) and change 
the appearance of the individual characters by editing their paths with the Direct 
Selection tool. Follow these steps:
1.	 Open a new document in Photoshop.
2.	 Create a new document measuring 800x600 pixels.
3.	 Select the Horizontal Type tool in the Toolbox and set the font.
From the Options bar, choose Arial, set the font style to Bold, set the font size 
to 72, choose Sharp for anti-aliasing, left-align, and click near the lower left of 
your document.
Okay, in all honesty, you can use just about any settings you want — but if you 
use these settings, your image will look a lot like mine.

second path  
(and any 
subsequent 
paths) interacts

original path.

4.	 Type the word Billiards in your image.
5.	 Press ⌘  +Return/Ctrl+Enter to end the text editing session.
6.	 Choose Type ➪ Convert to Shape.
This changes the type layer (editable text on its own layer) to a shape.
7.	 Activate the Direct Selection tool.
8.	 Edit the shapes of the Ls and the D to simulate billiard cues.
Drag the uppermost anchor points even farther upward to create cue sticks.
See the result in Figure 11-22.

CHAPTER 12  Dressing Up Images with Layer Styles     245
Dressing Up Images 
with Layer Styles
I
n artwork and photography, you use shadows and highlights in your image to 
produce the illusion of depth. Highlights and shadows lead the viewer to imag-
ine that a light is falling on parts of a 3D object. You can also use a shadow or 
glow to make it appear that some distance exists between one object in the image 
and another object behind it. Photoshop’s built-in layer styles help you add shad-
ows, glows, and other effects almost instantly.
In this chapter, I explain how transparent areas on layers enable lower layers to 
show through and let your layer styles appear on those lower layers. You get a 
good look at the Styles panel and how you use it to store and apply layer styles, 
including your very own custom styles. I then present the all-important (for layer 
styles) Layer Style dialog box and the various effects that you can add with it. I 
also show you how to save (and protect) your custom layer styles.
What Are Layer Styles?
A layer style comprises one or more effects that surround or are applied to all the 
pixels on your layer. Effects that surround pixels include strokes (thin or thick 
outlines of color), shadows (just like the one you’re casting right now), and glows

(outlines of semitransparent color). Effects that are applied to pixels include over-
lays of color, patterns, or even gradients. But Photoshop offers even more, includ-
ing the ever-popular Bevel and Emboss effect, which does a great job of giving the 
content of your layer a 3D look. And, of course, effects can be used in combination; 
check out Figure 12-1 for an example. You can add effects to layers in several ways, 
including through the Layer Style menu at the bottom of the Layers panel, as 
shown in Figure 12-2. I explain each of the effects individually later in this chapter 
in the section on creating your own custom layer styles.
Just so everyone is on the same sheet of music, when you refer to a drop shadow or 
an outer glow or a color overlay or any one of the other items shown in the menu 
in Figure 12-2, call it a layer effect or simply an effect.
FIGURE 12-1: 
Strokes, 
shadows, and 
bevels are 
just some of 
the effects 
available.
FIGURE 12-2: 
You can add 
a layer style 
through the 
Layers panel.

CHAPTER 12  Dressing Up Images with Layer Styles     247
Some layer effects, such as drop shad-
ows and outer glows, appear outside 
the content of the layer. For those 
effects to be visible in your artwork, 
the layer must have at least some 
area of transparent pixels. If the layer 
is filled edge to edge, the effect has 
no place within the image to appear 
because the glow or shadow would 
logically be outside the image’s can-
vas. Take a look at a couple of layer 
style examples in Figure 12-3.
In the sample on the left, you can imagine that the shadow logically also appears 
to the lower right of the object as a whole (as it does in the sample to the right). 
However, that’s outside the image’s canvas, so that part of the shadow doesn’t 
appear in the artwork.
Keep in mind that every layer in an image has the same number of pixels — but 
some of those pixels can be transparent. When a layer has areas of transparency, 
layers below in the image can show through. In the two examples in Figure 12-3, 
the yellow background layer is visible, giving the upper layer’s shadows a place to 
fall. (And remember that a layer named Background can’t have areas of transpar-
ency. Convert it to a regular layer by clicking the Lock icon to the right of the layer 
name.) Chapter 10 is full of information on working with layers.
Using the Styles Panel
The Styles panel is hidden by default. Choose Window ➪ Styles to make it visible. 
This panel, which you see with its menu open in Figure 12-4, is where you find and 
store layer styles and is the easiest way to apply a layer style to your active layer.
To apply a layer style via the Styles panel, make the target layer active by clicking 
it in the Layers panel; then click the style that you want to apply. It’s truly that 
simple! To remove a layer style from the active layer, click the leftmost button at 
the bottom of the Styles panel. You can click the middle button to save a custom 
layer style (which I explain later in this chapter), and you can drag a layer style to 
the Trash icon on the right to delete it from the panel.
FIGURE 12-3: 
Some layer effects need transparent areas on 
the layer, or they won’t appear.

248     PART 3  Creating “Art” in Photoshop
Take a look at the Styles panel menu 
shown in Figure  12-4, starting from 
the top and making your way down to 
the bottom. The first command sim-
ply adds the style applied to the active 
layer to the panel (like clicking the 
Create New Style button).
In the second section of the menu, you 
can choose from five different ways to 
view the content of the Styles panel. 
The Text Only, Small List, and Large 
List options might come in handy 
after you create a bunch of custom 
styles with names you recognize, but 
until you become familiar with the 
styles in the panel, their names are 
pretty much meaningless. The Large 
Thumbnail option gives you a better 
view of the effects in the style, but 
you see fewer styles at a time in the 
panel than you can with the default 
Small Thumbnail view.
The Styles panel Preset Manager com-
mand opens the same Preset Manager 
that you access through the Edit ➪ Presets menu. Use the Preset Manager (dis-
cussed at the end of this chapter) to save custom styles in sets on your hard drive 
to protect them from accidental loss.
The next four commands in the Styles panel menu are what I call “housekeeping 
commands” because you use them to control the content of the panel:
»
» Reset Styles: The Reset Styles command returns the content of the panel to 
its default. You have the option of adding the default set to the current panel 
content with the Append button or replacing the current content with the 
selected set by clicking OK.
»
» Load Styles: Use the Load Styles command to add additional styles from your 
hard drive (or another location). You can download sets from various websites 
and even purchase prepared sets of layer styles on CD. The set is added to the 
current content of the panel automatically.
»
» Save Styles: The Save Styles command lets you save the current content of 
the panel as a set of styles. All the layer styles in the panel at the time are 
saved in the set.
FIGURE 12-4: 
The Styles panel holds your preset and saved 
layer styles.

CHAPTER 12  Dressing Up Images with Layer Styles     249
»
» Replace Styles: Use the Replace Styles command to remove the current 
content and then add the selected set.
Below in the Styles panel menu, you can find a list of all the layer style sets saved 
in Photoshop’s Presets ➪ Styles folder. When you select a set from that list, you 
have the option once again of appending or replacing the current content of the 
panel. (The list in your Styles panel menu might differ from what’s shown in 
Figure 12-4.)
The last two commands in the Styles panel menu are used to control the visibility 
of the panel (Close) and the visibility of the panel and those panels nested with it 
(Close Tab Group), which depends on how you’ve arranged Photoshop’s panels in 
your workspace.
Creating Custom Layer Styles
You create a custom layer style by applying one or more layer effects to your active 
layer. (Once again, remember that you can’t apply layer effects or layer styles 
to a layer named Background.) When 
you have the effects looking just the 
way you want them, you can add that 
new style to the Styles panel and 
even save it for sharing with friends 
and colleagues. Combining multiple 
layer effects lets you create complex 
and beautiful layer styles that change 
simple shapes and text into art.
Exploring the Layer 
Style menu
In addition to the pop-up menu at 
the bottom of the Layers panel (refer 
to Figure  12-2), you can apply layer 
effects through the Layer ➪ Layer 
Style menu. As you can see in 
Figure 12-5, the Layer Style menu has 
a few more commands than the menu 
at the bottom of the Layers panel.
FIGURE 12-5: 
You can use the Layer Style menu to apply layer 
effects and more.

250     PART 3  Creating “Art” in Photoshop
The ten items on the Layer Style menu below Blending Options are the actual layer 
effects. A check mark to the left of the effect indicates that it’s currently applied 
to the active layer. The Copy Layer Style and Paste Layer Style commands come in 
handy, but if you’re more mouse- or stylus-oriented than menu-oriented, you’ll 
find it easier to add the style to the Styles panel and click the style to apply it to 
other layers. You can also Option/Alt+drag a layer style from layer to layer in the 
Layers panel to duplicate it. Clear Layer Style is the equivalent of using the left-
most button at the bottom of the Styles panel — it removes all layer effects from 
the target layer. The four commands at the bottom of the menu are worthy of a 
little special attention:
»
» Global Light: A number of layer effects are applied at an angle. Drop shad-
ows, for example, simulate light coming from a specific angle (which, of 
course, determines where in your artwork that shadow falls). You use the 
Global Light command to set the default angle at which your effects are 
applied. Generally speaking, you want the angle to be consistent from effect 
to effect and from layer to layer in your artwork. There are exceptions, 
however, such as the situation shown in Figure 12-6. In that artwork, the two 
type layers have shadows receding at different angles to simulate a light 
source positioned immediately in front of and close to the image. (As you can 
read in the next section of this chapter, when you use layer effects that are 
applied at an angle, you have the option of using or not using the angle in 
Global Light.)
»
» Create Layers: Sometimes you need to edit a layer effect — say, to control 
where a drop shadow falls on the lower layers in the image. The Create Layers 
command rasterizes each layer effect (adds it to the image as a separate layer 
FIGURE 12-6: 
Sometimes 
shadows in 
your artwork 
shouldn’t all 
use the Global 
Light setting.

CHAPTER 12  Dressing Up Images with Layer Styles     251
or layers containing pixels). You can then erase portions of the new layers, 
apply artistic filters, or otherwise customize each effect layer. Remember that 
after a layer style is rasterized with this command, you can no longer edit it 
through the Layer Style dialog box, but the original style (if you added it to the 
Styles panel) is still available.
»
» Hide All Effects: You can temporarily hide a layer style with the Hide All 
Effects command. Alternatively (and more conveniently), you can click the 
eyeball icon next to the layer style in the Layers panel to hide the effects.
»
» Scale Effects: Use the Scale Effects command to uniformly make the layer 
style larger or smaller.
Exploring the Layer Style dialog box
The first step in creating custom layer styles is to become familiar with the indi-
vidual layer effects. Each of the ten effects available in the Layer Style dialog box 
(see Figure 12-7) has its own set of options. Most of the basic default values are 
very good starting points. You might need to change only a color or perhaps adjust 
a Size, Distance, or Opacity slider. You can, of course, do lots and lots of custom-
izing for some of the effects.
In the column to the left in the Layer Style dialog box, you can select a check box 
to apply the effect, but you need to click the name of the effect to open that effect’s 
options pane. In Figure 12-7, the check marks show that this particular layer style 
FIGURE 12-7: 
The Layer Style 
dialog box 
has separate 
options for 
each layer 
effect.

252     PART 3  Creating “Art” in Photoshop
includes a bevel, a stroke, color and pattern overlays, and a drop shadow. The 
options pane for Bevel and Emboss is visible, as you can tell by the highlighting 
in the left column (not to mention the subtle Bevel & Emboss at the top-center of 
the dialog box). And in the far right of the Layer Style dialog box, note the Pre-
view check box (upper right, which shows what the layer style will look like) and 
the small sample just below. That sample shows how your style will look when 
applied to a square about 140x140 pixels. (The new larger size is great — the pre-
view in earlier versions was a tiny 55x55 pixels and hardly useable.)
Take a look at the bottom of the Layer Style dialog box in Figure 12-7 to see the 
buttons Make Default and Reset to Default. In addition to saving a new layer style 
every time you hit upon a winning combination of settings, you can make those 
favorite settings the default. Change your mind later? One click is all it takes to 
reset to Photoshop’s defaults.
As you read the descriptions of the various sets of options, keep in mind some 
generalities about a few key options that you’ll see a number of times:
»
» Color Selection: When you see a color swatch — a small rectangle or square, 
usually near the Blending Mode option — you can click it to open the Color 
Picker and select a different color.
»
» Noise: When you see the Noise slider, you can add a speckling effect to help 
diffuse a glow or shadow.
»
» Contour: Glows, shadows, and the like can be applied linearly, with a steady 
fade from visible to not visible. Or you can elect to have that transition vary 
with a nonlinear contour. Generally speaking, nonlinear contours can be great 
for bevels, but linear is usually best for shadows and glows unless you intend 
to create concentric halos.
»
» Angle/Use Global Light: You can change the angle for several layer effects by 
entering a specific angle in the numeric field or by dragging in the circular 
Angle controller. If the Use Global Light check box is selected, you change all 
the angles for that layer style.
Layer effects basics
In this section, I explain the basics of each of the ten layer effects, showing the 
options available in the Layer Style dialog box for that effect in an insert, as well as 
one or more examples. And don’t forget to take a look at the nearby sidebar, “The 
four key blending modes.” Later in this chapter, you can read about the Opacity 
and the Fill sliders as well as some other advanced blending options.

CHAPTER 12  Dressing Up Images with Layer Styles     253
Bevel and Emboss
Perhaps the most fun of all the Photoshop layer effects, Bevel and Emboss is a 
quick and easy way to add a 3D look to your artwork. You can apply a Bevel and 
Emboss layer effect to text or to buttons for your website. You can also use this 
effect to create more complex elements in your artwork, examples of which appear 
in Figure 12-8.
When you feel the need and have the time to let your imagination frolic through 
the fertile fields of Photoshop fun, filters are first, but the Bevel and Emboss layer 
effect follows fruitfully. Take the time to play with the various settings in the 
Bevel and Emboss pane of the Layer Style dialog box to see what they do. Add 
a new layer, create a simple shape (perhaps with one of the shape tools), select 
Bevel and Emboss from the pop-up menu at the bottom of the Layers panel, and 
experiment — that’s a far more efficient way to get to know this effect than read-
ing technical explanations of each of the options. (One caveat: You won’t see any 
change in your layer with the Stroke Emboss style unless you’re also using the 
Stroke layer effect.) Don’t forget to play with the various Gloss Contour presets! 
Remember, too, that you can add a second contour effect and/or a texture using 
the two check boxes below Bevel and Emboss in the left column of the Layer Styles 
dialog box. (As with other effects, click directly on the name Contour or Texture to 
access the effect’s options.)
As you read this book, keep an eye out for the Bevel and Emboss layer effect. When 
you come across a bevel or emboss effect, such as those shown in Figure 12-9, you 
might want to take a moment to remember your experimentation and then try to 
puzzle out what settings I might have used.
FIGURE 12-8: 
The Bevel and 
Emboss layer 
effect is very 
versatile.

254     PART 3  Creating “Art” in Photoshop
Stroke
As you read this chapter, you’ll see the Stroke layer effect often. Many of the insets 
from the Layer Style dialog box in this section’s figures have a one-pixel black 
Stroke layer effect applied. Adding that tiny stroke helps set off the dialog box 
from the background.
Not only is Stroke a handy and practical production tool, but it’s also a wonder-
ful creative effect, too, especially when you use it in conjunction with other layer 
effects. For example, a stroke of a contrasting color is a great way to redefine 
the edge of your object when working with an outer glow and an inner shadow. 
(In the Stroke effect’s options, remember that you click the color swatch to open 
the Color Picker.) A simple stroke can convert even the plainest text into an eye-
catching statement. And don’t forget that without the Stroke effect, the Bevel and 
Emboss effect’s Stroke Emboss option does nothing for your artwork. Figure 12-10  
has a few examples of layer styles that include a Stroke effect.
FIGURE 12-9: 
Many illustra-
tions in this 
book use the 
Bevel and 
Emboss layer 
effect.
FIGURE 12-10:

effect can

effects.

CHAPTER 12  Dressing Up Images with Layer Styles     255
Inner Shadow
You can do a couple of things with the Inner Shadow layer effect, as you can see 
in Figure 12-11. Compare the two sets of options. On the left, a soft, light-colored 
inner shadow using the Screen blending mode softens edges. On the right, a hard 
inner shadow, using a dark color and the Multiply blending mode, produces a 
totally different look. Despite what your eyes might be telling you, the layer effect 
is applied to the red shape on the upper layer.
Inner Glow
The Inner Glow effect is much like a non-directional Inner Shadow effect. As you 
can see in Figure 12-12, an Inner Glow can be the base for a neon glow style. (Add 
an Outer Glow effect, perhaps a Stroke effect, and there you go!)
FIGURE 12-11: 
Inner shadows 
can be soft 
or hard, light 
or dark.
FIGURE 12-12: 
Inner Glow 
offers more 
control than 
Inner Shadow.

256     PART 3  Creating “Art” in Photoshop
You can also develop some rather amazing styles by using the Inner Glow and the 
Inner Shadow in combination. Using similar Size settings and varying the colors 
and blending modes lets you overlay a pair of effects in combination. And when 
you play with Inner Glow and Inner Shadow in combination, don’t overlook the 
Contour variations.
Satin
The Satin layer effect uses the shape of the object to produce a wave-like overlay. 
As you can see in Figure 12-13, it’s more effective with type and complex shapes 
than it is with large plain shapes.
Color Overlay
The key to using the Color Overlay layer effect is the blending mode. (See the 
sidebar, “The four key blending modes” earlier in this chapter.) When you use 
Normal, in effect, you paint all the pixels on the layer with the selected color. To 
blend the color with the original artwork or other effects (such as pattern over-
lays), choose an appropriate blending mode — Multiply with dark colors, Screen 
with light colors — or simply experiment with blending modes. However, using 
the Color Overlay layer effect with the Normal blending mode in a custom layer 
style is a good way to ensure consistency in artwork, such as buttons and banners 
THE FOUR KEY BLENDING MODES
Photoshop offers over two dozen different blending modes, many of which you see 
in the Layer Style dialog box. You really need only a few on a regular basis, although 
it’s always fun to experiment with the others, just in case one of them gives you a cool 
effect.
The Multiply blending mode generally darkens. When working with dark shadows or 
glows, choose the Multiply blending mode so that the layer effect darkens (but doesn’t 
hide completely) the pixels on the layers below. The Screen blending mode lightens. Use 
Screen with light glows and other such effects. The Overlay blending mode is a mix of 
Multiply and Screen. When working with patterns that contain both dark and light colors, 
you might opt for Overlay as the blending mode.
Of course you should remember the Normal blending mode, too! If you want a glow or 
shadow to completely block whatever lies below, choose Normal at 100% opacity. You 
might also want to use Normal with a somewhat lower opacity for a uniform coverage 
over both dark and light pixels. And don’t be afraid to experiment — run through the 
blending modes (and opacity settings) to see whether you can tweak that custom style 
just a little more. (For more information on blending modes, see the appendix.)

CHAPTER 12  Dressing Up Images with Layer Styles     257
for a website. Keep in mind, however, that Cover Overlay at 100% opacity used 
with the Normal blending mode completely hides any Gradient Overlay or Pattern 
Overlay effect.
Although you’ll generally find Color Overlay most useful for simple shapes in art-
work and on web pages, you can certainly use it for more exciting effects, such as 
the ones shown in Figure 12-14. The original is in the upper left, and each example 
shows the color, blending mode, and opacity selected. Remember that when you use 
a layer effect, you can later return and alter or remove that change from your image.
Gradient Overlay
Unlike the Gradient Map adjustment (see Chapter 6), which applies a gradient to 
your image according to the tonality of the original, the Gradient Overlay effect 
simply slaps a gradient over the top of the layer content, using the blending mode 
FIGURE 12-13: 
The Satin 
layer effect is 
very effective 
with complex 
shapes.
FIGURE 12-14:

can produce 
subtle or 
dramatic 
changes in 
your artwork.

258     PART 3  Creating “Art” in Photoshop
and opacity that you select. You also control the shape of the gradient, the angle 
at which it’s applied, and the gradient’s scale. (See Figure 12-15.) And don’t forget 
that a Gradient Overlay using the Normal blending mode and 100% opacity will 
hide any Pattern Overlay effect.
When working with gradients, you click the triangle to the right of the gradient 
sample to open the Gradient panel. You directly click the gradient sample itself 
to open the Gradient Editor. (See Chapter 14 for more information on editing and 
creating gradients.)
Pattern Overlay
Like the Color Overlay layer effect, Pattern Overlay relies on the blending mode 
and opacity settings to determine how the artwork (pattern) that it overlays inter-
acts with your original artwork. As you see in Figure  12-16, you can scale the 
pattern, align it to the upper-left corner of your image (with the Snap to Origin 
button), and link the pattern to your layer so that the appearance of your artwork 
doesn’t change as you drag the layer into position. Click the triangle to the right of 
the sample pattern to open the Pattern panel and then select a pattern.
Outer Glow
The Outer Glow layer effect is much like a non-directional shadow when applied 
using a dark color. However, it also has a variety of uses with a light color and the 
Screen blending mode. As you can see in Figure 12-17, it has practical and whimsi-
cal uses. (Please remember that in real life, stars do not appear between the horns 
of a crescent moon!)

layer effect 
(seen here on 
the left) is a

260     PART 3  Creating “Art” in Photoshop
In the Structure area at the top of the Outer Glow options, you can select the 
blending mode and opacity, add noise if desired, and select between a color (click 
the swatch to open the Color Picker) or a gradient (click the sample to open the 
Gradient Editor). You define the size and fade of the glow in the Elements area. 
The Technique pop-up menu offers both Softer and Precise — try them both. And 
don’t overlook the options at the bottom, in the Quality area. Although you use Jit-
ter only with gradients to add some randomness, the Range slider is an excellent 
way to control the distance at which your glow is offset. When you get a chance, 
play with different contours for an Outer Glow effect.
Drop Shadow
A drop shadow is a great way to separate the content of one layer from the rest 
of the image, as you can see by comparing the two versions of the artwork in 
Figure 12-18. In effect, the content of the target layer is copied, converted to black, 
and placed behind your layer. The blending mode and opacity determine how the 
shadow interacts with the layers below. You decide how much to offset and blur 
the duplicate with the sliders. (Remember that this is a layer style, so no extra 
layer is actually added to your image.) You’ll generally want to leave the Contour 
option of your drop shadows set to the linear default. As you saw in Figure 12-6, 
drop shadows are great with type layers!
Opacity, fill, and advanced blending
In the Blending Options area of the Layer Style dialog box and the upper-right 
corner of the Layers panel, you see a pair of adjustments named Opacity and Fill 
Opacity, as shown in Figure 12-19. Both have an impact on the visibility of the 
content of your layer.
FIGURE 12-18: 
Drop shadows 
can visually 
separate the 
upper layer 
from the lower 
layer.

CHAPTER 12  Dressing Up Images with Layer Styles     261
When you reduce the Opacity setting for the layer, you make the layer content 
and any layer style partially or completely transparent. Reducing the Fill slider 
changes the opacity of the pixels on the layer but leaves any layer effects fully 
visible. When might you want to use the Fill slider? The first thing that comes to 
mind is when creating the ever-popular Glass Type technique, which produces 
see-through text that’s perfect for your copyright notice on any image:
1.	 Add some text to an image with the Type tool.
This is a wonderful trick for adding your copyright information to sample 
images because everyone can see the image, but no one can use it without 
your permission. Start by adding your copyright information or perhaps the 
word Sample.
2.	 Apply a layer style to the type layer.
A bevel, a thin black stroke, and perhaps an inner shadow or white outer glow 
make an excellent combination. (Select the individual effects as described 
earlier in this chapter.)
3.	 Reduce the Fill slider to 0%.
Adjust Fill at the top of the Layers panel or in the Layer Style dialog box’s 
Blending Options pane. You can click and type in the Fill field, click the arrow to 
the right of the field and drag the slider, or simply click the word Fill and drag to 
the left. The type layer disappears, but the layer effect remains.
You can see all three steps in Figure 12-20.
FIGURE 12-19: 
The Opacity 
and Fill Opacity 
sliders control 
the visibility of 
a layer.

262     PART 3  Creating “Art” in Photoshop
The Blending Options pane of the Layer 
Style dialog box offers you a number of 
other choices in the Advanced Blending 
area, as shown in Figure 12-19.
Other than the Fill Opacity slider, you’ll 
probably never change the Advanced Blend-
ing options from their default settings, but 
you might be curious about what they do. 
Here’s a short explanation of each:
»
» Channels: Clear one or more of the color 
check boxes in the Advanced Blending 
area to hide the layer’s content in that 
color channel. Clear the R check box, for 
example, and you hide the target layer in 
the Red channel.
»
» Knockout: You can use the content on the target layer to create transparency 
on lower layers. The top layer becomes transparent, as do the layers below 
every place that the upper layer had visible pixels. (I think of it as a “cookie 
cutter” effect.) If you want to restrict the effect, use the Shallow option, and 
the knockout extends only to the lowest layer in your layer group. The Deep 
option knocks out to the Background layer (or to transparency if your image 
doesn’t have a background layer).
»
» Blend Interior Effects as Group: You can blend the Inner Glow, Satin, and 
your overlay effects before the layer as a whole is blended with lower layers. 
Use this option if it seems your layer effect’s blending mode is being canceled 
out by the layer’s own blending mode.
»
» Blend Clipped Layers as Group: If you have layers clipped together (see 
Chapter 10), you can elect to use the base layer’s blending mode for all the 
layers or let each layer interact independently. You generally want to leave 
this check box selected.
»
» Transparency Shapes Layer: This is another option that you’ll almost always 
want active. Transparency Shapes Layer restricts the layer style to the visible 
pixels on the target layer. If, for example, you’re working with a small rounded 
rectangle and a Color Overlay layer effect, deselecting the check box fills the 
entire layer — not just the rounded rectangle — with color.
»
» Layer Mask Hides Effects: If the target layer’s visibility is controlled with a 
layer mask (see Chapter 8), you can opt to have the layer style hidden by the 
FIGURE 12-20: 
Using the Glass Type effect is a great way 
to add copyright info to sample images.

CHAPTER 12  Dressing Up Images with Layer Styles     263
mask, too. You can also use a layer mask to hide just the layer style with this 
option — say, when you need to make sure that your drop shadow doesn’t 
fall where it shouldn’t. Simply create a layer mask that hides those areas 
where you don’t want the style visible and select the Layer Mask Hides Effects 
check box.
»
» Vector Mask Hides Effects: This option uses a layer’s vector mask in exactly 
the same way that the Layer Mask Hides Effects option uses a layer mask. 
(Remember that a vector mask is a path that determines which areas of a layer 
are visible — see Chapter 11 for information on creating vector masks with 
paths.)
If you have an image with a plain white (or plain black) background, you can make 
that background disappear with the Blend If sliders. (See Figure 12-21.) In the 
Layers panel, unlock the Background layer by clicking the Lock icon to the right 
of the layer name. At the bottom of the Layers panel, click the second button from 
the right to add a new layer. Move the new layer below the original layer. With the 
original layer active, open the Blending Options pane of the Layer Style dialog box 
and drag the upper-right Blend If slider control to the left until the background 
disappears. As the white background disappears, the checkerboard transparency 
grid becomes visible. Press ⌘  +E (Mac)/Ctrl+E (Windows) to merge the layers and 
retain the now-transparent background.
Saving Your Layer Styles
Creating custom styles takes some time and effort. Saving the styles means that 
you don’t have to spend time re-creating the style. Save your styles not only in the 
Styles panel but also on your hard drive.
FIGURE 12-21:

background

the Blend If 
sliders.

264     PART 3  Creating “Art” in Photoshop
Adding styles to the Styles panel
After you have your layer style looking just right, you can add it to the Styles 
panel. From the Styles panel, you can apply your custom style to any layer (except, 
of course, layers named Background) in any image with a single click. You simply 
make the target layer active in the Layers panel by clicking it; click your custom 
style in the Styles panel.
To add your style to the Styles panel, you must first create it. Select a layer in 
the Layers panel, open the Layer Style dialog box, and select the layer effects and 
options. Click the New Style button to save the style or, after clicking OK in the 
Layer Style dialog box, click the middle button at the bottom of the Styles panel. 
Then, in the New Style dialog box that appears, assign your custom style a name 
and click OK. If desired, you can also elect to save the target layer’s blending mode 
as part of the layer style.
Preserving your layer styles
Adding your custom styles to the Styles panel makes them available day in and 
day out as you work with Photoshop. However, should you ever need to replace the 
Preferences file (see Chapter 3) or reinstall the program, all your custom styles are 
wiped from the Styles panel. To make sure that you don’t accidentally lose your 
custom styles, create and save a set of styles, which you can then reload into the 
panel whenever necessary.
The Styles panel menu offers the Save 
Styles command (refer to Figure 12-4),  
which lets you save all the styles cur-
rently in the panel as a set. However, 
for more control — to actually select 
which styles you want in your set — 
use Photoshop’s Preset Manager. (See 
Figure 12-22.) You can open the Preset 
Manager from either the Styles panel 
menu or through the Edit ➪ Presets 
menu. (Make sure that you retain the 
.asl extension in the filename so that 
Photoshop recognizes the file as a set 
of styles!)
FIGURE 12-22: 
Use the Preset Manager to make sure your 
custom styles are safe.

CHAPTER 12  Dressing Up Images with Layer Styles     265
As shown in Figure 12-22, you use Preset Manager to save many kinds of custom 
bits and pieces. And use it you should! Shift+click to select a series of items or 
⌘  +click/Ctrl+click to select individual items; then click the Save Set button. Give 
the set a name (again, with the .asl file extension), pick a location, and click OK.
Saving sets of styles, brushes, custom shapes, and the like in the Photoshop Pre-
sets folder adds those sets to the various panels’ menus. That makes it quite easy 
to load the set into the panel: Just choose the set from the panel menu. How-
ever, you should also save a copy of the set someplace safe, outside the Photo-
shop folder, so it doesn’t accidentally get deleted when you upgrade or (horror!) 
reinstall.


CHAPTER 13  Giving Your Images a Text Message     267
Giving Your Images 
a Text Message
U
n bon croquis vaut mieux qu’un long discours. Or, as folks often paraphrase 
Napoleon, “A picture is worth a thousand words.” (Yes, 1,000 words might 
equal “a long speech.”) But sometimes in your Photoshop artwork, noth-
ing says Bob’s Hardware quite like the very words Bob’s Hardware. A picture of a 
hammer and a picture of a nail — perhaps toss in some nuts and bolts — all are 
great symbols for your client’s logo. However, you also need to give Bob’s cus-
tomers a name and an address so they can actually spend some money, which 
goes a long way toward helping Bob pay you.
For a program that’s designed to work with photographic images, Photoshop has 
incredibly powerful text capabilities. Although it’s not a page-layout program 
such as Adobe InDesign, a web development program such as Dreamweaver, or a 
word processing program such as Microsoft Word, Photoshop can certainly enable 
you to add lines, paragraphs, or even columns of text to your images.
Photoshop offers you three categories of text:
»
» Point type is one or more lines of text, comparable with the headlines in a 
newspaper or the text that you add to, say, a Bob’s Hardware advertisement. 
Click with a type tool to add point type.

268     PART 3  Creating “Art” in Photoshop
»
» Paragraph type consists of multiple lines of text. Like in a word processing 
program, a new line is started whenever your typing reaches the margin. Drag 
a type tool to create paragraph type.
»
» Warp type and type on a path are typically single lines of type that are bent, 
curved, or otherwise distorted as a special effect. Use the Option bar’s Warp Text 
feature (or choose Edit ➪ Transform ➪ Warp), or click with a type tool on a path.
In this chapter, I discuss the tools and panels that you use to add text to an image, 
how to add paragraphs and columns of text (as you might use in a brochure or 
booklet), and even how to make your type bend and twist along paths.
Making a Word Worth a Thousand Pixels
To control your basic work with text, Photoshop offers you four type tools, the 
Options bar, and several options in the Preferences dialog box, both in the Type 
section, visible in Figure 13-1, and in the Units & Rulers section. Photoshop also 
has a menu of type-related commands (shown in Figure 13-2).
As you can see in Figure 13-1, the Font menus in the Options bar can show a sam-
ple of the typeface (using the word Sample) when you click it. You can activate the 
preview and choose from 6 (including None) different sizes for the font preview 
in the Type menu’s Font Preview Size list (shown are Small, Large, and Huge).
In addition to the Type menu shown in Figure 13-2, you’ll also find four panels for 
more advanced work with text. Along with the Character and Paragraph panels, 
Photoshop offers Character Styles and Paragraph Styles panels. (See Figure 13-2.) 
By default, the panels are hidden because you can make the major type-related 
decisions (such as font style and alignment) right in the Options bar. You might 
need to show the panels if you’re doing some fine-tuning of the text appearance. 
When you need the panels, you can show them through the Type ➪ Panels menu 
or Photoshop’s Window menu.
Type can be informative or decorative or both. You can use the type tools to 
add paragraphs of text or a single character as an element of your artwork. (In 
Chapter  11, you can even see how to make custom shapes from your various 
symbol fonts.) The text can be plain and unadorned or elaborately dressed up 
with layer styles, such as drop shadows, glows, bevel effects, and other effects 
that you apply to make the layer content fancier. (Layer styles are discussed in 
­Chapter 12.) However you use it, text can be a powerful element of both commu-
nication and symbolism. Take a look at Figure 13-3, in which I use the Type tool to 
add the binary code to the left and even the musical notes below. (You can see the 
­individual layers of Figure 13-3 back in Figure 10-1.)

CHAPTER 13  Giving Your Images a Text Message     269
But before you add any text to your artwork, you need to have a good handle on 
the various type tools, panels, menus, and options available to you. I start with an 
introduction to Photoshop’s type tools.
FIGURE 13-1:

270     PART 3  Creating “Art” in Photoshop
A type tool for every season, or reason
Photoshop offers four type tools — or, perhaps more accurately, two pairs of type 
tools  — that assist you with adding text to your images. The Horizontal Type 
tool and the Vertical Type tool (the first pair) create type layers, which show up as 
special layers in the Layers panel that enable you to later re-edit the text that you 
put there. The Horizontal Type Mask tool and the Vertical Type Mask tool (the 
second pair) make selections on the active layer, similar to using the Rectangular 
Marquee and Lasso tools (as I describe in Chapter 8). When creating more than 
one line of type, the Horizontal Type tool starts the subsequent lines below the 
first. Keep in mind, however, that the Vertical Type tool will add additional lines 
of type to the left of the first line.
When working with type layers, you can easily make changes to the font, font size, 
and even the text itself at any time. In addition, you can add layer styles and blend 
the text with other elements of your artwork using blending modes and reduced 
opacity.
You can ignore the type mask tools. Instead, use the regular type tools, ⌘  /
Ctrl+click the layer thumbnail in the Layers panel to load a selection in the shape 
of the text, and then click the eyeball symbol to the left to hide the type layer. 
Later, if necessary, you can easily reload the selection — or make changes to the 
text and load a new selection.
FIGURE 13-3: 
You can also 
use type as 
symbolic or 
decorative 
­elements.

CHAPTER 13  Giving Your Images a Text Message     271
When working with a text-shaped selection, add a new empty layer on which you 
can create a text-shaped stroke or fill, or work with an existing layer’s content. 
You might, for example, make a text-shaped selection to delete or hide an area of 
another layer, as you can see in Figure 13-4.
Whether working with type layers (or 
the type mask tools), you have the 
option of using either horizontal or 
vertical type. The difference between 
type that is set vertically and the 
very common horizontal type rotated  
90 degrees is illustrated in Figure 13-5.
You can select type options before 
adding text to the image, or you can 
change your options afterward. When 
you make the type layer active in 
the Layers panel  — but haven’t yet 
selected any text in your image — any 
changes that you make are applied to 
all the text on the layer. You can also 
click and drag to select some of the 
text on the layer and make changes to 
only those characters or words.

of a number of ways:

» Click the check mark button (or the Cancel button) on the Options bar.
»
» Switch to a different tool in the Toolbox.
»
» Press ⌘  +Return or Ctrl+Enter.
»
» ⌘  +Shift+click or Ctrl+Shift+click to finish that type layer and start a new type 
layer.
The Type tool’s Options bar also includes a 3D button to convert the type layer to 
a 3D object. (You’ll find an overview of 3D in Chapter 18.)
By default, when adding type, pressing the Escape key deletes the type layer 
and the type you have added. Now, however, you can elect to have the Escape 
key commit the text and end the editing session. The option can be activated in 
Preferences ➪ Type.
What are all those options?
Here you are, the proud owner of the world’s state-of-the-art image editor, and 
now you’re adding text, setting type, and pecking away on the keyboard. You’re 
faced with a lot of variables. Which options are you going to need all the time? 
Which ones are you going to need now and then? Which ones can you ignore 
altogether? Read on as I introduce you to the various text and type variables, and 
toss in a few general guidelines on which options are most (and least) frequently 
required.
Take a look at Figure 13-6, in which you can see (in all their glory) the most com-
monly used text attributes, all of which are available to you from the Options bar 
whenever a type tool is active.

attributes of 
your text.

CHAPTER 13  Giving Your Images a Text Message     273
You can change the following text attributes via the Options bar, which is usually 
available at the top of your screen:
»
» Tool Presets: The Tool Presets panel enables you to select a predefined set of 
options that you’ve already saved. Set up each as a preset and then activate all 
the options with a single click. (See Chapter 3 for more detailed information 
on tool presets.)
»
» Orientation: The Orientation button toggles existing type layers between 
horizontal and vertical. Regardless of what text is selected, the entire type 
layer is flipped when you click this button.
»
» Font menu: Click the triangle to the right of the Font Family field to open the 
Font menu, showing all your active fonts in alphabetical order. You can also 
click in the field itself and use the arrow keys to switch fonts. If you select 
some type with a type tool first (as shown in Figure 13-7), using an arrow key 
automatically applies the change to the selected characters. If no characters 
are selected, you change the entire type layer.
»
» Font Style: When a font has 
multiple styles built in, you can 
choose a variation of the font from 
the Font Style menu. Styles include 
Regular (or Roman), Bold, Semibold, 
Italic, Condensed, Light, and 
combinations thereof (as shown in 
Figure 13-8). Some fonts, however, 
have no built-in styles.
»
» Font Size: You can select a font size 
in three ways: by typing a number in 
the Font Size field, by clicking the 
triangle to the right of the field and 
FIGURE 13-7: 
Select specific 
characters, 
such as 
the words 
­SELECTING 
THEM, to 
change some, 
or make no 
selection to 
change all.
FIGURE 13-8: 
Some fonts have many styles available.

274     PART 3  Creating “Art” in Photoshop
selecting a font size from the pop-up menu that appears, or by clicking the Tt 
icon to the left of the Font Size field and then dragging left or right to change 
the value in the field. Font size is generally measured in points (1 point = 1 72 
inch), but you can elect to use pixels or millimeters. Make the units change in 
Photoshop’s Preferences (choose Preferences ➪ Units & Rulers, not 
Preferences ➪ Type). Keep in mind that when type is measured in points, the 
image’s resolution comes into play. (Resolution is discussed in Chapter 2.)
»
» Anti-aliasing: Anti-aliasing softens the edges of each character so that it 
appears smooth on-screen. As part of this process, anti-aliasing hides the 
corners of the individual pixels with which the text is created. When outputting 
to a laser printer or other PostScript device, anti-aliasing isn’t required. It is, 
however, critical when printing to an inkjet or when producing web graphics or 
designing for tablets and smartphones. Smooth is a good choice unless your 
text begins to look blurry, in which case you should switch to Crisp. Use the 
Strong option with very large type when the individual character width must 
be preserved. When designing for on-screen projects (web pages, tablets, 
smartphones, and so on), choose System or System Gray for anti-aliasing.
Never choose System or System Gray for text that will be printed, either on an 
inkjet or using a PostScript device. These two anti-aliasing methods are 
designed to help text appear properly in web browsers.
»
» Alignment: The three alignment choices on the Options bar determine how 
lines of type are positioned relative to each other. The buttons do a rather 
eloquent job of expressing themselves, wouldn’t you say? Note: Don’t confuse 
the term alignment with justification, which straightens both the left and right 
margins (and is selected in the Paragraph panel).
»
» Type color: Click the color swatch on the Options bar to open the Color Picker 
and select a type color. You can select a color before adding text, or you can 
change the color of the text later. If you start by selecting a type layer from the 
Layers panel, you’ll change all the characters on that layer when you select a 
new color in the Color Picker. Alternatively, use a type tool to select one or 
more characters for a color change, as shown in Figure 13-9.
»
» Warp Text: Warp Text, which I discuss later in this chapter, bends the line of 
type according to any number of preset shapes, each of which can be 
customized with sliders. (The text in Figure 13-9 uses the Arc Lower warp 
style.) Keep in mind, however, that the Warp Text feature isn’t available when 
the Faux Bold style is applied through the Character panel. (I talk about faux 
styles later in this chapter.)
»
» 3D: After you click the Type tool in your image, the last button on the Type 
tool’s Options bar is active and you can create a 3D object from the text. (3D is 
discussed in Chapter 18.) Also appearing (just to the left of the 3D button) 
when in the process of adding text are new buttons to reject the text (deleting 
the type layer) and a checkmark button to accept and end the text editing.

CHAPTER 13  Giving Your Images a Text Message     275
Each character in a type layer can have its own attributes. Click and drag over 
one or more characters with a type tool and then use the Options bar or Character 
panel to change the text attributes. Color, font, style — just about any attribute 
can be assigned as shown in Figure 13-9.
Like many word processing programs, you can select an entire word in Photoshop 
by double-clicking the word (with a type tool). Triple-click to select the entire 
line. Quadruple-click to select the entire paragraph. Click five times very fast to 
select all the text on that layer.
Taking control of your text with panels
For incredible control over the appearance of your text, use the Character and 
Paragraph panels. In addition to all the text attributes available on the Options 
bar, the panels provide a wide range of choices. With them, you can customize 
the general appearance of the text or apply sophisticated typographic styling. The 
Character and Paragraph panels can be shown and hidden by clicking the Panels 
button near the right end of any type tool’s Options bar or through the Window 
menu.
You can use the Character panel to edit a single selected character, a series of 
selected characters, or the entire content of a type layer. Figure 13-10 shows what 
you face when “building character” using this panel.
FIGURE 13-9:

276     PART 3  Creating “Art” in Photoshop
When an OpenType font is selected in the upper-left field, the Character panel 
offers OpenType options as buttons. Which buttons are grayed out and which are 
available depends on which features are built into that particular OpenType font.
Unless you’re a typographer, a number of the fields in the Character panel might 
require explanation:
»
» Leading: Leading (pronounced LED-ding rather than LEED-ing and which refers 
to the lead strips of metal that typesetters used to place between lines of 
type) is the vertical space between lines of text. Generally, you’ll leave Leading 
set to Auto. However, you can select one or more lines of text (select the 
whole line) and change the spacing. Adding more space gives the text an airy, 
light appearance. Reducing the leading tightens up the text, which enables 
you to fit more lines in the same area.
»
» Kerning: The space between two characters is determined by the kerning 
built into a font. You can, however, override that spacing. Click with a type tool 
between two letters and then change the setting in the Kerning field to change 
the distance between the letters. You might, for example, want to reduce the 
kerning between a capital P and a lowercase o to tuck the second character 
protectively under the overhang of the taller letter. This can produce a cleaner 
and better-connected relationship between the two characters.
»
» Scaling: Vertical and horizontal scaling modifies the height and width of the 
selected character(s). You’ll find this useful primarily for customizing short bits 
of type rather than long chunks of text.
FIGURE 13-10: 
More choices!

CHAPTER 13  Giving Your Images a Text Message     277
»
» Baseline Shift: Produce subscript and superscript characters, such as those 
used in H2O and E = mc2, with the Baseline Shift field. It’s generally easier to 
use the Superscript and Subscript styles (see the next bullet on faux styles).
»
» Faux Styles: Use faux styles to apply the appearance of a character style, 
even when they’re not built into the font. From the left, as the buttons show, 
the available faux styles are Bold, Italic, All Caps, Small Caps, Superscript, 
Subscript, Underline, and Strikethrough. Select the character or characters to 
which you want to apply the style, and then click the appropriate button or 
buttons. Generally speaking, if a font offers a specific style on the Font Style 
menu, you’ll use the font’s built-in style rather than the faux style. Remember 
that you can’t use Faux Bold when you want to warp text.
»
» OpenType Options: OpenType fonts, which can include many more glyphs 
(characters) than can TrueType or Type 1 fonts, may include a number of 
special features, including (from left) Standard Ligatures, Contextual 
Alternates, Discretionary Ligatures, Swashes, Stylistic Alternates, Titling 
Alternates, Ordinals, and Fractions. If you type certain character combinations, 
a single character, more visually pleasing, will be substituted. Not all 
OpenType fonts include all options.
»
» Dictionary: Photoshop has more than four dozen dictionaries built in. And, 
wonderfully or confusingly depending on your personal linguistic talents, you 
can assign dictionaries on a word-by-word (or even character-by-character) 
basis. You could, for example, insert a bon mot into the middle of your text in 
the language of your choice, assign the appropriate language dictionary, and 
not have that phrase trigger an alert when you run a spell check (which you do 
by choosing Edit ➪ Check Spelling).
If you click in your image window and start typing but no characters appear, check 
the Layers panel to make sure no layer is hiding your type layer and verify in the 
Options bar that your text color isn’t the same as the background over which 
you’re typing. If neither of those factors is the problem, it’s likely an invalid set-
ting in the Character panel (perhaps Baseline Shift). Press the Escape key, and 
then right-click on the Type tool icon at the left end of the Options bar and select 
Reset Tool.
You’ll probably find yourself using certain sets of options pretty regularly in Pho-
toshop. Luckily for you, you don’t need to make changes on the Options bar and 
Character panel every time you want to, for example, add headlines or titles in 
Minion Bold, 24 pt, no anti-aliasing, tracking +180, faux bold, with standard liga-
tures. Set up the options once and then click the Create New Tool Preset button 
in the panel at the left end of the Options bar, as shown in Figure 13-11. The next 
time that you want those specific text attributes, select the preset from that list or 
the Tool Presets panel, and you’re ready to type! (Also take a look at the “Working 
with Styles” section, later in this chapter.)

278     PART 3  Creating “Art” in Photoshop
The Paragraph panel is used, not surprisingly, 
with paragraph type. The alignment options that 
you see in the upper left of the Paragraph panel 
in Figure 13-12 can be applied to both point type 
and type on a path, but you can usually access 
your alignment options much more easily from 
the Options bar.
I use the term type container when I discuss the 
Paragraph panel and paragraph type. Think of it 
as a rectangular column of text, with the words 
flowing from line to line, just as they do when 
you compose e-mail or use a word processor. 
You drag a type tool to create the rectangle, and 
then you type inside that rectangle. In contrast, when you simply click a type tool 
and start typing, you need to press Return (Mac) or Enter (Windows) at the end 
of each line.
You can find specific information about some of these options later in the chap-
ter (when I discuss paragraph type), but here’s a quick look at the choices in the 
Paragraph panel:
»
» Alignment: As the text flows from line to line in your type container, the 
alignment option determines how the lines will stack. You can align the text for 
a straight left edge or a straight right edge, or you can have the lines stack 
centered upon each other.
»
» Justification: Unlike alignment, which balances one margin of a paragraph, 
justification equalizes both the left and right margins of a paragraph. As you 
can see by the icons, the difference among the four options is the last line in 
the paragraph. That last line can be aligned left, centered, aligned right, or 
stretched to fit from left to right (called full justification).
»
» Indent Margins: Paragraphs of text can be indented from the left margin or 
the right. Even if you have only a single word selected, the entire paragraph is 
FIGURE 13-11: 
Tool presets 
can save you 
lots of time.
FIGURE 13-12: 
Most of this panel is only for 
­paragraph type.

CHAPTER 13  Giving Your Images a Text Message     279
indented. Harkening back to that last term paper you wrote (whenever that 
might have been), think in terms of a block quote. You can also use negative 
numbers in the Indent Margin fields, which extends the paragraph beyond the 
margin.
»
» Indent First Line: You can indent the first line of your paragraphs (or extend 
the first line to the left past the margin with a negative value) without having 
to press the Tab key. The option can be set before you start adding text and is 
applied to each paragraph.
»
» Space Before/After: When your type container includes multiple paragraphs 
(created by pressing the Return/Enter key), you can specify the distance that’s 
automatically added between them. Rather than pressing the Return/Enter 
key an extra time between paragraphs, set the spacing in the Paragraph 
panel.
»
» Hyphenation: If you’re using justification rather than alignment, I recommend 
keeping the Hyphenate check box selected. When words at the ends of lines 
of justified type aren’t hyphenated, the spacing within the lines can get rather 
messy. If you don’t like the look of hyphens along the right margin, deselect 
the Hyphenate check box or change the hyphenation settings, as described 
later in this chapter.
Keep in mind that after you drag a type tool to create a type container, you can 
have as many paragraphs as fit. When you reach the end of a paragraph, press 
Return/Enter. A new paragraph is created within the type container. Consider the 
type container to be a column of text, such as you’d see in a newspaper, magazine, 
or newsletter.
The panel menus — even more options
Like most of Photoshop’s panels, clicking the Menu button in the upper-right 
corner of the Character or Paragraph panel opens the Panel menu, which holds a 
cornucopia of options you probably never need to see. (Consider this: If it were a 
really important option, it would be easier to get to, wouldn’t it?)
As you can see in Figure 13-13, not all menu options are available for all fonts. 
Some of the options are merely command forms of the panel menus (such as the 
faux styles). A number of the options apply only to OpenType fonts, which include a 
much larger selection of glyphs (characters) than do other fonts.

280     PART 3  Creating “Art” in Photoshop
Here are a couple of panel menu options with which you should be familiar:
»
» Fractional Widths: When selected, Photoshop uses this option to adjust the 
spacing between letters on an individual basis. Will you or I spot the differ-
ence? Not with large type, but if you’re creating small text (especially for the 
web or smart devices), deselect this option. How small is small? Generally 10 
points or smaller.
»
» System Layout: Unless you need to match the appearance of text in TextEdit 
for Mac or Windows Notepad, leave this option deselected. When might you 
need it? When designing interface items for a program or game.
»
» No Break: When working with paragraph type, you can select one or more 
words and choose No Break to prevent them from being hyphenated. You 
might want to do this with words that are difficult to recognize when split 
between two lines.
»
» Roman Hanging Punctuation: Found on the Paragraph panel menu, this 
option permits the smaller punctuation marks located at the left and right 
margins of justified text to hang out past the margins. When commas and the 
like are outside the margin, the margin itself has a cleaner look. Don’t use this 
option if your layout can’t handle text that extends past the edges of your 
column.
»
» Adobe Composer: This choice is actually quite simple: Single-Line Composer 
looks at one line of type to determine hyphenation. Every-Line Composer 
looks at the entire block of text, generally producing a more pleasing 
appearance.
»
» Reset (panel name): If you’re seeing some strange behavior from your type 
tools, you might want to invoke the Reset Character and Reset Paragraph 
FIGURE 13-13: 
Not all options 
are used with 
all fonts.

CHAPTER 13  Giving Your Images a Text Message     281
commands. They restore the settings in their respective panels to the defaults, 
eliminating any errant setting that might be causing the problem.
Remember that you can right-click the tool icon at the left end of the Options 
bar and select Reset Tool (or Reset All Tools) to immediately return to the tool’s 
default settings. If the Type tool doesn’t seem to be working correctly, reset and 
then reselect your options.
Working with Styles
The Character Style and Paragraph Style panels are shown in Figure 13-14. You 
define a character style based on the character format (font, size, style, and so 
on), the advanced format (scaling, baseline shift), and OpenType features (when 
working with an OpenType font, of course). Later, even in another document, you 
can load and apply the character style and instantly re-format the selected text in 
the style as defined.
A paragraph style includes all the features found in a character style, plus 
­paragraph-specific options, such as indentation, composition, justification, and 
hyphenation.
After applying a character style or paragraph style, you can select some or all of the 
text and make changes to any character or paragraph attribute. Keep in mind this 
hierarchy: Any attribute you define after assigning a style trumps the attribute as 
defined in that style. If both a paragraph style and a character style are applied to 
the same text, attributes defined in the character style trump those in the para-
graph style. Say, for example, that the paragraph style specifies Minion Pro as the 
font and the character style specifies Myriad Pro; the text will be Myriad Pro.
You can click the New Style button at the bottom of either panel, and then double-
click the style to open a panel in which you manually select each style attribute. 
(See Figure 13-14.) Alternatively, create some text and with that text selected, click 
the New Style button. The new style will use the attributes of the selected text.
FIGURE 13-14: 
Defining a 
character 
style (left) and 
a paragraph 
style.

282     PART 3  Creating “Art” in Photoshop
If you assign a style and then manually make changes to attributes, a small plus 
sign appears next to the style name in the panel. Later, if desired, click the left 
button at the bottom of the panel to restore the attributes with which the style 
was defined. The second button at the bottom of the panels redefines the style, 
incorporating those attributes you manually changed.
Styles are stored within a document saved in the PSD (Photoshop) format. 
For example, if you have styles in Document-1.psd that you’d like to use in  
Document-2.psd, here’s what you would do: Open Document-2.psd, open the 
appropriate styles panel, select the styles panel menu command Load Styles, nav-
igate to and select Document-1.psd, and then click the Open button.
You may never use the Character Styles and Paragraph Styles panels, especially if 
you already have numerous Type tool presets, but they are a very powerful way to 
speed formatting of text — and to ensure consistency from word to word, para-
graph to paragraph, and project to project.
Putting a picture in your text
Enough of that heavy stuff for now — time to take a look at one of the coolest 
things that you can do with text. Here’s an easy way to create a text-shaped pic-
ture, one that’s fully editable.
1.	 Using File ➪ Open or by double-clicking an image file, open a photo in 
Photoshop.
2.	 If the Layers panel has a layer named Background, click the Lock icon to 
the right of the layer name to unlock it. If the image has multiple layers, 
choose Layer ➪ Merge Visible.
You want to work with a single regular (not background) layer for this project. 
Background layers don’t support transparency, and no layers can be placed 
below a Background layer.
3.	 Add your type with the Horizontal Type tool.
4.	 Click the type layer in the Layers panel and drag it below the image layer.
5.	 In the Layers panel, Option+click (Mac) or Alt+click (Windows) the line 
between the two layers.
The two layers are joined together, as shown in Figure 13-15. When you clip 
two layers, the lower layer serves as a mask for the upper layer. The upper 
layer is visible only where the lower layer has pixels and adopts the opacity of 
those lower-layer pixels.

CHAPTER 13  Giving Your Images a Text Message     283
6.	 Finish the image with a layer style (applied to the lower layer) and any 
other artwork that the project requires.
You can click the lower layer in the Layers panel and then click a favorite layer 
style in the Styles panel. Or, of course, you can create a custom layer style by 
choosing Layer ➪ Layer Style. In Figure 13-16, you see a bevel, a stroke, and a 
slight inner glow applied to the type layer.
FIGURE 13-15:

284     PART 3  Creating “Art” in Photoshop
Creating Paragraphs with Type Containers
Although the vast majority of the text that you add to Photoshop artwork is point 
type — that is, type that exists on just one or a couple of lines — you’ll certainly 
find situations in which you need to use paragraph type in a type container. The 
primary advantage of using paragraph type is word wrap. While you type, the text 
automatically starts a new line every time it reaches the margin.
“Why is that a big deal?” you might ask. “I don’t mind pressing the Return or 
Enter key at the end of each line.” Ah, but consider the ever-present (when 
you type like me) typographical error! Or what if the very first sentence of your 
­manual-Return paragraph is missing a word? To insert that word and maintain a 
visually pleasing right margin, you’d need to go back and redo every line of type. 
With paragraph type, the content of each line automatically adjusts as you insert 
that forgotten word.
The difference between point type to create a column of type and paragraph type 
is comparable with the difference between a typewriter and a word processor. (If 
you’re old enough to remember Wite-Out and Liquid Paper, raise your hand, but 
not for very long — I don’t want to tire you out.)
Adding a type container is simple. Click and drag with the Horizontal Type tool 
(or, in some rare cases, you might want to use the Vertical Type tool), and then 
start typing. (Keep in mind that a paragraph of text created with the Vertical Type 
tool has the first line along the right margin and subsequent lines are added to the 
left, making for rather difficult reading.) The type automatically starts the next 
line as soon as you press enough keys to reach the far margin. You can keep typing 
until you fill the type container. Press Return or Enter whenever you want to start 
a new paragraph within your type container.
You can also copy/paste text from a word processing or text-editing program. You 
can, for example, open a Microsoft Word document in Word, select the text that 
you want by clicking and dragging, and then choose Edit ➪ Copy to place the text 
into the computer’s memory (on the Clipboard). Switch to your Photoshop docu-
ment; select a font, font size, and other attributes (or select a character style or 
paragraph style after pasting); drag a type container; and then choose Edit ➪ Paste 
(or the assigned keyboard shortcut) to place your text inside the container. When 
the text you need already exists, you not only save time by using copy/paste, but 
you also eliminate the possibility of introducing typos.
But what if you have more text than fits in the type container? Unlike Illustra-
tor and InDesign, you can’t link two type containers, enabling the excess text to 
automatically move to the next container. Photoshop does, however, remind you 
that your text doesn’t fit by showing you a symbol in the lower-right corner of the 
type container’s bounding box — the dashed line surrounding the type container. 

CHAPTER 13  Giving Your Images a Text Message     285
As you can see in Figure 13-17, the lower-right anchor point of the bounding box 
has a plus sign in it.
When you have more text than the type container can hold, you have a number of 
options:
»
» Enlarge the type container. Click one of the bounding box’s anchor points 
and drag to increase the size of the type container. Making a type container a 
little bit wider often gives you an extra line or two of text at the bottom.
»
» Shrink the font. Select the text with a keyboard shortcut (⌘  +A/Ctrl+A) and 
select a smaller font size on the Options bar.
»
» Decrease the space between lines. Select the text and decrease the 
leading — the amount of space between lines of type — in the Leading field 
found in the upper right of the Character panel. By default (the Auto setting in 
the Leading field), Photoshop uses an amount equal to 120 percent of the font 
size. You can often reduce the leading to 1 or 2 points larger than the font size 
before you start overlapping lowercase letters with descenders (g, j, p, q, and y) 
and uppercase letters on the line below.
»
» Edit the text. Rephrase the text, using fewer words to convey the same 
message. If you’re not the author, however, this option might not be available.
FIGURE 13-17: 
A plus sign in

anchor point 
warns you that 
text doesn’t 
fit in the type 
container.

286     PART 3  Creating “Art” in Photoshop
You can also use a path created with any of the Shape tools or the Pen tool as a type 
container. Select the tool, use the Options bar to set it to create a path (rather than 
a shape or pixels), then drag the tool in the image window. With that done, switch 
to the Type tool, click within the path, and add your text.
Selecting alignment or justification
Photoshop gives you several options for controlling the appearance of your mar-
gins. In the “Taking control of your text with panels” section, earlier in this chap-
ter, I outline a number of options that you can find on the Paragraph panel menu. 
But let me go into more detail about a couple of options that you have when add-
ing paragraph type.
Perhaps the most important decision (other than font and font size) that you 
make when preparing paragraph type is a choice of alignment or justification. 
When text is aligned left, the left margin is perfectly straight, and the right margin 
is ragged, with each line ending where it ends, without any relationship to the 
lines of type above and below. (The vast majority of the text you see in this book 
is left aligned.) A column of text that’s aligned right has a clean right margin and 
a ragged left margin. If you choose center aligned, the middle of each line of text is 
centered. Take a look at Figure 13-18 for a visual comparison.
Unlike alignment, justification gives you straight margins on both sides of the 
column of text. The four justification options to the right at the top of the Para-
graph panel (see Figure 13-13) differ only in how they treat the last line of a para-
graph. The last line can be independently aligned left, center, or right; or it can be 
FIGURE 13-18: 
Compare the 
left and right 
margins of 
each column  
of text.

CHAPTER 13  Giving Your Images a Text Message     287
fully justified, spreading the last line from margin to margin. You shouldn’t use 
the fourth option unless that last line (of every paragraph) is rather full because it 
looks rather strange when just a couple of words are stretched edge to edge.
Ready, BREAK! Hyphenating your text
When a word is too long to fit on 
the current line of text, either it can 
be moved to the beginning of the 
next line (wrapped) or it can be bro-
ken into two parts: one finishing the 
upper line and the other starting the 
next line (hyphenated). The default 
hyphenation settings are shown in 
Figure 13-19.
The hyphenation options are for the 
truly geeky, my-typography-is-my-life 
types. The defaults are excellent and 
can suffice for all but the most pre-
cise layouts (which you should be doing in InDesign or perhaps Illustrator, any-
way). If you want to fine-tune how hyphenation is applied (or have far too much 
time on your hands), select Hyphenate from the Paragraph panel menu to open the 
options shown in Figure 13-19. The Hyphenation check box (upper left) activates/ 
deactivates hyphenation. The top three fields govern which words to hyphenate 
and what limits to place on the hyphenation. (Think of the second and third fields 
as Hyphenate or cram into the line without hyphenating.) The lower two fields control 
the appearance of the margin, limiting the number of consecutive lines that can 
be hyphenated and the maximum distance from that margin that a hyphen can be 
placed.
Shaping Up Your Language with  
Warp Text and Type on a Path
You can change the line along which your type flows either by using the Warp Text 
feature or by typing on a path. Type warping uses predefined shapes to which your 
type is formed (and can be used with both point and paragraph type), and typing 
on a path uses a custom path (and is used only with point type).
FIGURE 13-19: 
Default hyphenation values give you good 
results and a pleasing appearance.

288     PART 3  Creating “Art” in Photoshop
Warping type and placing type along a path are great ways to spice up your mes-
sage as long as you don’t overdo it and make the message illegible or distract 
from the overall appearance of your artwork. Warp Text is a quick and easy way 
to bend text, whereas placing type on a path is a more complex  — and more 
controlled — technique.
Applying the predefined warps
With a type layer active in the Layers panel and a type tool selected, click the but-
ton to the right of the color swatch on the Options bar. That opens the Warp Text 
dialog box, as shown in Figure 13-20, in which you choose both the distortion you 
want to apply as well as the settings.
Photoshop offers 15 different Warp Text presets, each of which you can customize 
by dragging any of three sliders. Negative numbers can be used, too, reversing the 
warp. You can also set the Bend slider to 0 and adjust the lower two sliders to cre-
ate the appearance of depth or perspective for a type layer, but keep in mind that 
the Horizontal and Vertical buttons aren’t available for some of the styles. Warp 
Text is one of Photoshop’s truly fun features. The best way to become familiar 
with it is to open the dialog box and test-drive each of the variations. And don’t 
forget to try the Horizontal and Vertical buttons when they’re available!

CHAPTER 13  Giving Your Images a Text Message     289
Customizing the course with paths
You can use the shape tools or the Pen tool to create a custom path along which 
you add your text. (You find full information about paths and shapes in Chapter 11.)  
To add type along a path, simply select the Horizontal Type or Vertical Type tool, 
click the path, and type. The flow of the type from the point on the path where you 
click is determined by the alignment option that you select from the Options bar or 
the Paragraph panel. If the text is left aligned, characters are added to the right of 
the point where you click (called the point of origin for the type). Left alignment is 
great when adding type along an open path, such as the upper path in Figure 13-21. 
You might, however, want to choose center alignment when adding type along the 
top of an arc or circle, so you can click on the top of the arc and not worry about 
dragging the type later to center it.
If you want type to go in two different directions — say, pointed upward along 
both the top and the bottom of a circle — and you want the appearance to be uni-
form, with the same radius for each arc of text, create two separate paths and two 
separate type layers, as shown in Figure 13-22.
After you add your type to the path, you can press the ⌘  /Ctrl key and reposition 
the type along the path by dragging. When you press and hold ⌘  /Ctrl, the type 
tool’s cursor changes to an I-beam cursor with a heavy black arrow on either side, 
indicating which way you can drag the type. You see the type’s point of origin as a 
hollow diamond on the path (not to be confused with the hollow squares that rep-
resent the path’s anchor points). Figure 13-23 gives you a zoomed-in look at the 
FIGURE 13-21:

the path.

converted cursor and a comparison of the point of origin diamond and the anchor 
point square. Note, too, that not only can you drag type along a path, but you can 
also drag it across the path, flipping over the type.

CHAPTER 13  Giving Your Images a Text Message     291
After flipping type across a path, you might need to adjust the tracking (the space 
between characters), which is the second field from the top on the right in the 
Character panel. And don’t be afraid to click in the type and press the spacebar a 
few times to adjust the placement of words along the path.
A WORD ABOUT FONTS
You already have a nice selection of fonts installed on your computer. Some are installed 
with the operating system (Windows or Mac), a number of fonts may have been installed 
with your Adobe software, and other programs could have tossed more morsels into 
the stew. However, you might find that the more you work with text, the more you crave 
additional fonts.
The Type menu includes the Add Fonts from Typekit option. This command opens 
your browser and (assuming you’re online) takes you to Adobe’s Typekit website. In the 
Marketplace you can purchase fonts from some of the biggest names in the field of 
font design. You can use the boxes to the right to show only certain types of type (so to 
speak). In the Recommendations section, for example, you can elect to show only fonts 
appropriate for paragraph text or fonts designed to be used in headings.
Although having lots of fonts can stretch your options, too many fonts can lead to slow-
downs and other problems. If you do find yourself someday with a massive collection of 
fonts (I have over 12,000 fonts), none of which you could bear to part with (okay, I could 
part with some of them), use a font management utility. The Mac OS has the built-in Font 
Book, and Extensis (www.extensis.com) offers Suitcase Fusion for Mac and Windows 
(about $120 for three machines).


CHAPTER 14  Painting in Photoshop     293
Painting in Photoshop
P
ainting. The word evokes images of brushes and palettes and color being 
precisely applied to canvas. Or, perhaps, images of drop cloths, ladders, 
rollers, and buckets — color being slopped on a wall and spread around.  
It doesn’t generally bring to mind digital image editing. But painting certainly 
has a place in your arsenal of Photoshop skills, even if you never create an image 
from scratch.
In addition to painting landscapes and portraits (which you certainly can do in 
Photoshop, if you have the talent and training), you can use Photoshop’s painting 
tools for a variety of other tasks. For example, you can paint to create masks and 
layer masks, adjust tonality or sharpness in specific areas, repair blemishes and 
other damage in an image — even to create graphic elements and special effects.
In this chapter, I concentrate on those editing-related painting skills and give you 
a quick look at painting with the Mixer Brush tool and the airbrush and ­erodible 
brush tips (like a pencil that eventually needs sharpening). I introduce you to 
the basic concepts of painting in Photoshop and also walk you through the basic 
brush-related tools and the Brush and Brush Presets panels, concentrating on 
those features that you most likely need (as well as a few of the other, more artis-
tic features). To wrap up the chapter, I give you a look at other ways to add areas 
of color to your images, including the very useful Gradient tool.

294     PART 3  Creating “Art” in Photoshop
Discovering Photoshop’s Painting Tools
Nothing in Photoshop gives you more precise control of color in your image than 
using the Pencil tool with a 1-pixel brush. Remember that your image consists of 
a whole lot of little colored squares (pixels) and that the color of those individual 
squares is what produces the appearance of a tree or a sunset or even good ol’ 
Uncle Bob. If you zoom in really close on an image, you can paint pixel by pixel — 
you could even create an entire image, one pixel at a time! You are, however, much 
more likely to use the Brush tool with a much larger brush tip to add strokes of 
color, rather than working one pixel at a time.
As you work in Photoshop, you’ll also find many very important roles for the 
brush-using tools other than painting imagery. From touching up dust and 
scratches in a scan to removing distant power lines from a photo to perhaps add-
ing wispy hairs to soften the outline of a head, you have lots of reasons to paint in 
Photoshop (many of which you can read about in Chapters 9 and 10). When you’re 
capable and confident using the Brush tool, you might even find it the best way 
to make selections in your image. Selections with the Brush tool? That’s right — 
painting in an alpha channel creates or refines a saved selection. (You can read 
about alpha channels in Chapter 8.) Photoshop even has a brush-using tool that 
you can use to make selections directly. The Quick Selection tool, like the Magic 
Wand, selects areas of similar color. However, instead of Shift+clicking in a variety 
of areas with the Magic Wand to add to your initial selection, you simply drag the 
Quick Selection tool. The brush diameter, selected on the Options bar, tells Photo-
shop the size of the area you want to search for similarly colored pixels.
In addition to the Quick Selection tool, you have 19 other tools that use brushes 
available in Photoshop. Here’s a quick look at the various capabilities of those tools:
»
» Painting tools: The Brush, Pencil, and Mixer Brush tools (all discussed a bit 
later and in more depth) add the selected foreground color to the active layer 
as you click or drag the tool.
»
» Eraser tools: These tools (also discussed in more depth in pages to come) can 
make areas of a layer transparent or can paint over pixels with the current 
background color (if the layer doesn’t support transparency).
»
» Healing tools: The Spot Healing Brush and Healing Brush are designed to 
repair texture, like smoothing wrinkles or adding the appearance of canvas. 
With the Healing Brush, you first designate a source point — an area from 
which you want to copy texture — by Option/Alt+clicking and you then drag 
the brush over the area targeted for repair. The Spot Healing Brush, on the 
other hand, automatically samples the texture around an area and makes the 
target area match its surroundings. With the Content-Aware option, this tool 
can better match the healed area to the surrounding image. Quite cool!

CHAPTER 14  Painting in Photoshop     295
»
» Color Replacement tool: Nested with the Brush and Pencil, the Color 
Replacement tool replaces the color over which you drag with the foreground 
color. Remember that, by default, the Color Replacement tool alters only the 
color, not luminosity, so painting with black over pink gives you gray rather 
than black. From the Options bar, you can set the tool to change luminosity 
rather than color to darken or lighten, or choose to match hue or saturation.
»
» Stamp tools: The Clone Stamp tool, unlike the Color Replacement tool or the 
Healing Brush, doesn’t copy an attribute (such as color or texture), but actually 
copies pixels. It’s like having copy/paste in a brush. Option/Alt+click a source 
area and then move the cursor and drag where you want to copy those pixels. 
It’s powerful! The Pattern Stamp tool paints with a selected pattern, using the 
blending mode and opacity that you designate on the Options bar. The 
Pattern Stamp tool is sometimes a good way to add texture selectively.
When working with the Clone Stamp tool and the Clone Source panel, you can 
specify and move between up to five different source points. You also have 
the option of showing an overlay, which lets you see in advance what dragging 
the tool will do to your artwork.
»
» History brushes: The History Brush, discussed in Chapter 1, allows you to 
paint areas of the image to restore them to a previous state in the develop-
ment process. Nested with the History Brush, the Art History Brush uses the 
history state selected in the History panel to add an Impressionist look where 
you paint.
»
» Focus tools: The Blur and Sharpen tools do just what their names say, but 
you’ll likely find the default 50% Strength to be way too powerful (Sharpen) or 
way too weak (Blur) for most jobs. Selective sharpening can help bring out 
details and direct attention in an image. Likewise, selective blurring can hide 
minor defects and help direct the viewer’s eye toward areas of sharpness in 
the image. If you have avoided the Sharpen tool in the past, give it another 
chance using the Protect Detail option.
Tucked in with the focus tools is the Smudge tool. Click and drag to smear 
pixels along the path. (I find the Smudge tool especially useful for dragging out 
wispy hairs from heads that appear perhaps too well defined and smooth.)
»
» Toning tools: The Dodge tool lightens, the Burn tool darkens — and if you use 
the defaults, they do it too much! When using these tools to adjust luminosity 
in your image, it’s best to start with an Exposure setting of about 15% and 
paint carefully, perhaps repeatedly, rather than making a huge change with 
Exposure set to 50%.
The Sponge tool is nested with the Dodge and Burn tools. Use it to either 
increase or decrease saturation as you drag. (Decreasing saturation with the 
Sponge tool is a great way to create an image that’s partially grayscale.)

296     PART 3  Creating “Art” in Photoshop
The Healing Brush and the Clone Stamp have a button to the right of the Sample 
menu on the Options bar. When the Sample pop-up menu is set to All Layers or 
the Current & Below option, that button gives you the option of ignoring adjust-
ment layers. You might want to use this option if, for example, you’re cloning or 
healing from multiple layers below an adjustment layer to a new layer that itself 
would be affected by the adjustment layer. This prevents the adjustment from 
being applied twice.
Painting with the Brush tool
You control where the Brush tool works by selecting a brush tip of a particu-
lar size, shape, and hardness (the fuzziness, or lack thereof, along the edges of 
a round brush tip). Remember, too, that you can use the Brush and other paint-
ing tools to create subtle changes in existing colors. By selecting an appropriate 
blending mode and opacity, you can mix the painting color into the existing colors 
in your image. Make these basic decisions from the Options bar, shown for the 
Brush tool in Figure 14-1.
As you see in Figure 14-1, the Options bar gives you access to a miniature Brush 
Settings panel (click the arrow to the right of the brush size) from which you can 
pick a brush tip, change its size, orientation, roundness (some brush tips), and 
adjust the hardness of the brush’s edges. (Only round brush tips use the Hardness 
adjustment on the Options bar.) You also have a handy button just to the right 
of the arrow button to toggle the visibility of the full Brush panel on the Options 
bar. The five sample lines to the right show Hardness, from 0% to 100% in 25% 
increments, all using a 40-pixel brush. The Brush tool can use any brush tip that 
you have in the Brush panel — and, as you can read later in this chapter, you can 
customize the brush tip in a variety of ways.
FIGURE 14-1: 
Make the pri-
mary decisions 
about painting

ior from the 
Options bar.

CHAPTER 14  Painting in Photoshop     297
You’re actually ready to paint in Photoshop already! Select a foreground color, 
select the brush size that you want, decide how hard or fuzzy the edges should 
be, change the blending mode and opacity (if desired), and drag the tool in your 
image. (And, perhaps best of all, no turpentine needed for cleaning up — just 
switch tools in the Toolbox.)
As you work with the brush-using tools, always remember that the selected 
brush tip is applied as a series of individual impressions, called instances. Consider 
an instance to be a single impression of the brush tip, like tapping a pen once  
on a piece of paper — it leaves a single dot. Take a look at the outer borders in 
Figure 14-2. Changing the brush tip’s Spacing value in the Brush Settings panel 
shows how instances appear. In the upper left, the spacing is set to the default 
25% and a continuous line results. To the upper right, Spacing is set to 67%, and 
the individual brush tip instances are visible as overlapping circles. To the lower 
left, Spacing is set to 133% — this is a setting that you might use for a dotted or 
dashed line — and each brush tip instance is visible individually.
If you know you have the cursor set to show the brush tip, but you’re seeing the 
tiny little crosshairs instead, check the Caps Lock key on your keyboard. Caps Lock 
toggles between precise and brush-size cursors for the brush-using tools. (During 
the discussion of Photoshop’s Preferences in Chapter 3, I showed a comparison of 
the three brush cursor options in Figure 3-11.)
FIGURE 14-2: 
Changing the 
Spacing makes

brush tip

298     PART 3  Creating “Art” in Photoshop
When you change the Brush tool’s Opacity setting on the Options bar, you change 
the appearance of the stroke as a whole. Changing the Flow setting (also on the 
Options bar), on the other hand, changes the amount of color applied with each 
instance of the brush tip. When the flow is reduced and the spacing is set to less 
than 100%, the overlapping area of each brush instance appears darker (or lighter 
when painting with, for example, white on black). To the right of the Flow field 
is the Airbrush button. When the Air-
brush is on (the button turns dark), the 
Flow value takes on more meaning. As 
you paint with the Brush in Airbrush 
mode with a reduced Flow setting, 
pausing the cursor with the mouse 
button down allows color to build up 
(become more opaque) as if you were 
using a real airbrush. You can use the 
Airbrush both as a traditional airbrush 
artist and to simulate spray paint. You 
can see both in Figure 14-3.
To the right of the Airbrush button you find the new Smoothing field and the 
related gear button to control smoothing options. When painting curved strokes, 
the Smoothing option helps keep the stroke from becoming too sharp as you 
change directions. Depending on your input device and the amount of smoothing 
you’ve selected, you may see a slight delay on-screen as you paint. You also have 
a Smoothing pane in the Brush Settings panel (discussed in the “Working with 
Panels and Selecting Colors” section).
With a video card that supports OpenCL drawing, you can rotate the image on-
screen for easier painting  — not rotate the canvas, but rotate the on-screen 
image! This can be great for fine-tuning a layer mask or doing other delicate 
painting tasks. Using the Rotate View tool (nested with the Hand tool) permits you 
to arrange the artwork for your most comfortable painting stroke. While dragging 
the Rotate View tool, an on-screen compass’s red arrow always orients you to 
the top of the image. When you want the image oriented back to the top, simply 
double-click the Rotate View tool icon in the Tools panel.
Adding color with the Pencil tool
The Pencil tool differs from the Brush tool in one major respect: Regard-
less of the Hardness setting in the Brush panel, the Pencil tool always uses a 
hardness value of 100%. With the Pencil tool active, the Options bar offers the 
miniature Brush panel, a choice of blending mode and opacity, and the somewhat- 
misnamed Auto Erase option. When selected, Auto Erase lets you paint over areas 
FIGURE 14-3: 
Airbrushing and spray painting with the Airbrush 
option for the Brush tool.

CHAPTER 14  Painting in Photoshop     299
of the current foreground color using the current background color. Click an area 
of the foreground color, and the Pencil applies the background color. Click any 
color other than the foreground color, and the Pencil applies the foreground color. 
But remember, you’re not erasing, just painting with the background color (even 
on layers with transparency).
Removing color with the Eraser tool
The fourth of your primary painting tools is the Eraser. On a layer that supports 
transparency, the Eraser tool makes the pixels transparent. On a layer named 
Background, the Eraser paints with the background color. On the Options bar, the 
Eraser tool’s Mode menu doesn’t offer blending modes, but rather three behavior 
choices. When you select Brush (the default), the Options bar offers you the same 
Opacity, Flow, and Airbrush options as the Brush tool. You can also select Pencil, 
which offers an Opacity slider, but no Flow or Airbrush option (comparable to the 
actual Pencil tool). When Mode is set to Block, you have a square Eraser tool that 
erases at the size of the cursor. (When you click or drag, the number of pixels 
erased is tied to the current zoom factor.) Regardless of which mode is selected, 
the Options bar offers one more important choice: To the right of the Smoothing 
field’s gear button, you find the Erase to History check box. When selected, the 
Eraser tool paints over the pixels like the History Brush, restoring the pixels to 
their appearance at the selected state in the History panel.
A couple of variations on the Eraser tool are tucked away with it in the Toolbox, 
too. The Background Eraser tool can, in fact, be used to remove a background from 
your image. However, it’s not limited to something in your image that appears to 
be a background. Remember that digital images don’t really have backgrounds 
and foregrounds or subjects — they just have collections of tiny, colored squares. 
What does this mean for using the Background Eraser? You can click and drag on 
any color in the image to erase areas of that color. You can also elect to erase only 
the current background color and designate the foreground color as protected so 
that it won’t be erased even if you drag over it.
The Magic Eraser, like the Magic Wand selection tool (see Chapter  8), isn’t a 
brush-using tool, but this is a logical place to tell you about it. Click a color with 
the Magic Eraser tool, and that color is erased, either in a contiguous area or 
throughout the image, depending on whether you have selected the Contiguous 
option on the Options bar. And, like the Magic Wand, on the Options bar you can 
set the tool to work on the active layer or all layers, and you can also set a specific 
level of sensitivity (Tolerance). Here is the one difference between the two: The 
Magic Eraser is, in fact, a painting tool in that you can set an opacity percentage, 
which partially erases the selected pixels.

300     PART 3  Creating “Art” in Photoshop
Working with Panels and Selecting Colors
To select and customize brush tips, Photoshop offers the Brush Settings and the 
Brush panels (both shown in Figure 14-4). Select a brush tip in the Brush Settings 
panel (or in the Brush panel or on the Options bar), and then customize it to do 
your bidding using the options in the Brush panel.
The Brush panel’s menu includes the New Brush Group command. If you often use 
certain brushes together and want to streamline the Brush panel to make those 
brushes more easily located, select the brush tips and create a group. Expand and 
collapse groups in the panel as desired.
You must have a brush-using tool active to access the Brush Settings panel. If the 
active tool doesn’t use brushes, the entire panel is grayed out and unavailable. 
However, regardless of what tool is active, clicking a brush preset in the Brush 
panel automatically switches you to the Brush tool.
An overview of options
The Brush Settings panel, like the Layer Style dialog box, has a column on the 
left that lists options. Like the Layer Style dialog box, you mark the check box to 
activate the feature, but you have to click the name to open that pane in the panel. 
As you can see in Figure  14-4, the Brush Settings panel menu offers very few 
commands, whereas the Brush panel menu includes variations in how to display 
the panel content, some housekeeping commands for resetting/loading/saving 
brushes, and a list of brush sets in the bottom half of the menu.
FIGURE 14-4: 
The Brush 
and Brush 
Presets panels, 
with their 
panel menus, 
provide lots of 
options.

CHAPTER 14  Painting in Photoshop     301
Don’t overlook those little lock icons to the right of the various pane names in 
the Brush Settings panel. Click the lock to preserve the settings in that pane while 
you switch among brush tip presets. Any unlocked attributes revert to those with 
which the brush tip was created. Locking, for example, Shape Dynamics retains 
those settings even if you switch to a totally different brush tip.
Here, in order, are the Brush panel panes and the options in those panes to which 
you should pay attention:
»
» Brushes: This button (just above the names of the panes) opens the Brush 
panel, where you pick the basic brush tip shape from the brushes loaded in 
the panel. You can also resize the brush tip, but that’s it. (Note that you can 
also select a brush tip in the Brush Tip Shape panel of the Brush 
Settings panel.)
»
» Brush Tip Shape: Without a check box to the left or a lock icon to the right, 
Brush Tip Shape is the pane in which you can select and customize a brush 
tip. (Refer to the Brush Tip Shape pane in Figure 14-4.) This is perhaps the 
most important part of the Brush panel. In this pane, you can select a brush 
tip, change its size, alter the angle at which it’s applied, change the height-
width relationship (Roundness) of the tip, and adjust the Spacing setting.
»
» Shape Dynamics: Dynamics in the Brush panel add variation as you drag a 
tool. Say you’re working with a round brush tip and choose Size Jitter. As you 
drag the brush tip, the brush tip instances (the individual marks left by the 
brush as you drag) will vary in diameter. The Shape Dynamics pane offers Size 
Jitter, Angle Jitter, and Roundness Jitter. Each of the “jitters” can be set to fade 
after a certain number of brush tip instances or can be controlled with the 
stylus that you use with a Wacom tablet. Angle can also be set to Direction, 
which forces the brush tip to adjust the direction that you drag or the 
direction of the selection or path you stroke. Use Shape Dynamics to add 
some variation and randomness to your painting, as shown in Figure 14-5.
»
» Scattering: Scattering varies the number of brush tip instances as you drag as 
well as their placement along the path you drag. Like Shape Dynamics, 
Scattering can be set to fade or can be controlled with a Wacom tablet.
»
» Texture: Use the Texture pane to add a pattern to the brush tip, as shown in 
Figure 14-5. You can select from among the same patterns that you use to fill 
a selection. Texture is most evident when Spacing is set to at least 50%.
»
» Dual Brush: Using a blending mode you select, the Dual Brush option 
overlays a second brush tip. You could, for example, add an irregular scatter 
brush to a round brush tip to break up the outline as you paint.

302     PART 3  Creating “Art” in Photoshop
»
» Color Dynamics: Using the Color Dynamics pane, you can vary the color of 
your stroke as you drag. This comes in most handy for painting images and 
scenes rather than, say, working on an alpha channel. Just as you might add 
jitter to the size, shape, and placement of a grass brush while creating a 
meadow, you might also want to add some differences in color as you drag. 
You could pick different shades of green for the foreground and background 
colors and then also add jitter to the hue, saturation, and brightness values as 
the foreground and background colors are mixed while you drag. (See the 
greenery in Figure 14-5.)
»
» Transfer: Think of this pane as Opacity and Flow Jitter. You can add variation 
to the opacity and flow settings from the Options bar to change the way paint 
“builds up” in your artwork.
»
» Brush Pose: When working with a Wacom tablet (see Chapter 19), this panel 
enables you to ensure precision by overriding certain stylus-controlled 
variations in a stroke. If, for example, you want to ensure that the brush tip size 
doesn’t change, regardless of how hard you press on the tablet, open Brush 
Pose, set Pressure to 100%, and select the Override Pressure check box. You 
can also override the stylus’s rotation and tilt as you paint, setting any value 
from –100 to +100 for both tilt axis values and 0 to 360 degrees for rotation.
»
» Other Options: At the bottom of the left column are five brush options that 
don’t have separate panes in the Brush panel. They’re take-it-or-leave-it 
options — either activated or not.
•	 Noise: Adding Noise to the brush stroke helps produce some texture and 
breaks up solid areas of color in your stroke.

­application of

brush tip.

CHAPTER 14  Painting in Photoshop     303
•	 Wet Edges: Wet Edges simulates paint building up along the edges of your 
stroke.
•	 Build-up: The Build-up check box simply activates the Airbrush button on 
the Options bar.
•	 Smoothing: Smoothing helps reduce sharp angles as you drag your mouse 
or stylus. If the stroke you’re painting should indeed have jagged turns and 
angles, disable Smoothing.
•	 Protect Texture: The Protect Texture option ensures that all the brushes 
with a defined texture use the same texture. Use this option when you 
want to simulate painting on canvas, for example.
When creating a dashed line or stroking a path with a nonround brush tip, go to 
the Shape Dynamics pane of the Brush panel and set the Angle Jitter’s Control 
pop-up menu to Direction. That enables the brush tip to rotate as necessary to 
follow the twists and turns of the selection or path that it’s stroking. (You’ll gen-
erally want to leave Angle Jitter set to 0% so that the stroke follows the selection 
or path precisely.)
Creating and saving custom brush tips
You can use any artwork as a custom brush tip. With the artwork on a trans-
parent or white background (you don’t even need to make a selection), choose 
Edit ➪ Define Brush Preset, type a name, and click OK. Your new custom brush is 
added to the Brush panel. After you define a piece of artwork as a brush, you can 
add that image to any project with a single click or drag.
Remember that a brush tip is always grayscale, regardless of the color in the art-
work from which it was defined, and that it will be used to apply the foreground 
color. Also keep in mind that the maximum size for a brush tip is 5,000 pixels in 
either dimension.
Picking a color
If you want to apply a specific color to your image with a painting tool, you have to 
be able to select that color, right? Photoshop provides you with a number of ways 
to select a color:
»
» Click a saved color swatch in the Swatches panel.
»
» Enter numeric values or drag sliders in the Color panel.

304     PART 3  Creating “Art” in Photoshop
»
» Click a color swatch at the bottom of the Toolbox, on the Options bar, or 
in the Color panel to open the Color Picker.
»
» Select a sample size and specify which layers to sample on the Options 
bar. When set to Point Size (the default), the eyedropper samples only the one 
pixel directly under the cursor. You can set the Eyedropper to set the fore-
ground color to an average of a 3x3 sample to avoid having one stray pixel 
misrepresent the area of the image you want to sample. The sample size 
average can be as large as 101x101 pixels. (Remember, too, that you can 
right-click with the Eyedropper to change the sample size without having to 
visit the Options bar.)
»
» Specify which layers to sample on the Options bar. When working with 
layered documents, the Eyedropper offers a number of sampling options. You 
can elect to pick up the color on the currently active layer, the active layer and 
the layer immediately below it in the Layers panel, all layers, all layers except 
adjustment layers, and the current layer and the next pixel layer below 
(ignoring any adjustment layers in between).
The Eyedropper’s Options bar offers the Show Sampling Ring option. When active 
and the Eyedropper is in use, the Sampling Ring is a pair of concentric circles (as 
shown to the upper-right in Figure 14-6). The outer ring is neutral gray to isolate 
the inner ring from surrounding colors. The bottom half of the inner ring shows 
the current foreground color, whereas the top half shows the color over which you 
have dragged the cursor. If you find it distracting, disable it on the Options bar.

Picker to define

CHAPTER 14  Painting in Photoshop     305
In both the Toolbox and the Color panel, the foreground color is shown in the 
swatch to the upper left, and the background swatch is partially hidden behind it. 
Swap the foreground and background colors by pressing the X key on your key-
board. Reset them to the default black and white by pressing the D key.
In Chapter 6, I introduce the Color panel and the various ways you can define color 
with it. Now take a look at the Color panel’s big brother, the Color Picker. (See 
Figure  14-6.) (If, in Preferences ➪ General, you have elected to use the system 
color picker rather than the Adobe version, your color picker will differ.) Note the 
reminder in the title bar of the Color Picker window that tells you whether you’re 
changing the foreground or background color. (If you find that you’re changing 
the background color when you want to change the foreground color, exit the 
Color Picker, open the Color panel, and click the foreground swatch.) The best way 
to get a feel for the incredible versatility of the Color Picker is to open it (click a 
color swatch at the bottom of the Toolbox or in the Color panel) and click each of 
the buttons to the left of the numeric fields. Each option changes how the Color 
Picker appears as well as how it defines color.
The default Color Picker configuration uses the radio button to the left of the H 
(Hue) field. It presents you with a vertical rainbow slider (the hue) and a square 
area that defines saturation (left-right) and brightness (up-down). Click or drag 
in the square area to the left and drag the slider up and down to pick a color. 
(Compare the two swatches to the left of the Cancel button to see the new color 
above the previously selected color.) If you click the button to the left of the S field, 
the slider shows saturation, and hue and brightness are defined in the square area 
to the left. Starting to see the pattern? Check out the configuration for Brightness 
(B) as well as the RGB and Lab options. And note that you can type numeric values 
to define a color as CMYK, but there are no buttons to the left to reconfigure the 
Color Picker. Likewise, you can type in the # (hexadecimal) field below the B field, 
but you can’t use it to reconfigure the Color Picker. (Hexadecimal color definition 
is used with HyperText Markup Language [HTML] code in web pages.)
Between the two color swatches in the top center and the buttons to the right are 
a pair of little icons that aren’t always visible. (Check them out in Figure 14-6 if 
they’re not currently showing in your own Color Picker.) The top warning triangle 
tells you that the current color can’t be reproduced within your working CMYK 
color profile. Unless you’re preparing artwork for commercial offset press, ignore 
it — it has nothing to do with your inkjet printer, for example. If, on the other 
hand, you are working on a press-destined project, click the swatch just below the 
warning triangle to jump to the nearest reproducible color.
The lower icon, a little cube symbol, lets you know that your current color isn’t 
web-safe. Web-safe colors are the couple hundred colors that are exactly the same 
in the base color scheme for both Mac and Windows. If visitors to your website 

306     PART 3  Creating “Art” in Photoshop
have their monitors — or other devices — set to show only 256 colors, everyone 
sees the same thing with web-safe colors. Generally, you can safely ignore the 
warning because the variation isn’t worth worrying about. (If you do want to work 
with web-safe colors, click the swatch below the warning cube icon and then 
select the Only Web Colors check box in the lower-left corner.)
After you define a custom color with the numeric fields or by clicking in the sam-
ple colors to the left, you can easily save the color to the Swatches panel by click-
ing the Add to Swatches button. Should you need to reselect that specific color 
later, or even when working on another image, it’s right there in the Swatches 
panel, exactly as originally defined.
Also note the Color Libraries button. Clicking that button swaps the Color Picker 
for the Color Libraries dialog box, in which you can select spot colors. Spot col-
ors, which I explain in Chapter 6, are special premixed inks that can be specially 
requested when preparing a job for a commercial printing press. Adding a spot 
color ensures that the color will appear in the final product exactly as expected. 
However, because they generally require an extra pass through a press, adding 
spot colors increases the cost of your printing. (Remember that if you want the 
color to print as a spot color, you don’t paint with it, but rather create a spot chan-
nel to identify where the spot color appears in your artwork.) Spot colors can be 
used to define colors for nonpress jobs, but the color is converted to your working 
color mode and printed with a mixture of your regular inks. Return to the Color 
Picker from Color Libraries by clicking the Picker button.
Fine Art Painting with Specialty  
Brush Tips and the Mixer Brush
Traditionally trained artists have a whole load of options available when using the 
Brush tool. Depending on what sort of brush tip is selected in the Brush Preset or 
Brush panel, the Brush panel itself changes configuration. Check out the erodible 
brush tips which, like the pastel and charcoal sticks they represent, actually wear 
down as you use them! The profile of the tip changes as you work. You’ll also find 
airbrush and watercolor brush tips with such Brush panel options as Distortion, 
Granularity, Spatter Size, and Spatter Amount.
As you start to explore these brush tips and their capabilities, I suggest that you 
open the Brush Presets panel menu and switch the view to Large (or Small) List. 
The thumbnails will still be visible, but the actual names of the brush tips will 
give you more insight into how each behaves before you select one. Brush tip 
names with the words Stiff or Bristle are designed for use with the Mixer Brush 
(discussed later in this section).

CHAPTER 14  Painting in Photoshop     307
Exploring erodible brush tips
Brush tips with names such as Square Pastel, Charcoal Pencil, and Round Water-
color are erodible tips. Options in the Brush panel for erodible brush tips are 
shown in the middle panel in Figure 14-7.
For erodible tips, Size is the brush size before it starts to wear down. The Softness 
determines how quickly the tip erodes, with zero being the softest and a setting of 
100% maintaining the brush tip — no eroding. Preset erodible brush shapes avail-
able include point, flat, round, square, and triangle. The Sharpen button resets the 
brush tip to its default shape.
Introducing airbrush and watercolor tips
Airbrush and watercolor brush tips, with names such as Watercolor Build Up, 
Watercolor Wash, Airbrush Soft Low Density Grainy, and Watercolor Spat-
ter Big Drops, use the options shown in the Brush Settings panel to the right in 
Figure 14-7.
When working with an airbrush or watercolor tip, the options in the Brush panel 
include Hardness (think of it as the density of the spray), Distortion (the amount 
of overspray or spread), Granularity (fine spray or speckles or color), Spatter Size 
(the size of the droplets), and Spatter Amount (the number of droplets).
Keep in mind that selecting an airbrush brush tip does not activate the Airbrush 
option on the Options bar. If you want to combine an airbrush tip with airbrush 
action (so that color builds up when you pause the cursor), click the Airbrush but-
ton on the Options bar.
Think about pixel dimensions before selecting these tips — the maximum work-
ing area for these tips is about 100 pixels in diameter. You may find times when, 
to achieve your artistic vision, you need to open a separate document at smaller 
dimensions, paint in that image, and then use Image Size to scale before copying 
into your working document. Alternatively, work on a small document, save it, 
and then use the Place command to add it to your working document as a Smart 
Object.
Chapter 19 is titled “Ten Reasons to Love Your Wacom Tablet.” That chapter is 
oriented toward general Photoshop users, for the most part. If you’re an art-
ist, these brush tips are more than enough justification to start tablet (or Cintiq) 
shopping! A mouse or trackpad just can’t take advantage of all the new, powerful, 
artistically liberating painting features. Tablets take advantage of not only pen 
pressure, but also angle and rotation, enabling you to control the shape of the tip 
as you work with it.

308     PART 3  Creating “Art” in Photoshop
Mixing things up with the Mixer Brush
The Mixer Brush, nested in the Toolbox with the Brush tool, is designed to give 
traditionally trained artists a more familiar feel. Also best used with a Wacom 
tablet or Cintiq and a stylus, this tool takes painting several steps forward. The 
bristle tips available for the Mixer Brush are designed to work more like the physi-
cal brushes used to add physical paint to physical canvas, but in a digital sort of 
way. (The bristle tips can be used with other painting tools, but they pretty much 
behave like the static tips, the brush tips normally used with the other tools.)
The Mixer Brush can apply the foreground color interactively with pixels already 
on the active layer. Using a “wet” brush (selected on the Options bar) liquefies or 
melts the existing colors on the layer, pulling them along (with the foreground 
color) as you drag the tool. To minimize interaction with existing colors, use 
a “dry” brush or add a layer and paint on the new layer. For a comparison of 
brushes using the wet (upper stroke) and dry (lower stroke) options, as well as a 
look at the Mixer Brush Options bar and the Brush Presets panel, see Figure 14-8.
Some options for the Mixer Brush (going from the upper left in Figure  14-8) 
deserve explanation:
»
» To the right of the standard tool preset and mini-Brush panel, the color 
swatch represents the current brush load, the paint on the brush. Clicking the 
swatch opens the Color Picker; clicking the triangle to the right of the swatch 
provides an easy way to clean the brush (so that it interacts only with existing 
colors on the layer) or to reload the brush (add color to the mix).
FIGURE 14-7:

airbrush, and

capabilities.

CHAPTER 14  Painting in Photoshop     309
»
» The two buttons to the right of the color swatch can be used to automatically 
reload the tool after each stroke and to automatically clean the brush after 
each stroke. The two buttons can be used together.
»
» The pop-up menu to the right of the Auto-Load and Auto-Clean buttons 
provides a list of dry, moist, wet, and very wet presets from which to choose.
»
» The Wet field controls how the brush interacts with color already on the layer. 
The wetter the brush, the more it picks up color (and blends with the current 
brush load) on the layer. A low value overlays the load color without mixing in 
the existing colors.
»
» The Load field controls how much “paint” is added to the brush. With a low 
value, the color runs out quickly and strokes are short. With a high value, the 
strokes continue to add color. The load settings are most apparent when 
using a dry brush.
»
» The Mix field also contributes to how the load color and existing color on the 
layer interact. A low value uses lots of the load color, whereas a high value 
uses more of the color already on the layer. Mix isn’t used with dry brushes 
(because they don’t interact with the existing colors).
»
» The Flow field is yet another variable for the amount of color added by the 
Mixer Brush. Low values result in a more transparent stroke, whereas very 
high values produce opaque strokes (which tend to be shorter because the 
brush, you might say, “runs out of paint”).

310     PART 3  Creating “Art” in Photoshop
The Mixer Brush can also interact with strokes applied by the Brush and Pencil 
tools. And as you fine-tune your masterpiece, remember that you can push this 
paint around with the Smudge tool and use the Blur, Sharpen, Dodge, Burn, and 
Sponge tools, too. Sometime when you need a break, open a new empty docu-
ment, select the Mixer Brush, and explore your inner Rembrandt (or Salvador 
Dali, perhaps).
Don’t forget about the Oil Paint filter in Photoshop’s Filter — Stylize menu. You’ll 
find information about using it in Chapter 15.
Filling, Stroking, Dumping,  
and Blending Colors
You have several more ways to add color to your artwork, none of which use 
brushes at all. You can, for example, make a selection and fill the selection with 
color by choosing Edit ➪ Fill, or you can add a band of color along the edge of the 
selection by choosing Edit ➪ Stroke (using the dialog boxes shown to the right in 
Figure 14-9).
Deleting and dumping to add color
The first time you press the Delete/Backspace key, the keystroke opens the Fill dia-
log box. The Content-Aware option is sort of a “smart fill.” The area surrounding 
FIGURE 14-9: 
Photoshop 
offers several 
non-brush 
ways to add 
color to your 
images.

CHAPTER 14  Painting in Photoshop     311
the current selection is analyzed and Photoshop fills to match that surrounding 
area as seamlessly as possible. If you simply want to delete to the current back-
ground color, hold down the ⌘  /Ctrl key and press Delete/Backspace. You can also 
fill with the current foreground color by using Option/Alt with Delete/Backspace.
You can also “dump” color into your image with the Paint Bucket tool, nested 
below the Gradient tool in the Toolbox. Use the Paint Bucket tool to fill an empty 
selection with color or to replace the color on which you click with the foreground 
color. Don’t forget vector shapes, either! They’re a great way to add perfectly 
defined areas of solid color to an image. (You can read about working with shapes 
in Chapter 11.)
Using gradients
You can add gradients, which are subtle blends of color, quite easily to your art-
work. Follow these steps:
1.	 Make a selection.
Unless you make a selection first, the gradient fills your entire layer. If you want 
the gradient to fill the entire layer, don’t make a selection first.
2.	 Select the Gradient tool.
Click the Gradient tool in the Toolbox. If you don’t see it, look for it nested with 
the Paint Bucket tool.
3.	 Select a gradient.
You can open the Gradient panel by clicking the triangle to the right of the 
sample gradient on the Options bar. (See Figure 14-10.) You can also click the 
sample gradient on the Options bar to open the Gradient Editor.
4.	 Choose a shape.
The five buttons to the right of the sample gradient on the Options bar show 
the shapes available for the Gradient tool. (From the left, the buttons are 
Linear, Radial, Angle, Reflected, and Diamond.)
5.	 Choose additional options.
You can pick a blending mode and opacity, flip the colors in the gradient with 
the Reverse option, choose Dither to help disguise the transitions between 
colors, and select the Transparency option to preserve any transparency 
defined in the gradient.
6.	 Drag the Gradient tool.
Where you start and in which direction you drag ultimately determine the 
appearance of the gradient.

312     PART 3  Creating “Art” in Photoshop
The background gradient in Figure 14-10 uses the Angle Gradient option on the 
Options bar and the gradient that you see in the Gradient Editor. Notice in the 
Gradient Editor the Opacity stops (above the sample being edited) and Color stops 
(below the sample). The stops  — the squares with points positioned along the 
sample gradient — determine the color or opacity of the gradient at that particu-
lar point. By default, there’s a smooth and even blend between neighboring stops, 
but you can adjust the blend by dragging the small diamonds you see on either 
side of the opacity and color stops. (Hint: The active stops use filled triangles 
instead of hollow triangles with their little squares.)
Click anywhere along the top (opacity) or bottom (color) of the gradient to add a 
new stop. Drag stops to move them. Option/Alt+drag a stop to duplicate it. Change 
the attributes of the selected stop with the options just below in the Gradient 
Editor.
After designing your new gradient, remember to click the New button to add it 
to the Gradient panel. But keep in mind that custom gradients aren’t really saved 
until you use the Save button or the Preset Manager to create sets on your hard 
drive. If you don’t save your custom gradients, they’ll be gone if you need to reset 
Photoshop’s Preferences file. (See Chapter 3 for more on saving presets.)

CHAPTER 15  Filters: The Fun Side of Photoshop     313
Filters: The Fun Side 
of Photoshop
T
he Photoshop Filter menu includes some 75 commands that you can use 
to fix, flatter, finesse, and freak out your photos. Open the Filter Gallery to 
access almost 50 additional filters. You can use most of the filters on most 
of your artwork and some of the filters on some of your artwork, and you probably 
won’t ever use quite a few of the filters.
In this chapter, I start you off with a discussion of the Smart Filters feature, 
something you should get used to using just about every time you apply a filter. 
Next, you get a look at what I call the “production” filters, the key filters you use 
to improve or repair your images, including the improved filters for sharpen-
ing and the capability to use Camera Raw as a filter on any image, on any layer. 
(See Chapter 7 for information on working with Camera Raw.) Following that, I 
show you the basics of two of the most fun features in all of Photoshop: the Filter  
Gallery and Liquify. Not only are they fun, but you can also use them to do won-
drous things to your artwork. I wrap up the chapter with a look at several other 
key filters.

314     PART 3  Creating “Art” in Photoshop
Smart Filters: Your Creative  
Insurance Policy
One of the most important concepts to keep in mind when working with filters is 
Smart Filters. When you apply a filter to a pixel layer, that’s it — the pixels are 
changed. But, when you apply a filter to a Smart Object, you create a Smart Filter. 
With Smart Filters, you can apply one or more filters to a Smart Object and later 
change your mind about what settings — or even what filters — to use, without 
reverting to a saved copy of the file or using the History panel. Unlike adjustment 
layers, which are, in fact, separate layers in the image, Smart Filters work more 
like layer styles. They appear in the Layers panel below the layer to which they’re 
applied and can be shown or hidden by clicking an eyeball icon. (See Figure 15-1.) 
And, like layer styles, you can reopen a Smart Filter by double-clicking it in the 
Layers panel.
The active layer (highlighted in the Layers panel) has both layer effects and Smart 
Filters applied. (Refer to Figure 15-1.) The type layer above has only layer effects, 
whereas the other two Smart Objects, below in the Layers panel, have Smart Fil-
ters but no layer effects. Clicking the triangle to the far right of a layer name 
expands and collapses the list of effects and filters applied. Clicking the eyeball 
icon to the left of an item hides it without removing it. You can delete a Smart 
Filter by dragging it to the Trash icon (just as you can with layer effects), which 
removes its effect from the Smart Object. To reopen a filter’s dialog box to change 
settings, simply double-click the filter name in the Layers panel.
FIGURE 15-1: 
Smart Filters 
are more  
like layer  
styles than 
adjustment 
layers.

CHAPTER 15  Filters: The Fun Side of Photoshop     315
Smart Filters can be applied only to Smart Objects (which are discussed in 
­Chapter 10). Luckily, you can convert any pixel-based layer, even a background 
layer, to a Smart Object simply by selecting that layer in the Layers panel and 
choosing Layer ➪ Smart Objects ➪ Convert to Smart Object. You can even select 
multiple layers in the Layers panel and create a single Smart Object with that 
command. You can then apply a Smart Filter to all of the layers in the Smart 
Object. If you later need to alter the content of the Smart Object itself, double-
click it in the Layers panel. The Smart Object’s contents opens in a separate image 
window. After making the necessary changes, use the Save command (not Save 
As) and then close the window. The Smart Object will be updated in your artwork 
and any Smart Filters will be reapplied.
Because you can easily remove or change Smart Filters, they provide you with a 
special sort of creative license: the license to experiment and change your mind 
(or make changes that your boss wants). Because they are nondestructive (they 
don’t make permanent changes to the pixels in your image), you can use Smart 
Filters without fear of damaging your image. Of course that doesn’t mean you 
shouldn’t work on a copy of your beautiful photo — it’s always better to safeguard 
the original image file and work on a duplicate.
The Filters You Really Need
Photoshop has several filters that you can use on just about any image to improve 
or finesse it. Most photos, for example, benefit from at least a little bit of sharp-
ening to improve the detail in the image. In some cases, you want to decrease the 
visible detail in an image in some areas to hide defects, or perhaps you want to 
blur a background to draw more attention to the subject of your shot. And Pho-
toshop has a couple of filters that you’ll find handy for correcting lens distortion 
and reducing noise (specks of red, green, and blue) in digital photos.
Some filters aren’t available for images in 16-bit color and some aren’t available 
when you’re working in CMYK (cyan/magenta/yellow/black) color mode. Almost 
all of the filters are available for 8-bit RGB and grayscale images. (No filters are 
available for GIF or PNG-8 images, which use Indexed Color mode.) And keep in 
mind that you can apply filters to specific areas of an image by making a selection 
first. (See Chapter 8 for info on selections and masks.) If you need to use a filter 
and it’s grayed out, choose Image ➪ Mode and convert to 8-bit/channel RGB mode.
Shortcut changes often taking some time to become natural. Here’s one that that 
may just frustrate you: ⌘  +F (Mac)/Ctrl+F (PC) no longer reapplies the last-used 
filter, it now opens a Search dialog box (discussed in Chapter 16). To reapply a 
filter, use ⌘   +Ctrl+F (Mac)/Ctrl+Alt+F (PC). If you want to reapply the last-used 

316     PART 3  Creating “Art” in Photoshop
filter but want to open the dialog box to make changes first, the keyboard short-
cut is ⌘  +Ctrl+Option+F (Mac only; currently there is no comparable shortcut for 
Windows). You can, of course, change the shortcut back to the former shortcut 
through Photoshop’s Edit ➪ Keyboard Shortcuts. Not only does ⌘  +F re-apply the 
last-used filter, it also switches ⌘  +Ctrl+F (Mac)/Ctrl+Alt+F back to re-opening 
the last-used filter’s dialog box.
Sharpening to focus the eye
When looking at an image, your eye is naturally drawn to certain areas first. You 
generally look at bright areas before dark areas and areas of detail before smoother 
areas in the image. Compare, for example, the three photos in Figure 15-2 (which 
were taken using different focal lengths and lens apertures). Using Photoshop’s 
various sharpen and blur filters enables you to control the amount of detail 
throughout your image or, when working with selections, in specific areas in 
order to control the areas to which you want to draw attention.
Photoshop offers six sharpen filters, three of which you can ignore. The Sharpen, 
Sharpen More, and Sharpen Edges filters have no user-definable settings and 
simply work in accordance with their names. Sure, they do a reasonably good 
job, but you don’t have that all-important control over your images! Skip them 
in favor of the they-take-some-work-but-they’re-worth-it sharpening filters: 
Unsharp Mask, Smart Sharpen, and the Shake Reduction filter.
Unsharp Mask
The Unsharp Mask filter is, indeed, a sharpening filter, despite the name (which 
comes from the blurry — unsharp — mask created from a copy of the image and 
used in the sharpening). As you can see in Figure 15-3, Unsharp Mask offers three 
sliders to adjust the appearance of your image.
FIGURE 15-2:

CHAPTER 15  Filters: The Fun Side of Photoshop     317
In the upper left, you see the original image at 100% zoom. The middle image 
shows the sharpening at 100% zoom. To the right is a 300% zoom in the preview 
area of Unsharp Mask’s dialog box.
Always evaluate your filters at 100% zoom even if you need to shrink the view to 
only a critical portion of the artwork. Zoomed in or zoomed out views might not 
accurately reflect the changes that you’re making because the image isn’t dis-
played with one screen pixel representing one image pixel. Although video per-
formance is greatly improved in recent versions of Photoshop, 100% zoom is still 
the safest view in which to make critical decisions. You can, of course, open a 
second view of the same image by choosing Window ➪ Arrange ➪ New Window 
for [filename].
Unsharp Mask works by identifying lines of strong contrast — the edges of ele-
ments within your image — and increases the contrast along those edges. Along 
the border of a dark area and a light area, Unsharp Mask uses a thin band of light 
and a thin band of dark to create a light and dark halo along the edges. That 
makes the edge appear much more defined. Here’s how Unsharp Mask’s sliders 
(as shown in Figure 15-3) work to control the effect.
»
» Amount: The Amount slider determines how much sharpening is actually 
applied by controlling the brightness and darkness of the halo. An amount of 
50% is often suitable for small images that are already in pretty good shape. 
Use 100% for general photos. Use larger values, up to 500%, for special effects.
»
» Radius: Use the Radius slider to determine the width of the halo. You typically 
need a value as low as 1 pixel for small images and perhaps as high as 7 for 
larger images that don’t have a lot of tiny detail.

Despite its 
name, Unsharp 
Mask actually

image.

318     PART 3  Creating “Art” in Photoshop
»
» Threshold: The Threshold slider helps you avoid destroying your image by 
oversharpening fine details. If the tiniest details in the image get wide, bright 
halos, they can look garish and unnatural. The higher the Threshold setting, 
the larger an area must be before sharpening is applied. Typical Threshold 
settings are 2 for a small image and 5 or 7 for a large image.
Smart Sharpen
The Smart Sharpen filter provides you with an incredible amount of control over 
the sharpening process. Although it won’t (quite) be able to give you a crisp image 
of that bank robber from the pixelated, blurry surveillance camera (so far, that 
happens only on TV), it will help you improve just about any image. Those who 
photograph through microscopes and telescopes might find this filter particularly 
useful. However, remember that although you might improve an image, some 
blurs simply won’t be removed by sharpening.
Figure  15-4 shows how well Smart Sharpen works with an appropriate image. 
(Note that the Preview check box is deselected in order to show the unsharp-
ened original to the right. The sharpened version is shown in the filter’s window.) 
In this image, the blurring is consistent throughout the subject of the shot, and 
there is a reasonable amount of blur. In Figure 15-4, you can see that when you 
click the arrow to expand the Shadows/Highlights, all three sections of sliders 
are available. The Reduce Noise option doesn’t reduce noise (as would the Noise 
Reduction filter), but rather reduces the amount of sharpening applied to existing 
noise so that it doesn’t become more prominent. Fading the filter in the shadows 
also helps keep digital noise less visible. Reducing the amount of sharpening in 
the highlights can prevent unwanted attention being drawn to small bright areas 
within the image.
Notice, too, that in the upper section Smart Sharpen enables you to specify any of 
three types of blurring that can be plaguing your image: Gaussian Blur (a uniform 
blur), Lens Blur (areas of blur beyond the focal distance of the lens), and Motion 
Blur (the subject or camera moving while the shot was taken). If you don’t see 
distinct evidence of lens blur or motion blur, stick with Gaussian Blur.
When working with Smart Sharpen, try dragging the Amount slider to perhaps 
250%. Then drag the Radius slider to the right until you start seeing halos along 
distinct edges. Back off the Radius slider a bit to reduce the halos, and then bring 
the Amount slider down to a more reasonable level, to an amount that provides 
the appropriate sharpening for the image content. And if you liked the older ver-
sion of Smart Sharpen, click the gear button in the upper-right and select Use 
Legacy from the menu that appears.

CHAPTER 15  Filters: The Fun Side of Photoshop     319
Shake Reduction
If you shot at a slightly too-slow shutter speed (or during a minor earthquake), 
the image may have some blurring because the camera itself moved a bit while the 
shutter was open. This is most apparent when shooting at the longer focal lengths 
of zoom lenses. The Shake Reduction filter analyzes the image, selects what it 
thinks is a representative area of image upon which to base the amount of shake 
reduction, and then generates a preview. You adjust the sliders (and can change 
the setting in the Source Noise menu from Auto to Low, Medium, or High). The 
Detail window (in the lower-right corner of Figure 15-5) enables you to zoom in 
on an area of the image while making adjustments. The first of the two buttons 
below the Detail window enable you to undock the window so that you can drag 
it anywhere in the left section of the dialog box (which isn’t particularly useful). 
Click the Close button in the upper-left of the floating Detail window to send it 
back to the default area. The second button unlocks the Detail window and you 
can move the cursor anywhere in the preview to the left to show that area in the 
Detail window. To zoom in on the image itself, ⌘  /Ctrl+click. To zoom out, Option/
Alt+click.
In the Advanced section you can show (or hide) the Blur Detection Regions, the 
area(s) being used for analysis. You can move the area (drag the dot in the middle) 
or resize the box (drag the side or corner anchor points). You can also drag new 
rectangles to add additional areas for analysis or drag the Blur Direction tool along 
the line of camera motion. The Delete/Backspace keys delete the currently active 
region. Click the white dot in the center of the active region to temporarily remove 
it from the analysis.

Blurring images and selections
Blurred areas in an image attract less attention than do the sharper parts of the 
photo (refer to Figure 15-2 for an example). By making a selection, you can selec-
tively apply Photoshop’s blur filters. You can also use the blur filters to hide flaws 
in an image, including dust, noise, and unwanted little bits and pieces in the 
picture.
Photoshop now has five powerful blur filters that can be used individually or col-
lectively through the Blur Gallery. See Figure  15-6. In the Filter ➪ Blur Gallery 
menu, select any of the filters to open its interface. Field Blur, Iris Blur, and Tilt-
Shift are now joined by the Path Blur and Spin Blur. Click the box to the right of 
a field name to add that filter to the image; click the name of a filter to open that 
filter’s controls and to adjust its blur.
Photoshop’s Blur Gallery now also includes Path Blur, which enables you to cre-
ate a path and blur along that path, and Spin Blur, which enables you to apply a 
blur around a set of pins. While powerful, you’re not likely to find much use for 
these filters when it’s much simpler to use the Lasso tool to define an area to blur 
(instead of creating a path) and using Photoshop’s traditional Blur ➪ Radial Blur 
command.

CHAPTER 15  Filters: The Fun Side of Photoshop     321
THE EDIT FADE COMMAND
Immediately after applying just about any filter or adjustment command and after using 
many of Photoshop’s tools, you can adjust the effect with the Fade command, found 
under the Edit menu. (Keep in mind that Fade is available only immediately after using a 
filter, adjustment, or tool. You can’t even use the Save command in between.)
With Fade, you can reduce the opacity of the previous command or tool, thus reducing 
its impact on your image. You can also change the blending mode, which alters how the 
command or tool interacts with pixel colors prior to your change. Say, for example, you 
paint a black stroke with the Brush tool set to Normal and 100% opacity. Immediately 
afterward, you choose Edit Fade Brush. You can then pick a new blending mode and/
or reduce the opacity setting, which changes the painted stroke to appear as if you’d 
selected the new settings on the Options bar before painting.
You can also apply the Unsharp Mask (or Smart Sharpen) filter and then choose 
Edit ➪ Fade Unsharp Mask, as shown in the figure here. (Yes, the Fade command 
changes names automatically!) In the Fade dialog box, changing the blending mode  
from Normal to Luminosity ensures that your Unsharp Mask filter doesn’t alter the  
color of pixels along edges. Using the Fade command this way is the same as if you’d 
switched to Lab color mode and sharpened only the L channel — without having to 
switch color modes at all.
Note that the Edit ➪ Fade command isn’t available when you’re working with Smart Filters. 
If you need to fade the filter, you can first choose Layer ➪ Smart Objects ➪ Rasterize and 
then apply the filter. You lose the advantages of working with Smart Objects and Smart 
Filters, but the Edit ➪ Fade command will be available.

322     PART 3  Creating “Art” in Photoshop
Note that each of the first three Blur Gallery filters use “pins” (click in the image 
window) to control the effect. A pin’s amount of blur can be set with the slider in 
the Blur Tools panel or by dragging along the circle that surrounds the active pin. 
Click any pin and use the Delete/Backspace key to remove it. Clicking the button 
to the right of Preview removes all pins, eliminating the blur and enabling you to 
start from scratch.
Each of the three primary Blur Gallery filters uses pins slightly differently:
»
» Field Blur: Adjust the blur for the first pin to control blur throughout the 
image. Add additional pins in other parts of the image with different amounts 
of blur to create fields of blurring. You might, for example, have a pin to the 
left in the image with a substantial blur and a pin to the right with a lesser 
amount of blur to gradually blur the image from one side to the other. 
Alternatively, you might add a pin to the center of the image with little or no 
blur, and pins in each corner of the image with a substantial blur, leaving only 
the center in focus.
»
» Iris Blur: Drag the pin (and click to add additional pins) and then adjust the 
inner and outer rings by dragging anchor points. The outer ring represents 
where the blur is fully applied, while the inner ring controls how much 
feathering there is between “in focus” and “blurred.” Drag the outer ring’s 
anchor points to control both size and shape, and position the cursor outside 
the ring and drag to rotate. Drag the diamond-shaped anchor point outward 
to flatten from an ellipse to a rounded rectangle. You’ll probably find that 
you’ll most often use a single pin with Iris Blur.
FIGURE 15-6: 
The Blur 
­Gallery now 
offers five 
filters.

CHAPTER 15  Filters: The Fun Side of Photoshop     323
»
» Tilt-Shift: Used to simulate the blurring created by a tilt-shift lens, often used 
in architectural photography. In tilt-shift photography, the lens elements can 
be manually adjusted to change the angle between the lens and the plane of 
capture (the sensor in a digital camera), and to change the position of the lens 
relative to the center of the image plane. This often produces a band of “in 
focus,” with the areas on either side out of focus. When using Tilt-Shift in the 
Blur Gallery rather than in the field, drag the dashed lines to establish the 
point where the blur is fully applied, drag the solid line to control feathering 
between blurred and focused, and drag the control points on the solid line to 
rotate. Tilt-Shift’s distortion slider can be used to introduce distortion of 
details in one side of the blur (or both sides with Systemic Distortion active). 
Typically, Tilt-Shift uses one pin.
The Bokeh panel is used to control the quality of the highlights in the blurred area. 
Use the Light Bokeh slider to control “blooming” of highlights in the blurred area. 
Use the Bokeh Color slider to manage saturation in the areas around the high-
lights. Use the Light Range slider to control how much of (or what part of) the 
tonal range is controlled by the Light Bokeh slider.
While working in the Blur Gallery, you can hide the pins and circles or lines with 
the shortcut ⌘  +H or Ctrl+H to preview without distraction. For precision, you can 
show/hide the grid with the shortcut ⌘  +’ or Ctrl+’ (the apostrophe key).
The other Blur filters
Photoshop provides you with almost a dozen blur filters via the Filters ➪ Blur 
menu in addition to those of the Blur Gallery. Some of them you’re not likely to 
use at all, such as the Blur and Blur More filters, which give you no control over 
the process, and Average, which creates a solid color that’s an average of all the 
colors in the image or selection. (The Average blur does have one valuable use 
described in Chapter 6 for setting a neutral point in your image.) Some you may 
use for creative effects, including Box Blur, with which you use a slider to con-
trol the vertical and horizontal blurring, and Shape Blur, which blurs based on 
a custom shape that you select. Motion Blur and the Radial Blur (which has no 
preview — still!) can be useful, especially when used on a selection within a piece 
of artwork.
The blur filters with which you’re most likely to work are
»
» Gaussian Blur: This filter produces a smoothly blurred version of your image 
(or an area within a selection in the image) without the distracting artifacts 
and lines you get by repeatedly applying the Blur More filter. The Radius slider 
enables you to control the amount of blurring.

324     PART 3  Creating “Art” in Photoshop
»
» Lens Blur: This filter simulates the effect in which the camera’s zoom and 
aperture create a sharp foreground and a blurry background. You can use an 
alpha channel (a saved selection) to determine where and how strongly the 
filter is applied. For a look at the Lens Blur filter in action, see Figure 15-7.
»
» Smart Blur: This filter controls the blur by recognizing edges (areas of 
extreme difference along a line of pixels) and blurring within those areas. You 
can use Smart Blur in Normal mode to eliminate all fine detail in your image, 
use it again in Edge Only mode to trace edges in the image, and then use the 
shortcut ⌘  +I/Ctrl+I, which produces a black-on-white sketch of your original.
»
» Surface Blur: This filter goes beyond Smart Blur in preserving edges. It 
restricts the blur to large areas of similar color in the image, eliminating the 
fine detail. It can be very useful for preparing images prior to using the 
creative filters of the Filter Gallery (about which you can read later in this 
chapter).
Correcting for the vagaries of lenses
Found near the top of the Filter menu, the Adaptive Wide Angle filter is designed 
for use with wide angle and fisheye lenses. If a lens profile is available (and the 
lens data is recorded in the image’s metadata), the filter will open up with the 
FIGURE 15-7: 
Lens Blur can 
use an alpha 
channel (mask) 
to control  
the blur.

CHAPTER 15  Filters: The Fun Side of Photoshop     325
Correction menu set to Auto and the lens profile will be applied. If the filter cannot 
determine what lens was used or if there’s no available profile for that lens, select 
Fisheye or Perspective in the Correction menu and manually adjust the image. 
(The Correction menu also offers Full Spherical as a correction option.)
Adaptive Wide Angle offers five tools in the upper-left corner (shown in Figure 15-8). 
Use the Constraint tool to drag between two points in the image that should form 
a vertical or horizontal line, and then drag to the existing curved line, as shown 
in Figure 15-8. When you release the mouse button, the filter will straighten the 
image based on that line. Click the Polygon Constraint tool in the four corners 
of anything in the image that should be rectangular to help the filter minimize 
distortion. The Move tool can be used to reposition the image in the canvas, and 
the Hand and Zoom tools perform their usual tasks. Note, too, the Detail window 
to the right, which gives you a close-up view of whatever section of the image is 
under the cursor. If you shot a series of images with the same lens, you can save 
the constraints you used to correct the first image and later load the constraints 
for additional corrections to other images. You can access the Save and Load com-
mands by clicking the button to the right of the Correction menu.
The Adaptive Wide Angle and Lens Correction filters are dandy, but if you shoot 
Raw, consider using the Lens Corrections tab in Camera Raw instead (see Chap-
ter 7). Working in Camera Raw enables you to make the corrections on unpro-
cessed image data and such corrections can always be tinkered with at a later date.
The Lens Correction filter (choose Filter ➪ Lens Correction) does a wonderful job 
of cleaning up pin cushioning and barrel distortion (the outer edges of your image 
FIGURE 15-8:

preview area,

appear to bend inward or outward, respectively). You’ll see pin cushioning when 
shooting with a telephoto lens at its max zoom and barrel distortion at the lens’s 
lower magnification. Both are most obvious when the photo has what should be 
straight lines at the edges. You can also use Lens Correction to adjust the vertical 
or horizontal plane of an image, as well as perspective (as discussed in Chapter 9). 
In Figure 15-9, you see the Lens Correction window’s rather complex Custom and 
Auto Correction panels.
Here’s what you have at your disposal in the Lens Correction window.
In the upper-left corner of the window are five tools:
»
» Remove Distortion (top): Select this tool to drag in the preview area to adjust 
the distortion factor.
»
» Straighten (second): This tool is simple: Click and drag along any line in the 
image that should be straight, and the image is straightened!
»
» Move Grid (middle): Use this to reposition the grid overlay, aligning it with 
the content of your image.
»
» Hand and Zoom: The lower pair of tools should look familiar. The Hand and 
Zoom tools function as they do everywhere in Photoshop: When the image 
doesn’t fit in the window, click and drag with the Hand tool to reposition; click 
the Zoom tool to zoom in, or Option/Alt+click to zoom out.
FIGURE 15-9: 
In addition to 
the extensive 
control in 
the Custom 
panel, Lens 
­Correction also 
offers Auto 
Correction.

CHAPTER 15  Filters: The Fun Side of Photoshop     327
In the Custom panel, you can also find
»
» Remove Distortion slider: The Remove Distortion slider is the heart of this 
filter. You use this to compensate for pin cushioning or barrel distortion in the 
image. Drag it back and forth until your image’s vertical and horizontal lines 
are straight throughout the image.
»
» Chromatic Aberration sliders: Sometimes a photograph shows distorted 
color along angular lines, such as the branches of trees or latticework. You can 
minimize these colored halos or fringes with the Chromatic Aberration sliders. 
Generally speaking, you want to zoom in close on a specific area of detail to 
make the adjustment.
»
» Vignette sliders: Drag the Amount slider to the left to add a dark vignette 
(fading along the outer edges of the image) or correct a light vignette; drag to 
the right to add a white vignette or remove a dark vignette. The Midpoint 
slider increases and decreases the amount of shadowing or highlight along 
the edges.
»
» Transform controls: Use the Vertical Perspective and Horizontal Perspective 
sliders to make your image appear parallel to the viewer. Much like using the 
Perspective Crop option or the Edit ➪ Transform ➪ Perspective command, 
you’re changing the perceived angle of the image to the viewer. (Look back at 
Figure 9-13 to see perspective adjustment in action.)
»
» Zoom and Grid: Click the minus and plus buttons in the lower-left corner to 
zoom out and in, or choose a preset zoom factor from the pop-up menu. Click 
and drag on the Size field’s label (the actual word Size) to resize the grid. Click 
the color swatch to change the color from the default gray. (I liked bright 
yellow for the image in Figure 15-9.)
»
» Saving and loading settings: From the Lens Correction window’s menu (to 
the right of the Settings pop-up menu), you can save settings and load them 
later. Because you can name the settings, you can save a set for each of your 
lenses, at each of their zoom factors, and apply the same correction easily, 
time after time.
The Auto Corrections panel, shown to the right in Figure 15-9, enables you to 
apply pre-defined corrections, based on the camera and lens used to capture the 
image. Most recent-model high-end DSLRs from major manufacturers are sup-
ported, along with a variety of lenses. If you don’t see a preset for your camera/
lens combination, click the button to the right of Lens Profiles and you can browse 
lens profiles online — other photographers using the same gear may have posted 
a lens profile that’s right for you. Remember that Auto Correction is used to com-
pensate for the vagaries of the camera/lens combination — lens distortion, chro-
matic aberration, and light falloff toward the edges of the image (vignetting). Use 
the Custom panel to correct for the problems listed earlier in this section.

328     PART 3  Creating “Art” in Photoshop
Cleaning up with Reduce Noise
Digital noise — those annoying red, green, and blue specks in your image —can 
ruin an otherwise lovely picture. (To avoid noise, set your camera to the lowest 
ISO appropriate for the available light and shutter speed.) Photoshop has a filter 
for reducing (not necessarily eliminating) digital noise in your images. Found in 
the Filter ➪ Noise menu, Reduce Noise can do an excellent job of minimizing the 
random red, green, and blue pixels in your image.
When you work with Raw images, do all your noise correction in the Camera Raw 
plug-in. (See Chapter 7.) For images in formats other than Raw, use the Reduce 
Noise filter.
Here are the steps that I recommend when you use the Reduce Noise filter:
1.	 Set the details sliders to 0 (zero).
In the Reduce Noise dialog box, drag the Preserve Details and Sharpen Details 
sliders all the way to the left. This eliminates any interference with the actual 
noise reduction.
2.	 Reduce Color Noise.
Use the Reduce Color Noise slider to minimize the red, green, and blue specks 
in your image. Drag the slider slowly to the right until the color noise is gone.
3.	 Adjust Sharpen Details.
Increase the Sharpen Details slider 1% at a time until the color noise returns; 
then back off 1%.
4.	 Adjust Preserve Details.
Drag the Preserve Details slider to the right until you have a good balance 
between image detail and any luminance noise (bright and dark specks) in the 
image.
If you see noise of one color considerably longer than the others when dragging 
the Reduce Color Noise slider, click the Advanced button near the top of the dialog 
box and work with each channel individually, according to its needs. Also note 
the Remove JPEG Artifact check box at the bottom of the window. If your image is 
suffering from JPEG compression problems, selecting that check box might help 
relieve the effects. (JPEG compression often results in visible borders between 
8x8-pixel squares within your image.) Remember, too, that you can use the but-
ton to the right of the Settings pop-up menu to save your correction for future 
use — it will be added to the Setting menu.

CHAPTER 15  Filters: The Fun Side of Photoshop     329
Getting Creative and Artistic
Photoshop offers much more than just “fix it” filters. In the Filter menu and the 
Filter Gallery (opened through the Filter menu), you’ll find more than 80 features 
designed to help you produce creative artwork.
Photo to painting with the Oil Paint filter
The Oil Paint filter, found in the Stylize section of the Filter menu, is yet another 
way to create a painterly effect for a photo. Using the six sliders you see in  
Figure 15-10, you can create a wide range of looks. Oil Paint is best used with 
images of larger pixel dimensions — you may find it impossible to reduce the set-
tings enough to present an acceptable result on small images. (You can, of course, 
use Image Size to increase an image’s pixel dimensions, work with Oil Paint, and 
then use Image Size to reduce the pixel dimensions again.)
The filter’s Preview shows the current settings on a small area of the image.  
Click the Preview box to see the filter’s settings applied in the image window.  
In Figure 15-10, to the right, you can see some of the original image.
FIGURE 15-10: 
Oil Paint 
­creates artistic 
renderings of 
photographic 
images.

330     PART 3  Creating “Art” in Photoshop
Oil Paint identifies contiguous areas of similar color in the image and contours the 
brush strokes to follow the lines of color. The appearance of the individual brush 
strokes depends primarily on a balance of the four sliders in the Brush section of 
the dialog box. When first experimenting with Oil Paint, you might find it easiest 
to drag the Cleanliness slider all the way to the right, the Bristle Detail slider all the 
way to the left, and then work with the Stylization and Scale brushes to get a good 
look for the content of the image with which you’re working. After you’ve nailed 
the general appearance, fine-tune the strokes with Cleanliness and Bristle Detail.
Don’t forget to experiment with the Lighting fields — they can make a huge dif-
ference in the appearance of the image. Zoom in to 200% and drag the line in the 
Angle circle slowly back and forth until the image has the right visual balance 
between brush strokes and detail. (Think of 90 and 270 degrees as being up/down 
and zero, 180, and 360 degrees as left/right.) Zoom back out to 100% to fine-tune 
the Shine setting.
The Oil Paint filter requires that Use Graphic Processor be enabled in Photoshop’s 
Preferences ➪ Performance. If your computer’s video card doesn’t support this 
feature, Oil Paint won’t be available. Keep in mind, too, that Oil Paint is available 
only for RGB images in either 8-bit or 16-bit color and Smart Objects created from 
such images.
Working with the Filter Gallery
You can apply and combine lots of Photoshop’s creative filters by choosing 
­Filter ➪ Filter Gallery. This integrated window lets you use multiple filters at the 
same time rather than guessing which settings will look good with another filter 
applied later. Each filter remains live (you can change the settings) until you click 
OK. Check out Figure 15-11.
If Filter Gallery is grayed out and unavailable, head for the Image ➪ Mode menu 
and select 8-Bits/Channel — the Filter Gallery is not available for images in 16-bit 
color. Keep in mind, too, that the Filter Gallery can be applied as a Smart Filter 
when working with Smart Objects.
After working with the Filter Gallery for some time you may find that you’re 
only applying one filter at a time. If that’s the case, you can open Photoshop’s 
­Preferences ➪ Plug-Ins and elect to have all of the filters and filter groups shown 
in the Filter menu. You can then open the Filter Gallery directly to the filter you 
want to apply.
The basic workflow goes like this: Adjust a filter, add a new filter to the stack, 
select the new filter in the middle pane, adjust the settings to the right, add a new 
filter to the stack, and so on. If you adjust your first filter settings and then click 
another filter in the middle column before adding another effect, you replace the 

CHAPTER 15  Filters: The Fun Side of Photoshop     331
first filter rather than adding to it. (If you Option/Alt+click a new filter, it will be 
added to the stack rather than replace the active filter in the stack.) Here’s my 
step-by-step strategy for working in the Filter Gallery window:
1.	 Prepare your image before entering the Filter Gallery.
Many of Photoshop’s creative filters work best when you prepare the image (or 
parts of the image) first. You have a couple of key filters that don’t appear in 
Filter Gallery:
•	 Smoothing detail: Because Photoshop’s art-related filters can concentrate 
on details in your image, too much fine detail can make your filter effects 
crowded and cruddy. Before working with Ink Outlines, for example, try 
eliminating the tiny little bits in your image. You could try either Smart Blur 
or Surface Blur.
•	 Adding detail: Many of Photoshop’s filters don’t do anything if the target 
area doesn’t have some texture or detail with which to work. That’s where 
the Add Noise filter comes in handy, adding dark and light specks to the 
smooth area. Use the Monochromatic and Gaussian options, with an 
FIGURE 15-11: 
The expansive 
Filter Gallery 
interface.

332     PART 3  Creating “Art” in Photoshop
Amount setting from 10% to 15%. After adding noise to the too-smooth 
area, consider using the Blur ➪ Motion Blur filter (to create a linear effect) 
or the Pixelate ➪ Crystallize filter (to make small specks bigger).
2.	 Don’t forget layers and blending modes.
Make a copy of your layer before entering the Filter Gallery so you can later mess 
around with layer blending modes and opacity to combine the filtered version 
with the original, which can soften or even enhance the effects you’ve applied.
3.	 Option/Alt+click to add a filter or add to the stack before selecting filters.
If you simply click a different filter, it replaces the filter with which you had been 
working. Either Option/Alt+click the new filter or click the New Filter button in 
the lower-right corner before clicking the filter you want to add to the stack.
4.	 Play with the stacking order.
Drag filters up and down in the stack at the lower right to change their order.
The order in which the filters are applied often makes a huge difference in the 
final appearance of your image.
5.	 Use the eyeball column.
It’s a good idea sometimes to hide one or more effects in the stack while you 
fine-tune a filter’s settings.
Filters are cumulative — changes that you make to one filter can themselves be 
changed by other filters in the stack.
Not all creative filters are available in the Filter Gallery. Remember that Photo-
shop has dozens of filters that are available only through the Filter menu, not 
through Filter Gallery.
The cheat sheet for this book lists which of Photoshop’s creative filters use the 
current foreground color, background color, or both. Have the correct colors 
selected before entering the Filter Gallery. (Search for the cheat sheet on dummies.
com using the book’s title.)
Push, Pull, and Twist with Liquify
Although the Lens Correction and Adaptive Wide Angle filters have added power-
ful correction tools to your arsenal, you still want to sometimes fix a photograph’s 
perspective or barrel distortion with Liquify. Perhaps. But with Camera Raw’s 
Lens Correction tab and the corrective filters available in Photoshop, Liquify can 
concentrate on its fun side.

CHAPTER 15  Filters: The Fun Side of Photoshop     333
I know of nothing in Photoshop that can bring a smile faster and more easily 
than creating some strange creature from a friend or loved one in Liquify. I read-
ily admit that the glow produced by the praise of an art critic is gratifying, but 
does it compare to, “More, Uncle Pete! Give me bigger ears!”? It would certainly 
be a disservice to the Liquify feature to overlook its powerful image-correction 
capabilities, so please remember that almost anything you can do to emphasize or 
enhance an attribute can be done in reverse to minimize that aspect of the image. 
Make someone short and wide? You can also make them tall and thin. Creating a 
bulging nose? Create a slim and pert nose. It’s all possible with Liquify.
That having been said, examine Figure  15-12, which shows some rather dra-
matic changes, with the original visible behind and to the left. (This should give 
you some idea of how useful Liquify can be for more subtle tasks, like trimming 
tummies, toning arms and legs, thinning noses, and other such work.) Note that 
Liquify no longer offers an Advanced Mode button — you’re always in “advanced 
mode” now.
Notice that if you have people in your image, Liquify’s Face-Aware Liquify options 
are available, enabling you to work on eyes, noses, mouths, and face shapes.

334     PART 3  Creating “Art” in Photoshop
Take a look at the tools arrayed along the left edge of Liquify. Here’s what they 
do, starting at the top:
»
» Forward Warp: Much like Photoshop’s Smudge tool, you click and drag the 
Forward Warp tool to push the pixels around.
»
» Reconstruct: Use the Reconstruct tool as your “undo.” Drag over areas that 
you want to restore to their original appearance. When in Liquify, you can also 
use the Edit menu’s commands Undo, Redo, and Step Backwards and their 
assigned shortcuts.
»
» Smooth: Drag the tool to smooth sharp changes.
»
» Twirl Clockwise: Click and hold the mouse button down or drag in a circle to 
spin the pixels within the brush diameter. And if you want to twirl counter-
clockwise, simply add the Option/Alt key.
»
» Pucker: The Pucker tool sucks pixels into the center of the brush. You can 
click and hold or drag the Pucker tool. Holding down the Option/Alt key 
toggles you to the Bloat tool’s behavior (although you don’t actually switch 
tools).
»
» Bloat: The opposite of the Pucker tool, the Bloat tool pushes pixels out from 
the center. Holding down the Option/Alt key switches to the Pucker tool’s 
behavior.
»
» Push Left: As you drag the Push Left tool, pixels are shifted to the left of the 
path along which you drag (not necessarily to your left). If you drag up, the 
pixels are shifted to the left on the screen; drag down, and the pixels are 
shifted to the right on-screen. Press the Option/Alt key to reverse the behavior 
and push pixels to the right of the path.
»
» Freeze Mask: One of the most important tools, the Freeze Mask tool lets you 
protect areas of your image from change. Paint over an area (you see a red 
mask) to freeze it — to keep it from changing.
»
» Thaw Mask: Unprotect areas with the Thaw Mask tool. It removes the red 
overlay and lets you liquify the area again.
»
» Face: When you have people in an image, click the Face tool to help identify 
their faces.
»
» Hand: As always, the Hand tool lets you reposition an image in the window 
when it doesn’t all fit. Just click and drag your image to move it in the preview 
window.
»
» Zoom: As you might suspect, the Zoom tool functions as it usually does. Click 
to zoom in, Option/Alt+click to zoom out, and click and drag to zoom in on a 
specific area.

CHAPTER 15  Filters: The Fun Side of Photoshop     335
To the right in the Liquify window are a number of variables and options. Brush 
Size is the tool brush diameter, Brush Density is comparable to feathering (lower 
is softer), Brush Pressure controls the strength of the active tool, and Brush Rate 
controls the speed with which a tool works.
The Reconstruct Options let you restore or partially restore your image to the 
original appearance. The Reconstruct button opens a slider with which you can 
back off the changes you’ve made. Keep in mind that the slider moves from the 
“Liquified” version to the “pre-Liquify” version of your image. It selectively 
reverses all of the changes made, not just the previous change. The Restore All 
button returns your image to its pre-Liquify appearance.
You can make a selection before opening Liquify to work on only a portion of your 
image. If there’s a layer mask on the active layer, you can use it as the basis for a 
“freeze” in the Mask options. In the column of adjustments on the right side of 
the Liquify window (refer to Figure 15-12), you have options to show a mask and 
a mesh to help you see what you’re doing to the image.
Do I Need Those Other Filters?
Photoshop has dozens of filters, creative and productive, that you access through 
the Filter menu rather than through the Filter Gallery. Some do strange and won-
derful things to your selection or image, and some just do strange things that you 
might never need. You can find a description of each of the filters in Photoshop’s 
Help, but a couple of them are worth a bit of attention here.
In the Filter ➪ Render menu, you’ll now find Flame, Picture Frame, and Tree 
options. Play with them when you get a chance. You may or may not ever find a 
time to use them.
Adding drama with Lighting Effects
In the Filter ➪ Render menu is the powerful Lighting Effects filter, with which you 
can add spotlights, point lights, and infinite lights. You can choose a preset from 
the menu in the upper left (see Figure 15-13) or customize the lights by adding 
and adjusting the lights of your choice. Click one of the three light buttons in the 
upper left, drag the light into position, and then adjust the light with the sliders in 
the Properties panel. Select which light is active in the Lights panel. In the image 
window, you can drag to change the angle of a spot light or an infinite light, the 
scale of a point light, and the shape of a spot light.

336     PART 3  Creating “Art” in Photoshop
The Lighting Effects filter is available for RGB images in 8-bit color only, and for 
Smart Objects created from such images. If you want to use Lighting Effects with 
a grayscale image, you can add a Black & White adjustment or adjustment layer, 
or head to the Image ➪ Mode menu and convert to Grayscale and then convert 
back to RGB.
Maximum and Minimum
In the Filter ➪ Other menu, the greatly improved Maximum and Minimum fil-
ters are perfect for adjusting layer masks. Use Maximum to expand the visible 
area of the layer and use Minimum to reduce the visible area. Both filters enable 
you to specify whether to protect the “squareness” or “roundness” of the mask. 
Remember to click the layer mask in the Layers panel before opening these filters. 
If the layer thumbnail is active, you’ll be creating some rather interesting special 
effects rather than modifying the layer mask, with Maximum expanding bright 
areas and Minimum expanding shadows.
Bending and bubbling
In the Filter ➪ Distort menu, you find both the Shear and the Spherize filters, both 
of which are simpler alternatives to Liquify for many projects. Use the Shear filter 
to bend a selection back and forth, creating curves. Use Spherize to create a bulg-
ing, rounded image. Both Shear and Spherize are easiest to control when you make 
a selection of your target and copy it to a new layer. Shear works only vertically, so 
you might need to rotate your image before and after using the filter.

the upper left,

the lower left, 
and an infinite 
light in the 
center.

CHAPTER 15  Filters: The Fun Side of Photoshop     337
Creating clouds
Clouds make lovely, unobtrusive backgrounds that can be scaled and transformed 
to produce smoke or steam, and you can even create marbling effects from clouds. 
(See Figure 15-14.) In the Filter ➪ Render menu, you find Clouds and Difference 
Clouds. Both filters use a mixture of the foreground and background colors to cre-
ate a cloud pattern. The Clouds filter replaces the content of the selection or layer 
(if any), and Difference Clouds interacts with the existing pixels (you can’t use it 
on an empty layer) pretty much like Clouds using the Difference blending mode. 
Apply Difference Clouds several times, perhaps as many as 20, to create abstract 
backgrounds and marble patterns, or perhaps to simulate microscope slides.

Streamlining Your 
Work in Photoshop
A 
lot of the work that you do in Photoshop is fun — experimenting with 
­filters, applying creative adjustments, cloning over former in-laws, that 
sort of thing. A bunch of your work, though, is likely to be repetitive, 
­mundane, and even downright boring. That’s where automation comes in. If a 
task isn’t fun to do, if you need to speed things up, or if you need to ensure that 
the exact same steps are taken time after time, automation is for you.
I begin the chapter with a look at Photoshop’s Actions and the Batch command, 
which enable you to process many files automatically. I’ll then introduce the new 
Search feature. Next, I take a look at PDF Presentation and Contact Sheet II (used 
to show and print multiple images on a single page). Following those two powerful 
features, I show you the Crop and Straighten Photos feature, a neat way to effec-
tively scan multiple images into Photoshop in a single pass. After that, I give you 
a quick look at scripts, such as the very powerful Image Processor. Scripts are sort 
of little computer programs that you use to control your computer — Photoshop, 
other programs, your printer, or even an operating system itself.

Ready, Set, Action!
In Photoshop, an Action is simply a recorded series of steps that you can play back 
on another image to replicate an effect or technique. To choose a wild example, 
say that every image in your new book about Photoshop needs to be submitted at 
a size of exactly 1,024 x 768 pixels at 300 ppi, regardless of content. Record an 
Action that uses the Image Size command to change resolution and then use the 
Canvas Size command to expand the image to 1,024 x 768 pixels. Use that Action 
(play the Action) on each image before submitting it. Better yet, wait until all the 
images for a chapter are ready and then use the Batch command to play the Action 
automatically on each of them!
Actions and the Batch command not only streamline repetitive tasks; they also 
ensure precision  — that every one of those images will be exactly 1,024 x 768 
pixels, each and every time. But Actions also have a creative side to them. The 
lower part of the Actions panel’s menu (see Figure 16-1) contains sets of Actions 
that you can load into the panel to produce frame and border effects, text effects, 
and more. (The content of your Actions panel menu will differ from what’s shown 
in Figure  16-1.) You can also purchase collections of Actions from commercial 
sources.
To work with an Action, open an image, select the Action in the Actions panel, and 
then click the Play button at the bottom of the panel. (The three buttons to the left 
use the near-universal symbols for Stop, Record, and Play; the three to the right 
use the standard Adobe symbols indicating New Set, New Action, and Trash. Refer 
to Figure 16-1.)
Any step in the Actions panel that doesn’t have a check mark in the left column is 
skipped when you play the Action. Any step that has a symbol visible in the second 
column (the Modal Control column) pauses when you play the Action. Click in 
the second column when you want the Action to wait for you to do something. 
Perhaps you’ll click in that column next to a Crop step so that you can adjust the 
Crop tool’s bounding box. You might click in the second column next to an Image 
Size step so that you can input a specific size or choose a resampling algorithm. 
After you make a change or input a value for that step, press Return/Enter to 
continue playing the Action.
Notice the Save Actions command in the panel’s menu in Figure 16-1. Remember 
that you have to select a set of Actions in the panel, not an individual Action, to use 
the Save Actions command. If you want to save only one Action, create a new set 
and Option/Alt+drag the Action to that set to copy it. You can also create a print-
able text file (.txt) of your Actions set by holding down the ⌘  +Option/Ctrl+Alt 
keys when selecting Save Actions. Text versions of your Actions provide an easy 
reference for what each Action (and step) does to an image.

CHAPTER 16  Streamlining Your Work in Photoshop     343
If you get hooked on Actions, you’ll also want to try Button Mode in the Actions 
panel menu. Each Action appears in the panel as a color-coded button. You don’t 
see the steps of the Action, so you don’t know whether an individual step is being 
skipped and you can’t change the Modal Control column, but you might like the 
color-coding to sort your Actions.
Recording your own Actions
The real power of Actions comes when you record your own. Sure, the sets of 
Actions included with Photoshop are great, and the commercial packages of 
Actions have some good stuff too, but it’s not your stuff. When you record your 
own Actions, you record the steps that work for your images, your workflow, and 
your artistic vision.
FIGURE 16-1: 
The Actions 
panel menu 
includes sets 
of Actions you 
can load into 
the panel.

344     PART 4  Power Photoshop
Actions can’t float free in Photoshop’s Actions panel: Each Action must be part of 
a set of Actions. Before beginning to record your Action, you can select an existing 
set or click the fourth button at the bottom of the panel to create a new set. When 
you have a set selected, you can then click the New Action button (second from 
right). Then, in the New Action dialog box that appears (as shown in Figure 16-2),  
assign a name (and color-code for Button Mode and perhaps choose an F-key 
combination as a keyboard shortcut for playing the Action) and click the Record 
button. From that point forward, just about everything you do in Photoshop is 
recorded as part of the Action until you click the Stop button at the bottom of the 
Actions panel. No worries, though — you can always delete unwanted steps from 
a recorded Action by dragging them to the Trash icon at the bottom of the Actions 
panel. And if you want to change something in the Action, you can double-click a 
step and rerecord it.
(You’ll read this again, but that little Warning symbol hopefully drives home the 
importance of this info.) Open the image with which you want to record the Action 
before you start recording. Otherwise that Open step is part of the Action and when 
you play the Action, it always opens that image and plays the steps on it rather 
than your intended image. Of course, if you want to use a special image in your 
Action, say a file that contains your copyright info as a graphic that you want to 
copy/paste into the image on which you’re working, you would indeed record the 
Open command within the Action (just not as the first step).
You can record most of Photoshop’s commands and tools in an Action, but you 
can’t control anything outside of Photoshop. (For that you need scripting, intro-
duced later in this chapter.) You can’t, for example, use an Action to print (con-
trolling the printer’s own print driver), copy a filename from the Mac Finder or 
Windows Explorer, or open Illustrator and select a path to add to your Photoshop 
document. Here are some tips about recording your own custom Actions:
FIGURE 16-2: 
After you click 
the New Action 
button, you 
see the 
New Action 
dialog box.

CHAPTER 16  Streamlining Your Work in Photoshop     345
»
» Open a file first. Open the file in which you’re going to work before you 
start recording the Action. Otherwise, as you have been warned, the Open 
command becomes part of the Action, and the Action will play on that specific 
file every time you use it. You can, however, record the Open command within 
an Action to open a second file — perhaps to copy something from that file.
»
» Record the Close command after Save As. When you record the Save As 
command in an Action, you’re creating a new file on your hard drive. Follow 
the Save As command with the File ➪ Close command and elect Don’t Save 
when prompted. That closes and preserves the original image.
»
» Use Percent as the unit of measure. If you need an element in your artwork 
to be in the same relative spot regardless of file size or shape (like a copyright 
notice in the lower-right corner), change the unit of measure to Percent in 
Photoshop’s Preferences before recording the Action.
»
» Record/insert menu commands. When you use a menu command while 
recording your Action, the actual values that you enter into the dialog box are 
recorded, too. If you’d rather select the values appropriate for each individual 
image (perhaps for the Unsharp Mask filter or the Image Size command), 
insert the command rather than record it. When you reach that specific spot 
in your process, use the Actions panel menu command Insert Menu Item. 
(Refer to Figure 16-1.) With the dialog box open, mouse to and select the 
appropriate menu command; then click OK to continue recording the Action. 
In Figure 16-3, you see the Insert Menu Item dialog box when first opened 
(before a command is selected) and after I used the mouse to select the 
Image Size command from Photoshop’s Image menu.
FIGURE 16-3:

Menu Item

box open when

346     PART 4  Power Photoshop
»
» Record multiple versions of a step, but activate one. Say you want to 
record an Action that does a lot of stuff to an image, including changing the 
pixel dimensions with the Image Size command. However, you want to use 
this Action with a variety of images that require two or three different final 
sizes. You can record as many Image Size commands as you want in that one 
Action — just remember to deselect the left column in the Actions panel next 
to each of the Image Size steps except the one you currently want to use.
»
» Record Actions inside Actions. While recording an Action, you can select 
another Action and click the Actions panel’s Play button — the selected Action 
will be recorded within the new Action.
»
» Insert a message or warning. Use the Actions panel menu Insert Stop 
command to send a message to anyone who plays your Action. The message 
could be something like “You must have a type layer active in the Layers panel 
before playing this Action” with buttons for Stop and Continue. Or you could 
phrase it more specifically: “If you have not selected a type layer in the Layers 
panel, click Stop. If a type layer is active in the Layers panel, click Continue.” 
The more precise the message, the less confusion later. In Figure 16-4, you 
see the Record Stop dialog box, where you type your message when record-
ing the Action (top), as well as a look at how the message appears when the 
Action is played back later (bottom).
»
» Insert a conditional Action. If you choose the menu command Insert 
Conditional while recording an Action, you can choose from a list of situations 
(as shown to the right in Figure 16-5), and select an existing Action to play.  
FIGURE 16-4: 
Insert a Stop 
to show a 
message when 
the Action is 
played.

CHAPTER 16  Streamlining Your Work in Photoshop     347
If, for example, you need to have a flattened image for a specific situation, first 
record an Action by choosing Layer ➪ Flatten Image. Then, when recording 
your more complex Action, insert the conditional Document Has Layers and 
elect to play your Flatten Image Action. If you run the complex Action on an 
image that’s already flattened, Photoshop will skip the Flatten Image Action 
specified in the conditional.
»
» Remember Conditional Mode Change and Fit Image. These two com-
mands in the File ➪ Automate menu are designed to be recorded in an Action 
that you might later use on a wide variety of images.
•	 Conditional Mode Change is very handy when your Action (or final result) 
depends on the image being in a specific color mode. When you record 
Conditional Mode Change in an Action, every image, regardless of its 
original color mode, is converted to the target color mode (see Figure 16-5). 
Say, for example, that you need to apply a certain filter in an Action, but 
that filter is available only for RGB images. If you record Conditional Mode 
Change before running the filter, the Action will play properly.
•	 Fit Image specifies a maximum width and height that the image being 
processed must not exceed, regardless of size or shape — great for 
batch-processing images for the web. Fit Image maintains your images’ 
aspect ratios (to avoid distortion) while ensuring that every image pro-
cessed fits within the parameters you specify. (See Figure 16-5.) If you  
need all landscape-oriented images to be 800x600 pixels and all portrait-
oriented images to be 600x800 pixels, enter 800 in both the width and the 
height fields.

348     PART 4  Power Photoshop
Notice the Don’t Enlarge check box in the Fit Image dialog box. If you’re 
prepping images for a website and reducing them to a specific size to 
make them download and display faster, you don’t necessarily want to 
enlarge some of the images, making them download slower. Disable this 
option when you’re trying to make all the images uniform in size, perhaps 
for the creation of a PDF presentation (discussed later in this chapter).
»
» Always record an Action using a copy of your image. Because the steps 
that you record in the Action are actually executed on the open file, record 
your Action using a copy of the original image. That way, if something goes 
wrong, your original image is protected.
The Actions panel menu also offers the Allow Tool Recording option. This feature 
enables you to record tools such as the Brush and the Clone Stamp in Actions. 
However, there are a few limitations. While you can record the tool, you can’t 
record changing its settings. If, for example, you recorded the Action using a 
feathered 40-pixel brush tip, you’ll need to remember to select that brush tip 
prior to playing the Action. In addition, the data recorded for the tool movement 
is device-specific. If you record the Action on one computer and play it back on a 
computer using a different video card and/or monitor, the results may be slightly 
different. Do not depend on Actions that record tool movement for precision!
Working with the Batch command
Choosing File ➪ Automate ➪ Batch lets you play back an Action on a number of 
files. You select an Action to play and also a folder of image files to play it on; then 
you decide what you want to do with the files after the Action finishes with them. 
You can leave the images open in Photoshop, save and close them, or (much safer) 
save them to another folder, preserving the originals. Figure 16-6 shows the Batch 
dialog box and also the pop-up menu for the fields in the File Naming area. (When 
you select a new folder as the Destination in Batch, you must tell Photoshop how 
you want the new files to be named.)
You must remember three things when assigning filenames:
»
» Include a variable. Something must change from filename to filename. Select 
one of the top nine items in the File Naming section’s pop-up menu (some 
version of the original document name or a serial number or a serial letter). It 
doesn’t have to be in the first field, but one element of the filename must be 
different from file to file.
»
» Don’t use a period (.) in any field. You can type in any of the fields (except 
the last one you use), but for compatibility, stick with letters, numbers, 
underscores (_), and hyphens (-).

CHAPTER 16  Streamlining Your Work in Photoshop     349
Absolutely do not use a period (.) in the filename. The only period that should 
be used in a filename is the one that’s automatically added immediately 
before the file extension. Including a period earlier in a filename may make 
that file unrecognizable for some programs.
»
» You have two other decisions of note in the Batch dialog box. When you 
elect to suppress any Open commands in the Action, you protect yourself 
from poorly recorded Actions that start by opening the image with which they 
were recorded. However, if the Action depends on the content of a second 
file, you don’t want to override that Open command. Generally, you want to 
override any Save As commands recorded in the Action, relying instead on 
the decisions that you make in the Batch dialog box to determine the fate of 
the image.
Keep in mind that you can also select some of the images in a folder in Bridge, 
and then choose Tools ➪ Photoshop ➪ Batch from Bridge’s main menu to run an 
Action on just those files. The Source menu will be set to Bridge.
Find It Fast with Search
New in Photoshop CC 2017 is the Edit ➪ Search feature, which you can use to find a 
variety of items. (See Figure 16-7.) You can search for features within Photoshop, 
use the Learn link to search Help and tutorials, and Stock to look for images in the 
Adobe Stock collection. Much to the annoyance of some Photoshop users who do a 
lot of work with filters, Search has been assigned the ⌘  +F (Control+F in Windows). 
Reapplying the last-used filter now uses the shortcut ⌘  +Option+F (Control+Alt+F 
in Windows). And that, of course, messes up the shortcuts that open the last-used 
FIGURE 16-6: 
The Batch 
­command is 
much simpler 
than it looks!

350     PART 4  Power Photoshop
filter’s dialog box. On Mac, add the Control key; Windows doesn’t (at this time) 
have a comparable shortcut. However, if you go to Edit ➪ Keyboard Shortcuts, you 
can switch the Last Filter’s shortcut back to ⌘  +F (Control+F in Windows), you can 
open the last used filter dialog box by adding the Option/Alt key.
Creating Contact Sheets and Presentations
Presentations and contact sheets are great for showing off your work. Rather than 
opening an image, showing it, closing, then opening the next image, you have 
them in a simple presentation format or, with contact sheets, multiple images 
on a single page. (Contact sheets are also great for printing multiple images on a 
single sheet of paper.)
Creating a PDF presentation
Portable Document Format (PDF), the native file format of Adobe Acrobat, is an 
incredibly useful and near-universal format. It’s hard to find a computer that 
doesn’t have Adobe Reader or another PDF-reading program (such as the Mac’s 
Preview), and that helps make PDF a wonderful format for sharing or distributing 
your images.
You can quickly and easily create both on-screen presentations (complete with 
fancy transitions between images) and multipage PDF documents (suitable for 
distribution and printing) by choosing File ➪ Automate ➪ PDF Presentation. (See 
Figure 16-8.)
To create a PDF presentation or a multipage PDF in Photoshop, take the 
following steps:
1.	 If the files you want to use aren’t already open in Photoshop, click the 
Browse button. You can click and then Shift+click to select a series of 
images or ⌘  +click (Mac)/Ctrl+click (Windows) to select individual images.
Hint: You must select the individual images; you can’t select only the folder.
After you click the Open button, the filenames appear in the PDF Presentation 
window. Drag filenames up or down to reorder them.
FIGURE 16-7: 
Some folks will

CHAPTER 16  Streamlining Your Work in Photoshop     351
If, for example, you have a number of images open in Photoshop and select 
the Add Open Files and the files don’t open in order of filename, you can click 
the new Sort By Name button to re-sort the files in the left column.
2.	 In the Output Options area, you can elect to create an on-screen presen-
tation or a multipage document.
You can choose to have a white, gray, or black background and what file-
related information you want on each slide or page. Electing to include the 
filename (and perhaps your copyright information) is a good idea when 
sending images to someone who needs to know the image name, say, to order 
prints and give you cash for them. A multipage PDF is an excellent way to share 
a large number of images; a presentation is a great way to show off your work.
3.	 Select how you want the presentation to play.
You can have the presentation automatically switch images after a given 
number of seconds (or opt for manual slide advance), you can have the 
presentation automatically rewind and begin playing again (loop), or you can 
pick transitions between images. Do your audience a favor and pick a single 
transition and stick with it — preferably one simple transition, such as Wipe 
Left or Wipe Right. Those too-busy transitions are the 21st-century version of 
PowerPoint clip art — fun to play with, but distracting to your audience.
4.	 Click the Save button.
You see the Save dialog box, from which you pick a location and a name and 
then click another Save button.
5.	 In the Save Adobe PDF dialog box, make things simple for yourself and 
choose Smallest File Size or High Quality Print from the Adobe PDF Preset 
pop-up menu at the top.
If you’re creating a presentation or want to create a multipage PDF from  
which the recipient can’t print full-size images, choose Smallest File Size. For a 
FIGURE 16-8: 
PDF is a 
great format 
for sharing 
images as 
­presentations 
or as 
­documents.

352     PART 4  Power Photoshop
multipage document from which you do want the client to print great images, 
use High Quality Print.
6.	 The only other area of the dialog box that you really need to consider is 
Security.
You can assign a password to the file that the recipient needs in order to open 
and view the presentation or multipage PDF document. Alternatively, you can 
require no password to open the file, but rather assign a password for printing 
or changing the file.
7.	 At the end of the road, click the Save PDF button to actually generate the 
final file.
Do you ever get annoyed by the fact that Photoshop prints only one image at a 
time? Are there times when you’d like to send a bunch of images to print at the 
same time, perhaps overnight or while you’re at lunch? Create a multipage PDF 
from the images and print through Adobe Reader or Acrobat, or other programs 
that can work with multipage PDFs, such as the Mac’s Preview.
Collecting thumbnails in a contact sheet
In the old Dark(room) Ages, photographers regularly made a record of which 
images were on which film strips by exposing those strips on a piece of photo-
graphic paper, thus creating a contact sheet (the film strips were in contact with 
the sheet of paper). The contact sheet serves the same purpose as thumbnails or 
previews in Bridge or the Open dialog box or thumbnail images on a web page — 
they show which image is which. Hard copy contact sheets are useful to present 
to a client. You can have Photoshop automate the process for you by choosing 
File ➪ Automate ➪ Contact Sheet II. (See Figure 16-9.) The procedure is as follows:
1.	 Select a source folder from the Use drop-down list in the Source Images 
area.
2.	 (Optional) If you want to include the images in any subfolders that might 
be within that folder, select the Include Subfolders check box.
The Group Images by Folder option starts a new contact sheet for each 
subfolder.
3.	 Using the Units, Width, and Height options in the Document area, 
describe your document, using the printable area of your page — not  
the paper size.
4.	 Select a resolution.
I recommend 300 pixels per inch (ppi) if printing and 72 ppi if you’ll be slicing 
the image for your website (although resolution really doesn’t matter for most 
web browsers).

CHAPTER 16  Streamlining Your Work in Photoshop     353
5.	 Use the Mode drop-down list box to choose a color profile (an RGB profile 
unless printing to a color laser printer) and also decide whether you want 
to flatten all layers (which makes a smaller but less versatile file).
You can choose to have the images added to the page row by row (the second image 
is to the right of the first) or column by column (the second image is directly below 
the first). You can also choose the number of rows and columns, which determines 
the size of each individual image. You then need to decide whether to use auto-
spacing, to calculate the spacing between images, and whether to rotate images. If 
your source folder has a mixture of landscape and portrait images, rotating makes 
sure that each is exactly the same size — although some will be sideways. If image 
orientation is more important than having identical sizes, don’t use the Rotate 
for Best Fit option. Note in Figure 16-10 that the filenames change size to match 
the size of the image and, as you can see at the far right of the second row, if the 
filename is too long, it gets truncated rather than shrinking to an unreadable size. 
When you have elected to include filenames as captions, Contact Sheet II lets you 
choose any font installed on your computer for the filenames.

of your images,

Sheet II.

354     PART 4  Power Photoshop
If your folder is filled with portrait-oriented images, you can certainly have more 
columns than rows so that each image better fills the area allotted for it. For 
example, when printing 20 portrait images, using five columns and four rows 
produces larger printed images than using four columns and five rows.
Scanning Multiple Photos in One Pass
You can often save a lot of time by placing multiple photos on the glass of your 
scanner and scanning them all at once. You don’t need to reopen the scanner 
software or generate a new preview every time; rather, you just scan one big pic-
ture and make individual little pictures from it later in Photoshop. Photoshop’s 
File ➪ Automate menu offers a neat timesaving feature named Crop and Straighten 
Photos, which generates a separate file for each photo it finds in the scan.
For best results, place the photos on the scanner’s bed with a slight gap between 
them. I like to place a sheet of colored paper or plastic on top of the photos, between 
the backs of the photos and the scanner’s lid. (See Figure 16-11.) I use paper or plas-
tic that is a very different color from any color found along the edges of the photos. 
This gives Photoshop a good idea about where each photo ends and the next begins.
After the scan is complete and the image is open in Photoshop, choose File ➪  
Automate ➪ Crop and Straighten Photos. No dialog box, no submenus — just select 
the command and wait a few seconds while Photoshop identifies the ­individual 
scanned images and creates a separate file for each.

CHAPTER 16  Streamlining Your Work in Photoshop     355
Sticking to the Script
You can use AppleScript (Mac), Visual Basic (Windows), and JavaScript (both) with 
Photoshop. Scripts are much more powerful than Photoshop’s Actions because 
they can control elements outside of Photoshop itself. AppleScripts and Visual 
Basic scripts can even run multiple programs and play JavaScripts. You can find 
plenty of information to get you started in books and videos available on the web.
If you shoot in your camera’s Raw format, perhaps the most useful of the 
­several  pre-recorded scripts installed with Photoshop is Image Processor. (See  
Figure 16-12.) Choose File ➪ Scripts ➪ Image Processor to batch-convert your Raw 
images to JPEG, PSD, or TIFF — and you can even resize the images automatically 
while converting! (And while Image Processor is designed to work with Raw files, 
you can actually convert any file format that Photoshop can open.)
Image Processor is much simpler than it appears:
»
» Select the images to process. If the images are already open in Photoshop, 
great! If not, click the button and select a folder of images. If the source folder 
has subfolders and you want to process the images in those subfolders, select 
that option.
»
» Choose a destination. You can save the files in the folder of origination (and 
even maintain the subfolder structure), or you can click the button and select 
a different folder in which to save the processed images.
FIGURE 16-11:

and Straighten

356     PART 4  Power Photoshop
Do not click the Select Folder button and select the source folder. If you want 
to keep the processed images in the same folder as the unprocessed images, 
simply click the Save in Same Location button. Photoshop is smart enough — 
most of the time — to recognize the source folder and avoid reprocessing 
already processed images in an endless loop, but don’t risk it.
»
» Select the file format and options. Each of the three file formats offers the 
option of resizing. JPEG offers options for Quality (the amount of compression — 
and associated image degradation) and to convert to sRGB (for the web or 
e-mail). Maximizing compatibility for PSD files ensures that the image can be  
seen and opened by other programs of the Creative Cloud and earlier versions  
of Photoshop. TIFF’s LZW compression can significantly reduce file size, without 
degrading the image at all.
At the bottom of the Image Processor dialog box are also the options to run an 
Action on the images as they’re processed, to add your copyright information to 
the file’s metadata (not on the image itself), and to embed the color profile in the 
image.
Note also the Save and Load buttons. If you set up a couple of folders, one where 
you dump the originals and another where you save from Image Processor, you 
can save your usual setup and load it whenever you need to repeat the job.

Working with Video 
and Animation
J
ust about every new digital camera and smart phone has the capability to 
capture video (with or without audio). Photoshop has some rather impressive 
tools that enable you to handle most of the movie making tasks that a digital 
photographer or designer might need, and in an easy-to-use interface.
In this chapter, I’ll introduce you to the basics of working with imported video. 
You’ll also read about creating animations in Photoshop. But remember that Pho-
toshop is an image-editing program and not a full-blown movie-making suite. 
If you find that your motion picture dreams and aspirations can’t be fulfilled by 
Photoshop, consider Adobe Premiere (or the quite-capable Premiere Elements for 
those on a budget) and perhaps Adobe After Effects.
Importing and Enhancing Video Clips
The heart of Photoshop’s video capabilities is the Timeline panel. You also have 
the 12 commands of the Layer ➪ Video Layers menu, a special Motion workspace, 
and even a set of Actions named, appropriately, Video Actions, all designed to 
make your work with video both easier and more precise.

Getting video into Photoshop
Getting ready to work with video 
in Photoshop is as easy as open-
ing any file into Photoshop. Choose 
File ➪ Open, select the video file, click 
OK, and you’re on your way! (An open 
video in the Timeline panel is visible 
in Figure 17-1.) If you want to restrict 
the list of files in a folder to only video 
(or only audio) formats, select Video 
(or Audio) in the Enable menu at the 
bottom of the Open dialog box. You 
can also create a video project start-
ing with one of Photoshop’s video 
presets in the File ➪ New dialog box. 
Photoshop supports dozens of video, 
audio, and still image file formats 
with which you can create your cin-
ematic masterpieces.
After you have your project started, whether from an existing video file or a 
new document, you have a couple of options for adding additional clips, tracks, 
and images:
»
» Click the plus button at the right end of the existing video (or audio) 
track in the Timeline panel. You’ll add an additional segment to the end of 
that track. (The plus button is visible at the right end of each track in Figure 17-2.) 
You’ll navigate to and select the file in the Add Media dialog box, comparable 
to the Open dialog box, and it will be added at the end of the existing seg-
ment. (You can easily add transitions between the segments, as described 
later in this chapter.)
»
» Click the button to the right of the video group name and select Add 
Media. This button also opens the Add Media dialog box.
»
» Create a new video layer. Choose Layer ➪ Video Layers ➪ New Video Layer 
from File, which also opens the Add Video Layer dialog box.
»
» Copy/paste from another open file. If you have several segments on a track, 
the pasted media will be added after the highlighted segment, rather than at 
the end of the track.
»
» Place a file. Use the File ➪ Place command to add media as a Smart Object to 
the selected track. If no track is selected, the Smart Object is added outside 
the existing video group.
FIGURE 17-1: 
You can open a video file or create a new project.

CHAPTER 17  Working with Video and Animation     359
Using either of the first two techniques or the Place command to add a new seg-
ment automatically assigns the added file’s name to the segment in the Timeline 
panel and to the layer in the Layers panel. Creating or pasting media uses the next 
sequential layer number in both the Layers panel and the Timeline panel.
When you open a video file, Photoshop automatically creates Video Group 1  in 
both the Layers panel and the Timeline panel, as you can see in Figure 17-2. Video 
groups not only help keep the content of the panels manageable, they also enable 
you to work with multiple tracks simultaneously. When you create a new docu-
ment and paste or place media, you can manually create video groups through the 
button to the left of a track in the Timeline panel.
As you can see in Figure 17-2, segments in different video groups and layers out-
side of groups can overlap in the timeline. Much like creating an inanimate image 
using layers in Photoshop, the position on canvas, along with the layer opacity 
and blending mode, determine how the elements in the Timeline panel interact. 
The playhead, the blue slider at the top of the timeline whose position is also indi-
cated by the vertical red line, shows what frame of the video is visible on-screen 
at any given moment.
You can scale the timeline in the Timeline panel using the slider in the middle at 
the bottom of the Timeline panel. Drag to the left to see more of the timeline; drag 
to the right to zoom in and work with precision.

Adjusting the length of  
video and audio clips
After clips are added to the Timeline panel, you can change each segment’s length, 
start point, end point, and the order of play by dragging. Position the cursor in 
the middle of a clip and drag to rearrange the order of segments on a track. You 
can also change the order in which segments play within a video group by chang-
ing the stacking order in the Layers panel. Click the start or end of a segment and 
drag to “trim,” changing what part of the segment plays. The cursor changes to 
a square bracket with a two-headed arrow when positioned over either end of a 
segment, as shown in Figure 17-3 on the upper video segment. (The video within 
the segment to the left of the new start point or, in this example, to the right of 
the new end point is not deleted — you can later drag the start and end points to 
change what part of that segment that plays.) For precision, you can also drag the 
playhead to a specific point on the timeline and right-click the playhead or use 
the Timeline panel’s menu commands to trim or assign the start or end point for 
a segment.
Likewise, you can adjust the start and end points of audio tracks and audio seg-
ments. Use the Plus button at the right end of the audio track to add another audio 
segment to that track, or click the musical note button to the left of the track to 
add another audio track. You can add music and other audio in a variety of formats 
to Photoshop’s Timeline panel. (I don’t need to remind you that recorded music, 
just like your own photographs, is copyrighted material, right?) Click the gray 
arrow button at the right end of the audio segment to open the Audio fly-out panel 
(visible in Figure 17-3), in which you can elect to have the audio fade in and/or 
out, as well as set the volume for that audio segment.
The start and end of the work area, which determine what part of the entire 
video  will play, can also be set by right-clicking the playhead or through the 
panel’s menu. Alternatively, set the work area by dragging the sliders to the left 
and right ends of the timeline, visible in Figure 17-3 at the ends of the timeline at 
00 and 45:00.

CHAPTER 17  Working with Video and Animation     361
Adding adjustment layers and  
painting on video layers
Adjustment layers, not surprisingly, can be added to a video production through 
the Layers panel or the Layer menu. As with regular layers, an adjustment layer is 
applied to all video layers below the adjustment layer and within the video group. 
An adjustment layer can be clipped to a single video layer by Option/Alt+clicking 
in the Layers panel on the line between the adjustment layer and the video layer 
immediately below. You might, for example, want one segment of a track to appear 
as grayscale by adding a Black & White adjustment layer in the Layers panel and 
clipping it to the video layer below it.
You can use many of Photoshop’s painting tools when working with video, includ-
ing the Brush tool and the Clone Stamp tool. Unless you have a problem on one 
specific frame of video, you’ll want to consider working on a new layer. Keep 
in mind that there’s a major difference between adding a regular layer (choose 
Layer ➪ New ➪ Layer) and adding a new video layer (choose Layer ➪ Video Lay-
ers ➪ New Blank Video Layer). A video layer has frames, just like a video captured 
by a camera, whereas a regular layer is static — its appearance remains the same 
for whatever duration you specify in the Timeline panel.
Say, for example, that you had a dust speck or a water spot on your lens when 
capturing video (not that that ever happens). Working with a still image in Photo-
shop, you might simply use the Clone Stamp to cover that unsightly set of pixels 
with other nearby pixels. Say also that you captured, oh, maybe three minutes of 
high-definition video. At 30 frames per second. For a total of 5,400 frames. That’s 
a lot of cloning.
If you clone on the video layer itself or on a new video layer, you’ll need to do 
each frame individually. Instead, if the area is rather similar in each frame, you 
can add a new regular layer above the problematic video segment and, on the 
Options bar, set the Clone Stamp tool to sample the current layer and the layer 
immediately below. Clone once, covering the despicable speck or spot on the new 
layer, and then in the Timeline panel, drag the “start” and “end” points for that 
layer to match those of the video segment. (See Figure 17-4.) When played back or 
rendered, the cloned area covers the flaw on the video layer — every frame fixed 
with a single clone! (Remember to set the playhead at the beginning of the video 
segment that needs fixing before Option/Alt+clicking with the Clone Stamp tool to 
set the source point.)

362     PART 4  Power Photoshop
Transitioning, titling, and  
adding special effects
When working with multiple video segments, you’ll generally want your movie to 
smoothly blend from one clip to another with a transition. Photoshop’s Timeline 
panel offers a number of built-in transitions that you can drag between segments 
on a single track. Click the button immediately to the left of the timeline in the 
Timeline panel, select the transition, specify the duration for the transition, and 
then drag the transition onto the track between the two video segments. (See 
­Figure 17-5.) When played back or rendered, the two video segments blend into 
each other using the selected transition for the specified duration.
Adding a title to the beginning of your cinematic extravaganza (and, of course, 
your name in the Director and Producer credits at the end) is as easy as adding a 
type layer and specifying the layer’s duration in the Timeline panel. You can also 
add shapes to a video with the various shape tools, just as you would in any other 
artwork.
To add some spice to your titles and shapes, consider using keyframes to con-
trol the opacity, position, and even size of the type layer. A keyframe is a marker 
in the timeline that specifies when a specific event begins and ends. You might, 
for instance, want the title of your movie to fade in quickly, remain on-screen 
while the first frames of the video play in the background, and then slowly fade 
away. (To get such an effect, you’d set your keyframes as shown in Figure 17-6.)
FIGURE 17-4: 
The “regular” 
layer will be

entire duration 
of the video 
segment 
below it.

CHAPTER 17  Working with Video and Animation     363
Visible in the timeline in Figure 17-6 are the diamonds that represent keyframes, 
which I created using these steps:
1.	 Add the type layer. Select the Type tool, specify the font, size, and other 
attributes on the Options bar or Character panel; click in the image 
window and type your text. End the text editing session by clicking the 
check mark at the right end of the Options bar, by changing tools, or by 
pressing ⌘  +Return or Ctrl+Enter.
In the Layers panel, make sure that the type layer is above your video layers 
and outside any video group.
2.	 Position the type layer. Drag the type layer into the position in the image 
window where you want it to first appear.
You’ll also want to drag the left edge of the layer in the Timeline panel to the 
position along the timeline where you first want it to appear.
3.	 Specify the duration. Click the right edge of the type layer segment in the 
Timeline panel and drag to the point where you want the title completely 
gone from the screen.
4.	 Expand the options for that track. Click the triangle to the left of the type 
layer’s name in the left column of the Timeline panel.
The options are expanded in Figure 17-6.
5.	 Add the first opacity keyframe. Position the playhead at the beginning of 
the title segment, and then click the stopwatch button to the left of the 
word Opacity.
That adds the first keyframe at the playhead position.
6.	 Set the opacity in the Layers panel.
In this example, because we want the title to fade in, set the layer’s Opacity to 0%.
7.	 Set the second keyframe. Move the playhead to the point in the timeline 
where you want the title to be completely visible. Click the diamond-
shaped button between the arrows to the left of Opacity in the left 
column of the Timeline panel.
FIGURE 17-6: 
Use keyframes 
to specify start 
and end points 
of special 
effects.

364     PART 4  Power Photoshop
Keep in mind that you can switch the Timeline Unit between Frame Number 
and Timecode in the Timeline panel’s options, which you access through the 
panel’s menu.
8.	Set the opacity in the Layers panel. So that the type layer is completely 
visible, set the Opacity to 100%.
9.	Add the next keyframe. Drag the playhead to the point in the timeline 
where you want the title to start fading out, and then click the diamond-
shaped button to add the keyframe.
10.	Set the Opacity. Well, okay, we want the opacity still set to 100% at this 
point, so you don’t need to change the Opacity in the Layers panel after all.
If, however, you want a different opacity value at this keyframe, you can set the 
opacity as desired in the Layers panel.
11.	Add the last keyframe. Move the playhead to the right end of the title 
segment and click the diamond-shaped button to add the last keyframe.
12.	Reduce the opacity. In the Layers panel, set the Opacity field back to zero.
Drag the playhead to the beginning (or click the button in the upper-left corner of 
the Timeline panel), and then click the Play button to preview. Your title will fade 
in between the first pair of keyframes, remain at 100% opacity between the second 
and third keyframes, and then fade out between the third and fourth keyframes. 
Whatever other tracks you have in the Timeline continue to play.
Notice that you have several other keyframe-controlled options for the type layer 
in the left column of the Timeline panel. You could, perhaps, use keyframes to 
control a text warp, perhaps an arc or bulge. You could also use keyframes in 
conjunction with Photoshop’s Edit ➪ Transform commands to control the appear-
ance of the type layer. You might, for example, use the Scale command to make 
your type layer go from a size of two or three points to filling the entire image 
window, making it appear to zoom in from a distance. Using keyframes to control 
the Transform ➪ Rotate command can make the type layer spin over time. And, of 
course, these effects can be used in conjunction with each other, so the title could 
zoom in from a distance, while spinning and fading in to 100% opacity. (Click the 
triangle to the left of a video group in the left column of the Timeline panel and 
you’ll see the keyframe-controlled options for video tracks.)
Transforming video layers
So, how about transforming video clips, scaling or rotating a video segment for 
special effects? Simply convert a video group or video layer to a Smart Object by 
selecting it in the Layers panel and choosing Layer ➪ Smart Objects ➪ Convert to 
Smart Object.

CHAPTER 17  Working with Video and Animation     365
Keep in mind, too, that after converting a video group or video layer to a Smart 
Object, you can work with Smart Filters. Consider, if you will, a video clip cap-
tured under low-light conditions at high ISO. After adding your Curves or Levels 
adjustment layer to lighten up the video segment, you may find an unacceptable 
amount of digital noise. You could use the Reduce Noise filter, click the Next Frame 
button, use the Reduce Noise filter, click the Next Frame button, and use the — 
well, you get the idea. Instead, convert the video layer to a Smart Object and apply 
the Reduce Noise filter as a Smart Filter, reducing noise in all frames of the video 
segment. (Reduce Noise is just one example of Smart Filters that can be effectively 
used with video clips.)
The Timeline panel also has some nifty effects built right in, including Pan, Zoom, 
Rotate, and the combinations Pan & Zoom and Rotate & Zoom. These effects are 
applied to any video or other layer through the Motion fly-out panel, which you open 
by clicking the small gray arrow at the right end of a segment in the Timeline panel.
But what if you want to apply the effect to only a portion of a video segment? 
Position the playhead at the point where you want to make a change and click the 
Split at Playhead button (to the left of the Transitions button in the left column 
of the Timeline panel) or use the panel’s menu command of the same name. The 
segment is divided at that point. If the video layer is within a video group in the 
Layers panel, it’s simply divided into two segments. If the video layer is outside 
a video group, the portion to the right of the playhead is cut to a separate video 
track. If you split a Smart Object, you’ll create a pair of Smart Objects, both with 
any Smart Filters that had already been applied.
Rendering and exporting video
You’ve added all of the video tracks, dragged transitions between segments, cre-
ated a title with keyframe-controlled special effects, and adjusted your audio to 
perfection. Now what? Save the file in the PSD file format to preserve all of your 
editing options, of course. But to actually use the video in any other program, or to 
share it with others, you’ll need to use Photoshop’s File ➪ Export ➪ Render Video 
command.
You select a filename and location in the top section of the Render Video dialog 
box. In the middle section, elect to use Adobe Media Encoder to create a video. 
(You also have the Photoshop Image Sequence option to create a still image from 
each frame of the video.) Your video file format options include QuickTime (great 
for video on a variety of platforms), H.264 (a standard for high-definition video), 
and DPX (digital picture exchange, often used for video that will be further pro-
cessed in another program). Each format offers a variety of presets. QuickTime, 
for example, lets you select a compression scheme and enables you to change 

366     PART 4  Power Photoshop
the dimensions and frame rate of the final video. With H.264 selected, the Pre-
sets menu includes device-specific output settings for iPads, iPhones, Android 
phones and tablets, a variety of high-definition TV standards, NTSC, PAL, and 
even YouTube.
Near the bottom of the Render Video dialog box, you’ll have the option of specify-
ing a range of frames, if you don’t want to render the entire video. If your mas-
terpiece includes an alpha channel (QuickTime only) or 3D objects, you’ll also be 
able to specify how those elements are rendered.
After clicking the Render button, Photoshop will export the video in the selected 
format, with the selected presets, using the selected filename and location. How 
long it takes to export the video depends on a number of things, including your 
hardware, the length of the video, and the preset selected.
Creating Animations in Photoshop
In addition to timeline video, Photoshop provides everything you need to create 
frame-based animation for use on web pages and in presentations.
Building frame-based animations
Although it is certainly possible to start with a video clip or even a photo when 
creating a frame-based animation, you may find such projects are better suited 
to shapes and text. You can certainly export a frame-based animation as a Quick-
Time video, but to post on your website, you’re more likely to use Save for Web to 
generate an animated GIF. (Remember that the GIF file format uses a color table 
limited to no more than 256 colors, so it’s not generally appropriate for photo-
graphic or other continuous-tone images.)
Prior to generating the individual frames of your animation, you’ll usually want to 
create all of the elements from which those frames will be created. Keeping each 
element on a separate layer makes frame creation a very simple process. After you 
have all of the elements you’ll need, open the Timeline panel through Photoshop’s 
Window menu and take a look at the lower-left corner of the panel. If you see the 
word Once or Forever with a downward-pointing arrow to the right, you’re ready 
to get started. If you see a button with three little boxes lined up horizontally like 
(ready for it?) frames in a movie, click the button to switch the panel from video 
timeline to frame animation. (If, for another project, you need to reconfigure the 
Timeline panel for video timeline, click the button in the lower-left corner.)

CHAPTER 17  Working with Video and Animation     367
In a nutshell, here’s how you create a frame-based animation in Photoshop:
1.	 Show/hide layers in the Layers panel. Set the Layer panel content to 
show those elements you want visible in the first frame of the animation.
If you want the animation to start with an empty screen, hide all the layers.
2.	 Click the New Frame button.
Below the frames in the Timeline panel are a number of buttons. The New 
Frame button is second from the right, next to the Trash icon (which is used, 
naturally enough, to delete frames).
3.	 Rearrange the content of the Layers panel.
Show/hide layers, move layer content, and otherwise rearrange the image 
window to set it the way you want for the second frame.
4.	 Repeat as desired.
Click the New Frame button, rearrange the items, click the New Frame button, 
rearrange, and so on until you have all of the frames you want for your 
animation.
5.	 Use Save for Web to create an animated GIF or export as a QuickTime 
movie.
And you’re done! (Make sure to save the layered document in the PSD file 
format, just in case you want to make changes or use some of the elements in 
another animation down the road.)
Creating frame content
If each frame of the animation was identical, there would be no reason to cre-
ate an animation — it would appear to be a still image. So, from frame to frame, 
something is usually different to provide the change-over-time that’s the basis 
for animation. Among the changes you can make in the Layers panel to change the 
appearance of the animation from frame to frame are
»
» Layer visibility: You can show or hide the content of a layer.
»
» Layer opacity: By changing a layer’s opacity from frame to frame, you can 
make the content of the layer fade in or fade out as the animation plays.
»
» Change position: You can use the Move tool to drag items around on a layer, 
making them seem to move from frame to frame.

368     PART 4  Power Photoshop
»
» Change blending mode: Changing a layer’s blending mode changes the way 
that layer’s content interacts with the content of layers below from frame to 
frame.
»
» Add, remove, or change a layer style: Consider, for example, a round shape 
with a Bevel layer style that changes, making the object appear to inflate and 
deflate from frame to frame.
In the Timeline panel shown in Figure 17-7, you can see how a simple animation 
can be created by adding a frame, moving the content of the two layers, adding 
another frame, dragging the objects again, and so on.
Tweening to create intermediary frames
To create the animation in Figure 17-7, I actually only created 3 of the 13 frames. 
I let Photoshop do the other 10 frames, saving me time and ensuring that the 
animation would play smoothly and precisely. I created the first frame, with the 
red circle in the upper-left corner and the blue square in the lower-right. I then 
clicked the New Frame button and dragged the red circle to the lower-left and 
the blue square to the upper-right. After clicking the New Frame button again, 
I dragged the red circle to the lower-right (where the blue square started) and 
dragged the blue square to the upper-left (where the red circle started).
FIGURE 17-7:

course of the

CHAPTER 17  Working with Video and Animation     369
After creating my three frames, Photo-
shop tweened pairs of frames to create 
the intermediary frames. Tweening 
creates the frames in between two 
frames in the Timeline panel. I clicked 
the first frame, and then opened the 
Timeline panel menu and selected 
the Tween command. In the Tween 
dialog box (see Figure 17-8), you can 
specify how many frames to gener-
ate (I choose five), what aspects of 
the frames you want to blend (I only 
needed to tween for position because 
there were no changes to opacity or 
layer styles), and whether to tween 
between the selected frame and the 
next frame or the last frame (I chose Next Frame). I then clicked the second frame 
I created (frame number 7 at that point, second from last) and repeated the Tween 
process.
Say that, on your home page, you want a logo to fade out and fade in repeat-
edly, and you want each fade to be extremely smooth. You could create the logo, 
set the layer opacity to 100%, add a new frame, reduce the opacity to 99%, add 
a new frame, reduce the opacity to 98%, and repeat over and over again until 
you reached 0% opacity. Or you could create the logo at 100% opacity, click the 
New Frame button, reduce the opacity to 0%, click the first frame, and use the 
Tween command to generate 99 more frames, tweening for opacity. Add another 
frame, return the opacity to 99% (your original first frame is at 100%), and then 
tween 98 new frames between the second-to-last frame and the newly-created 
last frame. Your choice. . .
Specifying frame rate
You control how fast (or slowly) your animation plays by specifying a frame rate. 
Generally, each frame plays for the same amount of time, so you can click the 
first frame, Shift+click the last, and select the frame rate of your choice from 
the menu below any one of the frames. (See Figure 17-9.) If you select No Delay 
(0.00 seconds), the animation plays as fast as possible. Don’t overlook the Other 
option! You’re not restricted to the time delays listed in the menu.
FIGURE 17-8: 
Photoshop generated 10 of the 13 frames 
automatically.

370     PART 4  Power Photoshop
Keep in mind that not all frames need to have the same playback rate. Consider, if 
you will, the example of the logo that fades in and out on your home page in the 
previous section of this chapter. There’s no reason why the 100% opacity frame 
couldn’t be set to a five or ten second delay, with all of the other frames set to 1 10 
of a second.
In the lower-left corner of the Timeline panel, you’ll also want to select the repeat 
for the animation. You can elect to have the animation play once and then stop, to 
continuously loop (Forever), or you can choose any other number of times for the 
animation to play in a loop by selecting Other.
Optimizing and saving your animation
If you’ll be adding your animation to a web page or a presentation created in Key-
note or PowerPoint, you’ll want to generate an animated GIF. (Keep in mind that 
if there’s no layer named Background in the Layers panel, your animated GIF can 
support transparency.) After generating all of the frames, open the Timeline panel 
menu and select the Optimize Animation command. The default settings — with 
Bounding Box and Redundant Pixel Removal both selected — will generate the 
smallest file, ensuring the smoothest playback. Save the layered and animated file 
in the PSD file format for future use, and then choose File ➪ Save for Web to create 
the animated GIF. (Remember to select the Transparency option in Save for Web 
if you don’t have a background layer.)
If you want to use your animation with devices that don’t play animated GIFs — a 
smartphone, for example — choose File ➪ Export ➪ Render Video to generate a 
QuickTime movie.

Ten Specialized Features 
of Photoshop CC
F
rom Photoshop CS3 through Photoshop CS6 there were two versions of 
Photoshop, the “Standard” version and the “Extended” version. The Extended 
version included specialized features for working with 3D, video (added to 
Standard in CS6), and technical features. Starting with Photoshop CC, there is only 
one version, incorporating all the special features, no more “Extended” version.
For years, Adobe has heard the pleas of researchers, scientists, and other highly 
specialized users of Photoshop to include features that fulfill their needs. As I 
explain, these extended features don’t really have a place in the workflow of most 
Photoshop users. That doesn’t mean that you’ll never use any of these features! 
You might find a need to calculate a height or a distance using the measuring tools 
in Vanishing Point, or perhaps use the Count tool. As a photographer, you may 
find that a couple of the Smart Object stack modes can be used to solve a couple of 
photographic challenges. And who can resist the temptation to play around with 
3D? Figure 18-1 shows the 3D panel and menu commands.
In this chapter, I introduce you to the various special features of Photoshop that 
were formerly in the Extended version only. This chapter won’t get you fully up 
to speed on how to work with the features; instead, it’s meant to quench your 
curiosity about those features designed for specialists and scientists rather than 
photographers and designers.
Chapter 18

374     PART 5  The Part of Tens
Using Smart Object Stack Modes
Working with Photoshop CC, you can combine a number of images into a single 
stack as a Smart Object. Within the pile of images, you can determine how the 
pixels in each interact with those in the others. Select several related or contrast-
ing images and add them as layers to a single image, select the layers, and cre-
ate a Smart Object by choosing Layer ➪ Smart Objects ➪ Convert to Smart Object. 
Return to the Layer ➪ Smart Object submenu and take a look at the Stack Modes 
submenu that’s now available. These options determine how the content on the 
layers within the Smart Object interact to produce the appearance of the Smart 
Object itself. (Not quite the same, but similar to the way layer-blending modes 
help determine the overall appearance of your artwork.) You can find technical 
explanations of each option in Photoshop’s Help, but I show a couple of stacks as 
examples. On the left in Figure 18-2, you see a combination of the layers (shown 
to the left as thumbnails) using the stack mode Summation, which pretty much 
adds up all the lightness of each pixel in each channel, on each layer. To the right, 
several images shot for use with Merge to HDR are combined in a Smart Object 
using the stack mode Mean, which averages the values for each pixel in each 
channel. Not quite Merge to HDR, but with some planning and prep, it could be a 
supplemental technique.
FIGURE 18-1: 
Photoshop CC 
includes 3D 
capabilities.

CHAPTER 18  Ten Specialized Features of Photoshop CC     375
Photographers may also find another great use for stack modes. Using a tripod and 
the same exposure settings, take a number of photos of a static object with mov-
ing objects (people or cars, for example) over a reasonably short period of time 
(minutes, not hours, so the lighting doesn’t change much). Select the thumbnails 
in Bridge and use Bridge’s menu command Tools ➪ Photoshop ➪ Load Files into 
Photoshop Layers. (If you’re not using Bridge, open the first image, then open 
each additional image and drag the layer Background from the Layers panel to 
the first image.) In Photoshop, use the menu command Select ➪ All Layers. (You 
never even noticed that command before? Now you’ll use it all the time.) Unless 
you had a rock-solid tripod, choose Photoshop’s Edit ➪ Auto-Align Layers com-
mand with the Reposition option. Create a Smart Object from the layers by choos-
ing Layers ➪ Smart Objects ➪ Convert to Smart Object. Choose the Median stack 
mode and watch all of those moving objects simply disappear, leaving you with 
just the scene, empty of traffic. Figure 18-3 shows the shots originally taken and 
the resulting image.
If something very prominent or bright in one of the shots doesn’t disappear com-
pletely, go back in the History panel to before you created the Smart Object (the 
Auto-Align Layers step) and delete that particular area from the offending layer, 
re-create the Smart Object, and reselect the Median stack mode.
FIGURE 18-2: 
A couple of 
different 
uses for stack 
modes.

The cars on 
either side of 
the river, the 
bus, and even 
the falling 
snow are

Median.

376     PART 5  The Part of Tens
The Mean Stack Mode
Another use of the stack mode Mean that is of value to photographers is noise 
reduction. Shooting in low light with a high ISO setting can result in images with 
a lot of noise. Using a tripod or bracing the camera, take several shots, perhaps 
using the camera’s burst mode. (This is a great trick for shooting in a museum that 
doesn’t permit flash photography.) Open the files in Photoshop layers through 
Bridge or manually, select all the layers, and align. Create your Smart Object from 
the layers and set the stack mode to Mean to minimize the noise.
Working with 3D Artwork
Photoshop offers lots of 3D capabilities, including 3D extrusions from layers and 
paths, control over the spatial relationships among objects, improved rendering, 
and generally improved performance. Figure  18-4 shows many of the features 
available when working in 3D.
FIGURE 18-4: 
Tools, menus, 
and panels 
specially for 
working in 3D.

CHAPTER 18  Ten Specialized Features of Photoshop CC     377
You can use the tools in the 3D Mode section of the Options bar (to the far right) to 
rotate and roll and drag and slide and scale 3D objects. The 3D panel offers access 
to each of the materials (think “textures”) used with a 3D object, as well as a tab 
on which you add, subtract, or alter lights used in the 3D scene. (Take a look at the 
Lighting Effects filter in Chapter 15 for some info on working with lights.)
Creating 3D objects
Working with a photo or any other 2D artwork, you can create any of a dozen 
different 3D shapes, from simple spheres, cubes, and cones to donuts, hats, and 
wine bottles. (Use the menu command 3D ➪ New Mesh from Layer ➪ Mesh Pre-
set.) Working with a layer that contains areas of transparency, you can extrude 
shapes as well, stretching the layer content backward into a 3D shape. (Use the 
menu command 3D ➪ New 3D Extrusion from Selected Layer.) Active selections on 
a layer and even paths can be used to create extruded objects.
Importing 3D objects
Among the file formats that support 3D that you can open into Photoshop are 3D 
Studio, Collada DAE, Flash 3D, Google Earth 4 KMZ, U3D, and Wavefront|OBJ. Many 
ready-made 3D objects can be downloaded or purchased from various websites, 
including
www.turbosquid.com/photoshop-3d
www.daz3d.com
www.archive3d.net/
You can use Photoshop’s File ➪ Open command, or add a 3D object to an existing 
project by choosing 3D ➪ New 3D Layer from File. And you can find additional 
resources by using 3D ➪ Get More Content.
Rendering and saving 3D scenes
After you have your 3D scene looking just the way you want it to appear as a 2D 
image, use the command 3D ➪ Render, followed by File ➪ Save As, to save in the 
file format of your choice. Photoshop uses the Shadow Quality and Ray Tracer 
High Quality Threshold settings set in the program’s Preferences ➪ 3D.

378     PART 5  The Part of Tens
You can also use the command 3D ➪ Export 3D Layer to save the project in any of 
eight 3D file formats, including Collada DAE, Flash 3D, Google Earth 4 KMZ, 3D 
PDF, STL, U3D, VRML, and Wavefront|OBJ.
If you’re interested in working with 3D in Photoshop, I highly recommend that 
you pick up a copy of a book that goes into more detail on the subject.
Measuring, Counting, and Analyzing Pixels
Designed for researchers and scientists, the measuring capabilities in Photoshop 
are quite powerful. You can measure just about anything and count the number of 
whatevers in a technical image, perhaps from a microscope or telescope.
Measuring length, area, and more
If you know the exact size of any element in an image, you can then discover just 
about anything you want to know about anything else in that image. The key is 
to set the measurement scale, as shown in Figure 18-5. The Measurement Scale 
dialog box opens through the Image ➪ Analysis menu or the Measurement Log’s 
panel menu with the command Set Measurement Scale ➪ Custom.
In this example, we know that the knee is 2.5 inches wide and that the Ruler tool 
(nested in the Toolbox with the Eyedropper) was Shift+dragged over 138 pixels. 
We can, therefore, set the scale to 138 pixels = 2.5 inches. You can add the mea-
surement scale to the image as an editable layer group (visible in the top center) 
with the Image ➪ Analysis ➪ Place Scale Marker command.
FIGURE 18-5: 
Drag a known 
distance; 
set the

CHAPTER 18  Ten Specialized Features of Photoshop CC     379
Using any selection tool, you can isolate any part of the image, click the Record 
Measurements button in the Measurement Log panel (which you open, like any 
panel, through the Window menu), and you’ll find out more than you ever wanted 
to know about that particular selection and its content. In addition to the fields 
visible in Figure 18-5, the Measurement Log can also track (among other things) 
the height, width, area, and perimeter length of the selection, as well as the mini-
mum, maximum, mean, and median gray values within the selection.
After you have made and recorded all the various measurements you need, you can 
select all the lines in the Measurement Log (or only a few) and click the third but-
ton in the upper-right corner of the panel to export the data for use in a spread-
sheet program.
Calculating with Vanishing Point
Photoshop also offers measurement in perspective through Vanishing Point 
(found in the Filter menu). Suppose, for example, you need to calculate how much 
wallpaper to order for the room shown in Figure 18-6. You know the height of the 
window (70 inches) and using that as your known measurement, you can have 
Photoshop calculate the height and length of each wall. Drag the Measure tool 
along the edge of the window and enter the known size (70 inches) in the Length 
field. When you click the four corners of a surface in the image with the Create 
Plane tool, the length of each side is visible in boxes.
FIGURE 18-6:

can also 
be made in

380     PART 5  The Part of Tens
Counting crows or maybe avian flu
Nested with the Ruler tool and the Eyedroppers in the Toolbox is the Count tool. 
Zoom in and start clicking whatever you need to count, whether they’re birds in 
the sky or viruses on a slide. Each item you click is labeled with a number. When 
you want to record the count, click the Record Measurements button in the Mea-
surement Log. You can also record and work with multiple counts. To the right of 
the Count Groups menu on the Options bar (see Figure 18-7) are buttons to show/
hide the currently selected count group, to start a new count group, and to delete 
the current count group. Click the color swatch on the Options bar to select a new 
color for the count group, and you can customize both the size of the circle that 
marks the count and the marker number — individually for each count group.
(Don’t you love the way that Warning symbol in the margin catches your eye?) 
Adjust the marker and label sizes (and select a color) before you start clicking 
around in your image with the Count tool — changing the size after placing your 
count markers can shift them in the image window, destroying your meticulous 
placement.

CHAPTER 19  Ten Reasons to Love Your Wacom Tablet     381
Ten Reasons to Love 
Your Wacom Tablet
D
rawing tablets from Wacom enable you to use a special stylus, which you 
hold like a pen or pencil or brush, to move the cursor (rather than using 
a mouse, track pad, or trackball). Some of Wacom’s models enable you 
to control the cursor with Multi-Touch, much like an iPhone or iPad, and they 
include support for Windows 10. There are several reasons why using a stylus is 
a huge improvement over a mouse, and I give you five to start off the chapter. 
Another five reasons you’ll love your Wacom tablet involve maximizing your effi-
ciency; those reasons conclude the chapter.
More Natural Movement
Whether you use a pen only to sign your name or you’re a traditionally trained 
artist, the movement of a stylus is far more natural than pushing a mouse around 
a desk. 
Chapter 19

382     PART 5  The Part of Tens
Health and Safety
Use of a drawing tablet instead of a mouse can help avoid repetitive stress injuries 
and carpal tunnel syndrome, and can be vastly more comfortable for those who 
suffer from arthritis and tendonitis.
Artistic Control
With up to thousands of levels of sensitivity (wow — I wish my hands had that level 
of sensitivity!), a “click” or a “drag” using a drawing tablet is far more versatile 
than working with a mouse, especially when you’re working with Photoshop’s 
erodible, airbrush, and watercolor brush tips and the Mixer Brush tool (which are 
discussed in Chapter 14). Open the Photoshop Brush Settings palette and take a 
look at some of the six different options that you can control through Pen Pres-
sure, Pen Tilt, or (with the Wacom Airbrush) Stylus Wheel. (See Figure 19-1.) And 
don’t forget about tools that can be directly controlled with pen pressure, such as 
the Quick Selection tool, which can use pen pressure to adjust the brush diameter.
FIGURE 19-1: 
Six of the 
brush settings 
can be

and/or pen tilt.

CHAPTER 19  Ten Reasons to Love Your Wacom Tablet     383
Extended Comfort
You can lean back and relax or sit up straight: With fingers poised over the key-
board or hand grasping mouse, you’re pretty much locked into a single position, 
often for hours at a time. With the long cord of a Wacom tablet plugged into a 
handy USB port or connected wirelessly using Bluetooth technology, you have the 
flexibility to change positions, move back from the monitor, even slouch in a way 
that would make Mom turn pale — all while still sending input to the computer. 
Whether you work with the tablet on the desk or on your lap, it doesn’t matter; do 
whatever is most comfortable and efficient for you.
Gestures, Programmable ExpressKeys, 
Touch Rings, and Touch Strips
Many of the same gestures you use on a trackpad or touchscreen are available with 
a number of Wacom’s tablets. And how about convenient controls, right on the 
tablet, that let you access modifier keys, keyboard shortcuts, and even brush sizes 
and tool selection? No need to lean back in toward the desk to press a key or two; 
just program your most-needed keystrokes to the tablet. Keep in mind, too, that 
the Intuos line is southpaw-friendly — switch the USB cord and all the labels and 
controls conveniently flip over for lefties. You can also customize each of these 
controls and keys. See how in the upcoming section “Setting Preferences.”
The Optimal Tablet
The inexpensive Bamboo series comes in several sizes and a couple of models. The 
Intuos line of tablets come in a variety of specialized versions, some in a couple 
of different sizes. Models are customized for photos, 3D, art, drawing, and even 
creating comics. You use a stylus (pen) to draw on the tablet and what you draw 
appears on your computer screen. Several of the models, including those designed 
for photographers and artists have multi-touch capabilities, enabling you to use 
your fingers on the surface, just as you would on a trackpad. All Intuos models have 
programmable ExpressKeys that can be programmed to perform various functions 
in many programs (including Photoshop). There are also three Pro models in the 
Intuos line that offer more features. The Cintiq line, which I discuss at the end 
of this chapter, has a built-in monitor so you’re actually drawing directly on a 
computer screen. On the top of the heap is the Wacom MobileStudio Pro, which is 
actually an Intel-based computer, available with 13- and 16-inch screens.

384     PART 5  The Part of Tens
If you have a fine-arts background, you might want a larger tablet. (And consider 
the highly specialized Wacom Intuos Pro Paper, which lets you trace over a paper 
sketch or drawing and digitize it.) If you are not a traditionally trained artist, 
you might be more comfortable with a smaller tablet, on which you can make 
smaller strokes. Regardless of what size tablet you have, don’t forget that you 
can zoom in on a specific area of your image while you work. And keep in mind 
that you might also want to have a smaller tablet to slide right into your laptop 
case, too. My current “go to” tablet is the Wacom Intous Pro Medium ($349.95). 
It’s substantially smaller than the previous medium-size tablet, in width, height, 
and thickness — and is barely larger than the old small size. I used to carry the 
small in my laptop case because the medium was too large to take on the road, but 
this new “medium” is small enough to fit in any of my laptop cases along with 
my 15-inch MacBook Pro. That’s the tablet you’ll see in my booth at Photoshop 
World. (Unless, of course, Wacom comes out with something even better between 
now and then.) Or perhaps I’ll shell out a grand for the 13-inch Wacom Cintiq Pro.
The Pen’s Switch
Most (but not all) Wacom pens have a switch, called the DuoSwitch, right on the 
side that (by default) lets you right-click or double-click simply by rocking the 
switch. Rather than tapping the pen twice on the tablet to double-click (which 
could leave two spots of color if the Brush tool is active), simply press the Duo-
Switch’s upper rocker. And, of course, you can program the DuoSwitch to perform 
other functions as well, such as a specific keystroke, a modifier key, and even 
panning and scrolling.
If you find your pen sometimes shows bizarre behavior, go to the tablet’s Prefer-
ences (discussed in the next section) and set the lower switch on the pen to Dis-
abled. As you work, the pen may be rotating in your hand, resulting in unexpected 
clicking of the lower switch.
Setting Preferences
After downloading and installing the latest version of the Wacom driver for your 
tablet, open the Control Panel and customize your tablet. (On a Mac, choose System 
Preferences ➪ Wacom Tablet. In Windows, choose Start ➪ All Programs ➪ Wacom 
Tablet ➪ Wacom Tablet Properties.) The Control Panel (see Figure 19-2) enables 
you to assign a specific function or keystroke to each of the ExpressKeys, Touch 
Ring, and Touch Strips (not available on all models), as well as program your 
various pens and mouse. (Options vary for Bamboo and Cintiq models.) Settings 

CHAPTER 19  Ten Reasons to Love Your Wacom Tablet     385
can be customized for Photoshop, Bridge, and even iTunes. You can share saved 
Preferences settings with friends and co-workers.
The Accessories
Wacom offers a variety of pens, an airbrush, a five-button mouse, and even a 
CAD-friendly lens cursor to help you get the very most out of your tablet.  
Choose the input device that’s best for you — or switch among several, using the 
one that’s most appropriate for the specific job at hand. (Not all accessories work 
with the new Pro models.)
Cintiq for the Photoshop Pro
The ultimate tablets for most Photoshop users are, of course, the Cintiq tab-
lets, which integrate a monitor into the tablet, enabling you to paint or draw 
directly on your image. Wacom offers the Cintiq in the very portable 13-inch size 
($799.95 and $999.95), the 22-inch HD model ($1,699.95 and $1,999.95), and 
the huge 27-inch HD Touch model ($1,899.95 and $2,399.95). (The price differ-
ence depends on whether or not the screen is touch-sensitive, enabling you to use 
your fingers for basic tasks and Gestures.) The Cintiq Pro models, with greater 
levels of sensitivity and the advanced Wacom Pro Pen 2, are 13 inch ($999.95) 
and 16 inch ($1,499.95). And although the prices may seem like a lot of money

for a tablet, it’s not too extreme if you 
consider the money you may save by 
not purchasing a monitor. Whether 
you use the integrated stand and 
paint on your Cintiq on your desk (see 
Figure 19-3) or take advantage of the 
long cable and work with the dis-
play in your lap, you’re bound to find 
increased accuracy and productivity 
at your fingertips — literally!
Until you’re perfectly comfortable 
using a stylus and tablet, the Cintiq 
line might be a bit of a stretch. But 
after you’ve worked with the more 
affordable lines of tablets (Intuos and the entry-level Bamboo pen models, includ-
ing the Bamboo Slate, starting at $129.95), you may develop a craving for a Cintiq!

CHAPTER 20  Ten Things to Know about HDR     387
Ten Things to Know 
about HDR
T
he world of photography continues to evolve at an amazing pace! Not only 
has digital photography replaced film for just about all uses, the various 
Raw file formats are more and more common in both professional and 
high-end hobbyist photography, and even a number of smartphones. A typical 
camera phone now captures as many or more pixels than did an expensive pocket 
camera just a few years ago. Smartphones that offer an HDR option can help in 
some challenging lighting conditions, such as a photo of a dark room with the 
bright outdoors in the windows. But the smartphone’s HDR option doesn’t hold a 
candle to the high dynamic range images you can produce with a good camera and 
Photoshop’s Merge to HDR Pro.
I begin this chapter with an explanation of high dynamic range photography, give 
you some pointers for capturing the images that you’ll use in an HDR image, and 
then explain how you actually combine and use HDR photos.
Chapter 20

388     PART 5  The Part of Tens
Understanding HDR
HDR stands for high dynamic range. The dynamic range is the visual “distance” 
from black to white. By making that visual distance greater, you create a wider 
tonal range in the image. The world we see around us contains far more range 
than can be reproduced on a monitor, printed to paper, or even saved in a 16-bit 
image. (See Chapter 6 for an explanation of 8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit color.)
Consider, for example, shooting an image in a room with windows on a sunny 
day. If you expose your image for the content of the room, whatever is outside is 
blown out and completely white. (See the examples in Figure 20-1.) If you expose 
for the outside, the content of the room is in shadow. So, why not create an image 
in which the content of the room and the world outside the windows are both 
properly exposed?
It may be that HDR is the future of photography, the way digital has supplanted 
film. But probably not, until we have cameras that can capture true HDR images 
natively (as some smartphones can), as well as a way to better take advantage 
of the enhanced tonal range when printing. Is HDR something about which you 
should be aware, so that you can take advantage of its potential to meet difficult 
challenges in your own photography? Absolutely!
Remember, too, that you can open a series of Raw images shot for merging to HDR 
and open them together into Camera Raw. Use the menu to the right of Filmstrip 
(near the upper left) to Select All and then Merge to HDR. You see a preview and 
the Align Images and Auto Tone boxes are selected. Try all four of the Deghost 
options to determine which works best with your images, and then click the 
Merge button. (If the images were shot properly, you likely don’t need the Show 
Overlay option.) Camera Raw generates a .dng file that you can further refine in 
Camera Raw if desired.

Capturing for Merge to HDR Pro
To merge several exposures into an HDR image, you need to have several expo-
sures with which to work. There are two ways to meet the challenge: You can 
shoot a series of exposures, or shoot one Raw image and make several copies with 
different exposure values.
If you want the absolutely best results from Merge to HDR Pro, keep two words 
in mind: manual and tripod. Those are the keys to capturing multiple exposures 
for use with Merge to HDR Pro. The only variable you want to change from shot 
to shot is the camera’s shutter speed — everything else, including focus, should 
remain the same. Your tripod should be sturdy and level, and a cable release is 
a good idea. You can use auto focus and auto exposure to set the lens and get an 
exposure recommendation from the camera. But then switch the lens to manual 
focus and set the camera to manual exposure. Before each exposure, adjust only 
the shutter speed.
How many exposures do you need? I recommend a minimum of three (the best 
exposure possible for the scene’s midtones, one “overexposed” for detail in the 
shadows, and one “underexposed” for detail in the highlights). Each scene differs 
to some degree, but you’ll want to capture as much of the tonal range as pos-
sible. It is better, however, to use seven separate exposures with Merge to HDR 
Pro. More than that is rarely necessary, and most scenes can be captured in five 
exposures.
If you are familiar with exposure values, try for a range of perhaps seven, including 
three below and three above the “optimal” exposure. If that’s unfamiliar terri-
tory, try shooting the optimal exposure, then taking a shot at ¼ the shutter speed 
of the first shot, and then taking a shot at four times the original shutter speed.
Okay, so say that you don’t have a tripod and there’s a shot that’s just crying for 
HDR. Set your camera to auto-bracket at the largest increment possible, set the 
camera to “burst” mode, get as settled as possible, frame the shot, focus, take 
a deep breath, let the breath out halfway, pause, then gently press and hold the 
shutter button. In burst mode, three (or more, depending on your camera) shots 
are taken as quickly as the camera can operate. In auto-bracket mode, the expo-
sure is automatically changed for each shot. (Note that you need to set the camera 
to auto exposure bracketing, sometimes seen as AEB, not white-balance bracket-
ing. Check your camera’s User Guide.)

390     PART 5  The Part of Tens
Preparing Raw “Exposures” in Camera Raw
Alternatively, and usually with quite good results, you can change the exposure 
after the fact using Camera Raw. (You’ll want to use a Raw image, not a JPEG 
image, for this technique.) Here’s how:
1.	Shoot the best exposure possible.
2.	Transfer the image to your computer.
3.	Open the image into Camera Raw.
Make sure that Camera Raw’s Workflow Options — click the line of info below 
the preview (between Save Image and Open Image) — are set to 16-bit color.
4.	Adjust the image until it looks perfect.
5.	Click the Open Image button to open from Camera Raw into Photoshop.
6.	Copy the image into a new file and save in the TIFF format.
Choose Select ➪ All, then choose Edit ➪ Copy, followed by File ➪ Close (don’t 
save), and then File ➪ New. (The preset will be set to Clipboard, so just click OK.) 
Choose Edit ➪ Paste followed by File ➪ Save As, choose TIFF as the file format, 
and save. Using this procedure strips out the EXIF data, making sure that 
Merge to HDR Pro doesn’t use the wrong exposure value.
7.	Reopen the original Raw file into Camera Raw.
8.	Drag the Exposure slider to the left to reduce the exposure by 2.
Two is just a general guideline — watch for maximum detail in the highlights.
9.	Hold down the Option/Alt key and click Open Image (Open Copy).
Opening as a copy prevents Camera Raw from overwriting the earlier adjust-
ment in the file’s metadata.
10.	Copy the image into a new file and save in the TIFF format.
Repeat Step 6, using a sequence number or other change to the filename to 
differentiate from the first TIFF.
11.	Reopen the Raw file into Camera Raw a third time.
12.	Drag the Exposure slider to the right to increase the exposure by 2.
Again, two is just a starting point — you want to see maximum detail in the 
shadows.
13.	Hold down the Option/Alt key and click Open Image (Open Copy).
14.	Copy the image into a new file and save in the TIFF format.
Repeat Step 6, using a third filename.

CHAPTER 20  Ten Things to Know about HDR     391
You can now use these three adjusted images in Merge to HDR, as described in the 
following section. The results likely won’t be as great as using a series of separate 
exposures, but should be better than a single exposure.
Working with Merge to HDR Pro
After you have the exposures from which you want to create your HDR master-
piece, you need to put them together using Photoshop’s Merge to HDR Pro.
You can open Merge to HDR Pro either through Photoshop’s File ➪ Automate 
menu or you can select the images to use in Bridge and use Bridge’s menu com-
mand Tools ➪ Photoshop ➪ Merge to HDR Pro. (If you open through Photoshop, 
you’ll either need to open the images into Photoshop first, or navigate to and 
select the images to use. In Merge to HDR Pro, click the Add Open Files button. If 
you use Bridge, the files must all be in the same folder on your hard drive.)
Be patient with Merge to HDR Pro — it has a lot of work to do before you get to 
play with the combined exposures. When the calculations are done, the Merge to 
HDR Pro window opens (as shown in Figure 20-2).
FIGURE 20-2: 
Merge to HDR 
opens after 
the images 
have been 
processed.

392     PART 5  The Part of Tens
Each of the images in the merge is shown as a thumbnail below the preview. You 
can deselect each image to see what impact it has on the combined exposure. 
(After you click the green checkmark, give Merge to HDR Pro a couple of moments 
to redraw the preview.) If you’re working with seven exposures and one seems to 
degrade from the overall appearance, leave that thumbnail’s box deselected.
By default, Merge to HDR Pro assumes that you want control over the image right 
away and sets the Mode menu to 16-bit color and Local Adaptation. You then have 
the options shown in Figure 20-2, as well as a few others, including the Curve 
panel (as shown in Figure 20-3).
So, what are all those options you see in Figure 20-2 and Figure 20-3?
»
» Preset: If you have a series of similar images that require the same adjust-
ments, you can save and load presets.
»
» Remove Ghosts: When you’re capturing multiple exposures, especially 
outdoors, moving objects in your image may have left “ghosts” behind. This 
option helps minimize those moving objects.
»
» Edge Glow: Use the Radius and Strength sliders in combination to increase 
the perceived sharpness of the image.
FIGURE 20-3: 
In 16-bit mode 
with Local 
Adaption, you 
have quite a bit 
of control.

CHAPTER 20  Ten Things to Know about HDR     393
»
» Tone and Detail: Think of the Gamma slider as your contrast control. 
Dragging to the right flattens the contrast between highlights and shadows; 
dragging to the left increases the contrast. The Exposure slider controls the 
overall lightness (to the right) or darkness (to the left) of the image, just like 
the Exposure slider in Camera Raw. The Detail slider sharpens the smallest 
bits in the image.
»
» Advanced: Visible in Figure 20-2, the Advanced tab shares space with Curve in 
Local Adaptation. The Shadow and Highlight sliders here control the lower 
and upper parts of the image’s tonal range. For both sliders, dragging left 
darkens and dragging right lightens. The Vibrance slider controls the satura-
tion of the near-neutral colors and Saturation controls all of the colors in the 
image. (These sliders, too, are comparable to their counterparts in Camera 
Raw and are discussed in more detail in Chapter 7.)
»
» Curve: Click the curve to add an anchor point and drag up/down or enter 
numeric values to adjust the tonality of the image. The Corner option 
produces a sharp change in the angle of the curve, which is generally not 
desirable. The button to the right of Corner resets the curve.
Switching the Mode menu to 32-bit color restricts your adjustment options. If you 
uncheck the Complete Toning in Adobe Camera Raw box, you can drag the slider 
to adjust the image’s white point. Clicking OK opens the image into Photoshop for 
any additional adjustments.
Note that 16-bit and 8-bit offer the same options, but I don’t recommend con-
verting from 32-bit to 8-bit in Merge to HDR Pro. If you need an 8-bit version of 
the image, work in 16-bit, and then after perfecting the image in Photoshop and 
saving as a 16-bit PSD or TIFF file, use the Image ➪ Mode ➪ 8-Bits/Channel com-
mand to convert and use Save As (or the Export menu’s Save for Web command) 
to save the 8-bit copy.
Keep in mind that when the changes you make in Merge to HDR’s 16-bit mode 
are finalized, the unused parts of the 32-bit tonal range are discarded. Working 
in 16-bit mode in Merge to HDR Pro can be convenient, but you can also stay in 
32-bit mode, open into Photoshop with the OK button, save the 32-bit image, 
and then do all the adjusting available in Merge to HDR Pro — and much more — 
in Photoshop. Want to fine-tune or change the image sometime down the road? 
Sure, why not? Simply reopen the saved 32-bit image and readjust, paint, filter, 
whatever, and then save again. Need a 16-bit copy to share or print? Save first as 
32-bit, adjust, and then use Save As to create the 16-bit copy.

394     PART 5  The Part of Tens
Saving 32-Bit HDR Images
A 32-bit image can be saved in a number of file formats, including Photoshop’s 
PSD and Large Document Format (PSB), as well as TIFF and some specialized for-
mats. Unless you’re sending the image to another program (perhaps when work-
ing with computer animation) or a client who has requested a specific format, 
stick with PSD, PSB, or TIFF.
HDR Toning
Found in the Image ➪ Adjustments menu, HDR Toning (see Figure 20-4) is your 
32-bit image adjustment master tool. It offers the same Local Adaptation, Equal-
ize Histogram, Exposure and Gamma, and Highlight Compression options found 
in Merge to HDR Pro. (Each of the options is described in the “Working with 
Merge to HDR Pro” section, earlier in this chapter.) Although it’s also available for 
16-bit and 8-bit images, HDR Toning is designed to work with the 32-bit images 
you create with Merge to HDR Pro. You’ll also see HDR Toning when you convert 
to 16-bit or 8-bit color through the Image ➪ Mode menu.
FIGURE 20-4: 
HDR Toning 
offers the 
same options 
as Merge to 
HDR Pro’s 
16-bit mode, 
but in 32-bit 
color.

CHAPTER 20  Ten Things to Know about HDR     395
Painting and the Color  
Picker in 32-Bit
In Photoshop you can paint in 32-bit color — with some caveats. The Brush, Pen-
cil, and Mixer Brush tools (but not Color Replacement) are available. The Blur, 
Sharpen, Smudge, and Eraser tools are also available in 32-bit color, but not 
Dodge, Burn, Sponge, Background Eraser, or Magic Eraser. Type layers, shapes, 
and paths are also at your command. You can add color to a 32-bit image with 
the Gradient tool, but not the Paint Bucket. And although the History Brush is 
available, the Art History Brush is not. The Content-Aware Move, Patch, Heal-
ing Brush, Spot Healing Brush, and the Red Eye tool are disabled. 32-bit images 
can have multiple layers and layer styles, too. Be aware, too, that not all blending 
modes are available in 32-bit color. Normal, Darken, Multiply, Lighten, Differ-
ence, and about a dozen less commonly used blending modes are enabled for tools 
and layers.
Working with painting tools and 
gradients requires a way to define 
color in 32-bits. When you open the 
Color Picker while working with a 
32-bit image, you’ll see something 
different. In Figure  20-5, the 32-bit 
Color Picker shows some additional 
features. In addition to working with 
HSB and RGB fields, color is defined 
with the Intensity slider. Think of 
“intensity” as “exposure.” It permits 
color values that go beyond RGB’s 
255/255/255. Define the color and 
choose how light or dark the exposure 
is — it’s sort of a fourth dimension of 
color definition.
The bar at the top shows the last-
selected color below and the current 
selection above. You can click any of 
the six previews to the left or the six 
to the right to jump to that color. You control how different each of the 12 previews 
is from the current color with Preview Stop Size.
FIGURE 20-5: 
The incredible range of 32-bit color requires a 
new way to define “color.”

396     PART 5  The Part of Tens
Filters and Adjustments in 32-Bit
The list of filters available in 32-bit color is even shorter than the list for 16-bit 
color found back in Chapter 15. The Filter Gallery, Adaptive Wide Angle, Camera 
Raw, Lens Correction, Liquify, Vanishing Point, and many other filters won’t work 
in 32-bit color, but you do have the key Blur and Sharpen filters, as well as Add 
Noise, Clouds and Difference Clouds, Lens Flare, Emboss, High Pass, Maximum, 
Minimum, and Offset. Don’t forget that 32-bit images can be converted to Smart 
Objects to apply Smart Filters!
The only adjustment layers that can be added to 32-bit images are Levels, Expo-
sure, Hue/Saturation, Photo Filter, Channel Mixer, and Color Lookup, along with 
New Fill Layer’s Solid Color, Gradient, and Pattern. In the Adjustments menu, 
you’ll also find HDR Toning and Desaturate at your service.
Selections and Editing in 32-Bit
Not surprisingly, the Rectangular Marquee, Elliptical Marquee, Single Row, Single 
Column, Lasso, and Polygon Lasso tools are available when working in 32-bit 
color because they simply create selections around pixels. Also not surprising is 
the unavailability of the Magnetic Lasso tool because it works its magic based on 
identifying differences between neighboring colors. And, on the subject of magic, 
the Magic Wand is also out of commission when working in 32-bit color, but you 
can work with the Quick Selection tool in your HDR image.
And after you have made your initial selection, you’ll find that Select and Mask and 
Select ➪ Focus Area are fully functional in 32-bit color, as are the Select ➪ Modify 
commands and Transform Selection. You can also save and load selections (alpha 
channels) and work in Quick Mask mode in 32-bit images.
Printing HDR Images
Okay, well, you can’t really print the entire tonal range of a 32-bit image — no 
printer (or paper) can handle the range. In fact, you can’t print an image in 32-bit 
color at all from Photoshop (the Print and Print One Copy commands are dis-
abled). What you can do is print a 16-bit (or 8-bit) image that has outstanding 
highlights, outstanding shadows, and outstanding midtones.

CHAPTER 20  Ten Things to Know about HDR     397
After saving the 32-bit original, use Photoshop’s Image ➪ Mode ➪ 16-Bits/ 
Channel command to convert to 16-bit color (using Local Adaptation, as described 
earlier in this chapter). After changing the color depth, choose Image ➪ Image 
Size to set your desired print size. You can either deselect the Resample check box 
and enter your desired print dimensions, letting Photoshop calculate the new res-
olution, or you can use the Resample option and input both the print dimensions 
and resolution. The resampling algorithm should be set to Automatic or Preserve 
Details, not Nearest Neighbor or Bilinear, neither of which is appropriate for most 
photos. (Those are your only four options when resampling a 32-bit image.)
When the image is ready, open Photoshop’s File ➪ Print window. Choose the 
printer and click the Print Settings button to set up the printer. Choose the specific 
paper on which you will be printing and disable the printer’s color management. 
Choose the printer’s resolution and — if your printer has the capability — select 
16-Bit Output.
To the right in Photoshop’s Print dialog box (as shown way back in Figure 4-11),  
make sure that Photoshop is managing colors and that you have selected the 
printer’s own profile for the specific paper on which you are printing. Gener-
ally, you should use the Relative Colorimetric rendering intent and Black Point 
Compensation. (Note that if your print is way too dark, Black Point Compensation 
should be disabled.)
You need to make all of the printer-specific choices by clicking the Print Settings 
button before clicking the Print button. If you want to save this 16-bit version of 
the image, use Save As to create a new file. Using the Save command would over-
write the 32-bit original HDR image.
And there you have it  — ten things you should know about HDR.  You’re now 
ahead of the curve and ready for the Next Big Thing in digital photography!
On behalf of everyone involved with the production of this book, let me say thanks 
for coming along for the ride. We wish you peace, love, health, and happiness!


APPENDIX  Photoshop CC’s Blending Modes     399
Photoshop CC’s 
Blending Modes
Blending modes in Photoshop CC determine how the pixels on one layer interact 
with pixels on lower layers and how painting tools interact with pixels already 
present on the active layer and layers below.
»
» Normal: Normal is the default blending mode for new layers and the basic 
painting tools. Depending on opacity, the upper pixel completely blocks the 
lower pixel.
»
» Threshold: When working with images in Indexed Color or Bitmap color 
modes, Threshold is the “Normal” blending mode. Because Indexed Color 
uses a maximum of 256 distinct color and Bitmap uses only black and white, 
most blending modes are not available when working in those color modes.
»
» Dissolve: Only semi-transparent pixels produce changes in the image’s 
appearance. Those pixels are randomly scattered, producing rough edges on 
anti-aliased artwork.
»
» Darken: The Darken blending mode compares the individual color compo-
nent channels (RGB or CMYK) of the base and blend colors and retains the 
lower value (RGB) or higher value (CMYK). It works on each channel individu-
ally for each pixel.
»
» Multiply: The Multiply blending mode multiples the color values of each base 
and blend pixel (RGB or CMYK) and uses the resulting value, which is always 
darker unless blending with black.
»
» Color Burn: Color Burn simulates the darkroom technique used to darken 
areas of a photo by increasing exposure time for that area. Blending dark 
colors over a base color produces a darker resulting color. Color Burn 
generally increases contrast. White as a blend color produces no change.
»
» Linear Burn: Like Color Burn, Linear Burn generally darkens (except where 
the base color is white). Linear Burn decreases brightness rather than 
increasing contrast.
Appendix

400      Adobe Photoshop CC For Dummies
»
» Darker Color: While the Darken blending mode looks at the luminosity of 
each pixel channel-by-channel, Darker Color looks at the overall luminosity of 
the base and blend pixels and retains whichever is darker. It generally 
produces less of a color shift than does Darken.
»
» Lighten: The Lighten blending mode compares the individual color compo-
nent channels (RGB or CMYK) of the base and blend colors and retains the 
higher value (RGB) or lower value (CMYK). It works on each channel individu-
ally for each pixel.
»
» Screen: Screen is the mathematical opposite of the Multiply blending mode. 
The inverse of each pixels’ color value is multiplied. The resulting color is 
lighter than the base color.
»
» Color Dodge: The opposite of Color Burn, the Color Dodge simulates the 
darkroom technique of lightening areas of a photo by reducing the exposure 
time. It’s much like Photoshop’s Dodge tool, but generally results in both 
lighter and less saturated result colors.
»
» Linear Dodge (Add): The base color is lightened to reflect the blend color. 
Blending with black produces no change.
»
» Lighter Color: While the Lighten blending mode looks at the luminosity of 
each pixel channel-by-channel, Lighter Color looks at the overall luminosity of 
the base and blend pixels and retains whichever is lighter. It generally 
produces less of a color shift than does Lighten.
»
» Overlay: Consider Overlay to be a mix of the Multiply and Screen blending 
modes. If the blend colors are light, it works like Screen and if the blend pixels 
are dark, it works like Multiply. Overlay often produces a shift in hue as well as 
brightness.
»
» Soft Light: Soft Light combines the effects of Color Dodge and Color Burn. If 
the blend color is light, the result is lighter; if the blend color is dark, the result 
is darkened. Soft Light is often a more subtle option to Overlay.
»
» Hard Light: Hard Light is a more vivid version of Soft Light. Darker areas on 
the blend layer produce darker result colors; lighter areas on the blend layer 
produce lighter result colors. Painting with dark and light shades of gray on a 
layer set to Hard Light can be an effective way to increase contrast in specific 
areas of an image.
»
» Vivid Light: Vivid Light is much like Overlay in that it both darkens and 
lightens, but it also generally increases saturation significantly.
»
» Linear Light: The Linear Light blending mode works much like Vivid Light and 
can be considered a mix of Linear Dodge and Linear Burn. Lighter blend pixels 
produce lighter result colors; darker blend pixels produce darker results. 

APPENDIX  Photoshop CC’s Blending Modes     401
Linear Light works with brightness values, which can better protect hue in the 
resulting colors than can Vivid Light.
»
» Pin Light: Pin Light combines the Darken and Lighten blending modes. Where 
blend colors are darker than the base color, they are retained, but if the base 
color is darker, it’s retained. When working with light blend pixels, the lighter 
of the blend and base colors is retained.
»
» Hard Mix: The Hard Mix blending mode produces a posterizing effect by 
forcing similar colors to a single value. When working with RGB images, the 
channel values for blend and base colors are added. Any value over 255 is set 
to 255, if less than 255, the value is set to 0.
»
» Each channel value is calculated individually for each pixel. The result is an 
image that consists entirely of black, white, red, green, blue, cyan, magenta, 
and yellow pixels.
»
» Difference: The Difference blending mode compares the brightness of the 
blend and base colors and the lower value is subtracted from the other. Black 
produces no change, while white will invert the pixel’s color.
»
» Exclusion: Exclusion is a less dramatic version of Difference.
»
» Subtract: Subtract compares the base and blend values in each channel for 
each pixel and subtracts the blend value from the base value, generally 
resulting in a darker image with substantial color shifts.
»
» Divide: The blend color is divided by the base color, channel by channel, for 
each pixel. It generally produces a much lighter result color.
»
» Hue: This blending mode retains the luminosity (brightness) and saturation 
values of the base color and substitutes the hue value of the blend color.
»
» Saturation: The base color’s luminosity and hue are retained and the blend 
color’s saturation value is used.
»
» Color: The base color’s luminosity is retained, and both the hue and satura-
tion of the blend color are applied.
»
» Luminosity: The base color’s hue and saturation are retained, and the blend 
color’s luminosity is used.
»
» Behind: Used by painting tools, this blending mode applies the foreground 
color to pixels on the active layer according to the pixels’ transparency. 
Completely opaque pixels are not changed. (With gray, this blending mode 
can be used to paint shadows “behind” artwork on the layer.)
»
» Clear: Used with painting tools and shape tools set to add pixels to a layer, 
this blending mode works much like the Eraser tool, reducing the opacity of 
pixels on a layer.

402      Adobe Photoshop CC For Dummies
»
» Replace: (Spot Healing Brush and Healing Brush only) This blending mode is 
used to help preserve texture along the edges of the brush strokes.
»
» Pass Through: (Layer groups only) Any adjustment layer within the group is 
applied to all layers below it within the group and below the group. (To restrict 
an adjustment layer to only the layers below it within the group, change the 
group’s blending mode from Pass Through to Normal.)
»
» Add and Subtract for Calculations and Apply Image: The RGB value of each 
channel is added or subtracted and the Scale factor (1.0 to 2.0) is used as a 
divisor. (A Scale value of 2 averages the channel values.) An offset factor can 
be added as a constant applied to or subtracted from each calculation.

art photographer, and the Help Desk director for KelbyOne (formerly the National 
Association of Photoshop Professionals). He has authored more than a dozen books 
on Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, computer graphics, and ­photography. Pete

World Instructor Dream Team, hosting the KelbyOne Expert Bar. As the KelbyOne 
Help Desk director, Pete personally answers thousands of e-mails annually about 
Photoshop and computer graphics. He has contributed to and assisted on such 
projects as special effects for feature films and television, major book and maga-
zine publications, award-winning websites, and fine-art exhibitions. He serves 
as a computer graphics efficiency consultant for a select corporate clientele, and 
shoots exclusive photographic portraiture. Pete’s prior careers have included bar-
tending, theater, broadcast journalism, professional rodeo, business management, 
and military intelligence interrogation. Pete and his wife, Professor Mary Ellen 
O’Connell, of the University of Notre Dame Law School, live in South Bend, Indiana.


Author’s Dedication
I have written (and John Wiley & Sons has published) this book for you — the 
many who learn and live by the written word. Whether on paper or tablet, these 
words and illustrative figures were put here for you. There is no irony in the fact 
that you’ll use these words to produce pictures.
Author’s Acknowledgments
First, I’d like to thank Steve Hayes and the rest of the superb crew at John Wiley &  
Sons that put the book together. I’d also like to acknowledge Scott and Kalebra 
Kelby, Jean Kendra, and Dave Moser of KelbyOne. With their support, I’m the Help 
Desk director for KelbyOne, and get to share my Photoshop knowledge with tens of 
thousands of members — and with you. I also thank my Help Desk colleagues Janine 
Smith and Rob Sylvan for their support during the development of this project.
Another great group from whom I continue to receive support are my colleagues 
on the Photoshop World Instructor Dream Team. If you haven’t been to Photo-
shop World, try to make it — soon. Rather than “Photoshop conference,” think 
“Photoshop festival.” Where else can you see suits and slackers, side by side, 
savoring every single syllable? It’s more than just training and learning: It’s a 
truly intellectually invigorating environment. And, of course, I thank my wife, the 
wonderful Professor Mary Ellen O’Connell of the Notre Dame Law School, for her 
unwavering support during yet another book project.
