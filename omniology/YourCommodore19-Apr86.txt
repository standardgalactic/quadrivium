GAMES SOFTWARE HAS ALWAYS MAN-
aged t o  cover t he most weird and
wonderful themes and the latest new
releases are no exception.
There are two new ﬁlm spin-offs just
released on to the market and the ﬁrst,
from Electric Dreams Software, is based
on Steven Spielberg's recently highly
successful fantasy movie -  Back to the
Future. Rod Cousens, Electric Dreams'
MD, makes great claims for the new
game. "It is a strong game in its own right,
designed to complement the ﬁlm -  we
haven't just taken the name of the ﬁlm."
Perhaps the most innovative aspect of the
new game is that it  features teenage
romance and even an on-screen kiss!
Back to the Future closely follows the
storyline of the movie in which the hero,
Marty, arrives in the 1950s and ﬁnds
himself having to engineer a romantic
meeting between his parents, Lorraine
and George. Certainly not your average
zap-em-up! To enter this coffee bar world
of teenage dreams will cost you a mere
9.95 and you only need one qualiﬁcation
- a C64.
Still on the subject of ﬁlms, it's classic
horror this time. Remember The Phantom
of the Opera, that ghastly hunchback
who roamed the Paris sewers at the turn of
the century? He's now been resurrected
for the fourth time only the screen's a bit
smaller this time round. There have been
three ﬁlm versions of this chilling tale, in
1931, 1943 and 1962. 1986 sees The
Phantom's big revival with not only a
computer game, but also an Andrew
Lloyd Webber stage musical.
This one's also a love story but in an
entirely different vein. A  horribly dis-
ﬁgured musician falls for a beautiful opera
singer. N o t  exactly a n  ideal match
because she's n o t  i n  t h e  least b i t
interested. Not deterred by her revulsion
the Phantom takes the bull by the horns
and abducts her. From there it's a classic
damsel i n  distress style rescue plot.
Popular opera themes bring a touch of
class and author John Ransley calls it
"Hunchback in evening dress". If you've
got a C64 you can ﬁnd out for yourself.
M e lb o u r n e  H o u s e  r e c e n t l y
announced the release of the epic sequel
STATEMENTS

to The Hobbit. This of course is the Lord of
The Rings Part I. Because of the enormous
size of the program, the game has had to
be released on two cassettes and the
package also includes a copy of the paper-
back, The Fellowship to the Ring., plus an
extensive instruction booklet.
Melbourne House claims many out-
standing features for the game including
its ability to understand Inglish -  let's
hope its spelling isn't always that bad!
With Inglish, apparently, you can now say
almost anything you want because the
computer c an recognise intelligent
sentences u p  t o 128 characters long,
pretty impressive. There is a large degree
of interaction with the other characters,
you can answer and tell them what to do.
There are over 200 locations, a vocabulary
of 800 words and even a multi-player
option. It's available on the C64 on both
cassette and disk, t15.95 and £19.95
respectively. I f  you're really into the
Tolkien c ult then you might also be
interested i n  the Lord o f  the Rings
hologram offer. Each hologram features
the image of a Nazgul, or ring wraith -
TA
commonly known as a Black Rider. A
small hologram -  5" x 4" -  costs E29.95
including p&p and there is a limited
edition of a large version - 100 copies only
- for a staggering £149.95.
English Software has just released two
new titles which are as far apart in concept
as is possible. Knight Games is a medieval
tournament ty pe game wher e y o u
compete in seven ancient and very violent
events: Sword ﬁghting, duelling axemen,
archery, quaterstaff bashing, crossbow
shooting, ball and chain ﬂailing and
pikestaff contests. Deﬁnitely  Daley
Thompson with a difference.
The other English Software release is
Elektraglide, a  fantasy racing game
featuring tunnels, hair-raising bends,
scrolling graphics and a  rock music
soundtrack. These excursions into the
future and the past are for the C64 and
both will cost you E8.95 on cassette.
Elektraglide is also available on disk at
[12.95.
Mastertronic has launched itself into
the new year with a ﬂourish. After a very
successful 1985, there are several new

-

releases on the way which Mastertronic
hopes will continue its success in the
budget software market.
There are three new Mastertronic
games for Commodore machines -  two
are for the C64 and one for the C-16. Kane
is another wild west adventure, which
seems all of a sudden to have become a
popular games genre. Mastertronic says:
"It makes High Noon look  like a 12
o'clock lunch break."
Mastertronic is  also going for this
year's oddest game title award with
another C64 release, dozily entitled Zzzzl
Hopefully it's not a game guaranteed to
send you to sleep.
The C-16 game is called Big Mac and
that's all we can tell you at the moment
because Mastertronic has labelled it top
secret. Should be a meaty one though, so
look forward to it with relish! All three are
in the £1.99 range but they're not all
edible.
Hewson Consultants have ofﬁcially
changed their name to plain old Hewson
and are sporting a new image for the new
year. Spearheading Hewson's n e w
releases for 1986 is Uridium, the sequel to
Paradroid, which is reviewed in this issue
of Your Commodore. Turn to our Action
Replay section t o  ﬁnd out what we
thought of it.
There's also a very high-tech setting
for Beyond's latest title Quake Minus
One. A terrorist group called the Robot
Liberation Front are trying to sabotage the
Titan Power Station which is situated in
the depths of the Atlantic Ocean and
supplies all the world's industrial nations
with energy. There are ﬁve computers
down there and four of them are in the
hands of the RLF. That's what comes of
putting all your eggs in one basket. You've
got to regain control of the electronic
installation from the hands of the metallic
malefactors. It's on the Monolith label at
£9.95 and is also featured in this month's
Action Replay.
Also from Beyond, this time by Denton
Design, is Enigma Force, the C64 sequel to
Shadowﬁre. Five members of the Enigma
team -  all with totally unpronounceable
names -  are escorting the evil General
Zoff to face the consequences of his life
of crime. When war break's out, the
spaceship crashes and the Enigma Force
are faced with the daunting task of killing
Zoff, ﬁnding the only spaceworthy ship
on the planet and escaping. Will it be too
much for even their awesome powers?
Spend £9.95 and ﬁnd out.
Activision has now released Mind-
shadow o n  t he C64. It's  a  graphic
adventure which will be a nightmare for
amnesiacs. You awake on a deserted
beach with no memory and an uncertain
future. If you decide not to take a quick
holiday by the sea, then you should go in
search of your identity. There are logic
puzzles for experienced adventurers. SO
screens with detailed graphics and some
with animation, an on-screen adventure
tutorial for beginners and a cheat book if
you get stuck on the hard bits.
Koronis Rift is another in Activision's
series of Lucas Film games. It's about a
wandering technoscavenger w h o
discovers the legendary Koronis Rift -  a
weapons testing ground of the ancients,
presumably a latterday Bikini Atoll. It's
littered with valuable junk which is yours
for the taking, provided that you don't get
wasted by the ancient guardians - E9.99 on
C64 cassette.
Now a couple of quickies from CRL -
there are two new C64 games out, Space
Doubt and Causes of Chaos, both are on
sale now at f  8.95. There's also been an
ofﬁcial leak from CRL to say that a Nu-
Wave label is to be established which will
feature alternative software. The release is
in March and will be entitled Darkness at
Dawn. What's new about it? It's all sound
and no graphics. Most odd -  deﬁnitely
different.
And for Max Headroom fans -  the
game based on the ﬁlm of the birth of the
ﬁrst computer generated TV presenter
will soon be appearing on your computer
screen. The game is from Quicksi Iva and
plots the creation and subsequent career
of sarcastic Max. It'll be out on the C64.

Generally Speaking
HACKERS BEWARE, THERE IS NOW A
new Terminal Security Device aimed at
protecting dial-up minicomputer data-
bases from unauthorised visitors.
The device, manufactured by Black
Box, incorporates a hidden maze pass-
word protection scheme that will store up
to 25 different passwords. Three attempts
can be made to enter a correct password
before the unit blocks all further tries for
15 minutes.
There is no prompt for a password but
the computer is alerted if unauthorised
entry is attempted.
Three Commodore shows are to be
hosted this year by Database Publications.
The ﬁrst of these is the ofﬁcial Commo-
dore Show at the Novotel, London on
May 31 to June 1. Commodore's Chris
Kaday said: "We are looking forward to a
long a n d  fr uitful association w it h
Database. These are important times for
us at Commodore with the launch of our
new Amiga as well as maintaining the
increasing interest in the 64 and 128.
The Two Commodore Horizons Shows
will be held at UMIST in September and
the Novotel in November.
The computer games industry has
launched an appeal to aid the current
government anti-drugs campaign. The
appeal was launched at the InDin, the
annual dinner for the computer games
industry.
A spontaneous auction for  cham-
pagne raised E14,000 to start the appeal.
Companies who made the joint bid were

It is hoped that most funds will be
raised from sales of a gmes compilation
tape. The idea was conceived by Rod
Cousens, a leading light behind the Soft

The compilation tape will be called Off

spring at a cost of E6.99. Companies who
have already agreed to donate games are

Computer Weekends
Buying a computer is like buying a car,
once you've bought it you have to spend
quite a lot of time learning how to use it.
Where cars are concerned there are
plenty of schools which are willing to
teach you enough to pass your driving test
but with a computer you're on your own.
Ardmore Adventure has decided to do
something about this  b y  prov iding
weekend courses at Crest Hotels up and
down the country.
In recent months, Ardmore has run
courses, organised by Commodore (UK),
which have proved s o successful that
Ardmore has now decided to continue
the courses for anyone who wants to learn
more a b o u t  t h e i r  C o m m o d o r e
computers. Families get extra beneﬁts
from these weekends because three
children are given free accommodation
when accompanied by two adults, under
Crest's Welcome Break scheme.
The price of the course is only £30 per
person with a charge of (27.50 per night
for dinner bed and breakfast per adult.

In Memorium of Home
Computing
The more I read in the computer press,
the more I realise that home computing is
slowly, but surely, dying. You'll probably
think I'm talking rubbish, but let us con-
sider the main causes of this situation.
First we have the computer manufac-
turers. D u e  t o  mar k et pressures,
manufacturers have shifted emphasis, ﬁrst
to games and more recently to more
serious applications. Only a few years ago,
there were a range of machines which
were extremely well suited t o  home
computing in  its  fullest sense. Such
machines as the Nascom, Tangerine and
Acorn Atom provided limited facilities in
their basic form but offered immense
potential f o r  expansion. Despite the
efforts o f  manufacturers, I  refuse t o
accept that t h e  n e w  generation o f
machines will be of value to the home
user. The average home user does not use
a computer for accounts, data bases or
word processing and the power of the 16
bit machines would be underused. I don't
see the Amiga or ST being in the budget of
the home user and, as older eight bit
machines vanish, what will be left behind?
Next, we have the software houses. I
the days of the Vic, ZX-81 and the early
days of the 64 and Spectrum, we had a
marvellous explosion i n  the software
market w it h  volumes o f  games etc.
appearing. We did have indications of
doom in the behaviour of such companies
as Imagine but on the whole, it was a time
of small adventurous companies. Unfor-
tunately, money killed this scene and the
big boys prevailed at the expense of the
small trail blazers. Now we have expen-
sive games written by armies of prog-
rammers, graphic artists etc. which, in
truth, aren't always better than the earlier
material. The only rays of sunshine in this
The page where you tell us
what you think about life, the]
[universe but especially the
computers.
world of Commodore
area are the budget software houses
which have shown us what can be done
for only a couple of pounds per game.
Finally, we have the magazines. Due to
the need for advertising revenue, maga-
zines have been forced to follow the
market trends with a resulting increase in
emphasis on software reviews etc. The
content o f  Practical Computing, f o r
example, has  n o  relevance t o  t h e
magazines title or  the material which
appeared in its early days. Overall, there
are very few magazines which cater for
the home programmer. (Commodore
User is probably the best example of a
"user" magazine going down the drain).
Overall, the only option available to
the home user, is the local user group.
Only through such groups, or the parent
group ICPUG, is there a ﬂow of informa-
tion, ideas o r  help t o  the computer
enthusiast.
In conclusion, I  fear  that what
promised t o  b e  t h e  mos t exciting
development of the last few decades may
well simply prove t o  be a  ﬁve year
wonder. What do you think?

Not so Easy Entry
I am having trouble with the Easy Entry
program which appeared in the January
issue of Your Commodore. The variables
"check" and "WY" never seem to agree
with each other and consequently, I am
not getting past the Error stage.
I by passed this stage and went on to
the save portion of the program. But on
entering "Mon-one" as a ﬁlename, 33280
as a start address and 33496 as the end
address, I get an "Illegal quantity in line
440" message.
As "Sid" is poked in lines 540 and 550,
presumably i t  should"burp" when an
error is registered.
Also, no mention was made in the text
that single and double digit numbers
should b e  "padded" with preceding
zeros on entry.
The overall principle of the program is
quite good and it would be a godsend if I
could get it working. However, it needs a
few modiﬁcations t o  be u p t o  Your
Commodore standards.
I do hope that it is only a minor hiccup
in the printing that line 400 is the ﬁrst on
the program and the start line 100 is
somewhere near the middle!
like Eric Pickering of Corwen, I too
was a Y64 subscriber and became dissatis-

the editor were t o  n o  avail. I  have
therefore decided that the best remedy
for any magazine which falls short of
expectations is simply not to buy it!

A few people do seem to be having
problems with the Easy Entry program
therefore it is worth going through the
main problems here.
1) I'm afraid that two halves of the listing
were printed the wrong way round the
ﬁrst time Easy Entry was printed. This does
not affect the program in any way if you
use the same line numbers, the computer
will sort them into the correct order.
2) When you type in a line you must enter
all digits.
3) A number of people are getting a syntax
error in line 400 this is because they are
typing the keyword TO instead of the
Basic variable TO (T,ZER0). Keywords
cannot be used as Basic variables hence
the error.
4) We have had a few problems with
garbage collection. When you enter a
string on the C64 it is stored in memory.
When you enter a new string with the
same name the old string is not always
erased. Thus the old strings build up in
memory and it is possible that the strings
may overwrite the program. Adding the
following line to the Easy Entry program
will prevent this ever happening.
225 G=FRE (0)
5) Some people are having problems with
the save routine. Once you save or load a
section of code to or from tape or disk the
program w ill return t o  t h e  'START
ADDRESS' prompt. This is asking for the
address at which you wish to continue
typing. lithe program does return to this
prompt then i t  w ill have SAVEd or
LOADed correctly, Don't forger that
when y ou SAVE you must SAVE the
program from the very beginning. You
will not be able to list any of the data that
you have saved, if you load it in and type
LIST then you will only get a lot of rubbish
printed to the screen. This is because you
can't list machine code.
There are n o  other errors in  the
program apart from the one mentioned in
4) above. if you do get any other problems
then I would advise that you check your
typing very carefully.

'Eric Doyle  has been
[examining Gremlin Graphics'
range of C-16 games.
OUR BELOVED EDITOR MAY HAVE
gnomes at the bottom of his garden, but
for the past month I've had gremlins in my
C-16. Not the sort that gum up the works,
but the current output of C-16 games
from Gremlin Graphics.
The ﬁrst is a not-to-be-missed bargain
package containing four of  Gremlin's
earlier C-16 games for a mere 19.95. The
games are: Dork's Dilemma, Xargon
Wars, Petals of Doom, and Tycoon Tex,
Dork's Dilemma is to collect the parts
of his spacecraft and reassemble them
correctly. The pieces are spread through-
out rooms which form a ﬁve by ﬁve grid.
Each room has one or more exits and in
the centre of the grid is a force ﬁeld which
holds a portion of the craft. Roaming
around the passageways in each room are
four nasty little Zobwats who will track
you down and home in for the kill.
Dork looks a bit like one of those kids'
toys that will wobble but won't fall over.
His head and neck are duck-like but when
he moves he pulls in his head and rolls
everywhere. His armoury consists of an
unlimited supply of time bombs with
short fuses so when he sets one off he has
to r oll lik e mad t o  escape before it
explodes.
The unf r iendly  aliens  c an b e
eliminated by using the bombs sensibly,
always bearing in mind that the blast does
not penetrate the walls of the passages.
After a number of these Zabwats have
been blasted the piece is released from the
force ﬁeld and displayed on a grid at the
right hand side of the screen.
When Dork has collected enough
pieces, the game can be paused while you
sort them into the correct order. The
game ends when the craft is completed.
Dork's Dilemma is a difﬁcult game to
play and some of the screens require very
precise timing if he is to succeed in his
mission.
Though Tycoon Tex is one of the
visually mor e sophisticated games, I
found it to be fairly tedious to play. Tex is a
JR-type oil baron protect:ng his pipeline
from attack by using his trusty six-shooter.
As in all the best Western-style stories the
'six-gun' has an unlimited supply o f
bullets.
Firing as he goes Tex has to run the
length of the pipeline jumping over the
many breaks and avoiding the variety of
missiles which assail him. At ﬁrst the only
problem is  an aeroplane which drops
bombs on to the pipe (or Tex if he gets in
the way). Later screens bring the extra
problems o f  bouncing bombs, crash
explosives and there must be Indians in
them thar hills because arrows keep ﬂying
across the screen.
Gremlin Gra klic5
The animation of Tex is very good
indeed as he runs, jumps and crouches
but I found that the length of the pipeline
caused me a little eyestrain after a while
which led to carelessness, then frustration
and eventually tedium. These feelings will
certainly not be shared by everyone who
tries this game, but I gave up and I don't
care if I never see this one again.
12
Xargon Wars is a game akin to Phoenix,
the old arcade favourite, and despite the
changes in arcade games over the years,
this kind of shoot-em-up is still one of my
favourite pastimes. You control the attack
ship at the bottom of the screen and blast
the hordes of aliens who appear above
you, dropping bombs like raindrops from
a stormy sky.

R e v ie ws
The aliens appear in a multitude of
guises and formations, some in dense
groups, others i n  long never-ending
streams and s till mo r e  i n  swirling
snowstorms. Dodging whilst ﬁring is the
order of the day and the rather sensitive
movement controls only  add t o  the
problem. With 16 screens to pass through,
the Xargons kept me busy for many a
happy hour and I still only reached screen
ﬁve!
Gardening in outer space makes Percy
Thrower's constant battle against greenﬂy
and mildew looks like picnic. In Petals of
Doom our green-ﬁngered spaceman has
to laser blast a host of alien blights if he is
to grow a harvestable crop.
Unlike Percy, our hi-tech horticult-
urist has a radar screen to warn him of
impending attack as  h e  patrols his
allotment in the sky. On this screen he can
see from the mode of approach which
aliens are attacking and work out from
experience the best way to deal with
them.
In the low gravity of his garden, our
astronaut can use his jetpack to reach the
high-ﬂying threats but beware because
his power pack can overheat if too much
use is made of the gun or the jets. If this
happens, and it will, his only recourse is to
hide while his pack cools down and then
try to undo the harm that will have been
done to his crops.
If all of the plants successfully reach
maturity, ther e i s  always another
allotment waiting just around the next
screen a n d  b e  careful because t he
attackers are even more numerous and
ferocious.
Petals of Doom is a game with limited
appeal. After a while its repetitive nature
tends to give way to boredom despite all
of the frenzied activity.
Overall, this twin cassette pack offers a
good variety of games for your money and
I cannot honestly say that I  would
condemn any of them to being a waste of
time or energy. The complaints that I have
merely display my own tastes in computer
games and another reviewer might see
them in a totally different light.
In the Gremlin library there are four
more games whic h ar e individually
packaged at £6.95.

where Xargon Wars left off and for my
money it shouldn't have bothered. If your
idea of fun is to have wave after wave of
attacking ships approaching your battle
cruiser from screen right as you duck and
weave at the right hand side, then this
could be for you.
This game truly lacks variety of any
kind except in the range of alien shapes
attacking you. Control is limited to up and
down movements as you ﬁre contin-
uously at the onrushing foe. In many
similar games you can at least increase and
decrease y our  speed t o  dodge t he
oncoming hordes and without this facility
the game becomes a  d u l l  passive
experience.
The o n ly  br eak  t o  t his  rather
uninspiring battle is  t h e  occasional
appearance of a fuel pod which reﬁlls
your dwindling supplies but I defy anyone
to stay awake long enough.
Another irksome feature of this game
became obvious when I tried to play it
using the keyboard option. To Gremlin's
credit, all of their games have the option
to use either a joystick or the keyboard
keys but they fail to give the option to
redeﬁne the keys for the beneﬁt of left-
handed players. This is not my complaint
in this  case. T h e  keyboard option
invariably throws you into pause mode at
the height of the action. An on-screen
message implores y ou t o  press G  t o
continue but on doing this the game
aborts back t o  the beginning. I  got
nowhere in this mode and I feel that such
an obvious failing ought to have been
obvious during the play testing stage of
the games development.
Gullwing Falcon is a different kettle of
ﬁsh altogether. A Huck Roger's look-alike,
it features pseudo 3D as the Falcon ﬂies
into the screen across a landscape called
the Desert o f  Pillars. The pillars are
immense gateways o f  stone through
which the Falcon must steer to gain
maximum points.
This game boasts 99 levels which
means 99 waves of enemy ships which
must be eliminated. Thankfully, Gremlin
don't seem to go for ream after ream of
imaginative, scene-setting drivel, jus t
enough is given to set the scene and
nothing more. However, sometimes the
text can be a little devious. In this case you
are advised to attempt to steer through
the pillars because 'the pirates' ships dare
not travel between the giant stone posts.
What they don't tell you is that the pirates
are not averse to hovering behind the
posts waiting t o  pounce when y ou
emerge! Take my warning, always blast
like crazy as you pass between the posts.
Your forward speed can be controlled
from interestingly fast Warp one t o
absolutely s uic idal speeds. Q u ic k
reactions are needed to dispense with the
aliens who may use ﬂying saucers of
various shapes or land hopping craft.
With so many screens on offer I defy
anyone to complete this game.

- e v i e w s
Ah so! We come to the penultimate
game o n my  list. Set in the land of
Emperor To-Ming's Kung-Fu guards, you
play the role of the banished Kung-Fu Kid.
Whatever you did to deserve such a fate is
not mentioned but you are now a lowly
level eight ﬁghter and you must progress
to the highest level t o  regain y our
Emperor's trust.
This means that you must enter into
battle against the Emperor's minions with
each screen culminating in a battle against
one of the Guardian lizards. Your kung-fu
skills are limited to forward punches and
14
kicks whic h mus t b e  used against
attackers who come from behind as well
as in front. Colossal leaping skills are also
yours but in battle try to conserve your
energy for the ﬁnal ﬁght with the lizard.
Sharigan stars zip across the screen
and you must punch these away from the
second screen onwards, with swords,
daggers and magical pots adding to the
excitement of higher levels.
The graphics ar e adequate and
realistically animated and the timing for
your blows must be carefully practised if
you don't want the stufﬁng knocked out
of you before the end of the ﬁrst screen.
Altogether Kung-Fu Kid is an enjoyable
little romp but limited in its staying power
fear.
Keeping the best to last we reach
Sword of Destiny which I feel is the jewel
in Gremlin's C-16 crown. This is  a
megamaze game which I really feel is in a
totally different class from any of the
other games. Instead of merely ﬁghting
your way through each single screen this
maze requires you to cross and recross the
same screens in your search for the Sword
of Destiny.
Master warrior Kelok has been killed
in battle by the evil warlock Xorphas. Not
content with this victory, Xorphas has
imprisoned the heart of Kelok in the
Abyss o f  Death. This means that the
warrior's soul must wander through the
Abyss forever unless he can ﬁnd the
Sword to free his heart and thereby gain
eternal peace.
The tunnels of the Abyss are locked
and Kelok must ﬁnd the ﬂashing objects
which will open each new chamber. Then
he must wander through the maze to ﬁnd
the new region and the next glowing
artefact.
Being dead has its advantages because
falling holds no fears for Kelok, a man can
only die once and he already has! His soul
can be drained of energy however, and
roaming the caverns are evil spirits. These
guardians of death must be smitten with a
bolt from Kelok's magic sword both to
save and replenish his dwindling energy.
Occasionally, Kelok will ﬁnd himself at
the foot of a shaft with no obvious exit. In
this case he must mount the rising air
currents which issue from vent5 in the
ground. Staying on the air current is no
easy task because the death's guardians
will knock him off if he carelessly collides
with them.
Will Kelok free his  heart o r  will
Xorphes' awful plan succeed? Only time
and skilful play will tell. Absolutely, the
best of the Gremlin Graphic's bunch.
I believe that Gremlin and Master-
ironic have the best C-16 collectionsavail-
able. anyone who disagrees is invited to
write and let me know and I will certainly
review their suggestions. In the meantime
I have been collecting the best of the rest
C-16 programs currently available and I'll
give these an airing next month. In the
meantime, play hard but play fair.

DMA ERROR: LOCNI
Basics
P. Green reveals some
r
I
data errors.
MOST OF YOU, AT SOME TIME OR
other must have typed in a program with
lots o f  Data statements a n d  t h e n
experienced a checksum error when the
program was run.
You are then faced with the job of
going through all the Data statements to
ﬁnd the error or errors. This is a time
consuming job and tends to get very
boring. There are, however, a few short
cuts that you can take when doing this
which should make the task easier for
you.
There are two types of error which can
crop up in Data statements. Firstly, the
number of data bytes can be incorrect.
And secondly, there can be one or more
faulty bytes of data. The ﬁrst will invariably
result in a checksum error as well.
These may seem like obvious state-
ments, but these errors have different
effects on the screen and require dif-
ferent techniques for error ﬁnding.
The ﬁrst things to be checked are the
READ and ERROR TRAP routines. Too
many data bytes will only express itself as a
checksum error i f  the READ routine
counts the data bytes. In this case the
error trap will inform you that there are
too many data bytes.
Too few data bytes will express itself in
the statement OUT OF DATA ERROR if a
FOR/TO/NEXT data entry routine is used.
If a X=X-4-1/READA/IFA OTHEN repeat
type of routine is used, then it can be
treated in the same way as too many data
bytes. After a program has been run and
the error trap has halted it, you should
obtain as much information as possible
before actually checking the data Below
is a simple error trap which I will use to
explain the procedure.
10 FOR XAIII 0100:READA
20 POKE49152-FX,A:CK=CK+A :NEXT
In order to get the required infor-
mation, type the following i n  direct
mode:
PRINT X,A,CK,PEEK(63)-0-PEEK(64)*256
'X' will tell you how many data bytes have
been entered in the case of an 'OUT OF
DATA ERROR'. 'A' will tell you the last
data byte to be entered.
The difference between 'CK' and its
correct value is very useful since if you
make a note of it and amend it as you ﬁnd
errors, it will give you an indication of
how many more errors there are.
If you examine the memory map of the
C64, you will see that locations 63 and 64
will give you the current dataline number.
This is useful since it will give you the last
data line number to be entered.
Armed w ith this  information y ou
should have an idea of the number of data
bytes too few or too many which you
have, and also the extent of the checksum
error.
Short Cuts
The ease with which you can make short
cuts depends on whether the data is for
machine code, sprites, user deﬁned
characters o r  screen memory. T he
following tips are for the C64 but should
also work for the Vic 20,
Machine Code
I will start with machine code data which
is the most difﬁcult to handle. There are
no short cuts t o  this one unless you
possess a t  least o n e  machine c ode
monitor and have some knowledge of
assembly language and the machine on
which you are working. The method is to
run the program, new it, and load your
machine code monitor. If you know the
ﬂ
area of memory into which the database
was loaded, then you can disassemble the
area to see if there are any obvious errors.
A common place for  machine code
routines to be located is a $C000 or 49152.
The success of this method will depend on
your own experience.
The reason why I prefer to use more
than one monitor is that if the m/c is at
SC0)0 then you can use one that is located
low in the memory map. If the m/c is low
in the memory then you can use a monitor
that is located high in the memory. Short
m/c programs are sometimes located in
the cassette buffer. Therefore you cannot
run the program and then load the
monitor if it is on tape. It will be necessary
to use a monitor which is located high in
the memory and then load and run the
program.
Sprites
Sprite data is one of the easiest to check,
especially if  the sprites are not multi-
colour. The procedure is as follows:
1. Temporarily put a STOP command in
the program t o  stop i t  even i f  the
checksum is OK.
2. Run the program
3. Turn sprite # 0 on -P0KE53269,1
4. Set sprite colour -P0KE53267,0
5. Enlarge sprite -P0KE53271,1
-P0KE53277,1
6. Set c o
-P0KE53249,200
7, Set sprite pointer -POKE2040,LOC
where LOC is the start location divided by
64. This c an b e  obtained fr om t he
program.
The ﬁrst sprite should now appear on
the right side of the screen. I presume that
you have a rough idea what the sprite
should look like and should be able to
spot any errors, All you have to do is make
any amendments to the data and run the
program again. Any changes in the data
should alter the sprite. Once this sprite is
OK, then increment the sprite pointer
and the next sprite should be displayed
and can be checked in the same way. This
can be done for all the sprites.

Characters
ﬁnding faults in user deﬁned character
data is nearly as easy as sprite data but may
take a little more time and more under-
standing of what you are actually doing.
Before you start you should study the
program to ﬁnd out exactly where the
data is to be stored (A common place to
store character data starts at 12288), and
what characters should be produced (are
they just modiﬁed letters or completely
new characters such as parts of a wall or a
house?). You can also ﬁnd the command
which turns the new character set ON.
This w i l l  l o o k  s o m e t h in g  l i k e
P0KE53272,28. There may be another
command to switch memory banks, but
this will make things much more compli-
cated and it probably is not worthwhile
using short cuts in this case. Then follow
these instructions:
1. Temporarily put a STOP command in
the program t o  stop i t  even i f  the
checksum is OK.
2. Run the program.
3. Turn new character set on. P0KE53272,
28 is for a character set starting at 12288.
4. The screen may now appear to have
funny characters on it, but don't panic. If
you are in any doubt, clear the screen and
return to the standard character set by
entering P0KE53272,21 and return,
5. Start typing the alphabet and note any
characters that look wrong.
6. Return to the standard character set.
Screen Memory
7. Since each character requires eight
bytes, it is not difﬁcult to ﬁnd the faulty
byte of data. For instance, if the letter 'D'
looks wrong, then, refering t o  t h e
handbook or reference guide, the data
for 'D starts at the 33rd byte of data. The
formula is 1+8*POKE No.
O. After the data has been corrected and
SAVEd, the procedure can be repeated
from instruction 2 until all the errors have
been found.
This is ﬁne if the program is for a new
character set, but what if the characters
from part of a larger object such as en-
larged characters or part of a wall or
house? The procedure is then similar to
that shown above except w ith t h e
following modiﬁcation (insert it instead of
5. above):
5. It is necessary for you to examine the
listing again, this time to ﬁnd out how the
program prints  t h e  n e w  characters.
Usually t w o  o r  more characters are
printed together to form a larger object.
This may be in a line or in a block e.g.:
abc
abc or ghij o r  defgh
hijk
You then need to print the characters
in the same way for them to make sense.
Screen memory, which usually starts at
1024, is often used t o produce a title
screen or a background picture. Screen
17
memory data is the easiest to sort out. The
method is as follows:
1. Temporarily put a STOP command on
the program t o  stop i t  even i f  the
checksum is OK.
2. Some models of the C64 require that
colour memory, which starts at 55296. is
POKEd with a character colour code. This
can be done in direct mode -  if your
program does not do this for you before
entering the data - if your program does
not do this for you before entering the
data - by typing in:
FORA=0T0999:POKE55296-1-A,1:NEXT
This will make all the POKEd characters on
the screen white.
3. Place the cursor about half way up the
screen and run the program. The screen
should then begin to ﬁll with the POKEd
characters.
4. It should then be quite 3 simple matter
for you to ﬁnd any faulty data by examin-
ing the screen with the aid of the video
memory map.
Final Word
I hope that these suggestions will make it
easier for you to type in programs from
magazines and books. These sources of
software can provide quite a lot of enjoy-
ment, both in the typing and running, and
can, if you take the trouble to try and
understand the programs. teach you quite
a lot about the use of Basic.

THE AIM OF THIS ARTICLE IS
to give a brief insight into the
world of communication using
a computer, a modem and a
telephone line and to explain
the features of the Terminal
program, published i n  con-
junction with this article.
Firstly, a modem is a piece
of electronic equipment which
is connected to the computer
via a n RS232 interface and
attached to the telephone line
via a jack plug. The name, is an
abbreviation o f  modulator/
demodulator. Its main function
is to convert data coming from
the c omputer  i n t o  audio
signals which are then trans-
mitted, along with a carrier
tone, dow n a  conventional
telephone line. The noises are
similar t o  those heard i f  a
computer tape is played back
on a standard hi-ﬁ system. Data
noises coming from the far end
work in reverse, sending data
into the computer.
The R5232 is just an inter-
face which allows the modem
to remain standard f o r  all
computers. I t  i s  only  t h e
connections w h i c h  v ar y
slightly. A t  this  stage i t  is
probably a  g o o d  id e a ,  to
examine the cost of setting up
such an operation. Modems
vary i n  price from approx-
imately £25 t o  ov er  f  200
depending o n  t h e  facilities
offered. O n  s ome o f  t h e
cheaper versions a n  R5232
interface may also be required,
the dearer ones tend to have
this already b u ilt  in t o  t he
connecting lead and are much
easier and tidier to hook up.
Before venturing into the
land of bulletin boards, the cost
of telephone calls must be
taken i n t o  ac c ount. T h e
average time o n  a  bulletin
board can vary between 15 and
40 minutes. Some boards will
set a  t ime limit -  usually
between 20 and 90 minutes -
others have no limit. Time is
something to be remembered
when a telephone bill for £100
or so drops through the letter
box (even more so i f  your
parents are paying the bill!).

We h a v e  m e n t i o n e d
bulletin boards and this may be
new to some of you, so a quick
explanation is in order. Bulletin
boards are normally set up and
run by somebody interested in
computers with enough spare
time for  the upkeep of the
system. They can b e  either
individuals or companies. The
services they  provide vary
enormously, a few examples
are: Sales and wants, technical
help, messages, jokes, stories,
uploading or downloading of
programs. Also provided can
be lists of other bulletin boards,
telephone number s  a n d
general news and interests.
Some will also have special
sections. such a s  scouting.
Some specialise in one subject
such as medicine, mail order
stock etc. We shall come back
to bulletin boards later but now
let's tak e a  look  a t  what
modems have to offer.
Baud Rates
The standard baud rates are
usually 300/300, 1200/75 o r
75/1200.
Auto Dialling
This is a fairly obvious one. The
number t o  b e  c alled c an
usually be typed in  on the
computer k ey boar d. T h e
autodial then takes over and
pulses the number out. Some
are able to redial if the number
is busy or  try several times
before giving up.
Auto Answer
This will recognise the ringing
coming in on the telephone
line and send a signal to
a) start the computer program

b) answer the telephone line
and connect the computer.
When o n ly  o n e  line is
available for both normal calls
and modem calls, a  caller
wishing only to speak will be
answered b y  t h e  modem's
high-pitched tone and will be
cut off after a set time if no
incoming carrier is detected.
Self Test
Again, this one speaks for itself.
Normally, this is a switch, push
button or moveable link which
connects t h e  transmit and
receive circuits together giving
a loop back into the computer.
This enables you to send data.
receive the data you have sem
and display it on your screen.
This is a quick and easy way to
test the program and the RS232
interface.
Indicator Lights
If you examine all the modems
available, you will notice that
some h a v e  s ev eral l i t t l e
indicator lights. These can have
a variety of purposes. the most
common being: power on,
transmit and receive data,
carrier OK and on line. Most of
which are self explanatory.
The bas ic  mo d e m w i l l
simply offer 300/300 CCITT V21
standard, originate only . A
typical British Telecom modem
13A offers these facilities, with
the addition of self test. It can
cost as little as i45 and is avail-
able with full instructions and
fully tes ted f r o m  D is t e l
Electronics. Also required is an
R5232 interface available from
Maplin Electronics.
The most common baud
rate is 300/300, This refers to
the speed at which data is trans-
mitted a n d  rec eiv ed a n d
therefore 1200/1200 is  four
times faster.
The 1200/75 is a split baud
rate where the board sends out
at 1200 bits per second and
waits for a reply which you
send at 75 bits per second. The
reverse would apply where
75/1200 is shown.
As the 1200/1200 baud rate
is more prone to data corrup-
tion, the 75/1200 or 1200/75
rates are preferred. This also
means that time can be saved
(phone bill again) when re-
ceiving or transmitting data at
the 1200 baud rate. Since the
response from the receiver -
the end sending at 75 -  is

normally only  a  single key
selection, even 75 baud rate is
quite fast enough. Most boards
run at 300/8/1, This refers to
the baud rate, parity and stop
bits.
Setting Up
Set the computer up with the
modem plugged in and the
program running. Dial up the
required number and, if the
carrier tone is returned, switch
the modem to data or on line.
The carrier tone which you
hear from the distant end is
normally a  high- pitc hed
whistle. After  switching the
modem fr om Telephone t o
data, it may be necessary to hit
the return key a  couple of
times. This will depend on the
type of board to which you are
connecting.
Most bulletin boards have a
welcome screen, as shown in
Figure 1, This will sometimes
tell y ou the hours and the
protocols (baud rate, parity,
stop bills etc.) needed, but all
boards will vary.
At some stage i t  should
come up with FIRST NAME?
Understandably, most board
operators do not like false or
silly names. They have not
supplied a  lot o f  expensive
equ .
for people to abuse the system
and take advantage of a free
service. Whilst on this note of
abuse, it should be noted that
many of the earlier boards have
closed down or are beginning to
charge a subscription fee for
their services. The main reason
for this  is  that people are
swearing or simply try to crash
the program which can cause
untold damage to the ﬁles and
in s o m e  cases a ls o  t h e
ha-dware. It must be borne in
mind that you are a guest to the
system and should behave in a
responsible manner. It is our
hope that communicating by
computer will not go the way of
many C R  channels wher e
appalling language and abuse
are the norm.

boards will require you to press
return y o u  will be asked to
enter y our  last name. The
board will then proceed t o
check its ﬁles to see if you are a
registered user, Several things
may now happen:
a) If you need to be a registered
user you may well be cut off.

b) If you are a registered user, it
will tell you from where you are
calling and request that you
enter a password_ On receipt of
your password it will connect
you to the system. It will then
check if there are any messages
waiting for you.
c) If you are not registered it
will probably ask you to ﬁll in a
questionnaire ready for you to
use on your next call.
As already mentioned, all
boards vary, so for now we will
concentrate o n  o n e  i n
particular.
Terminal Program
The Terminal Program featured
in this issue is approximately
14.5K long and there now
follows an explanation of the
facilities it offers.
It is  a  completely menu
driven pr ogr am w i t h  t h e
option to use tape or disk. The
screen colours can be changed
to any of those available on the
C64 and the border and text
colours can also be altered to
suit your requirements.
The printer option can be
used w i t h  e it h e r  dev ic e
number four or device number
six - the printer plotter.
A 30K buffer for  down-
loading incoming data from
the board is switchable whilst
on line and this data can then
be saved t o  tape or disk. A
screen full of data, such as the
menu, can be saved straight
into m e m o r y  f o r  f u t u r e
reference or likewise be saved
to tape or disk. These screens
and buffers can then be printed
out for a hard copy of your visit
to the board.
Since many  boards ar e
different, there is  also the
facility to set up baud ﬁle. This
ﬁle is similar to a mini database
i.e. name, telephone number,
baud rates and Macro if any.
When the baud ﬁle which you
have selected is loaded in, this
will automatically set them up
with the required protocols.
Another option available is
the ability to pretype a message
before going on line, which
will drastically cut down time
on line and consequently your
phone bill. One key will then
send out the message at the
same t ime as  y ou receive
incoming data. This is  very
handy when you need to send
the same information to a lot of
different people.

This could be used as a form of
Help Screen whilst on line. For
instance when bulletin boards
list their functions there could
be some differences since not
all systems use the same keys.
Some Boards use P for pause
some us e Space Bar  etc .
Pressing Fl when the menu is
displayed will give you a handy
reference guide.
F2 will allow you to view the
above saved screen whilst on
line. If you press El again, the
screen is lost and replaced by
the next screen saved. At this
stage it might be as well to use
F7. This will save the screen
straight to disk or tape so that
you can print out at a later date
and have a hard copy.
F3 — Toggle Buffer On
This will allow you to allocate a
30K Buffer (block of memory)
which w ill save t h e  entire
Data that has come in and gone
out whilst on line. This is useful
if you wish to relive the whole
of your time on line without

By pressing FS i n  Terminal

Title: Com m odore Reference
Diary
Author: Jim Butterﬁeld
Publisher: Pitman Publishing
Price: £3.95
THE COMMODORE REFERENCY DIARY
by Jim Butterﬁeld may be only pocket sized
but i t  holds  something f o r  every
Commodore programmer.
Starting with a  description o f  the
Commodore range from the venerable
PET to the IBM compatible PC and the full
range o f  peripherals, t h e  reference
section launches into an overview of the
main elements of Basic.
The next section looks at the memory
architecture o f  each machine, giving
detailed memory maps of the principal
elements a n d  memor y  loc ations ,
including the ﬁrst breakdown of the C128
which I have seen.
A SuperChart of character, keyword
and mnemonic codes in decimal and hex
forms a  useful conversion chart f o r
quickly translating ASCII codes in t o
screen poke values or for disassembling
Basic loaders and many other serious
applications.
A whole section is given to several
short programs which are useable on any
Commodore machine with a few minor
alterations, inc luding a  s imple PET
emulator for the C64.
Frequency tables and a few hints and
tips on sound generation on the Vic 20 or
C64 are then followed by a table of colour
codes for these machines and the Plus/4
and C-16. This in turn is followed by a brief
look at machine code mnemonics and
addressing modes and the section closes
with a glossary of computer terms.
As y ou mig h t  expect f r o m t h e
Maharishi of Commodore machines, the
diary is aimed at the serious programmer
and has already proved to be a handy
source of information for me. A ﬁne gift
for the programmer who thinks he has
everything.
Title: Tool Kit: Kemal

Publisher: Compute! Books/Holt
Saunders
Price: 03.95
COMPUTE! GAZETTE IS A RATHER EXP-
ensive American magazine which is a
mine o f  information for  Commodore.
Apple and Atari users, and Computers
books of abstracts for each machine are
always good value for money.
Tool Kit: Kernal may sound like a
collection of utility programs but it is a
description of the ROM kernal routines at
the end of the memories of the C64 and
Vic 20.
compurv,
Tool Kit:
Kemal
The book is not fully self-contained
and Computers Tool Kit: Basic, which
deals with the Basic ROM, along with a
full disassembly of the kernal memory
would be a useful companion to help gain
the full beneﬁt fr om the wealth o f
information contained in this book.
Each chapter is a grouping of  the
various subroutines in 'family' groups. For
example, all the tape I/O routines form a
large chapter which not only describes
the routines but explains the way in which
a tape ﬁle is structured. Other chapters
deal in a similar way with interrupts and
system reset, screen, serial I/O, RS-232
and principal kernal routines.
Apart from giving details of the sub-
routines and their relatives, there is a
smattering of hints and tips and short
useful programs which demonstrate how
the kernal may be used within your own
projects.
The routines are listed in memory
order and abbreviated groupings in two
ﬁnal appendices but a more standard
index would have improved the facilities
offered by this very useful book.

Title: T h e  Sec ond B o o k  o f
Machine Language
Author: Richard Mansﬁeld
Publisher: Compute! Books/Holt
Saunders
Price: 02.95
IF MACHINE LANGUAGE FOR BEGIN-
tiers was an introduction to the vocabulary
oﬁmachine code,then this book ls.an essay
on the grammar of the language. More
than this, working through the book grad-
ually builds u p  a powerful assembler
program which not only teaches the basics
of machine code programming structure
but also acts as a useful addition to your
utility library f o r  creating y our own
routines and programs.
As t he name suggests, the Label
Assembler Development System (LADS)
allows the use of labels and comments
within a  program which looks like a
normal Basic program except that it uses
its own mnemonic language based on
normal machine code mnemonics.
This forms a much easier way to con-
struct a machine code program and not
being in code itself means that it can be
used to show many of the facets of pro-
gramming including communicating with
peripheral devices and maintaining a
database.
The book is written in  intelligent
English which assumes nothing more than
a bit of common sense and perseverance
on the part of the reader. Perseverance
comes in useful because you have to enter
several pages of data which lacks the
customary checksum features of other
books in the Compute! series.
An appendix of useful subroutines for
incrementing, adding and subtracting
double b y t e  numbers , multi- by te
addition and multiplication and division

adequately cover areas which can be
problematic to beginners.
Undoubtedly, the contents o f  this
book offers great value for money to
anyone interested in a good introduction
to machine language.
Title: Peeks and Pokes Com -
modore 64
Author: Data Becker Books
Publisher: First Publishing
Price: £7.95
THE MO ST  DIFFICULT WORDS T O
understand in the Basic language must be
PEEK and POKE which is a pity, because
programming the 64 to any degree of
competence soon necessitates their use.
Stripping away some of  the mystique
surroundings these words is the aim of
this book from First Publishing.
Starting off with the general basics of
computer memory it  soon leaps into
speciﬁc examples on the kind of infor-
mation which can be obtained by peeking

dround the machine and how pokes can
be used to great effect. The whole of the
RAM operating system is scrutinised as
the chapters progress with sections on
zero page locations, sound and graphics.
Realising that peeks and pokes are the
basis of machine code, allows the author
to give a gentle introduction to machine
language. Basic extensions and games
routines. I must stress however that this is
just an introduction, not an in-depth
study, of these subjects for those who
wish to understand the principles without
getting too involved in detail.
In some ways I think that the book tries
to cover too much in too short a space and
the clear explanations which typify the
opening chapters give way to a more
fuzzy style in the latter part of the book. A
painfully slow machine code simulator is
included which covers an area better
suited to a good machine code monitor
with trace facilities.
Despite these criticisms, the book has

[WIlen Webb with
more from the
fascinating world of
[sprites.
YOU CAN MOAN AS MUCH
as you like about the poor Basic
of the C64 but one area which
gives it great advantages over
many other machines is the
provision o f  sprites. These
objects are the life blood of
many games authors (jus t
watch o n e  o f  M r  Minter's
games) and can make life very
simple. The draw back, as ever,
is that a fairly large number of
POKEs are necessary t o  get
them to do anything. In this
article I will provide a set of
routines which will enable you
to manipulate sprites with ease.
You w i l l  notic e that I
haven't provided a command
for the design of sprites. The
reason is that such commands
are ridiculously wasteful o n
memory. If you want to include
sprite designs in your program.
I suggest the use of DATA state-
ments or  a straight block of
data. Most of the decent sprite
designer programs ar ound
enable you to do one or the
other (some offer both).
As always, t h e  c ode is
loaded fr om a  Basic loader
(Loader 1) and sits in the spare
area between ROMs starting at
SC000. T h e  commands ar e
called from a jump table at the
start of the code. In summary,
the calls are:
1. Specify Sprite
SYS SA, SN, Type, Colour, Xexp,
Yexp, p r io r it y ,  [ c o lo u r l,
colour21
Where:
SN is the sprite number (0-7).
Type is  the graphics mode
0=high resolution, 1=multi-
colour.
Colour is the sprite colour
Xexp, Yexp are ﬂags for sprite
expansion, 0=nor mal, 1 =
expanded.
Priority is 0 for sprites behind
text and 1 for sprites in front.
Colour1 and colour2 are the
other colours, only required if
type=1.
This command sets up the main
parameters for any sprite.
2. On/Oft
SYS SA+3,SN,Flag
where SN is the sprite involved.
Flag is1 to turn on a sprite and 0
to turn it off.
3. Position Sprite
SYS SA+6,SN,X,Y
This commands puts a sprite SN
at co-ordinates X and Y.
4. Pattern
SYS SA+9,SN,Slot Number
This command sets the sprite
pointer for sprite SN to the
pattern slot speciﬁed.
5. Erase
SYS SA+12,Slot Number
This erases t h e  speciﬁed
pattern slot.
6. Fill
SYS SA+15,Slot Number, Byte
value
This ﬁlls the pattern with the
speciﬁed byte value.
7. Reverse
SYS SA+18,Slot Number
This reverses t h e  speciﬁed
pattern so that dots become
spaces and spaces become
dots.
8. Copy
SYS SA+21,Slot N u m b e r ,
pattern address, ﬂag
This copies a  pattern o f  63
bytes, starting at the speciﬁed
address to the speciﬁed pattern
slot. The ﬂag determines how
the pattern and the contents of
the slot are combined:
0 - overwrites the contents of
the pattern slot
28
1 -  EORs the pattern slot
2 - ORs the pattern slot
3 - ANDs the pattern slot
9. Roll Left
SYS SA+24,Slot N u m b e r ,
number of shifts
This mov es  t h e  speciﬁed
pattern t o  the left and the
pattern reappears on the right
to give a roll. The number of
shifts decides how much is
scrolled a n d  a llo w s  t h e
scrolling of multicolour sprites
without odd colour effects (by
using a n  ev en number  o f
shifts).
10. Roll Right
SYS SA+27, Slot Number ,
number of shifts
11. Randomise
SYS SA-I-30,Slot Number
Fills the speciﬁed pattern slot
with a random pattern.
12. Invert
SYS 5A+33,Slot Number
Turns the speciﬁed pattern slot
upside down.
13. Sprite/Sprite Collision
SYS SA+36,SN
Checks the collision status of
sprite SN and returns a value in
location 1000. A  zero value
means no collision, a non zero
value means a collision.
14. Sprite/Background
Collision
SYS SA+39,SN
Acts in the same way as the
sprite/sprite collision but uses
location 1001.
15. Animate
SYS SA+,Slot Number, Start
Address, Number o f  frames,
delayl,delay2
This displays a  sequence of
designs in the speciﬁed pattern
slot. The start address of the
patterns is speciﬁed and the
patterns mus  f ollow  as  a
sequence of 64 bytes. The delay
values determine the anima-
tion speed. The approximate
times to display eight frames
are:
D1*132 Ti m e  to display 8
frames (jifﬁes)
2500 1 0
5000 1 5
10000 ' 2 9
40000 1 0 9
62500 1 6 8
This demonstration shows the
use of the animate command to
show a man walking across the
room. When he hits the wall,
the explosion effect uses the
randomise and scroll c om-
mands. D o n ' t  for get t h a t
before you use the collision
detect commands, you must
clear the collision registers at
the start of the program (Line
120 of the demonstration does
this). If you omit this step, you
will g e t  spurious c ollis ion
effects.
Most of you will be content to
use the normal set of sprites. In
fact this set allows a reasonably
long Basic program. If you want
a longer program, you have
two options:
1) Use an alternative memory
bank and screen position. The
machine c ode automatically
takes the screen position into
account when setting the sprite
pointers.
2) Simply store y our sprite
patterns abov e t h e  Basic
memory with the top of Basic
dropped to protect them. You
can t h e n  u s e  t h e  CO PY
command t o  ex trac t t h e
patterns.
Option one is probably best
if you want to use eight sprites
on screen at once.

C 8 4
I suggest you look at the
Programmer's Refer enc e
Guide for information on how
to change banks and screen
position. Given the energy and
time, t r y  to cover this matter
in a later article.
Well, that's it for this month.
Next month, perhaps a little
snippet on 3D graphics for you
lovers of mazes and dungeons
and dragons.

More on the mysterie
of machine code from
Allen Webb.
SO, W H A T  EXACTLY I S
machine code? Well it's a set of
instructions which the micro-
processor can carry out. These
instructions are stored as eight
bit number s , s o  t h a t  a
maximum of 256 instructions
are available. I n  reality, the
number o f  instructions i s
signiﬁcantly less than 256.
Each instruction, o r  o p -
code, may be followed by an
eight o r  16 b it  data value
(operand) depending on the
type a n d  m o d e  o f  t h e
instruction. Each c omplete
instruction w i l l  ther efor e
occupy one, two or three bytes.
We humans ar e basically
stupid creatures a n d  it ' s
obviously not feasible to write
machine code directly as a
sequence o f  numbers, Each
instruction is  therefore rep-
resented by a mnemonic which
aids pr ogr amming. Some
examples of mnemonics are:
LDA - LoaD Accumulator
TAX - Transfer Accumulator to
X register
The example giv en las t
month shows t h e  us e o f
mnemonics. W e  c an n o w
outline the programming steps
involved i n  writing machine
code:
1. Using an editor, write a
program using mnemonics and
labels to ease the process. This
is called the SOURCE CODE.
2. Convert the source code to
the numeric al instructions
(OBJECT CODE) whic h ar e
used by  the processor. This
conversion is performed by the
assembler,
3. load, debug and use the
object code.
That's all there is to it. Many
people try to attach a lot of
mystery a n d  difﬁc ulty  t o
machine code but provided
you use a disciplined approach,
machine code programming is
not complicated.
Before we start work, it's
time t o  adopt s ome n e w
attitudes t o  programming.
First, forget all the bad habits
that you may have learnt with
Basic. Basic may tolerate sloppy
programming, machine code

won't. If you ﬁll the stack, for
example, Basic will give you an
OUT OF MEMORY error -
machine code will crash.
Here are some tips:
1. Before y ou start coding,
prepare a  detailed program
algorithm o r  ﬂowsheet o n
paper.
2. If the program is large, split it
up into small, easily debugged
modules.
3. Use copious amounts o f
remarks to tell you the function
of each section of the program
and k eep a  track o f  what
actions each module performs
and which registers/memory
locations are affected.
4. Save y our  source c ode
regularly to prevent the loss of
hours of work by a crash.
5. Keep smiling!
Compared t o  high level
languages, mac hine c o d e
instructions are rather primi-
tive and quite a number are
required t o  perform simple
tasks. This does explain why
Basic is so sluggish but it is also
what makes machine c ode
versatile a n d  o f t e n  q u it e
compact.
32
The instructions mainly
involve t h e  movement and
manipulation of data, with the
various registers operating in a
simple hierarchy as implied in
Figure 1.
1. The ALU is the big boy of the
system being able to perform
actions on both RAM and the
other registers.
2. Next down the heap comes
the accumulator which is able
to act on RAM and the X and Y
registers.
3. The X and Y registers can
transfer data from RAM or the
accumulator but are limited in
power.
4. Finally, RAM has no capab-
ilities and simply acts as a series
of boxes for the storage of data.
All data transfers are carried
out via the accumulator or X
and Y registers. The type of data
transfer depends  o n  t h e
"addressing m o d e " .  T h e
6502/6510 have 13 addressing
modes making them quite
versatile.
OK, let's make a start on the
commands f o r  loading and
saving the eight bit  internal
registers.
$0004
The simplest addressing
mode is immediate mode. This
mode involves the loading of a
speciﬁed data value int o a
register and is signiﬁed by pre-
ﬁxing the data value b #. For
example:
IDA #20
This insertion loads t h e
accumulator with 20. The X and
Y registers can also be used in
immediate mode:
LDA $ A0  (loads the X register
with hex $A0 (160))
LDY #%00000001 (loads the Y
register with binary 1)
A slightly more advanced
mode allows the manipulation
of the contents of a speciﬁed
memory location. This is called
abs olute m o d e .  I f  t h e
operande is not preﬁxed by # ,
this mode is assumed. Here are
some examples:
LDA 1 0 2 4   -  l o a d s  t h e
accumulator with the contents
of location 1024.
LDY $8000 loads the Y register

0 6 4
M O IN IM I• • • • •
a

d

so
i T J
with the contents of location
$8000.
The contents of a register
may also be stored to a memory
location in absolute mode.
STA $0400 -  s tores  t h e
ztcumulator in location $0400.
SIX 1000 - stores the X register
in location 1000.
Cons ider t h i s  r a t h e r
contrived example:
20 C000 *4C000
30 C000 A9 01 WA  ft 1
40 C002 8D 00 04 STA $0400
SO COOS AC 00 04 LDY $0400
60 C008 8C 00 D8 STY SD800
70 COOB 60 RTS
This e x a m p le  d o e s  t h e
following:
LINE 10 -  Loads the accumu-
lator with the valuel. This uses
immediate mode.
LINE 20 -  Stores the accumu-
lator in location 1024 (i.e. abso-
lute mode). In other words.
location 1024 now holds 1.
LINE 30 - Loads the Y register
with the contents of 1024, i.e. 1.
LINE 40 - Stores the Y register in
location $1)800.
This program is equivalent to:
POKE 1024,1: POKE 55296,1
but is much faster.
Before y o u  experts o u t
there put in  the boot, this
example routine is deliberately
inefﬁcient to simply show the
use of immediate and absolute
addressing modes.
Let us have a quick look at
line 40. The machine code and
mnemonics are:
8D 00 04 STA $0400
The ﬁrst hexadecimal byte,
SSD, is the code for the instruc-
tion Store Accumulator i n
absolute mode. The second
two bytes are the address of
the loc ation inv olv ed b u t
reversed i.e. 00 04 is  $0400
backwards. This is a convention
adopted b y  this  particular
processor and is  something
which we will meet again.
The instruction RTS in line
70 stands for ReTurn from Sub-
routine. This is similar to ihe
Basic word RETURN.
The processor considers the
memory to comprise of a series
of 256 byte "pages". The most
important page is the block of
memory from $0000 to SOM.
This is called the "zero" page
and i t  has its  ow n set o f
addressing modes. Any decent
assembler w i l l  c hec k  t h e
operand for a value in the zero
page and assign the appropriate
op-code value. Apart from the
size of the operand, zero page
address mode is written in the
same way as normal absolute
mode E.G.
AD 00 04 LDA $0400- non zero
page
AS 40 LDA $0040 - zero page
The value o f  zero page
addressing is that it is faster. A
normal absolute accumulator
load for  example takes four
microsounds whilst a zero page
load three microseconds on a
one megahertz computer.
The importance of the zero
page is reﬂected in its extensive
use by  the BASIC operating
system. The zero page also
features strongly in the more
cunning addressing modes.
The last of the simple data
transfer commands involves
the accumulator and the two
registers. These are quite self
explanatory:
TAX -  transfer the contents of
the accumulator t o  t h e  X
register.
TAY -  transfer the contents of
the accumulator t o  t h e  Y
register.
TXA -  transfer the contents of
the X  r e g is t e r  t o  t h e
accumulator.
TYA - transfer the contents of
the Y  r e g is t e r  t o  t h e
accumulator.
In fact these instructions
perform a copying action and
both registers involved w ill
contain the same contents. For
example. assume that you want
to load both the accumulator
33
and the Y register with 255. The
following sequence will do the
job:
IDA*, $FF
TAY
Alternatively, y ou c ould
use:
LDA# SFF
LDY $FF or:
LDY $FF
TVA
There is  little t o  choose
between the three examples
except that the ﬁrst and last
occupy o n l y  t hr ee by tes
(compared t o  t h e  second
which uses four bytes). The
second example is also slightly
slower.

location (e.g. 1000).
3. Write a routine to rapidly
ﬂash the screen with the colour
sequence RED, CYAN a n d

SOFTIMRE FOR
Save your ﬁngers a lot of
work with our new software
service.
IT'S THREE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING.
You sit at the computer keyboard having
just ﬁnished a marathon typing session
entering one of the superb programs
from Your Commodore. Your ﬁngers
reach for the keyboard and press the
letters R ,  U  and N I .  You s it back
expectantly and...nothing happens.
Well, I'm sure that we have all had
problem before now. When i t  does
happen it's a matter of spending hours
searching through the program for any
typing mistakes. No matter how long you
look or how many people help you, you
can usually guarantee that at least one
little bug slips through unnoticed.
Here, at Your Commodore, we pride
ourselves on the quality of listing that we
print. Unfortunately, this usually means
that they are also very long, thus taking
longer to type in and leaving more room
for errors. All o f  the listings in Your
Commodore are taken straight from a
printout o f  working programs, i t  is
therefore very unusual f o r  errors t o
appear in the magazine.
Because of the length of our programs
we do get a large number of requests from
readers who would like us to put speciﬁc
programs on tape or  disk for  them.
Obviously this is very time consuming and
means that we can't spend as much time
working on the magazine as we would
like.
We are therefore proud to announce
the start of the Your Commodore Soft-
ware Service'. Most of the programs from
each issue of the magazine will now be
34
available on a single cassette for a price of
just [4.00. We will not be making disks
available since they would have to be a lot
more expensive and more difﬁcult to
post. This  shouldn't cause y ou any
problems though as none of the programs
will be protected and it will be a simple
matter t o  save the programs t o  disk
yourselves.
All programs on the cassette will be
saved us ing a  tape tur bo routine.

However, we cannot guarantee that all
programs will work correctly with this
turbo routine present. W e  therefore
recommend that before you use any of
the programs you make a copy of the
programs on your own cassette or disk
and use this version of the program not
the original.

COMMUNICATION
[David Janda keeps you in
'touch with the services which
l
I HAVE HAD QUITE A FEW MAILBOXES
from subscribers o n  Mic r onet and
Compunet about the subject of costs. So,
besides the usual banter and news. I
would like to express in general terms and
views of the subscribers, Micronet and
Compunet on this sensitive subject.
Value Added Services
What ar e they? Well, Micronet and
Compunet are Value Added Networks
(VANs). That is , besides t h e  'usual'
services such as  mailboxing, system
information such as directories and soon,
they also provide the subscriber with
other goodies such as Micronet's Starnet,
or Compunet's Multi User Dungeon
(MUD). This type of goodie is called a
Value Added Service (VAS).
The type o f  mailbox I  have been
getting goes along the lines of; 'Why
should I pay X amount for such-and-such
when I ' v e  already paid Y  pounds
subscribing to the thing in the ﬁrst place?'
A fair question.
Talking to Micronet's mega-star Public
Relations Manager, Peter Probert gave
me M'Net's side o f  the story. Peter
explained that when M'Net ﬁrst started it
had no VASs. The info on the system was
supplied as  part o f  the subscription.
However, the more elaborate features
such as Starnet, Gallery and the Daisychats
cost a lot to develop and maintain as far as
administration is concerned. Micronet is
not in business to rip-off its subscribers,
but neither is it a registered charity.
M'Net's Technical Guru and VAS
manager, M i k e  Br own, t o ld  Your
Commodore; "The extremes are that we
could have no subscription and charge for
every page looked at, or we could have a
very high subscription and no charge for
any of the services. We prefer to strike a
balance between the two."
As far as users are concerned, they can
use the regular 'free' facilities of M'Net
such as the news and user bases, and have
the choice of using the services that cost.
Development wise, it's easy to think that
M'Net would be tempted to spend more
time/effort in developing VASs, but this
would not appear to be the case. Bizznet,
AlQ. the Sunday mag arid the Amiga
section are new or newish sections which
do not cost anything.
Jane Fairbank, Editor of Compunet,
told Your Commodore much the same
thing. Jane emphasised the calories it
takes t o  dev elop a  n e w  service;
"Something like Party-line takes a lot of
time and money to develop." she said.
Having used the MUD and Party-Line
links, I can believe it.
But what about the costs of a VAS?
Well, Micronet charges 99p per Gallery
frame and lop to edit a frame. Starnet
costs 99p to register and 25p per move.
The Round Britain Race costs 1/2p per
move and Daisychat 2p per message.
Compunet charges i1.75 per hour for
MUD and ﬂ per hour for Party-line. The
one-off link charge for MUD or Party-line
costs 50p. You can buy a MUD or party-
line permanent link for i7.99 and 15.95
respectively.
Needless to say, both Micronet and
Compunet justiﬁed t h e  costs when
questioned; the question is do you think
they are justiﬁed? Please write or mailbox
and let me know.
Here is the News
Micronet —  I  have raved o n about
Sta met, the Net's interactive Space Game
before in this column, and I heard that the
Net is  considering another interactive
game along the lines of Stocks and Shares.
The idea being that you buy and sell
according to rules, form cartels and so on.
I hope the idea becomes reality, sounds
good. At the time of writing, BT's version
of MUD is undergoing Beta tests, I have
been informed that once the game is up
and running proper, there will be a route
to MUD from Micronet.
A couple of new areas on the Net
should be active by the time you read this.
First, the Amiga will have its own area
where you will ﬁnd articles about it. A.
Sunday Supplement type of magazine will
appear i n  the news index over the
weekends. I'm not sure of the contents,
but a regular Sci-Fi story and a column
written by some voyeur (a what?) of the
computer industry is promised.
Finally, it is hoped that the Quickchat
channels will be fully debugged by the
end o f  this  month. Each Quickchat
window will be split into four parts, each
showing a message and being up-dated
before your very eyes. An option to back-
track is also promised.
Compunet —  J ane F air bank
conﬁrmed that CNET is considering a
home banking service, but would not give
any more away. She also said that a Telex
link is  possible, but again would not
conﬁrm or let on. What is conﬁrmed is a
new area for the C128 aimed at the more
serious user. A  major re-grouping of
directories and tidying up should have
been completed by  now, and faster
response times for  the whole of the
system should be the norm.
Having difﬁculty remembering all
those GOTO numbers? Well, an alpha-
numeric GOTO on the Duckshoot is now
implemented. Instead of entering 107701.
you should be able to enter NEW, or
NEWS or MUD or whatever! Users who
operate popular areas will most likely ﬁnd
that editorial assistance and ﬁnancial help
(free uploads) are being offered to them
— about time too.
Party-line Mk  II is now operational
with separate 'rooms' enabling you to see
who is in them. P-line 2 has a D&D *DICE
command allowing users to play D&D.
Contact Yeti o n AL2 if  you want t o
organise a game.
Eyeball
On M'Net? Then try the new Quickchats
at *811. Check out the new Sunday
magazine and do yousell a favour and
register as a  Star Captain o n Starnet
*800030000. C'Netters c an check out
VV.E.E.T. (155806) for a great magazine by
512. If you're into comms news, CNET and
hard facts reporting, the Dave Martin's
MEGA SCENE at 110832 is guaranteed to
interest you.
Next m o n t h ,  m o r e  lies  a n d  a
refreshing look  at the Bulletin Board
scene in and around the UK! Until then,
please drop me a line, rope or whatever
on Prestek 919992677 and Compunet ID
WAND A.
Compunet Answers
Jane Fairbanks of Compunet puts CNet's
point of view.
The present Party-Line link is a very
sophisticated piece of specially written
software, with windowing, scrolling, save
and print facilities.
It was offered at 10p as an introductory
price, but has now gone up to 50p but at
the same time a free dumb teletype link
has become available. This is a standard
piece of software and does not have any
of the facilities described above. But it
means people will have the option of
using the advance link or the basic one.
We have the same situation in MUD.
Until recently, that was only useable with
a dumb teletype link, which was and still
is free. But a similarly advanced terminal is
again available at 50p for those who chose
to use it.
In both cases, people intending to use
the advanced links frequently can buy
and subsequently pre-load, or load on-
line, the link as a piece of software; this
naturally means they do not have to pay
the 50p.
The present P-Line link now costs 50p
and the free terminal is now available. If
you compare the two it will be abundantly
obvious what people are paying for with
the advanced link. P-Line itself will soon
gain new facilities, notably 'rooms' and a
bulletin board_

When you are designing a game one of the longest jobs is de-
signing the sprites. If you are good at art then ﬁne, if not your
next monster will probably end up looking like a square box
with legs.
Now, Your Commodore comes to the rescue once again
with Sprite Ideas. If you have designed any sprites for games
and you don't mind other people seeing your masterworks
then why not send them into us. Each month we will be offering
00 for the best entries.
Your sprites can be anything at all (within reason), if you've
designed a series of animated characters then send in the lot.
We'd love to have a look at them.
So, next time you are after an Ogre to put in your new game,
have a look in this section of the magazine and you may ﬁnd
just what you are looking for.

Margaret Webb has been - -
[inside her CM to bring you I
this month's column.
IN RECENT MONTHS I'VE DEVOTED each
article to speciﬁc areas such as music,
adventures and graphics. This month, just
for a change, I plan to describe a handful
of miscellaneous items of software which
cover different topics.
The ﬁrst item, D-Bug (Ariolasoft),
appeared to be simply a game but it trans-
pires that it is a pretty good piece of
educational material which teaches a little
about the structure of computers. The
idea is quite novel. You are attempting to
play a game called Gotcha in a software
generated computer. This is a tactical
game in which you endeavour to force
the opponent to take your pieces on a
grid playing area. The only problem is that
the 'computer' keeps developing bugs.
Using the symptoms shown in the video
output or the sound, you must dive into
the interior of the computer and rectify
the fault. This entails replacing or nudging
an awkward chip or other appropriate
action. The game is both colourful and
noisy and combined with the compre-
hensive instructions gives a decent intro-
duction t o  c omputer architecture.
Probably best suited to the nine to 13 age
group.
A frequent feature of the software
market is the appearance of 'licensed'
software based on ﬁlms. Some appears to
be quite good, some of it pretty rough.
Bearing this is mind, it was with some
trepidation that I  loaded The Never-
ending Story from Ocean. Fortunately,
my fears were generally unfounded. This
is a text/graphics adventure supplied as a
two cassette package. The game is split
into three sections and you may only
progress once you have completed a
section. OK, so what has this to do with
education, you all shout. Well, if you had
read my article on adventures a couple of
months ago, you would know the answer.
So what's it like? Well, my better half,
who's a bit of an adventure freak (well it
keeps him off the streets!), thinks it's the
prettiest game for  yards around. I'm
inclined to agree with him. The illum-
inated 'gothic' text style is nicely en-
hanced with some pretty multicolour
high resolution pictures. These pictures
not only show your location but also what
you're carrying. When you start to play,
however, the content doesn't quite live
011•118
up to the graphics. The apparent lack of
interaction with the other characters
(they kept running away!) and the limited
vocabulary tend to make the play a little
irritating. The story line and the graphics
are certain, however, t o  appeal t o
younger players.
Most of you will have seen the US Gold
trademark on a wide range of American
software. Our friends at US Gold are now
marketing a range of Walt Disney material
on a label called Kids. As far as I'm aware,
three titles are now generally available.
The only one I've seen to date is Donald
Duck's Playground (the others involve
Winnie the Pooh and the Muppets -  I
hope t o  see these soon. The game
involves the erection of an adventure
playground for  Donald's nephews. As
with most of life, nothing comes free, and
you must earn cash in order to purchase
the component parts of the playground.
Four jobs are available to Donald each
STORY
HOUSE
41
a
utilising a different skill. The airport job
involves matching letters and at the toy
shop you must match shapes. Unloading
the fruit lorry is more of a test of dexterity
and controlling the train system requires
logic and lateral thought. Some may
object to the use of dollars and cents but
since we also use a decimal system, this
isn't too much of a problem.
Not surprisingly, the graphics are to a
high standard and the use of sound is
adequate. Overall, a nice product which is
ideal f o r  t h e  pre-school/infants age
group.
The •ﬁnal piece o f  software, Story
House - Creative Sparks, is also aimed at
the younger age group. The idea is to help
children to read by allowing them to build
up illustrated stories. The program is
multiple choice and allows the selection
of the characters in the story, their names
and other details. The game can b e
replayed at regular intervals and can be
saved o n  cassette for  repeat perfor-
mances. The graphics are quite pretty
with the characters appearing as animated
sprites. (the antics of the cat, frog etc.
illicited great jollity from my ﬁve year old
son). Again, ideal for pre-school children
(although the package quotes ﬁve to nine
years) and will keep kids quiet whilst mum
gets on with whatever she does.
Well folks, thats all for this month. I do
hope that I've given you some ideas to
help you keep your children busy and
learning.

[f_rogs and Frenchmen
in this month's
installment of our
[exciting arcade game
series. By Daryl
[Bowers.
FIRSTLY, IN THIS MONTHS
exciting episode, we've got
some more sprite data to type
in. This is entered using the
routine which I gave you in part
one — the start address being
13312 and number o f  bytes
being 1024. This should b e
saved as FROGDAT2_ This data
contains all the rest o f  the
sprites required for the game.
Now on to the exciting bit!
Line 1530 contains a jump to
the bic y c le pr int ing a n d
moving routine, CYCLE, which
we will come to later. The ﬁrst
routine, how ev er , i s  a n
extension o f  t h e  r outine
ROADF ILL.
The v ar iable CRATER
contains t h e  n u m b e r  o f
characters of a puddle left to
print, or, if zero, it indicates that
there is no puddle and that a
normal piece of road should be
inserted on to the right hand
side of the screen. If a puddle is
to be inserted (character 102)
then it  is placed at location
S06130 + $2F in the video matrix
(memory mapped screen). In
order t o  make t he puddle
blue (colour 6) the corres-
ponding position in the colour
map is loaded with this value.
NORMBIT a n d  RDDRK
simply check to see if a piece of
tarmac o r  a  white line is
required, and place the appro-
priate character on the screen.
NXTBIT decreases t h e
variable RDTYPE2 (the length
of a white line or space) and
tests to see whether a change is
required. CHNGE reverses the
road type, RDTYPE, and resets
the counter RD1YPE2 to 10.
The Other Frog
This is the bit you've all been

the fact that I'm not a graphic
designer and no good at art, I
hope y o u  appreciate t h e
design of the Frenchman. Well,
I thought it wasquite good! But
I digress. Back to the code.

First, we set up the Y co-
ordinates of the four sprites. As
the Frenchman does not mow_
up or down the screen, these
will remain constant, and could
even be set up at thestart of the
program and never altered.
Next we have a short loop
that reads the X co-ordinates
from the table FRENCH and
inserts these into their approp-
riate positions i n  t h e  VI C
Input/Output area.
Last, as far as printing the
sprites goes, we place the sprite
deﬁnitions into the sprite Data
Pointers. Only one of  these
changes (the legs) and the
current value of this is stored in
FRSPRT,
[ PROGRAM: SPRITE DATA
43
Lines 7670 to 7760 concern
the animation of the legs. The
variable FRDEL is  a counter
which decreases from 200 to
zero to create a delay between
movements. When it reaches
zero FRSPRT (the leg sprite
number) is increased. I f  the
value has reached 217, the last
leg sprite, it is reduced to 211,
the ﬁrst leg sprite. This creates a
loop displaying all sprites in
sequence.
The remaining code is con-
cerned with the movement of
the bike. The table BIKEMV
controls the bike movement.
Each entry is three bytes long
and contains t he following
information:
Byte
1
2
3
Meaning
Direction of movement
(255/0/1)
Speed of movement
Duration of movement
(distance moved)
BIKEPOS contains the offset
to the current entry in  the
table. BIKEDEL contains the
delay until the next movement,
and is decreased to see if a new
movement is required. If it is.
BIKEDEL is  restored t o  the
value found in byte two of the
table entry and the Duration of
movement is decreased. If this
has reached zero then a jump is
made t o  NEWDIR. Next the
current direction is found and
FRENCH (discussed earlier) is
either increased, decreased, or
left the same.
This brings us to NEWDIR,
This simply increases BIKEPOS
to point t o  the next entry,
checks to see if the last entry
has been reached (indicated by
$EE in  the table) and i f  so
resetting BIKEPOS t o  zero.
GETDIR simply places the new
speed and duration values in
BIKEDEL and BIKED'S.
To test the code, assemble it
and save both source and
object code. Reset the machine
(making sure you know the
address of START), and do the
following;
LOAD "FROGDAT",8,1
LOAD "FROGDAT2",8,1
LOAD "CODE (or whatever
you have called the object
code)",8,1
SYS (START)
A joystick is  required in
PORT 3.
Next m o n t h  w e  w i l l
introduce the Bird and the Fly!
Can you wait?

BASED ON THE CHARACTERS show, you play the part of
in Russ Abbott's television Basildon Bond as you try to
i
rescue Russ f r o m  a  r iv al
comedy act. To help you in
your quest you can also call on
the sevices of Cooperman and
Blunderwoman.
The game i s  s et i n  a
television studio. In order to
rescue Russ, y ou mus t g o
round t h e  rooms searching
assorted bits of furniture for
jokes and answers which you
must t h e n  l o g  i n t o  y our
computer. Things, however,
are not that simple and there
are various hazards to impede
you. To start with„ you have to
complete your task within a
certain time limit. Wandering
cameras will transport you back
to the start and add 10 minutes
to your clock. Moving faces will
steal your jokes and answers if
they touch you.
To h e lp  y ou, y ou c an
summon Cooperman, w h o
ﬂies across the screen like a
low-level Harrier strike and
takes out any cameras that he
hits.Thegraphics look colourful
but m o v e m e n t  o f  y o u r
character is crude and jerky
and I found that playability was
poor both with control of the
character and lack of addictive
qualities.
This game has pinched a lot
of its ideas from the excellent
Impossible Mission. I f  y ou
compare Impossible Mission to
a James Bond ﬁlm,  t h e n
Basildon Bond is  about as
exciting as Crossroads. G AM.

pool and transported into a
strange w or ld b y  Thelric,
Master of Magic. He wants the
Amulet of Immortality and is
prepared to send you back to
your own world if you get it for
him.
Master of Magic is a menu-
driven role playing adventure
game. Commands c an b e
selected either with a joystick
or v ia the keyboard. Some
options lead into sub-menus
and as soon as you call up the
option list, the game clock
stops so that you can ponder
your actions at leisure.
Selecting "run" allows you
to move around the dungeons.
A map of your current position
is displayed in the top left-hand
corner. T o p  r ight i s  t h e
information box, the centre
window displays the menus
and the bottom of the screen
shows close-up pictures o f
monsters, objects and treasures
that you meet.
Combat can either be with a
weapon that you have found or
with one of four types of spell
at your disposal. Your physical
and mental energies decrease
during combat although they
can be replenished if you ﬁnd
the appropriate potion.
Master of Magic is very easy
to play compared t o  other
games of its type and, although
not over sophisticated, is very
addictive. A t  only  E2.99, i t
represents excellent value for
money.

NO DOUBT ABOUT IT, THIS t io n  leaﬂet that I've seen
game has the longest instruc- s ome time. Not because
for
it's
so complex but because the
instructions take the form of a
cartoon.
Two of the three heroes of
the piece are called Lt. Cdr.
Sock a n d  M a j.  Underpant
which probably explains why
they are covering the nether
regions of space, transporting
food to the planet Niblondis.
The journey is  long and
treacherous so the crew are in
suspended animation in  the
cryofreezer r o o m  -  u n t il
danger strikes! As teroids
pierce the paper-thin shell of
the transporter ship and one by
one the crew members are
revived to face the mundane
task of ship repairs. Fortunately
for the game player this boring
duty i s  livened u p  b y  a n
invasion of Bogloid aliens.
Bogloids just love convert-
ing humans in t o  steaming
pools of grunge and it is each
crew member's duty to turn the
tables o n  t h e  amoeboid
invaders b y  skillful us e o f
power block busters. These
useful weapons can also seal
the outer shell of the ship and
keep the Bogloids at bay on the
outside of the ship while you
ﬂush them away on the inside.
Personally I  g o t  mor e
enjoyment from the cartoon
strip than I did from the game.
If you like pure action buy this
but i f  y ou want a  cerebral
challenge look elsewhere.

BENEATH T H E ATLANTIC
Ocean lies the Titan power
station. This power station is
controlled by ﬁve 'Titans' or
computers: Zeus, Poseidon,
Vulcan, Aries and Hermes.
Each Titan has its own function
and a ﬂeet of mobiles that can
travel around the many roads
in the complex making sure
that everything is  r unning
smoothly.
Of course, things don't run
quite a s  smoothly as  t h e
designers of the power plant
hoped they would and the
Robot Liberation Front have
taken control of four of the ﬁve
Titans and their mobiles. Their
aim is to sabotage the whole
plant so that they can leave a
large portion o f  the world
without power.
Only one Titan still remains
under government control -
Hermes. You are given control
of this computer and all of its
THE SOLAR SYSTEM IS UNDER
attack by Super-Dreadnoughts,
mobiles. You must capture or
destroy all the other Titans
befor e t he  R L F  t a k e s
everything over.
Quake Minus 1 is a rather
strange mix of an arcade game
and a strategy game. Obviously
the aim behind the game is to
regain control of the complex,
but how you achieve it is com-
pletely up to you. For example,
if you destroy any of the other
Titans t h e n  t h e ir  mobiles
become useless and may even
block the travel of your own
mobiles around the system. On
the other hand if you manage
to capture any of the Titans
then a l l  o f  their  mobiles
become yours to control.
You can only control one of
the mobiles at any one time,
this means that you have to
think hard about where you
want to go. All of the mobiles
have different strengths, each
mobile can have up to seven
different weapons although in
practice each one usually has
about four. The best thing to do
is ﬁn d  o u t  exactly w h a t
weapons each mobile has
before you use it. It's not worth
travelling all of the way to an
enemy complex only to ﬁnd
that the mobile doesn't have
the necessary weapon t o
destroy or capture it.
As previously mentioned,
the action takes place on a
series of roads. At the meeting
of roads is placed a junction,
controlled either by the enemy
computers or  you. You may
only pass through a junction
when it is under your control.
As y ou travel along the
roads y ou will come across
numerous other installations.
Some of these will hinder and
some help you. For example if
you stop beside a factory then
you can have repairs made to
the mobile. If you stop next to a
fuel tank then you will be able
to refuel y our  mobile, I f ,
however, you should happen
to run past any rigs or bunkers
that are under enemy control
then you are likely to get blown
to pieces.
It is simple to see what you
control and what the enemy
controls as your roads appear
as yellow through your mobile
window or as red if it is con-
trolled by the enemy.
Controlling your mobiles is
easy but it does take time to get
used to all of the facilities avail-
able to you. Transition mode
allows you to move up and
down the roads. Thrust mode is

gigantic space battleships. The
mission is  t o  intercept and
destroy each o f  the Dread-
noughts which ar e orbiting
around the 15 planets in the
system.
This exhilarating game from
Hewson adds t o  an already
impressive catalogue which
includes Gribbly's Day Out and
Paradroid. T he pseudo 3 D
metallic graphics are similar to
those used in Paradroid but the
action is far more frenzied.
As your Manta ﬁghter glides
over the battleship's surface,
the enemy craft ﬂy in and you
must blast them before they get
you. Their forms are legion and
the higher the class of Dread-
nought, t h e  more furiously
they will ﬁre. Adding to this
problem are the many protruh-
accessed while you are moving
along the road and displays all
of t h e  weapons available.
When you come to a stop you
can rotate your mobile on the
road so that you can take pot
shots at the installations along
the road and there are many
other options too.
Each junction on the road
has a maximum of six roads
leading fr om it. When y ou
enter a junction you automat-
ically enter  junc tion mode
which will allow you to rotate
to all possible roads and view
the lie of the land.
Probably the best thing to
do with this game is give it a go.
It is difﬁcult to play well but
extremely easy to get started
and you can have a great time
zapping anything that moves,
and anything that doesn't1
The graphics in this game
are quite superbly produced.
As y ou travel along the
roads the objects grow in size
and whiz past you.
The game does have one
very a n n o y i n g  f e a t u r e
however, an extremely mono-
tonous tune, if it can be called a
tune. Being fair it does set the
atmosphere for the game but it
does tend to grate after a short
while.
Quake Minus 1 is  not a
game that will suit everybody.
Anyone should be able to get
started quite quickly, but you
should be prepared to spend a
long time getting blown t o
pieces before you master it.

you to land on the surface and
then you can collect fuel rods
by pressing the ﬁre button at
the correct time as a total and a
quit s ign ﬂash alternately,
rather like the gamble feature
on a  fr uit machine. While
doing this you must keep an
eye o n the countdown and
select quit before it reaches
zero.
This super game is for all
those who enjoy quality sound
and action mixed with frenzied
activity.

g
DOCTOR JOSEPH AG O N ,
one o f  the world's greatest
scientists, disappeared over 130
years ago. His relatives quietly
closed the mansion where he
performed his  experiments
and i t  has remained closed
until now. You notice that the
gates are open and wander into
the grounds to have a look
round. The front door of the
house is also open and as you
enter, y ou notice a strange
glow coming from below. You
ﬁnd y our s elf inexplicably
drawn down the steps until you
are in  Dr  Agon's laboratory
where y o u  s ee a  strange
machine and an old diary.
The Eidolon is  the latest
game fr om Lucas Film and
features fractal graphics -
something which you are likely
to hear a lot more of in the
coming year. The Eidolon is the
name of Dr Agon's Orange craft
- a craft which is powered by
the forces of the mind. As you
enter it, you are transported
into a series of  3D tunnels,
populated b y  a s s o r t e d
monsters and strange ﬂoating
spheres.
The spheres are types of
ﬂoating energy and come in
four different types r ed, gold,
green and blue. They have
different functions depending
on whether you are catching or
ﬁring them. Gold and blue
spheres can b e  found lying
around the tunnels and can be
collected. Gold ones increase
your energy supply and blue
ones temporarily suspend the
ﬂow o f  time. You can ﬁre
spheres o f  a n y  c o l o u r
providing you have sufﬁcient
energy simply by selecting the
appropriate key one to four on
the keyboard). Red spheres act
as destructive ﬁreballs, blue
ones freeze creatures for  a
short time and green ﬁreballs
polymorph a  creature into
another which may be more or
less dangerous. If you throw a
red ﬁreball and it  misses its
target, it will rebound towards
you off the wall. You cannot
capture them as such, but if you
hit it with another red ﬁreball it
will transform into a safe gold
sphere whic h c an b e  r e-
captured.
The monsters are many and
varied. Normally inert, they
activate when you approach
and must be destroyed. This is
usually ac c omplis hed b y
blasting them with a few red
ﬁreballs but on lower levels,
you may need to ﬁre a blue one
ﬁrst in order to freeze it, or
transform it with a green one. If
the monster gets too close to
your craft, all your energy is
depleted and you are returned
to the start. When you destroy
one of the creatures, you can
pick up the glowing energy
jewel that it was guarding.
When you reach the end of
the particular level on which
you are travelling, you come
across a large dragon. Normally
inaccessible. You can reach it if
you are carrying the approp-
riately coloured crystal. Then, if
you destroy the dragon, you
are allowed access to the next
level. There are seven levels to
be explored, the last one being
guarded by  a many headed
dragon. No-one knows what
lies beyond. Even D r  Agon
doesn't say in his diary.
Control of  the Eidolon is
very simple - you just push the
joystick in the direction you
want t o  travel. The control
panel on the screen is very easy
to follow. An indicator marked
hot and cold tells you how near
you are to the dragon. Below
that, the gem indicators show
which g e m s  h a v e  b e e n
collected. In the centre of the
screen i s  a  clock showing
fractions of a minute left. This is
surrounded b y  t h e  ﬁreball
indicators -  which ones are
available and which one is
currently selected. Al so
surrounding the clock isa set of
direction indicators. The right
hand gauge shows how much
energy you have left and below
that are two dials showing your
current level and the number
of whole minutes remaining.
The graphics in the game
are stunning. The 3D effects of
the tunnels and the animation
of th e  monsters really i s
excellent. The mathematics of
fractal graphics a r e  q u it e
beyond the comprehension of
this reviewer but if these are
the sort of effects they can
produce, then I'm all in favour!
There is also a jolly little tune to
accompany your craft bobbing
up and down the tunnels. Like
many games now, the cassette
version loads in several parts so
there is a lot of tape rewinding
to be done- another reason for
getting a disk drive.
Although basically a  3 D
maze variant, Eidolon is  an
extremely w e ll presented,
visually attrac tiv e, highly
playable game.
G.R.H.
ULTIMATE'S LATEST OFFERING
is another in the Sir Arthur
Pendragon vein. His quest is to
ﬁnd and destroy the dreaded
Skull of Souls and this is why he
lands up on a God-forsaken
island covered i n  shadowy
vapours and steeped i n  all
manner of deadly vibes. Before
the game even starts, he's been
emotionally traumatised by the
weird emanations from the isle.
However, des pite hav ing
images of death breathed into
his face, the intrepid Sir Art,
persists and so  th e  game
commences.
The g a m e  i s  joy s tic k
controlled a n d  t her e ar e
various helpful items. T he
magic orbs come free at the
start of the game and Sir Arthur
has a great overarm swing for
throwing them. They're quite
us eful f o r  p u l v e r i s i n g
antagonistic brutes and t he
supply seems to be unlimited.
The shovel is fairly easy to get
hold of if you can outwit two
ant-like beings and it can be
used to dig up extra lives. ''l
never laid eyes on the magic
energy cloak but apparently it
makes you virtually invincible.
A lot of the caverns look
very similar and the screen with
the ﬁre-breathing dragon is
incredibly boring because you
need 10 direct hits with magic
orbs before the dragon ﬁnally
dematerialises.
I think you'd need a lot
of patience to get through it
and feeding the budgie would
probably be more entertaining.

Alternate Reality
US Gold M S S  — two disks, joystick' optional
7 k 9
IT WAS A QUIET DAY IN THE
city. Or at least it was until a
spaceship a r r i v e d  a n d
kidnapped y ou. Things get
curiouser and curiouser as you
ﬁnd yourself in a room with
only one exit On the outside is
the City o f  Xebec's Demise.
There seems no alternative but
to go through the door,
Alternate Reality  i s  a n
extremely sophisticated fantasy
role playing game. As soon as
you step through the door, a
set of spinning numbers above
your head stop rotating and
your characteristics in various
ﬁelds are set. The higher they
are, the better chance you have
of surviving t he many and
assorted hazards to be found in
the City . Stamina, charm,
strength, intelligence, wisdom,
skill and hit points all affect the
outcome o f  assorted e n -
counters which you will exper-
ience. YQU are also given a
certain number  o f  c opper
pieces with which to seek your
fortune. Trying to pick a decent
set o f  characteristics before
you step out is nigh on impos-
sible as the numbers are all
scrolling at different speeds.
Personally, I try to get as much
money as possible.
You start off at the Floating
Gate. This is the safest part of
the c i t y  b u t  in c r e d ib ly
expensive. 12,000 odd copper
pieces seems a lot for a sweater
when y o u  only  hav e 209.
Movement is  controlled b y
joystick or keyboard. You can
move forwards and backwards,
turn left and right. There is a
small picture in the centre of
the screen s howing y our
current view. There are many
buildings to enter where the
proprietors are interested in
relieving you of your money.
Shops sell assorted items o f
clothing, mostly way beyond
your current means. A compass
proves to be a wise investment
though. Smithies give you a
chance to haggle over the price
of various weapons. Banks
invite y ou t o  open one o f
several types of account and
will value gems and jewellery
for you. There are inns and
taverns, guilds and healers to
be sought out and used.
One t h in g  that makes
Alternative Reality stand out
from it s  competitors is  its
attention t o  d e t a il.  F o r
example, when you go to an
inn t o spend the night, you
must decide whether you want
to sleep rough on the ﬂoor.
take a room with no bath or
shared bath and s o o n u p
through varying degrees o f
comfort to the best suite in the
house.
It is not long before you
enc ounter  s o m e o n e  o r
something. Who, if anyone, has
surprised whom is determined
and you go into one of two
menus. Engaged is  basically
offensive as you try to attack it.
Disengaged allows you to try
and c har m o r  tr ic k  y our
opponent. Of course, you may
just want to walk away - if you
are allowed to. Your progress is
mo n it o r e d  b y  g a i n i n g
experience points and going
up in skill levels. These are
awarded for killing monsters
and ﬁnding treasure etc.
Combat i s  d e c i d e d
according to a variety f factors:
What weapon is being used -
each one has an attack and
defence value; whether you
attack aggressively, normally or
defens iv ely ; w h a t  y o u r
strength and skill levels are;
how many hit points you have.
When you hit or  are hit, a
number of hit points of damage
are inﬂicted. When your hit
points reach zero, you die. You
may get poisoned or diseased
in combat and have to visit a
healer. You may of course also
ﬁnd some treasure.
Treasure comes in a variety
of forms ranging fr om t he
simple monetar y  thr ough
potions and gems to weapons.
Anything apart from money is
potentially magic or  cursed.
Potions may be beneﬁcial or
poisonous, weapons may have
special properties or be cursed.
A cursed weapon cannot be
dropped b u t  a  guild w ill
remove a curse for a suitable
fee.
The denizens of the city are
many and various. There are
muggers, zombies, hobbits,
wizards, couriers, merchants,
gladiators, noblemen a n d
many, many more including
the bane of my life -  brown
mold i  have never yet survived
an encounter with it). There is
also rumoured to be a Night
Stalker that may or may not
exist.
Time and weather play an
important part in the game.
Rain and darkness attracts the
more unsavoury t y p e  o f
characters. You need to rest
frequently and buy food and
drink. The sun can be seen
rising and setting and you need
to visit inns to ﬁnd out the time
and date, especially if you don't
want to be out after nightfall.
There are several areas of
thegame currently inaccessible
to you. This is because several
expansion kits are planned -
the Dungeon, the Arena, the
Palace, t h e  Wilder nes s ,
Revelation and Destiny. As you
can gather, y our  quest o f
returning t o Earth or  taking
revenge on your captors is not
going to be accomplished in a
single night and so you will
need t o  save y our current
position to a blank disk fairly
frewuently. The game comes
nicely pac k aged w i t h  a
booklet, an instruction leaﬂet
and a partially completed map
of the City.
It took me some time to get
into Alternate Reality. As the
game takes place in real time,
found that I had only just read
the various options when they
disappeared. I also found the
frequent switching o f  disks
frustrating, not through any
fault of the game but because
the C64's disk drive is so slow.
However, slowly but surely,
began to get the feel of things
and the satisfaction of tricking
my ﬁrst merchant, charming a
gladiator a n d  wres tling a
zombie was considerable. The
packaging claims that the game
is t h e  ultimate role-playing
fantasy game. For once, I agree
wholeheartedly.

IT IS THE NINTH AND LAST
innings in the last match of the
World Series (well, you can
dream can't you?) and I  am
losing 4-3.
My ﬁrst m a n  takes a n
almighty swing and the ball
goes soaring into the outﬁeld.
Unfortunately, there is a ﬁelder
underneath it and he is caught
out. The team's star batter is
next man i n  but can only
manage three wild hits at balls
that should have been left
alone a n d  i s  struck o u t .
Everything rests on my last man
in. He leaves the ﬁrst ball alone
but swings at the second -  a
fraction early and the ball goes
straight to an inﬁelder who has
no trouble at all in throwing to
ﬁrst base and running me out
by a mile. Determined to get
revenge, I press the button for
another game, oblivious of the
fact that it is already well past
two in the morning.
Hardball i s  a  s uper b
baseball simulation featuring
some of the best graphics yet
seen on the C64. Baseball is not
particularly well known in this
country but this game should
s timulate c o n s id e r a b le
interes t. A n o t h e r  h u g e
advantage is that it is extremely
playable. You can have a good
game against the computer
without being outclassed. You
can also play against a friend.
For anyone not familiar with
the game of baseball, it is based
on the old British game of
rounders, The batting side tries
to hit the ball and move men
round the four bases on a
diamond. If a batter gets all the
way round, he scores a point
for his side. If he manages to hit
the ball out of the playing area,
this is known as a home run and
everyone o n  t h e  diamond
walks round and scores.
The pitching side tries to
stop the batting side scoring.
Batters can be out in a variety of
ways. He can be caught as in
cricket. He can be run out if the
ﬁelders throw the ball to a base
before the batter runs there.
When a  ball is pitched, the
batter can decide to hit or leave
it alone. If he leaves it and the
ball is going to miss a deﬁned
area, he is OK. This is called a
ball and four balls allow him to
walk to ﬁrst base. If it was going
to hit the target area, it is called
a strike. Three strikes and the
batter is  out. I f  the batter
swings and misses, it is a strike
regardless of whether or not
the ball was on target.
A game consists o f  nine
innings for  each side. Each
innings lasts until three men
are out.
Hardball allows  y ou t o
select your team and make
various s ubs titutions and
changes. Each player has his
name displayed together with
his various playing statistics.
Until you are fairly happy that
you know what you are doing, I
would strongly recommend
that y o u  s tic k  w i t h  t h e
originally selected areas.
When you are happy with
your team, it's on to the game
itself. You decide what type of
ball your pitcher is going to
throw. These are decided for
you according to which pitcher
is playing but you always have a
choice of four which you can
pick with a simple push of the
joystick. The names indicate
various types o f  curve ball.
These may include fastballs,
sinkers, sliders and screwballs.
Another push of the joystick
decides where you are going to
aim the ball. Release the button
and the pitcher winds up and
throws.
If the batter leaves it alone
or misses, a ball or  strike is
called and the details in the
bottom r ight hand o f  t h e
screen are amended. I f  the
batter hits it, the scene switches
to a picture of the outﬁeld. The
ﬁelder nearest the ball ﬂashes
and you must manoeuvre him
accordingly, trying to catch or
ﬁeld the ball. If you pick it up,
maybe with a spectacular dive,
you must then decide which
base to throw to.
This continues until you get
three batters out and then it is
your turn to bat. A press of the
button puts y our man into
batting stance. T he ball is
pitched and you have but a split
second to decide whether or
not to try and hit it. You may
also get other choices such as
whether to try and steal a base
or bunt.
The a n i m a t i o n  a n d
playability o f  Hardball really
are superb. Beg, borrow, steal
or even buy a copy!

Back to the Future
Electric Dreams E9.95
BASED ON THE FILM OF THE
same name, Back to the Future
sees our hero, Marty McFly
going back in time to 1955.
There he meets George and
Lorraine his future parents. The
problem is, Lorraine fancies
Marty and h e  realises that
unless h e can persuade his
parents t o  fall i n  love, the
future will change irrevocably.
To get your parents to fall in
love, they must spend a lot of
time with each other. This you
do by picking up an object in
one of the four locations and
using it to inﬂuence one of the
characters in the game as  well
as your parents, there is Bilf the
bully and Doc Brown. These
objects - love poems, a guitar,
an alien suit and a cup of coffee
- cause the characters to stay
still, follow you or turn away.
You can move round rapidly by
using a  keyboard and can
punch -  and be punched by -
Biff.
Your progress i s  deter-
mined by two photographs. As
your parents stay together, so
your picture builds up and this
in turn results in the family
picture getting completed. Do
badly and the pictures start to
disappear. O n completion, a
quick visit to Doc's house will
take you Back to the Future.
The game's graphics are
quite good, making use o f
icons f o r  o b j e c t s  a n d
characters. T he game itself
lacks substance and lasting
appeal though. Not so much
Back to the Future as back to
the drawing board. G . R . H .

skills of adventuring and

worms his way into some nevil

SEVERAL PEOPLE HAVE WRI TEN IN TO
say they have been given adventures but
do not know what to do with them! This
may seem strange to regular readers of
this column but do you remember how
you got on with the ﬁrst adventure you
ever attempted?
Most of the games available today
have quite good instructions, often
including a list of words which will be
recognised and usually a few general
playing hints as well. Some tell you very
little indeed. For those that are trying
adventures for the ﬁrst time, here are
some bas ic  r ules  f o r  adventuring.
Although these are intended for  text
input games, they apply equally well for
any ty pe o f  adventure game. Just
remember that whether set in dragon
infested dungeons or in a spaceship in the
far future, all adventures are about puzzles
- puzzles which you have to solve!,
Rule number one is: Never get lost.
This can obviously be somewhat o f  a
problem, as adventures have many loca-
tions intended to make you lose your
bearings - like mazes, one way passages or
teleportation rooms. Many 'goodies' are
also hidden i n  these out-of-the-way
places.
Nevertheless, you must be able to
draw a complete map of your travels even
if it means you have to keep coming back
to the same place and trying different
moves.
The standard system is to draw a
number of boxes, as in ﬁgure -
lines signifying the possible routes. Even if
the program tells you the obvious exits
from a location, get into the habit of trying
all directions - programmers are devious
creatures, there may be un-obvious exits!
Mazes are difﬁcult to map. When you
come across several locations that have
the same or very similar descriptions -
watch out! There are a  number o f
variations on a similar theme, but all are
begging the question how do you make
each location unique, so that you can
record its absolute position on your map?
The original system still works in most
cases - this was to drop an item at each
location (ﬁg. 2), so that on returning there
you would get a description that added
the dropped item, so: 'YOU ARE IN A
MAZE OF TWISTY PASSAGES - THERE IS
AN AXE HERE'. With the last phrase
supplying the unique deﬁnition.
As mentioned above, programmers
are devious beggars and have produced a
selection of ploys that are intended to
stop you mapping a maze so easily! One
of my  favourites was when anything
dropped sank into the muddy ﬂoor!
Often you ﬁnd that there is one extra
location above the number of objects you
can carry (or are available). If you think
about it, this also makes the last location

unique t h e  only one without something
there!
Just remember that there must be
some way of solving this puzzle you just
have to ﬁnd it! 'EXAMINE' everything,
perhaps t h e  walls  hav e distinctive
markings or a mirror you are carrying
reﬂects something different at one or

A d v e n t u r e s
more locations! Look carefully at the way
the description is written, perhaps there is
some slight difference -  an additional
comma perhaps?
Rule number t w o  is : Learn t h e
language. Find out which words are
understood and the way in which the
input command has to be written. Some
adventures will accept an input such as:
'GET ALL BUT THE RED BOOK AND RUN
SOUTH AND SIT ON THE ELVEN KING'S
THRONE'. Few experienced adventurers
make use of such complex commands -
certainly in the initial stages of learning
what a game is all about.
It is much more usual to use the simple
verb/noun type of input such as: 'GET
SWORD' or if necessary 'RUN QUIETLY
SOUTH'. But what you must do, is learn
the words that will be understood -  do
you have to use 'EXAMINE', 'SEARCH' or
'LOOK'? Can you 'CLIMB' a bench or do
you have to 'GET ON' it?
This familiarity with the program is
important to get the most out of it -  it
does not take too long to learn a new
games idiosyncrasies but it is still time
well spent.
Does the program support the use of
'HELP' and then give you the odd clue? It
will a l m o s t  c e r t a in ly  r e a c t  t o
'INVENTORY' and tell you what you are
carrying. More importantly, does it allow
you to 'SAVE' your present status and
position, so that you can return in the
future?
How do you repeat the location desc-
ription after  various messages hav e
caused it  to scroll off the top of the
screen? Most will accept 'LOOK' for this
command but some use 'REDEFINE'!
There is  a  growing trend towards a
standard 'Adventure Vocabulary' for all
the normal requirements but watch out
for the non-standard ones amongst them.
Do the commands have to be wriRen
in full (frustrating for slow typists!), or can
words be shortened to the ﬁrst three or
four letters? 'CLIM MO NO ' is  much
simpler to type than 'CLIMB MONOLITH'
and also helps to keep your concentration
on the game rather than on the keyboard.
Rule number three is : Spot t h e
pattern. Good adventures are like good
crossword puzzles -  the answers are
obvious, after you've solved them! Also,
like c r os s wor ds  f r o m  d i f f e r e n t
newspapers, they often seem to have their
own individual patterns.
Do you have to 'EXAMINE' something
twice before you ﬁnd what you really
want? Do you forever have to go forwards
to ﬁnd something you needed to solve an
earlier puzzle? Are only objects made of
wood signiﬁcant -  with those of metal
inhibiting your progress?
Look for patterns or themes. Does this
strange world which you have entered
have its own laws? If so, you must learn
them! A good adventure will have you
sitting on the edge of your seat, sweating
and intent on solving a problem that may
mean life or death. To get the most out of
it you must live the part and that means
understanding its rules.
Finally, although one of the strongest
attractions of an adventure game is the
way in which the adventurer has freedom
of movement and action, you must never
forget the ﬁnal objective. This may be to
rescue the fair princess, save the world,
capture a super-criminal, escape from an
inhospitable planet or just ﬁnd loads of
treasure. But whatever it  is, you will
probably ﬁnd more of a challenge in the
main stream than wandering off on your
own!
Christmas Bonanza
The month or so before Christmas saw a
positive torrent of adventures appearing
in the shops or promised by software
houses. Far too many for us todeal with in
any depth in one month! Some of these
have been extensively advertised and
hopefully will have given you some restful
(?) moments between consuming all that
turkey.
Followers of Level 9 games should
already be deep into the latest in the
Silicon Dream series T he Wor m i n
Paradise. That hard working team from
Adv entur e I n t e r n a t io n a l.  M i k e
Woodroffe and Brian Howarth, have
computerised the Fighting Fantasy book
Seas of Blood by Steve Jackson and Ian
Livingstone. Audiogenic has taken over
the sales and distribution of The Secret of
St Brides and at long last Melbourne
House has released the ﬁrst game in its
Lord of. the Rings series,
Ocean has a probable winner with its
interpretation o f  t h e  ﬁl m  T h e
Neverending Story. Ariolasoft is distri-
buting a  novel, joystick driven, text
adventure game -  Wild West -  where
three in p u t  c ommand options  ar e
displayed at each location. All you have to
do is choose the right one! It may sound as
though this should be an easy game to
play but, when y ou wor k  o u t  t h e
permutations, you'll see that it's not so.
US G old has  launched Lucifer's
Realm w it h  Mis s ion As ter oid and
Masquerade not far behind. In the last of
these you play the part of a Mike Hammer
type private-eye after a rather nasty Crime
Boss -  observation and deduction are
your tools in trade. Use them well.
Duckworth has launched a new text
only adventure - The Odyssey written by
those adventurous brothers Gerrard. At
least this latest epic from their key-worn
ﬁngers includes a 'SAVE' and 'LOAD'
routine, so this time we won't have to
keep our CEAs running night and day to
complete it!
The Worm Turns
Talk amongst adventure players sooner or
later will get round to the games from
Level 9. Early Level 9 games were text only
but i t  was text ﬁlled with sparkling
descriptions which made one wonder
how it ﬁtted into the computer's memory!
As the demand for graphics grew, Level 9
met it with reasonable graphics (lots of
screenfuls of them too) and still with lots
of text to go with them.
For Level 9, things did not stand still,
this software house looked for ways to
improve not only the graphics but also the
basic operating systems. Finally Pete
Austin emerged from his soundproofed,
darkened r oom w it h T he Wor m i n
Paradise.
The Worm is setting a standard that
even Level 9 hopes will last for sometime.
It boasts the facility to recognise a voca-
bulary of over 1000 words. No longer will
you see a word in a description and
experience the computer's refusal t o
recognise its existence when you use it
yourself. You may get the reply that the
word is only part of the scenery but at least
you know where you stand.
As in the last Level 9 offering -  Red
Moon -  the game also features multi-
tasking, so you can be typing in your next
command whilst the pictures of  your
location are being 'drawn' to the screen.
Those same commands can be pretty
complex too. A n  example given is
"EXAMINE ALL BU T  THE HELMET,
DUMMY A N D  LEOTARD A N D  G O
EAST"!
This third. Silicon Dream adventure
(the others were Snowball and Return to
Eden) is a science ﬁction game set in the
far future, 100 years after the events of
Return to Eden_ The scene is set on Eden,
an apparent paradise of a planet. Robots
are commonplace, humans work only 15
hours a week, no taxes are paid and
everything in the garden seems lovely. Or
is it? Surely an ideal place to live and
penalties apparently only for evil-doers.
Yours is  the search t o  ﬁnd out the
underlying truth.
Unlike many  adventures where
movement is highly restricted by a series
of puzzles, here there is plenty to explore
right from the start. Type in 'SCORE'
regularly to see if your actions have made
any difference. O ne presumes that a
higher score means a move along the path
to understanding and deliverance.
Level 9 has always had a name for
marvellous zany humour The Worm is no
exception to this tradition. Tradition or
not, this game cant-cery well be read on
more than one level and I wonder if some
very basic 'Level 9 philosophy' is being
dispensed in a very palatable manner.
Although you may wander around at
will, there are plenty of opportunities for
you to do things. As you might expect,
some of these actions are not beneﬁcial.
The moral here, as always. is to 'SAVE' the
game position fairly regularly.
If you don't receive The Worm in
Paradise for Christmas, I would heartily
recommend you get it as soon as possible

alike.
Swashbuckling For Everyone
The proliﬁc team at Adventure Inter-
national must share the ratings with Level
9 f o r  producing this  country's t o p
adventures. Unlike Level 9, whose games
are nearly all original ideas, Al tends to
specialise in  taking existing books or
characters (Spiderman,Gremlins etc.) and
working magic to produce a version that is
truly original,
Seas o f  Blood is  based upon the
Penguin Fighting Fantasy book of the
same name. This is  a  multi-option
adventure that has proved, together with
others by the same authors, that this form
of role-playing adventure book can and
does, capture the imagination o f  the
youngsters w h o  b u y  them i n  their
thousands. We now have to wait and see if
the computer version can achieve the
same popularity.
The story-line is fairly simple; you are
the captain of the pirate vessel Banshee,
to complete the game you must ﬁnd and
retrieve some 20 treasures and take them
to the top of a mountain at the southern
end of the Inland sea. Quite why you must
do this is not clear but then no-one
without imagination plays adventure
games.
Not having 'played' the book I cannot
compare the two products, all I can say is
that the computer version is on a par with
other Al recent releases. I t  has good
colourful graphics and a similar operating
system to the other games.
Input commands are given in the form
v er b/noun a n d  t h e  v oc abular y
understood is not extensive, in fact this
facet of Al's programs is quite unsophisti-
cated. Most of the time, if a word is not
recognised, i t  i s  ignored! Strangely
enough, although this can sometimes be
slightly misleading.. it does encourage a
simple direct approach which is perhaps
one of its attractions.
Note that the game is the ﬁrst of the
Fighting Fantasy titles w it h the accent on
ﬁghting! Whenever you attack or  are
attacked, the screen displays a pair of
spinning dice and a series of  throws
determines the outcome of the battle.
Random factors such as these can ruin an
otherwise good adventure game but this
system works quite well.
Until you have found what has to be
fought, the ﬁghting aspect can make the
game fairly short! Persevere and things
become clearer. Some risks can b e
balanced out by judicious SAVEing of the
game.
The game starts with you aboard the
Banshee. To move you must type in 'SAIL
SOUTH' etc., a bit long winded hut that's
the system. There are over 400 apparent
locations but, as a very large number of
these are the same view of the sea from
the ship, don't get too excited! I also
Tape Of The Film
suspect that after a certain southern point
a series o f  seascapes is repeated ad-
inﬁniturn.
This s ea v iew c an pos e certain
problems -  lik e mapping. I t  is  very
important to know where you have been,
or more to the point, where you have not
been! You must also learn where you can
ﬁnd provisions, for without them your
crew will mutiny and the game will end.
Each sailing move costs you one unit of
these provisions and this can indirectly
help you with mapping -  check your
number of sailed moves by noting the
provisions left,
On a couple of occasions I ended up
stranded on the shore, unable to 'BOARD
BANSHEE' or 'GO BANSHEE'. Whether
this is a bug or merely a game puzzle, time
will tell. Note the use of 'GO XXXX'. Al
often uses this syntax, so if you ﬁnd you
cannot get to what is obviously an inter-
esting location. try 'GO ENTRANCE', 'GO
PASSAGE', 'GO HOLE' etc.
All the sea scenes pose an interesting
problem in accurate mapping. Seas of
Blood has  a  c er tain nov elty  a n d
encourages you to continue if only to
check your own stamina! The puzzles are
interesting without being particularly
brain-bending a n d  f o llo w e r s  o f
Adventure International should enjoy this
one.
Ocean Software seems to have discovered
a winning formula for an adventure game
at the ﬁrst try and it's nice to see some
original thinking producing an interesting
new approach. The Neverending Story
comes as four parts on two cassettes, each
loading pretty quickly in about two and a
half minutes.
The game follows the general story-
line of the ﬁlm, with the powers of evil
relentlessly attacking the land of Fantasia.
This 'All-consuming Nothing' can only be
halted and reversed by someone outside
the reality of Fantasia.
Somewhere on our world is a little boy
who ﬁnds a book telling the story of
Fantasia. He begins to believe, and enters
and travels about this other world in the
form of a local lad called Atreyu.
The graphics are colourful and novel.
One main scene is displayed across the
top of the screen, this is then overlayed
with a small picture showing either who is
present or where you are. A further six
small pictures show what you have with
you and could be a little difﬁcult to
decipher.
The command interpreter is simple-
minded, with only a very small voca-
bulary, requiring only the simplest verb/
noun input. This is the weakest part of the
game. You have to 'GET FALKOR' (the
ﬂying Luckdragon) before you can 'FLY
WEST' etc. and having ﬁnished with his
services y ou t h e n  hav e t o  'DROP
FALKOR'! Neither does it recognise the
'adventures friend' 'EXAMINE'.
The game could make a good primer
for the novice adventurer since there are
plenty of places to explore right from the
start. The puzzles set are not terribly
difﬁcult but will often require a little
thought! But there is one snag- no 'SAVE'
and 'RESTORE' facility.
The ﬁrst part has about 40 locations
and although you die if you stay too long
in the swamps there is a fairly logical
selection of 'goodies' to be found and
used. Most things have a purpose even if
they are not necessary to complete the
game.
Mapping this part is not difﬁcult and
will save a lot of wandering around, so do
ill Generally the text will give you the
right hints at the right time. If in doubt
remember that 'ﬁre destroys'.
Once you have loaded the second part
- get ready for the frustrating bit. There
are over 25 death traps within six moves of
the start! If you take a wrong step you
have to re-load part one! This is where the
lack of a 'SAVE' game position becomes
something of a classic error in program-
ming. Other computer versions of the
game have a 'SAVE'!
I do not think it will spoil the fun if I
advise you not to travel west or south of
where you start. Neither should you travel
more than two moves to the east until you
have moved north twice. You can still die
by going too far north but read the text
and take care. There are still nine lethal
moves!
Your wonderful dragon steed dis-
appears at the start o f  part two but
reappears in the nick of time when you
have discovered what you need to know.
So persevere.
Part three has no lethal traps and is
fairly easy providing you don't panic
when faced with a maze. These come in
three varieties -  wood, stone and glass!
Finally you will meet the Empress and
realise that you have given Fantasia the
chance of a future after all.
There are other characters who appear
from time to time but they do not have
any independent part to play in the action
and merely add atmosphere.
Make a note of the things you ﬁnd and
try and ﬁnd a use for them. Never be
without the good-luck charm, Auryn, for
longer than necessity dictates! Even with
its faults, an enjoyable adventure.

YOU COLLD PROBABLY COUNT ON
the ﬁngers of one hand the computer
programs that would appeal t o  your
granny. Well, you can now add one more
to t h e  lis t ,  Roc k 'n'Wres tle f r o m
Melbourne House. Load up this and it's
just like any Saturday afternoon spent
watching Bad Barney taking on Gorgeous
Greg in the wrestling ring.
Not only is this a great game to play but
it is great fun to sit back and watch. Play is
probably a slightly tame word to describe
the complete battering that y ou are
bound t o  suffer as soon as you take
control of your joystick. My advice is not
to bother playing the game at all but
rather sit back and be entertained.
The program has an excellent demo
mode. You can sit back in the comfort of
your own armchair and watch each of the
10 characters challenge each other in the
ring. You can hear them scream as they
are dropped on their heads. Watch the
ring bounce as their opponent lands on
top of them and hear the ref count them
out,
The action can only be described as
superb, obviously the graphics do lack a
little realism but they aren't as bad as you
might expect, the wrestlers perform all of
the well-known moves, full nelson, back
breaker, atomic drop and many more. It's
quite good fun t o watch one of the
wrestlers being swung around in circles
and then let go into one of the ropes,
1
which g,o,e way very realistically as he hits
them. Meanwhile the other player is
getting ready to knock him to the ﬂoor as
he bounces off, all accompanied by the
necessary grunts and wheezes that you
would expect in a real wrestling game.
No doubt there are a few wrestling and
games fanatics who can't wait to get in the
ring, personally I feel safer just watching.
If you really must get into the ring and
have a chance to look at the colour of the
canvas then there are both one and two
player options, t he characters being
controlled by either joystick or keyboard.
The two player game is an excellent way to
solve family arguments.
Controlling your players is extremely
difﬁcult as  there are more than 35
different manoeuvres that you can make
with the joystick. To make things even
worse the direction that you must push
the joystick in order to perform a speciﬁc
function depends on which direction the
character is facing it gets very confusing.
A typical move would be to approach
the opponent from the front, push the
joystick in the direction that the character
is lacing and then towards his back, this
will grab your opponent. Next you should
keep the joystick held back so that you
can lift your opponent into the air. Now
you can aeroplane spin him by jiggling
your joystick left and right. Then by
pulling the joystick back you can drop
him unceremoniously with a pile driver.
At least, that's what's supposed t o
happen, in my case it was usually my
player that ended up being dropped on
his head only to be crushed by the other
player and counted out by the ref.
Control sounds complicated, and it is.
Don't worry though, if you are willing to
spend a couple of house playing around
you'll soon grasp the controls and then
you can start to get your own back on your
opponents.
There are 10 combatants including
yourself. Each character is extremely well
displayed and has varying characteristics.
Lord Toff is  t he most dangerous
character of all, he plays very carefully and
knows all the moves. Masked Bad Barney
really likes to hurt his opponents, Flying
Eagle is extremely agile, how he manages
to keep his headress on I don't know.
Next comes Vicious Vivian the local
purple haired punk, and on they go,
The ﬁrst charact er you'll ﬁnd yourself
taking on as Gorgeous Greg is Redneck
McCoy. Take it from me, he really likes to
drop you to the ﬂoor with an atomic drop,
you don't get up very often from one of
these, Perhaps I'm just chicken but I did
ﬁnd it easier to run and kick him every so
often rather than trying to take him on, I
usually ended up the worse for it if I did.
Rock 'n'Wrestle is certainly one of the
best games that I have come across. Not
only is it great fun to play but you could
keep the whole family entertained by
simply letting them watch it, that's very
unusual for a game.
If you own a C64 then you really must
add this to your collection, you won't
regret it.
Get yourself into a half nelson with
Rock'n'Wrestle from Melbourne House.

All of the necessary changes
were made but it still does not

You will ﬁnd here a few
changes which need t o  b e

ALL THE PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES
covered in this series so far have one
thing in common; they are designed to be
used for a speciﬁc types of task: that is, the
language is best suited when used to solve
a particular type of problem. One such
example is COBOL (COmmon Business
Orientated Language). COBOL is used for
data proc es s ing i n  t h e  business
environment. Another  ex ample i s
FORTRAN (FORmula TRANSIation),
which is used by the scientiﬁc community
for number-crunching tasks.
These and other languages rely on the
programmer being aware of what data he
is going to work on, and in what formal
the data is. This can take up a lot of the
programmer's time, which in a sense is
wasted, because the programmer should
be dealing with the task at hand - solving
the problem!
The users are no better off either.
There a r e  v ery  f e w  programming
languages which allow the user to ask
'what if?' ty pe o f  questions -  thus
restricting them. However all is not lost -
there is PROLOG.
PROLOG (PROgramming in LOGic) is
fast becoming one of the most popular
programming languages. Those of you
who are aware of Artiﬁcial intelligence
(Al) will n o  doubt have heard about
PROLOG, as it is a very popular language
in this ﬁeld. So much so that the Japanese
have decided to adopt PROLOG as the
primary language in their ﬁfth generation
computer project.
But what makes PROLOG program-
ming different from programming with
'conventional languages?
Imperative And Declarative
Programming as we know it requires the
programmer to tell the computer exactly
what to do by means of a set of instruc-
tions. The computer acts upon these
instructions 'blindly' and does not deviate
from them. This is also applicable to so-
called decisions making features such as
the IF construct - you are still telling the
computer what t o  d o .  This is  t h e
imperative style of programming.
It is very strict and not very ﬂexible. It
would be far better if it were possible to
describe the problem in general terms by
describing the problem in an English type
manner. That is what we do every day
when w e  describe a  problem. Now,
providing the description of the problem
contains all the data necessary to solve the
problem, it should (in theory) be possible
for a computer to ﬁnd the answer!
To actually d o  this, the computer
would need instructions telling it how to
use the information that it is given. This is
the declarative style of programming,
Describing the problem should not
too different from describing a problem
in real life e.g:
The pain is on the right side of my chest
and
My head spins if I climb the stairs
A declarative type of program requires a
description which takes the form of a set
58
The problem is:
What should Henry avoid?

of facts and rules, and the problem above
includes these.
FACT: The pain is on the right side of my
chest
RULE: My head spins if I climb the stairs
Here are some facts and rules from a
declarative program
1 Asthma sufferers should avoid smoky
atmospheres.
2 The atmosphere in Piccadilly Circus is
smoky.
3 Henry is an asthma sufferer.
The program should answer: Piccadilly
Circus.
Now, it cannot be said that PROLOG
can be used to solve problems in such a
free-hand style as described above, but it
can be used in a similar manner.

L a n g u a g e s
The Language
A PROLOG program consists of a set of
rules and facts which make up a program
description - a program or database. Both
facts and rules are referred to as sentences
which must be written in a precise form
known as a sentence form. Any questions
put to the program are called queries.
PROLOG itself (the core language) is a
little hard t o  understand and learn.
Because o f  this, Logic Programming
Associates (LPA) have included a user-
friendly 'fr ont- end' w hic h mak es
PROLOG easier to use for beginners. All
the examples ar e i n  SIMPLE. T he
following examples are extracts from the
thoroughly excellent PROLOG tutorial,
supplied with the package -  Problem
Solving with PROLOG.
Imagine a party. We wish to make
various observations about what is going
on. Bill is sitting gazing at Jean, and it's
obvious that he likes her. Describing this
fact as a  PROLOG sentence is  fairly
straight forward
likes (Bill Jean)
Gossip is rife, and we discover that various
people like each other.
likes (Diane Colin)
likes (Janet Ian)
The structure for PROLOG facts is as
follows. First there is the predicate 'likes'
which is followed by a bracketed list of
terms c alled arguments. Predicates
roughly correspond to verbs in English,
and arguments to nouns. Notice that like
English, even though Diane likes Colin, it
does not mean that Colin likes Diane!
We would also observe that
enjoys (Diane rock)
enjoys (Jean reggae)
In this example the predicate is 'enjoys'
and the two arguments are the name of
the individual followed by the type of
music.
A list of arguments is not restricted to
two. Sam is acting barman, and is serving
drinks to the guests:
gives (Sam Diane gin-and-tonic)
gives (Sam Colin cola)
Two things are worth observing. First,
the hyphens are used to ensure that 'gin
and tonic' is treated as one argument. If
spaces were used each word would be
treated as a separate argument. It is also
important t o  be consistant about the
number of arguments and their positions.
For example:
gives (Sam Colin cola)
gives (Sam Gin david)

partners (Janet Ian) if
enjoys (Ian heavy-metal) &
likes (Ian Bill)
partners (Diane Sam) if
gives (Sam Diane gin-and-tonic) &
not smokes (Sam)
PROLOG will not alert you to the fact
that Sam gave the Gin a David!
Meanwhile back at the party, Janet has
informed us that she becomes ill if she
smokes. This is a rule. A PROLOG rule has
two parts; the consequence and the
condition
ill (Janet) if smokes (Janet)
The consequence 'Janet is ill' is true if the
condition 'Janet smokes' is fulﬁlled. Each
rule takes the form of an atom which
describes the consequence part. This is
59
followed by 'if' and atoms which make up
the condition, If there is more then one
condition 'and' and '&' are used to join
them.
To demonstrate this, consider the
situation where Diane will partner Sam if
he gives her a gin and tonic and does not
smoke. This would be written down as:
partners (Diane Sam) if
gives (Sam Diane gin-and-tonic) &
not smokes (Sam)
Asking Questions
With all these sentences of information
(table 1) in the micro, it's about time we
started asking some questions -  o r
interrogated the database. Remember,
even though the example is small, 'real-
life' PROLOG programs could contain
thousands of facts and rules.
A query can take the form of IS. To ﬁnd
out whether Janet likes Ian we would
enter
is (likes (Janet Ian))
YES will be displayed. IS simply ﬁnds out
whether a relationship is true or false.
Another example is:
is (smokes (Bill))
NO will be displayed.
Now for the biggie! Does Jean partner
Bill?
is (partners (lean Bill))
YES is the answer! This time PROLOG had
to do a little more work. PROLOG had to
ﬁnd out whether Bill likes heavy-metal.
Life is not so simple, and YES and NO
are not very informative answers. We may
wish to have the names of people as
answers, and to do this WHICH queries
are used. To ﬁnd out who smokes at the
party the following WHICH query can be
entered
which (x : smokes (x))
Diane
Ian
No (more) answers
would be displayed. PROLOG is asking
which term could replace x in the goal
'smokes(x)' in order to make the goal
succeed.
The 'x ' in the WHICH query is a
variable, and they can be put to greater
use because a variable can represent an
unspeciﬁed term. For example, it is a
known fact that someone is unhealthy if
they smoke. To write such a rule in
PROLOG the variable x would replace the
'someone'. The consequence part is:
unhealthy (x)
and the condition is
smokes (x)

an
So 'unhealthy' (x) if smokes (x)
added to the database. To actually ﬁnd
out who is unhealthy the WHICH query
would be used in the form;
which (x: unhealthy (x))
PROLOG will display
Diane
Ian
No (more) answers
Summary
This article has just touched on the capa-
bilities of the PROLOG language- there is
much, much more!
The language is by no means simple to
learn. The main reason for this is that the
programmer has to adapt to declarative
programming. I s  i t  wor th learning
though? Well, PROLOG is already being
used b y  many  academic established
dealing with Al. The ﬁfth-generation of
computers is being designed to be more
friendly to use, and requires a language
that will enable facts to be extracted with
the minimum of fuss. PROLOG is one
such language (LISP is another), and as
stated already, the Japanese have decided
to make it the ofﬁcial ﬁfth-generation
language for their new breed of super-
computers.
6502 Micro-PROLOG
The Micro-PROLOG package consists of
the system disk, reference manual and
PROLOG tutorial guide. Although the
package is a tutorial (the PROLOG is an
interpreter only), there is a lot to it, with
plenty of utilities and a lot to learn. LPA's
Micro-PROLOG is an interpreted version
of the language for interactive use on
micros, and as such you cannot expect to
write very large programs.
The heart of the package is a small
built-in supervisor program whic h
accepts programs
written in a standard syntax. The super-
visor can be tailored or  extended by
loading in programs (modules) written in
PROLOG which can alter and extend the
supervisor - a very powerful feature!
Besides the PROLOG interpreter itself,
a number of these modules are supplied
on the distribution disk, They include two
program development systems; SIMPLE is
one s uc h system w hic h gives t h e
newcomer to PROLOG a user-friendly
front end to the supervisor and is used
throughout the tutorial manual. MITSI
offers most of the features of SIMPLE, but
provides an 'educational' type of front
end with meaningful variable names and
such like. Both these and any other
executive extension take up RAM and are
only intended to be used when learning
the language.
Other programs on the disk include
three trace programs (one for SIMPLE),an
editor, a couple of error handlers and a
package t o  facilitate t h e  design o f
modules.
The biggest let-down with the package
is the Reference Manual. It is written for
use with other 6502 systems (BBC, Apple
etc.), and is by far the worst manual I have
ever read! The tutorial manual by Tom
Conlon is excellent but written for those
who are using SIMPLE.
Progressing f r om SIMPLE t o  t h e
standard PROLOG syntax will be hard
because of the badly written Reference
Manual. Because o f  this  I  w o u ld
recommend that anyone considering
buying the package also considers buying
a few books on PROLOG as well.
A couple of extensions (or primitives)
for the C64 include 10 for PEEKing and
POKEing, POPEN for  low-level stream
opening and CAT for a disk catalogue.
Graphics and sound are not supported
with any extra primitives, but using 10 it
should be possible to use these features.
loading micro-PROLOG takes under a
minute and SIMPLE takes about a minute.
33844 bytes are free. l r A  is taken up by
the dictionary and the rest is 'shared' by
the heap and stack and user programs_
Even though the user-manual is a let-
down the Micro-PROLOG package is very
comprehensive a n d  w e l l  w o r t h
considering.

Commodore launches a
program that is designed to
please the bank manager.
ARE YOU THE TYPE OF PERSON WHO
dreads seeing a  bank  statement fall
through your letter box? Do you never
have enough money to pay your bilk?
Well, you n o longer have an excuse.
Commodor e's  Pe r s o n a l M o n e y
Management (PMM) program, for the
CEet, Plus/4 and C128 will come to your
rescue.
Personal Money  Management i s
designed t o  help you r un two bank
accounts. O ne o f  them should b e a
cheque account which should contain all
money required for  paying bills and
general spending. The other is a deposit
account which should contain any 'spare'
cash that you have at any time.
Essentially P M M  i s  a  budgeting
program. It requires you to decide exactly
how much you spend on particular items
each month. For example. if your gas bill is
usually around E60 per quarter you know
that you should budget for 20 per month.
Provision is made for 10 different budgets
and you can change these to suit your
requirements. A couple of examples are
given, one of a fairly well off family and
the other of a poorly paid journalist. I
must admit I do resent the journalists
uudget being for booze and betting,
we're not all like that (honestl1). Each
budget has a limit of E8000 per month
(wishful- thinking — Ed) though I'm sure
that very few people will ever reach this
limit.
Selecting t he last budget account
displays an extra menu. This allows you to
enter all of your standing orders. The
manual does recommend that you only
put standing orders t•,at ar e paid
occasionally i n  this  section and any
monthly ones should be stored as one of
•ne 10 budgets e.g. mortgage. This is
because for each budget account you can
view the last 14 payments that have been
made. Since all of the standing orders are
stored under one budget entry it is only
possible to view the last 14 paid. When I
tried to enter my own budgets for the
month I found I soon ran out of entries.
The only way to enter everything needed
was to store items like monthly standing
orders under one budget heading and
enter a total cost as the payment. This
causes no real problem but does mean that
the program will only display the total of
your payments rather than each payment
made under this account heading.
Whenever you receive a  bill, e.g.
electricity, then these ar e entered.
Obviously y ou need n o t  enter any
standing orders as these will already have
been taken care of by the program. Again
Once a Month
M O N E Y
M A N A G E M E N T
61
the program will only display records of
the last 14 bills paid so if you want a check
over the whole year it is better to calculate
all bills for one month and input the total.
Again not very friendly but it works.
One of the biggest problems that I
found with the program is that you can't
put y o u r  monthly  salary in t o  t h e
computer. You have to enter what the
computer calls 'extra income'. This is
simply t he difference between y our
budget account total and your actual
income. For example if  your budgets
came t o  E250 per  month and y our
earnings were E600 then you would have
'extra earnings' of £350. I thought that a
computer was supposed to make things
like this easier, surely it would have been
possible for  y ou t o  enter the actual
income and let the computer work out
the rest. Oh, I nearly forgot to mention
that the program assumes that the 'extra
income' will be going into the deposit
account.
Once every month you must carry out the
'current month calculation' this is the
time when the computer will tell you just
how much you have or have not got. The
computer gives the following information.
The amount needed this month to pay
all of your bills and standing orders. If you
have spent less than your budgets then
you are told to transfer the excess to your
deposit account. This way you can get
interest on the extra money.
If expenses are more than are in the
cheque account you are informed just
how much you need to transfer from the
deposit account to your cheque account
Last but by no means least isa list of the
bills that you have said need to be paid,
just in case you had forgotten.
Look at the Year
You can see at a glance just how well your
accounts are doing at any time, You can
check you current balances are working
out, i.e. if you have spent more on a
certain item than you had budgeted for.
You can get a list of your expenses for the
last 12 months and a record of the most
recent transactions.
Verdict
If, like me, your one aim in life is to keep
your bank manager happy and for some
reason or other you never seem able to do
so, then this is probably the program you
have been waiting for. If you can set
yourself up with reasonable budgets and
stick to them then I can see no reason at all
why t h e  computer and y our  bank
accounts shouldn't work together t o
make you a little better off.
As mentioned there are a couple of
niggles o r  r ough edges about this
program, such as no wages entry, but
these are soon overcome.
My advice is to keep you and your
bank manager happy, go and buy a copy
of PMM, it will no doubt pay for itself.

IF YOU'VE EVER NEEDED TO
store a lot of information, be it
addresses or lists of books, then
you probably used a good., old-
fashioned card index box. This
is great until you wish to look
for some particular informa-
tion, For example let's suppose
that your card index box con-
tains a  lis t o f  names and
addresses which have been
ﬁled by name. If you wanted a
list of all the people who lived
in London it could take you
hours to look at each card to
get the information you need.
This is where Data Bos conies to
the rescue.

THE C-16 AND PLUS/4 COM-
puters, like the C64 and Vic 20
before them, have the capa-
bility o f  displaying a  user
deﬁned character set.
The great value o f  user
deﬁned characters lies in the
ease with which they can be
used to create quite complex
graphics displays. This feature
is particular important in games
programming. Mos t graphics
games displays inv olv e a
considerable d e g r e e  o f
repetition of a small range of
patterns or shapes. There is also
a c ommon requirement i n
games programs t o  rapidly
change or move areas of the
display.
Normally, this  would b e
carried out on a C64 using
sprites., but the C-16 and Plus/4
do not have hardware sprite
capability. Thus programmable
characters a r e  t h e  b e s t
alternative way o f  achieving
sprite-like displays.
Besides games, user deﬁned
characters are useful in  any
application which requires a
special character set. Such
applications inc lude foreign
languages a n d  sprites, o r
scientiﬁc notation.
The problem with using the
user deﬁned character set on
the C-16 and Plus/4, is that it
requires access to the graphics
control chip -  TED. The TED
chip is  complex and unfor-
tunately Commodor e has
published very little informa-
tion on this device. It took a
considerable amount o f  trial
and error investigation to ﬁnd
the r i g h t  loc at ions  a n d
determine how they function
(a c omplete lis t  o f  T ED
locations and their functions
will be given next month).
Having discovered t h e
correct TED locations to create
user deﬁned characters, a n
editor program is required to
simplify c r eation o f  t h e
characters. T h e  character
editor included here is very
versatile and comprehensive
and can handle all the display
modes of the machines.
67
It is very easy to use, and its
commands ar e s elf doc u-
mented. Each character is
created using a magniﬁed plot
of the character. A normal size
character i s  als o s hown,
essential for getting the colour
right i n  multi-colour mode.
Once created the user deﬁned
characters can be saved to tape
or disk for later and merging
into a program.

Eric Corbett brings
you his Basic Test 
I
System, to make
[writing in Basic a littiel
less of a headache.
THERE ARE VERY FEW EFFECT-
ive program development aids
available f o r  us e o n  home
micros. This program provides,
what I think, is one of the most
useful -  an interactive testing
system.
This Basic Interactive Test
System (BTS) creates a  test
harness w hic h allows  t h e
efﬁcient debugging o f  Basic
programs running under its
control. Functions available
inc lude s ingle- s tepping,
setting of break points and line
tracing.
It's a machine code routine
which should prove invaluable
when writing Basic programs
on your C64.
Using the System
Load a n d  r u n  BTS before
beginning Basic programming.
After a  short delay, during
which BTS will be locating itself
from 49152 t o  50432, t h e
message
READY
will appear on the screen. Type
in NEW and the machine may
now be used as normal.
The program lis ting as
provided incorporates a check
sum at the end of each 128
bytes of data. If a typing error
has been made, then a check
sum discrepancy will be re-
ported for the block of data in
question. T h is  m u s t  b e
corrected before BTS can be
used.
Commands Available
To enter into a dialogue with
BTS, press function key 1. The
message
BTS READY
will appear on the screen. The
prompt character ( - ) indicates
that the machine is now in the
BTS command mode. To leave
this mode and return to the
Basic immediate mode, type
END.
In the command mode, the
following c ommands  a r e
available: FAST, SLOW,TRACE,
STEP. BREAK
BREAK
This allows a break-point to be
set at any line in the program.
This is equivalent to inserting a
Basic STOP verb at the start of
the break-pointed line, but is
much more powerful because
the source program is  not
actually altered.
For example:
>BREAK 150
w o u ld  c a u s e  p r o g r a m
execution to be halted when
line 150 was about t o  b e
obeyed.
Having thus  halted t h e
program at the desired line,
values o f  variables may  b e
checked or altered as usual at a
break-point.
The program may be con-
tinued normally from this point
(by use o f  the Basic CONT
verb). However, t w o  extra
functions are available through
BTS. Pressing function key two
will cause the break-pointed
line to be listed to the screen.
Pressing function key seven
will continue execution of the
Basic program.
Typing in
>BREAK 0
will clear the break-point.
STEP
This command causes the Basic
program to be executed in a
single-step mode, i.e. a break-
point is set for every line in the
program.
Thus at each new line about
to be obeyed, BIS will force a
return to the Basic immediate
mode. From here execution
may be continued as described
under the BREAK command.
This a l l o w s  v e r y  c lo s e
monitoring of the ﬂow through
a program.
For example:
STEP ON
would enable the single-step
mode.
--STEP OFF
would disable the single-step
mode.
TRACE
When the TRACE mode is set.
BIS displays on the screen the
line number of each line in the
program as it is obeyed in the
form [150), for example. This is
equivalent to the TRON/TROFE
commands on the C128.
For example:
TRACE ON
would enable the line trace
mode.
would disable the line trace
mode.
-TRACE OFF
SLOW
This command slows down the
speed of  execution o f  Basic
programs by a factor of approx-
imately ﬁv e. This  c an b e
particularly us eful -  f o r
instance when using the line
tracing mode -as otherwise it is
very difﬁcult to follow what is
happening w h e n  t h e  lin e
numbers ar e c hanging a t
normal speed.
FAST
70 [
This command returns t h e
execution s peed o f  Basic
programs to normal.

D Chiles provides an
extremely fancy
I
monitor.
ONE OF THE MOST USEFUL
programming tools  that is
available to the machine code
programmer is a monitor and
many ar e available o n  t he
market. Topmon, however, is
probably o n e  o f  t h e  most
powerful monitors y ou w ill
come across, offering the user
over 20 commands including
disassembly and the ability to
enter text into memory.
Exactly why is a machine
code monitor so useful? As you
probably  a lr e a d y  k n o w ,
machine code programs are
stored in memory as a series of
numbers. These numbers can
be seen from Basic by using the
PEEK instruction. If you want to
see an example of this then
enter the following program:
10 FOR C=40960 TO 40970
20 PRINT PEEK C)
30 NEXT C
All this program does is to print
out the ﬁrst 10 numbers of the
Basic ROM. In case you didn't
know, Basic is a machine code
program that runs automatic-
ally w h e n  y o u  t u r n  y our
computer on. When you enter
any c ommands  i t  i s  t h is
machine code program that
works out exactly what it is you
want to do and then performs
the action. This program is
stored i n  m e m o r y  f r o m
location 40960 to 49151.
Obviously PEEKing a series
of locations every time you
want to look at them would be
a fairly long winded process.
Altering a series of memory
locations w i t h  t h e  PO KE
function would take even more
time. This is where the machine
code monitor comes to the
rescue.
With topmon the command
'M' allows you to display and
change (Modify) a  series of
locations, The format of the
command is:
M ssss eeee
where ssss and eeee are the
start and end locations which
4A,
TOPMON
you wish to look at. However
one s mall p o in t  mus t b e
remembered, most machine
code monitor s , inc luding
Topmon, require that any
numbers b e  e n t e r e d  i n

hexadecimal format (i.e. Base
16). Using hexadecimal makes
life very easy for the machine
code programmer as the later
example will show.
Any memory location can
only hold a number up to 255.
Therefore, if we want to store a
number that is greater than 255
we need to use two memory
locations and store the high
part o f  the number in one
location and the low byte in the
second. If we wanted to break
down a decimal number into its
two parts we would have to use
the following formula:
Low n u m b e r  = n u m b e r -
INT(number/256)"256
High number=INT(number/
256)
To make things even more
awkward the number is stored
with the low part in the lower
memory location and the high
part in the following location.
For example, the number 49152
will break down into 192 and
zero. Use the above formula if
you want to work this out for
yourself.
If you then want to ﬁnd out
what number two addresses
contain in decimal you would
have t o  use t h e  following
formula. Complicated isn't it?
n u m b e r -
(high)
Now let's take a look at
hexadecimal. If we wanted to
break a hexadecimal number
down in to two parts there are
no complicated formulae. All
we need t o  d o  is split the
number i n  half —  e.g. the
hexadecimal number  F36A
breaks down into:

where ssss is the address where

why you are able to edit each

Before w e  examine t h e
parameters we will take a look
at what relocation is . T he
following two line example is
one that would (or should)
never appear but illustrates our
relocate command very yvell.
Location Instruction
C000 LDA #00 ; load accumu-
lator with 0
C.002 .IMP C000; jump back to
C000
Now, i f  w e  mov e this
program t o  s o m e  o t h e r
location in memory, say 8000
hex, w e  w ould hav e t h e
following:
8000 I D A  000
8002 I M P  C000
As you can see the loop no
longer exists and the program
would still jump to C000.
The relocate command will
alter any program so that any
absolute instructions i n  the
memory range aaaa to bbbb,
which refer to any addresses
between cccc and dddd, will
change any absolute instruc-
tions so that they have an offset
to eeee. So, to relocate the
above example, w e  would
enter the command:
R C000 C004 C000 C004 8000
The program would then be
stored in memory in such a way
that it would run to 8000. You
will have to move the program
yourself with the 8 command
to be described later.
Block Move — B
As mentioned abov e i t  is
possible to move a block of F  A000 BFFF "PRINT"
memory from one location to
another. The format for this would search through the Basic
command is: 
R
O
M
 for every occurence of
the word "PRINT".
B ssss eeee nnnn
where ssss and eeee are the
start and end o f  the block
which you want to move and
nnnn is the new address to
which you want to move it. For
example:
B A000 BFFF 8000
would move all the memory
between A000 and BFFF t o
memory location 8000 onwards
i.e. the Basic ROM would be
copied t o  loc at ion 8000
onwards,
Go G
The G  instruction has  t h e
following format:
G xxxx
where xxxx is the address from
which you wish to run your
machine code. It is similar to
the Basic command 'RUN
linenumber'. However, with
'G', y o u  mus t ent er  t h e
execution address.
when you run a program,
there is a break instruction (i.e.
001 all of the registers will be
displayed and y ou w ill b e
returned to the monitor. This is
a v ery  handy way  o f  de-
bugging a  mac hine c ode
program as you can force the
program to stop wherever you
want b y  ins er ting ' BR K'
instructions.
Find text F
The 'F' command is used to
search through memory for a
speciﬁc piece of text. Text can
either be a character string in
quotes, e.g. "PRINT", or a hex
number, for example 20, which
is the hex code for space. The
command t ak es  t h e
following format:
F ssss eeee text
where ssss is the address where
you want to start the search,
eeee is the address where you
wish to end the search and text
is the string that you want to
look for . F or  example t he
command;
Put — P
The Put command is used to
put a value into every memory
location between t w o  s et
limits. P  has t h e  following
format:
P ssss eeee xx
Where ssss and eeee are the
start and end address and xx is
the number with which you
wish to ﬁll the memory.

Load —  L

the following format:

the device number and ssss and
eeee are the start and end
address + 1 for the save. Make
sure you remember to add one
to the end address or the last
byte of your program will not
be saved.
Verify — V
It is possible to verify a program
that you have saved with the 'V'
command. All you have to do is
enter:
V text;dd
where text is the ﬁlename and
dd is the device number on
which th e  program t o  b e
veriﬁed is saved.
Decimal to Hex —
This is a very handy command
that will allow you to ﬁnd the
equivalent i n  hex o f  any
decimal number. The format
for the command is:
integer decimal value
C000 "HELLO"
for example # 10 will print out D  ssss eeee
the hex number OA.
Hex to Decimal
where ssss is the address where
you want the string to start and
text is the string. For example
the command:
will store the letters H,E.,L,,L and
0 from location C000 onwards.
Hunt memory — H
The 'H' command will allow
you to search through memory
for any references to a block of
memory. The command has
the following format:
H ssss eeee aaaa bbbb
and will hunt from ssss to eeee
for any references to locations
aaaa to bbbb.
Disassemble — D
It is not only possible to list the
numbers b e tw e e n  t w o
locations but it is also possible
to print a  6502 mnemonic
listing of a block of memory.
This makes a program much
easier to follow than if it was
displayed just i n  numerical
format. The command takes
the form:
where ssss and eeee are the
start and end address for the
disassembly.
Going from hex back t o
decimal is also made very easy. Pri n te r —  *

function. It turns on/off any
printer connected to the serial
bus iLe. lik e a Commodore
printer) and allows you to keep
a p e r ma n e n t  r e c o r d  o f
everything you do.
Back to Basic — X
The command 'X' simply exits
the monitor and places you
back in basic. The only way to
re-enter the monitor is through
a SYS c o m m a n d  t o  b e
described later.
Running The Program
When y ou LO AD Topmon
from tape or disk and RUN it,
you will be asked for the page
where y ou would lik e the
monitor to be placed. Topmon
is f u lly  relocatable whic h
means that you can place it in
any free memory location and
it will work correctly. This is
very handy when y ou ar e
writing programs as you can
place the monitor where it will
not affect what you write.
The me mo r y  i n  y o u r
computer is split up into pages.
One page being 256 bytes of
memory. You can therefore
work out what memory any
page has by using:
page number * 256
If y ou want t o  s it t h e
monitor at a speciﬁc location
you can work this out with the
following bit of maths:
page = location/256
Simple isn't it?
Typing It All In
Topmon is a little complicated
to type in so care must be taken
to follow  t h e  instructions.
When you ﬁrst load Toprpon it
sits a t  t h e  same plac e i n
memory as would a normal
Basic loader. This means that if
the loader for the program was
RUN, Topmon would write
over t h e  program and t he
machine would mor e than
likely hang. Therefore we have
to make the computer think
that a  Bas ic  pr ogr am i s
somewhere else in memory.
LOAD y our  program here,
leaving t h e  nor mal Basic
memory free, and r un t he
program. Then all you have to
do is SAVE Topmon so that you
don't have to go through the
loader each time you want to
use it.
The ﬁrst thing to do is type
in lopmen Load' normally and
save this to tape or disk. Do not
run it or you will have wasted
all of your typing.
Next turn off and on your
C64 and enter the following
line:
POKE 43,0:POKE44,32:NEW
and press RETURN. This will
make the computer think that
Basic now starts at location 2000
hex. Remember that locations
43 and 44 hold the start of Basic.
Now LO AD i n  lo p m o n
load' with the command:
LOAD ''TOPMON LOAD'',8
— for disk or
LOAD "TOPMON LOAD",1
for tape.
then RUN the program and
Toptnon will be moved into the
correct area of memory.
All you have to do now is
save Topmon on to tape. Enter
the following line into the
computer:
P0KE43,1:POKE44,8:POKE45,
40:POKE46,24:CLR
and press RETURN. Make sure
you type the line in exactly as
shown. Now, if you type LIST,
you s hould s ee t h e  name
Topmon appear. If all is well,
then you only need to type:
SAVE "TOPMON",8 for disk
or
SAVE " T O PMO N " ,  1  f o r
tape
and you will have a copy of the
program.
Whenever you want to use
Toprnon in  future then just
follow the above instructions
for running the program.
Errors
If you have made any typing
mistakes you will be told when
you RUN t he 'TOP LOAD'
program. J us t m a k e  t h e
corrections using the normal
C64 screen editor and RUN the
program again.
Entering the program may
sound complicated but is really
extremely easy and you should
have no problems if you follow
the instructions carefully.

memory (elephantine though
it may be) is just not big enough
for that mammoth Basic prog-
ram -  perhaps a never ending
adventure game. Or, possibly
you just want to have two pro-
grams in memory sharing the
same data but you dont want
to save and reload data and
program.
This article describes a tech-
nique for the Basic programmer
which a llo w s  f o r  t h e s e
possibilities without having to
resort to machine language.
How?
The technique is to load your
main program into memory at a
higher address than usual, and
to load a  secondary Basic
program into the usual Basic
area. The two programs can
transfer control to each other
as required and share the same
Basic variables. The secondary
program can be changed by
loading different secondary
programs under the control of
the main program, again pre-
serving variables. I t  sounds
pretty eas y , b u t  success
depends upon following part-
icular rules in a rather strict
fashion.
At t h e  h e a r t  o f  t h e
technique is the manipulation
of the Basic pointers in zero
page (addresses 0 to 255) of the
64's memory. Two key pointers
re those that indicate the
addresses of the start and end

of a Basic program. They are
stored at addresses 43/44 for
the start of program pointer
and 45/46 f o r  t h e  end o f
program pointer. For those
unfamiliar with pointers, I'm
including a short description.
Pointers
A pointer is  a  location i n
memory w h ic h  c ontains
another memor y  address
between z er o a n d  65535.
Nearly all the addresses in the
64 are greater than 255 and,
since one byte can only hold a
number up to 255, two bytes
must b e  used t o  store an
address. These two bytes are
called the low byte and the
high by te and t h e  former
always precedes the latter in
memory. T h e  l o w  by te is
actually a  straightforward
counter going from zero to 255.
When address 256 is reached
the low byte returns to zero
and the high byte is set to one.
Counting would then continue
in the low byte up to address
512 (2 • 256) when the low byte
would again be set to zero and
the high byte would be incre-
mented to two. So any address
is given by:
PEEK (low byte) + 256 * PEEK
(high byte)
At switch-on, the values in
addresses 43 and 44 (the low
and high bytes of the start of
Basic) are one and eight. There-
fore a Basic program would
start at 1 + (256 • 8) or address
2049. Actually, the start of the
Basic programming area is one
byte below this at 2048 and this
byte is always set to zero to
mark the start of the area avail-
able t o  Basic. T h e  Basic
program area actually extends
from 2048 up to 40959 (nearly
38K) a n d  within reason a
program can be placed any-
where within this area.
On The Move
For these examples Basic will
be moved so that it starts at
16384 (some 14K further up the
memory map than usual). This
is achieved in direct mode by
two POKEs and a NEW.
POKE 16384,0 : POKE 44,64
NEW
The ﬁrst POKE t o  16384
marks the start of the new pro-
gramming area in just the same
way as the byte at 2048 is also set
at zero, T he POKE t o  44
changes the actual pointer to
the start of the Basic program,
and t h e  N E W  c ommand
automatically updates all the
other pointers used by Basic.

Only the high by te o f  the
pointer has  been alter ed
because Basic has been moved
by an exact multiple of 256, so
the low  byte is  unaffected.
Moving Basic in multiples of
256 makes the manipulation of
pointers easier when program-
ming. The new address for the
start of a Basic program is now 1
+ (256 * 64) or 16385. If you were
now t o  type a  program o r
LOAD an existing program
from tape. it  would start at
16385 and there would be 14K
of free space under the Basic
program for sprite data, user
deﬁned characters or a high
resolution screen.
In Style
This is all very ﬁne, but rather
clumsy. Surely all this POKEing
and LOADing could be done
under program control? Yes it
could but there are problems.
Typing a program to carry out
the above work, for example;
10 POKE 16384,0 • POKE 44,64 :
NEW : LOAD
will not work because the pro-
gram will be removed from
memory by the NEW before it
gets to LOAD_ Also, the end of
program pointer (45/46) will
not be resest by a LOAD in-
struction issued from within a
1
program, s o Basic w ill get
totally confused.
Fortunately, there is a way
around these problems. By
POKEing instructions into the
keyboard buffer, the 64 can be
instructed t o  carry o u t  a n
operation immediately it exits
from Basic -  after a NEW for
example. Whilst such an in-
struction seems (to the user) to
be under program control, the
64 regards it as having been
issued i n  direct mode and
therefore sets all its pointers
correctly. Listing 1 is a loader
program which achieves this
effect in a little more style than
POKEing in direct mode.
Lines 30 to 70 are purely
cosmetic. Because the LOAD
instruction is issued in direct
mode, the tape will stop and
the screen will display 'FOUND
PROGRAM a s  normal. This
looks a little amateurish, Sc) the
screen is blanked to simulate
one continuous load. The tape
will s till pause f o r  a  f e w
seconds, but nothing will show
on the screen. From line 80
onwards, abbreviated k ey -
words are POKEd into the key-
board buffer. The abbreviated
keywords have been used to
save space, and t he buffer
contains t h e  ins truc tions
'LOAD' and 'RUN' to automat-
ically load and run the next
program on the tape. The last
line copies the commands used
in direct mode. Type Listing 1
now and save it at the begin-
ning of a new tape.
Disk Users Do It Too
Disk users have a slight pro-
blem in that the LOAD instruc-
tions for disk use are too long
to put in the keyboard buffer,
yet they perhaps have the most
to gain from this technique.
However, all is not lost, instead
of the keyboard buffer POKEs
shown in lines 80 to 140 use the
following procedure:
80 NAMES = "PROGRAM"
90 PRINT "[cis] LOAD NAMES,
8 ; RUN"
100 POKE 631,19 : REM cursor
home
110 POKE 632,13 : REM return
120 POKE 198,2 : REM No. of
characters in buffer
I his is a variant of POKEing the
buffer, whereby t h e  actual
instruction is printed on the
screen and the keyboard buffer

simply contains the carriage
returns to enter the line.
Sprites, UDGs And
Hi-res
In itself Listing 1 will be useful. It
is all that is required to relocate
Basic and LOAD any program
which requires access to large
amounts of sprite or character
data, or to a high resolution
screen. These can all ﬁt into the
area from 2048 to 16383 (14K)
without fear of corruption by
Basic and there is still 24K left
for use by a Basic program. Per-
sonally, I think that this is a
more elegant method for most
purposes than resetting the Vic
chip to look at another bank of
memory. Nevertheless, t h e
purpose of this article is to run
two Basic programs c on-
currently, so, here goes.
Now that Basic starts at
16384, you can LOAD the main
program into this space. The
main pr ogr am s hould, o f
course, be recorded on the
tape immediately after t h e
loader program. The ultimate
purpose of the exercise is to
have two programs in memory,
so the ﬁrst task of the main
program should be to LOAD
the secondary program. The
ﬁrst lines of the main program
might therefore look  some-
thing like this:
10 POKE 53281,PEEK (251)
REM restore screen colour
20 POKE 646,PEEK (252) : REM
restore ink colour
30 POKE 44,8 : LOAD
The ﬁrst two lines restore
the screen and ink  colours
which were changed by  the
loader program. The third line
changes t h e  start o f  Basic
pointer back to 2049 and then
LOADs the secondary program
starting at the usual address.
This LOAD can be given from
within a  program because
there is no NEW command, and
must be given from within a
program because the end of
Basic pointers must not be reset
after this LOAD. The only con-
straint is that (in this example)
the second program must not
exceed 14K in length or it will
over-write the main program.
If longer secondary programs
are to be used then the main
programs mus t start higher
than the 16385 used in  this
example. This is achieved by

POKEing a ﬁgure higher than
64 to address 44 in the loader
program. Every increment of
address 44 moves Basic by 256
bytes.
Back To Base
When the secondary program
has LOADed it will automati-
cally be RUN. Note that it will
be t h e  secondary program
which is RUN and not the main
program. Therefore it will nor-
mally b e  necessary f or  the
secondary program immed-
iately to pass control back to
the main program. Assuming
that the main program proper
starts at line 100 (after the three
line loading routine shown
above), then the ﬁrst line of the
secondary program s hould
look like this:
0 POKE 44.64 : POKE 58,255
GOTO 100
The effect of this line is
perhaps not self-evident, but it
serves the purpose of trans-
ferring control between the
two programs. It is listed as line
zero so that it cannot be inad-
vertantly preceded by another
line in the program.
82
The ﬁrs t POKE t o  44,
restores t h e  start o f  Basic
pointer to 16385 (i.e. it points to
the main program). Thesecond
POKE to 58 sets the current
Basic line number to an out of
range ﬁgure. If this were not
done in a jump from a lower (0)
to a higher (100) line number
then Basic would continue
searching for line 100 in the
secondary program with dis-
astrous results. POKEing 58
with 255 fools the 64 into
thinking that it is on a Basic line
with a number of about 65000 -
an illegal ﬁgure - and so it must
start t o  search f r o m  t h e
beginning of the program to
ﬁnd line 100.and the beginning
has just been set to 16385 - the
main program. The last instruc-
tion is obvious - GOTO line 100
- but in the main program not
the current one.
Into Action
Now that the basic concept has
been introduced, it is time to
see it in action. Type in Listing 2
- the main program - and SAVE
it to tape immediately after the
loader program. Then NEW
and type in Listing 3, SAVEing it
to tape immediately after
Listing 2. Finally, NEW and type
Listing 4  SAVEing that after
Listing 3. Got that OK? Before
you LOAD the whole package
let's have a look at what will
happen.
Firstly, the loader program
will LOAD, change the Basic
pointers and LOAD the main
program at 16385. The main
program w i l l  t h e n  R U N ,
changing t h e  Basic pointer
back to 2049 and LOAD the ﬁrst
of the secondary programs.
The secondary program will
then autoRUN and immed-
iately pass control back to the
main program at line 100. At
this point the rather simple
example begins. This is a crude
module permitting movement
between three locations or
rooms. At the start the room
number is set to one. Line 110
changes t h e  start o f  Basic
pointer in 43/44 to point to the
secondary program and then
passes control to that program
at either lines 100, 200 or 300
depending o n  t h e  r o o m
number. T h e  s ec ondary
program then prints the rele-
vant r oom description and,
after changing the start of Basic
pointer bac k  t o  t he main
program a t  16385, returns

C
control to the main program at
line 120.
The remaining lines allow
you to choose between going
backward o r  forward. when
room three is  reached the
command to go forward causes
the program to LOAD the next
secondary module which inter-
acts with the main program in
exactly the same way as the
ﬁrst, but has new desriptions
for each location. If you go past
room three in this program it
will attempt to load a further
module from tape which does
not exist. These programs are
very simplistic but serve t o
make t h e  point. Disk-drive
systems present more scope
than tape only systems because
they can go back and forth
between programs, whilst tape
systems can only go forward.
Load And Run
Rewind t h e  tape now  arid
LOAD the program from the
start using RUN/STOP. If the

c) Control can be transferred

locations 44 and 58.
d) DATA can be READ without

H a r d w a r e
Eric Doyle's artistic talent was'
tested to the full with
Amicron's light pen.
IN THE COMPUTER WORLD FEW ACT-
ivities giv e y ou a  greater sense o f
interaction than the uses of a lightpen. To
actually control the cursor on the screen,
from the screen, has always seemed like
magic t o  me and Amicron's lightpen
provides a very smart magic wand in a
neat little package.
The pen is robust and yet compact,
being no bigger than a normal upmarket
ballpoint pen. The shaft is  made of
stainless steel with a removable plastic tip
which switches on the pen when pressed
against the TV screen. The tip can easily be
pulled out for cleaning and this does
make me a little concerned that, if the tip
were t o  b e lost, the pen would b e
unusable. I'v e tried shaking the pen
around and as yet the tip has remained
ﬁrmly in position, so perhaps I shouldn't
worry too much.
The pen is connected to the joystick
port of the C64 by a coiled lead which
stretches to about two metres. This type of
cable looks very neat and practical, until
you want to use it. Suddenly you ﬁnd your
precious computer has been dragged to
the ﬂoor as you try to overextend the lead.
I suppose t h e  alternative would b e
equally unattractive., having two metres of
cable lying around amongst all the other
necessary cables and connectors.
The pen also includes a software tape
and a booklet which is all you need for
constant experimenting. The tape has the
expected graphics program b u t  also
includes an application demonstration
called Pencalc. This draws a calculator on
screen and you can use the lightpen to
operate its keyboard.
Additionally, the tape has a program
called Pencode which can be used in your
own programs to control the lightpen's
operation. This is because the normal
PEEKs and POKEs recommended b y
Commodore need smoothing out a little.
DRAW
Pill Lf•
Li ghtpens work because the computer
sends its own signal to trigger the tiny
beam of light which draws, or scans, your
TV picture. The computer 'knows' how
long this takes and can calculate where
the scan is at any time during the fraction
of a second which it takes to cover the
screen, line by line. The lightpen pulses a
signal to the computer when the scanning
beam passes its tip and the computer can
then calculate the X and Y coordinates of
the position of the pen.
The Grafﬁti graphics program is fun to
use but, like most graphics packages, it is
an end in  itself rather than being a
programming a i d .  T h e  dr awings
produced can be saved to tape or disk but
there are no instructions on how these
designs can be loaded for use in your own
programs.
As a  demonstration, Grafﬁti is  an
example of icon and lightpen driven soft-
ware. There is room for improvements
such as the inclusion of BOX and CIRCLE
commands though the overall design
using menus calling sub-menus ensures
that the screen remains childishly easy to
operate.
The Pencode program details also
include instructions for reading the pen

co-ordinates. One very useful feature is
the ability to call up sprite zero to auto-
matically shadOw the tip of the lightpen
with a user deﬁned shape.
Using the pen is very simple but like all
lightpens I ﬁnd it to be slightly wayward if
pixel point accuracy is required. This is
not altogether the pen's fault but has
more to do with the difference between
the computer's perfect concept of a frame
scan and the practical reality.
As a  cheap, reliable utility , t he
lightpen functions perfectly well but I
think I  would have preferred more
thought i n  t h e  preparation o f  t he
software. I admit that Amicron, through
Mirrorsoft, are only marketing a lightpen
and that the software is a secondary con-
sideration but for many customers it is the
software that would be the greatest selling
point.

k h e
THE TWO PROGRAMS GIVEN
here are intended to run on a
C128 system with at least one
disk drive. They will work with
1541, 1570 or 1571 disk units.
The ﬁrst program is a utility
for setting-up the so-called
"boot-sector" o n  a  disk t o
allow auto-booting by the 128.
The second program makes use
of this facility to set automat-
ically the 128 to C64 mode and
load a program.
Type in both programs and
save them t o disk. Note, in
Program 2, the REM statements
detailing the ASCII code of the
ﬁrst letter of the CM ﬁle to be
loaded. If you have a program
on your C64 disk which you
wish to load every time you
power-up, then change this to
the ASCII code of the ﬁrst letter
of that ﬁlename.
Setting-up Your Boot
Disk
The process is simple.
1. RUN Program 1. You will be
asked to place your disk in the
drive and press the return key
when you are ready. This disk
will b e  referred t o  subse-
quently as the boot disk. You
will then be asked if you want
to format the disk. I f  y ou
answer "V" you will be asked
for the name of the disk and the
ID. If you give only the disk
name ( and press only  t h e
return key when asked for the
ID) a directory clear-out will be
performed. O ther w is e a
complete format operation will
follow. Next., t h e  program
makes sure that the disk boot
sector is  free. I f  not, t h e
program will stop indicating
that some other program is
using this sector. If all is well
you will be asked for the name
and type of the ﬁle you wish to
autoboot. The ﬁle type is either
Basic or Binary (machine code).
Note here that to set up the C64
autoboot program, you must
give the ﬁlename used in the
BSAVE command in Program 2
and t he ﬁle ty pe must b e
Binary. W h e n  y o u  h a v e
selected t h e  ﬁle type, t h e
program performs the set-up.

BSAVE command is correct and
check that the ﬁrst letter of the
C64 ﬁlename is correct.
3. Place your boot disk in the
drive and RUN Program 2. The
machine code ﬁle will be saved
to disk.
4. I f  y ou already hav e a
program on the disk which will
load in C64 mode, then you can
try out the disk by  simply
pressing the reset button. I f
you don't have a  program
ready, type in the small demo
program below:
10 PRINT "[CLR] NOW IN CM
MODE"
20 PRINT "[DOWN1[DOWNI
YOUR COMMODORE 1986"
Save this with a ﬁlename begin-
ning w i t h  t h e  letter  y o u
selected in  Program 2. Now
press the reset button, The
following should happen:
1. The usual 128 title screen
appears.
2. T h e  message BOOTING
--: ﬁlename , appears.
3. The machine enters C M
mode.
4. The program loads and runs.
Program 2  has checksum
error detection facilities which
will detect any error in the
numeric values contained in
the DATA lines. Since one error
may cancel out another, be
sure to check your typing.
The C64 Autoboot
Pr ogr am (program 2)
Program 2 works by changing
the memory conﬁguration to
that used by C64 mode and
then simulating the CM ROM
cold start routines. Finally, it
ﬁlls the keyboard buffer with
the characters to load and run
the CM program.
The program resides i n
bank Lem RAM memory at
address 3000 hex. Since this is
the bank used by CM mode.
Any machine code programs in
the area 0802-CFFF hex are un-
affected by the mode change.
What follows is basically an
inspired guess since no pro-
grammer's reference guide is
yet available (Commodore
please note!).
The Memory Management
Unit (MMU) resides in the I/O
space at D500 hex with the ﬁrst
ﬁve registers 113500-D504 hex)
also appearing at address MO
in all banks. Most of the system
software addresses the MMU at
FF00. As far as I can gather from

long sessions o f  "hacking"
about, address FFOO is  t he
memory conﬁguration control
register. Addresses FF01 to FF04
(apparently read only -  but
read on) seem to act as preset
conﬁguration switches/latches
which, when stored to (e.g. STA
SFF01) set FFOO to the value
contained i n  t h e m .  F o r
example, FF01 n o r m a lly
contains the MMU value for
Bank zero (.3F hex). The instruc-
tion STA FF01 regardless of the
contents o f  the accumulator
will change FF00 to the value in
FF01 (3F hex). These preset
values may b e  changed by
addressing locations D501 t o
0504 but since the system is
always r u n n in g .  I  d o n ' t
recommend it!

But it's true of all the programs in the BUSICALC series.
BUSICALC 3 can handle all sorts of jobs - budgets, expenditure analysis, stock lists,
price lists, and product costing are just a few of the possibilities. Three-dimensional
formulae automatically access data stored on disk, so that you can easily pull
together information from several different sheets and summarise or manipulate it.
It's simple to transfer data to other programs such as Easy Script. And you can use
virtually any printer with BUSICALC 3, whether dot matrix or daisy wheel,
Commodore or non-Commodore.
