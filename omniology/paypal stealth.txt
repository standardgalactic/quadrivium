INTRODUCTION 
Understanding how PayPal acts, can help you anticipate what their next likely 
move will be, regarding Your Account. 
 
What makes PayPal the company they are today? 
PayPal's public face is very different from the private PayPal that many of us 
never see. While PayPal denies publicly they have a customer service problem, 
they admit they have a customer service problem in private. 
 
While PayPal denies publicly they don't make any money off of your money, 
PayPal admits it in legal documents. PayPal publicly says their buyer protection 
is there for buyers, but in private PayPal admits the policy is there to prevent 
costly chargebacks.

STEALTHING PAYPAL ACCOUNTS 
 
This first part is for teach you how to be "stealth" on Paypal and how to actually 
get the money out. This guide is not about money laundering or scamming, 
although perhaps some of this information can be used to figure out some 
schemes on your own.  
 
I currently have 3 Paypal accounts that I use, and 2 backup accounts just in 
case. None are in my name or anyone related to me. It is always a good idea to 
have one Paypal account that is legit, meaning you don't do any BS with it. This 
is your main account that you don't want to compromise. If you are already 
banned from Paypal, this is OK, you just need to create a new Paypal with a 
different name. The purpose of this main account is to use to withdraw your 
money.  
 
You can have as many stealth accounts as you want. You NEVER want to link 
any of your stealth accounts to your main account, i.e., send money directly 
from one to the other. Paypal will ban accounts that they link to a suspended 
account, should one of your stealth accounts get banned. They will see that the 
banned account received x amount of dollars, and every time sends same 
amount to the other account. Its really not that difficult.  
 
How to create a new account  
If you've never had Paypal before, this is good, as you have a fresh start. It is 
OK to have a Paypal account that has your real info on it, as long as you just 
use it for innocent purposes, like selling or buying online.  
 
I will not go in to detail about opening a genuine PP account, as it is pretty self 
explanatory. If you are banned, or just want another legit/main account for back 
up reasons, you basically make this new account the same way as you would 
create a stealth account. The only difference is how you use it.  
 

Paypal Ninja´s Secrets

It is best to use you main Paypal account on a separate browser than your 
stealth accounts. This just prevents accidents, like forgetting to log out, 
forgetting to clear cookies, and IP address/proxy issues.  
 
Whenever you are done doing whatever it is you are doing, log and and clear 
your cookies and cache. I suggest using the same firefox portable as in the 
TOR browser bundle. All this is cleared automatically when you close the 
browser.  
 
You need to first find a region-specific IP address to use as a proxy. There are 
many paid proxy services who do this. Don't use TOR, Paypal can detect it and 
will limit/ban your new account.  
 
One thing I like to do is to use a free webhost and set up a basically useless 
site/page. Once they manually review the site, I put in a php proxy script to use 
so that I get a US IP address. If you implement this method, you must use a 
different host or at least create a new website within that host to get on a 
different server, or the IP address can be the same.  
 
It's just one of the things I like to do. A sourceforge link for the proxy will be 
located at the end of this guide. Now that you have your proxy, check it on 
www.dawhois.com or other site and make sure it is working.  
 
Next you need a new email account (new for every paypal account you create). 
I prefer yahoo since they never ask for phone verification and I can create 
yahoo accounts through TOR. Using a new email and IP address for every 
paypal account is MANDATORY! If you use the same IP for 2 accounts, it 
may as well be one account, it will only be a matter of time before they link them 
and ban them both.  
 
You are going to want to get verified on at least one account, your main 
account. Your spending and withdraw limits will be lifted once verified, and this 
is the main reason to do this. Unverified accounts can only withdraw 500USD 
per month, but there is no online spending limit.  

Paypal Ninja´s Secrets

If you live in US, Canada or Australia the only way to verify a Paypal account is 
by attaching it to a bank account. Fortunately, BY LAW, Paypal cannot see the 
name attached to the bank account. This is why they send 2 small deposits to it. 
You seeing the deposits and entering them in to Paypal "verifies" that you are 
the owner of the account.  
 
If you live in Europe and most countries outside US you will need a valid debit 
or credit card to verify a Paypal account. 
 
This is good to know just in case you lose your main account, all you need to do 
is open a new bank account or virtual card and start a new, verified Paypal 
account. Just make sure that you use a new bank account or card number with 
every account you wish to get verified. Having an account linked to a real bank 
account is ideal, since to get your money out, all you have to do is send it to the 
bank or use the Paypal debit card at an ATM (US residents).  
 
But, not everybody can or wants to do this. If for any reason you don't want to 
use your own bank account, or want to verify other stealth accounts but not 
withdraw straight to the bank with them, you can buy a VBA, Virtual Bank 
Account or VCC virtual debit cards with cvv code. 
 
These accounts are used only for verification. You can never withdraw your 
paypal funds direct to VBA account, as it becomes obsolete after it is used. 
Unless paypal has a reason to withdraw from your bank account, they will never 
know that the account is closed.

CASH OUT ANONYMOUS 
This is the important part, and not surprisingly, the part most people screw up. 
Screw it up once, and link accounts, you risk having your money frozen, AKA, 
lost for good. Here are some of most used methods to retrieve your funds from 
Paypal. 
 
e-Bay method: 
The easiest way is to buy digital goods as vouchers, coupons or bitcoins from e-
Bay auctions. You must to create a good stealth ebay account and after assign 
your Paypal account. 
 
Escrow sites method 
Other easy way is to use re-seller sites and freelance sites. http://fiverr.com , 
http://freelancer.com and others that offer an escrow service. This method 
should also be used to transfer from any paypal to paypal accounts that you 
own.  Never link your accounts! Just like with paypal, set up accounts both as 
seller and buyer on however many sites you want to use. You really only need 
one seller account on each, and as many buyer accounts as you with.  
 
Again, use new IPs and emails for every account. It is not only fine, but 
recommended to pair each account with the same IP/Email combo as the 
stealth paypal account it corresponds to. It's just easier to keep track of the 
combo this way. Paypal will only see the escrow transaction, and the link 
between the stealth and main account is broken.  
 
Anonymous card method 
1. Open an EU paypal account from one of the countries below. You can 
use fakenamegenerator.com or whatever you want. 
2. Just make sure is is a merchant and not personal. There are 3 levels, go 
with the middle.  
3. Get an anonymous debit card over web, and link it to the Paypal, using 
the CC and not the bank. I know for sure that the bank wont work for US 
accounts, as it is a deposit only bank account number. Depending on the 

Paypal Ninja´s Secrets 
8 
 
country and the country's banking regs, paypal may or may not try to 
take back the verification amount they sent. Forget that. 
4. Once the Paypal and debit card are connected successfully, it is time to 
get cash out your money. Just look at card withdrawal option and transfer 
your funds to your anonymous card.   
Look at https://www.paypal.com/worldwide/ and search countries that Paypal 
allows withdrawals to cards. 
 
Credit card to IBAN method 
You register online with GlobalWebPay http://www.globalwebpay.com  
You provide us with the money you wish to send (Either with CC or Bank).  
Funds are typically received by the recipient within 3 working days but often the 
next working day. Get some fresh CC's/ -Anon Iban Accounts good VPN 
network and ready to go. And just start cashing out all day from different CC to 
different IBAN. 
 
Exchanges sites method 
Another good method is to use money exchanges websites to change Paypal 
for Liberty Reserve, bitcoins, WebMoney, etc. But few sites accept Paypal 
because it is refundable and high risk for traders. Good and trusted sites:

Believe it or not, these are all reasons as to why PayPal can and will limit your 
account. With a limited or frozen PayPal account, you have NO access to your 
own money. There are many, many more reasons as to why PayPal will limit 
your account and deny you access to your money. Any number of things 
unknown to you or I can trigger such an event. 
 
The reason why this is so disturbing is this: once your account is limited, you 
have a less than 10% chance of getting your account unlimited. That means 
less than a 10% chance of getting your account restored to its previous state -- 
because you made a mistake that you did not know was a mistake or PayPal 
accused you of something without having or offering any evidence as to your 
guilt. 
 
The simple whim of PayPal can destroy your business and your online 
reputation. The simple whim of PayPal can freeze access to funds that you 
need to support your family, pay bills, take that dream vacation or replace the 
busted tires on your car.  
 
Most disturbing of all: PayPal does not need a reason to freeze your funds and 
limit your account. Remember, PayPal says in its User Agreement (that you 
agreed to) that it can limit and freeze your funds for "any reason."  
 
Maybe PayPal needs a large infusion of cash for whatever reason -- or a short 
term loan on your money. PayPal can freeze accounts on a mass level for no 
reason at all. Why? Because PayPal CAN.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Paypal Ninja´s Secrets

RESTORING LIMITED ACCOUNTS 
In the event that PayPal limits your account as a result of suspected fraud or 
other problem, you can restore it to its original, unrestricted state. 
 
If PayPal determines that you have been engaging in fraudulent or high-risk 
activity (such as selling fake merchandise or using stolen credit cards) or that 
you have not been abiding by the terms of the user agreement (e.g., you've 
been using PayPal to sell pornographic material or weapons) PayPal will 
impose limits on your account.  
 
Your account might also be limited if you initiate a bank transfer that then fails 
due to insufficient funds or if you accept a payment that is later disputed by its 
sender. 
 
PayPal often limits the account's access to certain features, such as sending, 
withdrawing, oreven receiving money. This helps protect any other PayPal 
users with whom you've been dealing and helps reduce subsequent losses that 
PayPal would otherwise have to incur. 
 
You know that PayPal has limited your account when your Account Overview 
page has a pink box that says Account Access Limited. As you might expect, 
click the "Click here for details" link for an explanation. 
 
PayPal prides itself on being good at spotting high-risk behavior, but they also 
recognize that not all high-risk transactions are necessarily fraudulent or bad 
and not all disputes are the seller's fault. Thus, PayPal has an appeals process 
for those who have had their accounts limited. 
 
Filing an Appeal 
Needless to say, the best thing you can do if your account has been limited is to 
precisely follow the instructions on the web site and in the notification email you 
receive.  
 

Paypal Ninja´s Secrets 
15 
 
Often, this entails completing a sequence of steps to provide PayPal with 
evidence of ownership of the PayPal account, ownership of the financials 
attached to the account, and verification of your own identity and address. 
 
Only after you have completed all the required steps will a PayPal Account 
Review Representative review your account. For instance, if PayPal asks you to 
fax several documents, your account will not be reviewed until you submit all 
requested documents and have completed all the remaining steps. 
 
In addition, make sure to double-check the email you received notifying you of 
your account's limited access, because the PayPal Account Review 
Representative might have added extra steps for you to complete that are not 
listed on the web site.  
 
For instance, if you are a seller on eBay, PayPal will likely request tracking 
information for items you've delivered and proof of inventory for additional items 
you're currently selling.  
 
If you lose the email, you might not necessarily be able to find all the steps to 
complete on the PayPal web site; in this case, your best bet is to call PayPal.  
 
However, if you no longer have access to your email account, you might have 
bigger problems to deal with than just your limited account. 
 
A Last Resort 
If you're really in a bind and cannot complete the steps requested of you for 
legitimate reasons, you can always escalate your issue by writing a letter to a 
PayPal executive, contacting the Better Business Bureau, or working with a 
legal representative.  
 
Escalation in itself is not a guarantee that your issue will be resolved, but if your 
issue is legitimate, it is likely that a new pair of eyes, perhaps with more 

Paypal Ninja´s Secrets 
16 
 
experience and background, will look at your issue and help reach a fair 
resolution. 
 
Avoiding Suspicion 
To prevent your account from being limited in the first place, keep your account 
in order by following these guidelines: 
1. Treat your PayPal account as you would your bank account: use secret 
passwords and keep them to yourself! 
2. Make sure your true name is on your PayPal account and that it matches 
the name on your bank and credit card accounts. If you are a business, 
make sure the bank account and credit card on your account are also in 
your business name. 
3. Use accurate addresses and phone numbers that match those on your 
credit card and bank account, and keep them current. False contact 
information can raise suspicion on your account and make it more 
difficult to regain access. 
4. Delete old or obsolete bank accounts and credit cards from your account. 
If you do not keep your account up-to-date, you might find yourself in a 
bind when your account is limited and PayPal asks you to prove 
ownership of a bank account with an old address. 
5. If you are a seller, always use electronically trackable shipping methods 
so that if the shipment or receipt of a physical good is in doubt, you can 
easily prove your case. Also make sure to keep proof of inventory or 
merchandise, such as receipts, invoices, or proof of authenticity for older, 
collectible items. Maintain good relationships with your suppliers so that 
you can easily access this information when you need it. 
6. If you have any old or abandoned PayPal accounts, make sure to resolve 
your issues with those accounts and then close them. If your account has 
been limited and PayPal sees linked accounts with issues, such as a 
negative balance or outstanding buyer complaints, PayPal will probably 
ask you to resolve those issues as well before they'll be willing to lift the 
limitation on your active account.

Nuke PayPal With Complaints 
If PayPal freezes your account for no reason and denies you access to your 
money for 6 months or more, or even though you were the victim of fraud and 
PayPal sided with the scammer, your options for getting your money back 
and/or being compensated for your loss boils down to three options:  
 
You can try to work it out with PayPal, you can take PayPal to court (small 
claims or a higher court) or you can file complaints that will pressure PayPal to 
see things your way. 
 
If you are here, that means you are considering filing a complaint against 
PayPal. If you are considering this, be sure that you have exhausted all of your 
options in terms of negotiating with PayPal first. That means, if you are having 
PayPal problems, do not file a complaint against PayPal until you have 
contacted PayPal and tried to resolve the issue with them. This is important for 
a couple of reasons.  
 
First, if you file a complaint against PayPal without dealing with them first (even 
though WE know that does little to no good), you will be informed by the 
persons or agencies that you are making complaints to to contact PayPal first 
and try to resolve the issue with them first. Your complaint will then go nowhere.  
 
Second, it is important to contact PayPal first because you can gather all of the 
evidence that you need to do PayPal real damage when you file your complaint. 
Without some kind of evidence showing that you attempted to work the problem 
out with PayPal, your complaint will either be dismissed or rendered completely 
useless. 
 
When contacting PayPal with your problem, first attempt to communicate with 
them via email. After you have sent them an email, immediately go to the 
telephone and call PayPal. Do not tell PayPal that you have sent them an email 
on this issue.  
 

Paypal Ninja´s Secrets 
18 
 
Write down what time you called, what you said, and what the PayPal 
representative said. If you can get that person's first name, write that down as 
well.  
 
After you get off the phone with PayPal, evaluate if what transpired helps you or 
solves nothing. Wait an hour or more and call PayPal again. With any luck you 
will have a different customer service representative. Go through your whole 
problem again WITHOUT MENTIONING that you called before about the same 
problem.  
 
Based on that information, go through the motions of trying to comply with what 
PayPal wants of you. Now, check your email and see if PayPal has replied. If 
PayPal has replied, write down how long it took them to reply. Copy the email 
and keep it together with your original email that you sent them.  
 
After looking at what you have thus far, I bet that what the people at PayPal told 
you is different than what your email is saying. I bet that what PayPal told you 
over the telephone is different than what somebody else at PayPal told you over 
the phone!  
 
You are now building evidence against PayPal to use in your complaints. 
 
Based on the information that you have thus far, this is how it all pieces 
together. Here is an incomplete complaint letter showing how this fits together: I 
have been a PayPal account holder for 1 year. I recently sold a computer via 
eBay. I received payment for my computer via the PayPal service. After I 
received the money into my PayPal account I shipped the computer to my 
buyer. When I logged into my PayPal account PayPal told me was account was 
frozen and I could not have access to my money! PayPal accused me of 
"suspicious activity." That is ridiculous! Paypal asked me to fax them a copy of 
my ID, credit card statement and utility bill showing my address. I did this and 
PayPal still won't let me have my money!  
 
 

Paypal Ninja´s Secrets 
19 
 
(Here comes the info you just collected) 
I contacted PayPal via email -- it took them three days to reply. When I did get 
the reply it had NOTHING to do with what I had written. They are jerking me 
around. A copy of my email and PayPal's reply is attached. I called PayPal 
TWICE -- On January 16 at 3PM and January 17 at 630PM. The first time the 
customer rep (John -- he would not give me his last name or an employee 
number or anything) told me XXXXXXXXXX.  
 
That did not help me in the least. I then called PayPal again and this customer 
service representative (Janice) told me something completely different! She told 
me XXXXXXXXX.  
 
PayPal will not even provide me with evidence showing me what this 
"suspicious activity was."  
 
But I had to supply PayPal with plenty of very private information! In the end the 
refuse to give me my money back! 
 
Obviously there will be much more to your complaint -- and your complaint will 
be customized towards who you are complaining to (example: your complaint 
would differ based on if you were writing to a federal law enforcement center 
verses complaining to a state agency concerned with money transfer issues). 
 
Next, you have to decide WHY you are complaining and WHAT YOU WANT. It 
does not help to complain unless you describe what you want. In our above 
example you are showing that PayPal is unfair and conducting questionable 
and illegal business practices to hold your money (for its benefit).  
 
You are also describing in your complaint what you want: you want PayPal to 
return your money NOW. Not in 6 months, not next week and not tomorrow. 
You want your money now. By saying what you want, it will make it easier for 
the persons or agencies you are complaining to contact PayPal and pressure 
them to return your money. 
 

Paypal Ninja´s Secrets 
20 
 
If, in this example, you did not say what you wanted, the persons or agencies 
that you complained to might only contact PayPal about their questionable 
business practices -- and not the fact that you want your money back.  
 
So decide WHY you are complaining and decide WHAT YOU WANT. 
 
Once you have contacted PayPal and gone through the motions of contacting 
PayPal to resolve the issue, and once you have gathered all of your 
documentation and evidence, you are ready to take on PayPal. If you want to 
avoid court or having to file lawsuits to solve your PayPal problem, you have to 
get other people to fight your cause for you -- for free.  
 
That is where "federal resources" come in. There are government agencies -- 
and national complaints organizations -- who will take your complaint and then 
take it to PayPal.  
 
These government agencies and organizations carry far more weight, power 
and influence than any letter thatyou could write to PayPal yourself. Often 
times, PayPal will cave in to your demands and solve your problem just from 
having these agencies and organizations contact them and threaten them with 
further action should they continue with their behavior. 
 
That is the factor that you must count on: The pressure from these 
organizations and the pressure that PayPal will feel from receiving other 
complaints from thousands of others. It will be cheaper and less risky to solve 
your problem than to have PayPal challenged by a federal government agency 
or court. To begin the process of getting your money back you can file your 
complaint with the following federal organizations: 
 
United States Senators 
Every state has two United States Senators. These two people are elected on a 
state wide basis and represent your entire state in Washington D.C.. Your 
United States Senators have enormous power and enormous influence.  
 

Paypal Ninja´s Secrets 
21 
 
A simple letter or phone call from a U.S. Senator's office can move mountains 
or force dogs and cats to sleep together.  
 
Why will they help you? Every United States Senator has an office that deals 
with constituent complaints involving a number of issues -- every problem 
imaginable are handled by your United States Senators' office.  
 
Second, they want to get re-elected. Unlike PayPal, your government 
representatives serve at the pleasure of the voters. They figure if they can help 
you, you will be grateful and vote for them in the next election. Fair trade. 
Contact your TWO United States's Senators with your PayPal problem.  
 
Don't forget to include why you think PayPal was unjust to you and mention the 
fact that PayPal has a history of screwing its customers. You may submit your 
complaint via email or you may write them a letter.  
 
http://www.senate.gov  (When you get there, look in the upper right corner of 
the page to find your U.S. Senator) 
 
United States Congressman/Woman 
Unlike Senators, where every state has two, your state has anywhere from one 
to over 50 United States Congressman/woman. These people are elected in 
districts.  
In 
your 
congressional 
district, 
you 
have 
ONE 
United 
States 
Congressman/woman. Like U.S. Senators,these people have a huge amount of 
power and influence. Like Senators, members of Congress deal with a huge 
amount of voter problems -- you name the topic, and they can and will help you.  
 
One phone call or letter from them can solver your PayPal problem. You can 
contact your member of Congress via email or write them a letter.

The United States Department of Justice 
The Department of Justice is the federal government's chief law enforcement 
agency and prosecutorial office. You can file a complaint with them via email or 
write them a letter.  
http://www.justice.gov 
 
The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) 
The FTC deals with issues that touch the economic life of every American. It is 
the only federal agency with both consumer protection and competition 
jurisdiction in broad sectors of the economy. 
 
The FTC pursues vigorous and effective law enforcement; advances 
consumers’ interests... In short, these are the guys that PayPal is really afraid 
of. You can file your complaint with them online. 
https://www.ftccomplaintassistant.gov 
 
The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) 
Why in the world would anybody complaint to these guys? Don't they have 
something to do with the stock market or something? You are correct, they 
regulate all companies that are trading stock publicly.  
 
They also are very concerned with companies who engage in fraudulent activity 
which might manipulate their stock price and give investors a false picture of the 
truth of a company's heath. 
 
Your approach is this: PayPal freezes customer accounts so they can artificially 
inflate the amount of cash reserves that they have (remember, your money is 
held in pooled bank accounts under PayPal's name).  
 
This is an issue the SEC would be very interested in. Who knows, maybe 
PayPal is involved in some kind of fishy accounting practices (remember 
Enron?). You can file a complaint with the SEC online.

The Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) 
Report PayPal to this feared and effective government task force. Your aim 
here is to highlight the criminal and fraudulent nature of PayPal's activities. 
 You must be able to detail how PayPal wronged you and stole your money. 
http://www.ic3.gov/complaint/default.aspx 
 
Council of the Better Business Bureau 
The Better Business Bureau is another group that PayPal has to answer to -- 
first because it has enormous influence and second, PayPal is a member. 
http://www.bbb.org 
 
National Consumer Law Center 
"The National Consumer Law Center (NCLC) is the nation’s consumer law 
expert, helping consumers, their advocates, and public policy makers use 
powerful and complex consumer laws on behalf of low-income and vulnerable 
Americans seeking economic justice.  
 
Today’s consumer marketplace is complex and full of potholes, even for those 
of us with all the necessary skills and advantages. For unsuspecting low-income 
consumers it’s far more treacherous - even the smallest misstep can lead to 
financial ruin and a sense of hopelessness that paralyzes individual progress."  
If you would like to contact the National Consumer Law Center to help with your 
PayPal problem, you can do so online. 
http://www.nclc.org 
 
The National White Collar Crime Center (NW3C) 
They will help you with filing a complaint against PayPal showing you how to do 
it and lots of other places that you can go to.  
 
White collar crime is a term coined for something that PayPal does: it is fraud 
and outright theft committed by those wearing a white shirt and tie to work 
everyday.

Suing PayPal in Small Claims Court 
So you have decided to sue PayPal. You've got all your papers filled out and 
you are ready to go to the post office.  
 
There's just ONE problem: You have no idea where to send your legal papers. 
All states require proper service of your legal papers. Proper service includes 
sending your papers to the right place.  
 
If you send your legal papers to the wrong address, PayPal can force dismissal 
of your lawsuit based on the grounds that you "improperly served" them. 
Remember, it's PayPal's goal to stay out of courtrooms -- they know they 
cannot win if they must argue the merits of their case.  
 
However, one of the ways they will try to beat you is on a technicality. Don't let 
them beat you because you got the address wrong. From the first sentence to 
the last, we uncovered all the details for you! Since PayPal became a major 
player in the online payments market, PayPal's user agreement has been 
modified hundreds of times -- and unless ordered by a court or a regulatory 
body -- the terms are NEVER in our favor.

RETURNING AFTER SUSPENSION  
First, you must understand that Paypal records much of your data for later use. 
Not only do they record data you filled out in their seller application form (name, 
address, phone number, SSN, credit card, paypal email), they also logged your 
IP address and others.  
 
You may not even know about these items yourself, but yes Paypal logs the 
things you don't know. They have the right to do so because you have agreed it 
once you agreed their terms of service as an eBay member.  
 
1. Change your internet service provider, or VPN, request a new fixed IP 
address. If you are connected with dynamic IP you can skip this step. 
Ask your ISP if you don't know if you are connecting with fixed or 
dynamic IP. To view your IP address visit http://dawhois.com  
 
2. Call your credit card company and ask for a different card number. It will 
be even less suspicious to eBay if you will use a card with different card 
holder name. (Think about adding a family member or friend as a user on 
the bank account. Get them their own check card. Use theirs.) 
 
3. Get a new mailing address. (you can find companies that do this for a 
small fee, search online) 
 
4. Get a new phone number (cell phone number is acceptable). (check 
google voice, which is free) 
 
5. Give credit card company your new mailing address for your monthly 
statement.  
6. Re-register using your new name, the new address and phone number 
but ALWAYS a different email address. Do NOT use email from your 
private domain. Use those free emails from Google, Yahoo, MSN, or 
whatever. 
 

Paypal Ninja´s Secrets 
26 
 
7. Open a new Paypal account with new banking account/credit 
card/email/mailing address connected. 
 
8. Consider using a virtual private network or proxy every time you connect 
to PayPal.  
 
Understanding how PayPal detects and frozen multiple accounts 
Paypal is able to link your accounts based on Your IP Address, Web browser as 
well as Flash cookies, and Private Account Information.  
 
PayPal stores temporary Internet files on your computer every time you login to 
your account. That is why it is important to clear your cookies and a temporary 
Internet file is a must prior to accessing your account.  
 
Additionally, the information that you provide when setting up your account such 
as personal information, bank account number, phone number, etc, will flag 
your account.  
 
Deleting Your Browser and Flash Cookies 
We recommend that you delete your browser cookies and flash objects before 
proceeding from here. If you’re not sure how to delete your cookies or flash 
objects, please type “deleting browser cookies” and “flash-cookies” in any 
search engine.  
 
What exactly are Flash Cookies?  
- A data file created by a Web site you visit or a Flash application you run that is 
stored in your computer. Officially called a "local shared object" (LSO), it 
functions like a regular browser cookie (see cookie) to personalize the user's 
experience, except that a Flash cookie can hold up to 100KB instead of 4KB. 
Clearing cookies in the Web browser does not clear Flash cookies. 
 
Flash cookies are managed and cleared via Flash Player Settings activated

How To Change, Renew, and Release Your IP Addresses 
To see your own IP Address, please visit http://dawhois.com  
 
What exactly is an IP Address?  
(Internet Protocol address) The address of a device attached to an IP network 
(TCP/IP network). Every client, server and network device is assigned an IP 
address, and every IP packet traversing an IP network contains a source IP 
address and a destination IP address. 
 
Remember, Paypal always saves your IP address each time you login to your 
account so make sure you don’t accidentally login with a suspended IP address. 
 
We recommend contacting your Internet provider to make certain you own a 
dynamic IP address or changing your IP address. For those of you that have a 
cable modem, and are directly connected without the use of a network or router 
you must release your IP address.  
 
Also, keep a log of your IP Address and always verify your IP address at 
http://dawhois.com before you sign in to your EBay/PayPal Accounts.

PROTECTION AGAINST FRAUDS 
Use PayPal's Seller Protection Policy to ensure that you don't lose money to 
fraudulent payments. Whether you use PayPal as a buyer or a seller, you need 
to be on the lookout for fraud. If you don't take the proper steps to protect 
yourself, PayPal might need to retract a payment from your account, even after 
you've filled the customer's order.  
 
For instance, a credit card holder can dispute any credit card payment, even 
after you've received the payment and delivered the goods or service the 
customer agreed to buy. This is the customer's right and it can be an effective 
means of buyer protection, but dishonest buyers can also abuse this service to 
intimidate or cheat honest sellers.  
 
Furthermore, a person using a PayPal account to pay you might have hijacked 
the account from its rightful owner, or someone might have funded a PayPal 
payment with a stolen credit card.  
 
Either way, the rightful owner will, understandably, dispute any such charges 
once she has discovered them. PayPal's Seller Protection Policy can mitigate 
the risk, often to the point of allowing you to keep disputed funds, but the best 
way to avoid fraud is to spot it going in. Look below some ways to minimize your 
risk as a seller. 
 
Qualifying for Seller Protection 
If you are a U.S. or Canadian seller dealing with U.S. buyers or a UK seller 
transacting with UK or U.S. buyers, you might qualify for PayPal's Seller 
Protection Policy, which covers up to $5,000 per year of reversals. To qualify, 
you must do all of the following: 
• Ship a tangible product. 
• Ship only to a confirmed shipping address. 
• Ship promptly and use some form of package tracking. 
• Respond quickly to any complaints, either from the customer or from PayPal. 

Paypal Ninja´s Secrets 
29 
 
• 
Meet 
additional 
requirements 
discussed 
at 
https://www.paypal.com/sellerprotection  
and http://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=p/gen/ua/policy_spp-outside 
 
If you follow these guidelines diligently, you might be able to avoid losses to 
buyer fraud completely. Possibly the best indicator of a buyer's reputability is his 
accounts Status.  
 
Holders of verified accounts have shown PayPal that they are in fact in control 
of the email addresses on file with PayPal and have legitimate bank accounts. 
PayPal trusts these members more than unverified account holders, so it makes 
sense for you to trust them as well.  
 
Your prospective buyer's account creation date tells you how long the buyer has 
been a PayPal member. Buyers using relatively new PayPal accounts or 
accounts with low reputation numbers have a short track record as PayPal 
members, but this doesn't mean they can't be trusted. 
 
However, you might want to avoid doing business with buyers until they become 
better established. A long-standing account is less likely to have been set up 
with the commission of fraud in mind. On the other hand, accounts of any age 
can, and sometimes are, hijacked by phishers and crackers. 
 
Conducting a Little Reconnaissance 
Here are some tips to help you decide whether to do business with any 
particular person: 
 
1. If you're at all suspicious, take it one step further and look for any recent 
purchasing activity that appears out of the ordinary (such as numerous 
high-value items). At the eBay site, go to SearchBy Bidder, type the 
customer's user ID, indicate that you want to include completed items, 
and click Search. 
 

Paypal Ninja´s Secrets 
30 
 
2. Consider the buyer's reputation. In addition to the user status information 
provided by PayPal, do you have other sources you can use to gather 
information? If you're conducting business via eBay or another auction 
site, check your buyer's feedback rating or community reputation. 
 
3. Also, look for a history of fraud or payment disputes in the recent 
comments from other sellers.  
 
4. Contact the buyer. For any item, especially one that is expensive and 
easily resold, it makes sense to contact the buyer directly. Email to 
confirm purchase details or on the premise of confirming that the product 
will really suit the buyer's needs. Be particularly wary if the buyer takes 
little interest in your questions. Some social engineering and a nose for 
fraud can save major headaches. 
 
5. Use common sense. If you sell only Beanie Babies, ball bearings, and 
body oil on your eCommerce web site and a single buyer suddenly 
orders ten boxes, bushels, and bottles of each, ask a few questions 
before shipping. 
 
6. In the end, you will probably choose to do business with most of the 
customers you encounter. But a little common sense and awareness can 
7. protect you from most types of fraud. 
 
Protecting Yourself From Chargebacks 
Reduce or eliminate the risk of having disputed payments reversed from your 
PayPal account.  
 
A chargeback is the result of a credit card charge being rejected by the credit 
card holder, typically in cases where the credit card was stolen and used 
fraudulently.  
 
But such charges can also be disputed by customers who feel that they've been 
defrauded by sellers. If you accept credit cards, in person or through PayPal, 

Paypal Ninja´s Secrets 
31 
 
you might encounter a chargeback from a buyer, just as a seller accepting 
personal checks might receive an occasional bad check. 
 
Chargebacks are an unfortunate but realistic cost of doing business, so most 
sellers factor this cost into their business plans.  
 
When a customer initiates a chargeback with his or her credit card company, 
PayPal may deduct the amount of the transaction from your account if you're 
not covered under PayPal's Seller Protection Policy.  
 
All sellers who accept credit card payments run this risk and might be liable for 
chargebacks. Even if you have a low-volume online business, you cannot avoid 
the risk of chargebacks. 
 
According to a study by the Gartner Group, approximately 1.1% of online 
transactions are estimated to result in fraudulent buyer chargebacks. That's like 
paying an extra 1.1% fee for each and every transaction!  
 
Of course, chargeback risk varies a good deal depending on the type of goods 
you sell, but nearly everyone who accepts credit card payments faces some 
chargeback risk.  
 
Of course, none of this applies to non-credit card transactions, such as 
payments funded by a bank account transfer or PayPal balance. 
 
Protecting Yourself 
Whereas most merchant account providers and payment companies simply 
pass all of the chargeback risks and associated fees and liabilities on to sellers, 
PayPal is different.  
 
As long as you follow PayPal's guidelines (the Seller Protection Policy outlines 
these guidelines), PayPal helps protect you against fraudulent chargebacks. 
 

Paypal Ninja´s Secrets 
32 
 
Be sure to familiarize yourself with this policy; click the User Agreement link on 
the bottom of any page on the PayPal web site, and then click Seller Protection 
Policy.  
 
PayPal is able to guarantee protection against reversal of funds only if a 
chargeback occurs for nonreceipt of the product or in the event of an 
unauthorized charge (resulting from a stolen credit card or account takeover).  
 
Even then, you're entitled to this protection only if you have followed the terms 
of the Seller Protection Policy. Here are some best practices you should follow 
to prevent chargebacks from occurring: 
 
• Make sure the item you're selling is described (on your site or in your eBay 
listing) in as much detail and as accurately as possible. You should not assume 
that simply providing a picture in your listing will sufficiently answer any quality 
questions that your customers might have. Avoid merely stating that the 
merchandise is being sold "as-is." This won't protect you as much as you might 
expect. A detailed item description will help your defense in the event that a 
buyer claims that your item was not as described. 
 
• Get to know your customers. Although selling in an online environment doesn't 
make it easy to build a face-to-face rapport, it doesn't have to keep you from 
learning about your customers. While the volume of your business might 
prevent you from contacting all your buyers, you should make every effort to 
respond to any customer inquiries regarding the transaction or the purchased 
items, both before and after the transaction. Plus, this practice will help get you 
more repeat customers. 
 
• Keep any and all records and correspondence with your customers. This 
allows you to provide further evidence that you adequately described the item to 
the customer or responded to the customer's inquiries.

PAYPAL ALTERNATIVES 
 
While there are a lot of great services out there that would fit very well with 
eBay, eBay bans those services for your use.  
 
Therefore, if you want to use eBay WITHOUT using PayPal, you are limited in 
which services you can use to make and receive payments. 
 
PayPal Alternatives: For use on eBay 
Merchantinc.com -- Recommended for US Sellers Only 
Merchantinc.com Provides eBay Compatible credit card processing services for 
US residents only.  
The company has been in business for over 10 years and is a well-known 
provider of online payment processing solutions. After researching over 40 U.S. 
merchant account providers, we have Merchantinc.com because of their no 
setup/no cancellation fees approach. 
 
Their monthly fees for website processing, along with eBay processing, is only 
$7.95, a far better value than most companies we researched. Additionally, their 
transaction fees are LOWER than PayPal. Included with their services is an 
eBay compatible shopping cart system, Secure Payment Gateway and 
Merchant Account.  
  
The application process takes about 5 minutes, is completely online, and most 
people are ready to begin accepting credit cards the same day.  
 
I have stressed before, the benefits of using a traditional merchant account over 
PayPal, for many reasons, among them, your funds are deposited directly into 
your bank account, NOT a PAYPAL ACCOUNT!  
 
This gives you far more control of your money and your business. Plus, with a 
merchant account, your funds are protected by federal banking regulations 
"Since your merchant account is provided by a real US bank".  

Paypal Ninja´s Secrets 
34 
 
Unfortunately, PayPal is not considered a bank in the United States, and 
therefore it does not have to adhere to federal banking guidelines. 
 
PROS: Reliable, Secure Payment processing solution. Accepted on Ebay. No 
setup fees. No cancellation fees. Very low rates. Easy to setup. Perfect for use 
on websites as well.  
 
CONS: Only currently available for U.S. Merchants and Ebay sellers. 
 
OVERALL: Highly recommended as an alternative to PayPal and as an 
alternative to receiving online payments. This is one of my personal favorites. 
Sign up and take it for a test drive – you won't be sorry!

Allpay.net -- Recommended for U.K. Only 
This payment service is approved for use on all eBay sites around the world 
including the United States and Europe.  
 
This company is based in the United Kingdom. It has a rock solid reputation 
(even collecting payments for various local and state governments) and a 
customer service that is fast, efficient and caring. This should be a top PayPal 
alternative to residents and citizens of the United Kingdom for use on eBay and 
for general use as well.  
 
While it is  approved for us on eBay, the service is USELESS for residents of 
the United States and Canada. The service can be used in western Europe 
(Example: The Netherlands, Belgium, France, Germany)  
 
THE SERVICE: Allpay.net is an umbrella company providing many e-commerce 
solutions. Users must sign up for services INDIVIDUALLY.  
 
The services offered include Swipe card payments, direct debit, internet 
payments, mobile phone payments, general bill payments and their 
onlinepayment service Go&Pay. Go&Pay is what you would sign up for when 

Paypal Ninja´s Secrets 
35 
 
you want to accept payments on eBay, make a payment on eBay or a general 
online payment that is noneBay related. 
 
PROS: Backed by a respected and well managed company, merchants can 
accept cash or debit card payments online, gives merchant's customers more 
online payment options, works seamlessly with other payment options offered 
by the company, gives consumers the option of paying for online purchases 
with cash or debit cards, consumers can make online credit card payments, 
buyers and sellers are protected from fraud, and is easy to use. Reasonable 
fees are a major plus. 
 
CONS: Trying to figure out HOW to sign up can be confusing -- you really have 
to search. This system was not designed for use in major markets like the 
United States. They do not offer a FAQ on how to use their service. You have to 
learn or contact their customer service.  
 
OVERALL: Excellent e-commerce solution for those who want to buy and sell 
on eBay, make general online payments and be able to accept online payments 
for their business -- if you are resident of the United Kingdom. NOT 
recommended for users of the United States, Canada, Australia, etc. 
http://www.allpay.net 
 
CertaPay -- Recommended for CANADA Only 
This service is approved by eBay -- however, it would seem that only eBay 
Canada would be the place where this payment service could be used.  
 
All other markets are not available because this service is only for persons with 
Canadian bank accounts. This service is used to send money to an email 
account using money from your bank account.  
 
CertaPay is owned by Acxsys Corporation. They are a financially solid and 
reputable company.  
 

Paypal Ninja´s Secrets 
36 
 
THE SERVICE: A person can send money straight from their bank account to a 
person with an email account. To be able to send money, the user must have a 
Canadian bank account. To be able to receive money, the user must have an 
email address AND a Canadian bank account. 
 
The service can used to send money to friends and family, pay fees for 
services, make internet auction payments, make online payments to those who 
accept the service, and so on. 
 
PROS: Can send money person-to-person, accept auction payments, make 
online purchases including those at auctions, offer it as a web payment solution 
for your online business and be protected by the best seller protection policy I 
have ever seen: once you get your money, there is no way for CertaPay to take 
it back -- the only way to get the money back is for the seller to give it back. In 
the demo copy this site was able to use (thanks to corporate relations at 
CertaPay), the user interface was easy to use and the whole thing was up and 
running in 15 minutes. Customer service is friendly and responsive. Finding 
their telephone number and email address for customer support was a breeze. 
Emails are answered usually within one business day. Customer friendly user 
agreement with no frozen or limited account clauses. Plus it is free to receive 
money with this service. A business person would not have to worry about fees 
eating away at profits.  
 
CONS: This great service is ONLY AVAILABLE in Canada. It is not clear how 
much it costs to send money. Each bank that allows account holders to use this 
service charges different fees – that is a con for people wanted to send money. 
The service does not allow Canadians to send or receive money to an 
international audience -- not even Canada's neighbor, the United States. Buyers 
who use this service must beware as they will have no protection once they 
send money to a seller. Once the money is sent, there is no way to get the 
money back unless the seller agrees to a refund. 
 
OVERALL: Recommended for ALL Canadian residents. While this service 
offers a limited audience, a seller could make a good living with this or her 

Paypal Ninja´s Secrets 
37 
 
online business catering only to other Canadians. A buyer could benefit from 
this service by using it to pay for auctions and other online businesses located 
in Canada. As a bonus, this service can be used to send money person-to-
person. That makes sending money to friends and family really easy. It makes it 
easy to send money to anybody the user wants to do business with (again, as 
long as they have a Canadian bank account). 
http://www.interac.ca 
 
Nochex -- Recommended for U.K. Residents and Certain Others 
This is another service offered by a company based in the United Kingdom. 
This company leans towards being a merchant account, but also offers personal 
and seller accounts.  
 
Overall, they offer a way to be able to send payments as well as receive

Kingdom and around the world (credit cards, debit cards, etc). The sellers 
account allows you to receive payments only from within the U.K..  
 
The personal account is for sending and receiving money between persons 
(including auction transactions). However, the personal account comes with 
certain limits (such as you cannot receive more than 90 British Pounds per day 
or send more than 300 British Pounds per day).  
 
Residents of the United States, Canada, Australia, and Western Europe can 
sign up for the merchant account. You MUST BE a resident of the United

looking for fast. Reports can be generated and business statistics viewed. 
Withdrawing your money is easy and hassle free. Easy integration into your 
website or eBay auction.  
 
A bonus is each merchant account receives an assigned account manager. 
You'll speak with the same person every time should you have questions or 
concerns about your account. The personal account is also easy to use with no 
steep learning curve. Making online payments with the account is fast and 
trouble free.   
 
Funding the account is also simple. Customer service is easy to find through 
email, online forums, and over the phone. The application process is not 
complicated and you get an answer back within 48 hours. 
 
CONS: Some U.S. and Canadian users might be scared off because this is a 
British company. None of the services offers instant sign up -- you must apply 
for the account you are interested in. You can either be approved or denied. Not 
widely used outside of the United Kingdom.  
 
More U.S. and Canadian users would have to sign up for this service to make a 
dent in eBay. However, buyers from all over the world will still be able to click 
your Nochex payment button and pay you. 
 
OVERALL: If you are approved for the service, it is excellent. Persons from the 
United Kingdom should definitely be interested in this. Users from the United 
States and other countries would find the merchant account PERFECT for their 
needs. I like the merchant account I have, and would recommend it to almost 
anybody.
