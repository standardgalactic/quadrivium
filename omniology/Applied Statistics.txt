Preface
Preface
It is already encrypted on the American currency “IN GOD WE TRUST”. This was the first part of a 
statement that I heard from the Quality Manager at the Lubbock, TX, site of Texas Instrument while I 
was there (1992–1998) as a quality engineer and Statistical Process Control Trainer. The second part says 
“EVERYTHING ELSE NEEDS DATA”. It is the 21st century and the technology age, and data is abandunt 
in every way and field. Statistics is not an exception since it deals with data all, the time. How to make 
sense of that information was the motive behind writing this treatise on Applied Statistics.
Applied Statistics is a compendium, an elementary introduction to the growing field of statistics. In this 
consize volume we emphasize on the concepts, definitions and terminology. With no doubt in mind, 
linking the three building blocks, mentioned above, will provide any person with a strong hold on the 
subject of statistics.
The material had been presented in such a way that only College Algebra can be a prerequisite for the 
course that covers the whole text in one semester. The material is presented in 6 chapters.
Chapter 1 is about collecting, and organizing qualitative and quantitative data, as well as summarizing 
the data graphically or numericall regardless if the data were discrete or continuous.
Chapter 2 introduces the notion of probability, its axioms, its rules, and applications. In addition to 
that, Chapter 2 contains material on probability distributions and their characteristics for discrete and 
continuous cases.
Chapter 3 covers the first main part of inferential statistics; namely estimation in its two branches: point 
and interval estimation by introducing the sample statistics as estimators for the population parameters.
Chapter 4 is concerned about the second part of inferential statistics, namely hypothesis testing about 
one parameter of a population, or two parameters of two populations. In this chapter there is an outline, 
and procedure on how to implement the steps in hypothsis testing when using the two methods; the 
classical or the traditional method and the p-value method. The detailed exposure of the two methods will 
enable the reader, and the student to reach a comprehensive and sound conclusion by using information 
found in data.

Preface
Up till chapter 5, the discussions were with data based on one variable aspect of the population that 
of interest. Chapter 5 will introduce how to deal with two related variables and find a simple linear 
relationship, if it exists, between them. In other words, chapter 5 is restricted to simple linear regression 
between an explanatory variable and a response variable related to it. Moeover, the correlation concept 
and definition are introduced in order to measure the strength of that liear relationship which was found 
earlier.
Chapter 6 deals with another route of checking on data of one variable, or factor, and on the independence 
or dependence between two factors. Chapter 6 goes on to introduce other tests in statistics and to check 
on tests that make a decision whether more than two means are the same or not. Chapter 6 introduces 
the One-Way Analysis of Variance, or ANOVA.
The treatise is wrapped up with an appendix that has 8 tables for use when reading the textbook.

Introduction
The subject of statistics may be presented at various levels of mathematical difficulty, and it may be 
directed toward applications in various fields of inquiry. In this sequel we will keep the mathematical 
background to a minimal. Now the question: What is statistics can be raised.
Statistics is that branch of science which deals with: 
1.	 Collection of data,
2.	 Organizing and summarizing the data,
3.	 Analysis of data, and 
4.	 Making inferences, or decisions and predictions. 
Step 4 is the objective of statistics, i.e., making inferences about a population based on information 
contained in a representative sample taken from that population. 
We have some concepts that need to be well defined and established. These concepts are: A population 
is a set of objects called elements that share a certain property, and it is the entire group to be studied. 
For our purposes here, most populations will be sets of numbers that are of interest to us. For instance, 
if we talk about students, the population could be all the students you can think of.

Descriptive Statistics
EXAMPLE 1.1 
The students enrolled in any class at an institution form a population, since there are no more 
students that will have the same property. 
 
Since we cannot, and sometimes it is impossible to deal with all the elements in a population, a smaller 
and representative part, or a subset, of that population is considered. Thus that representing subset of 
the population is called a sample. 
EXAMPLE 1.2 
Consider the students in a particular class, and try to choose, at random a committee of three 
students. This committee is a sample of that population.
 
The elements in a population, or in a sample, are called observations, measurements, scores, or just data. 
Based on that, we have 4 levels of measurements. We define them below.
Levels of Measurements  Data may be classified in the following four levels of measurement.
•	 Nominal data consists of names, labels, or categories, gender, major at college. There is no 
natural or obvious ordering of nominal data. (Such as high to low). Arithmetic cannot be 
carried out on nominal data.
•	 Ordinal data can be arranged in any particular order. However, no arithmetic can be done 
or performed on ordinal data.
•	 Interval Data are similar to ordinal data, with the extra property that subtraction may be 
carried out on an interval data. There is no natural zero for interval data.
•	 Ratio data are similar to interval data, with the extra property that division may be carried 
out on ratio data. There exists a natural zero for ratio data.
EXAMPLE 1.3 
Identify which level of measurement is represented by the following data:
a)	 Years covered in American History: 1776–1876
b)	 Annual income of students in a Math/Statistics Class: $0–$10,000
c)	 ourse grades in any course: A, B, C, D, F, P , W, I
d)	 Student gender: male, female

Descriptive Statistics
Solution
a)	 The years 1776 to 1876 represent interval data. There is no natural zero (No “year zero”). 
Also division does not make any sense in terms of years. What is 1776/1876? So that data 
is not a ratio. However subtraction does make sense, the period covers: 1876–1776 = 100 
years.
b)	 Student income represents ratio data. Here division does make sense. That is, someone who 
made $4000 this year compared to what was made last year of $2000. Also, some student 
probably had no income last year, so that $0, the natural zero, makes sense.
c)	 Course-grades represent an ordinal data, since (i) they may be arranged in a particular 
order, and (ii) arithmetic cannot be done or performed on them. The quantity A–B makes 
no sense.
d)	 Student gender represents nominal data, since there is no natural or obvious way that the 
data may be ordered. Also no arithmetic can be done on students’ gender.
 
Data will be collected on individuals from the population and termed as variables. Thus variables are 
characteristics of the individuals within the population. Variables can take on various types of values, 
some of them are numbers and some are categories. For example, the number of doors in a house is 
10, and its area is 2975 square feet, each of which is numeric. On the other hand, this house is a single 
family house, which in essence has no numerical value to it. This leads us to classify variables into two 
groups: Qualitative and Quantitative.
A Qualitative or Categorical variable allows listing the individuals’ characteristics into categories. 
EXAMPLE 1.4 
The data in Example 1.3 above, in parts c. and d. are qualitative data.
 
A Quantitative variable is a variable that takes numerical measures upon which arithmetic operations 
can be carried out on the characteristics of the individuals. With no doubt, arithmetic operations can 
be carried out on quantitative variables, and thus providing meaningful results.
EXAMPLE 1.5 
 The data in Example 1.3, above, in parts a. and b. are quantitative data.

Descriptive Statistics
In addition to the above classification of data, and variables, as qualitative or quantitative; quantitative 
variables and data as well, can be further classified as: Discrete or Continuous.
A Discrete Variable is a quantitative variable that will assume a finite, or a countable, set of values. A 
discrete variable cannot take on every possible value in an interval on the real line. Each value can be 
plotted as a separate point on the real line, with space between any two consecutive points.
EXAMPLE 1.6 
a)	 The number of children that a family can have is a discrete variable.
b)	 The number of friends a student, in college, can have is a discrete variable.
 
A Continuous Variable is a quantitative variable that has an infinite number of values. In other words, a 
continuous variable can assume any value between any two points on the real line, and thus the possible 
values of a continuous variable can form an interval on the number line, with no spaces between the points. 
EXAMPLE 1.7 
The grade point average, GPA, of any student can take an infinite number of possible values, 
for example in the interval 0.0 to 4.0, hence GPA is a continuous variable.
 
In order to make the best decision, and get the most information from our data, certain measures for 
that purpose are needed. Thus we can think of Statistics as two branches: 
1.	 the descriptive statistics, and 
2.	 The inferential statistics. 
We will handle the concept of descriptive statistics in the next section, while leaving the inferential 
statistics for a later section.
1.2	
Descriptive Statistics
Once we have identified our population, and collected the sample data, our goal is to describe the 
characteristics of the sample in an accurate and unambiguous fashion in such a way that the information 
will be easily communicated to others. Describing, or just summarizing, the data can be done in two ways: 
1.	 Graphically or
2.	  Numerically.

Descriptive Statistics
Graphical description of the data depends on the data type. As we know, there are two types of data: 
Qualitative and Quantitative data. The graphs for describing a qualitative date include:
1.	 The Bar graph, 
2.	 The Pie Chart, and 
3.	 The Pareto Chart.
For describing a quantitative data graphically we use:
1.	 the Dot plot, 
2.	 The stem and leaf display, and 
3.	 The histogram.
In the subsequent sections we will discuss all those methods of presenting the data graphically.
1.3	
Frequency Distributions
When dealing with large sets of data, a good overall picture and sufficient information can be often 
conveyed by grouping the data into a number of classes. For instance, the weights of 125 mineral 
specimens collected on a field trip may be summarized as follows:

Table 1
Tables, like the one above, are called frequency distribution. If the data are grouped according to 
numerical size, as above, the resulting table is called a numerical or quantitative distribution. If the 
data are grouped in non-numerical categories, the resulting table is called a categorical or qualitative 
distribution. Frequency distributions present data in a relative compact form. They give a good overall 
picture, and contain information that is adequate for many purposes. Frequency distributions present 
raw data in a more readily usable form. 
The construction of frequency distributions consists of three steps, particularly for quantitative data:
1.	 Choosing the classes (intervals, or categories for qualitative data) 
2.	 Tally the data into these classes 
3.	 Count the number of items in each class. 
The first step is the most important step, while the others are purely mechanical and depend on step 1. 
Designing too few classes would obscure the information in the distribution while, on the other hand, 
designating too many classes would confuse the reader. Generally speaking, the common sense is the best 
guide here. Generally there are some formulas for determining the optimal number of classes, especially 
for quantitative data, like the following: If the number of classes is to be k, then
N  Q RU

N ORJQ 
where n is the sample size, and without any doubt, k will be rounded, down or up, to a whole number. 
Certain precautions need to be in place: 
1.	 Each item will go into one and only one class, 
2.	 The smallest and the largest values fall within the classification. 
3.	 None of the observations can fall into gaps between successive classes.
4.	 Successive classes do not overlap.

Whenever possible we make the classes the same width, that is, we make them cover equal ranges of 
values, (look up Table 1). To summarize what had been said, consider the following example.

We like to construct a frequency distribution for these data. Since no grade is less than 20, and no one 
greater than 100, the following classes are considered: 
Table 2
The numbers in the frequency column show how many items fall into each class, and they are called 
the frequency of those classes. The smallest and the largest values that can fall into any given class are 
called the class limits. These limits are given in column 1 under classes in Table 2. Thus the limits for 
the first class are 20 and 29, and as it is clear, 20 is the lower limit while 29 is the upper limit of the first 
class, and so on for the other classes. The classes’ boundaries for the data are: 19.5 – 29.5, 29.5 – 39.5, 
…, 89.5 – 99.5. These boundaries are carried to one more decimal place than the data is presented by 
in order not to have any point on the boundary between any two classes. The data dictate how many 
decimal places are needed to have separate classes, and no data point is shared between two classes.

Descriptive Statistics
Numerical distributions also have what we call class marks and class intervals. Class marks are simply 
the midpoints of the classes, and the class interval is the width, of the class. For our data above the class 
marks are: (20+29)/2 = 24.5, (30 + 39)/2 = 34.5, (90 + 99)/2 =94.5, and the class widths are: 29.5 – 19.5 
= 10, 39.5 – 29.5 = 10, 99.5 – 89.5 = 10, which is the same for all the classes. It is to be noted that the 
class interval is not given by the difference between the class limits but rather by the difference between 
the class boundaries.
There are two ways in which frequency distributions can be modified to suit particular needs. One way 
is to convert a distribution into a percentage distribution by dividing the frequency in each class by 
the total number of observations, and express it as a percentage, see column 4 in Table 2. This column 
has what we call the relative frequency column. The other way of modifying a frequency distribution is 
presenting it as a cumulative relative frequency distribution by adding the relative frequencies as we go 
down the classes, and this will generate the Ogive line, see Figure 5C.

Graphical Presentation of Quantitative Data
The most common form of graphical presentation of quantitative data is the histogram. An example of 
which is shown in Figure 1B, or Figure 2. There are some steps to be followed in order to construct a 
histogram. The steps are:
1.	 Identify the minimum and maximum in the data, and know how many data points there are 
on hand.
2.	 Calculate the difference between the max and the min of the data, and call it R, R = max – min.
3.	 Decide on the number of classes, k, needed for your histogram, usually by one of the 
formulas cited above. Make sure that k is an integer you can work with. The number of 
classes, k, will have the following range of values: 5 < k < 20 as its limits.
4.	 Calculate the class width, w, by w = R/k, and round it to a number that will not interfere 
with the data points as well as with the class limits and boundaries.
5.	 Choose the lower limit LL1 of the first class in order to accommodate for the minimum.
6.	 Find the upper class limit of the first class by adding w to LL1 to make the UL1, and at the 
same time it is LL2, and so on until you cover all the data. Be sure there are no data points 
on the boundaries of two classes. Data points have to be clearly identified by one and only 
one class.
7.	 Make a tally for the classes made above, by going over the data once.
8.	 Get the frequencies in each class, and check if all data points have been counted for.
9.	 Graph the histogram by using the horizontal axis for data classes and the vertical axis for 
class frequencies. The width of the classes is the same, and the height of each class will 
depend on the frequency in that class.
In general a histogram is a bar graph with no spaces between the bars, (Figure 1B). 
On the histogram, the top of each bar can be joined to the next bar top point by a broken line. This line 
will represent the frequency polygon, see Figure 2.
Figure 1A, below, shows the bar graph of the data in Example 1.8. Bar graphs are usually for Qualitative 
data. The display below is for showing the excel output. You can make that a histogram by eliminating 
the width between classes (Figure 1B).

Qualitative data can be summarized by using a bar graph, a pie chart, or a Pareto Chart. The classes 
here have no boundaries, and no limits. They are the categories that data had been given in, or 
classified based upon. Frequency, relative frequency, or cumulative relative frequency distributions can 
be done on qualitative data. For a complete histogram that is generated from Figure 1A, you can check

EXAMPLE 1.9 A typical histogram
Pulse rates, in beats per minute, were calculated for 192 students enrolled in a statistics course. The 
first step in creating a histogram is to create a frequency table, as shown in Table 3, and the histogram 
below, Figure 2. The broken lines joining the middle points on the tops of the bars will form what we 
call a polygon graph for the data. There are three cases to be taken into consideration when we look at 
the polygon.
1.	 The graph is skewed to the right,
2.	 The graph is skewed to the left, or
3.	 The graph is symmetric.
These cases will be looked at again after we present the numerical summary for the data.
In the table below, Table 3, the pulse rate is taken as an open – closed interval by the notation. In other 
words the interval (34–41] stands for the range of values 34 < Pulse Rate ≤ 41, and (41–48] is for the 
range of values given by 48 < Pulse rate ≤ 55, and so on.
Using the class frequencies (the number of observations in each class interval) shown in the frequency 
table, the following histogram Figure 2 was created.

In addition to the histogram for presenting the quantitative data graphically we have:
1.	 The Dot Plot
2.	 The Stem-and-Leaf.
We are not concerned much about the dot plot for quantitative data. Essentially it is the data line, drawn 
horizontally, with dots above the values once they are marked on the data line.
For the stem-and-leaf, it could be used as a graphical (or numerical) summary at the same time. It is 
highly related on how the data is presented. Is it all one digit, two digits, or 3 digits data? This setup 
determines how to make a stem-and-leaf diagram. There could be one stem, or split stem for the same data. 
EXAMPLE 1.10 
Consider the following data, in Table 4, and construct a stem-and-leaf for it.

Clearly, the data is of two digits, and varies between 11 and 48, and there are 40 data points. 
Based on this information, from the data, the stem will be the tens digit while the leaf will be 
the units digit. Thus we have the following stem-and-leaf diagram

Figure 3
Any stem-and-leaf diagram should be accompanied by a legend saying what the stem and leaf stand 
for. It is recommended to go over the data once, and put the leaf next to the stem, and then get another 
diagram with the leaf in order of magnitude. It is quite useful to have the frequency column, so you 
know you have not missed any data, see Figure 3.

In addition to the display, if you could turn the sheet 90 degrees, counter clockwise, and draw a bar 
along each stem, you get yourself a histogram. It is very visible that there are too many “leaf” on one 
stem. In this case we can split the stem in two parts, with the first part for 0–4, and the second part for 
the digits 5–9. Doing what just had been said we have the following diagram for the stem-and-leaf for 
the same data presented in EXAMPLE 1.10.

Graphical Presentation of Qualitative Data
As we have seen before, data can be qualitative or quantitative. It is to be recalled that qualitative data 
provide measures that categorize or classify an individual. When qualitative data is collected, we are 
interested in the number of items, or individuals, that fall within each category. Qualitative data can be 
summarized by using a 
1.	 Bar graph, 
2.	 A pie-chart, 
3.	 A Pareto chart. 
The classes here have no boundaries. They are the categories used to classify the data. Frequency, 
cumulative frequency, relative frequency distributions can be drawn to present the data graphically. A 
graph called the Ogive, a broken line joining the tops of the bars on the bar graph, which comes from 
the categories and their cumulative relative frequencies, can be made, see Figure 5C. The broken line 
joining the tops of the bars in a frequency distribution bar graph is called a frequency polygon. The broken 
line in Figure 2, above, is a frequency polygon for the data in Example 1.9. As it was with quantitative 
data a frequency distribution can be constructed which will list each category of data and the number 
of occurrences in the category.
EXAMPLE 1.11
Consider a class in Statistics 1350, of 50 students. How do we classify those students based on 
their major in college?
Solution:
No doubt those students in one course are not all have the same major, unless that class was a 
very specialized one. In Stat 1350, we find students majoring in Biology, Psychology, Elementary 
Education, Nursing, and social sciences. Those majors are categories and make the classes for 
our frequency distribution, as follows:

There is another way of describing the data in EXAMPLE 1.11, by depicting the relative frequency bar 
graph as shown in Figure 5B. It is to be noticed in Figure 5B, that you do not need to squeeze the bars 
to stand for percentages. The bars should clear enough to give a complete picture and information. In 
addition to the two graphs in Figure 5A and Figure 5B we can display the information in a pie chart

Figure 6 Pie Chart for the Majors in the Class
Figure 6 which is displaying a pie chart for the data in example 1.11, in general, can be used when the 
number of categories is between 5 and 10 inclusive. Beyond those limits, fewer than 5, the graph might 
hide some information from the data or exploit that information with too many classes.
So far we have displayed a bar graph, and a pie chart for qualitative data. What is that Pareto chart? 
A Pareto Chart is a bar graph whose bars are drawn in decreasing order of frequency or relative 
frequency. It is mainly a quality-tool for industry and business alike. It helps reduce the cost and increase 
the profit if used effectively.
Applying the definition of the Pareto chart on the data in Example 1.11, we will have the Pareto chart 
shown in Figure 7

As mentioned above this tool is a quality-tool and it can list the sources of scrap at a factory, so the 
quality engineer will know where is the major source for scrap and got on it. In another situation, a 
business manager can make a Pareto chart on the items sold most with high demand. He can get on 
that and make more money then.

Summation Notation 
The Greek Capital letter, Σ Sigma, is used to indicate summation of elements in a set or a sample or a 
population. It is usually indexed by an index to show how many elements are to be summed. The lower 
case Greek letter, σ sigma, is used for a quite different number in the statistics sequel, as we will see 
later. Let us consider an example.
EXAMPLE 1.12 
Consider the following set of numbers: 2, 5, 6, 7, 11, 15, 20, 22, and 23. Find the sum of the 
first 3 numbers.
Solution:
This set of numbers forms an array, since they are listed in order from the smallest to the 
largest. To sum the first three numbers we write


L
L
;
 ¦
 ;;;  
 
The expression i =1, below the summation sign, is called the lower limit of the summation, and the 
number 3, in this case, is called the upper limit. In general, in case we like to add all the numbers in the 
array, the order here does not matter. We can add them in any order they are given. There is no need 
to arrange them in an array.
Rules or Theorems on Summation
1.	 If all the values in an array are equal, the sum of their values equals the number of them 
times that constant value.

Numerical Methods for Summarizing Quantitative Data
As Described above, data can be one of two types: Qualitative (categorical) or Quantitative. In this 
section we will present some measure to summarize quantitative data. Those measures include:
1.	 Measures of Central Tendency (Measures of Center) 
2.	 Measures of Variation (Measures of Dispersion) 
3.	 Measures of Position, and
4.	 Measure of Quality and Outliers. 
1.6.1	
Measures of Central Tendency
At first we will deal with raw data as presented first time, i.e., not grouped in any way. Starting with the 
measures of Central tendency, there are 4 measures: 
1.	 The mean, or the arithmetic average, 
2.	 The mode, i.e., the most frequent observation(s), 
3.	 The median, and 
4.	 The mid-range. 
Let us give the definition for each of those measures.

1.	 The mean, or the arithmetic average, of a set of numbers is computed by adding all the 
values in the data set and divide by the number of observations. A point of warning is due 
here. Is the data set a sample or a population? To set the distinction between a population 
and a sample, we will reserve the number of observations in the sample to be n, while for a 
finite population that number will be denoted by N. Thus there is a difference in presenting 
the mean of the data if it were a sample or a population. For sample data the mean is 
denoted by x (pronounced “x-bar”), while the mean of a population data is denoted by μ 
(pronounced “mew”). For a sample data set given by

Descriptive Statistics
It is needless to say that we have to set a distinction between a population and a sample, when we 
calculate the mean. Any set of data should be considered as a sample until it is clearly specified that data 
is the whole population. Thus if a set of data is consisting of all conceivably possible (or hypothetically 
possible) observations of a given phenomenon, we call that set a population. If the data set consists of 
only a part of these observations, we call that set a sample.
Aside from the fact that the mean or the average, as frequently called and used, is a simple and familiar 
measure, the following are some of its noteworthy properties:
1.	 It can be calculated for any set of data, so it always exists.
2.	 A data set of numerical values has one and only one mean. Thus it is unique.
3.	 It lends itself to further statistical treatment, as we will see later.
4.	 It is relatively reliable in the sense that the means of many samples drawn from the same 
population usually do not fluctuate, or vary, as wildly as other statistical measures when 
used to estimate the mean of a population.
5.	 It takes into account every item of the data set.
6.	 It is very sensitive to any minor change in the data. 
In addition to the mean, or the arithmetic average, defined above, there are two other kinds of averages

and the harmonic mean. Based on the data, cited above, we can find those means as follows:

Consider the following set of data: 34, 15, 20, 7, 8, 9, 10, 22, 18, 30, 11, 12, and 19.
Solution: 
This same data can be looked at as a sample or as a population. In either case let us find the 
mean in each of those two cases. Clearly, we need to add all the data points in either case and 
divide by their number. Here n = 13, and N = 13, so we have x = 16.538, and μ = 16.538.

a)	 The geometric mean,

X3 =12, X4=15, and X5= 20. Applying the formula for, G we see that with a graphing 
calculator that G = (5*8*12*15*20)1/5= (144000)1/5 = 10.7565.

c)	 For the comparison, we need to calculate the arithmetic mean x. It is easily found that it 
equals to 60/5 = 12. Therefore we have H < G < x.
 
2.	 The Mode is the most frequent data point in the sample. The mode is considered to be the 
least informative measure in the central tendency measure. Generally speaking there are two 
cases where the mode is useful. First if the data represents frequency counts in a non-ordered 
or categorical classes (e.g. Hair color, Geographical data) it should be obvious that one can 
count the most frequent or popular class, while the mean and median cannot be computed. For 
Example, What meaning would a statement like “the average washing machine is a Maytag” 
have? Secondly, one may also cite the mode or modes of a distribution along with the mean and 
median. “While most people earn less than $50,000, the median income is $5000. There might 
be more than one mode. In case there is only one, the sample will be unimodal, or bimodal 
when it has two modes, or tri-modal when there are 3 modes, and so on.

Solution:
a)	 The data in Example 1.15 has no mode. Each data point has appeared once.
b)	 The data in b) above has what we call a modal class. It is that class with the highest 
frequency. The modal class is class 2.
 
3.	 The Median is that value, in an array of numerical data which separates the array into two 
equal parts; i.e., 50% above the median and 50% below the median. The definition of the 
median implies three steps before finding it. First we need to set the data in order, and it 
does not matter if the setting is done ascending or descending. Second, look up the value of 
n, the sample size. Third determine the observations in the middle of the array. Is n even, 
or is it odd? When n is an odd number, there is one middle value and it is at that point 
whose rank, in the array, equals (n+1)/2. Thus the median in this case is the [(n+1)/2]th 
observation. When n is even, there are two middle values in the array, namely [n/2]th and 
[n/2 +1]th observations. The median in this case is the average of those observations.

Solution:
Let us find the median for the data in Example 1.15. The number of data points is 13, an odd 
number. Thus, the median is the data point whose rank in the array is (13+1)/2 = 7. Let us 
arrange the data by an ascending order as: 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15, 18, 19, 20, 22, 30, and 34. We 
see that 15 is the seventh element in the array. Thus the median = 15.
 
4.	 The Mid-Range is another value that can be used to check on the center of any data. It 
is rarely used but it will give an indication when compared to the measures of central 
tendency. The Midrange is the average of the two extreme values in the data, i.e. the average 
of the maximum and the minimum in the array, i.e., Midrange = (Max + Min)/2.
EXAMPLE 1.19
What is the Mid-Range of the data in Example 1.15?
Solution:
Looking at the array in Example 1.15, we see that the minimum is 7 and the maximum is 34. 
Therefore the mid range is: MR = (7+34)/2 = 20.5.

1.6.2	
 The Measures of Variation
In section 1.6.1 we discussed the measures of central tendency, which they measure a typical value of 
the variable involved. We would like to know the amount of dispersion, or variation, in the variable. 
Dispersion is the degree to which the data are spread out. Individual differences or variations exist. This 
is not only a fact, but it is an interesting fact to all of us. The study of the variability among opinions, 
buying habits, learning abilities, mating behavior, profits, and so forth, occupies a great deal of scientific 
energy. In this section we initiate a discussion of variability with a presentation of the basic methods 
which numerically describe the variability in the observations of a sample and of a population.
Under our discussion of the measures of central tendency, we implicitly acknowledged that such variability 
exists or why else would we need to compute a single mean (or a median, or a mode) to summarize data? 
If the data points are all equal, then the first three measure of central tendency are equal.

Descriptive Statistics
In describing a set of data, a measure of central tendency alone does not really tell us enough to make many 
decisions or inferences. Several distributions can have the same mean yet the shape of the distribution 
of observations can be quite different. Thus to describe a set of data we typically use some measures of 
variation among the observations along with a measure of central tendency. As was true of the measures 
of central tendency, there are a number of measures of variation, and each is communicating or giving a 
different kind of information about the data. Our goal is to discuss the measures of dispersion in the data 
so we can quantify the spread of data. There are three numerical measures for describing the variation, 
or spread, or dispersion, in data. These measures are: 
1.	 The Range, 
2.	 The Variance, and 
3.	 The Standard Deviation.
The simplest measure of dispersion is the range. Thus, the Range, R, of a variable is the difference between 
the largest and the smallest values in the ordered data. That is,
Range = R = Largest data value – smallest data value
	 = Maximum – minimum.
EXAMPLE 1.20
What is the range for the data in Example 1.15?
Solution:
From the array in Example 1.15, we see that minimum = 7, and the maximum = 34. Therefore 
the range is given by R = 34 – 7= 27.
 
More specifically, for n observations which are ordered from the smallest Y1 to the largest Yn the range 
is: R = Yn – Y1. The range does not tell us how the observations are distributed between the smallest 
and the largest ones. The only information we really have from the range is the distance between the 
smallest and the largest measurements. As such, the range statistic is not a measure of dispersion of 
all the observations. It is a measure of the distance between the extremes in the data. Describing the 
distribution in terms of the range can be useful in cases of casual communications, e.g., “The grades on 
the first test were evenly distributed over a range of 30 points”. As it was with the measures of central 
tendency, we usually do not give the range statistic without qualifying it with other information, such 
as the measure of central tendency and the value of either the lowest and/or the highest observations.

The Variance and the Standard Deviation 
These are the most important concepts in a course on elementary statistics. Do not treat these concepts 
lightly because the rest of the course relies upon your understanding how to compute and use the 
variance and the standard deviation for a set of data. Some of the applications of these two concepts 
will be discussed below, but not all, since these measures of variability will be an integral part of every 
remaining chapter in this book. For a moment we talk about the population variance and standard 
deviation using the lower case Greek letter σ, sigma, where σ2 is the population variance, while σ is the 
standard deviation. It is needless to say that the relationship between the variance and the standard 
deviation is given by
Standard Deviation = the positive square root of the variance.

Descriptive Statistics
Our discussion Starts with the mean of the population μ, and how those observations are distributed 
around that value of μ. We are interested in the variability of the observations, in other words, we like to 
see what variation is there by calculating the variance and the standard deviation by using μ as a reference 
point. For any one observation Yi we can check how far that observation is from the mean μ, i.e. in the 
difference Yi – μ. This difference is called the deviation of the observation Yi from the mean μ. Based 
on the definition of the mean for a finite population, it is easily seen that “the sum of the deviations of 
all data points from the mean of the finite population” is zero. In case we a sample on our hands, the 
deviation from the mean of the sample X can be found as Yi – X. Moreover, based on the definition of 
the sample mean above, we can see that “The sum of the deviations of the sample data points from their 
mean is also zero”, (see exercise 1.8). 
We now turn to how to compute the variance and the standard deviation of a finite population. The 
population variance σ2 is defined as the average of all the squared deviations of the observations about 
their mean, i.e.

The formula for the variance, as defined above can be simplified and more accurate in case there was a 
rounding in calculating the mean, μ, of the data.
In case we have a sample of n points, the sample variance, S2, and the sample standard deviation, s, will

Descriptive Statistics
Solution: 
As described above we see that μ = (2+4+6+8+10)/5 = 6 = X, Thus we have  
σ2 = [(2-6)2 + (4-6)2 + (6-6)2 + (8-6)2 + (10-6)2]/5 = 8, and σ = 2
2  = 2.8284.
 
In case we considered the above data as a sample, we can see that x = 6, but there is a difference in 
calculating the variance and the standard deviation for a sample, as given by S2 = 10, instead of 8, since 
we divide by 4. Hence S = 10, and as it shows S is greater than σ.
NOTE 1: From the example above, you can find that the sum of the deviation around the mean of the 
population, or of the sample, is zero, i.e. [(2-6) + (4-6) + (6-6) + (8-6) + (10-6)] = 0.
Note 2: The above formulas for the variance and the standard deviation, whether we have a population 
or a sample, are by definition. Other computational formulas are available, and could be more accurate, 
especially if there were some rounding in finding the means for the population and the sample. These 
formulas for the population are as follows:

Note 3: Range Rule of Thumb for Understanding the variability in a distribution
The range rule of thumb is a crude but simple rule for understanding the spread in the data and interpreting 
the standard deviation. As it will be clear when we apply the empirical rule (See below Figure 3), the 
majority of the data (such as 95%) will be within 2 standard deviations from the mean of the data. Thus 
to roughly estimate the standard deviation, the rule of thumb states that

Some Properties of the Numerical Measures of Quantitative Data
1.	 If a constant is added to each data point, the mean of the new data will be the old mean plus 
that constant. Let Yi, i =1, 2,…, n be the original data, and Xi =Yi + b, where b is a constant. 
It is easily seen that X = Y + b. Similarly, the mode, and the median will be changed by 
adding the same constant to get the new ones. The mid range will not change.
2.	 If data were multiplied by a constant then the mean of the new data will be X = bY. Also in 
this case, the mode, the median and the mid-range will change. Each will be multiplied by 
that constant.
3.	 If a constant is added to each point, the variance will not change. Based on that, there will 
be no change in the standard deviation, See exercise 1.23. 
4.	 If each point in a data set is multiplied by a constant, then the variance will be multiplied by 
the square of that constant. The standard deviation will be multiplied by the absolute value 
of that constant. See Exercise 1.23.

5.	 In case the shape of the distribution for the data is roughly bell-shaped, the Empirical Rule 
states that:
The interval: (μ - σ , μ+σ) will contain approximately 68% of all the measurements
The interval: (μ - 2σ, μ+2σ) will contain approximately 95% of all the measurements 
The interval: (μ - 3σ, μ+ 3σ) will contain approximately 99.7% of all the measurements 
Recall that the Empirical Rule can be used in case we have a sample with the sample X mean 
replacing μ and the sample standard deviation s replacing σ in the above inequalities. We thus 
have the Figure 6, below.
6.	 Tchebyshev’s (Chebyshev’s) Inequality (pronounced Tcheb-e-shev’s): Given a constant k > 1, 
and regardless of the shape of the distribution, for any set of data, at least (1 – 1/k2) 100% of 
the observations will lie within k standard deviations of the mean, i.e., at least  
(1-1/k2)100% of the data will lie between μ - kσ and μ+ kσ. We can also use Tchebyshev’s 
Inequality based on a sample data.

Other Measures for Quantitative Data
In section 1.6 we discussed the measures of central tendency, the measures of variation, and some 
properties of those measures. In this section we discuss measures of position. These measures include: 
1.	 The z-score, 
2.	 The Percentiles, 
3.	 The Deciles, and 
4.	 The Quartiles.
The Z-score: It represents the distance that a data point is from the mean of all observations in terms of 
the number of standard deviations. As it can be seen, the Z-score is a ratio, and it is unit less, i.e. there 
are no units of measurement for the Z-score. There are two Z-scores, a Z-score for the population and 
another one for the sample. Their formulas are respectively given by 
Population Z- Score:

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

The Kth Percentile, denoted by Pk, of a set of data is a value such that k percent of the data are less than 
or equal to that value. Thus, the percentiles divide the array, the data set in order of magnitude, into 100 
parts; hence 99 percentiles can be determined. Percentiles are used to give the relative standing of an 
observation. Many standardized exams, such as the SAT, or ACT, college entrance exams use percentiles 
to provide students with understanding of how they scored in the exam in relation to the other students 
who participated in the same exam.

The deciles are parts of the percentiles that divide the data array into 10 parts, with each value presenting 
10% of the data less than or equal to that value. Clearly the fifth decile is the median and it is equal to 
P50, the 50th percentile.
The most common used percentiles are the Quartiles. Quartiles divide the array into fourths, or four 
equal parts. The second Quartile, Q2, is the median, and it divides the bottom 50% of the data from the 
top 50%. Thus it is the 50th percentile. Clearly it can be seen that the first Quartile, Q1, is the median 
of the lower half of the data, while the third quartile, Q3, is the median of the upper half of the data set.

Within the measures of dispersion we have introduced the range and the standard deviation, neither 
of which is resistant to extreme values. Quartiles, on the other hand, are resistant to extreme values. 
Because of this property, we can define a measure of dispersion that is based on quartiles, namely the 
Interquartile Range, IQR. The Interquartile Range, IQR, is the range of the middle 50% of the observations 
in the data set. That is, the IQR is the difference between the third quartile and the first quartile and it 
is found by the following formula
IQR = Q3 – Q1.
As it was the case with the range and standard deviation, the larger the IQR the more spread a data set has.

Descriptive Statistics
Whenever performing any type of data analysis, we should always check for extreme observations in the 
data set. Extreme observations are referred to as outliers. If outliers were encountered, their origin should 
be investigated. They can occur by chance, because of error in the measurement of a variable, during 
data entry, or from errors in sampling. We can use the following steps to check outliers using quartiles. 
For sure there might be outliers on either end of the data array, i.e. values are too small to be considered 
acceptable, or there are values that are too large to be taken as true values. Having calculated the IQR, 
then we determine the fences which serve as the cutoff points for determining outliers. Thus we have
Lower fence = Q1 – 1.5(IQR), 		
Upper fence = Q3 + 1.5 (IQR).
Any data value that is less than the lower fence, or greater than the upper fence, will be considered as 
an outlier.

Descriptive Statistics
In the previous sections we have presented the numerical measures for quantitative data. In those 
sections we have found that the median is resistant to extreme values and it is the preferred measure 
of central tendency when data is skewed right or left. Similarly, the IQR is also resistant to the extreme 
values. However, the median, Q1 and Q3 do not provide information about the extreme values in the 
data. To get this information, we need to know the smallest and largest values in the data set. Thus, we 
have what we call the five-number summary of a data set that consists of the smallest data value, Q1, the 
median, Q3, and the largest data value. The five-number summary can be used to make another graph, 
called the boxplot.
A reasonable question to ask at this time is “Why all the fuss about having different symbols distinguishing 
population and sample measures?” The answer is quite simple. Even with good sampling procedures the 
sample mean and the sample standard deviation will not necessarily be equal to the population mean 
and standard deviation respectively. In fact Y and S2 will be typically not equal to μ and σ2 respectively, 
even though we wish to make inferences about the characteristics of the population by using those of 
the sample. Our hope, of course, is to use computational procedures for the sample characteristics (e.g. 
Y and S2) which would provide good estimates for the population’s characteristics (μ and σ2).
Let us add two more definitions to your vocabulary.
A Parameter: is a characteristic of a population set of observations; e.g. N, μ, σ and σ2.
A Statistic: is a characteristic of a sample of observations, e.g., n, Y, S, and S2.

 Methods of Counting 
Counting plays an important role in many major fields, including probability. In this section, we will 
introduce special types of problems and develop general techniques for their solutions. We begin with 
The Multiplication Rule of Counting.
The Multiplication Rule of Counting
If a job consists of a sequence of choices to be done in which there are p selections for the first choice, q 
selections for the second choice, and r selections for the third choice, and so on, then the job of making 
these selections can be done in p. q. r……., different ways.
EXAMPLE: 1.22
A three member – committee from a class of 25 – students is to be randomly selected to serve 
as chair, vice-chair, and secretary. The first selected is the chair; the second is the Vice-chair; 
and the third is the secretary. How many different committee structures are possible?

Solution: 
There will be three selections. The first selection requires 25 choices. Because once the first 
student is chosen cannot be chosen again, we get left with 24 choices for the vice-chair. Similarly 
we have 23 choices for a secretary. Using the Multiplication Rule we found that there are 
25*24*23 = 13800 different committee structures.

It is of interest to the reader to know in how many ways we can arrange three books on a shelf in the 
library. It is well known that books in the libraries are put in order with respect to the subject matter of 
that book. Any misplacement of any book outside its place will be considered as a lost copy. Thus we see 
that 3 books can be put in order in 6 different ways, i.e., The first slot on the shelf can be filled out by 3 
different books, the second slot by two different books, and the third by one book, the one that was left. 
Hence the number of ways is 3! = 3.2.1 = 6. Hence we have the following definition.
A permutation is an arrangement of all, or part, of the objects in a set. Hence the number of permutations 
of n distinct objects is n! (n factorial). 
In case we like to arrange r distinct objects from n distinct ones we see that the number of ways is given by: 
nPr = n!/(n-r)!.
EXAMPLE 1.23
In how many ways can 4 boys and 5 girls sit in a row if the boys and girls must alternate?
Solution: 
There are 5! Ways for the girls to sit, while there are 4! ways for the boys to take their seats. 
Thus there are 5! . 4! = 2880
 
So far we considered permutations of distinct objects. That is, there are no two elements in the set that are 
alike. In the three books arrangement, if two of the books are the same text, denoted by a, b and c, then 
the arrangements of the six permutations of the letters a, b, c, where c = b = x, become axx, axx, xax, xax,  
xxa, and xxa, of which only three are distinct. Therefore with three letters, two being the same, we have 
3!/[(2!) (1!)] = 3 distinct permutations. Hence we have the following Rule:

In many problems we are interested in the number of ways of selecting r objects from n distinct objects 
without regard to order. These selections are called combinations. 
A combination is actually a partition of the objects in two cells, the one cell containing the r objects and 
the other cell containing the (n-r) object that are left. The number of such combinations is denoted, for

Description of Grouped Data
It is often that data is already summarized in a frequency table. When it is given in terms of classes’ 
limits and boundaries, it is difficult to retrieve the actual raw data. In such a case it is not easy to find 
an exact value for the mean or the standard deviation. Given the frequency table for the data, we will 
assume that within each class the mean of the data values, in that class, is equal to the class midpoint. 
We then multiply the class midpoint by the frequency of that class. This product is expected to be very 
close to the sum of the data that lie in that class. The process is repeated for all the classes, and the total 
will be calculated. This sum approximates the total of the data on hand. Thus based on this procedure 
we see that the means are given by

Again where Xi is the midpoint of the ith class, fi is the frequency in that class, and n is the number of

sample variances that might give more accurate values, in this case, than the above formulas. We are 
talking about the following

There is no doubt that by taking the square root of the above formulas we can get the standard deviations 
for either the population or the sample. To clarify all of the above, here is an example.

It can be seen, from the display above, that we need to do some work to get all the measures we are 
looking for. There is No mode, No range, No variance, No IQR, and No mid-range. There is something 
extra here, and that is σx, as if the data was looked at as population. That is the standard deviation of 
the assumed population. Thus 
S2 = (14.90214339)2 = 222.0738776
σ2 = (14.7523693)2 = 217.6324
No doubt that Sx > σx, since the denominator in finding those values was n-1 and n respectively.

It shows that there is an outlier on the lower end. The outlier is the data point 29, the minX in the data.

Introduction
Knowledge of the properties of theoretical probability distributions is an important part of the decision 
making process in the various areas of the applied and basic sciences.
Let us look at an example in an applied area. A certain change in the technique of producing tranquilizer 
pills is predicted to decrease the average number of defective units per lot of 1,000 tranquilizers. In order 
to check out, or test, this prediction we need to know the expected number of defective units per lot, 
and the expected variability of defective units per day, under the present technique of production, in 
order to compare them with their companions under the New technique.
To make such a comparison, a number of samples are taken under both production techniques. Suppose 
that the quality control engineer charged with this investigation find the following for the number of 
defectives:

Random Variables and Probability Distributions
The visual inspection, of the descriptive statistics, suggests that the new technique is better, but the results 
are not really clear cut. While the mean and variance of the number of defectives, in the two samples, 
showed the predicted decrease, there was a certain amount of overlap in the two sample distributions. 
The new technique may not have had been a chance of occurrence, and that , if repeated sampling were 
performed, the direction of the difference observed in the first sampling might only occur half of the time.
Again, we raise the question: What might occur in the long run, i.e. over repeated sampling? Furthermore, 
we need some rules in order to make a final decision as whether the new production method is better or not 
than the old one. An approach which is commonly used is to describe the characteristics of a distribution 
of possible outcomes which assumes that no difference (between the two methods) exists. This distribution 
is often called the Null (no difference) distribution. The Null distribution is developed as a probability 
distribution which states the probability of obtaining every possible outcome of sampling assuming no 
difference. If such a distribution is known, we could then state the probability of obtaining our particular 
sample if it were selected from the parent population which generated the null probability distribution. If 
our sample is a highly improbable outcome, given the null probability distribution, then we might conclude 
that the sample was drawn from some distribution other than the null distribution. In short, you would 
conclude that the new method very likely produces results different from the old method.

Random Variables and Probability Distributions
To make a decision like the one described above, we need to know the nature of the theoretical probability 
distribution which describes the probability of each possible event. The next two sections discuss the 
basic rationale and characteristics of two very common probability distributions: The Binomial and 
the normal probability distributions. Before initiating these discussions, we need to review some basic 
definitions and concepts of probability theory and random variables. What follows is a summary of the 
probability concepts and basic notion on set theory. We recommend that you start this summary as if 
you were seeing the material for the first time, and you need a lot of memorization.
2.2	
Probability
We start this section with some definitions.
An Experiment is a process by which an observation (or a measurement) is obtained.
A sample Space, S, for an experiment, is the set of all possible outcomes of that experiment.
EXAMPLE 2.1: 
Determine the sample space of the following experiments:
1.	 Tossing a normal coin is an experiment. 
2.	 Taking a test, as a student in any course, is an experiment. 
Solution:
1.	 The Sample Space, S, is given by S = {Head, Tail} = {H, T}
2.	 The sample space, S, consists of the following grades, S = {A, B, C, D, F}.
An event is any collection of outcomes from, or a subset of, the sample space of a probability experiment. 
Events that contain one outcome are called simple events, while those with more than one outcome are 
called compound events. In general, events are denoted using capital letters such as E. 
EXAMPLE 2.2:
A probability experiment consists of rolling a single fair die.
1.	 Identify the outcomes of this experiment.
2.	 Determine the sample space.
3.	 Define the event E = “roll an even number.”

Random Variables and Probability Distributions
Solution:
1.	 The outcomes from rolling a single fair die are x1 = “rolling a one” = {1}, x2 = “rolling a two” 
= {2}, x3 =“rolling a three” = {3}, x4 =“rolling a four” = {4}, x5 =“rolling a five” = {5}, and 
x6 = “rolling a six” = {6}.
2.	 The sample space, S, has six outcomes, as it appeared from part 1. Thus S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.
3.	 The event E = “roll an even number” = {2, 4, 6}.
 
EXAMPLE 2.3: 
1.	 In tossing a fair normal coin, in example 2.1, identify the simple events.
2.	 In rolling a fair die, in Example 2.2, identify the compound event.
Solution:
1.	 The sample space here is the set S = {H, T}. Each outcome is a simple one. It cannot be 
broken any further.
2.	 The event E = “roll an even number” is a compound event. 
 
The Probability of an outcome, in a sample space, is that chance or relative frequency, or the mathematical 
measure of the likelihood for that outcome (given a particular experiment) to occur. If a sample space, 
of an experiment, consists of the following n sample points: 
1
2
,
,...,
n
x x
x  then we can assign the number 
ip for the probability of the outcome
ix , and we write P (
ix ) =
ip , on the condition that 
1.	 The probability of an event E, P(E), must be greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal 
to 1, 0 ≤ P(E) ≤ 1, or by the above notation we have 0 ≤
ip ≤ 1,
2.	 The sum of the probabilities of all the outcomes, in a probability experiment must be equal 
to 1. That is if the sample space S is given as S = {
1
2
,
,...,
n
x x
x }, then P(S) = 
1
n
ip
∑
= 1.
A Probability Model lists the possible outcomes of the experiment and the associated probability of each 
outcome displayed in a table, by a graph, or by a formula. The probabilities, in any probability model, 
should satisfy the above two conditions.

Random Variables and Probability Distributions
As it was shown above, if E is an event, then the probability that E has occurred is the sum of the 
probabilities of the simple sample points that make the event. Hence if E = {Y1, Y2, …, Yn}, then 
p(E) = p(y1) + P(y2) + … + P(yn). The void, or the null, or the empty, set is an event with no sample 
points in it. The empty set is a subset of every set even of itself. The symbol for an empty set is the Greek 
letter ϕ, (Phi).
If an event is impossible, (does not occur), the probability of the event is 0. If an event is a certainty, 
then its probability should be 1. By our setting, we see that P (ϕ) = 0, and P(S) = 1. The sample space is 
a certainty. Any outcome will be there in S, and S, as an event, is always occurring.
2.2.1	
Types of Probability 
From the definition of probability, we see that it deals with the long-term proportions with which a 
particular outcome will occur. Based on that, how can we determine probabilities of outcomes? For this 
purpose, we have the following types of probabilities:
1.	 Empirical Probability: It is that probability of an event E which can be approximated by 
the ratio of the number of times it occurred to the number of times that the experiment has 
been carried out. Thus
P (E) ≈ Relative Frequency of E =
frequencyof E
number of trials made

Random Variables and Probability Distributions
The probability obtained using the empirical approach is an approximate value for p (E). If the experiment 
is repeated more or less times the relative frequency will change
2.	 Classical Probability: If an experiment has n equally likely outcomes and if the number of 
ways of an event, E, to occur is m, then 
P (E) = 
exp
Number of waysthat E occurs
number of possibleoutcomesinthe
eriment
= m
n
.
When computing probabilities by the classical method, the experiment is not needed to be actually 
performed. Applying the classical method for calculating probabilities requires that all the outcomes 
are equally likely to occur
3.	 Subjective Probability: It is a probability obtained on the basis of personal judgment.
It is to be realized that using the subjective probabilities are completely acceptable and legitimate, and 
possibly the only method of assigning likelihood to an outcome.

Operations and Probability calculation on Events
Let A and B be two events defined on the sample space S, or Ω.
The union of the two events, or sets, written A  B, is defined to be the set 
A  B = {x| x ∈A or x∈B}, 
Figure 1
where x ∈ B means that x is an element of B, or x belongs to the set B. The shaded area in Figure 1 
represents the union of the two sets A and B. In other words the union of two sets is the collection of 
all the elements in the two sets without repeating the common elements between the two sets.

The intersection of two events, or sets, written as A  B, is defined to be the set 
A  B = {x | x ∈ A and x ∈ B}. 
Figure 2
Thus the intersection of two sets is the set of all the elements that are common between the two given sets. 
In case the intersection of the two sets is void, or the empty set, as shown in Figure 3 then the two sets 
are disjoint, or mutually exclusive. 
Figure 3
For any two disjoint sets A and B, we have the Addition Rule, (think of the probability as the ratio of the 
area in the event to the area in the sample space, See Figure 3 when A and B have nothing in common) 
then
P (A or B) = P (A) + P (B). 
The general addition Rule states thate
P (A or B) = P (A) + P (B) – P (A and B) = P (A) + P (B) – P (A  B).

Applying the same concept, as before, you see that the part between A and B has been taken into 
consideration twice, hence it is needed to take it out once. 
The complement of a set A, written A (or A’, or Ac), is defined to be, check Figure 4 below
A = {x| x ∉ A}, 
where x ∉ A means that x does not belong to A, x is not an element of the set A. In other words  
x ∉ A is the negation of x ∈ A.

The complement Rule: For any set, or event, E since E  E’ = S, and EE’=ϕ, then
P (E’) = 1 – P (E).
This is based on P(S) = 1, with the Addition rule we have 1 = P(S) = P (E or E’) = P (E) + P (E’).

Subsets introduce the notion of membership or contained, when one set is contained, or contains, another 
set. If every element of a set A is an element of another set B, then A is a subset of B, which is written as 
A  B.
When A is a subset of B, and B is a subset of A then A = B. 
A  B and B  C, then A = B

Solution:
Thus we can see that 
1.	 AB = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}. Hence P (AB) = 9/12 =0.75
2.	 AB = {3, 4, 5, 6}, And P (AB) = 4/12=1/3.
3.	 EF = {6, 12}, with P (EF) = 2/12 = 1/6.
4.	 While E’ = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11}, we have P (E’) = 0.5.
5.	 P (FG) = P (F) + P (G) – P (FG) = 4/12 + 3/12 – 0/12 = 7/12.

We have already introduced the rules for some probability calculations, when we gave the definitions for 
the types of probabilities. Now we introduce some more rules for computing probabilities. It should not 
be a surprise if we say, in addition to the General Addition rule, there are: Multiplication and Quotient 
rules. Really, you believe that? Let us find out. 
The addition rule above, as it has been seen, is involved with finding the probability of E or F. The 
emphasis here is on “or”, i.e. when one or the other will occur. Each probability rule is related to some 
kind of events. The addition rule is involved with disjoint or if one will occur than the other. Before 
introducing the product rule, let us define what is meant by independent events.
Two events A and B are independent if the occurrence of either one of them does not affect the 
occurrence of the other in a probability experiment. Thus two events are termed dependent if the 
occurrence of one, in a probability experiment, affects the occurrence of the other. If you toss a fair 
coin twice, clearly the outcome on the first toss has nothing to do with the outcome on the second 
toss. Moreover roll a die and you get a 1, has nothing to do with the outcome of the next roll. Recall 
the sample space of flipping a fair coin twice which consists of S = {HH, HT, TH, TT}, we find that the 
probability of 2 heads, i.e. P {(HH)} = ¼, one out of four in the sample space. Remember also, we are 
tossing a fair coin in such a way that P ({H}) = ½, and ½*1/2 = ¼ that implies P ({HH}) = P ({H})*P 
({H}), and hence the product rule:
The product Rule of probabilities: Two events E and F are independent if and only if 
P(E and F) = P(E).P(F)
The above rule can be generalized to more than two events. In the above rule, if neither E nor F is the 
impossible event, Then E and F cannot be mutually exclusive.

For finding the “quotient” or the general product rule, let us ask the question for a student: What is the 
chance of passing this class, with a high grade, if you do not study? Or, if you study what is the chance 
you pass this course, with a high grade? No doubt one event is “conditioned “on the other to occur. If 
it is not cloudy, at some time, the chance of rain, at that time is much smaller than when it is cloudy.
The symbol P (E|F), read as the probability of E given F. It is the probability that event E will occur 
provided F has occurred already. We conclude with this “quotient” rule:
If A and B are any two events, then

P Aand B
P B
P A B =
, OR 
(
)
( )
(
|
)
P Aand B
P A
P B A =
,
Since (A and B) is the same as (B and A). In the above two versions for the rule, we should have P(A) ≠ 0, 
and P(B) ≠ 0. This is so, since the event has occurred already. It is NOT the impossible event. Hence 
the general products rule:

Random Variables
The Random Experiment and its Sample Space: A random experiment is any process of measurement 
or observation, in which the outcome cannot be completely determined in advance. The Sample Space, S, 
of any random experiment is the total collection of all possible outcomes of the random experiment. Each 
outcome has a certain probability (chance) to occur. Thus tossing a coin once is a random experiment, 
and the sample space of which is {Head, Tail}. Observing the value of a certain stock in the market is 
a random experiment, the sample space of which is the set of all possible values of the stock may take. 
Analyzing a certain chemical to determine the iron content is also a random experiment, Moreover, 
measuring the height or weight of an object is again a random experiment.
Random Variable: A random variable is any real-valued quantity, or numerical measure, whose value 
depends on the outcomes of a random experiment. Random variables are typically denoted, or identified, 
by capital letters such as X. The values that a random variable will take will be denoted by lower case 
letter x, Thus, in tossing a coin once, the number of heads, X, that may appear is a random variable 
which may take the values x = 0 or x = 1. In observing a certain stock in the market, the value X of the 
stock is a random variable which may take any value between $1 and $10, i.e. 1 ≤ x ≤ 10. In measuring 
the weight of a person, the weight X is a random variable which may take any value between 105.45 and 
300.15 lbs, say, i.e., 105.45 ≤ x ≤ 300.15. Based on what had been explained, we see that there are two 
types of random variables. So, in what is coming next, we like to introduce those types.
A Discrete Random Variable: is that random variable which has either a finite or countable number of 
values. The values of a discrete Random variable can be plotted on the number line with spaces between 
them. For example; the number of cousins you have, or the number of friends you know.
A Continuous Random Variable: is that variable which has an infinitely many values. The values of 
a continuous random variable can be plotted on a line in an uninterrupted fashion. For example, the 
distance you drive to work or to school every day.
Any random variable will take a certain values with a certain probability. The function that controls 
these probabilities is called the Probability Mass Function, or pmf, in the discrete case. It is called the 
Probability Density Function in the continuous case, or pdf. In the discrete case the value of the pmf 
at a certain value of the random variable will give the probability that the random variable will take 
such a value, for example f(x) = P(X = x)= p(x). On the other hand, the value of the pdf at a certain 
value of the random variable will give a point on the graph of the pdf for that variable. For finding the 
probability in the continuous case, we find that area under the curve of the pdf between two points on 
the range of the random variable. In addition to the pmf and pdf there is another important concept, or 
function, called the Cumulative Distribution Function, or cdf. The cdf is defined all over the real line 
regardless whether the variable is discrete or continuous, and it is given by:
F (k) = P(X ≤ k) =
( )

, in the continuous case. 
In case the student is not yet familiar with integration, there should be no worry, since we are not going 
to use that notion very much in this text at this level. The cdf and the pmf of a random variable are 
related as shown above. 
A probability Model, or a probability distribution, is a table, in the case of a discrete random variable, that 
depicts the values of the random variable and their associated probabilities. In the case of a continuous 
random variable, the probability model is a formula that gives the probability of that random variable 
over a defined set of values on the real line. 
EXAMPLE 2.5:
Consider the experiment for counting the number of heads in tossing a fair coin twice. 
Solution:
Thus the sample space has the following outcomes: HH, HT, TH, TT. Counting the heads in 
each outcome we find that our discrete random variable takes the values x = 0, 1, 2. Hence we 
have the following discrete probability distribution
x

1

p(x)
0.25
0.50

It is seen that in a probability distribution, the associated probabilities are satisfying the 
conditions above for each being non-negative and add up to one.

Expected Value and Variance of a Random Variable
Given a set of measurements, we sometimes are interested in the average of the data, and in how 
much variation there is. For example, the average income and the variation in the incomes of a group 
of employees at a certain university, the average of a set of measurements on the content of iron in a 
substance, and the variability in the readings of some apparatus.
In statistics, the concept of “average” is referred to as the expected value, or the mean value of the 
random variable. The concept of variation is referred to as the variance, or the standard deviation of a 
random variable.

It is clearly seen that the variance is the average of the squared deviations of the values of X from their 
mean μx. The variance is a quantity that reflects the extent to which the random variable is close to its 
mean. However, the variance, as it could be checked, is expressed in square units of the measurements. 
Based on that, it looks as if it is needed to express the variation in terms of the units that the data are 
measured in. Thus we have the definition of the standard deviation, denoted by σx, as the positive square 
root of the variance, i.e. 
The Standard Deviation of a random variable = σx = +

Some Discrete Probability Distributions
As it was shown above, there are two types of random variables, and thus there are two types of probability 
distributions; namely the discrete and continuous probability distributions. Probability distributions in 
statistics are used as models which are simplified versions of some real life phenomena. In the discrete 
case, there are five probability distributions that are quite referred to very often. Those distributions 
are: The Binomial, The Poisson, and The Geometric, The Hyper Geometric, and The Negative Binomial 
distributions. We start with the Binomial distribution.
2.6.1	
Binomial Probability Distribution
A Bernoulli trial is that experiment that has only two outcomes. Those two outcomes are mutually 
exclusive, i.e. cannot happen at the same time, and they are labeled as S, for a success, or F, for a failure, 
with constant probability of success as p, i.e. P(S) = p, and that of a failure as q, or P (F) = q, with  
p + q = 1. Such an experiment is said to have a Binomial Probability Distribution if the following 
conditions are satisfied;
1.	 There is a fixed number, n, of Bernoulli independent trials. This means that the outcome of 
one trial will not affect the outcomes of the other trials.
2.	 The probability of success is constant throughout the experiment, as well as that of a failure, 
based on p + q = 1.
3.	 We are interested in the number of successes, X, as a result of those n Bernoulli trials, 
regardless how they will occur. Hence we see that X will take the values of x = 0, 1, 2, …,n.
4.	 The probability of obtaining X successes, in those n independent Bernoulli trials, is given by 
the following pmf
P(X = x) = P(x) = nCx px(1 – p)n - x = n
x



px(1 – p)n - x, x = 0, 1, 2, …,n. 
With nCx denoting the number of combinations of x items taken from n distinct items without paying 
attention to order, or it can be set like 
n
x



, and p is the probability of success.
The Values for the above pmf, based on different values for n and p, are tabulated as a cdf values in 
Table II, in the Appendix. 
EXAMPLE 2.8: 
From clinical trials, it is known that 20% of mice inoculated with a serum will not develop 
protection against a certain disease. If 10 mice were inoculated, find
a)	 The probability of at most 3 mice will contract the disease.
b)	 The probability that exactly 5 mice will contract the disease.

binomial distribution with n = 10 and p = 0.2. Thus we have 
a)	 P(X ≤ 3) = F (3) = 0.8791, from the Table, with n = 10, p = 0.2, and x =3.
b)	 P(X = 5) = P (5) = P(X ≤ 5) – P(X ≤ 4) = 0.9936 – 0.9672 = 0.0264.

Mean and Variance for a Binomial Random Variable
We discussed finding the mean (or expected value) and standard deviation of a discrete random variable 
in Section 2.4. Those formulas can be used to find the mean (or expected value) and standard deviation 
for the binomial random variable as well. 
A binomial experiment with n independent Bernoulli trials and probability of success p has a mean and 
standard deviation given by the formulas:

According to the Federal Communications Commission, 75% of all U.S. Households have cable 
television in 2004. In a simple random sample of 300 households, determine the mean and 
standard deviation for the number of households that will have cable television. 
Solution:
This is a binomial experiment since the conditions set above are satisfied. So, in this case we 
have n = 300, and p = 0.75. We can use the formulas for the mean and the standard deviation

Constructing a binomial probability histogram is no different from constructing other probability 
histograms. The values of the random variable X will be, definitely, the classes, and the probabilities 
of those values, as we listed them as relative frequencies, are the heights of the bars in the histogram. 
EXAMPLE 2.10:
Given the following binomial probability distributions, construct a probability histogram for 
each case.
a)	 n = 10, and p = 0.2
b)	 n = 10, and p = 0.5
c)	 n = 10, and p = 0.8

To construct the binomial histogram, sure we need to have the classes defined and the associated 
probabilities calculated for each value. No doubt that the values that the random variable will 
take in each of the case above are: x = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10. Based on these values 
and the associated probabilities with them we have the following tables:

Remark 1: It is to be noted that the probabilities in Part a) and part c) in the tables are reversed, and 
that is expected. This is true since calculating the probability of 6 successes equals the probability of 
calculating 4 failures, when p and q have been interchanged. 
Remark 2: For part b) the probabilities are symmetric about the center value of 5, since p = 0.5, check 
the table for this part.
The graphs below show the binomial histograms for the data in a), b) and c) respectively with the

Random Variables and Probability Distributions
Using the results in Example 2.10, we have the tendency to conclude that the binomial probability 
distribution is skewed to the right if p < 0.5, symmetric and approximately bell-shaped if p = 0.5, and 
skewed to the left if p > 0.5, with n being held constant for those variable values of p, the probability of 
success in a Bernoulli trial.
The binomial probability distribution depends on two parameters, namely the number of trials, n, in 
the binomial experiment and the probability of success, p. Holding n constant, we have seen how the 
changes in the p value affect the shape of the distribution, and determine which side is skewed to. Now, 
what will happen if we kept p constant, and let n varies? In other words, what role does n play in the 
shape of the distribution? To answer this question we compare the following sets of distributions for the 
fixed value of p = 0.2, and n = 10, 30, and 70.
For the case n = 10 and p = 0.2, we will have figure 6A. For n = 30, and p = 0.2 (by using technology to 
graph the binomial histogram we can see that the graph is slightly skewed to the right, while for n = 70, 
and p = 0.2, we will have what appears to be a bell shaped histogram. We can come to this conclusion: 
As the number of trials, n, in a binomial experiment, increases, and the histogram for the probability 
distribution of the random variable X becomes approximately bell-shaped. As a rule of thumb, if np  
(1-p) ≥10, the probability distribution for a binomial random variable will be approximately bell-shaped.
2.6.2	
Poisson Distribution
Consider a sequence of random events such as: radioactive disintegration during a unit time interval, 
incoming g calls at a telephone switchboard during lunch hour, the number of traffic accidents at a 
certain intersection during a week, the number of massages you sent to friends per week, and the 
number of misprints per page in a book. All of the above events display a counting measure, X, of a 
random phenomena over a continuous medium, and this counts to define a Poisson distribution. This 
distribution has the following pmf,
P(X = x) = p(x) = 
/ !,
x
x
e
x
l
−
    x = 0, 1, 2, …
= zero, otherwise.
The constant, λ> 0, represents the average number (or the density of events) per one unit of measurement 
(unit of time, unit of length, or unit of area, or unit of volume). Table III has the probabilities for the 
Poisson distribution. 
(It can be easily shown, if the student is familiar with calculus, that the above p(x) satisfies the conditions 
for a pmf) 
Moreover, applying the formulas for the mean and the variance of a discrete random variable, it is easily 
verified that the mean and the variance, in this case, are equal, and each is equal to λ, (See something 
EXTRA below).

EXAMPLE 2.9:
Consider the number of accidents between 8 and 9 am on an intersection on Saturday. From 
data recorded let the mean of accidents on that intersection have a mean of 4. Hence this follows 
what we call a Poisson distribution with λ = 4. Find the probability that on a given Saturday, 
between 8 and 9 am, there will be:
a)	 No accident,
b)	 At least one accident,
c)	 Exactly 4 accidents. 
Solution: 
a)	 From Table III, we have, with λ = 4 and x = 0, and using the above formula for p(x) that 
gives the value p (0) = 0.018.
b)	 P (at least 1 accident) = P (X ≥ 1) = 1 – P(X < 1) = 1 – P(X ≤ 0) = 1 – P(X = 0) = 1– 0.018 = 
0.982.
c)	 P(X = 4) =

Geometric Distributions
Let us consider an experiment in which the conditions are like those for a binomial one. In other 
words, let us have an experiment where there are two outcomes only, namely success and failure, with 
P (success) = p, and that of a failure P (F) = q, with p + q = 1. We are interested in the number, X, of 
trials needed to get the first success, with clear understanding that the trials are independent. Based on 
these assumptions, we see that the following function is a pmf for a discrete probability distribution 
called a geometric distribution;

In a certain producing process it is known that, on the average, 1 in every 100 items is defective. 
What is the probability that the fifth item inspected is the first defective item found?
Solution: 
Using the above formula for the Geometric distribution with x = 5 and p = 0.01, we have  
P (5) = (0.01) (0.99)4 = 0.0096

EXAMPLE 2.11: 
During the busy time of the day, a telephone exchange is near capacity, so people cannot find 
a line to use. It may be of interest to know the number of attempts necessary in order to gain 
a connection. Suppose that we let p = 0.05 be the probability of a connection during the busy 
time period. We are interested in knowing the probability that 5 attempts are needed for a 
successful call.
Solution: 
As above, by using the formula for the geometric distribution with x = 5 and p = 0.05 we find 
that P (5) = (0.05) (0.95)4 = 0.041
 
Theorem: Due to their importance and use, the mean and variance of a random variable, following the 
geometric distribution, are given by:
μ = 1/p and 	σ2 = (1 – p)/p.
Again the proof is left to the interested reader who is already equipped with some calculus.
2.6.4	
Hyper geometric Distribution
There is a distinct difference in sampling for the binomial and hyper geometric distributions. In the 
binomial case, the sampling is done with replacement in order to keep the probability of a success as a 
constant throughout the experiment. On the other hand the sampling for the hyper geometric is done 
without replacement, and thus the repeated trials are not independent. This kind of sampling will affect 
the probability of a success.
Applications for the hyper geometric distribution are found in many areas and fields, with heavy uses in 
acceptance sampling, electronic testing, and quality assurance, as examples. Clearly, in these instances 
the item chosen is destroyed and cannot be put back in the sample. For the hyper geometric experiment 
we consider a finite population of size N, which is composed of two categories, good and defective, for 
instance, with the number of good items denoted by R, and thus the number N – R, of the remaining 
items, will make the number of defectives. In general, we are interested in the number of successes, 
X, selected from those R items and with n – x failures selected from N – R, with n being our sample 
size selected from the population of size N. This is known as hyper geometric experiment that has the 
following two properties:
1.	 A random sample of size n is selected without replacement from N distinct items.
2.	 R of the N items are classified as successes and N – R are classified as failures.

Checking the above formula, we find that it is based on the multiplication rule of finding the number of 
ways of doing things when we have more than one option. That number clearly appears in the numerator 
and denominator of the above formula, respectively. Hence, the probability is the ratio of those two 
numbers based on the definition of the classical probability Rule.

Negative Binomial Distribution
As it was the case with the Binomial distribution, we are appealing to the Bernoulli trial, that is famous for 
its two only outcomes, a success with probability p, and a failure with probability q = 1- p. Our interest, 
in this case, lies in the number of trials, X, as our Negative Binomial random variable, to produce r 
successes. The pmf for X is called the negative Binomial distribution. If we are very lucky, we can get r 
successes in the first r trials, and that suggests that the number of trials needed, to get r successes, is at 
least r. Once we got the rth success, on the xth trial, we see that there are r – 1 success, and x – r failures 
in the first x–1 trials. Since the trials are independent we can multiply all the probabilities corresponding 
to each desired outcome. Therefore the probability for the specified order, ending in the rth success, is

Normal Distribution
The Normal Distribution was first discovered in the eighteenth century. Astronomers and other 
scientists observed that repeated measurements of the same quantity (like the distance or the mass of 
an object) tended to vary, and when large of these measurements are taken and collected into a frequency 
distribution, one shape, similar to the normal curve kept repeating. The Normal distribution is often 
referred to as the Gaussian distribution, in honor of Karl Friedrich Gauss (1777–1855), who also derived 
its equation from a study of errors in repeated measurements of the same quantity, Check Figure 7.
The normal distribution is no doubt the most important distribution in statistics, and the most widely 
used continuous probability distribution. There are 4 basic reasons why the normal distribution occupies 
a prominent place in statistics.

Random Variables and Probability Distributions
2.	 The normal distribution provides an accurate approximation to a large number of 
probability laws, e.g. the binomial distribution.
3.	 The normal distribution plays an important role in the theory of inferential statistics and 
statistical inferences. This property is clear in the field because the distribution of the mean 
and the sample proportion and many other statistics of large samples tend to be normally 
distributed.
4.	 If the data do not follow a normal distribution, a certain transformation could be used in 
many cases to change it to normal data.
The probability density function (pdf) for a normally distributed random variable X, with mean μ and 
variance σ2, in short; X ~ N (μ, σ2), is given by
f(x) = 
2

exp[ (
) / (2
)],

m
s

p
−
−
 –∞< x <∞, –∞ < μ <∞, and 0 < σ<∞.
In the above notation, for the pdf of the normal random variable X, μ is the mean, or the location 
parameter, while σ is the standard deviation, the shape, or scale parameter. Due to the extensive use of 
the above pdf for finding probabilities, and to the exhaustive and wide range of the values for the mean 
and the standard deviation of X, a unique table has been introduced based on transforming the above 
general R.V. to the standard normal R.V. Z, where Z = (X–μ)/σ, and thus Z ~ N (0, 1), and it is called 
the standard normal distribution, Figure 8.
Figure 8 
This transformation has tremendously reduced the volumes of the tables that will correspond to the 
different values of μ & σ, into one single table. Some basic properties of the probability density function 
for normal random variable X are
1.	 f(x) is nonnegative all over the real line.
2.	 The graph of f(x) is symmetric around the value μ, and it is bell-shaped, Figure 9.

 i.e. the total area under the curve

4.	 The horizontal axis acts as a horizontal asymptote to the curve of the normal pdf.
5.	 Areas under the graph of the normal density function represent probabilities. The value of 
the integral of f(x) over the interval (a, b) represents the probability that a ≤x ≤b, in other

7.	 The Empirical Rule: or 68 – 95 – 99.7 rule, is the statistical rule for a normal distribution 
determined by the mean and the standard deviation. Approximately 68% of the area under 
the normal curve is between X = μ – σ and x = μ + σ, and 95% of the area under the normal 
curve is between X = μ – 2σ and x = μ +2σ, while 99.7% of the area under the normal curve 
is between X = μ – 3σ and x = μ + 3σ, check Figure 11A.
In terms of probability and mathematical notation the above facts can be expressed as follows: 
P (μ–σ≤ x ≤ μ +σ) ≈ 0.6827, 
P (μ–2σ≤ x ≤ μ +2σ) ≈ 0.9545, and 
P (μ–3σ≤ x ≤ μ+ 3 σ2σ) ≈ 0.9973
EXAMPLE 2.14:
The scores for all high school seniors taking the verbal section of the Scholastic Aptitude Test 
(SAT) in a particular year had a mean of 490 and a standard deviation of 100. The distribution

a)	 What percentage of seniors scored between 390 and 590 on this SAT test?
b)	 One student scored 795 on this test. How did this student do compared to the rest of the 
scores?
c)	 A rather exclusive university only admits students who were among the highest 16% of 
the scores on this test. What score would a student need on this test to be qualified for 
admittance to this university? 
 Figure 11A (Internet)
For the example above we have X ~N (490, 1002), Figure 6A displays the areas noted above.
Solution:
The data being described are the verbal SAT scores for all seniors taking the test one year. Since 
this is describing a population, we will denote the mean and standard deviation as μ = 490 and 
σ = 100, respectively. A bell shaped curve summarizing the percentages given by the empirical 
rule is below.
a)	 From the Figure 11A above, about 68% of seniors scored between 390 and 590 on this 
SAT test. 
b)	 Since about 99.7% of the scores are between 190 and 790, a score of 795 is excellent. This 
is one of the highest scores on this test.
c)	 Since about 68% of the scores are between 390 and 590, this leaves 32% of the scores 
outside this interval. Since a bell-shaped curve is symmetric, one-half of the scores, or 
16%, are on each end of the distribution. Figure 11B, below, shows these percentages.

EXAMPLE 2.15: 
The weight of a certain type of chicken, at a certain age, follows a normal distribution with 
mean 1.0 kg and a standard deviation of 0.20 kg. Find
a)	 The probability that a chicken weighs less than 1.50 kg.
b)	 The probability that a chicken weighs between 0.90 kg and 1.20 kg.
c)	 The probability that a chicken weighs more than 1.60 kg.
d)	 The percentage of the chickens that weigh between 0.890 kg and 1.50 kg.
e)	 Among a group of 300 chickens how many will weigh between 0.80 and 1.50 kg?
Solution:
Let X be the weight of a chicken, then X has a normal distribution with μ =1.0, and σ=0.2, i.e. 
X ~ N (1.0, 0.04). By using Z = (X -μ)/σ, we have 
a)	 P(X < 1.5) = P[(X -μ)/σ < (1.5 -μ)/σ] = P(z < 2.5) = 0.9938
b)	 P(0.9 < X < 1.2) = P(X < 1.2) – P(X <0.9) = P(Z < 1) – P(Z < -0.5) = 0.8413 – 0.3085 
= 0.5328
c)	 P (X > 1.6) = 1 – P(X ≤1.6) =1 – P (Z ≤3.0) = 1 – 0. 9987 = 0.0013
d)	 P (0.89 < X < 1.5) = P (Z < 2.5) – P (Z< -1.0) = 0.9938 – 0.1587 = 0.8351 = 83.51%.
e)	 0.8351* 300 = 250.53 ≈251.

We find a large number of values for the mean, for the variance, and also for the variable itself. There 
is no way that a table, or tables, will be made for any combination of those values. Having another look 
at the standardizing formula, namely
Z = (X – μ)/σ,
We see that just one table is needed. That table is the Standard Normal Table for the Random Variable 
Z which is distributed as Z ∼ N (0, 1), Check Figure 8.
Having done what we did so far for the normal distribution, let us discuss the procedure for finding the 
area under the normal curve. For the general normal random variable we have: X ∼ N(μ, σ2). There are

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

With no doubt that we can find the required probabilities for any value of the variable X, any value for 
the mean, and any value for the standard deviation. Calculus techniques had been used just to do that. 
This save a lot of time and resources, and reduced the tremendous number of tables into just ONE, the 
standard normal Table. Therefore if we use the transformation
Z = (X–μ)/σ,
the above three cases for finding the probabilities can be calculated by using the standard normal table. 
The equivalent case, in terms oz will look like the following

Let X ∼ N(70,100), where μ = 70, and σ = 10. Find
1. P (56.5 < X < 90.1),		
2. P (X < 73.2),	 	
and	
	
3. P (X > 86.8).
Solution:
Transforming the values by standardizing we see that, the above probabilities can be found by 
using the standard normal table for the corresponding values of z as follows:
1.	 P (56.5 < X < 90.1) = P [(56.5-70)/10] < Z < (90.1-70)/10] = P (-1.35 < Z < 2.01)
 = P (Z<2.01) – P (Z< -1.35) = 0.9778 – 0.0885 = 0.8893.

INVNorm(Area to the left, Mean, Standard deviation), and press enter to get the value of x to any

distribution with np = λ.) This approximation is satisfactory whenever n is large and p value is 
near 0 or 1. If p is near 0.50 and n is large then the normal distribution is used to approximate

Estimation
3.1	
Sampling
The purpose of sampling is to enable us to make inferences about a population after inspecting only 
a portion (a sample) of that population. Such factors as cost, time, destructive testing, and infinite 
populations make sampling preferable to making a complete inspection (census, complete enumeration) 
of a population. Usually, there are some numerical characteristics about the population which the 
investigator wants to know. Such numerical facts are called parameters; e.g., the population size, 
population mean, a proportion of some attribute, and variability in the population, etc.
A Parameter is a numrical value, or a characteristc, of a population
The parameters cannot be determined exactly, but can only be estimated from a sample by quantities 
called statistics. 
A Statistic is a numerical summary, or a characteristc, of a sample.
Then a major issue is accuracy. How close the estimators (the statistics) are to the true values (the 
parameters)? Logically, we will get an accurate estimate if the sample is representative of the population 
from which it was drawn. How to get a sample, and make sure we have a fairly large representative 
sample. There are two categories of sampling methods.
3.1.1	
Non-Probability Sampling
a)	 Convenience Probability Sampling: The sample is restricted to a part of the population that 
is readily accessible. A sample of coal from an open wagon may be taken from the top 6 to 9 
inches.
b)	 Haphazard sampling: The sample is selected haphazardly by picking a sample of ten rabbits 
from a large cage in a laboratory. The investigator may take those that his hands rest on, 
without conscious to planning.
c)	 Judgment (or subjective) sampling: With a small but heterogeneous population, the 
investigator selects a small sample of “typical” units – that are most representative of the 
population according to his judgment.
d)	 Volunteer sampling: The sample consists of essentialy volunteers because the measuring 
process is unpleasant or troublesome to the person being measured. This, particulary, occurs 
in medical research, and clinical trials.

Estimation
Under the right conditions, any of the above methods, of non-probability sampling, may give a 
representative sample of the population. However, there are two disadvantages:
1.	 There may be a systematic tendency on the part of the sampling procedure to exclude one 
kind of a unit or another from the sample. This is called selection bias.
2.	 Non-probability sampling is not amenable to the development of sample theory, since no 
element of random selection is employed. That is, we cannot compute the precision, or any 
quantity measuring the error of the estimators.
3.1.2 	
Probability Sampling Methods
There is a definite procedure, for selecting the sampling units, that involves the planned use of chance. 
In a probability sampling procedure, the laws of probability can be applied to compute the chance of 
selecting the different samples and the individual units. Also, the frequency distribution and the precision 
of the estimators can be computed, at least theoretically. In probability sampling, the investigator has no 
discretion at all as to which units to select. There is no selection bias.
A very important and basic type of probability sampling is the Simple Random Sampling. Variations of 
simple random sampling include systematic, stratified, and cluster sampling. These sampling methods, 
in addition to the non-probability convenience sampling, make the methods of sampling in statistics. 
Let us give a formal definition for each of the four mentioned sampling methods.

Estimation
Simple random sampling: Simple random sampling selects samples, of size n, by methods that allow 
each possible sample of size n to have an equally likely chance or equal probability of being considered. 
In addition, each unit, in the entire population, has an equal chance of being included in the sample in 
each single drawing.
EXAMPLE 3.1
A small community college employs 58 full-time faculty members. To gain the faculty’s opinion 
about upcoming contract negotiations, the president of the faculty union wishes to obtain a 
simple random sample that will consist of 5 faculty members. How will you help in selecting 
the committee members by a simple random sampling?
Solution:
Using Table I, the Random Number Table, from the Appendix, let the prsident close her eyes 
and drop a pencil on the Table. It points to row 19, and column 7. Let this be the starting point. 
Since the numbers of the faculty are two digits, so 1 will be representd by 01, and so on till we 
get all faculty identified by their numbers. Based on that, we need to consider columns 7 and 
8, for the two digits. So the following sample will occur: 29, 32, 09, 58, and 12. those faculty 
members with the corresponding numbers will be on the committee.
 
 
A Systematic Sample is obtained by selecting every kth individual from the population. The first individual 
selected correspond to a random number between 1 and k.
Steps in Systematic sampling
1.	 Make sure that you have a finite population of size N, and enumerate each individual.
2.	 Decide on how large your sample will be, n.
3.	 Calculate N/n, and round, up or down, to an integer. Let that integer be k.
4.	 Randomly select a number between 1 and k, call that number j.
5.	 Thus the sample will consist of the following enumerated individuals:
j, j+k, j+2k, …j+(n-1)k.
EXAMPLE 3.2
The human resources department at a certain company wants to conduct a survey regarding 
workers benefits. The department has an alphabetical list of all 2949 employees at the company 
and wants to conduct a systematic sampling of size 30. 
 A) What is k    B) Determine the individuals who will be administering the survey. Choose 
j, and suppose that we randomly selected 20, who will be in the survey?

Applied Statistics
121 
Estimation
Solution: 
K = 2949/30 = 98. From the information we have j = 20. Thus the units in the sample will be: 
20, 118, 216, …, 2862.
 
A Stratified Sample is obtained by dividing the population into separate homogeneous categories, or 
groups, that do not overlap. These are called Strata (the singular is Stratum) and then take a sample by 
simple random sampling from each stratum. These chosen subsamples will form the stratified sample 
needed.
EXAMPLE 3.3
There is a class of 400 students enrolled in a multi section course Stat 1350. You like to have 
a committee representing the class, and every section in the class. The groups here are the 
different sections of students.
Solution:
The strata here are the different sections in the course. Thus the course divided, and based 
on how many will be on the committee, you choose at random from that section, and choose 
from that stratum at random, and repeat until you get your members.
 
A Cluster Sample is obtained like the stratified sample by dividing the popultion into groups, obtain a 
simple random sample from the proups, as a whole, and select all the individuals within the randomly 
selcted group or stratum. 
EXAMPLE 3.4: 
The above example can be redone by clustering. Here once the section, or stratum was chosen, 
then every one in that “section” will be taken into the sample.
 
Recall that technology is being used to do almost any kind of sampling. For example, you can use 
MINITAB for obtaining a sample.
In the rest of the text we will confine ourselves to probability sampling, especially to Simple Random 
Sampling (SRS). For more detailed discussion on sampling techniques, the interested reader is referred 
to Cochran, 1978.

Point Estimation
Estimation stands as the first part of inferential statistics, while the second part is the hypothesis testing. 
There are two types of estimation: point estimation and interval estimation. We will address the point 
estimation in this section. The interval estimation will be addressed in the next section.
A point Estimate is that value of a statistic, which has been calculated from a sample, that estimates a 
parameter of the population. 
In this section, we will consider the point estimation of proportions, population’s mean and population’s 
variance.
3.2.1	
Methods of Estimation (Optional)
 let us outline the procedures by which we can find the point estimators of a parameter. The procedures 
to be used here are: (1) the method of moments, and (2) the maximum liklihood method.

is called the kth sample moment, for k = 1, 2, 3, … . while E [Xk] is called kth population moment, 
for k = 1, 2, 3, … . Thus the method of moments estimators of the parameters is given by setting the 
sample moments equal to population moments and solving the resulting equations simlutaneously, for 
the parameters of the population.
Maximum likelihood estimators
The essential feature of the principle of maximum likelihood estimation, as it applies to the problem of 
estimation, is that it requires the investigator to choose as an estimate of the parameter that value of the 
parameter for which there is the apriori probability of obtaining the sample point actually observed, is 
as large as possible. This probability will in general depend on the parameter, which is then given that 
value for which this probability is as large as possible.
Suppose that the population random variable X has a probability function which depends on some 
parameter θ =Pr [X=x] = f (x; θ). We suppose that the form of the function f is known, but not the 
value of θ. The joint probability function of the sample random variables, evaluated at the sample point 
( x1, x2, …, xn), is
L (θ) = f (X1, X2, …, Xn; θ) = 
1
n
Π f (xi, θ).
This function is also known as the likelihood function of the sample. We are considering it as a function 
of θ when the sample values x1, x2, …, xn are fixed.
The principle of maximum likelihood requires us to choose as an estimate of the unknown parameter 
that value of θ for which the likelihood function assumes its maximum value.
3.2.2 	
Statistics as Estimators for Parameters
It is clearly visible that we use statistics to estimate parameters due to the lack of time, energy, resources, 
and infinite populations. Statistics, from the sample, can be listed as: proportions, Arithmatic averages, 
ranges, quartiles, deciles, percentiles, variances, and standard deviations. It will become clear enough 
what each one means and what it will stand for.

Estimation
A) The sample proportion
Suppose that there is a population in which each individual either does or does not have a certain 
characteristc. We like to consider a random sample out of this population. Selecting an individual from 
this population is an experiment that has ONLY two outcomes: either that individual has the characteristic 
we are intersted in or does not.This kind of an experimant is called a Bernoulli expriment that has two 
outcomes, from now on labelled, a success or a failure. Let a random sample of size n be taken from this 
population. The sample proportion, denoted by ˆp (read “p-hat”), is given by
ˆ
x
p
n
=
.
Here x is the number of individuals in the sample with the specified characteristic. The sample proportion
ˆp  is a statistic that estimates the population proportion, p, which is a parameter.
EXAMPLE 3.5
On the first day of the semester, in Stat 1350, asking a class of 30 students the following	
 question: Who has a calculator? 12 students raised their hands by showing that they have a 
calculator. Estimate the percentage of the students, in this class, that have a calculator.
Solution:
By our notation we see that n = 30, and x = 12. Therefore ˆ

“σ” (lower case Greek sigma). To estimate μ and σ, we draw a simple random sample of size n: x1, x2, …, 
xn. Then compute the sample mean

Estimation
Solution:
Let μ be the true average content of nitrogen and let σ be the true variation in the nitrogen 
content. Then, μ is estimated by X and σ is estimated by S. Using thedata on hand, we find that 
 X = 8.10/9 = 0.90 grams per 100 cc. and 
S2 = 1/8 { 7.3220 – (8.10)2/9} = 0.004 (grams)2 per 100 cc.
Hence S = 0.063 grams per 100 cc.
 
It is clear that different possible samples could be drawn from the same population. Each of those samples 
yields a different value for X, and aother different value for s2. One may inquire about the average value 
of all possible Xs, their standard deviation and their distribution. Likewise for s2.
The following properties are of theoretical nature and are very essential to the theory of statistical 
inference. (For proofs and more details see, e.g., Hogg & Craig, 1978).
3.2.3 	
Properties of the Estimators and their Sampling Distributions
In the frst part of this section, we have estimated the fraction of defectives p of the binomial distribution, 
the mean and the standard deviation of a population by using the observations x1, x2, …, xn that were 
obtained bvy sampling from the distribution of interest. With no doubt that those estimators do not 
equal the true values of the estimated parameters of the interesting distribution. For example, if other 
samples were taken from the sample distribution, we find that we can have other values for the same 
parameters. Since the estimates vary from one sample to another, it becomes essential and important to 
investigate the sampling distributions of those estimators. What is a sampling distribution? Depending 
on the parameter we are esimating, then the sampling distribution of that estimator, for a given sample 
size n, consists of the collection of all the estimators of that parameter, of all possible samples of size n 
from that population. Although the derivation of the following result is beyond the scope of our text, 
we should be convinced that the following result is reasonable.
Sampling Distribution of ˆp
For a simple random sample of size n such that n is at most 0.05N (that is the sample size is less than 
5% of the population size) (check chapter 2)
•	 The shape of the sampling distribution of ˆp  is approximately normal provided np(1- p) is 
at least 10,
•	 The mean of the sampling distribution of p is 
ˆp
m = p
•	 The standard deviation of the sampling distribution of ˆp is

Estimation
The condition that the sample size is no more than 5% of the population size is needed so that result 
obtained from one individual is independent of the result obtained from any other individual in the 
sample. The Condition of np(1-p) is at least 10 for normality and help for making inferences later on.
Sampling Distribution of X
To describe the sampling distribution of the sample mean X, we need the following definition or 
assumption. It is clearly understood and makes more sense that the more information we get from the 
population the closer the statistics values will be to their corresponding parameters. This led us to define 
the following concept of Law of Large Numbers.
Suppose that a simple random sample of size n is drawn from a large population with mean μ and 
variance σ2. The sampling distribution of X will have a mean that is equal to the population mean μ,  
and a variance which is given by σ2/n.
The Law of Large Numbers: As additional observations are included in the sample, the difference 
between the statistic X (the sample mean) and the parameter μ (the population mean) approaches 0.
In addition to the above, when n increases the sample mean become very close to the population mean, 
and we see that the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of X decreases as n increases. Hence 
we have the theorem that referred to as the CLT, the Central Limit Theorem. 
Regardless of the shape of the population, whether it was normal or not, the sampling distribution 
of X becomes approximately normal as n increases with mean and variance as specified above.
The interested reader might consult the above reference for the proof of the stated result (For proofs and 
more details see, e.g., Hogg & Craig, 1978). 
3.3	
Interval Estimation
An Interval Estimation is a range of values, calculated based on the information in the sample, that the 
parameter in a population will be within that range with some degree of confidence.
Suppose that a scientist wishes to weigh an ore sample with high precision. Because of a random error 
in measurements, he takes several readings and averages them by computing X. He may report his 
estimate of the true weight as: 
1.	 As point estimate, X or
2.	 As an interval, X ± E, where E stands for the error. It is the margin of error.

Applied Statistics
128 
Estimation
It is seen that a point estimate is a single value that is used to estimate an unknown population parameter. 
A point estimate is often insufficient because it is right or wrong. If the scientist reports that the estimated 
weight is 404 micrograms, (mg), then he does not really mean that the true weight is exactly 404 mg, 
and he should report how much error is involved. Also, it is insufficient to report that the true mean is 
within the range of values X ± 1S.E. because he does not report how much confidence he has in such 
a statement. 
The best thing that can be done is to report estimates as “interval estimates”. An interval estimate (or a 
confidence interval) is a range of values used to estimate a population parameter with a certain degree 
of confidence. The confidence interval indicates the error of estimation in two ways: i) by the extent 
of its range and ii) by the probability of the true population parameter will be lying within that range.
In the following sections, we will introduce how to construct a confidence interval for estimating one 
or two population parameters, and specify the probability as a level of confidence.
3.4 	
Confidence Interval about One Parameter
In this section we will address the procedures on how to calculate the confidence interval on one 
parameter. Those parameters are the proportion, the mean, and the variance of a population.

Confidence Interval about One Proportion
It is of interest to estimate the proportion of employees, who favor a certain type of work, or the 
proportion of defective items in a certain lot, or the proportion of rats having a certain kind of symptoms. 
Let P be the true proportion of elements that have attribute A (a certain characteristic of interest) in a 
population. We draw a simple random sample of size n from this population and let X equal number 
of elements in the sample that have attribute A. Thus the point estimate of the true proportion p in the 
population is given by ˆp = X/n, where X has a binomial distribution with parameters n and p. Recall that  
E(X) = np, and Var (X) = n.p. (1-p). Hence we find that E ( ˆp) = p, and Var ( ˆp) = p.(1-p)/n. By the 
Central Limit Theorem, the random variable given

as n increases. Thus

where Z is the value of the standard normal variable comprising a probability of alpha on its right. This,

Based on the above confidence interval, when the two limits are given, we can find the sample proportion 
by the following equation:
The lower limit + the upper limit = 2(sample proportion).
EXAMPLE 3.7
In a simple random sample of 500 employees, 160 preferred to take training classes in the 
morning rather than in the afternoon. Construct a 95% C.I. on the true proportion of employees 
who favor morning training classes.
Solution:
From the information on hand we have; x =160, n = 500, the confidence level is 0.95, and so 
ˆp= 0.32, alpha = 0.05, and Z0.025= 1.96. By substitution in the above interval we find that 0.28 
< p < 0.36.
This means that the true proportion, of the employees who favor the morning training classes, 
is between 28% and 36%.

Confidence Interval about One Mean
Let there be a population with mean μ and variance σ2. We wish to construct a confidence interval about, 
μ with 100(1- α) % confidence level, where 0 < α < 1. There are three cases to be considered here. For 
the following cases, we will have a simple random sample of size n from the original population. Let 
that sample be Xi, i =1, 2, …, n.
Case I: The variance of the population is known, In this case the random variable

The above interval is called a z-interval about the mean μ. It is to be noticed here that we can find the 
sample mean or the margin of error when the limits of any confidence interval are given. This based on 
the following two equations:
The Lower limit + the Upper limit = 2(the sample mean), while
The upper limit – the lower limit = 2(the margin of error).
Case II: The variance of the population is unknown, with a large sample size (n ≥ 30)
Since σ is not known, and we have a random sample, we estimate σ by the standard deviation of the 
sample on hand. By replacing σ by s in the above z-interval we reach at the following interval that will 
be the 100(1 – α) % C.I. on μ,

Case III: The variance of the population is unknown, with a small sample size (n < 30)
Since we have a small sample, and the variance of the population is not known, we ask ourselves Is the 
population Normally distributed. If not, we stop here and a non-parametric approach is needed. Non-
parametric statistics is a field by itself and it is not discussed in the text. But if the answer is yes, that 
the population is normally distributed then the following approach will be applied to construct a C.I. 
about μ. Consider the random variable that is defined below

This random variable will have a student t-distribution with n-1 degrees of freedom. (In two sentences, 
the t-distribution behaves like the standard normal distribution, with variance >1. It is characterized 
by its degrees of freedom, and as n increases the t- distribution tends to be very close to the standard 
normal distribution.) With the random variable T, as given above we see that

EXAMPLE 3.8
Suppose that an investigator wishes to estimate the content of mercury in the water of a 
certain area. He collected 16 measurements and obtained the following data (as ppm, parts 
per million): 409, 400, 406, 399, 402, 406, 401, 403, 401, 403, 398, 403, 407, 402, 410, and 399. 
The investigator wishes to report the results as a confidence interval with 95% confidence level.
Solution: 
Clearly, the variance of the population, and hence the standard deviation, is not known. The 
sample size is small, n = 16 < 30. Thus we well assume that the population is normal, and 
proceed as in case III. From the data we can get the following statistics: n=16, X = 403.063 ppm 
and S2 = 12.996, from which we see that S = 3.605 ppm. With the significance level of 0.05 we 
have from the t-table, with 15 degrees of freedom, t.025 =2.131. Incorporating all of these values 
we reach at the 95% C.I. on the mean content of mercury in the water to be (401.143, 404.983)

3.4.3	
Confidence Interval about One Variance
In studying the precision of measuring instruments, and in studying variability in populations, we face 
the problem of estimating the population variance, or its standard deviation from a random sample. In 
this section we will investigate how to construct a confidence interval on either the population variance 
or the standard deviation. For to have a good confidence and excellent estimation for a 100(1 –α) % 
C.I. on the population variance we need to assume that that population has a normal distribution with 
some variance σ2.
From a random sample of size n; X1, X2… Xn, taken from that normal population, we can see that

Human beings vary in the time it takes them to respond to driving hazards. In one experiment 
in which 100 healthy adults between age 21 and 30 years were subjected to a certain driving 
hazard, and the sample variance of the observed times it took them to respond was 0.0196 
second squared. Assuming that the times to respond are normally distributed, estimate the 
variability in the time response of the given age group using a 95% C.I.
Solution:
The confidence level is 0.95, so that α/2 = 0.025. Reading the χ2-Table with 100 -1 = 99 degrees

It is quite clear when the sample is too small; the required precision is not achieved. On the other hand, 
when the sample size is large, then some resources have been wasted. In order to meet the criterion of 
a specified margin of error calculations can be made to approximate the sample size needed in both 
cases of the mean and the proportion. Also, checking the formulas above for E, we find that each has 
4 quantities. Thus whenever three of those are given the fourth can be found. In case of finding the 
sample size, the rounding will be up to the nearest whole number in order to meet the error criterion.

Estimation
This formula will give the sample size when E, the confidence level 100(1 – α) %, and the population 
standard deviation are given.
In case for finding the needed sample size to meet a certain criterion for estimating the population 
proportion, we have two cases to consider:
1)	 If there is an estimated value for that proportion p, and
2)	 If there is no information about P. 
The formulae for n will be, respectively, given by

EXAMPLE 3.10
Suppose you want to estimate the average weight of chickens in a laboratory. You like to be 95% 
certain that the error is at most 0.1lbs. How many chickens you should include in your sample?
Solution: 
The error is E = 0.1, the confidence level is 95%, and thus Zα/2 = 1.96. We are still missing the 
standard deviation, in the weight of the population σ. There is away to guess that, or to use 
an estimated value. Pick up the heaviest and the lightest chickens, and weigh those two. Find 
the range in the two weights, R. A rough estimate of σ is R/6. Let that range to be 1.5 lbs. and 
hence σ = 0.25 lbs. Hence the required sample size is n = 25 chickens.

EXAMPLE 3.11
An economist wants to know if the proportion of the population who commutes to work 
via carpooling is on the increase due to gas prices. What sample size should be obtained if 
the economist wants to estimate with 2 percentage points of the true proportion with90% 
confidence if
a)	 The economist uses the 2006 estimate of 10.7% obtained from the American Community 
Survey?
b)	 The economist does not use any prior estimates?

We can see the effect of not having a prior estimate of p. In this case, the required sample size

Confidence Interval about two Parameters
The confidence intervals to be calculated on two parameters will involve: a) two means, b) two proportions, 
c) two variances, and two standard deviations. In addition to those parameters, we will establish a 
confidence interval between the means of two matched samples. For the means and proportions the 
confidence intervals will be established on the difference between the two parameters, while in the case 
of two variances or two standard deviations, the confidence interval will be on the ratio between the 
two parameters.
3.6.1	
Confidence Interval about the difference between two proportions
Comparisons of proportions, in different groups, are a common practice. A whole-seller compares the 
proportions of defective items found in two separate sources of supply from which he buys these items. 
A safety engineer compares the proportions of head injuries sustained in an automobile accident by 
passengers with seat belts against those without seat belts.
Consider two independent samples of sizes n1 and n2 that are drawn from two binomial populations with 
parameters (i.e. probabilities of successes) p1 and p2. A 100(1 – α) % confidence interval will derived on 
the difference between p1 and p2 using the central limit theorem and the normal approximation to the 
binomial distribution.
Let x1 and x2 be the number of successes obtained in sample 1 and sample 2 respectively. We then have 
1P =
)
 x1/n1 and 
2P =
)
 x2/n2 as the point estimates of p1 and p2 respectively. Moreover we have
E (
1P
)
) =
1P
)
, E (
2P)
) = p2, with Var (
1P
)
) = p1 (1- p1)/n1 and Var (
2P)
) = p2 (1- p2)/n2.

Estimation
EXAMPLE 3.12
A certain change in a manufacturing procedure for component parts is being considered. 
Samples were taken using both the old and the new procedures in order to determine the 
difference induced by the new procedure. Suppose that 75 out 1500 items, from the existing 
procedure, were found defective, and 80 out 2000 items, from the new procedure were found 
to be defective. Find a 90% C.I. on the true difference in the fraction of defectives between 
the two procedures.
Solution: 
Let p1 and p2 be the true proportions of defectives in the existing and new procedures, 
respectively. Thus we have x1 = 75 and x2 = 80, with n1 = 1500 and n2 = 2000. With  
1 – α = 0.90, we see that Z0.05 = 1.645, using the Standard Normal Table, and with the above 
limits on the difference between the fraction of defectives between the two procedures we 
found that the 90% C.I. is given as 
 -0.0017 < p1 – p2 < 0.0217
 
Notice as the interval contains zero, there is no reason to believe that the new procedure reduces the 
proportion of defectives.
3.6.2 	
Confidence Interval about the difference between Two Means
It is quite often the following question is raised: Which average of those two means which are under 
investigation is better, or higher or smaller, or worse? In comparative experiments the investigator wishes 
to estimate the difference between two processes based on the difference between their means. For 
example, a chemist likes to compare the effects of two catalysts on the output of some chemical reactions. 
An agronomist wants to estimate the difference in yield of two varieties of corn. These questions and 
many others lead us to investigate how to estimate the difference between two means based on finding 
the confidence interval about that difference.
Assume that there are two populations with their means and variances given 
im and 
2
i
s
 for i =1, 2 
respectively. These populations could be normally distributed or not, as the discussion will reveal the 
cases below. We will select two simple random samples of sizes ni, i = 1, 2, and denote them by Xj and 
Yj, j = 1,2, …. ni. Based on the data, from the samples, we can compute the mean and the variance for 
each sample, which are given by X, 
2
1S  and Y and 
2
2S . There are four cases to be considered. Each case 
will be addressed based on the data and the information on hand.

little algebra manipulation we reach at the 100(1 – α) % C.I. on the difference

Remarks on the confidence Interval about two means
When constructing a confidence interval about the difference between two means, we must verify that 
the samples are large enough (n ≥ 30) or the samples should come from populations that are normally 
distributed so that we can use the normal model for the construction of the confidence interval. 
Fortunately, the procedures for constructing confidence intervals presented above are robust, which 
means that minor departures from normality will not seriously affect the results. Verifying normality 
assumption for small sample sizes will be checked by drawing normal probability plot and checking for 
outliers by drawing a box plot.

Case IV: The samples are paired, or dependent, from two populations.
In the previous three cases the 100(1 – α) % C.I., on the difference
1

m

, was constructed on 
the assumption that we have two independent samples from two different populations. Here we will 
investigate the case when the two samples are dependent, or related in any way. Sometimes the comparative 
experiment is conducted in a different way: pairs of similar individuals or objects are selected randomly. 
A common application occurs in self-pairing in which a single individual is measured on two occasions, 
usually, before and after some treatment. For example, the blood pressure of a subject might be measured 
before and after a heavy exercise; the weight of a person is measured before and after being on a certain 
diet. The analysis of paired samples is treated differently from that of independent samples, and the 
investigator has to be aware of the samples are paired or independent. The two dependent samples will 
be reduced to one sample of paired data, i.e. the sample of the differences of the data points between the 
two samples. An advantage of pairing data is resulted in the assumption of equal population variances is 
not needed any more. Based on this discussion, we will derive the Confidence interval for the difference 
between two population means when the samples are dependent.
Let (Xi, Yi), i = 1,2,…., n form the paired observations of the two random samples. The assumption here 
is that the X’s have come from a population with mean N (μ1, 
2
1
s
) and the Y’s have come from another 
population that is N (μ2, 
2
2
s
). For the analysis, as mentioned earlier, we form the sample of differences 
di = Xi – Yi, i= 1, 2, …, n. Thus we have

Confidence Interval about the Ratio between Two Variances
It is desired sometimes to compare two processes or procedures based on their variability. A company, for 
example, sells frozen shrimp may have two methods of packaging. The two procedures give an average 
content of 12 ounces, but the packaging of one method seems to be more variable than the other. In this 
case the comparison of the two methods will be based on the variances of each.
It is quite clear that the difference between variances is not suitable to apply here. The procedure to 
obtain a confidence interval to measure the variability between the two methods will rely on the ratio 
of the two population variances. Thus we will proceed as follows.
Consider the following two independent random samples Xi , i = 1, 2, …, n1 , and Yj , j = 1, 2, …, n2 
that were taken from two normal populations that have μ1 and μ2 as their mans with 
2

s
 and 
2

as 
their variances respectively. In other words, we have Xi ≈ N (μ1,

The reason we generate 10 rows of data (instead of 5) is in case any of the random numbers repeat. Notice 
also that the parameter is between 1 and 31, so any value greater than or equal 1 and less than or equal 31 
is possible. In the unlikely event that 31 appeared simply ignore it. Select OK and the random numbers 
will appear in column 1(A1) in the spreadsheet. (Ignore any values to the right of the decimal place.)

Testing of Statistical Hypotheses
4.1	
Introduction
Testing a statistical hypothesis is the second main and major part of inferential statistics. A statistical 
hypothesis is an assumption or a statement, about one or two parameters and involving one or more 
than one population. A statistical hypothesis may or may not be true. We need to decide, based on the 
data in a sample, or samples, whether the stated hypothesis is true or not. If we knew all the members of 
the population, then it is possible to say with certainty whether or not the hypothesis is true. However, 
in most cases, it is impossible, and impractical to examine the entire population. Due to scarcity of 
resources, lack of time, and tedious calculations based on a population, we can only examine a sample 
that hopefully represents that population very well. So the truth or falsity of a statistical hypothesis is 
never known with certainty.
Testing a statistical hypothesis is a technique, or a procedure, by which we can gather some evidence, 
using the data of the sample, to support, or reject, the hypothesis we have in mind.
4.2	
Fundamental Concepts
Any field, and statistics is not an exception, has its own definitions, concepts and terminology. These 
items make the basic building stones in any subject. Knowing these three things, and connecting among 
them, will make the subject coherent, and more at the will of the reader. Based on this, we like to present 
some definitions, and terminology for some concepts that will be used in the text.
A) The Null and Alternative Hypotheses
The first step, in testing a statistical hypothesis, is to set up a null hypothesis and an alternative 
hypothesis. When we conjecture a statement, about one parameter of a population, or two parameters 
of two populations, we usually keep in mind an alternative conjecture to the first one. Only one of the 
conjectures can be true. So, in essence we are weighing the truth of one conjecture against the truth of the 
other. This idea is the first basic principle in testing a statistical hypothesis. For example, an experimenter 
may think that a newly discovered drug is either as effective as, or better than, a currently used one. The 
experimenter wants to weigh the truth of the hypothesis that the new drug is as effective as the old drug 
against the hypothesis that the new drug is actually better than the old one. In statistical terminology, the 
first hypothesis is called the “Null Hypothesis”, i.e. no change, no effect, or no difference, and it is denoted 
by H0, HNaught or Hzero. The second hypothesis is called the “Alternative hypothesis”, i.e., there is a change, 
and it is denoted by Ha or H1, and it will be a statement regarding the value of a population parameter. 
In this text, we will be using H0 and H1 as our Null Hypothesis and Alternative Hypothesis respectively.

Testing of Statistical Hypotheses
B) Possible Decisions
The test procedure will lead to either one of the following decisions:
1.	 Reject the Null Hypothesis, H0, i.e., conclude that H0 is a false statement and this will lead to 
take, or accept, that the alternative hypothesis H1 as a true statement.
2.	 Do not reject the Null hypothesis, H0. This means that there is no evidence from the sample, 
to disprove the null hypothesis. The non-rejection of H0 should not imply that it is true. This 
is because the objective of testing a statistical hypothesis is to disprove, or reject, the null 
hypothesis with a high certainty, rather than to prove it. Thus if the statistical test rejects H0 
then we are highly certain that it is false. However, if the test does not reject H0, then we 
interpret the non-rejection as that the sample does not give enough evidence to disprove 
the null hypothesis. In other words, the rejection of the null hypothesis is the decisive 
conclusion that we can depend on.
Based on the decision, whether to “Reject H0” or “Do Not Reject H0”, we should be careful in stating 
the null and alternative hypotheses. This is due to the fact that originally we have two statements to be 
examined against each other and we may call either one of them the null hypothesis. But since we are 
only highly confident about the conclusion of rejecting the null hypothesis, we take H0 as the statement 
that the sample will reject. On the other hand, the alternative hypothesis will be that statement which 
we hope that the data will support.
In the drug example above, the experimenter wants to prove that the new drug is better than the old 
one. So, the experimenter wants to disprove the statement that the new drug is as effective as the old 
one. Based on that, he should set the hypotheses as
H0: The new drug is as effective as the old one.
H1: The new drug is more effective than the old drug.
C) Types of Errors
The procedure, in testing a statistical hypothesis, either rejects the null hypothesis or not. Of course the 
truth is never known, i.e. we do not know whether H0 is true or not. The “true state of nature” may then 
be that H0 is true or H0 is false. We make the decision of rejecting the null hypothesis or not rejecting 
it, without knowing the true state of nature. In making a decision about testing a statistical hypothesis, 
two types of errors may be committed:

Testing of Statistical Hypotheses
Type I Error: A Type I error has been committed if the test rejects the null hypothesis when in fact it is 
true. The probability of making such an error will be denoted by α, (The Greek letter Alpha). For sure, 
it is clear that 0 ≤α≤ 1.
Type II Error: A Type II error has been committed if the test does not reject H0 when H0 is false. The 
probability of making such an error will be denoted by β, (the Greek letter Beta) with 0 ≤β≤ 1. What is 
more important is that we do not like to make such errors with high probabilities.
In either one of the other two cases, there is no error committed, as shown by Table I.

Testing of Statistical Hypotheses
Level of Significance: The probability of committing a type I error is denoted by (Alpha) α. It is called 
the theoretical level of significance for the test. The most common used values for α are: 0.01, 0.05, or 
0.10. Other values for α are at the discretion of the researcher. More expressions for α are: 
α	 = P (committing a type I error),
= P (rejecting H0 when H0 is true),
= P (rejecting H0 when H1 is false).
The probability of committing a type II error is denoted by (beta) β. Other labels for β are:
β	 = P (committing a type II error),
= P (not rejecting H0 when H0 is false),
= P (not rejecting H0 when H1 is true).
Power of the Test: The value of 1– β, which stands for P (rejecting H0 when H0 is false) is the power 
of the test. 
The probabilities of type I and Type II errors tell us how good the test is. Clearly we do not like to make 
a type I error with high probability, as well as we like to make a correct decision with a very high power. 
The smaller these probabilities (of type I error and Type II error) are the better is the test. Ideally, we 
like to use a test procedure for which both type I and type II errors have small probabilities. However, 
it turns out that the type I error and the type II error are related in such a way that a decrease in the 
probability of one of them generally results in an increase in the probability of the other. It is not possible 
to control both probabilities based on a fixed sample size. Traditionally, or by convention, statisticians 
have adopted to fix the level of significance of the test in advance, and to search for a test procedure that 
will minimize the probability of making a type II error, and consequently maximize the power for the 
test. Practically, we can make those probabilities, namely α and β, smaller by taking a larger sample if 
possible. For calculating the probability of type II error, and the power of the test, we direct the interested 
reader to Sullivan 2013.
D) The Test Statistic
The test statistic is a quantity that depends on the information, or statistics, that the sample will provide. 
It is a function of the sample statistics, and the value(s) of the parameter(s) under the null hypothesis. 
Thus a statistic is a random variable until we get some values from the sample. The numerical value of 
the test statistic (large or small) leads us to decide whether or not to reject the Null Hypothesis when it 
is compared to the critical value(s) of the test.

Testing of Statistical Hypotheses
E) The Critical Region or The Rejection Region (CR or RR) 
The critical region is an interval, or a union of intervals, which is determined by using special and certain 
distributions with the appropriate Table values. It depends on the distribution of the test statistic when H0 
is true, on the form of the alternative Hypothesis, and on the level of significance that was set for the test.
F) Conclusion and interpretation 
The final conclusion, of the test procedure, is based on whether or not the computed value of the test 
statistic falls inside the critical region, or not, as follows:
1.	 Reject H0 if the computed value of the test statistic falls in the critical region.
2.	 Do not reject H0 if the computed value of the test statistic does not fall inside the critical 
region.
In either of the two cases detailed above, an interpretation and a practical statement are due in order to 
answer the question that was raised before the test procedure started.

Methods in Testing a Statistical Hypothesis 
There are two methods to test a statistical hypothesis, namely The Classical or Traditional method, 
and the P-value method. Both of these methods will be introduced and used in this text. Based on the 
notation and definitions that were set above, we will list the steps in the Classical method, in general, 
first and then the steps for the p-value method next. More detailed steps will be outlined later based on 
the parameter, or parameters, involved, or stated in the hypotheses.
I	
Classical Method Steps
1.	 Determine, and clearly, state the two hypotheses: H0 and H1. Equality to the assigned 
parameter should be included under the Null Hypothesis.
2.	 Decide on the significance level α. Find the critical value or values, and locate the rejection 
region or regions (all based on the parameter and distribution under consideration).
3.	 Choose the appropriate Test statistic for the hypotheses based on the parameter on hand.
4.	 Using the information provided by the data in the sample, and the computed statistics, 
calculate the test statistic that was chosen in Step 3.
5.	 Make your statistical decision, whether to reject, or not to reject, H0 based on the 
comparison between the computed value of the test statistic and the critical value(s) found 
in Step 2, and as outlined earlier.
6.	 Give the conclusion, or the answer, in a statement that anyone can understand without any 
mathematical jargons or statistical ambiguity.

II.	
P-value Method Steps
1.	 Determine and clearly state the two hypotheses: H0 and H1. Equality to the assigned 
parameter should be included under the Null Hypothesis.
2.	 Decide on the significance level α.
3.	 Choose the appropriate Test statistic for the hypotheses based on the parameter on hand.
4.	 Using the information provided by the data in the sample, and the computed statistics, 
calculate the test statistic that was set up in Step 3.
5.	 Make your statistical decision, whether to reject, or not to reject, H0 based on the 
comparison between the theoretical significance level α, (that was set up above) and the 
calculated p-value. (This p-value is the practical, or attained, significance level, based on the 
type of the test and the distribution of the parameter involved). A p-value less than α will 
lead to the rejection of H0, otherwise do not reject H0.
6.	 Give the conclusion, or the answer to the question, in a statement that anyone can 
understand without any mathematical jargons or statistical ambiguity.
The above steps will be applied to test on one parameter or two parameters whether the test was two 
tailed test or one tailed, left or right test. In the next section we will introduce the test of a statistical 
hypothesis on one parameter. The one parameter case will involve; one proportion, one mean and one 
standard deviation, or one variance.

Hypothesis Testing About One Parameter 
In this section we will discuss, and display, the procedures for testing a statistical hypothesis about one 
population parameter. The one population parameter, which is of interest, will include: one proportion, 
one mean, and one variance or a standard deviation. In general, let that parameter be θ, and its assumed 
value be θ0. Following the steps that were set earlier, we will give the steps in more details for the case 
when one proportion is under investigation. 
It is to be noted here that the two hypotheses are mutually exclusive sets on the real line for the values 
of the parameter, with the equal sign always set to go with the null hypothesis. This is so chosen in order 
to compute the value of the test statistic based on the null hypothesis being true.
Thus the steps will go as follows.
4.4.1	
Hypothesis Testing about One Proportion, P
Recall that the best point estimate of p, the proportion of the population with a certain characteristic, 
is given by 
p) = x/n,
where x is the number of individuals in the sample with the specified characteristic of interest and n is 
the sample size. Recall from Chapter 3 that the sampling distribution of p) is approximately normal, 
with mean

Testing of Statistical Hypotheses
A) Classical Method Steps
For a specified value of the proportion P0 we have (We are using the z-test on one proportion): 
1.	 State the null and alternative hypotheses:
There are three ways to set up the null and alternative Hypotheses.
a)	 Equal hypothesis versus not equal hypothesis: H0: P = P0 versus H1: P ≠ P0, two-tailed 
test.
b)	 At least versus less than: H0: P ≥ P0 versus H1: P < P0, left-tailed test.
c)	 At most versus greater than: H0: P ≤ P0 versus H1: P > P0, right-tailed test.
2.	 Let α (the most used values for the level of significance are: 0.01, or 0.05, or 0.10) be the 
significance level. Based on the three cases in step 1, we have the following three cases that 
will go along with that:
a)	 For the two tailed test there are two critical values: -Zα/2 & Zα/2, and the critical region is 
given by _=_!

in foreign countries by its citizens. It is known that in the past 35% of the country’s adult 
citizens held investment in foreign countries. The government wishes to determine if the 
current percentage of adult citizens, who own foreign investment is greater than this long term 
figure of 35%. A random sample of 800 adults is selected, and it is found that 320 of these 
citizens hold foreign assets. Is this percentage greater than 35%? Use a 10% significance level

Solution: 
Using the setup above for the classical method on testing a statistical hypothesis on one 
proportion we proceed as follows: 
1.	 H0: P ≤ 0.35 Versus	 H1: P > .35. This is a right–tailed test. (It is 1-Prop Z test on TI-84).
2.	 The level of significance is given to be 10%, or 0.10. Thus α = 0.10. Since the test is one-
tailed, on the right side, we have one critical value given by: C.V. = Zα = Z0.10 = 1.282 and 
the rejection region is given by: Z > 1.282.

Testing of Statistical Hypotheses
5.	 How to calculate the p-value for your test? Based on the test type stated in Step 1, we have 
the following options: 
a)	 For the 2-tailed test, and after calculating the value of the test statistic, Zcal in step 4, the 
p- value is found by: p-value = 2 *P (Z < Zcal), or p-value = 2 *P (Z > Zcal), conditioned 
on whether the Zcal is negative or positive. The statistical decision will be made based 
on comparing the computed p-value for the test statistic to the significance level stated in 
step 2. If the computed p-value is less than α, H0 will be rejected; otherwise do not reject 
H0.
b)	 For the left-tailed test, and after calculating the value of the test statistic, Zcal in step 4, 
the p-value is found by: p-value = P (Z < Zcal). The statistical decision will be made by 
comparing the computed p- value for the test statistic to the significance level stated in 
step 2. If the computed p-value is less than α, H0 will be rejected; otherwise do not reject 
H0.
c)	 For the right-tailed test, and after calculating the value of the test statistic, Zcal in step 
4, the p-value is found by: p-value = P (Z > Zcal). The statistical decision will be made by 
comparing the computed p- value for the test statistic to the significance level stated in 
step 2. If the computed p-value is less than α, H0 will be rejected; otherwise do not reject 
H0.
6.	 The interpretation and conclusion are due to answer the question that was raised.

Using the setup above for the p-value method on testing a statistical hypothesis on one 
proportion we proceed as follows: 
1.	 H0: P ≤ 0.35 Versus H1: P > .35. This is a right–tailed test. (It is 1-Prop Z test on TI 84).
2.	 The level of significance is given to be 10%, or 0.10. 
3.	 The test statistic is

P =

5.	 Since Zcal = 2.965. Since we have a right-tailed test, then the p-value for the test will be 
calculated by finding P (Z > 2.965). This is done by applying step No. 5. Part c) in the 
p-value method steps. Using the table for standard normal distribution we find ourselves 
trapped in rounding to two decimal places.

Figure 5
First, let us take Zcal = 2.97. Based on that we see then P (Z > 2.97) = 1–P (Z < 2.97), and from the 
Standard Normal Table, we have P (Z > 2.97) = 1–0.9985 = 0.0015 < 0.10, hence The Null hypothesis 
is rejected, See Figure 2.
Second, let us take Zcal = 2.96. Based on that we see then P (Z > 2.96) = 1–P (Z <2.96), and from Standard 
Normal Table, we have P (Z > 2.96) = 1–0.9985 = 0.0015 < 0.10, hence The Null hypothesis is rejected. 
In this case it did not make a difference whether you rounded up or down the calculated value for the 
test statistic.
Using a graphing calculator, and testing the same hypothesis, we find that the p-value, to 4 decimal 
places is, again, 0.0015. Thus the null hypothesis is rejected.

Hypothesis Testing about One Mean, μ
This section will display the procedure, by using the two methods outlined above for Testing a statistical 
hypothesis about one population mean. There are three cases to be considered in this section. Again, 
as it was stated above for one proportion, it is to be noted here that the two hypotheses are mutually 
exclusive sets on the real line for the values of the parameter, with the equal sign always set to go with 
the null hypothesis. This is so chosen in order to compute the value of the test statistics based on the 
null hypothesis being true.

Testing of Statistical Hypotheses
Case I: Testing on One Mean, μ when Population variance, σ2 known 
Classical Method Steps: For a specified value of the population mean μ0 we have (We are using the z-test): 
1.	 State the null and alternative hypotheses.
There are three ways to set up the null and alternative Hypotheses:
a)	 Equal hypothesis versus not equal hypothesis: H0: μ = μ0 versus H1: μ ≠ μ0, two-tailed 
test
b)	 At least versus less than: H0: μ ≥ μ0 versus H1: μ < μ0, left-tailed test
c)	 At most versus greater than: H0: μ ≤ μ0 versus H1: μ > μ0, right-tailed test
2.	 Let α be the significance level, and based on the three cases in step 1, we have the following 
three cases that will go along for finding the critical values and rejection regions:
a)	 For the two-tailed test there are two critical values: -Zα/2 & Zα/2, and the critical region is 
given by |Z|> Zα/2, as shown in the Figure 6, with the area on each is α/2.

Following the steps as if it were the classical method, we find that the test statistic has the value 
of -1.1839. Let us find the p-value for this left-tailed test, see Figure 10

 Figure 10
The p-value = P (Z < -1.18) for using the Standard Normal Table, we get P-value = 0.1190. It is greater 
than Alpha. We do not reject the null hypothesis. Hence we conclude that μ is not less than 50, therefore 
μ ≥ 50.
It is to be recalled that the two methods used above lead to the same conclusion. In case there is a 
contradiction between them, i.e. if you reject the Null hypothesis by using one of them while you did 
not reject the Null Hypothesis by using the other method. It is for sure you have made a mistake in one 
of them. Check it again.

Case II:	 	
Testing on One Mean, μ When Population Variance, σ2 Unknown
Since the population variance, σ2 is not known, it is traditionally reasonable to ask about the sample size. 
This is based on the earlier presentations done in Chapter 3, when we compare the standard normal 
distribution with the Student’s t-distribution. We found out there that when n, the sample size is large, 
usually n ≥ 30, is suitable to use the standard normal distribution for the test statistic involving one 
mean. Based on this discussion we have two cases to consider.

A) large Sample Size
In this part, since the sample size is large, n ≥ 30, we will use the same procedure for testing a statistical 
hypothesis about one population mean with one change. That change will take place in calculating the 
test statistic Z, when the standard deviation of the population is replaced by that of the sample. Based

B) Small Sample Size
In this part, since the sample size is small, n < 30, we will use the same procedure for testing a statistical 
hypothesis about one population mean with one change. That change will take place in replacing Z as the 
test statistic with T, where T will have a student t-distribution with degrees of freedom ν = n-1. Based 
on that, the test statistic will be given by

Testing of Statistical Hypotheses
The t-distribution is another continuous distribution that is widely used in statistics. Because of that let 
us describe that distribution before getting to use it here.
In case I, above, we discussed testing a statistical hypothesis when the population variance was known. 
We now have another case on hand when the population variance, or the standard deviation, is unknown, 
and we have a small sample. The Z-Test discussed in Case I and Case II A) does not apply any more. 
We have to appeal for another distribution. This distribution is the t-distribution. In this case we do not 
replace σ by s anymore, and say that 
0

is normally distributed, with mean 0 and variance 1. Instead 
0
/

T

n

−
=
, and this random variable 
follows Student’s t-distribution with n-1 degrees of freedom. So, let us have the properties of the 
t-distribution as listed below.
1.	 The t-distribution is controlled by its degrees of freedom. It is different for different degrees 
of freedom.
2.	 The mean of the distribution is 0, and it is symmetric about its mean.
3.	 As it was the case with the standard normal distribution, the total area under the curve is 1.
4.	 The horizontal axis acts like a horizontal asymptote, i.e., as t increases (or decreases) without 
any bound; the graph approaches the horizontal axis but never intersects it.
5.	 Compared with the standard normal distribution, and if drawn on the same scale, we find 
that the peak for standard normal distribution is higher than that of the t-distribution. This 
makes the tails for the t-distribution thicker than those for the standard distribution.
6.	 The variance for the t-distribution is > 1.
7.	 As the number of degrees of freedom increases (i.e. as the sample size n increases) the 
t-distribution gets closer to Z, the standard normal distribution. In this case the two curves 
for the two distributions will look almost alike. That is, and based on the law of large 
numbers, the estimator S, of σ, gets closer and closer.
When testing regarding one mean with the population variance unknown, and a small sample, the steps 
in the classical and the p-value methods look almost the same as in the cases discussed above, but for 
more clarity and consistency we will list the steps here again.

Classical Method Steps: For a specified value of the population mean μ0 we have (We are using the 
T-test on one mean): 
1.	 State the null and alternative hypotheses:
There are three ways to set up the null and the alternative Hypotheses.
a)	 Equal hypothesis versus not equal hypothesis: H0: μ = μ0 versus H1: μ ≠ μ0, two-tailed test
b)	 At least versus less than: H0: μ ≥ μ0 versus H1: μ < μ0, left-tailed test
c)	 At most versus greater than: H0: μ ≤ μ0 versus H1: μ > μ0, right-tailed test
It is to be noted here that the two hypotheses are mutually exclusive sets on the real line for the values 
of the parameter, with the equal sign always set to go with the null hypothesis. This is so chosen in order 
to compute the value of the test statistics based on the null hypothesis being true.
2.	 Let α be the significance level for the test. Based on the three cases in step 1, we have the 
following three cases that will go along, for finding the critical value(s)and the rejection 
region(s)
a)	 For the two tailed test there are two critical values: -tα/2 & tα/2, and the critical region is 
given by |T|> tα, as shown in the figure.
b)	 For the left tailed test, there is the critical value of -ta , and the rejection region is given 
by T < -tα, as shown in the figure.
c)	 For the right tailed test, again, there is on critical value given by tα, and the rejection 
region is T > tα, as shown in the figure.

data.
5.	 The statistical decision will be made based on the case on hand whether we have a two-
tailed, a left-tailed or a right-tailed test, by comparing the computed value of the test statistic 
to the critical value based on the test being chosen.
6.	 The interpretation and conclusion are due to answer the question that was raised.
In order to complete the picture, as before, let us list the steps in testing a statistical hypothesis regarding 
one mean when the population variance is unknown by using the p-value method.

5.	 Apply how the p-value is calculated based on the type of your test, as shown above. In this 
case we need to use the t-value that was found in step 4, instead of the z-value, since we 
have a T-test now. The statistical decision will be made based on the case on hand whether 
we have a two-tailed, a left-tailed or a right-tailed test, by comparing the computed p-value 
for the test statistic to the significance level stated in step 2. If the computed p-value is less 
than α, H0 will be rejected; otherwise do not reject H0.
6.	 The interpretation and conclusion are due to answer the question that was raised.
It is to be noted here that the p-value cannot be precisely found from the Tables as it as the case with 
Z-Test. By using the T-Table, we can put a range on the p-value only, while with technology the value 
will be given by the program used.
EXAMPLE 4.5
A colony of laboratory mice consisted of several hundred animals. Their average weight was 
believed to 30 gm. An experiment was conducted to check on this belief. A simple random 
sample of 25 animals was taken. The average weight for this sample turned up to be 33 grams 
with a sample standard deviation of 5 gm. What conclusion can be made using if the level of 
significance will be 5%?
Solution:
Using the classical method steps for testing on one mean, using the T-test, we have:
1.	 H0: μ = 30 versus H1: μ ≠ 30, Two-tailed test.
2.	 It is assumed that the significance level is 0.05. Since we have a two-tailed test, we have the 
following critical values and the corresponding Rejection regions.

Hypothesis Testing about One variance
Testing a statistical hypothesis about a population variance, or standard deviation, is surely different from 
testing about one population mean or proportion. The difference lies in the distribution of the statistic 
involved in the test. The statistic we are talking about here is the sample variance, or standard deviation, 
and its distribution. The test on one population variance is carried out based on the interest to check on 
the variability in the population. As it was the case in finding the confidence interval for one variance, 
we appealed to the random variable for the statistic given by
2
c
=

.
This Random variable has a chi-squared distribution with n-1 degrees of freedom, and S2 is the sample 
variance, σ2 is the population variance, and n is the sample size. (See the properties of the Chi-squared 
distribution set up in Chapter 3).

 
When we tested on one population mean, with small sample size and unknown variance, using the t-test, 
we had to assume that the population has a normal distribution. For testing on one population variance 
we will need the same condition, i.e., the sampled population needs to have a normal distribution. As it 
was the case on one population mean or proportion, we can use either the classical or the p-value method, 
with the one restriction that we will consider only the right-tailed test. This is because we like to check 
on the large value of the variance, in other words, we like to check on a high variation in the population.

Testing of Statistical Hypotheses
Let X1, X2,…, Xn be a simple random sample of size n from a normal population with mean μ and variance 
σ2. The steps for the statistical test on σ2, for a specified value of the population variance σ2 are as follows:
Classical Method Steps: 
1.	 State the null and alternative hypotheses:
There are three ways to set up the null and the alternative Hypotheses.
a)	 Equal hypothesis versus not equal hypothesis: H0: σ2= σ0
2 versus H1: σ2 ≠ σ0
2, two-tailed 
test
b)	 At least versus less than: H0: σ2 ≥ σ0
2 versus H1: σ2 < σ0
2, left-tailed test
c)	 at most versus greater than: H0: σ2 ≤ σ0
2 versus H1: σ2 > σ0
2, right-tailed test
2.	 Let α  be the significance level. Based on the three cases in step 1, we have the following 
three cases that will go along to calculate the critical values and the rejection regions.
a)	 For the two tailed test there are two critical values: 
2

4.	 The above test statistic is computed based on the information provided to us by the sample 
data.
5.	 The statistical decision will be made based on the case on hand whether we have a two-
tailed, a left-tailed or a right-tailed test, by comparing the computed value of the test statistic 
to the critical value based on the test being chosen.
6.	 The interpretation and conclusion are due to answer the question that was raised.
It is needless to say that the P-value method steps can be applied to test on one variance. The difficulty 
lies in finding the exact value of the p-value. As it was the case with t-test, there would be range of 
values on the p-value. However, if a software program is used, in either the T-Test on one mean, or the 
Chi-square test on one variance, the v p-value will be calculated exactly.
EXAMPLE 4.7
Consider a random sample of size 15 is taken from a normal population, that yielded S2 = 3. 
Test whether σ > 1, by using a) the classical method, b) the p-value method, by taking the 
significance level of 0.05.
Solution: 
a) Using the classical method steps for testing the hypothesis on one variance we have:
1.	 H0: σ2 ≤1 versus H1: σ2 > 1, right-tailed test.
2.	 α = 0.05, n = 15, ν =14, we see that the critical value is 
2
0.05
c
= 23.685, Thus the rejection 
region is given by

c >23.685.
3.	 The test statistic is

c =

4.	 The calculated value of the test statistic is 126.
5.	 Since the calculated value of the test statistic is > 23.685, H0 is rejected.
7.	 We conclude that σ2 > 1 and thus σ > 1.
b) By using the P-value Method, we have 
1.	 H0: σ2 ≤1 versus H1: σ2 > 1, right-tailed test.
2.	 α = 0.05
3.	 The test statistic is

5.	 We need to calculate the p-value. From the Chi-square table it is hard to find exactly 
how much the p-value is. Never the less we can put a range on the p value. How? Since 
the degrees of freedom = 14, and our test statistic value is 126, we go look along 14 for a 
number close to, or greater than, 126. Doing so we find the largest value in the table along 
14 degrees of freedom is 31.319, which fall under 0.005, in the Table. Hence the P-value  
is < 0.005 < 0.05, and H0 is rejected.
On the other hand, using a graphing calculator, we find that the p-value will be given precisely as

Testing of Statistical Hypotheses
4.5.1 Tests about two proportions, P1 – P2.
The populations’ parameters which are of interest in this section are the populations’ proportions. In 
section 4.4.1, we discussed inference regarding one population proportion. We will now tackle the 
question how to run a statistical hypothesis testing on two populations’ proportions. To conduct inference 
about two population proportions, we must first determine the sampling distribution of the difference 
of two proportions. Recall that the best point estimate of p, the proportion of the population with a 
certain characteristic, is given by 
p) = x/n,
where x is the number of individuals in the sample with the specified characteristic of interest and n is 
the sample size. Recall from Chapter 3 that the sampling distribution of p)  is approximately normal, 
with mean

is normally distributed, with mean 0 and standard deviation 1. Using this information along with 
the independence of the two samples taken from two different populations, we obtain the sampling 
distribution of the difference between two proportions. Let us set the sampling distribution for P1 – P2. 
Suppose that two simple random samples were taken from two different populations with proportions 
of P1 and P2, for a certain property that we are interested in. The First sample is of size n1 that 
produced x individuals having that interesting characteristic, while sample 2 is of size n2 that produced y 
individuals having the specified characteristic. Thus the sampling distribution of

When comparing two population proportions, the null hypothesis will always have the equal sign with

about the difference between two population proportions. We start with the Classical Method.
Classical Method Steps: We are using the z-test on two proportions (2-prop Z-Test): 
1.	 State the null and alternative hypotheses:
There are three ways to set up the null and the alternative Hypotheses.
a)	 Equal hypothesis versus not equal hypothesis: H0: P1 = P2 versus H1: P1 ≠ P2, two-tailed

b)	 At least versus less than: H0: P1 ≥ P2 versus H1: P1 < P2, left-tailed test.
c)	 At most versus greater than: H0: P1 ≤ P2 versus H1: P1 > P2, right-tailed test.
2.	 Let α be the significance level. Based on the three cases in step 1, we have the following 
three cases that will go along for finding the critical values and rejection regions.
a)	 For the two tailed test there are two critical values: -Zα/2 & Zα/2, and the critical region is 
given by |Z|>Zα/2, as shown in the Figure 1.
b)	 For the left tailed test, there is the critical value of -Zα, and the rejection region is given 
by Z < -Zα, as shown in the Figure 2.
c)	 For the right tailed test, again, there is on critical value given by Zα, and the rejection 
region is Z > Zα, as shown in the Figure 3.

5.	 How to calculate the p-value for your test? Based on the test type stated in Step 1. above, we 
have the following options:
a)	 For the 2-tailed test, and after calculating the value of the test statistic, Zcal in step 4, the 
p-value is found by: p-value = 2*P(Z < Zcal) or p-value = 2*P(Z > Zcal), conditioned on 
whether the Zcal that is negative or positive. The statistical decision will be made based by 
comparing the computed p- value for the test statistic to the significance level stated in step 
2. If the computed p-value is less than α, H0 will be rejected; otherwise do not reject H0.
b)	 For the left-tailed test, and after calculating the value of the test statistic, Zcal in step 4, 
the p-value is found by: p-value = P (Z < Zcal). The statistical decision will be made by 
comparing the computed p- value for the test statistic to the significance level stated in 
step 2. If the computed p-value is less than α, H0 will be rejected; otherwise do not reject H0.
c)	 For the right-tailed test, and after calculating the value of the test statistic, Zcal in step 
4, the p-value is found by: p-value = P (Z > Zcal). The statistical decision will be made by 
comparing the computed p- value for the test statistic to the significance level stated in 
step 2. If the computed p-value is less than α, H0 will be rejected; otherwise do not reject H0.
6.	  The interpretation and conclusion are due to answer the question that was raised.
EXAMPLE 4.8
In clinical trials of testing a certain drug, before it is released for the public, 3800 adults were 
randomly divided into two groups. The patients in Group 1 (Experimental group) received 200 
mg of the drug, while the patients in group 2 (control group) received a placebo. Out of the 
2100 patients in the experimental group, 550 reported headache as a side effect. Of the 1700 
patients in the control group 370 reported headaches as a side effect. Is there significant evidence 
to support the claim that the proportion of the drug users that experienced headaches as a side 
effect is greater than the proportion in the control group at the α = 0.05 level of significance.

method second. So we have:

2.	 α = 0.05 is the level of significance. The Critical value is

P1 ≤ P2 is rejected, and H1: P1 > P2 is being supported.
6.	 There is sufficient evidence at the α = 0.05 level of significance to support the claim that

5.	 How to calculate the p-value for your test? Based on the test type stated in Step 1, we have 
a right-tailed test, then the p-value is found by: p-value = P (Z > Zcal) = P(Z > 3.1668) = 
0.0007706. Since the computed p-value is less than α, H0 is rejected, and H1: P1 > P2 is being 
supported.

proportion of adults taking 200 mg of the drug who experienced headaches is greater than

Testing of Statistical Hypotheses
4.5.2	
Tests about Two Means, μ1-μ2.
A) populations variances known
In this section we will discuss, and display, the procedure for testing a statistical hypothesis about 
two populations’ parameters. The populations parameters which are of interest in this section are the 
populations means, μ1 and μ2. To perform inference about the difference between two means, we must 
first check if the two samples on hand had been taken as independent or dependent samples. A sampling 
method is independent when the individuals in one sample do not dictate which individuals are to be 
taken for the second sample. A sampling method is dependent when the individuals selected to represent 
the first population are used to determine the individuals to be included in the second sample that is 
representing the second population. The interest, in this section, lies in the difference between those 
two means for two populations when the samples have been taken independently. The case when the 
sampling had been dependent will be discussed under another section later.
We will give below the systematic steps in the two methods for testing a hypothesis, namely: the classical 
method and the p-value method. (For a calculator, this is the 2-sample z-test)
Classical Method Steps: 
1.	 State the null and alternative hypotheses:
There are three ways to set up the null and alternative Hypotheses.
a)	 Equal hypothesis versus not equal hypothesis: H0: μ1 = μ2 versus H1: μ1 ≠ μ2, two-tailed 
test.
b)	 At least versus less than: H0: μ1 ≥ μ2 versus H1: μ1 <μ2, left-tailed test.
c)	 at most versus greater than: H0: μ1 ≤ μ2 versus H1: μ1 > μ2, right-tailed test.
2.	 Let α be the significance level. Based on the three cases in step 1, we have the following 
three cases that will go along to find the critical values and the rejection regions for the test
a)	 For the two tailed test there are two critical values: -Zα/2 & Zα/2, and the critical region is 
given by |Z|> Zα/2, as shown in the figure.
b)	 For the left tailed test, there is the critical value of -Zα, and the rejection region is given 
by Z < -Zα, as shown in the figure.
c)	 For the right tailed test, again, there is on critical value given by Zα, and the rejection 
region is Z > Zα, as shown in the figure.

Testing of Statistical Hypotheses
4.	 The above test statistic is computed based on the information provided to us by the sample 
data.
5.	 The statistical decision will be made based on the case on hand whether we have a two-
tailed, a left-tailed or a right-tailed test, by comparing the computed value of the test statistic 
to the critical value based on the test being chosen.
6.	 The interpretation and conclusion are due to answer the question that was raised.
P-value Method Steps: (We are using the 2-sample z-test on the difference between two means). 
The steps go like this:
1.	 State the null and alternative hypotheses:
There are three ways to set up the null and the alternative Hypotheses.
a)	 Equal hypothesis versus not equal hypothesis: H0: μ1 =μ2 versus H1: μ1 ≠ μ2, Two-tailed 
test
b)	 At least versus less than: H0: μ1 ≥ μ2 versus H1: μ1 < μ2, Left-tailed test
c)	 at most versus greater than: H0: μ1 ≤ μ2 versus H1: μ1 > μ2, right-tailed test
2.	 Let α = 0.05, and based on the three cases in step 1, we have the following three cases that 
will go along
a)	 For the two tailed test there are two critical values: -Zα/2 & Zα/2, and the critical region is 
given by |Z| > Zα/2, 
b)	 For the left tailed test, there is the critical value of -Zα, and the rejection region is given 
by Z < -Zα, 
c)	 For the right tailed test, again, there is on critical value given by Zα, and the rejection 
region is Z > Zα,

statistical decision will be made based on the case on hand whether we have a two-tailed, 
a left-tailed or a right-tailed test, by comparing the computed p- value for the test statistic 
to the significance level stated in step 2. If the computed p-value is less than α, H0 will be 
rejected; otherwise do not reject H0.

6.	 The two populations have the same mean.
 
Note: The above test could have been carried using the p-value method, and getting the p-value=0.3690.
Thus the null hypothesis is not rejected since the p-value is greater than the significance level. 
B) Populations Variances unknown, large samples
In this situation a sample size is considered large if n ≥ 30. Populations can be assumed to be normally 
distributed with the populations means, μ1 and μ2, and populations’ variances

. We are still 
interested in the difference between the two populations’ means. 
The steps will go as it was when the population variances are known with the exception that the test 
statistic will take a different form. It is still a 2-sample z-test with the sample variances replacing the 
populations’ variances in the form for the test statistic. Hence the test statistic will have the following form:

Solution: 
We have two large samples each n > 30. We will do the p-value method on testing the difference 
between two means, with population variances unknown.

4.	 The above test statistic, based on the information provided is Z = 1.3722
5.	 Apply the p-value for the right-tailed test we see that p-value = 0.08499 >α. Hence the null 
hypothesis is rejected. 
6.	 The two population means are the equal. 
 
C) Populations Variances Unknown, Small Samples
Once more the steps in the classical method, and the p-value method, for testing on the difference between 
two means will apply here as well. However there will be two sub-cases to be considered as the samples’ 
sizes are small. Small sample are those samples with n <30. In addition to that, as it was the case with 
one mean, population variance unknown, and small sample size, the t-distribution will the underlying 
distribution for the test statistic in this case. In this section we will discuss, the procedure for testing a 
statistical hypothesis about two populations’ means, when the variances are not known. This case, by 
itself, raises the following question: (the fact that the variances are unknown), Are the variances equal, 
or they are different? Without answering this question now, but the situation is worth looking at from 
these two different sub-cases. The following discussion will address this phenomenon. 
1.	 Let us consider the case when the two populations’ variances are equal, i.e., σ1
2 =σ2
2= σ2, their 
common value. In this case we estimate this common value between the two populations’ 
variances by pooling the two variances of the two samples, and we have

H0: μ1 = μ2 versus H1: μ1 ≠ μ2 two-tailed test.
2.	 Let α = 0.05 be the significance level. In this case the degrees of freedom ν = 28. For the 
two-tailed test there are two critical values: .025,28
t
=2.048, - .025,28

region is given by |T|> .025,28

 
The second sub-case is when σ1
2 ≠ σ2
2. In this case, without testing on the equality of the two variances 
(This case is coming up later), we will use the Student’s t-distribution, but with different degrees of 
freedom. The degrees of freedom will be calculated from

for the test. This has to be done, or calculated, manually since no software will calculate the test statistic 
value based on this type of degrees of freedom. Awareness, by the reader, or the investigator, should be 
taken into consideration for what case he/she will consider.
Remark:
The interested student can check on the above example using the Welch’s Test, or the case when the 
sample variances are not pooled for the 2-sampleTTest.
4.5.3 	
Tests about Two Variances
Testing a statistical hypothesis about a population variance, or standard deviation, is surely different 
from testing about one population’s mean or proportion. The difference lies in the distribution of the 
test statistic involved in the process. The statistic we are talking about here is the sample variance, or 
standard deviation, and its distribution. The test on one population variance is carried out based on the 
interest to check on the variability in the population. As it was the case in finding the confidence interval 
for one variance, we appealed to the random variable for the test statistic given by
χ2= 
2
2
(
1)
n
S
s
−
.
This random variable has a (chi-square) χ2-distribution with n-1 degrees of freedom, and S2 is the 
sample’s variance, σ2 is the population’s variance, and n is the sample’s size. (See the properties of the 
χ2-distribution set up in Chapter 3).
When we tested on one population mean with small sample size and unknown variance, using the t-test, 
we had to assume that the population has a normal distribution. For testing on one population variance 
we will need the same condition, i.e. the sampled population needs to have a normal distribution. As 
it was the case on one population mean or proportion, we can use either the classical or the p-value 
method, with the one restriction that we will consider only the right-tailed test. This is because we like 
to check on the large value of the variance, or on a high variation in the population.

Testing of Statistical Hypotheses
Sometimes it is of interest to compare the variability (precision) of two procedures for taking measurements 
or analysis (e.g. two machines, two operators). This comparison can be carried out through comparing 
the variances, or the standard deviations, in the two procedures.
Recall the case when we tested on μ1-μ2, when the population variances were unknown, we had to 
consider the two cases whether the variances are equal, in order to pool, or not. The 2-sample T-test 
was carried out without really checking on the equality of the two populations’ variances. May be it is 
time now. We tested on one variance or one standard deviation using the Chi-square test give by the 
random variable defined as above in 4.4.5.
Let X1, X2, …, Xn be a simple random sample of size n from a normal population with mean μ1 and 
variance σ1
2. Also let Y1, Y2,…, Ym be another simple random sample from another normal population 
with mean μ2 and variance σ2

Testing of Statistical Hypotheses
Classical Method Steps: One more time the steps will go as follows:
1.	 State the null and alternative hypotheses:
There are three ways to set up the null and alternative Hypotheses.
a)	 Equal hypothesis versus not equal hypothesis: H0: σ1
2 = σ2
2 versus H1: σ1
2 ≠ σ2
2 two-tailed 
test.
b)	 At least versus less than: H0: σ1
2 ≥ σ2
2 versus H1: σ1
2 < σ2
2, left-tailed test.
c)	 at most versus greater than: H0: σ1
2 ≤ σ2
2 versus H1: σ1
2 > σ2
2, right-tailed test
2.	 Let α be the significance level, and based on the three cases in step 1, we have the following 
three cases that will go along in order to find the critical values and the rejection region.
a)	 For the two tailed test there are two critical values: 
1

5.	 The statistical decision will be made based on the case on hand whether we have a two-
tailed, a left-tailed or a right-tailed test, by comparing the computed value of the test statistic 
to the critical value based on the test being chosen.
6.	 The interpretation and conclusion are due to answer the question that was raised.
EXAMPLE 4.12
A company produces machined engine parts that are supposed to have a diameter variance 
no larger than 0.0002 (diameters are measured in inches). The company wishes to compare 
the variation in diameters produced by the company with the variation in diameters parts 
produced by another competitor. Our company had a sample of size n=10 that produced a 
sample variance S1
2= 0.0003. In contrast, the sample variance of the diameter measurements 
for 20 of the competitor’s parts was S2
2 = 0.0001. Do the data provide sufficient information to 
indicate a smaller variation in diameters for the competitor? Test with α = 0.05, by using the 
classical method.

Testing of Statistical Hypotheses
Solution:
1.	 H0: σ1
2 ≤ σ2
2 versus H1: σ1
2 > σ2
2, right-tailed test
2.	 α = 0.05, and 
1n =10, 
1n -1= 9, 
2n =20, 
2n -1 = 19. Thus we have an F-distribution with 9 
and 19 degrees of freedom for the numerator and denominator respectively, the CV is given 
by F (9, 19; .05) = 2.42. Moreover, the rejection region is given by F > 2.42.
3.	 The Test statistic is given by (since under H0 σ1
2 = σ2
2) F =

S
4.	 The observed value of the test statistic, based on what we have on hand, is F = 3.
5.	 We see that F > F (9, 19; .05), therefore at the α = 0.05 level of significance, we reject the null 
hypothesis H0: σ1
2 ≤ σ2
2 in favor of the alternative hypothesis, namely H1: σ1
2 > σ2
2.
6.	 We conclude that the competitor produces parts with smaller variation in their diameters.
 
Remark 
Recall that it is not easily, by using the table for the F-distribution, to pin point the p-value for the test. 
All we can do is that putting a range on the p-value.
EXAMPLE 4.13
Give the bounds on the p-value associated with the data in the above Example ###.
Solution
As it was shown, the calculated F-value for this right-tailed test is F = 3. Since this value is to 
be compared with F (9, 19; .05) = 2.42, by using the F-distribution Table for F (9, 19; .025) 
we find that F (9, 19; .025) = 2.82, whereas F (9, 19; .01) = 3.52. Hence based on the observed 
value of the F-Statistic, F = 3, would lead to the rejection of the null hypothesis for α = 0.025 
but not for α = 0.01. Therefore, we have the following of values on the p-value, which is 0.01 
< p-value < 0.025.
On the other hand, by using technology, and more specifically, TI Calculator 84-Plus, we find 
the p-value for our test is given exactly as 0.020960, a value clearly in the above cited range.

Simple Linear Regression and Correlation
5.1	
Introduction
It is quite often that the investigator likes to check how variables are related, and to “find if he can” 
a relationship among the variables on hand. An interesting question might be raised by a researcher 
such as: am I able to predict the value of a random variable if I have the value of one or more variables 
available? This kind of study is what we call regression analysis. As we know variables are two types, 
either independent or dependent, based on how the value of that variable is attained or obtained? For 
example the relationship between heights and weights of individuals, temperature and pressure, the 
weight of a fish and its breathing capacity, the annual food expenditure and the annual income of the 
family, and so on, might be of interest to the scientist. In the above examples there were two quantities, 
and we could label them as: input and output, independent and dependent, or explanatory and response. 
For example, the family income is the independent or explanatory variable while the food expenditure 
will be called the dependent or response variable.
The response variable is that variable whose value can be explained by the value of one or more 
explanatory variable or predictor variables. There are many types of regression, based on the number 
of variables involved. When we have one response and one predictor, this is the case for linear regression. 
In case we have one response and many predictor variables, this is the case of multiple regressions. In 
this chapter, we are interested in the case of two variables, and when the relationship between them 
is assumed to be a linear one. In addition to linear regression between two variables there might be 
logarithmic, exponential, quadratic, cubic, and so on regression.
The purpose of regression analysis is to determine the existence, the kind, or the extent of a relationship 
(in the form of a mathematical equation) between two or more variables. For example, if x and y denote 
two variables under study, then, in general, we want to determine the best equation (relation) y = f(x) 
that describes the relationship between x and y.
The term “regression” goes back to Sir Francis Galton. In his work on hereditary, Galton noted that the 
sons of very tall fathers tended to be tall, but not quite as tall as their fathers. Also, sons of very short 
fathers tended to be short, but not quite as short as their fathers. He called this tendency, of individuals 
to be not quite tall or as short as their fathers, the tendency of “regression toward mediocrity”, i.e., going 
back to the average, see exercise 5.15.
In much of the experimental work, it is desired to investigate how the changes in one variable affect 
another variable, or introduce some changes in that variable. One can distinguish between exact and 
non-exact relationships. (See Draper and Smith, pp. 4–6).

Simple Linear Regression and Correlation
5.1.1	
Exact Relationship
Sometimes we find that two variables are linked by an exact relationship. For example, if the resistance 
“R” of a simple circuit is kept constant, the current “I” is related to the voltage “V” by Ohm’s Law: I = V/R, 
which is an equation of first degree and the graph of it is a straight line. This is an exact law. However, 
if we want to verify it empirically by making changes in V and observing I while R is kept constant we 
notice that the plot of the empirical points (V, I) will not fall exactly on a straight line. The reason is 
that the measurements may be subject to slight errors and thus the plotted points would not fall exactly 
on the straight line but would vary randomly around it. For purposes of predicting the value for I for a 
particular value for V (with R as a fixed constant) we should use the plotted straight line.
5.1.2	
Non-Exact Relationship
Sometimes the relationship is not exact even apart from the errors in measurements. For example, 
suppose we consider the height and weight of adult males for some population. If we plot the ordered pair  
(weight, height) = (x, y), a diagram, like Figure 1 below, will result. Such a representation is conventionally 
called a scatter diagram.

Figure 1
Note that for any given height there is a range of observed weights and vice versa. This variation will be 
partially due to measurement errors but primarily due to variation among individuals. If you consider 
two males with same height, their weights will be different not only because we cannot measure the 
weights exactly correct, but also because the two males will have slight different weights. Thus no unique 
relationship between the actual weight and height can be written. But we can notice that the average 
observed weight, for a given observed height, increases as height increases. Whether a relationship is 
exact or non-exact, in so far as average values are concerned, it will be useful especially for prediction 
purposes.

Simple Linear Regression and Correlation
It is not always clear which variable should be considered the response variable and which the explanatory 
variable. For example, does high school GPA predict a student’s SAT score or can the SAT score be used 
to predict the student’s GPA? The investigator should determine which variable plays the role of the 
explanatory variable based on the question that needs to be answered.
Scatter Diagrams show the type of the relation that exists between two variables. By plotting the 
explanatory variable along the horizontal axis and the response along the vertical axis, our goal is to 
distinguish which scatter diagrams will imply a linear relation from those that will imply a nonlinear 
relation and those that imply no relation. Figure 2 and Figure 3 show some scatter diagrams and the 
type of relation implied.

Figure 4
Figure 4, above, shows the type of linear and nonlinear relationships between two variables. 
In Figure 4A we see a perfect negative linear relationship, and we say that the two variables are negatively 
associated. In other words, two variables are negatively associated if, whenever the value of one variable 
increases, the value of the other variable decreases. 
On the other hand, Figure 4B shows that there are two variables that are linearly related and positively 
associated. In the same vein, two variables are positively associated if, whenever the value of one variable 
increases, the value of the other variable increases. 
The situation is quite different in Figure 4C. There is the case where we see a horizontal line, although 
it is linear, but the response variable, Y, is not affected by the change in the explanatory variable, x. Thus 
Y = a constant. 
Figure 4D shows a non-linear relationship between the two variables x and y.
Figure 4 displays ideal cases for positively and negatively associated variables based on a linear relationship 
between the two. In section 5.4 we will check on the strength of that linear relationship between the 
explanatory variable x and the response variable Y.

Simple Linear Regression and Correlation
Where the response variable, y, depends on one regressor, or explanatory, variable, x, and the equation 
is a polynomial of the first degree in x. This model is called the simple first degree model. β0 and β1 
are unknown constants, called the parameters of the model. Specifically, β0 is the y-intercept and β1 
is called the regression coefficient, or the slope of the line. The symbol E denotes a random error (the 
model error), which will be assumed to have a normal distribution with mean 0 and variance σ2. The 
first order model (or the straight line relationship between the response and the explanatory variables) 
can be valuable in many situations. The relationship may actually be a straight line relationship as in 
the example on Ohm’s law. Even if the relationship is not actually of the first order (or linear), it may 
be approximated by a straight line at least over some range of the input data. In the Figure 5 below, the 
relationship between x and y is obviously nonlinear over the range 0 < x < 100. However, if we were 
interested primarily in the range 0 < x < 25, a straight line relationship evaluated, on observations in 
this range, might provide a perfectly adequate representation of the function. Hence the relationship 
that just got fitted would not apply to values of x beyond the restricted range and could not be used for 
predictive purposes outside that range.

 Fitting a straight line (First order Model)
The first order model given by 
y = β0 + β1x + e,
has the unknown parameters β0 and β1, that need to be estimated in order to use the relationship for 
prediction. Thus a sample of size n of ordered observations (x1, y1), (x2, y2), … , (xn, yn), will be used 
to estimate those two parameters. The estimators of those two parameters will be denoted by b0 and b1 
respectively, and hence we will have the following equation 
ŷ = b0 + b1x.
In the notation, above, ŷ is used in the least squares regression line to serve as a predicted value of y for 
a given value of x. It is worth noting that the least squares line contains the point ( , )
x y , where

Where 
ie  is the value assumed by Ei when Yi takes on the value yi. The above equation can be viewed 
as the model for a single observation yi. Similarly, using the estimated, or fitted regression line 
ŷ = b0 + b1x.
Each pair of observations satisfies the relation
yi = β0 + β1xi + ei,
Where ei = yi – ŷ1 is called a residual and describes the error in the fit of the model at the ith data point 
or observation.
We shall find b0 and b1, the estimates of β0 and β1, so that the sum of the squares of the residuals is a 
minimum. The residual sum of squares is often called the sum of squares of the errors about the regression 
line and denoted by SSE. This minimization procedure for estimating the parameters is called the Method 
of Least-Squares. Thus we shall find b0 and b1 so as to minimize

(The interested reader, who is aware of differential calculus, can check the procedure in R.E. Walpole, and

regression line is the line that minimizes the square of the vertical distance between the observed values of 
Y and those predicted by the line, ŷ. Thus solving the normal equations resulting from the differentiation 
of the SSE, we see that

EXAMPLE 5.1:
The following measurements of the specific heat of a certain chemical were made in order to 
investigate the variation in specific heat with temperature:

Estimate the regression line of specific heat on temperature, and predict the value of the specific 
heat when the temperature is 250C.

From the data we have: n = 5,

b1 = 0.0028. Hence the fitted equation will be given by ŷ = 0.514 + 0.0028x. When the temperature 
x = 250C, the predicted specific heat is 0.514+0.0028*25 = 0.584.

Hence the estimated values in the predicted equation will have the following values: b0 = 13.46 and  
b1 =1.13 and the fitted equation is given by ŷ = 13.46 + 1.13x, where x is the coded year.
To predict the output for the year 1965, we take x = 3, which is its coded value, in the predicting equation, 
to obtain ŷ = 13.46 + 1.13*3 = 16.85 or 16850 tons.

EXAMPLE 5.3: (Non-linear Model)
The importance of the linear relationship (or the first order model) goes beyond the cases 
where the linearity is apparent. Some relationships are not linear to start with, but they can 
be linearized easily. For example consider the experiment growth (or Decay, when the rate is 
negative) model: 
P = Aert.u,
Where P is the population size at time t, A is the population size at time zero (a constant), “r” is 
a constant representing the rate (of growth when r > 0 and decay when r < 0) and u represents 
a random error. This model describes situations when the relative growth is constant in the 
population. It can describe the growth in human or biological populations, and the growth in 
compound interest, when u =1. 
Consider the following data for the population of the USA (in millions) during the years 
1860–1900:

Solution:
The exponential growth model, displayed above, with u =1, can be transformed to a linear 
relation by taking the logarithm to base e (i.e. ln) of both sides to obtain
Ln P = Ln A + rt + Ln u, 
Which can be written as: y = β0 + β1x + E, where y = Ln P, β0 = r, x = t and E = Ln u = 0. 
Now we have a linear model, we can fit using the data given above. Moreover, by appealing 
to EXAMPLE 5.2, and coding the data, we have the following generated data in Table 2 for 
manual calculations.

Simple Linear Regression and Correlation
It is dangerous to use only a scatter diagram to check on the relation between two variables see Figure 1. 
For the sake of argument, what if someone else used a different scale for the same data and he/she 
depicted the scatter plot, will there be the same conclusion, as it was reached from Figure 1 earlier? 
Based on that, we need another tool in order to be sure we reach the same conclusion without a scatter 
plot dilemma. For that purpose we need to define The Linear Correlation Coefficient that will show 
how strong is that linear relationship between the two variables on hand.
The Linear Correlation Coefficient or Pearson Product Moment Correlation Coefficient is a measure 
of the strength of a linear relation between two quantitative variables. The Greek letter ρ (rho) is used 
to represent the population correlation coefficient and r to represent the sample correlation coefficient. 
Recall that ρ is a parameter, and thus can be estimated by a statistic. What is better than r for ρ? 
In order to keep the math background to a minimum for this course, we will give a formula for calculating 
r using the data on hand. To do that, let us recall how the z-scores (whether for a population or for a 
sample) were defined. Recall the formula for the z-scores, in words, with S being the standard deviation 
of the data set
Z-score = 
int
data po
meanof thedata set
S
−
.
Since we are dealing with two samples from the explanatory variable x and the response variable Y, then 
based on the above definition of the Z-scores we have

Simple Linear Regression and Correlation
The above formula is much more accurate for the manual calculations of r than the one given in terms 
of the Z-scores. In addition to that, any software will give a value for r faster and more accurate to as 
many decimal places as the investigator likes.
The Pearson Linear Correlation Coefficient is named in honor of Karl Pearson (1857–1936).
Let us give some properties of the Linear Correlation Coefficient.
1.	 The Linear Correlation coefficient is always between -1 and 1, inclusive. In other words, –1≤r≤1.
2.	 If r = 1, there is a perfect positive linear relation between the two variables. See Figure 4B.
3.	 If r = -1, there is a perfect negative linear relation between the two variables. See Figure 4A.
4.	 The closer r to 1, the stronger is the evidence of positive association between the two variables.
5.	 The closer r to -1, the stronger is the evidence of negative association between the two variables.
6.	 The closer r to 0, there is little or no evidence of a linear relation between the two variables. 
Never the less the closer r to 0 does not mean no relation, just no linear relation, See figure 4D 
7.	 The linear correlation coefficient is unit less, as it appeared from its definition in terms of the 
z scores, where they are unit less.
To illustrate the notions mentioned above, let us give an example. We will take small values for both x 
and y just to see how the calculations can be done.
EXAMPLE 5.4
Consider the paired data: (x, y): (2, 1.4), (4, 1.8), (8, 2.1), (8, 2.3), (9, 2.6). Calculate r.
Solution:
Aside from using Technology to find r, faster, more accurate, and less time consuming, let us 
set the stage for manual calculations by making Table 3.

It is quite clear from Table 3 that all the terms which are needed for the formula to calculate r are given. 
Thus plugging in those numerical values, we found r = 0.9572.

 Hypothesis Testing in Regression Analysis
In this section we discuss the precision of the regression coefficients, the construction of confidence 
limits, and testing the statistical hypotheses about the regression coefficients. Before proceeding we 
need to make some basic assumptions on the first order model as follows. While the model is given by
Yi = β0 +β1xi +
ie , i =1, 2, 3,…,n.
Provided that the 
ie  are independent random variables which have a normal distribution with mean 
zero and variance σ2, i.e. E (
ie ) = 0, and Var (
ie ) = σ2. This implies that
	
	
	
E(Yi ) = β0 + β1xi , 
and 
Var (Yi) = σ2, 
with the Yi’s taken as independent and normally distributed Random variables.

This decomposition shows that, of the total variation in the y’s about their mean, some of the variation 
can be ascribed to the regression line and some to the fact that the actual observations do not all lie 
exactly on a regression line. It is seen that the value of SSregr can be used as a measure of the importance 
of the fitted regression line. If SSregr is large in relative to SSresiduals, this indicates the fitted line is significant. 
One measure for the importance of regression is the “Coefficient of Determination” r2, which is given 
by r2 = SSregr / SStotal. The above sums of squares can be computed easily using the following formulas:

Simple Linear Regression and Correlation
What is that r2? It is not surprising to see that it is the square of the linear correlation coefficient found 
above, when it needs to be calculated. If r2 is found first, clearly we can find r by taking the square root. 
Another question: is r > 0 or r < 0? How do you decide? No doubt that finding r first is more enlightening 
than finding r2 first. Here is another definition.
The coefficient of determination, r2, measures the percentage of total variation in the response variable 
that is explained by the least square regression line based on the one explanatory variable x. it is a number 
between 0 and 1 inclusive, that is, 
2
0
1
r
≤
≤. Recall that r2 is the estimated value of the random variable 
R2. Practically r2- is expressed as a percentage, and it is < 100%. What about that difference percentage 
between the 100% and r2? This difference is the unexplained variation in Y due to not including all the 
variables that the response variable can get affected by.
The results are summarized in the ANOVA Table below.

Testing for Significant Regression
In the model y = β0 + β1x + e, if β1= 0, then Y is not related to x by the first linear model, i.e., this first 
order model is incorrect. However if β1 ≠ 0, then there is a linear relationship between x and y as described 
in the model. At this time we cannot tell whether the relationship is positively related, i.e. y increases 
as x increases, or negatively related, i.e., x increases then Y decreases. Thus to test for significant linear 
(first order) relationship, between x and Y is equivalent to testing the following hypotheses:
H0: β1 = 0 versus H1: β1 ≠ 0.

Using the classical method steps regarding the statistical hypothesis about the significance of 
the first order regression, we have.
1.	 H0: β1 = 0 versus H1: β1 ≠ 0, this is a two-tailed test.
2.	 Based on the level of significance α =0.05, and the F-test with 1 and 2 degrees of freedom for 
the numerator and denominator respectively, the critical value is given as 
0.95
f
= 18.51.
3.	 The test statistics is F =

MS

MS
4.	 F = 68.45/2.15 = 31.84
5.	 Since the calculated value of 31.84 > the critical value of 18.51, the null hypothesis is rejected.
6.	 It is concluded that there exists a significant linear relationship between the yield and the 
amount of fertilizer used. There is a positive, direct proportional relationship between the 
amount of fertilizer x and the yield Y.
Using the ANOVA setup above we have the following ANOVA Table
The above test procedure for the significance of the linear regression has used the ANOVA technique. 
Example 5.5 was an example on that procedure. Recall we had two methods to test on a parameter of 
the population. The steps are identical in both cases, and the difference is in the test statistic. Just for 
comparison we will list the steps for the classical and p-value methods for testing the hypothesis regarding 
the slope coefficient β1 in the least –squares regression linear model.

It is to be noted that to test the claim that two quantitative variables are linearly related, we make sure 
that the following two conditions are satisfied:
1.	 The sample is obtained using random sampling.
2.	 The residuals are normally distributed with a constant error variance.
Classical Method Steps: 
1.	 State the null and alternative hypotheses.
There are three ways to set up the null and alternative Hypotheses:
d)	 Equal hypothesis versus not equal hypothesis: H0: β1 = 0 versus H1: β1 ≠ 0, two-tailed test
e)	 At least versus less than: H0: β1 ≥ 0 versus H1: β1 < 0, left-tailed test
f)	 At most versus greater than: H0: β1 ≤ 0 versus H1: β1 > 0, right-tailed test
2.	 Let α be the significance level, and based on the three cases in step 1, we have the following 
three cases that will go along for finding the critical values and rejection regions:
a)	 For the two-tailed test there are two critical values: –tα/2 & tα/2, and the critical region 
is given by |T|> tα/2, as shown in the Figure 1, with each of the shaded areas equals 
α/2.

b)	 For the left-tailed test, there is the critical value of -tα, and the rejection region is 
given by T < -tα, and should be the one on the left side in Figure 1, 
c)	 or the right-tailed test, again, there is on critical value given by tα, and the rejection 
region is T > tα, as shown in the Figure 1, on the right side with area equals α.

, which follows Student’s t-distribution with n-2 
degrees of freedom ere n is the sample size, x is the mean, and Z has the standard normal 
distribution, N (0, 1).
4.	 The above test statistic is computed based on the information provided to us by the sample 
data, and on the assumption that the null hypothesis is true, i.e. β1 = 0.
5.	 The statistical decision will be made based on the case on hand whether we have a two-
tailed, a left-tailed or a right-tailed test, by comparing the computed value of the test statistic 
to the critical value based on the test being chosen.
6.	 The interpretation and conclusion are due to answer the question that was raised.
P-value Method Steps: For testing regarding the slope β1, we have:
1.	 State the null and alternative hypotheses :
There are three ways to set up the null and the alternative Hypotheses.
a)	 Equal hypothesis versus not equal hypothesis: H0: β1 = 0 versus H1: β1 ≠ 0, Two-tailed 
test
b)	 At least versus less than: H0: β1 ≥ 0 versus H1: β1 < 0, Left-tailed test
c)	 At most versus greater than: H0: β1 ≤ 0 versus H1: β1 > 0, right-tailed test
2.	 Let α be the significance level for the test.

5.	 Apply how the p-value is calculated based on the type of your test, as shown above. The 
statistical decision will be made based on the case on hand whether we have a two-tailed, 
a left-tailed or a right-tailed test, by comparing the computed p-value, for the test, to the 
significance level stated in step 2. If the computed p-value is less than α, H0 will be rejected; 
otherwise do not reject H0. Using the T-Test, and technology we can have an exact value for 
the p-value, but only a range of values on it if things are done manually and based on the 
tables. 
6.	 The interpretation and conclusion are due to answer the question that was raised.
EXAMPLE 5.6
Based on data in EXAMPLE 5.5, test the significance of the least-squares regression linear 
model. Apply the above techniques with the LinRegTTest.
Solution:
Following Technology – Step-by-Step for testing on the significance of the linear model in 
Example 5.5, we have the following output.

r = 0.969997
On applying the classical method with level of significance of 0.05, df = 4-2 = 2, and two-tailed test, the 
critical values are ± 4.303, and the rejection region is given by |T| > 4.303. From the output above we 
see that the calculated value of the test statistic is > the critical value, thus it is in the rejection region. 
So, the null hypothesis is rejected, and the two variable are positively associated since r > 0.

Applying the p-value method, based on the practical significance level of 0.03000 < 0.05, and therefore 
the null hypothesis is rejected.
The conclusions just reached are in line with the conclusion that was based on the ANOVA and the F-Test.

 Confidence Interval on β0 and β1
As it was the case when we constructed a confidence interval on one parameter of the population (i.e. on 
one proportion, or one mean, or one variance) or on two parameters of the population, we can construct 
a confidence interval on the coefficients in the least squares regression line, namely, the parameters β0 
and β1. Clearly, those parameters needed to be estimated by b0 and b1 respectively. We refer the interested 
reader, for the proofs and realization of the following formulas, to Walpole and Myers. Thus we have
E (b0) = β0, Var (b0) =

For more C.I. on the mean of the response variable at a given value for the explanatory variable, or for 
a C.I. for the regression line at a given x value or for a C.I. on a predicted single y value at a specified 
x value, we refer the interested reader to Bakir and Shayib 1990, pp. 172–176. In addition to the above 
the interested reader can check that the random variable T2 has an F-distribution.
From the model : y = β0 + β1x + e, again for the sake of completion, with the usual assumptions for the 
E’s that are independent random variables with mean zero and variance σ2, let us give, without derivation, 
the 100(1 –α) % C.I. for a mean response, i.e. on E(Y) =

Simple Linear Regression and Correlation
The procedure for obtaining a prediction interval for an individual response is identical to that for finding 
a C.I. on the mean of that response. The difference is in the standard error. More variability is associated 
with one value than with the mean of some values. The following formula can be used to construct a 
prediction interval for a predicted y value at a specified x-value, x = x0.

Introduction
For example; are children born equally on the days of the week? When rolling a die, how do you check 
if that die is fair? 
In the previous chapters we have seen how to 
1.	 	Collect, organize, summarize and analyze data
2.	 Test statistical hypotheses concerning population means, populations’ proportions, and 
populations’ variances.
The idea of testing statistical hypotheses can be extended to other situations that involve different 
parameters and use different test statistics. Whereas the standardized test statistics that appeared in earlier 
chapters followed either a normal, Student t-distribution Chi-square tests, in this chapter the tests will 
involve two other very common and useful distributions, the chi-square and the F-distributions. The 
chi-square distribution a particular probability distribution specified by a number of degrees of freedom, 
df, arises in tests of hypotheses concerning the independence of two random variables and concerning 
whether a discrete random variable follows a specified distribution, that is, testing on goodness of fit to 
some assumptions. The F-distribution, a particular probability distribution specified by two degrees of 
freedom, df1 and df2 arises in tests of hypotheses concerning the equality if two populations’ variances 
are equal. It is also used in testing statistical hypotheses concerning whether, or not, three or more 
populations’ means are equal.
In Chapter 4 we discussed procedures for testing a statistical hypothesis about one population parameter, 
or two populations’ parameters. In chapter 6, we seek an extension of the previously described procedures 
to test statistical hypotheses about three or more means. The extended procedure, to do this testing, is 
called Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). In general, we call the variability among the sample means the 
between-sample variability and the variability of each sample the within-sample variability. ANOVA 
works by comparing the variability between the samples to the variability within the samples. To carry 
out such a task, we need to introduce, and learn about, a new distribution, the F-distribution.
The F distribution was named in honor of the “grandfather of Statistics,” Sir Ronal A. Fisher. The F 
distribution is like the Chi-square distribution, it is right-skewed, a non-negative, and has an infinite 
number of F curves. It is characterized by the degrees of freedom of the numerator and the denominator 
that can take infinite values, theoretically speaking. The resemblance between the F and the Chi-Square 
distributions is not surprising since, as we will find out later, that the F distribution is a ratio of two 
chi-square distributions with degrees of freedom df1 for the numerator and df2 for the denominator.

Other Tests and Analysis Of Variance
Properties of the F Distribution
1.	 The total area under the F-distribution curve equals 1.
2.	 The value of the F random variable is never negative, so the F curve starts at 0. However, it 
extends indefinitely to the right,
3.	 The curve never intersects the horizontal axis. The horizontal axis acts as a horizontal 
asymptote for the F-distribution curve.
4.	 Because of the property 2, the distribution is positively skewed, or right-skewed.
5.	 There is a different F-distribution curve for each pair of the degrees of freedom, df1 and df2, 
the degrees of freedom of the numerator and the degrees of freedom of the denominator, 
respectively.
6.	 The F-distribution is continuous, and thus we find probabilities associated with the values 
of F, as areas under the curve and between any two specified points on the horizontal axis 
within the range of values for the random variable, just as we did with the normal, t-, and 
chi-square distributions.
7.	 Let U and V be independent Chi-square random variables with r1 and r2 degrees of freedom, 
respectively, then the random variable is defined by

2

U r
F
V

This random variable will have an F-distribution with r1 degrees of freedom for the numerator, 
and r2 degrees of freedom for the denominator. Based on that, we write F(r1, r2). Clearly the 
reciprocal of F,

will be another F-distribution but with reversed degrees of freedom, with regard to the original 
F-distribution. It is given by F(r2, r1).

Figure 1 displays an F-distribution with different degrees of freedom for the numerator and denominator. 
As it is clear from the graph, the F-distribution is positively skewed. For large degrees of freedom, the 
graph will have a high peak, and a very thin right tail.
In section 6.2 the Goodness-Of-Fit will be introduced. The test for independence and Homogeneity 
of proportions will be discussed in 6.3. In section 6.4, below, we will introduce the one-way ANOVA. 
We will restrict ourselves to the simplest case of ANOVA when comparing a set of “J” treatments with 
no restriction on randomization. This presentation will use the linear model in its two forms, as it will 
become clear later.
6.2	
Goodness-of-Fit Tests
Data, or measurements from experiments, can be qualitative or categorical rather than quantitative 
like many of the measurements discussed in the earlier chapters. Earlier we have dealt mostly with 
quantitative data, for estimating the perameters of the populations, finding confidence intervals about 
them and testing statistical hypotheses concerning those parameters as well. When data comes in, and 
it is summarized in categories, or classes, the measurements will be given as counts that fall in each of 
the distinct categories associated with the varable. For Example
•	 Employees may be classified into one of five income brackets.
•	 Faculty members at any institution can be classified in more than 3 categories.
•	 Cars might fall into one of 4 or 5 types of vehicles.

In this section, we like to answer the question just raised in the first sentence in this chapter: How do we 
check if a die is fair? In chapter 2 we considered discrete random variables and especially the binomial 
random variable where there are only two possible outcomes for the experiment. As example for the 
binomial random variable is this question again: Asking the students individually: Did you have eggs 
this morning for breakfast? We are not interested in how did he/she have their eggs, as much we are 
concerned about whether the answer is Yes or No. On the other hand, if the question was put in this 
way: What did have for breakfast this morning? Clearly there are more than two choices for the answer. 
Now let us consider the following type of random variable that will go with the question just been asked, 
i.e. a question which can have more than two possible values. Hence we are defining what is called a 
Multinomial Random Variable.
A Multinomial Random Variable is that variable which satisfies the following conditions:
a)	 Each independent trial of the experiment has k possible outcomes, k = 3, 4, …
b)	 The ith outcome occurs with probability ݌௜!L «N (that is is the population 
proportion for the ith outcome, or category.
c)	 ݌௜  (by the law of total probability).
Data from a multinomial random variable will be labeled as following a multinomial distribution.
EXAMPLE 6.1
In a class of 40 students taking stat 1350, there was the following question: What is your 
political affiliation?
Solution: 
The answer is a multinomial random variable since the answere could be; Republican, Democrat, 
Independent, TEA party, or others (No affiliation). Clearly this is a multinomial data. If in the 
class of 40 students we have 10 Rerublicans, 12 democrats, 8 independent, 5 TEA Party, and 
5 with no affiliation. Hence we have, based on k = 5, we see that

Is the class above a good representative of the population in the USA? If those proportions are correct 
throughout the nation then a class of 60 students will be composed of how many of each political 
category? Recall how did we find the mean of a binomial random variable? Is it binomial here? Yes, it 
is as far as each category is concerned. If you ask are a republican? That is a binomial Random variable 
with two outcomes; yes or no. Thus the expected value in this case will be: The Number of trials * the 
proportion of being a republican = np. To check the validity of this claim, we will introduce a new test 
called Chi-Square, χ2 Goodness Of-Fit-Test.
A χ2 Goodness of fit test is a statistical hypothesis test used to determine whether a random variable 
follows a particular distribution or not. In this case the two Hypotheses will be stated as follows:
H0: The random variable follows a particular distribution, i.e. with specified and assigned values 
for the probabilities of the categories,
H1: The random variable does not follow the particular distribution stated in.
In statistics, a goodness of fit test checks on a collection of data, in categories, to see if that data falls 
according to a specified probability distribution. The data collected is a sample, and we use the goodness 
of fit test to see if the sample is consistent with the null hypothesis. The sample will be summarized in a 
set of “observed” frequencies under the categories of interest. The χ2 Goodness of fit test then compares 
the observed frequencies with the expected frequencies calculated based on the assumed distribution. 
We can see ∑(O – E) = 0, and this is not agood value to uase in a test. Based on that we see that The χ2 
Goodness of fit test is based on the following formula: χ2 = σ

variable, Oi is the observed frequency in category i, and Ei is the expected frequency based on the assumed 
probability distribution. Having said that so far, let us check on our fair die!

Solution:
As it was the case with a binomial random variable, we can ask the question: did you get one 
or not? So, each outcome can be looked at as binomial random variable, and thus the expected 
value is given by np, where n is the total number of trials and p is the probability to get that 
outcome. Therefore we have the following table

As it was the case with any statistical test, there are some conditions to be satisfied before carrying

As it was discussed in Chapter 4, we can carry the process of testing a statistical hypothesis by the classical 
method or the p-value method. We are not listing the steps here again, (check chapter 4). It is to be 
noticed here that, we will consider a one-tailed test, i.e. a right-tail test, and reject the null hypothesis 
for a large value of the test statistic. The goodness-of-fit test is used when we have ONE Multinomial 
Random Variable (one factor at different levels) which is characterized in k categories. In case we have 
two multinomial random variables the above goodness-of-fit does not apply. This is the the topic for 
the next section.
6.3	
Contingency Tables
In section 6.2 we learned that The Chi-Square Goodness-of-fit-Test, using the Chi-Square distribution 
could help to determine that if a model falls into some specified distribution. A problem frequently 
encountered in the analysis of count data concerns assessment of the independence of two methods 
for classification. For example we may classify a sample of people by gender and by their political 
affiliation in order to test the hypothesis that political affiliation and gender are independent. This kind 
of classifying our sample will generate a crosstabulation or a two-way table, and this will form what we 
call a contingency table. The categories of one variable label the rows, say r rows; and the categories of 
the other variable will label the columns, say c columns. Thus there are rXc cells in the table.Each cell 
will contain the number of observations that fit the categories of that row and that column.

Suppose that we are interested in classifying the type of defects found in a manufactured product according 
to (1) the type of defect and (2) the production shift. A total of n = 309 defects were recorded and the 
defects were classified as one of four types, A, B, C, or D. At the same time each item was identified 
according to the shift during which it was manufactured. Based on that classification we come up with 
the following contingency table of 3 rows and 4 columns,(it could be vice-versa), or 3×4 contingency 
table. Our objective is to test the Null hypothesis
H0: The type of defect is independent of the shift, against the alternative hypothesis
H1: The categorization schemes are dependent.
Let ݌஺ equal the unconditional probability that an item has a defect of type A. Similarly, define, ,and as 
the probabilities of observing the three other types of defects. These are called the column probabilities 
and their sum is one as you have expected. In a like manner let p1, p2, p3 be the row probabilities that a 
defective item was produced by the shift 1, 2 or 3, where p1+p2+ p3 = 1.
If the two classifications are independent of each other, then each cell probability will be equal to the 
product of the row probability and the column probability. Hence for cell C11 the probability for an 
item to be there is p1∙pA, and so on for the other cells. But it is to be noticed here that neither the row 
probabilities neither the column probabilities are give. We appeal to the relative frequency definition of 
probabilities to find all those probabilities for the specified cells. Thus 
Pi = (total of row i) / grand total of the observation  

Similarly, the probabilities for the types of defects, i.e, the columns, can be found by the same way. What 
about the probability of each cell. These are defined in the same way as relative probabilities. Hence we have

If we look at esch cell individually and ask ourselves, is that item here or not? Thus we have a Bernoulli 
experiment, and we recall how to find the mean of a binomial random variable. The mean = number of 
trials x the probability of success, i.e. the probability falling into that cell. In otherwords we have, based 
on the independence of the rows and the columns we find that, for i = 1, 2, 3; and j = A, B, C, D, as above

The critical value for the test is, with 0.05 level of significance, 12.5916, for 6 degrees of freedom. Since 
19.17 > 12.5916, the null hypothesis is rejected. Therefore the conclusion is that the type of defect is 
dependent on the shift. The interested student can work exercise 6.6 and consult Wackerly et al 2008

The one-Way Analysis of Variance
The one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) is used to determine whether there are any significant 
differences among the means of three or more independent (unrelated) populations. This guide will 
provide a brief introduction to the one-way ANOVA, including the assumptions of the test and when 
you should use this test. 
The one-way ANOVA compares the means among the groups you are interested in and determines 
whether any of those means are significantly different from each other. Specifically, it tests the null 
hypothesis: H0: μ1 = μ2 = μ3 =… = μK
where μi, i =1,2,…, k, is the mean of the ith population and k is the number of populations. If, however, 
the one-way ANOVA returns a significant result, we accept the alternative hypothesis: H1, which is that 
there are at least 2 populations’ means that are significantly different from each other.
At this point, it is important to realize that the one-way ANOVA is an omnibus test statistic and cannot 
tell you which specific groups were significantly different from each other only that at least two groups 
were. To determine which specific groups differed from each other, you need to use a post-hoc test. Post-
hoc tests are described in Montgomery 2001, and Bakir and Shayib 1990.

Other Tests and Analysis Of Variance
The ANOVA produces an F-statistic, the ratio of the variance calculated among the means to the variance 
within the samples. If the group means are drawn from populations with the same mean values, the 
variance between the group means should be lower than the variance of the samples, following the 
central limit theorem. A higher ratio therefore implies that the samples were drawn from populations 
with different mean values. 
Typically, however, the one-way ANOVA is used to test about differences among at least three groups, 
since the two-group case can be covered by a t-test (Gosset 1908). When there are only two means to 
compare, the t-test and the F-test are equivalent; and the relation between ANOVA and T is given by 
F = T2.
6.4.1	
Assumptions
The results of a one-way ANOVA can be considered reliable as long as the following assumptions are met:
•	 Response variable are normally distributed (or approximately normally distributed).
•	 Samples are independent.
•	 Variances of populations are equal.
•	 Responses for a given group are independent and identically distributed normal random 
variables (not a simple random sample (SRS)).
ANOVA is a relatively robust procedure with respect to violations of the normality assumption; Kirk,  
R.E. 1995. If data are ordinal, a non-parametric alternative to this test should be used such as Kruskal–
Wallis one-way analysis of variance, (interested reader may consult the references on the subject).
6.4.2	
The case of fixed effects, fully randomized experiment, unbalanced data
The model will be the normal linear model that describes treatment groups with probability distributions 
which are identically bell-shaped (normal) curves with different means. Thus fitting the models requires 
only the means of each treatment group and a variance calculation (an average variance within the 
treatment groups is used). Calculations of the means and the variance are performed as part of the 
hypothesis test. The commonly used normal linear models for a completely randomized experiment 
are; (see Montgomery, D.C. 2001)
Yij = µj + Eij (The means model)	
 i = 1, 2, …,nj and j = 1, 2, …, k 
Or
Yij = µ+ Ţj + Eij (The effects model) i = 1, 2, …,nj and j = 1, 2, …, k.

Where: i = 1, 2, …,nj is an index over experimental units,
j = 1, 2, …, k is an index over treatment groups
nj is the number of experimental units in the jth treatment group
N = ∑ nj is the total number of experimental units
Yij are the observations
μj is the mean of the observations for the jth treatment group
μ is the grand mean of the observations
Ţj = µj – µ is the jth treatment effect, a deviation from the grand mean
∑ Ţj = 0, and E ~ N(0, σ2), Eij are normally distributed zero-mean random errors.
The Eij are called “random errors”, “random residuals”, or “experimental errors”. They represent effects of 
all extraneous fluctuations that are beyond the control of the researcher. Large uncontrolled variations 
are common in most sciences. There are two main sources of experimental errors:
1.	 The first source is the inherited variability in the experimental material to which the 
treatments are applied. An experimental unit is a group of material to a single treatment is 
applied in a single trial. It could be a lot of land, a patient in a hospital, a chemical batch, 
etc. Such units usually produce different results even when subjected to the same treatment. 
These differences, whether large or small, contribute to the experimental errors.

The test statistic is &с
ெௌ೟ೝ೐ೌ೟
ெௌ೐ೝೝ೚ೝ͕, which has an f-distribution with (k-1, N-k) degrees of freedom, when 
H0 is true.
Critical region of size: Reject H0 if &൐݂ଵିఈ, where ݂ଵିఈ is the (1- α) percentile point of the F-distribution 
with the above degrees of freedom.
The rationale of the ANOVA test is as follows: If H0 is true, then each tj = 0, then E (MStreat) = σ2 = E 
(MSerror) in the ANOVA table. This will imply that F =1, otherwise F > 1 when H0 is false because in 
that case MStreat > MSerror. Hence we reject H0 if F is large.
While two columns of SS are shown for their explanatory value, only one column is required to display 
results.
MSError is the estimate of the variance corresponding to σ2 of the model.

Analysis summary
The core ANOVA analysis consists of a series of calculations. The data is collected in tabular form. Then
•	 Each treatment group is summarized by the number of experimental units, two sums, a 
mean and a variance. The treatment group summaries are combined to provide totals for the 
number of units and the sums. The grand mean and grand variance are computed from the 
grand sums. The treatment and grand means are used in the model.
•	 The three DFs and SSs are calculated from the summaries. Then the MSs are calculated and 
a ratio determines F.
•	 A computer typically determines a p-value from F which determines whether treatments 
produce significantly different results. If the result is significant, then the model 
provisionally has validity.
If the experiment is balanced, all of the nj terms are equal, so the SS equations simplify. In a more 
complex experiment, where the experimental units (or environmental effects) are not homogeneous, 
row statistics are also used in the analysis. The model includes terms dependent on i. Determining the 
extra terms reduces the number of degrees of freedom available.

Is there a significant difference in the average grades of the four sections? Use a 0.05 level of 
significance.
Solution:
We will be using the Model 
Yij = µ+ Ţj + Eij (The effects model) i = 1, 2, …,nj and j = 1, 2, …, 4; with n1= 6, n2= 4, n3 = 5, 
and n4 = 4.

Using the data provided, we have the following computations:
SStotal = 148, SStreat = 57, thus SSerror = 91, which will make the following table:

With the critical value of f.95 (3, 15) = 3.29, H0 is not rejected, since 3.13 < 3.29. The conclusion 
is that there is no difference in the means of the four sections on that final exam.

Other Tests and Analysis Of Variance
On another way, if the level of significance has changed to be 0.10,we find that f.90 (3,15) = 2.49, 
and since 3.13 > 2.49, in this case the null hypothesis will be rejected indicating that there is 
a difference between the means of the four sections on this final exam.
The interested reader, who likes to make the comparison after the ANOVA, or carrying the 
test of hypotheses involving a linear combination of the treatment effects, can consult Bakir 
and Shayib 1990, or other references of his choice.

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!
