WordPress Web Design For Dummies, 2nd Edition

Introduction
W
 
ordPress is the most popular content management system (CMS) on 
the web. Users of the WordPress platform can easily publish their 
content on the Internet because of its intuitive user interface. A large seg-
ment of the WordPress user community wants to delve a bit deeper into 
the platform so that they can not only publish content but also make their 
websites look fantastic by designing, customizing, and manipulating their 
WordPress themes. In fact, as a WordPress designer and consultant myself, 
two of the most frequent questions I hear from my clients are “How can I 
design my own theme for WordPress?” and “How can I design and build my 
entire website with WordPress?”
WordPress Web Design For Dummies, 2nd Edition, answers those questions 
and unlocks the mysteries of designing websites with the WordPress content 
management system. If you have ever tried to tweak an existing WordPress 
theme file, or even design your own WordPress theme from scratch, and have 
found it to be intimidating or too difficult to understand, this book breaks it 
down for you in a friendly and easy-to-understand manner.
About This Book
This book starts by walking you through the basics of understanding and  
setting up WordPress so that you can
	
✓	Understand the fundamental difference between a blog and a website.
	
✓	Define what a content management system (CMS) is.
	
✓	Explore different ways that websites use WordPress.
	
✓	Get to know WordPress basic requirements.
	
✓	Explore web- hosting recommendations.
	
✓	Install WordPress on your web server.
	
✓	Discover ways to publish and manage your content.
In this book, you also discover the right tools to use for publishing and 
designing with WordPress, including tools that help you
	
✓	Write and edit code.
	
✓	Transfer files from your computer to your web server.
	
✓	Create, edit, and design graphics.
	
✓	Choose colors schemes and fonts.
	
✓	Plan your design strategy.

2
WordPress Web Design For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
WordPress Web Design For Dummies, 2nd Edition, also addresses issues related 
to web design by walking you through some basic design skills, such as  
understanding and designing with Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and HyperText 
Markup Language (HTML). You also explore basic design concepts, such as 
color, typography, and layouts.
Finally, this book wouldn’t be complete without in-depth information on using 
the WordPress technology to create dynamic websites. I introduce templates 
and themes and explain how to use WordPress template tags to create great 
features. I show how to use WordPress to build all sorts of websites, such as 
small business sites, e-commerce sites, photo galleries and portfolios, real-
estate sites, social communities and discussion forums, and more.
Foolish Assumptions
I made a few small assumptions, and one very large one, about you while I 
wrote this book. I want to get the large one out of the way immediately: You 
already know how to use WordPress.
Yes, that’s right — this book doesn’t show you how to use the WordPress 
software to publish posts, create categories, or use the Dashboard, for exam-
ple. I assume you have that knowledge already and you’ve been working with 
WordPress for at least a few weeks. My other book, WordPress For Dummies, 
is a fantastic companion to this one because it takes you, starting with step 1, 
through all the steps you need to know to use WordPress. If you feel you may 
need a review or a solid introduction to the WordPress software, pick up a 
copy of that book too.
I also assume you use the self-hosted version of WordPress that you down-
loaded from the official WordPress website at http://wordpress.org. 
The other version of WordPress, the hosted service at http://wordpress.
com, is not compatible with the extensive theme customizations and plugin 
usage and installations discussed in this book. In fact, the hosted service that 
WordPress offers at http://wordpress.com is not covered in this book.
Other assumptions I make about you include these:
	
✓	You’re interested in finding out how to tweak and/or build a WordPress 
theme. This includes aspects of graphic design, CSS, and HTML.
	
✓	You have a domain name and a hosting account, or you will set them 
up very soon, as described in Chapter 2. (You can’t use the hosted 
WordPress.com service to accomplish everything I present in this book.)
	
✓	You’re a savvy Internet user, and you can use the Internet to search for 
information, download files, and browse websites and blogs.
	
✓	You have a basic understanding of what blogs are and how people use 
them to communicate their thoughts and content on the web.

 Introduction
Icons Used in This Book
Icons are those little pictures in the margins of this book that emphasize 
information that I think you may find helpful, that may be a danger to be 
aware of, that’s aimed for techies, or that’s a point to remember. Those 
points are illustrated as follows:
	
Tips are little bits of information that you may find useful — procedures that 
aren’t necessarily obvious to the casual user or beginner.
	
When your mother warned you, “Don’t touch that pan — it’s hot!” but you 
touched it anyway, you discovered the meaning of the word “Ouch!” I use this 
icon for situations like that.
	
You don’t need to possess a PhD in computer programming to understand 
how to build websites using WordPress; however, occasionally the informa-
tion presented in this book can inch a little more into the geeky side. That’s 
when I use this icon.
	
This icon is self-explanatory — I use it next to information I want you to 
remember and possibly come back to later.

Exploring Web Design  
with WordPress
In This Chapter
▶	Comparing blogs and websites
▶	Introducing WordPress as a content management system (CMS)
▶	Understanding ways to publish content with WordPress
▶	Discovering WordPress free and premium theme options
W
 
hen you discover that you can build and design more than just a blog 
with WordPress, you begin to realize the potential of the software 
and how you can apply it to your website-building efforts. For me, the light 
bulb went off in 2005 when my clients came to me wanting more than a blog 
on their sites. Many of them ran small businesses and needed to add other 
features to their websites, aside from the chronological display of the blog 
posts they’d been publishing.
This chapter introduces you to the concept of using WordPress as a content 
management system (CMS). You find out what CMS really means and see how 
you can apply it to your own website-designing efforts. You also discover 
what types of content you can publish with WordPress software and how you 
can leverage that content to build dynamic websites.
Additionally, this chapter introduces you to the world of WordPress themes —  
what’s currently available for you to use right away, what you can tweak to 
your own liking, and what you can research and dig through to discover more 
about WordPress design and theme building. You find out which themes are 
free for the taking and which themes cost you money to use. (Hint: The free 
ones are the best ones to practice with because there’s no cost to you!)
	
This book deals only with the self-hosted version of WordPress that you down-
load from the official WordPress website (http://wordpress.org). You can’t 
fully customize and use WordPress as a CMS, as described throughout this book,  
if you use the hosted service at WordPress.com (http://wordpress.com). 
The names (and domains) are so close that it’s easy to confuse them, so 

8
Part I: Establishing a WordPress Foundation 
the basic rule of thumb is this: If you did not install the software on a web-
hosting account for your own domain, you’re using the incorrect version of 
WordPress.
Delving Into the Differences between  
Blogs and Websites
If you read the introduction to this book, you know that I assume you already 
know how to use WordPress to publish content on the web. Therefore, 
you’re likely already aware of what a blog is and can recognize one when you 
encounter it on the Internet.
But just in case, a blog is typically a chronological listing of blog posts (or 
articles) that you (as a blogger) have published on the web. Often, having 
only a blog on a domain suits many people just fine — these people are 
referred to as bloggers, because they blog; that is pretty much all they do on 
their domain. 
Figure 1-1 shows you what a typical blog looks like with the display of blog 
posts in one column and navigation links and menu items in a smaller column 
to either the left or the right side.
Blogs have predictable features that you can assume exist, including
	
✓	A chronological listing of blog posts
	
✓	Blog posts archived by date, category, author, and tags (microcategories)
	
✓	A commenting feature that invites readers to leave comments on blog 
posts
	
✓	RSS (really simple syndication) feeds for posts and comments that get 
syndicated in RSS feed readers like Feedly (http://feedly.com) or 
Bloglines Reader (www.bloglines.com).
You can build a website with WordPress as well; however, it encompasses 
so much more than just having a blog on your domain. Many websites built 
with WordPress, such as business or corporate sites, don’t even have a blog. 
Other websites have blogs, but they’re not the main focus of the site. Several 
types of sites, such as business sites, have more content and features than 
just blog posts to offer visitors, and WordPress allows you to have both a 
blog and a full-blown website.

 Chapter 1: Exploring Web Design with WordPress
Figure 1-1: My personal blog at http://lisasabin-wilson.com/.
	
When designing a website, you need to sit down and map out which of the 
many WordPress features you’re going to use, as well as decide how and 
where you’re going to use them on the site. Chapter 8 takes you through 
planning your design strategy — don’t miss it!
My business website, WebDevStudios (http://webdevstudios.com), is a 
good example of using WordPress as a content management system (CMS) to 
design and create a small business website. For instance, in Figure 1-2, you 
see that the front page of my business website doesn’t look anything like a 
traditional blog; however, if you look near the top, you see a link to the blog.
You can manage and maintain several sections of your website through 
the use of one installation of the WordPress software on your web-hosting 
account, and create the visual look and design/layout of the site through 
manipulation of the WordPress theme templates. (I introduce themes later  
in this chapter.)

 Chapter 1: Exploring Web Design with WordPress
	
The chapters in Part III of this book give you the information you need to 
work with and create WordPress theme templates, and Part IV provides solid 
information about design concepts like CSS and HTML that help you put your 
entire WordPress theme together for your own unique website design.
My business site, shown in Figure 1-2, is just one example of a type of website 
that can be built with the WordPress software, with or without a blog. Figures 
1-1 and 1-2 illustrate some basic differences between a blog and a website. 
This book concentrates on website design overall, not just blog design 
(although all concepts presented in the chapters in this book can be applied 
to both).
Using WordPress as a Content  
Management System
A term that you’ll hear regularly in the WordPress community is the term 
CMS, which stands for content management system. Whether you run a blog, a 
website, or both, you use WordPress to manage your content by publishing 
and editing it regularly.
When WordPress was first released in 2003, it became well known, worldwide, 
as the most popular blogging platform available on the web. That is still the 
case; however, as WordPress development has evolved over the years, it 
has grown from a blogging platform into a full-featured content management 
system that allows you to publish all sorts of content types to the web with 
very little technical ability or skill. Because you install WordPress on your web 
server, and you access the back-end controls — the Dashboard — via a web 
address, it’s considered a web-based content management system.
You may be asking yourself how a blogging platform, which allows you to 
publish content on the web, differs from a web-based content management 
system. The two seem to be interchangeable, and some say it’s just a matter 
of semantics. You’ll find that in the WordPress community, content manage-
ment system refers to the ability to easily publish different types of content 
using one installation of WordPress. More than just a blog, you can build and 
design a website that includes different content types, including (but not  
limited to)
	
✓	E-commerce: Host a store, or marketplace, to sell your products and 
services directly on your website. Figure 1-3 shows a website called 
IconDock (http://icondock.com), which is a great example of 
WordPress being used as an e-commerce online store.

12
Part I: Establishing a WordPress Foundation 
Figure 1-3: IconDock is a website that uses WordPress to power its online storefront.
	
✓	Photo gallery or portfolio: Create and publish photo galleries or an 
online portfolio of design work, creative pieces, or photography, for 
example.
	
✓	Discussion forum: Host a forum on your website where visitors can 
create new and respond to existing threads of conversation with other 
site visitors, based around topics of shared interest.
	
✓	Social community: Create an integrated social community on your 
WordPress site that allows visitors to create profiles, groups, and 
forums, enabling them to interact with other visitors on your domain.
	
✓	Small business: Create an entire website for your business that includes 
static pages for content that doesn’t change all that often (FAQ pages, 
terms of service, and sales pages, for example). You can decide to have a 
blog on your business site, or no blog at all — WordPress lets you do both.
	
✓	Forms: Create and include forms on your website to allow your visitors 
to get in touch with you directly from the pages on your domain. You can 
use forms as e-mail communication tools or sales tools, or to conduct 
surveys to gather feedback from your readers and/or clients.
	
✓	Social media integration: Gather the content that you publish on other 
networks like Facebook or Twitter and integrate it into your website 
using different techniques and plugins available for WordPress.

13
 Chapter 1: Exploring Web Design with WordPress
The preceding list is just a sampling of the different types of content that you 
can publish and manage using WordPress as a CMS rather than as a blogging 
platform only. Be sure to check out Chapter 18 for some other real-life exam-
ples of websites that use WordPress as a CMS.
To include these different content types on your website, in some cases — 
such as with e-commerce and social communities — you need to install spe-
cial plugins, or scripts, that extend the feature set of the WordPress software. 
And in certain cases like discussion forums and photo galleries, you need to 
account for these different content types in your WordPress theme design as 
well, through the use of template tags, CSS, and HTML. Part III of this book 
(Chapters 9 through 13) takes you through what you need to know for creat-
ing WordPress themes and templates, and Chapters 15 and 16 give you some 
great ideas for techniques and plugins you can use to create different fea-
tures and content types on your WordPress-powered website.
Discovering the World of WordPress Themes
WordPress themes are simply a group of files, called templates, which determine 
the look and basic function of your site. Literally thousands upon thousands 
of free WordPress themes are available for you to choose from. WordPress 
has an official Themes Directory on its website at http://wordpress.org/
extend/themes (shown in Figure 1-4).
Additionally, you can browse, download, and install free WordPress themes from 
the comfort of your own WordPress Dashboard. All the themes that you find in 
the official Free Themes Directory are also accessible within your Dashboard 
by choosing Appearance➪Themes and then clicking the Install Themes tab, as 
shown in Figure 1-5. (See Chapter 9 for the lowdown on installing themes.)
Open source and the GPL
WordPress is an open-source software project 
(OSS); therefore, the base code that powers 
the WordPress software is open and avail-
able to the public for you to view, read, learn 
from, and maybe even apply to your own proj-
ects. Additionally, WordPress is licensed by 
the GPLv2 license from the Free Software 
Foundation (http://www.fsf.org/). A 
copy of the license is included in every instal-
lation of the WordPress software, if you care to 
read it. Basically, the GPL license gives anyone 
the ability to view, copy, and re-release or redis-
tribute the code without any legal consequence. 
This concept applies to themes and plugins, as 
well. That makes them an accessible tool to 
learn from, and because the software is free, 
it makes your education free (and priceless). 
Understand that any theme you create using 
WordPress must also be released under the 
GPL license; because they use the WordPress 
core code as a foundation, your theme projects 
automatically inherit the GPL license.

Part I: Establishing a WordPress Foundation 
Figure 1-4: The official WordPress Themes Directory.
Figure 1-5: Browse thousands of free WordPress themes from your Dashboard.

15
 Chapter 1: Exploring Web Design with WordPress
	
WordPress themes that appear in the official directory are fully checked out, 
vetted, and approved for listing by WordPress. With this theme review, you 
can feel comfortable knowing that the theme you’re using meets the guide-
lines that WordPress has put in place for quality control.
It’s possible that you’ll find exactly what you’re looking for in a theme using 
one from the Free Themes Directory; however, you and I haven’t even met, 
but I know something about you based on the fact that you’re reading this 
book. You want to learn how to tweak, customize, and create your own 
WordPress theme by learning and applying the skills necessary to do that. 
Free WordPress themes are a great place to start, especially themes from the 
official WordPress Free Theme Directory. The free themes from the direc-
tory contain all the standard features that users expect from themes, so they 
make an excellent starting point in your learning process. That’s right, I said 
it! Open up one of those themes from the free directory and start reading, 
learning, and applying the code you find there to themes that you create for 
yourself, your friends, or your clients.
Typically, it would be a big no-no to tell you to copy work from another 
person; however, that is exactly the spirit of the WordPress community, 
and the spirit of open source and the GPL (General Public License) that 
WordPress (and its themes and plugins) is released under (see the “Open 
source and the GPL” sidebar). In fact, Chapters 10 and 11 take you through 
the steps of doing just that; Chapter 10 walks you through the (free) default 
WordPress theme called Twenty Thirteen, and Chapter 11 dissects the tem-
plate files. Chapters 12 and 14 take you through template tags, and how to 
customize their look and design with CSS and HTML coding.
Checking Out Premium WordPress  
Themes and Frameworks
Not all WordPress themes are created equal; that is to say, not every 
WordPress theme you encounter is free. GPL-licensed software, like 
WordPress and related plugins and themes, is not always free, as in price. 
Several years ago, a premium theme market emerged within the WordPress 
community by developers and designers who offer high-quality themes and 
provide ongoing support for the use of those themes for a price that ranges 
anywhere from $50–$300 each, depending on which theme you use.
Many of the premium-theme providers offer special themes that they’ve termed 
frameworks. Frameworks are essentially WordPress themes with all the built-in 
features and functionality and are optimized and coded to act as a parent 
theme, making WordPress theme development quicker and allowing you to 
use it to create an unlimited number of child themes. I cover parent and child 

16
Part I: Establishing a WordPress Foundation 
themes in depth in Chapter 13; you can head there now to read more about 
those topics, or file the terms “parent/child themes” in the back of your 
mind, knowing that you revisit those concepts later in this book.
Premium themes and frameworks offer you an easy way to help yourself, 
your friends, and your clients design a nice-looking website quickly using 
WordPress for a lower cost than it would take to hire someone to design and 
build a custom theme for you. Premium themes have their limitations, as 
well, however; because someone else built the theme, you are limited to the 
features and functions that the developer/designer of the theme included. 
If you want to add additional features, it may mean digging into the code of 
the template files and making some adjustments. (Later in the book, you find 
information on how to tweak existing themes.)
	
Sometimes it’s better to code your own theme from scratch, simply because 
it’s easier for you to know your own code than it is to get to know someone 
else’s way of doing things. After you become comfortable designing your own 
theme, the choice is yours to make.
You can find a very nice selection of premium themes on the WordPress 
website, listed at http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/commercial. 
Here are some popular theme frameworks on the market today:
	
✓	iThemes Builder: http://ithemes.com/purchase/builder-theme
	
✓	StartBox: www.wpstartbox.com
	
✓	Hybrid: http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/hybrid
Getting Your Site Up and Running
Before you can even think about building themes and designing with 
WordPress, you have to lay the foundation. Doing so doesn’t take very long, 
but it involves setting up the right environment and gathering some essential 
tools to get the job done right. Setting up WordPress correctly the first time 
is important because having to set it up all over again after you’ve already 
begun using it is quite a hassle. In the first part of this book, you’ll find the 
steps to get WordPress up and running, including:
	
✓	Registering a domain (see Chapter 2)
	
✓	Obtaining a web host (see Chapter 2)
	
✓	Installing WordPress on your web server (see Chapter 3)
Then after you’re up and running, be sure to check out Chapter 4 for the low-
down on managing content and Chapter 5 for more about FTP and different 
web browsers.

Understanding WordPress 
Requirements
In This Chapter
▶	Registering a domain name
▶	Exploring web-hosting environments
▶	Understanding bandwidth and hard drive–space needs
T
 
his chapter introduces you to the basic requirements that need to be in 
place before you can install WordPress on a web server (as described in 
Chapter 3). I take you through the mechanics of registering a domain name, 
exploring web-hosting environments, and determining a plan for different 
WordPress projects in terms of bandwidth needs and hard drive–space options.
If you design WordPress websites for several clients, each client has unique 
needs for web hosting, depending on the type, scope, and breadth of the 
website it runs. This chapter helps you take all those factors into consider-
ation to determine the type of hosting environment needed for the job.
Establishing Your Domain
You’ve read the hype. You’ve heard the rumors. You’ve seen the flashy  
websites powered by WordPress. But where do you start?
The first steps toward installing and setting up a WordPress website are making 
a decision about a domain name and then purchasing the registration of that 
name through a domain registrar, a company that sells and administers domain 
names. A domain name is the unique web address that you type in a web 
browser’s address bar to visit a website — for example, wordpress.org and 
google.com.

18
Part I: Establishing a WordPress Foundation 
	
I emphasize unique because no two domain names can be the same. If some-
one else has registered the domain name you want, you can’t have it. With 
that in mind, you may need to take a bit of time to find a domain that isn’t 
already in use.
Understanding domain name extensions
When registering a domain name, consider the extension that you want. The 
.com, .net, .org, .info, .tv (for video), .fm (for audio), .co, or .biz 
extension that you see tagged on to the end of any domain name is the top-
level domain (TLD) extension. A top-level domain is the main domain name  
of a website, whereas a second level is a subdomain, or subdirectory, within 
the main domain. For example the main, top-level domain for Wiley is wiley.
com; whereas Wiley’s Online Library is located on a second-level domain: 
onlinelibrary.wiley.com. When you register your domain name, you also 
choose the extension you want for your domain (as long as it’s available, that is).
A word to the wise here: Just because you register your domain as a .com 
doesn’t mean that someone else doesn’t, or can’t, own the very same domain 
name with a .net. So if you register MyDogHasFleas.com and it becomes a 
hugely popular site among readers with dogs that have fleas, someone else 
can come along and register MyDogHasFleas.net — and run a similar site in 
the hope of riding the coattails of your website’s popularity and readership.
	
You can register your domain name with all available extensions if you want 
to avert this problem. My personal website, for example, has the domain 
name http://lisasabin-wilson.com; however, I also own http://
lisasabin-wilson.net.
Domain names: Do you own or rent?
In reality, when you “buy” a domain name, you 
don’t really own it. Rather, you purchase the 
right to use that domain name for the period of 
time specified in your order. You can register a 
domain name for one to ten years. Be aware, 
however, that if you don’t renew the domain 
name when your registration period ends, 
you lose it — and most often, you lose it right 
away to someone who preys on abandoned or 
expired domain names. Some people keep a 
close watch on expiring domain names, and as 
soon as the buying window opens, they snap up 
the names and use them for their own websites, 
hoping to take advantage of the popularity that 
the previous owners worked so hard to attain 
for those domains.

19
 Chapter 2: Understanding WordPress Requirements
Considering the cost of a domain name
Registering a domain costs you anywhere from $10 to $30 per year, depend-
ing on what service you use for a registrar and what options (such as privacy 
options and search-engine submission services) you apply to your domain 
name during the registration process.
	
After you pay the initial domain registration fee, you need to pay another fee 
when the renewal date comes up again in a year, or two, or five — however 
many years you choose to register your domain name for. (The length of time 
you register your domain is up to you, but if it’s a domain you’re planning 
to use for a long time, most registrars will give you a slight discount on the 
price if you register it for more than one year.) Most registrars let you sign up 
for an auto-renew service to automatically renew your domain name and bill 
the charges to the credit card you have set up on that account. The registrar 
sends you a reminder a few months in advance telling you it’s time to renew. 
If you don’t have auto renew set up, you need to log in to your registrar 
account before it expires and manually renew your domain name.
Registering your domain name
Domain registrars are certified and approved by the Internet Corporation 
for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). Although hundreds of domain 
registrars exist, the ones in the following list are popular because of their lon-
gevity in the industry, competitive pricing, and variety of services they offer 
in addition to domain name registration (such as web hosting and website 
traffic builders):
	
✓	GoDaddy.com: http://godaddy.com
	
✓	Register.com: http://register.com
	
✓	Network Solutions: http://networksolutions.com
	
✓	NamesDirect.com/Dotster: http://namesdirect.com
	
At this time, GoDaddy.com, shown in Figure 2-1, is probably the easiest and 
most cost-efficient way to register a domain name. At the time of this writing, 
GoDaddy.com currently has domain name registration starting at $9.99 per 
year.

20
Part I: Establishing a WordPress Foundation 
Enter domain name to check availability.
Figure 2-1: GoDaddy.com provides an easy, low-cost way to register a domain name.
No matter where you choose to register your domain name, here are the  
general steps to do so:
	
1.	Decide on a domain name.
	
	 Doing a little planning here is necessary. Many people think of a domain 
name as a brand — a way to identify their websites or blogs. Think of 
potential names for your site; then you can proceed with your plan.
	
2.	Verify the domain name’s availability.
	
	 In your web browser, enter the URL of the domain registrar of your 
choice. Look for the section on the registrar’s website that lets you enter 
the domain name (typically, a short text field; refer to Figure 2-1) to see 
www.allitebooks.com

21
 Chapter 2: Understanding WordPress Requirements
whether it’s available. If the domain name isn’t available as a .com, try 
.net or .info.
	
3.	Purchase the domain name.
	
	 Follow the domain registrar’s steps to purchase the name using your 
credit card. After you complete the checkout process, you receive an 
e-mail confirming your purchase, so be sure to use a valid e-mail address 
during the registration process.
After completing these steps, you need to obtain a hosting account, which I 
cover in the next section.
	
Some of the domain registrars have hosting services that you can sign up 
for, but you don’t have to use those services. Often, you can find hosting ser-
vices for a lower cost than most domain registrars offer; it just takes a little 
research. Check out some of the web-hosting providers I list in the “Finding a 
host that provides WordPress features” section, later in this chapter.
Finding a Home for Your Website
After you register your domain, you need to find a place for it to live — a web 
host — before you begin working with WordPress.
In the following sections, I cover the different features that web-hosting 
providers usually offer with a basic hosting account, as well as some rec-
ommendations on hosts that include support for the WordPress platform. 
Additionally, I provide you with some suggestions on how you can determine 
how much hard drive space and bandwidth you may need for your website.
Examining what services web hosts offer
A web host is a business, group, or individual that provides website owners 
with web-server space and bandwidth for file transfers. Usually, web-hosting 
services charge a monthly or annual fee — unless you’re fortunate enough to 
know someone who’s willing to give you server space and bandwidth for free. 
The cost varies from host to host, but you can obtain quality web-hosting 
services from $3 to $10 per month to start. (See the next section of this chap-
ter for a list of some recommended hosts that specialize in WordPress.)
Think of your web host as a garage that you pay to park your car in. The 
garage gives you the place to store your car (hard-drive space). The host 
even gives you a driveway so that you, and others, can get to and from your 
car (bandwidth). The garage owner won’t, however, fix your rockin’ stereo 

22
Part I: Establishing a WordPress Foundation 
system (WordPress or any other third-party software application) that you’ve 
installed — unless you’re willing to pay a few extra bucks for that service.
Hosting services generally provide (at least) these services with your account:
	
✓	Hard drive space: This is nothing more complicated than the hard drive 
on your own computer. Each hard drive has the capacity, or space, for a 
certain amount of files. An 80GB (gigabyte) hard drive can hold 80GB of 
data — and no more. Your hosting account provides you with a limited 
amount of hard drive space, and the same concept applies. If your web 
host provides you with 10GB of hard drive space, that’s the limit on the 
file size that you’re allowed to have. If you want more hard drive space, 
you need to upgrade your space limitations. Most web hosts have a 
mechanism in place for you to upgrade your allotment.
	
	For a new self-hosted WordPress website, you don’t need much hard 
drive space at all. A good starting point is 3–5GB of storage space. If you 
find that you need additional space in the future, you can contact your 
hosting provider for a space upgrade.
	
	Websites that run large files — such as video, audio, or photo files — 
generally benefit from more hard drive space compared with sites that 
don’t involve large files. Keep this point in mind when you sign up for 
your hosting account. Planning now will save you a few headaches down 
the road.
	
✓	Bandwidth (transfer): Bandwidth is the amount of data that’s carried 
from point A to point B within a specific period (usually only a second or 
two). To break it down: I live in the country — pretty much in the middle 
of nowhere. The water that comes to my house is provided by a private 
well that lies buried in the backyard somewhere. Between my house and 
the well are pipes that bring the water to my house. The pipes provide 
a free flow of water to my home so that everyone can enjoy their long, 
hot showers while I labor over dishes and laundry, all at the same time. 
Lucky me!
	
	The very same concept applies to the bandwidth available with your 
hosting account. Every web-hosting provider offers a variety of band-
width limits on the accounts it offers. When you want to view my web-
site in your browser window, the bandwidth is essentially the pipe that 
lets the data flow from my well to your computer and appear on your 
monitor. The bandwidth limit is kind of like the pipe connected to my 
well: It can hold only a certain amount of water before it reaches maxi-
mum capacity and won’t bring the water from the well any longer.
	
	Your bandwidth pipe size is determined by how much bandwidth your 
web host allows for your account — the larger the number, the bigger the 
pipe. A 50MB bandwidth limit makes for a smaller pipe than a 100MB limit.

23
 Chapter 2: Understanding WordPress Requirements
	
	Web hosts are pretty generous with the amount of bandwidth they pro-
vide in their packages. Like hard drive space, bandwidth is measured in 
gigabytes. A bandwidth provision of 10–50GB is generally a respectable 
amount to run a website with a blog.
	
✓	Domain e-mail with web mail access: The host allows you to have an 
e-mail address that has your own, unique domain name.
	
✓	File Transfer Protocol (FTP) access: FTP gives you the ability to transfer 
files from your computer to your web-hosting account, and vice versa. 
(See Chapter 5 for the lowdown on FTP.)
	
✓	Comprehensive website statistics: View detailed information on the traf-
fic that your website receives on a daily, weekly, monthly, and annual 
basis.
	
✓	MySQL database(s): This is the database system that WordPress uses to 
store your data. (See Chapter 3 for information on installing WordPress 
and using a MySQL database.)
	
✓	PHP: PHP is the programming language that WordPress is built on.
	
Because you intend to run WordPress on your web server, you need to look 
for a host that provides the current recommended, minimum requirements 
needed to run the WordPress software on your hosting account, which are
	
✓	PHP version 5.2.4 (or greater)
	
✓	MySQL version 5.0 (or greater)
The easiest way to find out whether a host meets the minimum requirements 
is to check the FAQ section of the host’s website, if it has one. If not, find the 
contact information for the hosting company and fire off an e-mail requesting 
information on what exactly it supports.
Finding a host that provides WordPress features
Web hosts consider WordPress a third-party application; therefore, the host 
typically won’t provide technical support for WordPress (or any other soft-
ware application) because it isn’t included in your hosting package. However, 
several web-hosting providers have WordPress-related services available for 
additional fees.
The popularity of WordPress has given birth to services on the web that 
emphasize its use. These services include WordPress designers, WordPress 
consultants, and — yes — web hosts that specialize in using WordPress. 
Many of these hosts offer a full array of WordPress features, such as an 
automatic WordPress installation included with your account, a library of 

24
Part I: Establishing a WordPress Foundation 
WordPress themes, and a staff of support technicians who are experienced in 
using WordPress.
Here’s a list of some of those providers, each with their own packages, pricing 
models, and features:
	
✓	Page.ly: http://page.ly
	
✓	WPEngine: http://wpengine.com
	
✓	ZippyKid: http://zippykid.com
	
To find out whether your chosen host supports WordPress, always ask. As 
a WordPress user, you can find WordPress support in the official forums at 
http://wordpress.org/support.
	
A few web-hosting providers offer free domain name registration when you 
sign up for hosting services. Research the way a hosting provider handles 
domain registration and read its terms of service because that free domain 
name may come with conditions. Many of my clients have gone this route 
only to find out a few months later that the web-hosting provider has full con-
trol of the domain name and they aren’t allowed to move that domain off the 
host’s servers, either for a set period (usually a year or two) or for infinity. 
It’s always best to have the control in your hands, not someone else’s, so try 
and stick with an independent domain registrar, such as Network Solutions.
Planning for future needs
When it comes to bandwidth and hard drive space for website hosting, take 
into consideration what type of website you’re building. Whether for yourself 
or a client, do everyone a favor and plan ahead to avoid potential problems 
down the road.
Different types of websites use more bandwidth, hard drive space, and server 
resources than others. You need to consider the type of traffic the website 
gets now as well as how much you expect it to get over the course of the next 
several months. When you think about building additional features on your 
site, consider the amount of hard drive space (storage) you’ll need to store 
the files and data, and the amount of traffic (bandwidth) required to manage 
it. For example, a photo gallery or portfolio will require storage for large 
image files and a good amount of bandwidth to handle the transfer of the 
large image files from your web server to your visitor’s browser; therefore, 
consider that when calculating hard drive storage space and bandwidth.
If you want to build a social community (see Chapter 16 for information on 
building/designing a social community with the BuddyPress plugin), there 

25
 Chapter 2: Understanding WordPress Requirements
are several other factors to consider because the traffic of your community 
members will be much more regular. And if you set up the community to 
allow members to share photos and videos and participate in discussion 
forums, the hard drive space needed to do that will increase by quite a lot.
Know your site and develop a plan to make sure you have the hosting 
requirements accounted for and in place — this will save you many head-
aches down the road.
Being cautious about offers of unlimited  
space and bandwidth
A lot of hosting providers are out there, and it’s an extremely competitive 
market — trust me. I want to caution you about those hosting providers that 
offer unlimited packages, though. Basically, for a certain cost per month, you 
get unlimited bandwidth transfer and unlimited hard drive space (along with 
unlimited domains, databases . . . pretty much unlimited everything!). This 
isn’t to say that the hosts that do this aren’t good ones. But, a popular school 
of thought says that there’s no such thing as unlimited. What you need to 
do when you encounter these offers is to read the hosting provider’s terms 
of service. Pay particular attention to what they have to say about server 
resources, or more specifically, CPU (central processing unit that executes 
the web server) resource usage.
Although these hosting providers may offer unlimited transfer and hard drive 
space, if your website gets a traffic spike, the CPU resource usage goes up, 
and many hosts will throttle your site if your account uses a certain amount 
of the overall server CPU resource. By throttle, I mean they’ll turn off your 
website temporarily until the CPU resource use goes down — which gener-
ally means that you lose all that traffic that probably caused the rise in CPU 
resource usage to begin with.
If you see an unlimited offer that looks good to you, pursue it. Just be sure to 
investigate a bit and ask the right questions, such as “What are the CPU limi-
tations for my account, and what happens if I exceed them?”
Forewarned is forearmed.

hen delving in to the world of WordPress web design, you need to 
make sure that you set up a solid foundation to work from. This 
means that you need to have the latest version of WordPress installed on 
your web server and know how to upgrade it when WordPress releases a new 
version of its software, which it does approximately once every 120 days.
This chapter takes you through installing WordPress correctly, step by step, 
so you have a solid foundation to work from. That foundation allows you to 
concentrate more on your design work and coding and less on the back-end, 
server-related issues that may pop up if you don’t pay attention to those ini-
tial installation steps.
If you plan on designing and developing WordPress themes for yourself, for 
public release, or for paid clients, you need to understand the release sched-
ule of WordPress development, versions, and nightly builds, or bleeding edge 
versions, which are released prior to official releases. This chapter gives you 
the resources you need to stay up to date with WordPress development.
Installing WordPress
Before you’re ready to install WordPress, you need to do the following:
	
✓	Purchase the domain name registration for your account.
	
✓	Obtain a hosting service on a web server for your site.

28
Part I: Establishing a WordPress Foundation 
	
✓	Establish your hosting account username, password, and File Transfer 
Protocol (FTP) address.
	
✓	Acquire an FTP client for transferring files to your hosting account.
If you’ve missed any of the first three items listed, see Chapter 2 for details. 
For more on acquiring and using an FTP client, see Chapter 5.
	
Some web hosts offer a one-click installation process for WordPress through 
scripts like Fantastico, which is the most popular script installer available. 
If this is the case for you, you can simply follow the instructions provided 
by your web host (and skip ahead to the “Discovering WordPress Release 
Cycles” section, later in this chapter). The instructions in this section are for 
manually installing WordPress on your web server.
If you have to install WordPress manually, here’s where the rubber meets the 
road — that is, you’re putting WordPress’s famous five-minute installation to 
the test. Set your watch and see whether you can meet that five-minute mark.
	
The famous five-minute installation includes the time it takes to install only 
the software. It doesn’t include the time to register a domain name; obtain 
and set up your web-hosting service; and download, install, configure, and 
figure out how to use the FTP software.
Without further ado, here are the general steps to install WordPress:
	
1.	Get the latest version of the WordPress software at http:// 
wordpress.org/download.
	
	 WordPress gives you two compression formats for the software: .zip 
and tar.gz. I recommend getting the Zip file because it’s the most 
common format for compressed files.
	
2.	Download the WordPress software to your computer and decompress 
(or unpack or unzip) it to a folder on your computer’s hard drive.
	
	 You can use a free web application such as WinZip (www.winzip.com) 
to decompress the file.
	
3.	Set up a MySQL database so that it’s ready to accept the installation.
	
4.	Upload (transfer) the WordPress files from your hard drive to your 
web-server account (the one you obtain in Chapter 2).
	
5.	Connect the WordPress software you uploaded to the MySQL database.
I discuss Steps 3 through 5 in more detail in the following sections.

29
 Chapter 3: Installing WordPress on Your Web Server
Setting up the MySQL database
WordPress software is a personal publishing system that uses a PHP/MySQL 
platform, which provides everything you need to create your own website 
and publish your own content dynamically without knowing how to code 
those pages. In short, all your content (such as options, posts, comments, 
and so on) is stored in a MySQL database in your hosting account.
	
Every time visitors go to your website to read your content, they make a 
request that’s sent to your server. The PHP programming language receives 
that request, obtains the requested information from the MySQL database, 
and then presents the requested information to your visitors through their 
web browsers.
Every web host is different in how it gives you access to set up and manage 
your MySQL database(s) for your account. In this section, I use cPanel, a pop-
ular hosting interface. If your host provides a different interface, the same 
basic steps apply; just the interface setup that your web host provides may 
be different.
To set up the MySQL database for your WordPress site with cPanel, follow 
these steps:
	
1.	 Log in to your hosting account administration interface with the user-
name and password assigned to you by your web host.
	
	 I use the cPanel administration interface, but your host may provide 
NetAdmin or Plesk, for example.
	
2.	 Locate the MySQL Database Administration icon in your cPanel.
	
	 In cPanel, click the MySQL Databases icon.
	
	 The MySQL Databases page appears, as shown in Figure 3-1.
	
3.	Enter a name for your database in the New Database text box.
	
	 Be sure to make note of the database name because you need it when 
installing WordPress.
	
	 Usually, I give my database a name that I’ll easily recognize later. This 
practice is especially helpful if you run more than one MySQL database 
in your account. If I name this database something like WordPress or 
wpblog, I can be reasonably certain — a year from now when I want to 
access my database to make some configuration changes — that I know 
exactly which one I need to deal with.
	
4.	Click the Create Database button.
	
	 A message appears, confirming that the database has been created.

30
Part I: Establishing a WordPress Foundation 
Figure 3-1: The MySQL Databases page in cPanel.
	
5.	Click the Go Back link or the Back button on your browser toolbar.
	
	 This returns you to the MySQL Databases page where your newly cre-
ated database is listed under Current Databases.
	
6.	Scroll down the page to the Add New User area, enter a username and 
password for your database, and then click the Create User button.
	
	 A confirmation message appears, stating that the username was created 
with the password you specified.
	
	 For security reasons, make sure that your password isn’t something that 
sneaky hackers can guess easily. During the database-creation process, 
cPanel gives you a handy tool to create a password using a very secure 
combination of numbers, letters, and symbols that makes it virtually 
uncrackable.

31
 Chapter 3: Installing WordPress on Your Web Server
	
	 Make absolutely sure that you note the database name (from step 3), 
username, and password that you set up during this process. You need 
them in the next section before officially installing WordPress on your 
web server. Jot them down on a piece of paper or copy and paste them 
into a text editor; either way, just make sure you have them handy.
	
7.	Click the Go Back link or the Back button on your browser toolbar.
	
	 This returns you to the MySQL Databases page.
	
8.	In the Add Users to Database section, choose the user you just set up 
from the User drop-down list and then choose the database from the 
Database drop-down list.
	
	 The MySQL Account Maintenance, Manage User Privileges page appears.
	
9.	Select the All Privileges check box to assign user privileges.
	
	 Because you’re the administrator (owner) of this database, make sure 
you assign all privileges to the new user you just created.
	
10.	Click the Make Changes button.
	
	 A page opens with a confirmation message that you’ve added the 
selected user to the selected database.
	
11.	Click the Go Back link to return to the MySQL Databases page to see 
your new MySQL database and user listed on the MySQL Databases 
page.
Uploading the WordPress files
To upload the WordPress files to your host, return to the folder on your 
computer where you unpacked the WordPress software that you downloaded 
earlier. Figure 3-2 displays the WordPress files on my local computer on the 
left side of the figure, with the same files displayed on my web server on the 
right side.
Using your FTP client, connect to your web server and upload all these files 
into the root directory of your hosting account. (I discuss this process in 
more detail in Chapter 5.)
	
If you don’t know what your root directory is, contact your hosting provider 
and ask. Every hosting provider’s setup is different. On my web server, my 
root directory is the public_html folder; some of my clients have a root 
directory in the httpdocs folder. The answer really depends on what type of 
setup your hosting provider has. When in doubt, ask!

32
Part I: Establishing a WordPress Foundation 
Figure 3-2: Using an FTP client makes file transfers easy.
Here are a few things to keep in mind when you upload your files:
	
✓	Upload the contents of the /wordpress folder to your web server — 
not the folder itself. Most FTP client software lets you select all the files 
and drag and drop them to your web server. Other programs have you 
highlight the files and click a Transfer button.
	
✓	Choose the correct transfer mode. File transfers via FTP have two 
forms: ASCII and binary. Most FTP clients are configured to autodetect 
the transfer mode. Understanding the difference as it pertains to this 
WordPress installation is important so that you can troubleshoot any 
problems you may have later:
	
•	Binary transfer mode is how images (such as JPG, GIF, BMP, and 
PNG files) are transferred via FTP.
	
•	ASCII transfer mode is for everything else (text files, PHP files, 
JavaScript, and so on).
	
	For the most part, having the transfer mode of your FTP client set to auto-
detect is a safe bet. But if you experience issues with how those files load 
on your site, retransfer the files using the appropriate transfer mode.

33
 Chapter 3: Installing WordPress on Your Web Server
	
✓	You can choose a different folder from the root. You aren’t required 
to transfer the files to the root directory of your web server. You can 
choose to run WordPress on a subdomain or in a different folder on 
your account. If you want your blog address to be http://your 
domain.com/blog, for example, you’d transfer the WordPress files  
into a /blog folder.
	
✓	Choose the correct file permissions. File permissions tell the web server 
how these files can be handled on your server — whether they’re files 
that can be written to. As a general rule, PHP files need to have a per-
mission (chmod) of 666, whereas file folders need a permission of 755. 
Almost all FTP clients let you check and change the permissions on the 
files, if you need to. Typically, you can find the option to change file 
permissions within the menu options of your FTP client. (I discuss file 
permissions in more detail in Chapter 5.)
	
	Some hosting providers run their PHP software in a more secure format — 
safe mode. If this is the case with your host, you need to set the PHP files 
to 644. If you’re unsure, ask your hosting provider what permissions you 
need to set for PHP files.
Running the install script
The final step in the installation procedure for WordPress is connecting the 
WordPress software you uploaded to the MySQL database. Follow these steps:
	
1.	Type the following URL in the address box of your browser, replacing 
yourdomain.com with your own domain name:
http://yourdomain.com/wp-admin/install.php
	
	 If you installed WordPress in a different folder from the root directory 
of your account, make sure you indicate this in the URL for the install 
script. If you transferred the WordPress software files to a /blog folder, 
for example, you’d point your browser to the following URL to run the 
installation: http://yourdomain.com/blog/wp-admin/install.php.
	
	 Assuming that you did everything correctly (see Table 3-1 later in this 
chapter for help with common installation problems), you see the mes-
sage shown in Figure 3-3.
	
2.	Click the Create a Configuration File button.
	
	 The Welcome to WordPress page, which gives you the information you 
need to proceed with the installation, opens.
	
3.	Click the Let’s Go button at the bottom of the page.

34
Part I: Establishing a WordPress Foundation 
Figure 3-3: WordPress prompts you to create a configuration file.
	
4.	Dig out the database name, username, and password that you saved 
earlier (see the “Setting up the MySQL database” section, earlier in 
this chapter), and then use that information to fill in the following 
fields, as shown in Figure 3-4:
	
•	Database Name: Type the database name you used when you cre-
ated the MySQL database before this installation. Because hosts 
differ in configurations, you need to enter either the database 
name or the database name with your hosting account username 
appended.
	
	If you named your database wordpress, for example, you’d enter 
that in this text box. Or if your host requires you to append the 
database name with your hosting account username, you’d enter 
username_wordpress, substituting your hosting username for 
username. My username is lisasabin, so I entered lisasabin_
wordpress.
	
•	User Name: Type the username you used when you created the 
MySQL database before this installation. Depending on what your 
host requires, you may need to append this username to your 
hosting account username.
	
•	Password: Type the password you used when you set up the 
MySQL database. You don’t need to append the password to your 
hosting account username here.
	
•	Database Host: Ninety-nine percent of the time, leave this field set 
to localhost. Some hosts, depending on their configurations, have 
different hosts set for the MySQL database server. If localhost 

35
 Chapter 3: Installing WordPress on Your Web Server
doesn’t work, contact your hosting provider to find out the MySQL 
database host.
	
•	Table Prefix: Leave this field set to wp_.
	
	 It’s acceptable practice to leave the database table prefix to the default: 
wp_. However, if you want a bit more security on your WordPress install, 
set the database table prefix to something unique because people are 
out there on the Internet making attempts to hack WordPress databases, 
and one of the first things they check for is the default database table 
prefix. If you set this to a unique prefix, it becomes impossible for anyone 
to access your database unless they know your prefix. For example, I 
would set mine to something like: lswwp_. This practice isn’t necessary, 
but it’s recommended for a more secure WordPress installation.
	
5.	After you have all that information filled in, click the Submit button.
	
	 You see a message that says, “All right, sparky! You’ve made it through 
this part of the installation. WordPress can now communicate with your 
database. If you’re ready, time now to run the install!”
	
6.	Click the Run the Install button.
	
	You see another welcome page with a message welcoming you to the 
famous five-minute WordPress installation process, as shown in Figure 3-5.
Figure 3-4: Enter the database name, username, and password.

36
Part I: Establishing a WordPress Foundation 
Figure 3-5: Information is needed to finish the WordPress installation.
	
7.	Enter or change the following information:
	
•	Site Title: Enter the title you want to give your site. The title you 
enter isn’t written in stone; you can change it at a later date, if  
you like.
	
•	Username: This is the name you use to log in to WordPress. By 
default, the username is admin, and you can leave it that way. 
However, for security reasons, I recommend you change your  
username to something unique to you.
	
•	Password, Twice: Type your desired password in the first text box 
and then type it again in the second text box to confirm that you’ve 
typed it correctly. If the two versions of your password don’t match, 
WordPress alerts you with an error message. If you don’t enter a 
password, one is generated automatically for you.

37
 Chapter 3: Installing WordPress on Your Web Server
	
	For security reasons (and so other people can’t make a lucky 
guess), passwords need to be at least seven characters long with 
as many different characters in as many combinations as possible. 
Use a mixture of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and 
symbols, such as ! “ ? $ % ^ &.
	
•	Your E-mail: Enter the e-mail address you want to use to be notified 
of administrative information about your website. You can change 
this address at a later date, too.
	
•	Allow search engines to index this site: By default this check box is 
selected, which lets the search engines index the contents of your 
website and include your website in search results. To keep your 
website out of the search engines, deselect this check box.
	
8.	Click the Install WordPress button.
	
	 The WordPress installation machine works its magic and creates all 
the tables within the database that contain the default data for your 
website. WordPress displays the login information you need to access 
the WordPress Dashboard. Make note of this username and password 
before you leave this page; scribble it on a piece of paper or copy it into 
a text editor such as Notepad.
	
	 After you click the Install WordPress button, WordPress sends you an 
e-mail with the login information and login URL. This information is handy 
if you’re called away during this part of the installation process. So go 
ahead and let the dog out, answer the phone, brew a cup of coffee, or take 
a 15-minute power nap. If you somehow get distracted from the page dis-
playing your username and password, the e-mail sent to you contains the 
information you need to successfully log in to your WordPress website.
	
9.	Click the Log In button to log in to WordPress.
	
	 If you happen to lose the login page before clicking the Log In button, 
you can always find your way to the login page by entering your domain 
followed by the call to the login file (for example, http://yourdomain.
com/wp-login.php).
	
	 You know that you’re finished with the installation process when you see 
the login page, as shown in Figure 3-6. Check out Table 3-1 if you experi-
ence any problems during this installation process; it covers some of the 
common problems users run into.
So do tell — how much time does your watch show for the installation? Was 
it five minutes? Stop by my blog (http://lisasabin-wilson.com) some-
time and let me know whether WordPress stood up to its famous five minute-
installation reputation. I’m a curious sort.

The good news is — you’re done! Were you expecting a marching band?

duce it, the folks at WordPress can.

Discovering WordPress Release Cycles
In Chapter 1, I introduce the concept of open-source software (OSS) and dis-
cuss how the WordPress development community is made up of, primarily, 
volunteer developers who donate their time and talents to the WordPress 
platform. The development of WordPress is a collaborative effort, and with 
each new release, you can count sometimes more than 300 developers who 
have contributed in one way or another.
The publicly stated schedule for new WordPress releases is, roughly, once 
every 120 days, so you can expect a new release of the WordPress software 
about three times per year. I’ve used WordPress since 2003, and in those ten 
years, the WordPress development team has stuck to that schedule pretty 
closely, with only some exceptions here and there. When WordPress makes 
exceptions to its 120-day rule, it usually makes a public announcement so 
that users know what to expect and the estimated time frame for the new 
release.

40
Part I: Establishing a WordPress Foundation 
Interruptions in that 120-day schedule can — and do — happen, mainly 
because the development of WordPress is primarily on a volunteer basis. 
Only a few developers actually get paid to develop for WordPress — 
and those are employees of Automattic, the company behind the hosted 
WordPress.com service. Because of the volunteer nature of the development 
crew, the progress of WordPress development depends on volunteer devel-
opers making time in their schedules to work on the software in a timely 
manner. Generally, they do, and you can count on new updates to WordPress 
on a regular basis.
From a practical standpoint, you can expect to update your WordPress instal-
lation at least three, if not four, times per year.
Understanding why you need to upgrade regularly
Don’t get discouraged by how many times you need to upgrade your WordPress 
installation in a year. The WordPress development team constantly strives to 
improve the user experience and bring exciting and fun new features to the 
WordPress platform. With each new upgrade, you find improved security and 
new features that you can use to improve the experience on your website.
The following list provides some reasons why upgrading your WordPress 
installation is important and something every WordPress website owner 
needs to do every time a new version is released:
	
✓	Security: As WordPress versions come and go, outdated versions are no 
longer supported and are the most vulnerable to malicious attacks and 
hacker attempts. If you’ve heard anything negative about WordPress 
security, 99.99 percent of the time it’s because the users were using an 
outdated version on their websites. To make sure you have the most up-
to-date and secure version running, make sure you upgrade to the latest 
version as soon as you can.
	
✓	New features: With major WordPress releases, you always find great new 
features and tools that improve your experience, boost your efficiency 
and productivity in maintaining your website, improve your visitors’ expe-
riences, and are fun to use. (See the sidebar “Major versus point releases,” 
later in the chapter.) Upgrading your WordPress installation ensures 
you always have access to the latest and greatest tools and features that 
WordPress has to offer.
	
✓	Plugins and themes: Most plugin and theme developers work hard to 
make sure their products are up- to- date and compatible with the latest 
WordPress version. Therefore, plugin and theme developers generally 
don’t worry about backward compatibility, or working with out-of-date 
WordPress versions, because keeping their products relevant to the 
www.allitebooks.com

41
 Chapter 3: Installing WordPress on Your Web Server
current WordPress version is challenging enough. To be sure that the 
plugins and themes you use are current and don’t break any of the 
features on your site (for example, they stop working or cause errors), 
make sure you use the latest WordPress version and the latest version 
of your chosen plugins and themes.
Examining release cycles
By the time you upgrade to the latest WordPress installation, that installation 
has gone through several iterations, or versions, before it lands in your hands. 
This section helps you understand what it takes to get the latest version to 
your website, and the terminology used, so when you see it bantered about 
in blogs and Twitter posts, you at least know the basics of what people are 
talking about.
The steps and terminology involved in the release of a new version of 
WordPress include the following:
	
✓	Alpha: This is the first phase of the new version, typically the idea 
phase in which developers gather ideas from one another, from users, 
and from community members. During the alpha phase, developers 
determine which features to include in the new release and develop an 
outline and project plan. After features are decided, developers develop 
and testers test until they reach the feature freeze — the point in the 
development cycle when all new features are considered complete and 
the development moves on to the beta cycle in which developers perfect 
new features through user testing and bug fixes.
	
✓	Beta: This cycle is in place to fix bugs and any problems reported by 
testers. Beta cycles can last 4–6 weeks, if not more, and many times, 
WordPress releases several beta versions that look something like 
WordPress version 3.0 Beta, WordPress version 3.0 Beta 1, and so on. 
This continues until the development team decides that the software is 
ready to move into the next phase of the development cycle.
	
✓	Release candidate (RC): A version is issued as a release candidate when 
it’s been determined that the bugs from the beta versions have been 
fixed and the version is almost ready for the final release. You can some-
times see several iterations referred to as RC-1, RC-2, and so on.
	
✓	Final release: When a version has gone through full testing in several 
(hopefully all) types of environments (browser systems, different web 
server configurations, and so on) and user experiences; when no major 
bugs are reported; and when all bugs from the alpha, beta, and RC 
phases have been squashed; the development team releases the final 
version of the WordPress software.

42
Part I: Establishing a WordPress Foundation 
After a version is issued as a final release, the WordPress development team 
starts all over again in the alpha phase, gearing up to go through the develop-
ment cycle again, ready for the next major version.
Typically, one development cycle lasts approximately 120 days, but any 
number of things can happen during a development cycle, from developer 
delays to particularly difficult bugs that take longer to fix than expected. 
Legend has it that during the 3.0 development cycle, the final release was 
delayed by several weeks because of a kitten that required lots of time and 
TLC (http://cheezburger.com/View/3444964352).
Keeping Track of WordPress Development
If you know where to look, keeping track of the development cycle of a 
WordPress project is pretty easy because the development team tries to 
make the development process transparent. Not only can you keep track 
by reading about the cycle in various spots on the Internet, but you can 
also eavesdrop on the conversations between developers and, if you feel so 
inclined, jump in and lend a hand where you can.
Major versus point releases
Notice that when you install your first 
WordPress version and when you make sub-
sequent upgrades with each new release, 
WordPress versions are numbered. These 
numbers show the progress of the software 
development, but the numbers are also soft-
ware versioning, which is a method of assign-
ing unique numbers to each version release. 
Regardless of the version number, whenever 
WordPress puts out a new release, you should 
always upgrade to keep your WordPress soft-
ware as up to date as possible.
	✓	Point release: Point releases usually only 
increase numerically by a point or two, indi-
cating that it’s a relatively minor release and 
includes things like minor bug fixes. For exam-
ple, when the version number jumps from 3.0 
to 3.0.1, you can be pretty certain that the new 
version (3.0.1) was released to fix existing 
minor bugs or cleanups in the source code, 
rather than to add new features.
	✓	Major release: A major release most often 
contains new features, and you generally 
see a large jump in version numbers. For 
example, when WordPress went from 2.9 
to 3.0, it was considered a major release 
because it jumped a whole number, rather 
than incrementally increasing by decimal 
points (although version 2.9 did get ver-
sioned into 2.9.1 and 2.9.2 before it jumped 
to 3.0). This large jump is a sign that this 
version includes a few new features, rather 
than just bug fixes or code cleanup. The 
larger the jump in version number, the more 
major the release. For example, if a version 
number suddenly jumped from 3.0 to 3.5, 
that would be an indication of some pretty 
major new features in that release.

Managing Content with 
WordPress
In This Chapter
▶	Archiving your content
▶	Working with permalinks
▶	Feeding your readers with RSS
W
 
ordPress provides you with many ways to organize, categorize, and 
archive content on your website or blog (or both!). Packaged within 
the WordPress software is the capability for you to maintain chronological and 
categorized archives of your publishing history, enabling your website visitors 
to easily find and read the content they’re interested in. WordPress uses PHP 
and MySQL technology to sort and organize everything you publish in an order 
that you, and your readers, can access by date and category. This archiving 
process is done automatically with every post you publish to your blog.
In this chapter, you find out all about WordPress archiving, from categories 
to tags and more. You also discover how to take advantage of the built-in 
permalink system that creates Search Engine Optimization–friendly perma-
links for your site. Finally, this chapter takes you through all the types of 
content you can build within WordPress. When people refer to content, they 
assume you mean posts and pages that you publish, which is true; but there 
are other types of content and ways to organize it that help you build a more 
dynamic and informative website.
Archiving Content with WordPress
When you create a post on your WordPress site, you can file that post under 
a category that you specify. This feature makes for a very nifty archiving 
system in which you and your readers can find articles/posts that you’ve 

46
Part I: Establishing a WordPress Foundation 
placed within a specific category. Articles that you post are also sorted and 
organized by date (day/month/year) to make it easy to locate articles that 
you’ve posted at a certain time. The archives page on my business website 
(see it at http://webdevstudios.com/sitemap) contains a list of pages, 
a list of months content was published in, and a list of topics. Clicking a 
month on that page, for example, takes you to a page listing articles from that 
month, which are linked to the individual articles, as shown in Figure 4-1.
Figure 4-1: An archive listing of posts made in January 2013.
Dates and categories aren’t the only ways WordPress archives and organizes 
your content. There are several others as well, and in this chapter, I give you 
an overview of them. In later chapters in this book, I show you how you can 
leverage those archive types to create a dynamic website that’s easy for your 
visitors to navigate. The different types of archives and content include
	
✓	Categories: Create categories of topics to file your articles in to create 
easy archiving of relevant topics. A popular way that websites display 

47
 Chapter 4: Managing Content with WordPress
content is by category — typically referred to as a Magazine Theme — 
where all content is displayed by topic, rather than a simple chronological 
listing. An example of a Magazine Theme (the Modern Blogger by StartBox 
at http://demo.wpstartbox.com/?theme=modern-blogger) is 
shown in Figure 4-2.
	
	You can find out how to create a theme of your own by using the infor-
mation in Part III of this book, which deals with WordPress themes; also 
be sure to check out Chapter 12 to discover how to use template tags to 
display category-specific content — exciting stuff!
	
✓	Tags: Tagging your posts with micro-keywords, or tags, helps drill down 
related content, which is good for search engine optimization (SEO) pur-
poses, and also provides additional navigation pieces for your readers 
to find relevant content on your site. See the sidebar “What are tags, and 
how/why do you use them?” later in this chapter, to find out how tags 
differ from categories.
Figure 4-2: An example of a Magazine Theme created with WordPress.

48
Part I: Establishing a WordPress Foundation 
	
✓	Date based: Your content is automatically archived by date based on 
the day, month, year, and time you published it.
	
✓	Author: Content is automatically archived by author based on the 
author of the post and/or page. Creating an author archive is possible 
for those sites that have multiple content contributors.
	
✓	Keyword (or search): WordPress has a built-in search function that 
allows you, and your readers, to search for keywords to see an archive 
listing of content that’s relevant to your chosen keyword.
	
✓	Custom post types: You can build custom post types based on the kind 
of content your site offers — you can find more information on this topic 
in Chapter 12.
	
✓	Attachments: WordPress has a built-in media library where you upload 
different media files such as photos, images, documents, videos, and 
audio files (to name a few). You can build an archive of those files to create 
things like photo galleries, e-book archives (PDFs), or video galleries.
Building categories
In WordPress, a category is what you determine to be the main topic of a blog 
post. Through categories, you can file your blog posts into topics by subject.  
To improve your readers’ experiences in navigating through your blog, 
WordPress organizes posts by the categories you assign to them. Visitors can 
click the categories they’re interested in to see the blog posts you’ve written 
on those particular topics. You should know ahead of time that the list of cat-
egories you set up can be displayed on your blog in a few places, including the
	
✓	Body of the post: In most WordPress themes, you see the title followed 
by a statement, such as “Filed In: Category 1, Category 2.” The reader can 
click the category name to go to a page that lists all the posts you’ve 
made in that particular category. You can assign a single post to more 
than one category.
	
✓	Sidebar of your blog theme: You can place a full list of category titles in 
the sidebar by using the Categories widget included in your WordPress 
installation. (Widgets are covered in Chapter 12.) A reader can click any 
category and go to a page on your site that lists the posts you’ve made 
within that particular category.
Subcategories (or category children) can further refine the main category 
topic by listing specific topics related to the main (parent) category. In 
your WordPress Dashboard on the Manage Categories page (choose 
Posts➪Categories), subcategories are listed directly below the main cat-
egory. Here’s an example:

49
 Chapter 4: Managing Content with WordPress
Books I Enjoy (main category)
   Fiction (subcategory)
   Nonfiction (subcategory)
   Trashy Romance (subcategory)
   Biographies (subcategory)
   For Dummies (subcategory)
Changing the name of a category
Upon installation, WordPress gives you one default category — Uncategorized — 
as shown on the Categories page in Figure 4-3. That category name is pretty 
generic, so you definitely want to change it to one that’s more specific to you. 
(On my blog, I changed it to Life in General. Although that name’s still a bit on 
the generic side, it doesn’t sound quite so . . . well, uncategorized.)
Figure 4-3: The Categories page in the Dashboard of a brand-new blog shows the default  
Uncategorized category.

50
Part I: Establishing a WordPress Foundation 
	
The default category also serves as kind of a fail-safe. If you publish a post to 
your blog and don’t assign that post to a category, WordPress automatically 
assigns that post to the default category, no matter what you name the  
category.
So how do you change the name of that default category? When you’re logged 
in to your WordPress Dashboard, just follow these steps:
	
1.	Choose Posts➪Categories.
	
	 The Categories page opens, containing all the tools you need to set up 
and edit category titles for your blog.
	
2.	Click the title of the category you want to edit.
	
	For example, if you want to change the Uncategorized category, click  
the Uncategorized link. The Edit Category page appears, as shown in 
Figure 4-4.
	
3.	Type the new name for the category in the Name text box and then type 
the new slug in the Slug text box.
	
	 Slug refers to the word(s) used in the web address for the specific  
category. For example, the Books category has a web address of
http://yourdomain.com/category/books
	
	 If you change the slug to Books I Like, the web address is
http://yourdomain.com/category/books-i-like
What are tags, and how/why do you use them?
Tags are not to be confused with categories, but 
a lot of people do confuse them. Tags are click-
able, comma-separated keywords that help you 
microcategorize a post by defining the topics in 
it. Unlike WordPress categories, tags do not 
have a hierarchy; there are no parent tags and 
child tags. If you write a post about your dog, 
for example, you can put that post in the Pets 
category — but you can also add some specific 
tags that let you get a whole lot more specific, 
such as poodle, or small dogs. If visitors 
click your poodle tag, they find all the posts 
you’ve ever made that contain the poodle tag.
Another reason to use tags: When they crawl 
your site, search-engine spiders harvest tags, 
so tags help other people find your site when 
they search for specific keywords.
You can manage your tags in the WordPress 
Dashboard by choosing Posts➪Tags. The Tags 
page opens where you can view, edit, delete, 
and add new tags.

 Chapter 4: Managing Content with WordPress
Figure 4-4: Edit a category in WordPress on the Edit Category page.
	
	 WordPress automatically inserts a dash between the slug words in the 
web address.
	
4.	Choose a parent category from the Parent drop-down list.
	
	 If you want this category to be a main category, not a subcategory, 
choose None.
	
5.	(Optional) Type a description of the category in the Description text box.
	
	 Use this description to remind yourself what your category is about. 
Some WordPress themes display the category description on your site, 
which can be helpful for your visitors. You’ll know whether your theme 
is coded in this way if your site displays the category description on the 
category page(s). (See Part III of this book for more about themes.)
	
6.	Click the Update button.
	
	 The information you just edited is saved, and the Categories page 
reloads, showing your new category name.

52
Part I: Establishing a WordPress Foundation 
Creating new categories
Today, tomorrow, next month, next year — as your blog grows in size and 
age, you’ll continue adding new categories to further define and archive the 
history of your blog posts. You aren’t limited in the number of categories and 
subcategories you can create in your blog.
Creating a new category is as easy as following these steps:
	
1.	Choose Posts➪Categories.
	
	 The Categories page opens. The left side of the Categories page displays 
the Add New Category section, shown in Figure 4-5.
	
2.	Type the name of your new category in the Name text box.
	
	 Suppose that you want to create a category in which you file all your 
posts about the books you read. In the Name text box, type something 
like Books I Enjoy.
Figure 4-5: Create a new category on your blog.

53
 Chapter 4: Managing Content with WordPress
	
3.	Type a name in the Slug text box.
	
	 The slug creates the link to the category page that lists all the posts you’ve 
made in this category. If you leave this field blank, WordPress automati-
cally creates a slug based on the category name. If the category is Books I 
Enjoy, WordPress automatically creates a category slug like this:
http://yourdomain.com/category/books-i-enjoy
	
4.	Choose the category’s parent from the Parent drop-down list.
	
	 Choose None if you want this new category to be a parent (or top-level) 
category. If you want this category to be a subcategory of another cat-
egory, choose the category you want to be the parent of this one.
	
5.	(Optional) Type a description of the category in the Description  
text box.
	
6.	Click the Add New Category button.
	
	 That’s it — you’ve added a new category to your blog. Armed with this 
information, you can add an unlimited number of categories to your blog.
You can delete a category on your blog by hovering your mouse pointer over 
the title of the category you want to delete, and then clicking the Delete link 
that appears underneath the category title.
	
Deleting a category doesn’t delete the posts and links in that category. Instead, 
posts in the deleted category are assigned to the Uncategorized category (or 
whatever you’ve named the default category).
	
If you have an established WordPress blog with categories already created, 
you can convert some or all of your categories to tags. To do so, look for the 
Category to Tag Converter link on the right side of the Categories page (refer 
to Figure 4-3) — click it to convert your categories to tags. (See the earlier 
sidebar “What are tags, and how/why do you use them?” for more informa-
tion on tags.)
The WP_Query(); class (described in Chapter 12) enables you to take 
advantage of categories in WordPress to build a dynamic theme that displays 
your content in a way that highlights the different topics available on your 
site. In Chapter 12, you also find out how to use WordPress template tags to 
manipulate category archives for display and distribution on your website.

54
Part I: Establishing a WordPress Foundation 
Using static page parents and children
People use the Pages feature on their sites to create static content (content 
that does not often change), such as an About Me or Contact Me page. Click 
the Pages menu in the WordPress Dashboard to reveal the submenu links:
	
✓	Edit: This link opens the Edit Pages screen where you can search, view, 
edit, and delete pages in your WordPress site.
	
✓	Add New: This link opens the Add New Page screen where you can  
compose, save, and publish a new page on your blog.
Pages are different from posts on a WordPress website because users typically 
create a smaller amount of pages with static content, whereas when users 
have a blog on their site, they are, generally, adding blog posts regularly. 
WordPress separates posts from pages to distinguish the two types of 
content. Table 4-1 illustrates the differences between a post and a page in 
WordPress.

WordPress allows pages to have a hierarchal structure, which can be helpful 
in your navigation plans for your site, as well as grouping together pages that 
relate to one another topically.
For example, I can create an About Me page that contains a brief biography 
of me as an author, designer, and public speaker. This About Me page is con-
sidered a parent page because it’s a top-level page created at, for example, 
http://yourdomain.com/about. Then, I can create child pages underneath 
the parent page that relate to it, in terms of content. For example, I can create 
three pages: Design, Books, and Speaking. Each of those pages contains 
expanded content about each topic, individually. The navigation structure 
would look something like this:

55
 Chapter 4: Managing Content with WordPress
   About Me (http://yourdomain.com/about)
   Design (http://yourdomain.com/about/design)
   Books (http://yourdomain.com/about/books)
   Speaking (http://yourdomain.com/about/speaking)
You can see where the grouping of those pages together as parent/child pages 
makes sense from a navigation perspective and a content delivery perspec-
tive. In Chapter 10, you find out how to build custom navigation menus using 
the built-in menu feature in WordPress. In Chapter 12, you discover how to 
use WordPress template tags to call different menus into your themes, and 
in Chapter 14, you find some CSS tips and tricks that help you style those 
menus to your satisfaction.
Customizing Permalinks
Each WordPress blog post is assigned its own web page, and the address (or 
URL) of that page is a permalink. Posts that you see in WordPress blogs usu-
ally have the post permalink in four typical areas:
	
✓	The title of the blog post
	
✓	The Comments link below the post
	
✓	A Permalink link that appears (in most themes) below the post
	
✓	The titles of posts in a Recent Posts sidebar
Permalinks are meant to be permanent links to your blog posts (which is 
where perma comes from, in case you’re wondering). Other bloggers can use 
a post permalink to refer to that particular blog post. So ideally, the perma-
link of a post never changes. WordPress creates the permalink automatically 
when you publish a new post.
By default, a blog post permalink in WordPress looks like this:
http://yourdomain.com/?p=100/
The p stands for post, and 100 is the ID assigned to the individual post. You 
can leave the permalinks in this format, if you don’t mind letting WordPress 
associate each post with an ID number.
WordPress, however, lets you take your permalinks to the beauty salon for a 
bit of a makeover so you can create pretty permalinks. I bet you didn’t know 
that permalinks could be pretty, did you? They certainly can. Allow me to 
explain.

56
Part I: Establishing a WordPress Foundation 
Making your post links pretty
Pretty permalinks are links that are more pleasing to the eye than standard 
links and, ultimately, more pleasing to search engine spiders. (See Chapter 15 
for an explanation of why search engines like pretty permalinks.) Pretty per-
malinks look something like this:
http://yourdomain.com/2008/01/01/pretty-permalinks/
Break down that URL, and you see the date when the post was made, in year/
month/day format. You also see the topic of the post.
To choose how your permalinks look, choose Settings➪Permalinks. The 
Permalink Settings page opens, as shown in Figure 4-6.
Figure 4-6: Make your permalinks pretty.
On this page, you find several options for creating permalinks:
	
✓	Default (ugly permalinks): WordPress assigns an ID number to each 
blog post and creates the URL in this format: http://yourdomain.
com/?p=100.
	
✓	Day and Name (pretty permalinks): For each post, WordPress generates 
a permalink URL that includes the year, month, day, and post slug/title: 
http://yourdomain.com/2008/01/01/sample-post/.

57
 Chapter 4: Managing Content with WordPress
	
✓	Month and Name (pretty permalinks): For each post, WordPress gener-
ates a permalink URL that includes the year, month, and post slug/title: 
http://yourdomain.com/2008/01/sample-post/.
	
✓	Numeric (not so pretty): WordPress assigns a numerical value to the 
permalink. The URL is created in this format: http://yourdomain.
com/archives/123.
	
✓	Post Name (recommended): WordPress takes the title of the post or the 
page and turns it into a permalink slug like this: 
http://yourdomain.com/post-name
	
✓	Custom Structure: WordPress creates permalinks in the format you 
choose. You can create a custom permalink structure by using tags or 
variables, as I discuss in the next section.
To create the pretty-permalink structure, select the Day and Name (or Month 
and Name) radio button; then click the Save Changes button at the bottom of 
the page.
	
For optimization reasons, my preferred permalink structure is Post Name, 
which uses the tag %postname% in the Custom Structure field found on the 
Permalink Settings page (refer to Figure 4-6). I prefer this structure because 
it strips all the date information and leaves only the post name, or slug, itself. 
For example, using the Day and Name structure for my permalinks, my posts’ 
permalinks look like this: http://lisasabin-wilson.com/2013/06/02/
post-title/; however, if I use my preferred method of %postname%, my 
permalinks look like this: http://lisasabin-wilson.com/post-name. 
See how it shortens the permalink URL considerably? This is a better method 
for search engine optimization, and it just looks better.
Customizing your permalinks
A custom permalink structure lets you define which variables you want to see 
in your permalinks by using the tags listed in Table 4-2.
Table 4-2

%category%
The text of the category name that you filed the post in 
(such as books-i-read)
%author%

wilson)
If you want your permalink to show the year, month, day, category, and post 
name, select the Custom Structure radio button in the Permalink Settings 
page and type the following tags in the Custom Structure text box:
/%year%/%monthnum%/%day%/%category%/%postname%/
Under this permalink format, the link for the WordPress For Dummies post 
made on February 1, 2008, filed in the Books I Read category, would look  
like this:
http://yourdomain.com/2008/02/01/books-i-read/wordpress-for-dummies/
	
Be sure to include the slashes before tags, between tags, and at the very 
end of the string of tags. This format ensures that WordPress creates cor-
rect, working permalinks by using the correct re_write rules located in the 
.htaccess file for your site. (See the following section for more information 
on re_write rules and .htaccess files.)
	
Changing the structure of your permalinks in the future affects the perma-
links for all the posts on your blog . . . new and old. Keep this fact in mind if 
you ever decide to change the permalink structure. An especially important 
reason: Search engines (such as Google and Yahoo!) index the posts on your 
site by their permalinks, so changing the permalink structure makes all those 
indexed links obsolete.
Don’t forget to click the Save Changes button at the bottom of the Permalink 
Settings page; otherwise, your permalink changes won’t be saved!

59
 Chapter 4: Managing Content with WordPress
Making sure that your permalinks  
work with your server
After you set the format for the permalinks for your site by using any options 
other than the default, WordPress writes specific rules, or directives, to the 
.htaccess file on your web server. The .htaccess file communicates to 
your web server how it should serve up the permalinks, according to the  
permalink structure you’ve chosen to use.
To use an .htaccess file, you need to know the answers to two questions:
	
✓	Does your web server configuration use and give you access to the 
.htaccess file?
	
✓	Does your web server run Apache with the mod_rewrite module?
If you don’t know the answers, contact your hosting provider to find out.
If the answer to both questions is yes, proceed to the next section. If the 
answer is no, skip to the “Working with servers that don’t use Apache  
mod_rewrite” section.
Creating .htaccess files
You and WordPress work together in glorious harmony to create the  
.htaccess file that lets you use a pretty permalink structure in your blog. 
To create an .htaccess file on your web server and set the correct permis-
sions for it, follow these steps:
	
1.	Using a plain-text editor, such as Notepad (Windows) or TextMate 
(http://macromates.com) (Mac), create a blank file, name it  
htaccess.txt, and upload it to your web server via FTP.
	
	 You may not have to create the file (as instructed in Step 1); if the 
.htaccess file already exists, you can find it in the root of your direc-
tory on your web server — that is, the same directory where you find 
your wp-config.php file. If you don’t see the file in the root direc-
tory, try changing the options of your FTP client to show hidden files. 
(Because the .htaccess file starts with a period, it may not be visible 
until you configure your FTP client to show hidden files. See Chapter 5 
for details.)
	
2.	After the file is uploaded to your web server, rename the file .htaccess 
(notice the period at the beginning) and make sure that it’s writable 
by the server by changing permissions to either 755 or 777.
	
	 See Chapter 5 for information about FTP and details on changing permis-
sions on server files.

60
Part I: Establishing a WordPress Foundation 
	
3.	Create the permalink structure in the Permalink Settings page on your 
WordPress Dashboard.
	
	 See the section “Making your post links pretty,” earlier in this chapter.
	
4.	Click the Save Changes button at the bottom of the Permalink Settings 
page.
	
	 WordPress inserts into the .htaccess file the specific rules necessary 
for making the permalink structure functional in your blog.
Now you have an .htaccess file on your web server that has the correct 
permissions set so that WordPress can write the correct rules to it. Your 
pretty permalink structure works flawlessly. Kudos!
If you open the .htaccess file and look at it now, it’s no longer blank. The 
file should have a set of rewrite rules code, which looks something like this:
# BEGIN WordPress
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule . /index.php [L]
</IfModule>
# END WordPress
	
I could delve deeply into .htaccess and all the things you can do with this 
file, but I’m restricting this section to how it applies to WordPress permalink 
structures. If you want to unlock more mysteries about .htaccess, check 
out http://javascriptkit.com/howto/htaccess.shtml.
Working with servers that don’t use Apache mod_rewrite
Using permalink structures requires that your web hosting provider has a 
specific Apache module option — mod_rewrite — activated on its servers. 
If your web hosting provider doesn’t have this option activated on its servers 
or if you’re hosting your site on a Windows server, the custom permalinks 
work only if you type /index.php in front of any custom permalink tags.
For example, create the custom permalink tags like this:
/index.php/%year%/%month%/%date%/%postname%/
This format creates a permalink like this:
http://yourdomain.com/index.php/2008/02/01/wordpress-for-dummies
You don’t need an .htaccess file to use this permalink structure.

Through my experiences over the years, Yahoo! hosting doesn’t allow users 
access to the .htaccess file on their servers, and it doesn’t use mod_
rewrite. So if you’re hosting on Yahoo!, you need to use the custom perma-
link technique that I describe in this section.
Syndicating Your Content with RSS Feeds
RSS stands for really simple syndication. An RSS feed is a standard feature that 
blog readers have come to expect. So what is it, really?
The Introduction to RSS page on WebReference.com (www.webreference.
com/authoring/languages/xml/rss/intro) defines RSS as “a light-
weight XML format designed for sharing headlines and other Web content. 
Think of it as a distributable ‘What’s New’ for your site.”
Introducing feed readers
Users can use feed readers to download your RSS feed. The feed readers are 
set up to automatically discover new content (such as posts and comments) 
from your blog and download that content for users’ consumption. Users can 
download several RSS feed readers, for either a PC or a Mac — and there are 
also popular and accessible online RSS feed readers available on the Internet. 
Feedly (http://feedly.com) a free RSS reader with applications for the 
Chrome browser, iPhones, and so on, is a popular online RSS reader on the 
web. With Feedly, readers can keep up with their favorite blogs and websites 
that have syndicated (RSS) content.
	
	 Most browser systems alert visitors to the RSS feed on your site by displaying 
the universally recognized orange RSS feed icon, shown here in the margin.
Keep in mind that almost all browser systems have built-in RSS readers. Just 
look for the small RSS icon in the address bar of your favorite browser (such 
as Internet Explorer or Mozilla Firefox) and click it. The RSS feeds you’ve 
saved appear directly in your browser window.
For the readers of your blog to stay updated with the latest and greatest 
content you post to your site, they need to subscribe to your RSS feed. Most 
blogging platforms allow the RSS feeds to be autodiscovered by the various 
feed readers — meaning that the user needs only to enter your site’s URL, 
and the program automatically finds your RSS feed.
WordPress has built-in RSS feeds in several formats. Because the feeds are 
built in to the software platform, you don’t need to do anything to provide 
your readers with an RSS feed of your content.

Part I: Establishing a WordPress Foundation 
Discovering the many WordPress RSS options
RSS feeds come in different flavors, including RSS 0.92, RDF/RSS 1.0, RSS 
2.0, and Atom. The differences among them lie within the base code that 
makes up the functionality of the syndication feed. What’s important is that 
WordPress supports all versions of RSS — which means that anyone can sub-
scribe to your RSS feed with any type of feed reader available.
WordPress is very intuitive, and this section on RSS feeds is a shining exam-
ple of a feature that WordPress automates. WordPress has a built-in feed 
generator that works behind the scenes to create feeds. This feed generator 
creates feeds from your posts, comments, and even categories.
The RSS feed for your blog posts is autodiscoverable — almost all RSS feed 
readers and even some browsers (Firefox, Internet Explorer 8, and Safari, for 
example) automatically detect the RSS feed URL for a WordPress blog. Table 
4-3 gives you some guidelines on how to find the RSS feed URLs for the differ-
ent sections of your blog.
Table 4-3	
URLs for Built-In WordPress Feeds
Feed Type
Example Feed URL
RSS 0.92
http://yourdomain.com/wp-rss.php or 
http://yourdomain.com/?feed=rss
RDF/RSS 1.0
http://yourdomain.com/wp-rss2.php or 
http://yourdomain.com/?feed=rdf
RSS 2.0
http://yourdomain.com/wp-rss2.php or 
http://yourdomain.com/?feed=rss2
Atom
http://yourdomain.com/wp-atom.php or 
http://yourdomain.com/?feed=atom
Comments RSS
http://yourdomain.com/?feed=rss&p=50 
p stands for post, and 50 is the post ID. You can find the 
post ID in the Dashboard by clicking the Posts link. 
Category RSS
http://yourdomain.com/wp-rss2.php?cat=50  
cat stands for category, and 50 is the category ID. You 
can find the category ID in the Dashboard by clicking the 
Categories link in the Posts menu.
	
If you’re using custom permalinks (see “Making your post links pretty,” earlier 
in this chapter), you can simply add /feed to the end of any URL on your 
blog to find the RSS feed. Some of your links look similar to these:

63
 Chapter 4: Managing Content with WordPress
	
✓	http://yourdomain.com/feed: Your main RSS feed
	
✓	http://yourdomain.com/comments/feed: Your comments RSS feed
	
✓	http://yourdomain.com/tag/tag-name/feed: RSS feed for a tag
	
✓	http://yourdomain.com/category/cat-name/feed: RSS feed for a 
category
Try adding /feed with any URL on your site. You get the RSS feed for that 
page.
RSS feeds are important parts of delivering content from your blog to your 
readers. RSS feeds are expected these days, so the fact that WordPress has 
taken care of the feeds for you, is compliant with all RSS formats, and offers 
so many internal feeds, gives the software a huge advantage over any of the 
other blog-software platforms.
	
If you intend to use the Atom publishing protocol, you need to enable 
it manually because it’s disabled by default. On the Dashboard, choose 
Settings➪Writing, and then select the two check boxes in the Remote 
Publishing section to enable Atom publishing in WordPress.
Using your RSS feeds with your  
social media accounts
RSS feed technology is an important part of publishing content on a blog or 
website. RSS doesn’t only give your readers an option to subscribe to syn-
dicated content from your website. Website publishers are also involved 
in other social networks that use the RSS feeds from their sites to publish, 
market, and help other Internet browsers discover their content, including
	
✓	Twitter: This very popular social media network is full of would-be visitors 
to websites. Tools, which I outline in Chapter 16, allow you to publish new 
blog posts and content to your Twitter stream, as well. This is a powerful 
marketing tool that many site owners use. (http://twitter.com)
	
✓	Facebook: This is another extremely popular social media community that 
allows you to automatically publish your blog and website content into 
your Facebook profile, which puts your content in front of hundreds of 
eyes within the network. Figure 4-7 shows my personal Facebook profile 
where the content from my business site (http://webdevstudios.com) 
is automatically displayed on my profile page. This happens through 
the magic of sharing my RSS feed from my website with my Facebook 
account. (www.facebook.com)

64
Part I: Establishing a WordPress Foundation 
Figure 4-7: My website RSS feed shared on my Facebook profile.
	
Additionally, WordPress has a handy widget that allows you to display con-
tent from an RSS feed of your choice on your website. You can find more 
information on working with WordPress widgets in Chapter 12.

Browsers, and FTP
In This Chapter
▶	Choosing the right text editor
▶	Discovering different browsers and tools
▶	Choosing an FTP client
▶	Establishing FTP on your hosting account
▶	Connecting to your web server and transferring files with FTP
I
 
 started in web design in 1998 and have learned a great many things during 
my journey through designing my little corner of the web. One thing that’s 
certain is that technology moves at a pretty rapid pace, and if you’re really 
serious about making a career — or even a serious hobby — out of web design, 
you need to keep up. Being a full-time web designer and developer is like 
being back in school because you’re constantly discovering and teaching 
yourself new and emerging technologies.
I’ve also learned that when you sit down at the computer to begin any web 
design project, large or small, it’s vital that you have the right tools at your 
fingertips. Having the right tools makes a world of difference in the quality, 
efficiency, and overall experience in designing a website.
In this chapter, you discover different tools for things like editing HTML, CSS, 
and PHP. You also explore different web browser platforms, such as Internet 
Explorer and Mozilla Firefox, including tools and add-ons that you can add 
to a browser to make it work better for your web designing needs. Finally, 
you uncover the mysteries of File Transfer Protocol (FTP), including what it 
means, how to use it, and different types of programs that you can use.
In some cases, the tools I mention in this chapter aren’t necessarily required; 
however, you’ll be very thankful when you find tools that make your web 
designing life a lot easier.

68
Part II: Choosing the Right Tools 
Choosing the Right Text Editor for You
In Part III of this book, you dig in to WordPress themes, work with CSS and 
HTML, and type template tags and a bit of PHP. This chapter arms you with 
the tools you need to prepare for a smooth and efficient experience.
Next to reliable ol’ pen and paper, nothing beats a good, solid text editor. I 
admit, I’m a little old school, so for things like grocery lists and jotting down 
ideas, I stick with a pad of paper and a pen. Unfortunately, writing code is dif-
ficult with a pen and paper, and it doesn’t translate very well when I need to 
publish it to the Internet. That’s when a basic text-editor program comes in 
handy. I always have one open on my computer (usually several instances of 
my favored text editor, actually) and use it for writing Cascading Style Sheets 
(CSS) and HTML as well as coding WordPress templates and themes.
	
Make sure that you use a text editor and not a word processor, such as Microsoft 
Word, to write any code because a word processing program automatically 
inserts formatting, characters, and hidden spaces. When you’re writing code, 
the last thing you want is anything but your own code inserted into the  
document — so stick with a basic text editor.
The text editors I describe in this section are programs that you install on 
your computer. Some of them are available only for Windows, and some only 
for Macs — I specify as such in their descriptions.
Notepad (Windows)
Notepad is a basic text editor that you can use to write code without the fuss 
and worry of text formatting. Notepad doesn’t support any special document 
formatting or characters, which makes it great for writing code and web 
documents.
Notepad is the go-to text editor for most Windows users because it’s a Microsoft 
product that’s packaged in every Windows operating system. Often, people 
use Notepad to view and edit text files with the .txt extension, but many 
people, including myself, use it to create basic CSS and HTML files, as well.
Notepad, by default, saves files with a .txt extension. With WordPress tem-
plates and theme files, you typically save files with a .php or .css extension, 
so make sure you save them correctly. To save a file with a .php or .css 
extension with Notepad, follow these quick steps in Windows 7:
	
1.	Choose Start➪All Programs➪Accessories➪Notepad.
	
	 Notepad opens, and you can start typing your code.
	
2.	Create your CSS or PHP document.
	
	 Check out Chapter 14 for details on how to create CSS.

69
 Chapter 5: Exploring Editors, Browsers, and FTP
	
3.	Choose File➪Save As, and then choose the location on your computer 
where you want to save the file.
	
4.	Type the filename, including the extension, in the File Name field.
	
	 In Figure 5-1, the name of my PHP file is header.php. However, if you’re 
saving a CSS document, the extension is .css, such as style.css.
Figure 5-1: Saving a PHP document in Notepad.
	
5.	Choose All Files in the Save as Type drop-down list (see Figure 5-1).
	
	 By default, Notepad wants to save the file with the file type Text 
Documents (*.txt).
	
6.	Leave ANSI chosen in the Encoding field.
	
	 This is default character encoding and is okay to leave as is.
	
7.	Click Save.
Notepad++ (Windows)
Notepad++ is a text editor for Windows and is often referred to as “Notepad 
on steroids” because the interface looks a lot like regular Notepad — but 
that’s where the similarities end. Notepad++ has advanced features such as 
color-coded syntax (see the nearby sidebar “Code syntax highlighting”), code 

70
Part II: Choosing the Right Tools 
indentation, and line numbering, which make it an extremely useful and help-
ful application for writing and editing code. Figure 5-2 demonstrates the code 
syntax formatting of this editor.
Notepad++ supports many programming languages, including the main ones 
you use for this book: CSS, HTML, and PHP. Notepad++ is free open-source 
software (see Chapter 1)! You can download it to your computer from 
http://notepad-plus-plus.org/download.
Figure 5-2: Notepad++ with color-coded syntax.
Code syntax highlighting
Excluding Notepad, all the text editors I mention 
in this chapter are considered syntax editors — 
they follow code syntax highlighting formats for 
different types of code like PHP, JavaScript, 
HTML, and CSS. Notice that lines of code are 
highlighted by different colors, making it easy 
for you to read and separate the type of code 
and markup you’re looking at. The way the 
code executes isn’t affected; the highlighting is 
purely a readability feature that makes reading 
through lines and lines of code easier on the 
eyes and on the brain.

71
 Chapter 5: Exploring Editors, Browsers, and FTP
TextMate (Mac)
TextMate is an Apple product and, as such, can be used only on a Mac. 
TextMate is the most popular text editor for Mac and is referred to as “the 
missing editor.” Like Notepad++, TextMate is a syntax editor — it color-codes 
the markup and code that you write and has several features expected of 
most syntax editors, including
	
✓	Easy searching and replacing
	
✓	Auto-indenting and color-coding markup and code
	
✓	Opening several documents, each in their own tab, when applicable
	
✓	Working as an external editor for FTP programs
TextMate isn’t free, however. You can download a free 30-day trial from 
http://macromates.com. After the free trial ends, you can buy a single-
user license for $56.
Understanding and Choosing a Web Browser
Knowing which web browser to use as your primary browser can be con-
fusing because so many are available. Everyone has their favorite browser, 
and if you don’t already, one will emerge as your favorite for one reason or 
another. Each browser system has a different look and feel as well as differ-
ent features and tools. You’ll find that a certain browser’s features and tools 
will make it your preferred browser for your personal browsing experience.
One thing you need to keep in mind, however, is that you must have access 
to all major browsers so that you can test and view your web designs in dif-
ferent browsers to make sure they render and look the same.
	
If you can, download and install all the browsers I discuss in this section so 
you have them at your fingertips to test your designs across the systems. 
Some browsers are system-specific (either only for Windows or only for 
Macs), so use the ones that are for your system.
Discovering browsers and tools
A multitude of browser systems are available on the web. This section takes 
you through five major browsers that are the most popular among Internet 
users. Additionally, you find some helpful tools, add-ons, and extensions that 
assist you with your web design efforts in the different browser systems. 
These include some of my favorite and must-have tools I use on a regular 
basis.

72
Part II: Choosing the Right Tools 
As far as the design and development communities are concerned, the choice 
over which web browser to use typically falls on how compliant the browser 
is with open web standards developed by the World Wide Web Consortium 
(W3C), an international community that develops web standards to ensure 
long-term web growth (www.w3.org). As a designer, you should at least have 
a working knowledge of what the W3C is and the standards it supports and 
promotes. You can read about the W3C vision and mission statement at www.
w3.org/consortium/mission.html.
Google Chrome
Google Chrome (www.google.com/chrome) is the most popular web 
browser today, according to W3Schools report on browser statistics and 
trends: www.w3schools.com/browsers/browsers_stats.asp. Chrome 
was developed and released by Internet search giant, Google. Chrome has an 
active development community and has add-ons, or extensions, that you can 
install it easily on your computer on a Mac, Windows, or Linux. 
You can find web development–related extensions for Google Chrome at 
https://chrome.google.com/extensions/featured/Web_dev.
Internet Explorer
Internet Explorer (IE) is by far one of the most popular browsers because it’s 
part and parcel of all Microsoft Windows operating systems. Over the years, 
IE has struggled with its reputation of not keeping up or being compliant with 
web standards and CSS rendering that the development and design com-
munities have come to love and expect from other browser systems. This is 
largely because of the layout engine in use at the foundation of IE. (For more 
on layout engines, see “Understanding cross-browser compatibility,” later in 
this chapter.)
One of the challenges that designers come across is the different versions of 
Internet Explorer that are widely used across the web. With each new ver-
sion, Microsoft’s flagship browser comes closer and closer to compliance 
with open web standards, however. But because IE is the browser present 
with millions of operating systems across the world, not every individual 
user or company is quick to adopt the new versions as they are released. 
This results in several versions of IE in use across the world, and designers 
generally make an effort to ensure their designs render correctly on, at least, 
the last two to three recent versions of IE.
	
Currently, the versions of Internet Explorer that are supported by the major-
ity of designers are versions 8, 9 and 10, with most designers gradually 
dropping support for versions 6 and 7 (commonly referred to as IE6 and IE7, 
respectively). 
Trying to test designs on different versions of Internet Explorer is difficult 
because attempting to install different versions on your computer can cause 

73
 Chapter 5: Exploring Editors, Browsers, and FTP
some big headaches if you don’t know exactly what you’re doing. I use a few 
tools for overall browser testing (see the later section “Understanding cross-
browser compatibility” in this chapter), but a tool called IETester comes 
in handy for specifically testing different IE versions. You can download 
IETester from www.my-debugbar.com/wiki/IETester. In Figure 5-3, but-
tons across the top are labeled for specific IE versions: IE5.5, IE6, IE7, IE8, IE9, 
and IE10. The figure displays the WordPress website in IE7.
Figure 5-3: Test different IE versions with IETester.
Mozilla Firefox
Firefox is the second most popular web browser and has emerged over the 
years as a solid IE competitor. Designers and developers tend to prefer Firefox 
over IE because Mozilla (the makers of Firefox) uses a solid layout engine that 
adheres closely to open web standards and supports and renders CSS better.
Firefox is available for download and use on Windows, Mac, and Linux oper-
ating systems and in more than 70 languages. You can download it from the 
Mozilla website at http://mozilla.com.
One of the main reasons Firefox is my personal browser of choice goes 
beyond the fact that it adheres to open web standards and renders CSS as 
it was meant to be rendered. Firefox is also an open-source software project 

74
Part II: Choosing the Right Tools 
with a vibrant development community that releases very helpful add-ons 
and tools, which extend its capabilities beyond just a web browser, turning it 
into a web development tool, in many cases.
You can find Firefox add-ons at https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox 
for just about everything from the appearance of your Firefox browser to 
browser-based games. 
And the rest
A couple other web browsers are used regularly but aren’t quite as popular 
as Chrome, IE, or Firefox. However, they’re worth checking out:
	
✓	Opera: Opera (www.opera.com) is available for Windows, Mac, and 
Linux and markets itself as fast, secure, and completely in line with 
open web standards, including cutting-edge development languages like 
HTML5 and CSS3. Opera has add-ons available as well, which you can 
find at http://addons.opera.com.
	
✓	Safari: Safari (www.apple.com/safari) is installed on every Mac, from 
large iMacs to MacBook laptops to iPads and iPhones. In short, Safari is 
an Apple product; however, it can also be installed on Windows. Instead 
of a bunch of add-ons that you can download and install for web devel-
opment, Safari has built-in web developer tools, such as
	
•	A developer toolbar with tools for website manipulation, testing, 
and debugging
	
•	A Web Inspector with a wealth of web development tools, includ-
ing an Element pane where you can inspect CSS markup
	
•	A Resources pane that displays a website’s resources by date, size, 
and speed
	
•	A JavaScript Debugger that displays any problems your site is 
experiencing due to JavaScript that is in use
	
•	A Timeline pane that analyzes a website’s behavior over time
	
•	A JavaScript Profiler that lists the performance characteristics of 
scripts that run on a website
	
•	A Console pane for debugging
	
•	A Snippet Editor to test HTML markup
Understanding cross-browser compatibility
Cross-browser compatibility is the practice of testing designs across all major 
browser systems and is important in web design because you don’t just design 
websites for yourself, but for an entire audience on the web. Because you have 

75
 Chapter 5: Exploring Editors, Browsers, and FTP
no idea what browser your audience uses, you must test your designs in all the 
systems to ensure that all your website visitors have the same experience.
The problem that web designers run into with web browsers is that each browser 
system uses a different layout engine (the browser’s underlying code that powers 
the way the browser interprets design language such as CSS and HTML) that 
renders CSS differently. The difference in CSS rendering can sometimes make 
it a real challenge to adjust your CSS styling so that it takes into account 
the different layout engines available. Additionally, not every layout engine 
supports all CSS versions. Table 5-1 illustrates the different layout engines, 
browsers, and CSS versions the layout engine supports to give you an idea 
of what you’re dealing with in different browser systems. You can find more 
information on CSS versions, support, and validation in Chapter 14.
Table 5-1	
Layout Engines, Browser Types,  
	
and CSS Version Support
Layout Engine
Browser System
Supports CSS Version
Gecko
Mozilla Firefox
CSS v1, v2, v3 (partially)
Presto
Opera
CSS v1, v2, v3 (partially)
Trident
Internet Explorer
CSS v1, v2, v3 (slightly)
WebKit
Google Chrome, Safari
CSS v1, v2, v3 (partially)
	
In Table 5-1, partially means that the browser system supports most of the features of the CSS 
version; slightly means that the browser system supports very few features.
The absolute best way to test your website across the major browser systems  
is to download the browsers to your computer and then load your website in 
each browser, checking for correct rendering as you go. However, if you have 
only a Windows computer, you can’t really test your website on a Mac, and 
vice versa. Don’t fret, though, because here are two alternatives that I use 
when I need to test my sites on a browser I don’t have access to:
	
✓	Browsershots: This is an online, browser-based tool. Visit the 
Browsershots website (http://browsershots.org), enter your 
desired web address in the Enter URL Here field at the top of the 
page, and then choose your desired browsers and operating systems. 
Browsershots takes a screenshot of your website in each of the brows-
ers that you indicate so you can see what your website looks like. From 
there, you can fix any problems and retest again, if needed.
	
✓	BrowserStack: BrowserStack is another online cross-browser compat-
ibility testing tool that gives you real- time views of your website using a 
Flash interface. This service is free; however, option premium upgrades 
are available for a cost at http://browserstack.com.

Part II: Choosing the Right Tools 
Introducing File Transfer Protocol (FTP)
Throughout this book, you run into the term File Transfer Protocol (FTP). 
You use FTP to perform various tasks, such as uploading and downloading 
WordPress files, editing files, and changing file permissions.
This section introduces you to the basic FTP elements. The ability to use 
FTP with your hosting account is a given for almost every web host on the 
market. FTP is a way of moving files from one place to another, such as
	
✓	Uploading: Transferring files from your local computer to your web 
server
	
✓	Downloading: Transferring files from your web server to your local 
computer
You can do several other things with FTP:
	
✓	View files: After you log in via FTP, you can see all the files that are 
located on your web server.
	
✓	See dates when files were modified: You can see the date the file(s) 
was last modified, which can sometimes be helpful when troubleshoot-
ing problems.
	
✓	See file sizes: You can see the size of each file on your web server, 
which is helpful especially if you need to manage the disk space on your 
account.
	
✓	Edit files: Almost all FTP clients allow you to open and edit files through 
the client interface, which is a convenient way to get the job done.
	
✓	Change permissions: Commonly referred to as CHMOD (change mode), 
it controls what type of read/write/execute permissions the files on your 
web server have.
Using FTP to transfer files requires an FTP client, or program. Many FTP clients 
are available for download. Following are some good (and free) ones:
	
✓	WS_FTP LE (Windows): www.wsftple.com
	
✓	SmartFTP (Windows): www.smartftp.com/download
	
✓	FileZilla (Windows or Mac): http://sourceforge.net/projects/
filezilla
	
✓	Cyberduck (Windows or Mac): http://cyberduck.ch
	
✓	FTP Explorer (Windows): www.ftpx.com
Your web host gives you a username and password for your account, includ-
ing an FTP IP address. (Usually, the FTP address is the same as your domain 
name, but check with your web host because addresses may vary.) It is this 

77
 Chapter 5: Exploring Editors, Browsers, and FTP
information — the username, password, and FTP IP address — that you 
insert into the FTP program to connect it to your hosting account. (See the 
next section for details on connecting to your web hosting account via FTP.)
Figure 5-4 shows my FTP client connected to my hosting account. The direc-
tory on the left is the listing of files on my computer; the directory on the 
right shows the listing of files on my hosting account.
Files on computer
Files on hosting account
Figure 5-4: Using an FTP client makes file transfers easy.
FTP clients make it easy to transfer files from your computer to your host-
ing account by using a drag-and-drop method. Simply click the file on your 
computer that you want to transfer, drag it over to the side that lists the 
directory on your hosting account, and drop it. Depending on the FTP client 
you’ve chosen to work with, you can refer to its user manuals or support 
documentation for detailed information on how to use the program.
Setting Up FTP on Your Hosting Account
Many web hosts offer FTP as part of their hosting packages, so just confirm 
that your hosting provider makes FTP available to you for your account. In 
Chapter 2, I discuss in detail the specifics of a web- hosting environment, and 
most web hosts provide cPanel — a hosting account management interface. 
cPanel is by far the most popular hosting account management software used 
by many hosts on the web. Others, such as Plesk and Netadmin, are widely 
used as well but aren’t as popular.

78
Part II: Choosing the Right Tools 
	
In this chapter, I use cPanel; if your hosting provider gives you a different 
interface to work with, the concepts are the same, but refer to your hosting 
provider for the specifics to adapt my directions to your specific environment.
By and large, the FTP for your hosting account is set up automatically. Follow 
these few steps to get to the FTP Accounts page, shown in Figure 5-5, to view 
and set up your FTP account:
	
1.	Log in to the cPanel for your hosting account:
	
a.	Browse to http://yourdomain.com/cpanel to bring up the login 
screen for your cPanel (where yourdomain is your actual domain 
name).
	
b.	Enter your specific hosting account username and password in the 
login fields and then click OK.
	
2.	Click the FTP Accounts link and/or icon in your cPanel to open the 
FTP Accounts page, shown in Figure 5-5.
	
3.	Check to see if you have an existing FTP Account.
	
	 If you already have an existing FTP Account, you can skip the rest of the 
steps in this section.
Figure 5-5: The FTP Accounts page within cPanel.

79
 Chapter 5: Exploring Editors, Browsers, and FTP
	
	 If your hosting provider automatically sets you up with an FTP account, 
you see it in the Account Management section. Ninety-nine percent of 
the time, the default FTP account uses the same username and pass-
word combination as your hosting account, or the login information you 
used to log in to your cPanel in Step 1.
	
4.	(Optional) Create a new FTP Account.
	
	 If the FTP Accounts page doesn’t show a default FTP user in the Account 
Management section, create one in the Add FTP Account section with 
these steps:
	
a.	Type your desired username in the Login text field.
 	
	This creates the username of username@yourdomain.com (in 
which username is the desired username you typed and your 
domain.com is your specific domain name).
	
b.	Type your desired password in the Password text field and then 
retype it in the Password (Again) text box to validate it.
 	
	You can either type your own chosen password or click the Password 
Generator button to have the server generate a secure password 
for you.
	
c.	Check the Strength indicator.
 	
	The server tells you whether your password is Very Weak, Weak, 
Good, Strong, or Very Strong, as shown in Figure 5-5. You want a 
Very Strong password for your FTP account so it’s very hard for 
hackers and malicious Internet users to guess and crack.
	
d.	Leave the Directory text box blank.
 	
	Leaving this field blank gives you access to the root level of your 
hosting account, which as the site owner, you want. Therefore, 
leave this field blank. (In the future, if you set up FTP accounts for 
other users, you can lock their access to your hosting directory by 
indicating which directory the FTP user has access to.)
	
e.	Leave the default Unlimited radio button selected to indicate the 
space limitations in the Quota text field.
 	
	In the future, if you add a new FTP user, you can limit the amount 
of space, in megabytes (MB), by selecting the other radio button 
and typing the numerical amount, such as 50MB, in the text box.
	
f.	Click the Create FTP Account button.
 	
	A new screen loads with a message that the account was created 
successfully; it also displays the settings for this new FTP account.
	
g.	Copy and paste these settings into a text editor, such as Notepad or 
TextMate. 
	
	These settings contain the connection details you need to con-
nect via FTP and looks like this (the FTP username, password, 

80
Part II: Choosing the Right Tools 
and server are specific to your domain and the information you 
entered in the preceding steps):
	
	FTP Username: lisa@yourdomain.com
	
	Password: {W?$s((7Tqi
	
	FTP Server: ftp.yourdomain.com
	
	FTP Server Port: 21 (your web server automatically assigns the FTP 
Port)
	
	Quota: Unlimited MB
	
At any time, you can revisit the FTP Accounts page to delete the FTP 
accounts you’ve created, change the quota, change the password, or find the 
connection details specific to that account.
Transferring Files with an FTP Client
After you create an FTP account on your web server, as described in the pre-
ceding section, you’re ready to connect your FTP client to your web server 
so you can begin transferring files.
Connecting to the web server via FTP
For the purposes of this chapter, I use the Mozilla FileZilla FTP client 
(http://sourceforge.net/projects/filezilla). FileZilla is my favor-
ite FTP client software because it’s easy to use and the cost is free ninety-
nine (that’s open-source geek speak for free!).
My FileZilla client is shown in Figure 5-6; it’s not yet connected to any server. 
On the left of the window is a directory listing of files and folders on my local 
computer. The right side of the window doesn’t display anything . . . yet; it 
will, however, when I connect to my web server.
	
If you use different FTP client software than FileZilla, the steps and look of 
the software differ from what I share with you in this chapter. Adapt your 
steps and practice for the specific FTP client software you use.
Connecting to a web server is a pretty easy process. Before you begin, how-
ever, you need the FTP settings from Step 4 in the preceding section. Then to 
connect to your web server via the FileZilla FTP client, follow these few steps:
	
1.	Launch the FTP client software on your local computer.
	
2.	Choose File➪Site Manager to open the Site Manager, as shown in 
Figure 5-7.

81
 Chapter 5: Exploring Editors, Browsers, and FTP
Figure 5-6: FileZilla FTP client software.
Figure 5-7: The Site Manager in FileZilla.
	
3.	Click the New Site button and name your site.
	
	 You can give the new site a name to help you identify it. This site name 
can be anything you want because it’s not part of the connection data 

82
Part II: Choosing the Right Tools 
that you add in the next steps. (In Figure 5-8, I named mine My Site — 
pretty original, I know.)
	
4.	Enter the FTP server in the Host text field.
	
	 The host name is the same as the FTP server information provided 
to you when you set up the FTP account on your web server. My FTP 
server is mydomain.com (where mydomain.com is your actual domain 
name), so I typed that in the Host text field, as shown in Figure 5-8.
	
5.	Enter the FTP port in the Port text field.
	
	 My port is 21. Typically, in most hosting environments, FTP uses port 21 
and SFTP (secure FTP) uses port 22, and this never changes — just be 
sure to double-check your port number and enter it in the Port text field, 
as shown in Figure 5-8 (check with your web host about which protocol 
you should be using).
	
6.	Choose FTP – File Transfer Protocol from the Protocol drop-down list and 
then choose Normal in the Logon Type drop-down list (see Figure 5-8).
	
7.	Type your username in the User text field and then type your password 
in the Password text field.
	
	 This is the username and password given to you in the FTP settings. For 
example, my username is lisa@yourdomain.com, and my password is 
{W?$s((7Tqi.
Figure 5-8: The FileZilla Site Manager with FTP account information.
	
8.	Click the Connect button.
	
	 Your computer connects to your web server. The directory of folders 
and files from your local computer appears on the left of the FileZilla 
FTP client window, and the directory of folders and files on your web 
server is displayed on the right.

83
 Chapter 5: Exploring Editors, Browsers, and FTP
Now you can take advantage of all the tools and features FTP offers.
Transferring files from point A to point B
After your local computer is connected to your web server, transferring files 
between the two couldn’t be easier. Within the FTP client software, you can 
browse the directories and folders on your local computer on the left and 
browse the directories and folders on your web server on the right.
FTP clients make it easy to transfer files from your computer to your hosting 
account by using a drag-and-drop method. There are two ways of transferring 
files. Here’s what they are and how you use them:
	
✓	Upload: This generally means that you transfer files from your local 
computer to your web server, or upload files. Click the file you want to 
transfer from your local computer and drag and drop it over to the right 
side (the web server side) to upload a file from your computer to your 
web server.
	
✓	Download: This means that you transfer files from you web server to 
your local computer, or download files. Click the file you want to transfer 
from your web server and drag and drop it over to the left side (the local 
computer side) to download a file from your web server to your local 
computer.
	
Downloading files from your web server is an efficient, easy, and smart way 
of backing up files to your local computer. Keeping your files, especially 
theme files and plugins, safe is always a good idea.
Editing files by using FTP
You will run into situations where you need to edit files that live on your 
web server. You can use the methods I describe earlier: Download a file from 
your web server, open it, edit it, save it, and then upload it back to your web 
server. Or, you can use the built-in edit feature that exists in most FTP client 
software by following these steps:
	
1.	Connect your FTP client to your web server and then locate the file 
you want to edit.
	
2.	To use the internal FTP editor, right-click the file and choose View/Edit.
	
	 Remember, for the example, I’m using FileZilla — your FTP client may 
name this command something like Open or Edit. Usually, the FTP client 
uses a program that already exists on your computer, such as Notepad 
(Windows) or TextMate (Mac), to edit the files. Occasionally, depend-
ing on the FTP client software, it may have its own internal text editor. 
FileZilla uses a text-editing program that’s already on your computer.

84
Part II: Choosing the Right Tools 
	
3.	Edit the file to your liking, click the Save icon or choose File➪Save to 
save the changes you made to the file, and re-upload the file to your 
web server.
	
	 After you save the file, a window opens in FileZilla that alerts you that 
the file’s been changed and asks whether you wish to upload the file 
back to the server.
	
4.	Click the Yes button.
	
	 The newly edited file replaces the old one.
That is really all there is to it. Use the FTP edit feature to edit, save, and re-
upload files as you need to.
	
When you edit files using the FTP edit feature, you edit files in a live envi-
ronment, meaning that when you save the changes and re-upload a file, the 
changes take effect immediately and affect your live website. For this reason, 
I always strongly recommend downloading a copy of the original file to your 
local computer before making changes. That way, if you happen to make a 
typo on the saved file and your website goes haywire, you have a copy of the 
original to re-upload quickly to restore it to its original state.
Changing file permissions
Every file and folder that exists on your web server has a set of attributions, 
or permissions, assigned that tells the web server three things about the 
folder or file. On a very simplistic level, these permissions include
	
✓	Read: Determines whether the file/folder is readable by the web server
	
✓	Write: Determines whether the file/folder is writeable by the web server
	
✓	Execute: Determines whether the file/folder is executable by the web 
server
Each set of permissions has a numerical code assigned it, identifying what 
type of permissions are assigned to that file or folder. There are a lot of them, 
but here are the most common ones that you run into and deal with when 
running a WordPress website:
	
✓	644: Files with permissions set to 644 are readable by everyone and 
writeable only by the file/folder owner.
	
✓	755: Files with permissions set to 755 are readable and executable by 
everyone, but only writeable by the file/folder owner.
	
✓	777: Files with permissions set to 777 are readable, writeable, and 
executable by everyone. Don’t use this set of permissions, for security 
reasons, on your web server unless absolutely necessary.

85
 Chapter 5: Exploring Editors, Browsers, and FTP
Typically, folders and files within your web server have already been assigned 
permissions of either 644 or 755. You usually see PHP files with permissions 
set to 644 if the web server is configured to use PHP Safe Mode.
	
I’m giving you a very basic look at file permissions here because you usually 
don’t need to mess with file permissions on your web server. In case you 
need to dig further into this topic, here’s a great reference on file permissions 
from Elated: www.elated.com/articles/understanding-permissions/.
You may run across a situation in which you’re asked to edit and change 
the file permissions on a particular file on your web server. With WordPress 
sites, this usually happens when dealing with plugins or theme files. This 
practice is also referred to as CHMOD, or Change Mode. When someone says, 
“You need to CHMOD that file to 755,” you’ll know what she’s talking about.
Here are some quick and easy steps for using your FTP program to CHMOD a 
file, or edit its permissions on your web server:
	
1.	Connect your FTP client to your web server and then locate the file 
you want to CHMOD.
	
2.	In FileZilla, right-click the file on your web server and choose File 
Permissions to open the file attributes.
	
	 Your FTP client may use different terminology.
	
	 The Change File Attributes dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 5-9.
Figure 5-9: The Change File Attributes dialog box in FileZilla.

86
Part II: Choosing the Right Tools 
	
3.	Type the correct number in the Numeric Value text field.
	
	 This is the number assigned to the permissions you want to give the file. 
Most often, you’re given directions by the plugin or theme developer on 
which permissions number to assign to the file or folder, and typically, 
it’s either 644 or 755. In Figure 5-9, you see the permissions are assigned 
with 755.
	
4.	Click OK.
	
	 The file saves with the new permissions assigned.

Choosing Graphics and  
Software Resources

▶	Optimizing images for use on websites
▶	Browsing image and photo libraries
T
 
hese days, the term designer encompasses many things relating to the 
world of web design. A graphic designer has the ability and creativity to 
create graphics from scratch, or to modify existing photos or graphics to suit 
a particular need using image-editing software. Other web designers don’t 
necessarily create any graphic designs, but they master the art of manipulat-
ing images and photos to display on a website for a nice visual presentation.
This chapter takes a look at some of the popular graphic-editing software 
available (such as Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator and Corel PaintShop 
Pro), as well as some great and inexpensive image and graphic resources to 
add to your toolbox. You also find out the differences among various image 
formats and how to optimize images for a website so pages load faster while 
the images look sharp and clean.
Exploring Image Types and Formats
Graphics software packages don’t come cheap, so before you make a deci-
sion on which one to use, you need to determine what type of graphic work 
you’ll do for your web design projects. Web designers fall into three standard 
categories, and your design style may fall into one, two, or all three:
	
✓	Graphic designer: You may consider yourself an illustrator because you 
create all the graphics that you use from scratch. You start with a blank 
slate, and through different tools and techniques used in your favorite 
image-editing software, you create your own unique graphics.

88
Part II: Choosing the Right Tools 
	
✓	Graphic manipulator: You’re a master at taking graphics, or photos, 
that someone else created and manipulating them for use in your web 
design projects. Through the use of different tools and techniques, you 
can do things like adjust colors and sizes, and even change the shapes 
and positions of the different elements of a graphic (particularly if 
you’re working with vector graphics, covered in the next section).
	
✓	Graphic consumer: You download images from resources on the web 
(check out my list of resources later in this chapter), and you use those 
images to add color and visual design elements to your website projects.
As I state earlier, you may fit one, two, or all three of these categories, and 
that’s perfectly acceptable when designing themes for websites as long as 
you abide by copyright and licensing restrictions on graphics you use (if 
you’re a graphics manipulator and/or consumer). Additionally, it is important 
to understand the types of graphics that you can use to accomplish your 
goals for your web design projects. The following sections cover different 
types of graphics and file formats to help you understand which types of 
graphics you need to use for different purposes.
Comparing raster and vector images
As a graphic designer, you’ll most likely work with two types of graphics —  
raster and vector. As a web designer, you’ll definitely work with raster 
images, and you may work with vector images. The software program that 
you use to edit and create graphics depends on the type of image file you’re 
working with. Here is a brief rundown of the differences between the raster 
and vector images:
	
✓	Raster: These images are made up of hundreds of little dots, or pixels. 
Each pixel can be a different color, allowing for rich, full-color images 
and photographs. Creating and editing a raster image calls for a raster-
based editing program, such as Corel’s PaintShop Pro or Photoshop.
	
✓	Vector: These images are made up of curves rather than pixels. Vector 
images have four vector points, one in each corner of the image, and you 
connect the dots with curves. Then, the curves can be filled with colors 
and effects.
The following sections go into more detail about raster and vector images 
and how you may use them in your web designs.
Raster images
Raster images, such as photographs and graphics used in the website theme 
design, are most often used for web design and display on websites. Raster 
images don’t scale well; if you try to resize the image larger or smaller, you 
see a noticeable loss in the image quality because the pixels get resized and 

89
 Chapter 6: Choosing Graphics and Software Resources
the image becomes grainy. Raster images are flat — there’s only one layer to 
the image elements — making it difficult (and sometimes impossible) to edit 
some of the different image elements within the graphic file. For use on the 
web, however, raster images load quickly because they usually have a small 
file size and don’t require a lot of bandwidth to transfer.
Figure 6-1 shows a raster image file open in Photoshop. On the right side, on 
the Layers tab, there is only one layer — Background — to this raster image. 
Common file formats for raster images include JPG, GIF, and PNG. (I discuss 
file formats for images in the section “Looking at image file formats,” later in 
this chapter.)
Figure 6-1: A raster image in Photoshop.
Vector images
Vector images are used for print design, such as business cards, brochures, 
magazine ads, and billboards. Because vector images are made up of curves 
rather than static pixels, vector images can be resized without any qual-
ity loss. Therefore, you can reduce a vector image to the size of a postage 
stamp or increase its size to fit the side of a large truck, and the image qual-
ity remains the same. That’s why vector images are ideal for logos and print 

90
Part II: Choosing the Right Tools 
work. Typically, vector images are layered — each element of the image has 
its own layer — allowing you to use your favorite vector image editor, such 
as Illustrator, to manipulate and change the different elements within the 
vector image file.
The file sizes of vector images can get quite large, so they’re not ideal for dis-
playing on a website; you’ll want to use raster images instead. However, you 
can start out working with a vector file for your web design work and then 
save the final file in a raster format that’s optimized for the web.
Figure 6-2 displays a vector image file open in Illustrator. On the bottom 
right, on the Layers tab, you see several layers available for editing on this 
particular image. Common file formats for vector images include AI, EPS, and 
CDR. (I discuss these file formats in the next section, “Looking at image file 
formats.”)
Figure 6-2: Vector image file with layers open in Illustrator.
Looking at image file formats
Before I discuss recommended graphic-editing software, you need to under-
stand the types of image file formats you will work with for designing on the 
web. As I mention earlier, the images — whether photos or logos — you save 

91
 Chapter 6: Choosing Graphics and Software Resources
and use on your website should be raster file types because of the smaller 
file size and rich color display. In the following sections, you find out how 
compression affects the size of raster images and discover what types of file 
formats you may use in your own projects.
Understanding compression
When you use raster images in your web design, they need to have a certain 
amount of compression, or a decrease in the overall size of the file. Image 
compression occurs when you save a raster image file as a JPG, GIF, or PNG. 
Compressing a file decreases the size of the image file so that the image loads 
quicker on a web page.
	
The larger the image file size, the longer it takes for that image to load on 
your web page.
Compressing image files can use two different algorithms, depending on the 
file format you’ve chosen for your image file. For digital image files, compres-
sion happens in one of two ways:
	
✓	Lossless compression: All data from the image file is retained during and 
after compression, usually resulting in zero loss of quality from the origi-
nal image file.
	
✓	Lossy compression: This reduces the size of an image file by removing 
certain bits of data from the original file or by combining parts of the 
image that are similar to one another. This usually results in image- 
quality loss from the original file.
Determining which file types to use for your projects
Table 6-1 lists six common file formats you’ll work with for web design and 
the type of file and compression. Although the final image files that you save 
and use in your web design work should be raster, you may begin with vector 
images to edit and manipulate graphics to suit the needs of your web design 
projects.

92
Part II: Choosing the Right Tools 
Here are the three main vector image formats that you’ll probably come 
across in your work with graphic design:
	
✓	AI: Adobe Illustrator, a proprietary file developed by Adobe for repre-
senting vector images
	
✓	EPS: Encapsulated PostScript vector image format
	
✓	CDR: CorelDRAW proprietary graphic file developed by Corel for repre-
senting vector images
When deciding what raster image file format to use in your project, take into 
account the characteristics of each format. In addition to different types of 
compression, the file formats also contain varying amounts of color. The 
characteristics of the three most common raster image file formats include
	
✓	JPG: This format is suited for photographs and smaller images used in 
your web design projects. Although the JPG format compresses with 
lossy compression, you can adjust the amount of compression that 
occurs when you save the file. You can choose a compression level from 
1 to 100, and you usually don’t see a great deal of image quality loss with 
compression levels 1–20.
	
✓	PNG: This format is suited for larger graphics used in web design, such as 
the logo or main header graphic that identifies the brand and the overall, 
visual look of the website. PNG uses lossless image compression and, 
therefore, suffers no data loss during compression, creating a cleaner, 
sharper image. PNG files can also be created and saved on a transparent 
canvas, whereas JPG files can’t. JPG files must have at least a white canvas 
(background), or some other color that you’ve designated.
	
✓	GIF: Compression of a GIF file is lossless, rendering the image exactly as 
you designed it without quality loss. However, GIF files are limited to 256 
colors. For higher-color images, GIF isn’t the greatest format to use; use 
the PNG format instead.
Exploring Graphic Design Software
In the following sections, I introduce you to four software programs that 
designers use to create graphics and edit images, as well as provide you with 
some valuable resources that you can use to figure out the intricacies of the 
software programs presented here.

93
 Chapter 6: Choosing Graphics and Software Resources
	
Graphic design software can get expensive; however, the software packages 
that I mention in this section offer trial versions that allow you to test drive 
the software before you fork out the cash — I recommend the practice of try-
before-you-buy to make sure the software fits your needs.
	
The type of image file or format you’re working with determines which type 
of software you use for that particular image. Raster images require a raster-
based program, and likewise, vector images require a vector-based program. 
(See the earlier section “Comparing raster and vector images.”)
Using raster-based software
The two most common raster-based graphic software programs used by 
designers are Photoshop and PaintShop Pro. Although these programs have 
vector capabilities as well, they aren’t known as vector-editing programs, and 
their vector capabilities are somewhat limited. When you work with raster 
images, you need at least one of these two programs in your arsenal to create 
your designs.
Adobe Creative Cloud
Available from Adobe Systems, which has several graphics programs and 
design software suites, Photoshop is the most popular software for raster 
images, and Illustrator is the most popular software for editing and working 
with vector images. Everything you need is available online via the Creative 
Cloud from Adobe at www.adobe.com/products/creativecloud.html. 
The cost for a new Creative Cloud member is $49.99 per month, but there are 
a variety of other less costly plans that may also suit your needs.
With graphic and web designers using Photoshop, the most popular format 
is a PSD file. A PSD file is a single image file with multiple layers that contain 
complex image effects and text layers that compose a full image. PSD files are 
often used and developed to create full website designs. You can lay out an 
entire design look for a web page in one file, and then using different layers 
and elements, you can create one, flat raster image for use in the overall 
design.
Figure 6-3 displays a PSD file in Photoshop. On the bottom-right side on the 
Layers tab are several layers that compose the file. The PSD file shown in 
Figure 6-3 is a website project I developed for one of my clients. I can open 
a PSD file anytime to change or edit any of the graphics, and then save the 
graphic as a single file in JPG, PNG, or GIF formats to use on the web.

94
Part II: Choosing the Right Tools 
Figure 6-3: A PSD file in Photoshop.
You can add several tools (developed by either Adobe or third-party devel-
opers) to the Photoshop software to help you create effects and elements for 
your graphic design, including
	
✓	Plugins: These small add-on programs created by Adobe, or third-party 
developers, add new features and effects to Photoshop, such as  
the array of Photoshop plugins available from Alien Skin (www. 
alienskin.com).
	
✓	Brushes: These small graphics created by Adobe, or third-party design-
ers, give you some great effects to use with the Paintbrush tool in 
Photoshop.
	
✓	Patterns and textures: These small graphic files created by Adobe, or 
third-party designers, give you interesting textures and pattern effects 
to use in your graphic design.
Photoshop is also well-known for its built-in tools for editing and enhancing 
photographs. Many photographers use Photoshop for this purpose, and as 
a web designer, you can also take advantage of the photo-editing tools in 
Photoshop to enhance and optimize photographs for your website designs.

PaintShop Pro is available for download as a single product ($49.99), or as 
part of the larger Paint Shop Pro X5 Ultimate software suite that bundles 
several digital image, photo-editing, and design products ($59.99). Currently, 
Corel PaintShop Pro is available only for Windows.
Figure 6-4 shows how you can control the amount of compression that’s 
applied to JPG files when saving them in PaintShop Pro. (See the earlier sec-
tion “Understanding compression.”) In the figure, I apply a compression level 
of 10 to the photo that I’m saving. This amount of compression is a good 
trade-off between reducing the file size and retaining much of the original 
image quality. PaintShop Pro allows you to preview the compressed image 
before you save it, so you can decide whether or not you like how much com-
pression you’ve added, and can adjust if needed.
PaintShop Pro makes several add-on tools and utilities available to extend 
the capabilities of the program, enabling you to increase its feature set for 
methods and techniques you can use to create and edit images, including
	
✓	Plugins: These add-on programs developed by Corel or third-party 
developers extend the features of the program. Photoshop has plugins 
as well, and you can use those plugins with PaintShop Pro because 
they’re compatible.

I am asked a lot whether Photoshop or PaintShop Pro is the best for raster-
based image files. I use both for different cases; however, I can say that 
Photoshop is the most popular mainly because it’s available for Windows and 
Mac, whereas PaintShop Pro is available only for Windows. Also, with 
Photoshop, you can create layered PSD files for full website designs, whereas 
with PaintShop Pro, you can’t (but you can edit them, with some limitations). 
Of course, Photoshop is much more expensive, so if price is a big consider-
ation for you, you may want to opt for the more affordable PaintShop Pro.
Using vector-based software
Vector-based editing software lets you create quality vector graphics and 
illustrations that can then be saved in raster format for web use. Many illus-
trators, cartoonists, and logo designers start with vector editing programs to 
create vector images. (See the earlier section “Comparing raster and vector 
images.”)
Two of the most popular vector-based editing programs are Illustrator and 
CorelDRAW. Whether you create vector files from scratch or edit/manipulate 
existing vector files, you need to have a vector-based editing program to take 
full advantage of all the editing tools and features.
	
Vector image files often have several layers containing complex and exten-
sive design elements that add to the overall image. Programs like Photoshop 
or PaintShop Pro (which I describe in the preceding section) don’t allow you 
to expand the layers available in a vector image.
Adobe Illustrator
Illustrator is a vector-image creation and editing program available as part of 
Adobe’s Creative Cloud at http://creative.adobe.com.
With Illustrator, you can open an existing vector file and manipulate it easily 
by discovering the layers embedded in it. Refer to Figure 6-2 to see a simple 
illustration of a logo with multiple layers available for editing in Illustrator’s 
Layers tab (shown in the bottom right). Figure 6-5 shows the same file 
opened in Photoshop; with the Layers tab, the different layers aren’t avail-
able because Photoshop flattens the image. Illustrator leaves the different 
layers intact for editing and manipulation.
The file types that you most commonly work with and come across for 
Illustrator are AI and EPS. These are vector image files that you can easily 
open and edit in Illustrator.
If you’re interested in finding out more about how to use Illustrator for your 
design needs, check out Adobe Creative Suite 6 Design & Web Premium All-in-
One For Dummies by Jennifer Smith, Christopher Smith, and Fred Gerantabee 
(Wiley), or either of the handy online resources in Table 6-4.

CorelDRAW
CorelDRAW is a vector-based editing software available as part of the 
CorelDRAW Graphics Suite X6 ($479; http://corel.com). CorelDRAW is 
currently available only for Windows.
Like Illustrator, CorelDRAW lets you create and edit vector-based images 
by manipulating the available layers embedded within the vector image file.

Within the program, click the layer or curve to select what you need to edit 
and make it active on your editing screen, allowing you to apply different 
effects and edit it to your liking.
You can easily open regular vector image file formats, such as AI and EPS, as 
well as the Corel-specific vector format, CDR. Table 6-5 gives you a few help-

Using Online Image-Optimization Tools
Earlier in this chapter, I recommend four image-editing software programs 
that you, the designer, can use to edit and manipulate images for use in your 
web designs. You can use these image programs to compress your image files 
as much as possible without losing image quality. However, what do you do 
when clients ask how they can compress their images, but don’t have access 
to the same type of software as you? Your clients will use their WordPress 
website to upload photographs and images within their blog posts and pages, 
and you can advise them on a few easy online tools to help them compress 
the images to keep their website load time down as much as possible.
Here are a few nifty, free, online, image optimization tools that you and your 
clients can use:
	
✓	Dynamic Drive: This tool lets you input the web address of the image 
you want to compress, or upload an image from your computer. The 
image optimizer lets you choose what type of image you want to output —  
PNG, GIF, or JPG — or you can choose all three. After this tool gives you 
the optimized, compressed images, you can save them to your local 
computer (usually by right-clicking the images and choosing Save Image 
As) to use on your website later. (http://tools.dynamicdrive.
com/imageoptimizer)

100
Part II: Choosing the Right Tools 
	
✓	Yahoo! Smush.it: This tool lets you upload an image from your com-
puter or enter the URL of the image, and it optimizes and compresses 
the image to make it available for you to download. Smush.it also 
reports on the results of the image compression by telling you, in per-
centages, how much it was able to smush, or compress, your image. 
(http://smushit.com)
	
✓	Image Optimizer: Image Optimizer is another free online service that 
compresses and resizes your images in a downloadable format for you 
to use on your website. It’s also available as an application that you can 
download to your computer so you can use it locally, rather than using 
the Image Optimizer website to compress your images. (www.image 
optimizer.net)
	
✓	Web Resizer: The Web Resizer tool does the same as the previous tools, 
allowing you to upload an image that it compresses and then makes 
available for download to your computer. This tool also provides other 
image-editing tools like resizing, cropping, adding borders, and chang-
ing the tint and contrast of the image. (http://webresizer.com/
resizer)
Finding Online Image Libraries
After you assemble your graphic- and image-editing software tools and under-
stand the types of image files you’re working with, locate some great image 
and photo libraries to add to your web design toolbox.
Frequently, when prospective clients approach you to design their websites, 
they provide some basic requirements, or specifications, they hope you can 
provide for their website designs. These requirements include things like 
color schemes, layout and format, content and features, and images for logos, 
header files, and design elements. If you’re lucky, your clients come to you 
with their image files in hand, ready for you to use. If not, they look to you to 
either create those images or find suitable images from stock photo or stock 
illustration websites. Lucky for you, many are out there — and here are the 
top three that I look to in these situations:
	
✓	iStockphoto: An extensive library of stock photography, vector illustra-
tions, video and audio clips, and Flash media. You can sign up for an 
account and search through its libraries of image files to find the one 
that suits you, or your client, best. The files that you use from iStock-
photo aren’t free — and be absolutely sure that you read the license for 
each image you use. iStockphoto has several licenses, and the cheapest 
one is its Standard license, which has some limitations. For example, 
you can use an illustration from iStockphoto in one website design, but 

101
 Chapter 6: Choosing Graphics and Software Resources
you can’t use that same illustration in a theme design that you intend to 
sell multiple times over (for example, in a premium theme marketplace). 
Be sure to read the fine print. (http://istockphoto.com)
	
✓	Dreamstime: Dreamstime is a major supplier of stock photography 
and digital images. Sign up for an account and search through its huge 
library of digital image offerings. Dreamstime offers free images occa-
sionally — so keep your eyes out for those. Also, Dreamstime has differ-
ent licenses for its image files that you need to pay close attention to. 
One really nice feature is its Royalty Free licensing option, which allows 
you to pay only once for the image and then use it as many times as you 
want; however, you can’t redistribute the image in the same website 
theme over and over again, such as in one template, sold to the public 
multiple times. (http://dreamstime.com)
	
✓	VectorStock: VectorStock offers royalty-free vector-only illustrations 
and graphics for sale. You won’t find stock photography here because 
VectorStock is limited to only vector illustrations. (You need a vector-
based editing program like Illustrator or CorelDRAW to open and use 
these images.) As with other digital-image resources and libraries, 
licenses apply to the images that you purchase and use — be sure to 
read about the license of the image you purchase before using it in your 
web design projects. (www.vectorstock.com)

Choosing Colors and Fonts
In This Chapter
▶	Considering color schemes and palettes
▶	Finding color tools and resources
▶	Understanding font basics
▶	Finding fonts for your project
T
 
wo of the many decisions you’ll make about a website design, whether 
for your site or your client’s, are the color scheme and the fonts that’ll be 
used in and around the site. Sometimes these choices will be easy because 
you, or your client, already have an established color scheme and chosen 
fonts. However, some design projects will require that you make new deci-
sions on color choices and fonts.
Sometimes, making the decision on a color scheme that’s just right can be 
very time-consuming because as a designer, you know that first impressions 
count, and color scheme is an important part of the start of any design pro-
cess. Selecting the right fonts that you want to use is also an important part 
of branding an online identity, so knowing where to find the right fonts and 
tools to help you make the right choices gives you a good head start.
This chapter introduces you to the concepts of color schemes and palettes. 
I share tools and resources you can use to put together a fantastic color 
scheme. I also introduce you to the basic concepts of typography and web-
safe fonts, and help you understand font licensing and where to find fonts 
that you can use in your web designs.
Understanding Color
If I’ve learned something in more than ten years in the web design indus-
try, it’s that people interpret colors differently, and what looks good to me 
doesn’t necessarily look good to you, and vice versa. Many clients have 
asked me to create designs based on a color combination that I’ll always 
remember simply because I thought it was so awful; but my client liked it, so 

104
Part II: Choosing the Right Tools 
I completed the project with the full understanding that I could walk away 
when the project was over and never look at it ever again.
Color and preferences in color combinations are completely subjective and 
based on what looks good to each individual’s eye. Because of this adage, I 
don’t spend time telling you what colors look good and which color combi-
nations work the best because those ideas are mainly based on preference 
and experience. The following sections introduce you to basic color theory 
and terminology to give you a good grasp of the concepts to help guide you 
toward choosing color and schemes with confidence and certainty.
Checking out the color wheel
Almost every graphic design program or web-based color scheme includes a 
red, green, blue (RGB) color wheel (shown in Figure 7-1) that basically sepa-
rates colors into three groups:
	
✓	Primary colors: Includes the three main colors — red, green, and blue
	
✓	Secondary colors: Includes colors that you get when you mix equal 
amounts of primary colors together, such as mixing red and blue to 
create purple
	
✓	Tertiary colors: Includes colors that you get when you mix primary 
colors with secondary colors, such as cyan (blue-green), magenta (red-
purple), or vermillion (red-orange)
Figure 7-1: The standard RGB color wheel.

105
 Chapter 7: Choosing Colors and Fonts
Additionally, you can use the color wheel to discover two main color groups, 
or schemes:
	
✓	Complementary colors: A pair, or group, of colors that exist directly 
opposite one another on the color wheel. Using the color wheel in Figure 
7-1 as the guide, an example would be yellow and blue.
	
✓	Analogous colors: A pair, or group, of colors that are grouped closely 
together on the color wheel. Have a look at the color wheel in Figure 7-1, 
and you find analogous colors like orange and yellow, or red and orange.
You can find an easy-to-use online color wheel at www.colorspire.com/
rgb-color-wheel. To use this wheel, simply click in the color square on 
the left to find complementary or analogous color schemes on the color 
wheel to the right.
Examining the RGB and hex color models
In web design, the two main color models that you’ll deal with on a regular 
basis are the RGB and the hexadecimal (hex) systems, with the hex system 
being the most popular method to define colors in a Cascading Style Sheet 
(CSS). (See Chapter 14 for more on CSS.)
RGB
RGB is a model used to represent the display of colors through electronic 
devices, such as mobile devices and computer monitors. The RGB color 
model is based on the idea that any color can be created by combining differ-
ent levels of red, green, and blue. Because you’re designing for websites that 
are viewed through computer monitors and mobile devices, the RGB color 
model is the standard basis of color in web design.
RGB colors are represented by three numbers, each of which is indicative of 
how much red, green, and blue exist within the specific color. Each color has 
a numerical range of 256 levels of brightness represented by 0–255. You can 
mix and match colors by increasing or decreasing the numbers of each indi-
vidual color until you find the color you like. Based on the 256 values avail-
able for each color, using the 0–255 numbers, here’s what each color equals:
	
✓	Red: R: 255 G: 0 B: 0 (255, 0, 0)
	
✓	Green: R: 0 G: 255 B: 0 (0, 255, 0)
	
✓	Blue: R: 0 G: 0 B: 255 (0, 0, 255)
Luckily, interactive color wheels, such as the one shown in Figure 7-1 and the 
ones you find in your preferred graphics program, make it easy to point and 
click to mix and match colors to find their individual RGB values.

106
Part II: Choosing the Right Tools 
Hex
The most popular way that color is represented in web design is through 
the use of hex codes, or hexadecimals, that represent the colors in the RGB 
model. Two hexadecimal numbers together are a byte and represent up to 
256 different colors. (Remember the RGB model also is based on 256 possible 
color values.) Each of the colors (red, blue, and green) is represented by two 
hexadecimals; those hexadecimals use combinations of 0–9 and A–F.
Table 7-1 lists hex codes for commonly used colors. Actually, when I was a 
kid, I learned a good mnemonic device to help me remember the colors of the 
rainbow — Roy G. Biv (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet). 
Table 7-1 gives you the hex codes for all the colors of the rainbow as well as 
the standard white and black.

Creating Color Schemes with Helpful Tools
You can spend a lot of time creating different color schemes by using the 
online color wheel described earlier; however, you can find other tools to 
help you create just the right color scheme, as described in the following  
sections.

107
 Chapter 7: Choosing Colors and Fonts
Exploring different color combinations
Here are several online tools and places on the web where I find color inspi-
ration and ideas:
	
✓	COLOURlovers: The COLOURlovers website lets you browse through 
millions of different color combinations and palettes that you can use 
in your designs. Figure 7-2 shows the results of the palettes I found by 
searching for an orange color using the hex code #F8981F in the search 
feature. Members of the website submit and share their favorite colors 
and schemes with other members — so it’s a social network based 
around colors. (www.colourlovers.com)
Figure 7-2: Find colors and schemes on the COLOURlovers website.
	
✓	Kuler from Adobe: Adobe’s Kuler is a web-based application where you 
can share and experiment with different color combinations. Kuler is a 
community where members share their color schemes and experiments 
with other members to help inspire one another in the area of color. 
(https://kuler.adobe.com/create/color-wheel/)

108
Part II: Choosing the Right Tools 
	
✓	ColorSchemer Studio 2: ColorSchemer Studio 2 ($49.99) is an applica-
tion for mixing and matching colors to develop a color scheme to use on 
your website design project. Download the app from the ColorSchemer 
website and install it on your computer. From there, use its visual color 
wheel to create your preferred color schemes. This application is avail-
able for Windows and Mac. (www.colorschemer.com)
Finding RGB and hex codes
Sometimes you already have a color scheme defined for you before the 
design project begins; for example, if a client comes to you with her logo and 
wants the color scheme to match it. I’ve also had clients come to me with a 
preferred color scheme based on a favorite photo or just by saying, “I like 
blue and green together” or “I really like the colors used on that website.” In 
these circumstances, pull out the following tools to determine quickly and 
easily the RGB or hex codes of the colors presented:
	
✓	Color Cop: Color Cop is a very handy small application that you down-
load from the Color Cop website (http://colorcop.net) and install 
on your computer (currently available only for Windows). After it’s 
installed, you can find the Color Cop icon on your Windows Quick 
Launch toolbar. Follow these steps to quickly pick a color from a web-
site you’re viewing in your browser:
	
1.	Click the Color Cop icon on your Windows Quick Launch toolbar.
	
	A small Color Cop window opens.
	
2.	Click and drag the eyedropper to your desired color location.
	
	The eyedropper symbol is located on the middle of the left side of 
the window. You can drag the eyedropper to any location on your 
monitor to select your preferred color.
	
3.	Note the RGB and hex codes of your preferred color.
	
	The RGB code appears in the upper-left section of the Color Cop 
window, and the hex code appears in the middle, underneath the 
main color box. Figure 7-3 shows the color red in the Color Cop 
window, which I discovered by dragging the eyedropper over the 
red in the Google logo at www.google.com.
	
4.	When you’re done, close the application by clicking the X button in 
the top-right corner of the window.

109
 Chapter 7: Choosing Colors and Fonts
Figure 7-3: Use the Color Cop eyedropper to find specific colors from a web page.
	
✓	Color Palette Generator: This is an online tool; you can upload an 
image, such as a logo provided by a client or a photograph with a pre-
ferred color scheme, and the website analyzes the image and returns 
a color scheme based on the colors found in the image you uploaded. 
Figure 7-4 shows the Color Palette Generator results after I uploaded 
a photograph of my parrot. You can see that the tool returns the main 
colors found in that image, and from there, I can hover over each color 
with my mouse pointer to discover the specific hex code to use in my 
design project. (http://jrm.cc/color-palette-generator)
	
✓	I Like Your Colors: I Like Your Colors lets you discover a specific color 
scheme of another website by simply entering its URL (web address) 
and clicking the Submit button. I Like Your Colors then returns a listing 
of colors found on the website you entered. This is a handy tool when a 
client comes to you and says, “I love the color scheme on Google — I want 
to use that scheme!” You can then enter Google’s URL and find out the 
exact hex codes for the colors it uses. (http://redalt.com/ilyc)
If all else fails, most graphic design and image-editing programs have color 
pickers, or eyedroppers, that you can use to drag over an image to select a 
particular color. Between your graphics program and the tools and information 
presented in this chapter, you’re all set to create your own color schemes.

Understanding Typography Essentials
Typography refers to the art, design, and visual look of the typeface used in 
print and website design, most likely known as fonts. You see creative uses of 
typography in everything from newspapers and magazines to greeting cards 
and billboards, but you also see it used on websites — both in the content 
body and in graphics and logos.
As a web designer, you use typography styling on your website design proj-
ects in two ways:
	
✓	Body content: These are the fonts, including the size, style, and colors 
you use for the content, such as published articles, pages, posts, and so 
on. The typography styling used in this area is controlled by Cascading 
Style Sheets (CSS) through the use of style definitions. You can find 
more information about CSS, including the font styling and spacing used 
to ensure easy readability and nicer displays, in Chapter 14.
	
✓	Graphics and logos: This refers to the fonts you use to create graphics 
for logos, icons, buttons, and other graphics designed for the website 
project, typically using your preferred design and image-editing soft-
ware, such as Photoshop.

111
 Chapter 7: Choosing Colors and Fonts
In the following sections, you find out more about different font styles and 
discover what fonts are considered web-safe.
Exploring font styles
Fonts come in different shapes and sizes and, for the most part, can be 
grouped into common categories in terms of their style and type:
	
✓	Serif: These fonts have decorative elements, such as tails or curlicues, 
at the edges of letters.
	
✓	Sans-serif: These fonts have straight edges and don’t have decorative 
elements. Generally, sans-serif fonts are considered easier to read on 
computer monitors and mobile devices.
	
✓	Script or decorative: These fonts resemble cursive or handwritten type. 
These are generally not used to display content because they can be dif-
ficult to read at small sizes.
	
✓	Monospace: These fonts have letters that are all the same size and 
width, with no variation. Monospace fonts are typically used to display 
programming code.
Figure 7-5 illustrates these four font styles in a quick graphic I created in 
Photoshop. These categories of font styles are generic styles that reference 
fonts commonly used in web content (see the next section “Discovering web-
safe fonts for content”); however, hundreds of font styles are available to use 
in designing graphics, logos, and other design elements created in your pre-
ferred software. See the section “Finding and Using Fonts for Graphic Design” 
toward the end of this chapter for information on resources you can use to 
find and discover such fonts.
Discovering web-safe fonts for content
The web is actually kind of picky about how it displays fonts and what kind of 
fonts you can use because not all fonts are viewed correctly on the web. The 
concept of web-safe fonts is easy to understand if you keep in mind that for a 
font to appear correctly on a website for any of your readers, the actual font 
used must be a system font on that reader’s computer.

112
Part II: Choosing the Right Tools 
Figure 7-5: Different font styles applied to text in Photoshop.
If a font doesn’t exist on a reader’s computer, the web browser he’s using 
automatically displays the default font set in his web browser options. 
Because of this, you need to know the common fonts that exist within all 
operating systems to ensure each reader views your website the way you 
intended him to. The following minitable illustrates some common fonts that 
are safe to use in your stylesheets and website content areas:

113
 Chapter 7: Choosing Colors and Fonts
You can find additional information on different font families, styles, and 
types in Chapter 14, which covers how to use CSS to define the typography 
styling for your web content.
	
You’re not restricted regarding the type of fonts and font styles you can 
use on web graphics, including logos, header images, buttons, and so on. 
Because those are graphics rather than dynamic content generated by the 
user’s web browser, the fonts you use in graphic design always appear as 
you intend. Web-safe fonts refer only to font families that you include in the 
style definitions in the CSS for the website format. See the “Font replacement 
technology” sidebar to find some resources on how you can replace web-safe 
fonts with your favorite font in your content.
Font replacement technology
With basic CSS practices, you are restricted on 
the types of font families that you can use and 
display in your web design projects. However, 
some really nifty tools that use plugins for 
WordPress allow you to replace standard, web-
safe fonts with fonts of your choosing. Typically, 
the only fonts you’d be able to use are fonts that 
are included in most of the major operating 
systems (such as the fonts listed in the section 
“Discovering web-safe fonts for content”), but 
here are some WordPress plugins you can use 
to replace those fonts with any font you would 
like and make sure it appears correctly in your 
users’ browsers:
	✓	WP-Cufon (http://wordpress.org/
extend/plugins/wp-cufon): This 
plugin for WordPress makes it easy to use 
the Cufon JavaScript tool to convert your 
favorite font files to regular text on your 
WordPress website.
	✓	Typekit Fonts for WordPress (http://
w o r d p r e s s . o r g / e x t e n d /
plugins/typekit-fonts-for-
wordpress): This plugin allows you to 
easily embed fonts from Typekit (http://
typekit.com) on your WordPress web-
site. You can replace some, or all, of the 
fonts that handle text within your content.
	✓	Facelift Image Replacement (FLIR) 
(http://wordpress.org/extend/
plugins/facelift-image-
replacement): This plugin replaces text 
on your WordPress website with an image 
created by your chosen font files, essen-
tially turning your text into images gener-
ated using JavaScript, allowing your text to 
appear using the font of your choice.

114
Part II: Choosing the Right Tools 
The best way to discover the type of font you want to use for the content of 
your website is to try different fonts in your stylesheet to see which one you 
like best. A real handy tool is the Typetester (www.typetester.org). On its 
website, you can insert a paragraph of text and then easily change the font 
styles in the web browser with its tools. As a matter of fact, I added a sen-
tence to the Typetester website and applied different font styling to it, as you 
can see in Figure 7-6.
Figure 7-6: Using Typetester to choose a font for web content.
	
The Typetester website is an especially handy tool if your clients have no 
idea what type of font they want to use. Send them to that website, and then 
tell them to test the various fonts available and report back to you with their 
preferred findings.
Finding and Using Fonts for Graphic Design
As I mention in the preceding section, you’re not limited to the types of fonts 
you can use in graphic design — the sky’s the limit. Literally hundreds of 
thousands, if not millions, of fonts are available on the web. If you’re a fon-
taholic like me, you can get lost in the vast number of font libraries that you 

115
 Chapter 7: Choosing Colors and Fonts
find on the web while searching for just the right font to suit your tastes. I 
can’t tell you how many hours have ticked by while I’ve browsed through and 
admired different font galleries looking for, and usually finding, inspiration.
	
As beautiful and gorgeous as some of the fonts are, they’re not all free for you 
to use. Some of them cost money (in some cases, a great deal of money), and 
many have specific licenses attached to them that designate circumstances 
under which you can use them. Be sure to read the license attached to the 
font, if there is one (usually a file called license.txt bundled in the down-
load file), to be sure you’re fully licensed to use the font in your web project.
Finding the right fonts for your project
Here’s a quick list of free font resources that have some really great fonts 
available for download and use:
	
✓	UrbanFonts.com: www.urbanfonts.com
	
✓	Google Fonts: www.google.com/fonts/
	
✓	daFont.com: www.dafont.com
	
✓	FontFreak.com: www.fontfreak.com
	
✓	Font Squirrel: www.fontsquirrel.com
For your web design projects, you may have to bite the bullet and purchase 
a font or two; or maybe your clients find a font they absolutely must use in 
their design but will have to purchase. Some premium font resources include
	
✓	Fonts.com: http://fonts.com
	
✓	MyFonts: http://myfonts.com
	
One last, but extremely helpful, resource for finding the font you need is 
the WhatTheFont web page (www.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/) on the 
MyFonts site. Use this resource when you have a font but don’t know its 
name or how to locate it. This tool is particularly helpful if a client comes to 
you and says, “I love the font on that site — I want to use the same one.” You 
can either upload an image file that displays the font in question or indicate 
the URL where the font is located. After you do so, WhatTheFont generates 
a listing of possible fonts that match the one you indicated. From there, you 
can purchase the font (if it’s not free) and then download it to your computer 
for use in your web design project.
Installing fonts on your computer
After you find the font that you want to use, install it on your computer so 
it appears in the font list within your preferred graphic design program. On 

116
Part II: Choosing the Right Tools 
the Windows 8 operating system, Microsoft makes it easy to install a font by 
simply double-clicking the font file and then clicking install. Additionally, you 
can select multiple font files and right-click to install in bulk.
Alternatively, you can follow these steps to install a font on the Windows 8 
operating system:
	
1.	Download the font to your computer and save it in a location you’re 
sure to remember.
	
2.	Unzip the download file.
	
	 Typically, font downloads are packaged within a Zip file, requiring that 
you use a popular archiving program, such as WinZip (www.winzip.
com), to unzip (uncompress) the file.
	
3.	Save the unzipped file to a location on your computer and right-click 
the font filename.
	
	Font files have a .ttf (TrueType Font) or .otf (OpenType Font)  
extension.
	
4.	Select Copy.
	
5.	Browse to C:\Windows\Fonts.
	
6.	Right-click inside the C:\Windows\Fonts directory and select Paste.
	
	 This moves the font file from its original location to the Fonts directory 
(C:\Windows\Fonts) on your computer, and a dialog box opens, indi-
cating that the font is being installed. The dialog box closes when the 
font installation is complete.
	
	 The new font is now installed on your computer.

ith every new web design project you begin, you need to answer 
several preliminary questions before you can proceed with starting 
the design and development processes of the website. If you’re working on 
a design project for a client, communicate with her to make sure you under-
stand the requirements before you proceed — same thing if you’re working 
on a project of your own. You have to evaluate the overall project in terms of 
content, type, and purpose to determine what your design strategy will be. 
Without a plan in place from day one, you’re likely to struggle through the 
entire design process, so developing a solid plan first is a good practice for 
every project you approach, no matter how big or small.
In this chapter, I discuss some of those preliminary decisions to make for 
your project, such as which type of layout to use, how many columns to 
include, and what the navigation structure will look like for menus. I also 
explore several ways to present content on a website, such as using full 
content versus excerpts, using photographs versus thumbnails to provide a 
visual component, and presenting content (for example, chronologically, by 
topic, by most popular, and so on). Also in this chapter are concepts and fac-
tors to consider for responsive design, or making sure your site looks good on 
mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets.
Finally, I take you through the steps of creating your own WordPress sand-
box (development environment) locally (on your own computer) so you can 
develop and test your website design before you officially launch it on the 
Internet.

Part II: Choosing the Right Tools 
Choosing the Width of Your Website
Every website starts with a layout that takes width into consideration. Here 
are the primary types of widths to consider when you start to design your 
website:
	
✓	Fixed: This is a static width that’s determined by a set number of pixels. 
This type of layout stays the same size no matter how big or small the 
user’s computer monitor and resolution are.
	
✓	Fluid: This is a flexible width determined by percentages that create an 
experience in which your website fills the entire width of your readers’ 
browsers, no matter how big or small their monitor size and/or screen 
resolution is.
	
✓	Responsive: This type of layout is considered device agnostic. In other 
words, the size of the device the visitor is using to browse the website 
doesn’t matter — the site will display perfectly on very large monitors 
down to the smallest mobile phone device. This layout is called respon-
sive because it responds to the size of the viewing device.
When choosing between fixed, fluid, and responsive layouts, keep in mind 
that computer monitors and resolutions come in several sizes, and people 
who surf the web use their browsers in many ways. Some users fully maxi-
mize their browser windows so that they take up the full height and width of 
the screen. Other users do the same, but use different toolbars and sidebars 
in their browsers that decrease the screen size that displays your website. 
Also in practice are users who use a portrait (vertical) and a landscape 
(horizontal) layout on tablets and mobile devices. Your challenge as a web 
designer is to design your website so that it fits correctly in your visitors’ 
browsers, no matter what their setups are.
Screen resolution, another factor to strongly consider, is a setting on each 
computer system that can vary greatly among your website visitors. Screen 
resolution is the number of pixels wide followed by the number of pixels high 
that a computer monitor uses to display content; the greater the numbers, 
the higher the resolution. So, for example, a resolution of 1600 x 900 (or 1600 
pixels wide by 900 pixels high) is a greater resolution than 800 x 600.
	
W3Schools is a website that leads the way in providing tools and resources 
for web designers; it keeps track of the statistics on what screen resolutions 
are most, and least, used on the web from year to year, and the results are 
then published to help designers understand how people use the Internet. 
The site’s most recent report for 2013 indicates that the majority of people 
who browse the web use a screen resolution greater than 1024 x 768 (www.
w3schools.com/browsers/browsers_display.asp).
The type of layout — fixed or fluid or responsive — that you decide to use 
greatly depends on your own preferences or the preferences of your client. 

119
 Chapter 8: Planning Your Design Strategy
Some designers are completely married to one type of layout over the other; 
however, as computer monitor sizes get bigger and bigger for desktop and 
laptops and then smaller and smaller for mobile devices and tablets, design-
ers are finding that they may have to alter their regular design techniques to 
account for the various screen sizes out there.
In the following sections, I go into more detail about fixed and fluid width and 
responsive layout designs and the pros and cons to each choice.
Designing with a fixed width
A fixed width website has a container that’s a set width, in pixels, and every-
thing within it remains contained within the width defined in the Cascading 
Style Sheet (CSS). (I discuss CSS in detail in Chapter 14.) If a fixed width 
container is set to 960 pixels, for example, it doesn’t move wider than 960 
pixels, no matter what the visitor’s screen size or resolution is. So if a visi-
tor browses at a 1600-pixel-width resolution, the website still displays a 
960-pixel-width container.
Figure 8-1 displays a popular 960-pixel-wide layout. In the figure, the header 
and footer of the site are 960 pixels wide; the content area is 520 pixels wide; 
the two sidebars are 200 pixels wide; and the content area and first sidebar 
are separated by 20-pixel right margins.

The CSS for the layout shown in Figure 8-1 looks something like this:

}
#container {
width: 960px;

 Chapter 8: Planning Your Design Strategy
And the HTML markup for the layout in Figure 8-1 looks like this (and corre-
sponds to the preceding CSS example):
<!doctype html>
<html lang=”en” class=”no-js”>
<head>
<meta charset=”utf-8”>
<title>Your Site Title</title>
</head>
<body>
<div id=”container”>
<header>This is the Site Header</header>
<div class=”content”>
<p>This is the content area</p>
</div>
<div class=”sidebar1”>This is the first sidebar</div>
<div class=”sidebar2”>This is the second sidebar</div>
<div id=”footer”>This is the footer area</div>
</div>
</body>
</html>
	
A 960-pixel-wide layout is the most popular, and most standard, fixed width 
layout because designers create sites with the assumption that 1024 x 768, 
or greater, is the most popular screen resolution in use. So a 960-pixel-wide 
layout appears perfectly on a 1024-pixel-wide resolution when you take 
into account the browser’s toolbar and scroll bars. Anything larger than 
960 pixels creates a horizontal scroll bar along the bottom of the browser 
window, and you don’t want your readers to scroll horizontally while reading 
your website. A resource you may find helpful is the 960 Grid System website 
at http://960.gs, which offers basic Photoshop templates created with a 
960-pixel-wide layout.
Using a fixed width layout has its advantages and disadvantages. One of the 
biggest advantages is that you can more easily control design elements such 
as graphics, icons, and banners. Because a fixed width layout is set to a static 
pixel width, you can be pretty confident that what you see on your computer 
screen is what your website visitors see, too. Because you know the exact 
width of the website, it’s easy to plan for the insertion of videos, photos, and 
other media elements, and you can be certain that the files will display cor-
rectly within the container of the overall site design.
One disadvantage to a fixed width layout is how it looks on larger computer 
monitors. A layout that’s 960 pixels in width shows a lot of empty space on a 
monitor that displays content in a 1600 x 950 resolution. In this case, you’d 
have 640 pixels of empty space. Although this may bother some people, it’s 
not enough to dissuade some designers from using this model.

122
Part II: Choosing the Right Tools 
Figure 8-2 shows my website, which is a fixed layout at 960 pixels in width for 
a 1024-pixel-wide screen resolution. I chose a fixed width layout for my site 
because I find it an easier layout to work with. Figure 8-3 demonstrates how 
the 960-pixel-wide, fixed layout appears in a 1600-pixel-wide screen resolu-
tion. You can see how differently the site appears, in terms of the empty 
space to the left and right of the design container on the 1600-pixel-wide reso-
lution display.

Designing with a fluid width
A website designed with a fluid width layout has a flexible width. The con-
tainer of the website content is determined by percentages rather than static 
pixels. Unlike the fixed width layout, which I discuss in the preceding section, 
the fluid width layout can expand or contract in width based on the screen 
resolution used by the visitor’s browser. In the earlier example for the fixed 
width layout, I used a 960-pixel-wide example; the container of the website is 
exactly 960 pixels in width, and that never changes. With a fluid width layout, 
you change the 960 pixels in width to 90 percent in width. The container 
takes up 90 percent of the browser, no matter how big or small.
Figure 8-4 displays a popular 90-percent-width layout. The header and footer 
of the site are 90-percent wide; the content area is 50-percent wide; the two 
sidebars are 20-percent wide; and the content area and first sidebar are sepa-
rated by 5-percent margins.

The CSS for the layout shown in Figure 8-4 looks something like this:

margin:0;
font-family: arial, verdana, helvetica, sans-serif;
}
#container {
width: 90%;
margin:0 auto;
}
#header {
width: 90%;
height: 100px;
margin-bottom: 20px;
background: #eee;
}
.content {
width:50%;
margin-right: 5%;
float:left;
background: #eee;
}
.sidebar1 {
width: 20%;

125

margin-right: 5%;
float:left;
background: #eee;
}
.sidebar2 {
width: 20%;
float:left;

}
#footer {
float:left;
width: 90%;
height: 100px;
margin-top: 20px;
margin-bottom: 20px;
background: #eee;
}
Combine this fluid width CSS example with the HTML markup I provide in 
the preceding section, and you see the difference in layout. The fluid width 
layout, with the width calculated in percentages, creates an elastic layout 
that changes its width based on the screen size your site visitor uses.
Fluid width has a few advantages — the most important is that it uses all the 
space — or real estate — of a browser. No real estate goes to waste. Fluid 
width adjusts to the visitor’s screen resolution and creates what some feel 
is a better user environment. Also, in screen resolutions smaller than 1024 
pixels in width, it eliminates the horizontal scroll bar across the bottom of 
the browser that often appears with a fixed- width design created for resolu-
tions greater than 1024.
However, fluid width has several disadvantages that you need to be aware of. 
Many of these disadvantages are what cause designers to shy away from a 
fluid-width design. Here are some of these disadvantages:
	
✓	Multimedia display: One major problem accounts for multimedia files 
such as photographs, videos, and images within the content of a web-
site. If, for example, you embed a video that is 500 pixels in width and 
place it within the 50-percent width container (refer to Figure 8-4), you 
can never be sure that every site visitor’s browser creates a content 
area greater than 500 pixels. If the visitor uses a smaller resolution, the 
embedded video, at 500 pixels in width, may overlap other areas of the 
site design, which isn’t your intended result.
	
	You do have workarounds for this problem, however, by using CSS 
properties like min-width and max-width, which I cover in Chapter 
14; however, these properties aren’t supported by Internet Explorer 
(like they are in Firefox and Chrome browsers), which means you have 

126
Part II: Choosing the Right Tools 
to work harder to create Internet Explorer–specific expressions that 
resolve the problem, using the height and overflow CSS properties.
	
✓	Readability: Visitors that have very large monitors or screen resolu-
tion settings may cause a fluid width website to span the entire width of 
the screen, making it sometimes difficult to read — unless you use CSS 
solutions to create a minimum or maximum width, which I discuss in 
Chapter 14.
Speaking of CSS, it’s sometimes difficult to get a fluid width website to appear 
correctly in all major browser systems without a lot of work — and undesired 
browser-specific CSS hacks to force it into working and appearing the way 
it should. Getting the site to appear correctly isn’t impossible, but the extra 
time and work (and brain power) involved in making it happen make some 
designers stick with a fixed- width layout method of designing websites, 
which is a perfectly acceptable practice.
At the end of the day, whichever method of laying out websites you’re most 
comfortable with is what you should stick with. But, by all means, experiment 
with different layouts and solutions to find the ones that you like best.
Designing a responsive layout
A website that has a responsive layout takes the size of any viewing device into 
consideration. It doesn’t matter if it’s the largest television monitor or the small-
est mobile phone or tablet device; the website layout is prepared to handle any 
size on any device. It is called responsive because the layout responds to its 
environment — or in the case of the website, the layout responds to the size 
of the viewing device (monitors, smartphones, tablets, and so on).
The number of devices, platforms, and browser systems available for users 
to view websites grows every day, it seems. Most website owners want to 
make sure they’re paying attention to their mobile and tablet readers, as 
well as their traditional visitors on regular computers. Having a responsive 
layout in place accomplishes this goal and is an important design aspect for 
your website, particularly if a majority of website visitors are using handheld 
devices such as smartphones or tablets.
Refer to Figure 8-2 to see what my personal website looks like on a regular 
computer monitor at a resolution of 1024 x 768, and to Figure 8-3 to see what 
it looks like on an even larger computer monitor with a resolution of 1600 x 
1200. In Figure 8-5, you see an example of responsive design in practice as 
it shows how my personal website looks on an iPhone 5, and in Figure 8-6, 
you see you it looks on an iPad tablet. Responsive layouts are accomplished 
with a mix of grids and layouts that are flexible enough to respond to any 
size viewing environment. As website visitors switch their viewing devices, 
or even flip their view from portrait to landscape, the layout automatically 
switches to accommodate the size — and this includes navigation menus, 
images, media, and content areas.

Part II: Choosing the Right Tools 
You can design a responsive layout a number of different ways, but most 
importantly, you want to make sure that you’re using efficient techniques and 
tools and doing the job the right way. The following list describes some great 
resources to start with for designing responsively — definitely check these 
out and consider them as potential starting points and tools to add to your 
web designer toolkit:
	
✓	Smashing Magazine: “Responsive Web Design: What Is It and How to 
Use It,” an article on responsive design that covers concepts and tech-
niques (http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2011/01/12/
guidelines-for-responsive-web-design/)
	
✓	Bootstrap from Twitter: A front-end framework including HTML, CSS, 
and JavaScript that makes responsive web design faster and easier 
(http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/)
	
✓	Responsinator: A handy web-based tool that allows you to test how 
your website looks on several different mobile devices, including smart-
phones and tablets (www.responsinator.com/)
	
✓	Media Queries: A fantastic site that showcases responsive design tech-
niques in practice today — a great place for inspiration (http:// 
mediaqueri.es/)
If digging into responsive design practices is a little intimidating or some-
thing you’d like to put off for now, WordPress has a handful of plugins that 
will provide mobile layout for any website, regardless of whether it has a 
responsive layout in place. Keep in mind that these plugins will provide you 
with a mobile/tablet view; however, it is not always as customized or visu-
ally appealing as you may want it to be. The only way you have full control 
over how your website looks on any device is by getting into the practice of 
responsive design. Here are a few plugins from WordPress that will provide a 
mobile view for your website:
	
✓	JetPack: A plugin with several different modules, including a Mobile 
module that will give your website viewers the opportunity to browse 
your website on any mobile device or tablet (http://wordpress.
org/plugins/jetpack/)
	
✓	WPTouch: A popular plugin that transforms your WordPress website for 
mobile devices (http://wordpress.org/plugins/wptouch/)
	
✓	WordPress Mobile Pack: A toolkit that provides a mobile view for your 
website and includes different themes, widgets, and a mobile admin 
panel (http://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-mobile-
pack/)

 Chapter 8: Planning Your Design Strategy
Choosing the Number of Columns
Most websites are laid out in columns that span the width of the visitor’s 
computer screen and rows that span the length. When you develop a plan for 
your website design layout, you need to decide how many columns you’ll use 
to display content. The options are literally endless, but keep in mind that 
the more columns you use in a website design, the smaller they need to be 
for them to appear across the width of the screen. (Rows, on the other hand, 
because they are vertical, can be used endlessly because you are not limited 
in the amount of vertical space you have available in your browser window.)
A website that uses a one-column layout has one column that spans the full 
width of the computer monitor, whereas a website that uses a four-column 
layout has four smaller columns that span the width of the screen. Most lay-
outs are anywhere from one to three columns, with each column holding dif-
ferent types of content, such as blog posts, navigation menus, advertisement 
banners, and so on. A two-column layout is the most popular, followed by a 
three-column layout, and in some cases, you do see a one-column layout.
	
Take into account the following factors when deciding how many columns to 
use in a site design:
	
✓	The type of content being presented
	
✓	How much content there is
	
✓	Whether you, or your client, intend to advertise, sell products, or host 
videos or audio files
The answers to those questions help determine how many columns the web-
site needs to cleanly accommodate and present all the different content to 
website visitors. You want the website to have a clean and organized feel, 
as well as to make sure it’s not too cluttered and confusing to visitors. If you 
have a lot of content to display, consider using a larger number of columns to 
present the content in an orderly way.
Figures 8-7, 8-8, and 8-9 show examples of one-, two-, and three-column lay-
outs, respectively. (They are all WordPress-powered websites, by the way!)

Determining Website Navigation
All good websites provide visitors with an easy way to navigate the different 
areas of the sites. To provide your visitors with a way to read internal pages 
and archives and to navigate to a page where they can get in touch with you, 
you have to provide a menu of links, or a navigation menu. A navigation menu 
displays prominently on a website so that your readers don’t have to hunt 
around to find the information they want.
In Chapter 10, I discuss how you can use the built-in Custom Menus feature in 
WordPress to build menus, which makes it easy to include navigation menus 
on your site. Your job as a web designer is to determine what type of naviga-
tional structure makes sense for your client, or your site visitors, and what 
kind of information and links you want to include in those menus. Here are 
the various ways to accomplish your navigational structure:
	
✓	A horizontal navigation menu across the top of your site
	
✓	A vertical navigation menu down one side of your site
	
✓	A series of different menus with groupings of related links
	
✓	A horizontal navigation menu in the footer of your site

132
Part II: Choosing the Right Tools 
The possibilities for providing navigation menus to your visitors are really 
endless, especially with how easy the WordPress platform makes it for you. 
As a designer developing a site, you need to answer these questions:
	
✓	Should you even have a navigation menu? Some sites don’t require a 
full navigation menu, particularly if they’re smaller sites with little con-
tent or information to offer. However, most websites have more than 
one page, and you want to provide a method for your site visitors to 
easily navigate to those pages and back to the home page.
	
✓	Where should you place the navigation menu? A popular location for 
the navigation menu is near the top of the website, below the website 
name and/or header graphic. My website at WebDevStudios (http://
webdevstudios.com) has a theme, as shown in Figure 8-10, that has a 
horizontal navigation menu (with drop-down menus) prominently dis-
played below the site header to make it easy for visitors to navigate to 
the various areas within the site.
Figure 8-10: An example of a horizontal navigation menu with links that drop down, at  
WebDevStudios.com.

133
 Chapter 8: Planning Your Design Strategy
	
✓	What links should you include in the navigation menu? You (or your 
client) should have a good idea of what links and information should be 
presented in the navigation menu. Generally, you include links to impor-
tant internal pages (such as an About Me or Contact page), categories 
or archives, and links to external websites, such as the site’s Twitter or 
Facebook page.
Before writing a single line of code for the website development, knowing 
what the navigation structure should include will help you put a plan in 
place to build and display the navigation menu on the website. For example, 
websites with a great number of links for the menu benefit from a horizon-
tal structure with drop-down lists — links that drop down when you hover 
over the menu titles (shown in Figure 8-10). Likewise, websites with a small 
number of links may benefit from a smaller, more compact vertical menu in 
the sidebar.
Understanding Content Display Options
With a WordPress-powered website, several options are available to display 
content, such as
	
✓	Full articles
	
✓	Excerpts
	
✓	Photo galleries
	
✓	Chronological order
	
✓	Grouped by topic
	
✓	Most popular
Deciding how to display different types of content on your website is greatly 
determined by what type of content your website offers. Here are a few 
examples:
	
✓	An online store: A website that sells products to its visitors wants a 
prominent display of the product information, including photos, descrip-
tions, pricing, and purchasing options. This type of e-commerce setup is 
designed to sell products and make money, so making sure those prod-
ucts and the purpose of the website are prominently displayed when 
a visitor first sees the site is important. See Chapter 16 for a detailed 
explanation of e-commerce options for WordPress.
	
✓	A news or magazine site: This type of site focuses on the delivery  
of content, or articles and stories that have been written for reader 

134
Part II: Choosing the Right Tools 
consumption. This type of site should display the content in a fashion 
that’s easily accessible by readers. You may consider grouping the con-
tent into topical archives with excerpts (short snippets or teasers that 
require the reader to click a Read More link to access the full article) to 
compact the content in areas on the website that are easy to navigate. I 
cover the different WordPress template tags and code for accomplishing 
excerpts and topical archives in Chapter 12.
	
✓	A photography site: A site may focus completely on photography or 
imagery, in which case the emphasis is on the visual offerings of the 
website. Explore options for how to display photos or video galleries in 
Chapter 16.
	
✓	A site with a blog: A simple, typical blog layout, for example, displays 
full blog posts in chronological order (from the most recent posts to the 
oldest). This type of content presentation is typically reserved for a web-
site that has a blog on its front page or a website that contains a blog as 
part of its content offerings. In Chapter 15, I cover using WordPress as a 
content management system (CMS) so that you can use different types 
of layouts for different pages on the website. For example, the front page 
of the website can be all about e-commerce and products, and an inter-
nal page (any page other than your front page) can have a completely 
different layout of blog posts and articles.
You have many options for content delivery with a WordPress website, and 
before you design or code the site, knowing what type of content will be 
presented and how it should look is important information to include in your 
overall plan.
Testing Your Design in a Sandbox Environment
As a website designer and developer, it’s very helpful to have a sandbox to 
play in. A sandbox, in this case, is a website or local development area where 
you can work on a website design and test different layouts and methods of 
content delivery before launching the site live on a client’s (or your) hosted 
domain. As a professional designer who creates several websites per year for 
my clients, a sandbox environment is extremely vital to what I do. The sand-
box allows me a private space to create the site design and present my work 
to my client where we can work, back and forth, to get the site design and 
features in line with what my client expects. After the client gives me final 
approval on the overall website design and layout, I can transfer the site from 
my sandbox domain to the client’s live domain within a matter of minutes. (I 
explain how to accomplish that transfer at the end of this chapter.)

135
 Chapter 8: Planning Your Design Strategy
Additionally, creating a sandbox environment helps me a great deal when I 
work with platforms that change as quickly as WordPress and related plugins 
because I can install and run beta versions of the software (as I discuss in 
Chapter 3). In a test environment, working with new features before they 
release to the public in an official version upgrade can be highly beneficial. 
The advantages of doing this include
	
✓	Becoming adept at using new features so that when you upgrade your 
site, you’re informed enough to advise your users.
	
✓	The opportunity to install and test new plugins or themes before you 
commit to making those changes on your site.
	
✓	Testing early, beta versions of WordPress to help discover bugs and 
then using WordPress Trac to report any problems. You don’t have 
to be a programmer to contribute to the WordPress project. You can 
be a tester and help the developers and programmers fix issues for 
WordPress users worldwide.
In the following sections, you find out how to create your own sandbox envi-
ronment as well as how to transfer a site from your sandbox domain to the 
live domain.
Creating a sandbox environment
You can create a test environment in several ways, and everyone’s mileage 
will vary on how they prefer to create one. Here are the steps you can take to 
create a sandbox environment:
	
1.	Find out whether your hosting provider lets you create subdomains.
	
	 Generally, most hosting providers give you this option. I use the cPanel 
hosting account manager to create my subdomain, but your hosting 
account may offer you a different management tool, such as NetAdmin 
or Plesk.
	
	 A subdomain is the second level of your current domain that can 
handle unique content separately from content in your main domain. 
Subdomains operate underneath your main domain and can function as 
a wholly different section of your site, independent from your existing 
domain name.
	
	 In Steps 3 and 4, I use my domain, ewebscapes.com, to create the sub-
domain http://testing.ewebscapes.com. The prefix testing in 
that web address (or URL) is a subdomain that branches off eweb 
scapes.com that, when set up, handles completely different content 
from what’s currently installed on my main domain.

136
Part II: Choosing the Right Tools 
	
2.	Log in to cPanel (or the hosting account manager tool provided  
to you).
	
	 If you’re using a management tool other than cPanel, the steps will likely 
be different from what I’ve described in this section. Please refer to 
your web-hosting provider’s documentation for assistance with the tool 
you’re using.
	
3.	Locate and then click the Subdomains icon in the cPanel interface.
	
	 The arrangement of icons on the cPanel interface varies from hosting 
provider to hosting provider.
	
	 The Subdomains page within cPanel appears, as shown in Figure 8-11.
Figure 8-11: The Subdomains page in cPanel allows you to create a new subdomain.
	
4.	Type the name of your subdomain in the Subdomain text box.
	
	 For the purposes of making this straightforward and easy, type testing 
in the text box.
	
5.	From the drop-down list, choose the name of the domain on which 
you want to add the subdomain.
	
	 In Figure 8-11, the drop-down list shows the domain ewebscapes.com. 
In this example, you’re creating the subdomain on this domain, so the 
new subdomain is http://testing.ewebscapes.com.

137
 Chapter 8: Planning Your Design Strategy
	
	 A unique folder name for your new subdomain appears in the Document 
Root text box. Don’t alter this text because this tells your web server 
where to install the necessary WordPress files.
	
6.	Click the Create button.
	
	 After a few seconds, the page refreshes and displays a message that the 
new subdomain has been created, as shown in Figure 8-12.
Figure 8-12: A successful subdomain-creation message in cPanel.
Now that you have a subdomain set up on your hosting account, you can 
install WordPress into the folder that was created when you added the sub-
domain. For example, if you created a testing subdomain, you’ll install 
WordPress into the /testing folder. Flip to Chapter 3 for the steps to install 
WordPress.
With your new subdomain created, you can work on your new WordPress 
website design and development without disrupting anything on the live  
site (or the intended domain where the website will eventually be after it’s 
completed).
	
To go one step further, you can use the Members Only WordPress plugin to 
lock down your sandbox environment and keep it away from prying eyes and 
search engines. The Members Only plugin lets you show the website to only 
those people whom you give access to by providing them with a username 
and password to log in to the sandbox test site. You can find the Members 
Only plugin on the Plugin Directory page at http://wordpress.org/
extend/plugins/members-only. (See Chapter 16 for the lowdown on 
installing plugins.)
Using a plugin to back up and  
transfer from your sandbox
I use the BackupBuddy plugin on a regular basis to move a WordPress web-
site from one hosting environment to another. BackupBuddy is not a free 
plugin available on the WordPress Plugin Directory page. You have to pay for 

138
Part II: Choosing the Right Tools 
this plugin, but it’s worth every penny because it takes the entire backup and 
migration (or transfer) process and makes mincemeat out of it. Translation: 
BackupBuddy makes the backup and migration of your website very easy, 
and can be done in minutes.
You can use the BackupBuddy plugin to back up and transfer from your sand-
box environment to your client’s destination server and vice versa. Follow 
these steps to use this plugin to move the website from your sandbox envi-
ronment to your or your client’s server:
	
1.	Purchase and download the BackupBuddy plugin from http://
ithemes.com/purchase/backupbuddy.
	
	 At this time, the cost for the plugin starts at $80.
	
2.	Install the plugin on your current WordPress website.
	
	 By current, I mean your sandbox environment, not the destination  
server yet.
	
3.	In WordPress Dashboard, choose Plugins➪BackupBuddy➪Activate 
under the BackupBuddy plugin name.
	
	 WordPress activates the plugin.
	
4.	Choose BackupBuddy➪Backups.
	
	 The Backups page appears.
	
5.	Click the Full Backup button.
	
	 This initiates a full backup of your database, files, and content and then 
packages it neatly into one Zip file for you to store on your local com-
puter, in a location of your choosing.
	
6.	Download the importbuddy.php file by clicking the importbuddy.
php link on the Backups page and downloading it to your local  
computer.
	
	 Preferably, place this file in the same directory as the backup file you 
downloaded in Step 5.
	
7.	Connect to the destination web server via FTP.
	
	 See Chapter 5 for the lowdown on connecting to your web server and 
transferring files with FTP.
	
8.	Upload the backup.zip file and the importbuddy.php file.
	
	 These files are uploaded in the root, or top-level, directory on your web 
server. On some web servers, this is the /public_html folder, but on 
others, it may be the /httpdocs folder. If you aren’t sure what your 
root directory is, your hosting provider can tell you.

139
 Chapter 8: Planning Your Design Strategy
	
9.	Create a new database on your new hosting account.
	
	 You can find the steps for creating a database in Chapter 3.
	
10.	Navigate to the importbuddy.php file in your web browser.
	
	 This URL looks like http://yourdomain.com/importbuddy.php 
(where yourdomain.com is your actual domain name).
	
	 The BackupBuddy page loads in your web browser.
	
11.	Follow the steps provided on the BackupBuddy page to import the 
backup file and install WordPress.
	
	 These steps include adding the database information needed, such 
as the database username, database name, password, and host (see 
Chapter 3).
	
	 This entire process takes about 5–10 minutes, maybe more depending 
on the size of your website.
	
12.	Type the URL of your website in your web browser address bar and 
press Enter.
	
	 This loads your website in your browser window, and after BackupBuddy  
does its thing, the new website is completely loaded onto the new 
server and is an absolute duplicate of what you have in your sandbox 
environment.
Using this method to back up and transfer a full WordPress website from one 
server to another takes about 5–10 minutes, which is a huge time-saver. If 
you had to transfer and back up the site manually (by taking manual backups 
of separate elements, such as images, content, themes, plugins, settings, and 
so on), it’d take a couple hours to complete. The BackupBuddy plugin is an 
essential tool in my WordPress toolkit that I use several times per week, at 
least.

Finding and Installing a  
WordPress Theme
In This Chapter
▶	Finding, previewing, downloading, and installing themes
▶	Deciding whether to use premium themes
W
 
ordPress themes are simply a group of files, called templates, bun-
dled together that, when activated in WordPress, determine the look 
and basic function of your site. WordPress comes packaged with one very 
useful default theme — Twenty Thirteen (named after the year it was released 
in version 3.5 of WordPress). Most bloggers who use WordPress usually don’t 
waste any time finding a theme that they like better than Twenty Thirteen. 
Although you’re not limited to the default theme, it’s very functional for a 
basic site. (See Chapter 10 for more on the Twenty Thirteen theme.)
This chapter discusses other WordPress themes that you can download and 
use as a foundation for your overall design work. Not all WordPress themes 
are created equal, and it’s important for you to know the differences between 
free and premium themes:
	
✓	Free: These themes are free, period. You can download and use them on 
your website at absolutely no cost. As a courtesy, you can include a link 
to the designer in your footer — but you can even remove that link if 
you want to.
	
✓	Premium: These themes cost money. You usually find premium themes 
available for download only after you pay anywhere from $10 to $500. 
The designer feels that these themes are a cut above the rest and, there-
fore, are worth the money you spend for them. Most premium themes 
come with a full support package and access to future upgrades of the 
theme as they’re released.
In this chapter, you discover how to find, install, and activate free themes on 
your site. Additionally, I introduce premium themes.

144
Part III: Working with WordPress Themes 
	
You can also create your own theme from scratch, as I cover in Chapters 11 
and 12, but sometimes using an existing theme keeps you from completely 
reinventing the wheel because the framework is already done.
Finding and Installing a Theme  
from the Themes Directory
Free WordPress themes are popular because of their appealing designs, easy 
installation and use, and mostly their price tag — free. They’re great tools to 
use when you launch your new site, and if you dabble a bit in graphic design 
and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), you can customize one to fit your needs. 
(See Chapter 14 for HTML resources and CSS information.)
By using free themes, you can have your site up and running with a new 
design — without the help of a professional — pretty fast. You can change 
your theme as often as you want. Trying several free themes is like trying on 
different outfits for your site; you can change outfits until you find just the 
right theme. Finding the theme that fits you best may take some time, but 
with thousands available, you’ll eventually find one that suits you.
The WordPress platform gives an easy way to browse the Themes Directory 
page to find, preview, and install themes on your site without ever leaving the 
comfort of the WordPress Dashboard. The following steps show you how:
	
1.	Choose Appearance➪Themes on the WordPress Dashboard and then 
click the Install Themes tab at the top of the Manage Themes page.
	
	 The Install Themes page opens, as shown in Figure 9-1.
	
2.	Search for a new theme by entering a keyword, author, or tag in the 
Search box. You can filter the results by using the Feature Filter check 
boxes to filter theme results by colors, columns, width, features, and 
subjects.
	
3.	After you’ve entered your search criteria, click the Search button to 
the right of the Search box.
	
	 The search results page displays a list of themes for you to choose from.
	
4.	(Optional) Click the Preview link underneath the theme of your 
choice to view a sample of how the theme looks. To return to the 
search results page, click the Close link in the upper-left corner of the 
preview window.
	
	 Figure 9-2 shows a preview of the Path theme, which I found by search-
ing for the keyword Responsive on the Install Themes page.
	
5.	After you find a theme you like, click the Install link underneath the 
theme name to install the theme on your site.

146
Part III: Working with WordPress Themes 
	
6.	Click the Install New button to complete the installation.
	
	 The window closes, and the Installing Theme page appears.
	
7.	Click Activate to activate and display the new theme on your site.
	
	 The Manage Themes page refreshes and displays the activated theme 
under the Current Theme header, indicating that it’s the theme currently 
in use on your website.
	
Themes found in the official WordPress Themes Directory have been vetted by 
the WordPress folks. Your Dashboard hooks into the Themes Directory page 
on the WordPress.org website (http://wordpress.org/extend/themes), 
so you find only those themes that are free and safe. Safe themes are free of 
spam and malicious code and contain basic WordPress functions to ensure 
that your WordPress site functions with the minimum requirements.
Deciding to Use a Premium Theme
Premium WordPress themes have become a very popular way for talented 
designers to provide a service they’re passionate about — designing  
themes — while making a little money for their efforts. There are many 
schools of thought as to what makes a theme premium. Actually, the topic 
of what is and isn’t considered premium is guaranteed to spark passionate 
debate among designers and theme users. However, almost everyone agrees 
the following are indicators of premium themes:
	
✓	Very high-quality graphic design (beautiful, professional graphics) and 
CSS development.
	
✓	A theme structure with functions that make it easier for you to custom-
ize and adjust the theme to suit your needs. This includes, but isn’t 
limited to, altering the header graphic/logo and color scheme as well as 
changing images and icons.
	
✓	Comprehensive documentation that provides the user with extensive 
instructions on how to use the theme. This is especially useful if the 
theme has multiple features and customization options.
	
✓	Full support by the designer who created the theme. Typically, when 
you buy a premium theme, you get full support for that theme for as 
long as you use it.
	
✓	Fee for use. Premium themes cost money. Prices on premium themes 
range from $10 to $500.
	
This isn’t to say that some free themes don’t have some, or all, the features I 
just listed — it’s just that, for the most part, they don’t.

Working with the Default Theme: 
Twenty Thirteen
In This Chapter

▶	Tweaking your header image
▶	Installing custom navigation menus
▶	Exploring widgets on your website
B
 
undled with every WordPress installation is the default Twenty 
Thirteen theme, named for the year it was released to the public. 
Twenty Thirteen was created by the core WordPress team. It’s a starter 
theme that gets new users up and running with their websites and lets them 
apply a clean-looking theme that utilizes many of the built-in display fea-
tures standard to a basic WordPress install. These display features include 
the ability to use different header images (such as your own custom header 
graphics) and build custom navigation menus easily with the Custom Menus 
feature.
By working with the Twenty Thirteen theme, you gain an understanding of 
the features WordPress users are accustomed to seeing in themes. If you plan 
to create your own WordPress themes, you can find out a lot by exploring 
these common features so you can implement them in your own themes. The 
information provided in this chapter can be carried over into other themes, 
as well.
In this chapter, I introduce you to the Twenty Thirteen theme’s built-in fea-
tures, such as different layouts, headers, menus, and widgets.
Exploring the Layout and Structure
The Twenty Thirteen theme, shown in Figure 10-1, offers a clean design style 
that’s highly customizable for the millions of WordPress users who want a 

148
Part III: Working with WordPress Themes 
simple but modern look that focuses on the content for their sites. As such, 
the font is sharp and easy to read. Many of the new built-in theme features 
allow you to make simple yet elegant tweaks to the theme, including upload-
ing new feature images and adjusting the background colors.
Figure 10-1: The Twenty Thirteen theme.
In Chapter 8, you find out how to plan a web design project that includes 
choosing how many columns you want to use for your design layout. The 
default Twenty Thirteen theme gives you two layout choices by using widget 
areas that come with it:
	
✓	One-column default layout: The one-column layout — a popular layout 
trend for websites and blogs — is the default view for the Twenty 
Thirteen theme, and it includes the header area (for the site name and 
menu navigation), a content area in the center of the site, and a widget-
ready footer at the bottom of the site. (Refer to Figure 10-1.)

149
 Chapter 10: Working with the Default Theme: Twenty Thirteen
	
✓	Two-column page layout: The two-column layout, shown in Figure 10-2, 
is the more common layout that you may already be used to for web-
sites and blogs. It provides all the layout options for the one-column 
(header, content, and footer) layout and adds a right sidebar that you 
can add widgets to.
Figure 10-2: A two-column layout.
To apply Twenty Thirteen’s two-column layout to a new WordPress page, 
simply add a widget or two (or more!) to the Secondary Widget area in the 
Widgets page in your Dashboard; see the “Enhancing your Website with 
Widgets” section for reference on how to use widgets.
	
The Twenty Thirteen theme has two widget areas: Main Widget Area and 
Secondary Widget Area. The widgets you add to the Main Widget Area appear 
in the footer area of your website, and the widgets you add to the Secondary 
Widget Area appear in the right sidebar of your site. Chapter 12 gives you 
lots more information on using the different widgets available in WordPress.

150
Part III: Working with WordPress Themes 
Customizing the Header Image
Most themes have a header image that appears at the top of the website. This 
image is generated by a graphic defined in the Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) 
value for the property that represents the header area or through the use of 
a custom header feature in WordPress. In the Twenty Thirteen theme, all the 
hard work’s done for you, so including a custom header image on a site that 
uses that theme is pretty easy.
With the custom header feature that the Twenty Thirteen theme supports, 
you can choose one of three header images to display on your website, or 
you have the option to upload one of your own images. (For details on defin-
ing a background image for the header image using CSS, see Chapter 14.)
Selecting one of the available header images
To use one of the available header images on your site, follow these steps:
	
1.	On the WordPress Dashboard, choose Appearance➪Header.
	
	 The Custom Header page appears in your browser window. Notice in the 
Preview section that one of the header images is selected by default and 
is already displayed on your website, as shown earlier in Figure 10-1.
	
2.	Scroll to the Default Images section, which shows the available header 
images, and select the header image you like.
	
	 Figure 10-3 shows the three available header images. The first one is 
already selected by default. You can also select the random option to 
have a different header image appear with each page view.
	
3.	Click the Save Changes button at the bottom of the page.
	
	 The Custom Header page refreshes and displays your chosen header 
image in the Preview section.
	
You can easily switch between the different header images by revisiting the 
Custom Header page and applying one of the other header images on your 
site by following the preceding steps.

151
 Chapter 10: Working with the Default Theme: Twenty Thirteen
Figure 10-3: The Custom Header page shows the Twenty Thirteen theme’s three default header  
images.
Uploading your own header image
Although the default header images are acceptable, you may want something 
unique for your site. You can choose a custom header image, such as a pho-
tograph you’ve taken or an image you’ve designed. (See Chapter 6 for the 
lowdown on different image types and formats.)
Follow these few steps to upload your own header image to your website:
	
1.	On the WordPress Dashboard, choose Appearance➪Header.
	
	 The Custom Header page loads in your browser window (refer to  
Figure 10-3).
	
2.	Scroll to the Select Image section, shown in Figure 10-4, and click the 
Browse button.
	
	 A dialog box pops up asking you to select an image from your comput-
er’s hard drive.

152
Part III: Working with WordPress Themes 
Figure 10-4: The Twenty Thirteen Select Image section.
	
3.	Select the image you want to use from your local computer, click the 
Open button, and then click the Upload button.
	
	 Your chosen image uploads to your web server, and the Crop Header 
Image page loads in your browser.
	
4.	(Optional) Use the image crop tool on the Crop Header Image page to 
resize your header image.
	
	 The Twenty Thirteen theme’s default header size is 1600 x 230 pixels. 
Generally, it’s best to upload a new header image already cropped in 
an image-editing program to that exact size. However, if your image is 
larger, you can use the built-in image crop tool to fit the image in the 
default space after you upload the header, as shown in Figure 10-5.

153
 Chapter 10: Working with the Default Theme: Twenty Thirteen
	
	To resize and crop your larger image, simply drag one of the eight small 
handles located at the corners and in the middle of each side of the 
image, as shown in Figure 10-5. You can also click within the image and 
move the entire image up or down to get the optimal placement and 
cropping effect you want.

5.	Click the Crop and Publish button.
	
	 The Custom Header page loads on the Dashboard and displays your new 
header image.
	
6.	Click the Save Changes button.
	
	 The changes you’ve made are saved to the header image, and it pub-
lishes to your site.
	
Figure 10-6 displays the new header image I uploaded and added to my site 
using the Custom Header feature available in the Twenty Thirteen theme. 
Compare that with the display of my site shown earlier in Figure 10-1 and you 
can see that the header image has changed, making the website unique to me!

Part III: Working with WordPress Themes 
Figure 10-6: Displaying a unique header image.
Including Custom Navigation Menus
A navigation menu lists the links displayed on your site. These links can 
take you to pages, posts, or categories within your site, or to other sites. 
No matter what they link to, you can define navigation menus on your site 
through the built-in menus feature in WordPress.
I suggest you provide at least one navigation menu on your site so that read-
ers can see everything your site has to offer. Providing visitors with a link — 
or several — to click is in keeping with the point-and-click spirit of the web.
Much like the drag-and-drop widgets feature (which I cover later in this chap-
ter) that enables you to tweak areas of your site without knowing hardly any 
code, the menus feature offers an easy way to add and reorder a variety of 
navigational links to your site as well as create secondary menu bars (if your 
theme offers multiple menu areas).
	
The menus feature is already built in to the default Twenty Thirteen 
WordPress theme, so you don’t have to worry about preparing your theme 
for it. Not all themes have this feature available though, because you have to 
add support for it in the theme functions file. I discuss how to enable this fea-
ture by using a functions file in Chapter 12.

155
 Chapter 10: Working with the Default Theme: Twenty Thirteen
To create a new navigation menu in Twenty Thirteen, follow these steps:
	
1.	Choose Appearance➪Menus on your Dashboard.
	
	 The Menus page opens on your WordPress Dashboard.
	
2.	Type a name in the Menu Name box and click the Create Menu button.
	
	 The Menus page reloads with a message that your new menu has been 
created. I named my menu Main, as shown in Figure 10-7.
Click to expand module.
New menu items added
Figure 10-7: The Menus page on the Dashboard.
	
3.	Add new links to your newly created menu. WordPress allows you to 
add new links to the menu in three ways, as shown in Figure 10-7:
	
•	Pages: Click the View All link to display a list of all the pages you 
have currently published on your site. Select the check box next to 
the page names you want to add to your menu and then click the 
Add to Menu button.
	
•	Links: Expand the Links module by clicking the arrow on the right, 
and then in the URL field, type the URL of the website that you 
want to add (for example, type http://www.google.com). Then 
type the name of the link that you want to display in your menu 
in the Text field (in this case, type Google). Then click the Add to 
Menu button.

156
Part III: Working with WordPress Themes 
	
•	Categories: Expand the Categories module by clicking the arrow on 
the right, and then click the View All link to display a list of all the 
categories you’ve created on your site. Select the check box next 
to the category names you want to add to the menu and then click 
the Add to Menu button.
	
4.	Review your menu choices on the right side of the page.
	
	 When you add new menu items, the column on the right side of the 
Menus page populates with your menu choices. In Figure 10-7, I popu-
lated my menu with one link, one page, and one category (Home, About, 
and Books, respectively).
	
5.	(Optional) Edit your menu choices by clicking the down arrow to the 
right of the menu item name.
	
6.	When you’re satisfied with your menu choices, click the Save Menu 
button on the top-right of the Menus page.
	
	 A message confirming that the new menu has been saved appears.
	
You can create as many menus as you need for your website. Although the 
main navigation menu (which is determined in Appearance➪Menus➪Manage 
Locations➪Navigation Menu) appears below the header image on the Twenty 
Thirteen theme (refer to Figure 10-1), menu widgets are available that allow 
you to display other menus you’ve created in different areas of your website, 
such as the sidebar or footer. (I cover widgets in the next section.)
After you save your navigation menu, you can customize it in the following ways:
	
✓	Rearrange menu items: Use the drag-and-drop interface on the Menus 
page to rearrange your menu items by clicking a menu item with your 
mouse, dragging it to the desired location, and then releasing your 
mouse to finalize its position (see Figure 10-8).
Figure 10-8: Dragging the About menu link to the top of the menu.
	
✓	Create subpages under top-level menu items: To create a subpage, 
move a menu item slightly to the right and below the top-level item, as

Enhancing Your Website with Widgets
WordPress widgets are very helpful tools built in to WordPress. They enable 
you to easily arrange how your content — such as your blogroll, recent 
posts, and monthly and category archive lists — appears in your website 
sidebar. With widgets, you can arrange and display the content in the sidebar 
without knowing PHP or HTML.
In the following sections, I introduce you to widgets, explain how to add one 
to your site, and describe in detail two popular widgets — the Text widget 
and the Recent Posts widget.
Understanding how widgets work
Widget areas are the editable regions defined in your theme that enable you 
to insert or arrange content, such as a list of your recent blog posts, links to 
your favorite sites, or new custom menus, by simply dragging and dropping 
(and editing) available widgets on the Dashboard’s Widgets page into those 
corresponding areas.
Many of the available widgets offered by WordPress (and those added some-
times by WordPress themes and plugins) provide drag-and-drop ease of 
installation of more advanced functions that would typically be available only 
if you wrote code directly into your theme files.
To view the widgets available for use on your website, choose Appearance➪ 
Widgets from the Dashboard. The Widgets page appears, displaying the avail-
able widgets on the left side of the page, as shown in Figure 10-11. This page 
enables you to control what features you use and where you place them — 
all without knowing a lick of code.
By default, the footer and sidebar in the Twenty Thirteen theme are widget-
ized, meaning the footer and sidebar areas expand to show any content you 
add to any of the two widget-ready areas. Figure 10-11 shows the widget 
areas displayed on the Widgets page on your Dashboard.
When you activate the Twenty Thirteen theme, the Widgets page on your 
Dashboard shows two widget areas:
	
✓	Main Widget Area
	
✓	Secondary Widget Area

Figure 10-11: The Widgets page lists available widgets.
With the Twenty Thirteen theme activated on your site, the first widget area, 
Main Widget Area, displays widgets on your website in the footer area, as 
shown in Figure 10-12. The Secondary Widget Area displays widgets in the 
right sidebar of your website.
	
The number and appearance of widgets will vary depending on the theme 
you’re currently using on your website. The Twenty Thirteen theme has two 
widget areas, but another theme may have more, to accommodate more con-
tent areas on your site.

Footer widget area
Figure 10-12: The Twenty Thirteen theme’s footer widget area.
Adding widgets to your sidebar or footer
The left side of the Widgets page lists all the available widgets for your 
WordPress site (refer to Figure 10-11). The right side of the page lists the 
widget areas designated in your theme. Drag your selected widget from the 
left side of the page into your chosen widget area on the right. For example, 
to add a search box to the right sidebar of the default layout of the Twenty 
Thirteen theme, drag the Search widget from the Available Widgets section to 
the Secondary Widget Area.
To add a new widget to your sidebar or footer, follow these steps:
	
1.	Choose Appearance➪Widgets from the Dashboard.
	
	 The Widgets page appears (refer to Figure 10-11).
	
2.	Decide which widget you want to use from the Available Widgets  
section.
	
	 For the purpose of these steps, I chose the Recent Posts widget.

161
 Chapter 10: Working with the Default Theme: Twenty Thirteen
	
3.	Click the widget title and then drag and drop the widget into the Main 
Widget Area or Secondary Widget Area on the right side of the page.
	
	 I dragged the Recent Posts widget to the Secondary Widget Area.
	
4.	Configure options for the widget as desired and then click Save.
	
	 Each widget has different options that you can configure. Some widgets 
have a number of editable options; others simply let you write a title for 
the widget area. As shown in Figure 10-13, the Recent Posts widget has 
two options: one for editing the title of the widget and one to determine 
how many recent posts to display. Open the widget, by clicking the 
arrow to the right of the widget title, to explore the options available.
Recent Posts widget

	 I discuss the options for the Text widget and RSS widget in more detail 
in the next two sections.
	
5.	(Optional) Repeat Steps 1 through 4 to add more widgets to your 
layout.

162
Part III: Working with WordPress Themes 
	
6.	Arrange your widgets in the order you want them to appear on your 
site by clicking a widget and dragging it above or below another 
widget. Repeat this step until your widgets are arranged the way you 
want them.
After you select and configure all your widgets, visit your website in your 
web browser and you can see that your site’s sidebar matches the con-
tent (in the proper order) you’ve arranged in the Main Widget Area and 
Secondary Widget Area on the Widgets page on your Dashboard. How cool 
is that? You can go back to the Widgets page and rearrange, add, or remove 
items to your heart’s content.
	
To remove a widget from your sidebar or footer, open the widget title’s 
drop-down list and then click the Delete link. WordPress removes the 
widget from the widget area on the right side of this page and places it back 
in the Available Widgets section. If you want to remove a widget but want 
WordPress to remember the settings that you configured for it, instead of 
clicking the Delete link, simply drag the widget into the Inactive Widgets sec-
tion on the left side, near the bottom of the page. This stores the widget, with 
all its settings, for future use.
Using the Text widget
The Text widget is one of the most useful WordPress widgets because it 
enables you to add text and HTML code into widget areas without editing 
the theme’s template files. For that reason, the Text widget is the jack-of-all-
trades widget; it enables you to include several types of information on your 
site by including your own text within it.
To illustrate this, here are some diverse examples for how I’ve used the Text 
widget and why it’s such a popular feature:
	
✓	Add an e-mail newsletter subscription form: You can add a form that 
allows your site visitors to sign up for your e-mail newsletter. This often 
involves HTML, so the Text widget is especially helpful because it allows 
you to include basic HTML markup within it.
	
✓	Display business hours of operation: You can display the days and 
hours of your business operation where everyone can easily see them.
	
✓	Post your updates from social networks: Many social networking sites 
like Twitter and Facebook offer embed codes to display your updates 
on those sites directly on your website. They often include JavaScript, 
HTML, and CSS, and with the Text widget, you can easily embed the 
code provided.
	
✓	Announce special events and notices: If your organization has a spe-
cial sale, an announcement about a new staff member, or an important 
notice about inclement weather closings, you can use the Text widget to 
quickly post these types of things in just a few seconds to your site.

163
 Chapter 10: Working with the Default Theme: Twenty Thirteen
	
The WordPress Text widget does not allow you to include PHP code of any 
kind, such as special WordPress template tags or functions like the ones you 
find in Chapter 12. However, a great plugin — the Advanced Text Widget — 
allows you to insert PHP code within it. If you need this feature, you can 
download the Advanced Text Widget from the WordPress Plugin Directory 
page at http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/advanced-text-
widget. (I discuss how to install plugins in Chapter 16.)
To add the Text widget to a sidebar or footer on your site, follow these steps:
	
1.	From the WordPress Dashboard, choose Appearance➪Widgets.
	
2.	Drag and drop the Text widget from the Available Widgets section to 
the desired widget area on the right. (See the preceding section for 
instructions on how to do this.)
	
	 The Text widget opens automatically to allow for editing.
	
3.	Add a widget title in the Title field and any desired text in the text 
area, as shown in Figure 10-14.
Text widget
Figure 10-14: The Text widget.

164
Part III: Working with WordPress Themes 
	
4.	Click the Save button and then click the Close link.
	
	 The text widget closes, and you can view the content of the widget on 
your website.
Adding the RSS widget
The RSS widget allows you to pull headlines from almost any RSS (really 
simple syndication) feed, including recent headlines from your other 
WordPress blogs or sites, and headlines from news sites or other sources 
that offer RSS feeds. This is commonly referred to as aggregation, gathering 
information from a syndicated RSS-feed source to display on your site.
Follow these steps to add the RSS widget to your site:
	
1.	From the WordPress Dashboard, choose Appearance➪Widgets.
	
2.	Drag and drop the RSS widget from the Available Widgets section to 
the desired widget area on the right.
	
	 See the section “Adding widgets to your sidebar or footer,” earlier in this 
chapter, for instructions on how to do this.
	
3.	Open the RSS widget’s drop-down list to display the options you can 
configure for the RSS widget, as shown in Figure 10-15.
	
4.	In the Enter the RSS Feed URL Here text box, type the RSS URL of the 
blog (or site) you want to add.
	
	 You can usually find the RSS feed URL of a blog (or a site) listed in its 
sidebar.
	
5.	(Optional) Type the title of the RSS widget.
	
	 This title is what appears in your site above the links from the site. If I 
wanted to add the RSS feed from my personal site, for example, I’d type 
Lisa’s Site.
	
6.	Select the number of items (from 1 to 20) from the RSS feed to display 
on your site.
	
7.	(Optional) Select the following options as desired:
	
•	Display Item Content: Select this check box if you want WordPress 
to also display the content of the feed (usually, the content of the 
post from the feed URL). If you want to display only the title, leave 
this check box deselected.

165
 Chapter 10: Working with the Default Theme: Twenty Thirteen
RSS widget
Figure 10-15: The RSS widget options.
	
•	Display Item Author If Available: Select this option if you want to 
display the author’s name along with the item’s title.
	
•	Display Item Date: Select this option if you want to display the date 
the item was published along with the item title.
	
8.	Click the Save button.
	
	 WordPress saves all the options you’ve just set and reloads the Widgets 
page with your RSS widget intact.

hen you start your journey in web design using the WordPress plat-
form, your tasks often dip into the development and design sides of 
creating websites. Designing websites with WordPress is more than simply 
putting pretty graphics on display; it involves some knowledge of how to use 
WordPress templates and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) to make the website 
function and look the way you want it to.
Before you take the big dive and dig in to the code and functions necessary 
to a WordPress theme for your website, you need at least a basic understand-
ing of the programming languages in play. Many, if not all, of the function and 
template tags for WordPress use the Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP) language. 
When combined with the WordPress core code, these tags make things (such 
as displaying post content, categories, archives, links, and more) happen on 
your website.
One of the reasons WordPress is the most popular content management 
system (CMS) is that you don’t really need to know PHP code to use it. That’s 
to say, you can use WordPress easily without ever looking at any of the code 
or template files contained within it. However, if you want to tweak the set-
tings of your WordPress theme (as described in Chapters 12, 13, and 14), you 
need to understand the basics of how PHP works. But don’t worry; you don’t 
need to be a PHP programmer.
This chapter introduces you to the very basics of PHP and MySQL, which is 
the database system that stores your WordPress data. You find out how PHP 
and MySQL work together with the WordPress platform to serve up your 

168
Part III: Working with WordPress Themes 
website in visitors’ browsers. This chapter also introduces you to some basic 
WordPress theme concepts, such as a vital function referred to as The Loop. 
You gain an understanding of template parts and template tag parameters 
to prepare you for the upcoming chapters in this book that delve deep into 
WordPress themes, template files, and functions.
Understanding How PHP and  
MySQL Work Together
WordPress uses a PHP/MySQL platform, which provides everything you need 
to create your own site and publish your own content dynamically, without 
knowing how to program those pages. In short, all your content is stored in a 
MySQL database in your hosting account.
	
PHP is a server-side scripting language for creating dynamic web pages. When 
a visitor opens a page built in PHP, the server processes the PHP commands 
and then sends the results to the visitor’s browser. MySQL is an open-source 
relational database management system (RDBMS) that uses Structured Query 
Language (SQL), the most popular language for adding, accessing, and pro-
cessing data in a database. If all that sounds like Greek to you, just think of 
MySQL as a big filing cabinet where all the content on your site is stored.
Every time visitors go to your site to read your content, they make a request 
that’s sent to a host server. The PHP programming language receives that 
request, makes a call to the MySQL database, obtains the requested informa-
tion from the database, and then presents the requested information to your 
visitors through their web browsers.
Here content refers to the data stored in the MySQL database — that is, 
your blog posts, pages, comments, links, and options that you set up on the 
WordPress Dashboard. However, the theme (or design) you choose to use for 
your site — whether it’s the default theme, one you create, or one you have 
custom-designed — isn’t part of the content in this case. Theme files are part 
of the file system and aren’t stored in the database. So creating and keeping a 
backup of any theme files that you’re currently using are good ideas.
	
Chapter 8 covers important information about how to back up your 
WordPress website with the BackupBuddy plugin (http://ithemes.com/
purchase/backupbuddy).
Exploring PHP Basics
WordPress requires PHP to work; therefore, your web- hosting provider must 
have PHP enabled on your web server. If you already have WordPress up and 

169
 Chapter 11: Dissecting Themes and Templates
running on your website (as described in Chapter 3), you know PHP is run-
ning and working just fine. Currently, the PHP version required for the latest 
version of WordPress is PHP 5.2.4, or greater.
Before you play around with template tags (which I cover in Chapter 12) in 
your WordPress templates or plugin functions, you need to understand what 
makes up a template tag, as well as the correct syntax, or function, for a tem-
plate tag as it relates to PHP. Additionally, take a look at the WordPress files 
contained within the download files. Many of the files end with the file exten-
sion .php — an extension required for PHP files, which separates them from 
other file types like JavaScript (.js) or CSS (.css).
This book doesn’t turn you into a PHP programmer or MySQL database 
administrator, but it gives you a glimpse of how PHP and MySQL work 
together to help WordPress build your website. If you’re interested in find-
ing out how to program PHP or become a MySQL database administrator, 
check out PHP & MySQL For Dummies by Janet Valade (Wiley). You can also 
check out a very cool resource on the web called Codeacademy — http://
codeacademy.com — a website where you can learn to code, for free, with 
interactive examples and lessons for HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript, jQuery, and 
more.
Examining the makeup of a template tag
As I state earlier, WordPress is based in PHP (a scripting language for creat-
ing web pages) and uses PHP commands to pull information from the MySQL 
database. Every tag begins with a function to start PHP and ends with a func-
tion to stop it. In the middle of those two commands lives the request to the 
database that tells WordPress to grab the data and display it.
A typical template tag, or function, looks like this:
<?php get_info(); ?>
This example tells WordPress to do three things:
	
✓	<?php: Start PHP.
	
✓	get_info();: Use PHP to get information from the MySQL database 
and deliver it to your site.
	
✓	?>: Stop PHP.
In this case, get_info() represents the tag function, which grabs informa-
tion from the database to deliver it to your site. The information retrieved 
depends on what tag function appears between the two PHP commands. 

170
Part III: Working with WordPress Themes 
	
Every PHP command you start requires a stop command. For every <?php, 
you must include the closing ?> command somewhere later in the code. PHP 
commands structured improperly cause really ugly errors on your site, and 
they’ve been known to send programmers, developers, and hosting providers 
into loud screaming fits. You find a lot of starting and stopping of PHP 
throughout the WordPress templates and functions. The process seems as 
though it’d be resource-intensive, if not exhaustive — but it really isn’t.
	
Always make sure the PHP start and stop commands are separated from the 
function with a single space. You must have a space after <?php and a space 
before ?> — if not, the PHP function code doesn’t work. So make sure the 
code looks like this: <?php get_info(); ?> — not like this: <?phpget_
info();?>.
Trying out a little PHP
To make sure you understand the basics of PHP, including how to start and stop 
PHP within a file, try your hand at a little sample of PHP code. Follow these steps 
to create a simple HTML web page with an embedded PHP function:
	
1.	Open a new, blank file in your default text editor — Notepad 
(Windows) or TextMate (Mac) — then type <html> and press Enter.
	
	 The <html> tag tells the web browser that this is an HTML document 
and should be read as a web page.
	
2.	Type <head> and then press Enter.
	
	 The <head> HTML tag contains elements that tell the web browser 
about the document; this information is read by the browser but hidden 
from the web page visitor.
	
3.	Type <title>This is a Simple PHP Page</title> and then 
press Enter.
	
	 The <title> HTML tag tells the browser to display the text between 
the two tags as the title of the document in the browser title bar.
	
	 All HTML tags need to be opened and then closed, just like PHP tags that 
I describe in the preceding section. In this case, the <title> tag opens 
the command, and the </title> tag closes it and tells the web browser 
that you’re finished dealing with the title.
	
4.	Type </head> to close the <head> tag from Step 2 and then press 
Enter.
	
5.	Type <body> to define the body of the web page and then press Enter.
	
	 Anything that appears after this tag appears in the web browser 
window.

171
 Chapter 11: Dissecting Themes and Templates
	
6.	Type <?php to tell the web browser to start a PHP function and then 
press Enter.
	
	 See the preceding section on starting and stopping PHP functions.
	
7.	Type echo ‘<p>Testing my new PHP function</p>’; and then 
press Enter.
	
	 This is the function that you want PHP to execute on your web page. 
This particular function echoes the text, “Testing my new PHP function” 
and displays it on your website.
	
8.	Type ?> (be sure to insert a space before) to tell the web browser to 
end the PHP function and then press Enter.
	
9.	Type </body> to close the <body> HTML tag from Step 5 and then 
press Enter.
	
	 This tells the web browser that you’re done with the body of the web 
page.
	
10.	Type </html> to close the <html> tag from Step 1 and then press 
Enter.
	
	 This tells the web browser that you’re at the end of the HTML document.
When you’re done with Steps 1 through 10, double-check that the code in 
your text editor looks like this:
<html>
<head>
<title>This is a Simple PHP Page</title>
</head>
<body>
 <?php echo ‘<p>Testing my new PHP function</p>’; ?> 
</body>
</html>
After you write your code, follow these steps to save and upload your file:
	
1.	Save the file to your local computer as testing.php.
	
2.	Upload the testing.php file via File Transfer Protocol (FTP) to the 
root directory of your web server.
	
	 If you need details on how to use FTP to transfer files to your web 
server, check out Chapter 5.
	
3.	Open a web browser and type the address http://yourdomain.
com/testing.php in the web browser’s address bar.
	
	 In this example, yourdomain.com is your actual domain name.
	
	 A single line of text displays Testing my new PHP function, as 
shown in Figure 11-1.

172
Part III: Working with WordPress Themes 
Figure 11-1: A basic PHP page in a browser.
If the testing.php file appears correctly in your browser, congratulations! 
You programmed PHP to work in a web browser.
	
If the testing.php file does not appear correctly in your browser, you see 
some common PHP error messages that indicate what errors exist in your 
code (usually it gives the error message plus the line number where the error 
exists in the file).
Managing Your MySQL Database
A lot of new WordPress users are pretty intimidated by the MySQL database, 
perhaps because it seems to be way above their technical skills or abilities. 
Truth be told, regular WordPress users — those who just use it to publish 
content — don’t really ever have to dig into the database unless they want to. 
You need to explore the database only if you’re dealing with theme or plugin 
development, or contributing code to the WordPress project. In this section, 
I give you a basic overview of the WordPress database stored in MySQL so 
that you have an understanding of the structure and know where items are 
stored.
	
Currently, WordPress requires MySQL version 5.0 (or greater) to work cor-
rectly. If your web-hosting provider doesn’t have 5.0 (or greater) installed on 
your web server, kindly ask to upgrade.
After you install WordPress on your server (which I discuss in Chapter 3), 
the database gets populated with 11 tables that exist to store different types 
of data from your WordPress site. Figure 11-2 displays the structure of the 
tables, as follows:
	
✓	wp_commentmeta: This table stores every comment published to your 
site containing information, or metadata, that includes
	
•	A unique comment ID number.
	
•	A comment meta key, meta value, and meta ID — the meta informa-
tion here are unique identifiers assigned to each comment left by 
you, or visitors, on your site.

173
 Chapter 11: Dissecting Themes and Templates
Figure 11-2: The WordPress database structure.
	
✓	wp_comments: This table stores the body of the comments published to 
your site, including
	
•	A post ID that specifies which post the comment belongs to
	
•	The comment content
	
•	The comment author’s name, URL, IP address, and e-mail address
	
•	The comment date (day, month, year, and time)
	
•	The comment status (approved, unapproved, or spam)
	
✓	wp_links: This stores the name, URL, and description of all links you 
create using the WordPress Link Manager; it also stores all the advanced 
options for the links you created, if any.
	
✓	wp_options: This stores all the option settings that you set for WordPress 
after you install it, including all theme and plugin option settings.
	
✓	wp_postmeta: This includes all posts or pages published to your site 
and contains metadata that includes
	
•	The unique post ID number (each blog post has a unique ID 
number to set it apart from the others).
	
•	The post meta key, meta id, and meta value — the meta informa-
tion here are unique identifiers assigned to every post on your site 
and any custom fields you’ve created for the post.

174
Part III: Working with WordPress Themes 
	
✓	wp_posts: This table features the body of any post or page you’ve pub-
lished, including autosaved revisions and post option settings, such as
	
•	The post author, date, and time
	
•	The post title, content, and excerpt
	
•	The post status (published, draft, or private)
	
•	The post comment status (open or closed)
	
•	The post type (page, post, or custom post type)
	
•	The post comment count
	
✓	wp_terms: This stores the categories you’ve created for posts and links 
as well as tags that have been created for your posts.
	
✓	wp_term_relationships: This stores the relationships among the 
posts as well as the categories and tags that have been assigned to 
them.
	
✓	wp_term_taxonomy: WordPress has three types of taxonomies by 
default: category, link, and tag. This table stores the taxonomy associ-
ated for the terms stored in the wp_terms table.
	
✓	wp_usermeta: This table features metadata from every user with an 
account on your WordPress website. This metadata includes
	
•	A unique user ID
	
•	A user meta key, meta value, and meta ID — the meta information 
here includes unique identifiers for each user on your site
	
✓	wp_users: The list of users with an account on your WordPress website 
is maintained within this table and includes information like
	
•	The username, first name, last name, and nickname
	
•	The user login
	
•	The user password
	
•	The user e-mail
	
•	The registration date
	
•	The user status and role (subscriber, contributor, author, editor, 
or administrator)
Most web-hosting providers provide you with a utility, or an interface, to view 
your MySQL database, and the most common one is phpMyAdmin, as shown 
in Figure 11-2. If you’re unsure how you can view your database on your host-
ing account, get in touch with your hosting provider to find out.

 Chapter 11: Dissecting Themes and Templates
Viewing the Template Files in a WordPress Theme
A WordPress theme is a collection of WordPress templates made up of 
WordPress template tags. When I refer to a WordPress theme, I’m talking 
about the group of templates that makes up the theme. When I talk about a 
WordPress template, I’m referring to only one of the template files that con-
tains WordPress template tags. WordPress template tags make all the tem-
plates work together as a theme (more about this topic later in the chapter).
The rest of this chapter provides important information about the steps to 
take when building a WordPress theme, but here, I give you a brief overview 
of the templates that make up a WordPress theme and where you find them, 
both on your server and on your WordPress Dashboard. Follow these steps:
	
1.	Connect to your web server via FTP and look at the existing 
WordPress themes on your server in the folder /wp-content/
themes. See the left side of Figure 11-3.
	
	 When you open this folder, you find the /twentythirteen theme 
folder.
Figure 11-3: Themes in the /wp-content/themes folder.

176
Part III: Working with WordPress Themes 
	
	 If a theme is uploaded to any folder other than /wp-content/themes, 
it won’t work.
	
2.	Open the folder for the Twenty Thirteen theme (/wp-content/
themes/twentythirteen) and look at the template files inside, as 
shown in the right side of Figure 11-3.
	
	 When you open the Twenty Thirteen theme folder, you see several files. 
At a minimum, you find these five templates in any theme:
	
•	Stylesheet (style.css)
	
•	Header template (header.php)
	
•	Main Index (index.php)
	
•	Sidebar template (sidebar.php)
	
•	Footer template (footer.php)
	
	 These files are the main WordPress template files, which I discuss in 
more detail in the next section. Take a peek inside these files and see 
the different template functions they contain. These filenames are the 
same in every WordPress theme. (Chapter 12 contains more information 
about these template files.)
	
3.	On your WordPress Dashboard, choose Appearance➪Editor to look at 
the template files within a theme.
	
	 The Edit Themes page appears and lists the various templates available 
within the active theme. Figure 11-4 shows the templates in the default 
Twenty Thirteen theme. A text box in the center of the screen displays 
the contents of each template, and this box is also where you can edit

the right side of the page.
The Edit Themes page also shows the template tags within the template 
file. These tags make all the magic happen in your site; they connect all the 
templates to form a theme. Chapter 12 provides steps for putting them all 
together to create your own theme (or to edit an existing theme).
	
Below the text box on the Edit Themes page is the Documentation drop-down 
list for every file you edit, except style.css. Click the arrow on the right 
side of the menu, and a list drops down that contains all the template tags 
used in the template you’re currently viewing. This list is helpful when you 
edit templates and it gives you some insight into the different template tags 
used to create functions and features within your WordPress theme.

Figure 11-4: A list of templates available in the default Twenty Thirteen WordPress theme.
The template files don’t work alone; for the theme to function, the files need 
one another. To tie these files together as one working entity, use template 
tags to pull the information from each template — Header, Sidebar, and 
Footer — into the Main Index. I refer to this procedure as calling one tem-
plate into another.
Examining the Templates That  
Make Up a WordPress Theme
Creating themes requires you to step into the code of the templates, which 
can be a scary place sometimes — especially if you don’t really know what 
you’re looking at. A good place to start is by understanding the structure 
of a WordPress theme. A WordPress theme, in its very basic form, has four 

178
Part III: Working with WordPress Themes 
main areas that appear in the default theme that comes in every version of 
WordPress:
	
✓	Header: This area usually contains the name of the site along with the 
site tagline or slogan. Sometimes, the header also contains a graphic or 
image.
	
✓	Body: This area is where your content (such as blog posts, pages, and 
so on) appears in chronological order.
	
✓	Sidebar: This area is where you find lists of navigation elements such as 
the blogroll, the archives, and a list of recent posts.
	
✓	Footer: This area, at the bottom of the page, often contains links to 
further information about the site, such as who designed it, which com-
pany provides hosting for the site, and copyright information.
These four areas are the absolute bare bones of a basic WordPress site 
theme. You can extend these areas and create new sections that carry more 
information, of course, but for the purpose of this chapter, I focus on the 
basics.
The default WordPress theme is Twenty Thirteen (discussed in detail in 
Chapter 10), and in my opinion, it’s a pretty doggone wonderful starting point 
for you, especially if you’re just getting your feet wet. I don’t cover all the 
tags and templates that the Twenty Thirteen theme includes; rather, I touch 
on the basics to get you on your way to understanding templates and tem-
plate tags for WordPress.
To build a basic WordPress theme that covers the four basic areas of a site, 
you need these five templates:
	
✓	header.php (Header)
	
✓	index.php (Main Index)
	
✓	sidebar.php (Sidebar)
	
✓	footer.php (Footer)
	
✓	style.css (Stylesheet)
Each WordPress theme comes with a stylesheet (style.css), which drives 
the formatting and layout of your site theme in terms of where the elements 
are positioned on the page, what the font looks like, what colors your hyper-
links will be, and so on. As you may have already figured out, you don’t use 
CSS to put content on your site; rather, you use CSS to style the content 
that’s already there.

179
 Chapter 11: Dissecting Themes and Templates
	
Chapter 14 provides information on tweaking the design of your theme by 
combining the template tags presented in this chapter with some CSS adjust-
ments in your theme files.
In the following sections, I cover only the basic templates in a WordPress 
theme; in Chapter 12, however, I provide some ideas on how you can use 
various templates to further extend your website functionality — using tem-
plates for categories, archives, static pages, multiple sidebars, and so on. 
After you build the basics, you can spread your wings and step into more 
advanced themes.
The stylesheet
Every WordPress theme includes a style.css file. A browser uses this file, 
commonly known as the stylesheet, to provide style to the website design, 
such as font types, colors, and sizes; graphics; icons; background colors; bor-
ders; and other styling elements. The stylesheet targets areas of the site to 
style using CSS IDs and classes (covered in Chapter 14). CSS IDs and classes 
are simply a means of naming a particular element of the site. IDs are used 
for elements that appear only once on a page, whereas classes can be used as 
many times as you need. Although this file references style, it contains much 
more information about the theme.
At the very beginning of the style.css file, a comment block, or the 
stylesheet header, passes information about your theme to WordPress. 
Comments are code statements included only for programmers, developers, 
and others who read the code. Computers tend to ignore comment state-
ments entirely, but WordPress uses the stylesheet header to get information 
about your theme. In CSS, comments always begin with a forward slash (/) 
followed by a star (*), and always end with a star followed by a forward  
slash (*/). The following code listing shows an example of the stylesheet 
header for the Twenty Thirteen theme:
/*
Theme Name: Twenty Thirteen
Theme URI: http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/twentythirteen
Author: the WordPress team
Author URI: http://wordpress.org/
Description: The 2013 theme for WordPress takes us back to the blog, featuring 
a full range of post formats, each displayed beautifully in their 
own unique way. Design details abound, starting with a gorgeous 
color scheme and matching header images, optional display fonts 
for beautiful typography, and a wide layout that looks great on 
large screens yet remains device-agnostic and is readable on any 
device.

If you make modifications to the stylesheet comments, the changes are 
reflected on the WordPress Dashboard on the Themes page (choose 
Appearance➪Themes).
	
Themes must provide this information, by way of comments, in the 
stylesheet header, and no two themes can have the same information. Two 
themes with the same name and details would conflict in the Manage Themes 
page. If you create your own theme based on another theme, make sure you 
change this information first.
Below the stylesheet header are the CSS styles that drive the formatting and 
styling of your theme. Chapter 14 goes into detail about CSS, including some 
examples you can use to tweak the style of your existing WordPress theme — 
check it out.
The Main Index and The Loop
Your theme is required to have only two files. The first is style.css 
(described in the preceding section). The other is a Main Index file, known 
in WordPress as index.php. The index.php file is the first file WordPress 
tries to load when someone visits your site. Extremely flexible, index.php 
can be used as a stand-alone file or can include other templates. The Main 
Index template drags your posts out of the MySQL database and inserts them 
into your site. This template is to your website what the dance floor is to a 
nightclub — where all the action happens.
The first template tag in the Main Index template calls in the Header tem-
plate, meaning that it pulls the information from the Header template into the 
Main Index template, as follows:
<?php get_header(); ?>
Your theme can work without calling in the Header template, but it’ll be 
missing several essential pieces — the CSS and the site name and tagline, for 
starters.

181
 Chapter 11: Dissecting Themes and Templates
The Main Index template in the Twenty Thirteen theme calls in three other 
files in a similar fashion:
	
✓	get_template_part( content, get_post_format() );: This 
function calls in the template content.php first, but if there are other 
content template files like content-image.php or content-video.
php, the function will use one of the other template files, depending on 
what post format is being used. (See Chapter 15 for information about 
post formats.)
	
✓	get_sidebar();: This function calls in the template sidebar.php file.
	
✓	get_footer();: This function calls in the template footer.php file.
I cover each of these three functions and template files in upcoming sections 
of this chapter.
	
The concept of calling in a template file using a function or template tag is 
exactly what the Main Index template does with the four functions for the 
Header, Loop, Sidebar, and Footer templates explained later in this section.
Generally, one of the important functions of the Main Index is to contain The 
Loop. In WordPress, The Loop is a function that WordPress uses to display 
posts and pages on your site. Any PHP or HTML that you include in The Loop 
will repeat for each of your posts and pages that it displays. The Loop has a 
starting point and an ending point; anything placed in between is used to dis-
play each post or page, including any HTML, PHP, or CSS tags and codes.
Here’s a look at what the WordPress Codex calls “The World’s Simplest 
Index”:
<?php
get_header();
if (have_posts()) :
   while (have_posts()) :
    the_post();
    the_content();
   endwhile;
endif;
get_sidebar();
get_footer();
?>
First, the template starts by opening the php tag. Next, the template includes 
the header, meaning that it retrieves anything contained in the header.php 
file and displays it. Now the good stuff starts happening. The Loop begins 
with the while (have_posts()) : bit. Anything between while and end-
while repeats for each post that appears. The number of posts that appears 
is determined in the Settings section of the WordPress Dashboard.

182
Part III: Working with WordPress Themes 
If your site has posts (and most do, even when you first install it), WordPress 
proceeds with The Loop, starting with the piece of code that looks like this:
if (have_posts()) :
   while (have_posts()) :
This code tells WordPress to grab the posts from the MySQL database and 
display them on your site.
Then The Loop closes with this tag:
   endwhile;
endif;
Near the beginning of the Loop template is a template tag that looks like this:
if (have_posts()) :
To read that template tag in plain English, it says: If [this site] has 
posts.
If your site meets that condition (that is, if it has posts), WordPress proceeds 
with The Loop and displays your posts; if it does not meet that condition 
(that is, it does not have posts), WordPress displays nothing.
When The Loop ends (at the endwhile), the index.php (Main Index) tem-
plate executes the files for the sidebar and footer. Although it’s simple, The 
Loop is one of the core functions of WordPress.
	
Misplacement of the while or endwhile statement causes The Loop to 
break. If you’re having trouble with The Loop in an existing template, check 
your version against the original and see whether the while statements are 
misplaced.
	
In your travels as a WordPress user, you may run across plugins or scripts 
with instructions that say something like this: This must be placed 
within The Loop. That’s The Loop that I discuss in this section, so pay 
particular attention. Understanding The Loop arms you with the knowledge 
you need for tackling and understanding your WordPress themes.
The Loop is no different from any other template tag; it must begin with a 
function to start PHP, and it must end with a function to stop PHP. The Loop 
begins with PHP and then makes a request: While there are posts 
in my blog, display them on this page. This PHP function tells 
WordPress to grab the post information from the database and return it to 
the site. The end of The Loop is like a traffic cop with a big red stop sign tell-
ing WordPress to stop the function completely.

183
 Chapter 11: Dissecting Themes and Templates
	
You can set the number of posts displayed per page in the Reading Settings 
page (choose Settings➪Reading) on the WordPress Dashboard. The Loop 
abides by this rule and displays only the number of posts per page that 
you’ve set.
The Header template
The Header template is the starting point for every WordPress theme because 
it tells web browsers the following information:
	
✓	The title of your site
	
✓	The location of the CSS
	
✓	The RSS feed URL
	
✓	The site URL
	
✓	The tagline (or description) of the site
In many themes, the first elements in the header are a main image and the 
navigation. These two elements are usually in the header.php file because 
they load on every page and rarely change. The following statement is the 
built-in WordPress function to call the Header template:
<?php get_header(); ?>
	
Every page on the web has to start with a few pieces of code. In every 
header.php file in any WordPress theme, you find these bits of code at  
the top:
	
✓	The DOCTYPE (document type declaration) tells the browser which type 
of XHTML (Extensible Hypertext Markup Language) standards you’re 
using. The Twenty Thirteen theme uses <!DOCTYPE html>, which is a 
declaration for W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) standards compli-
ance mode and covers all major browser systems (and is the markup 
doctype specifically for HTML5).
	
✓	The <html> tag (Hypertext Markup Language) tells the browser which 
language you’re using to write your web pages.
	
✓	The <head> tag tells the browser that the information contained  
within the tag shouldn’t be displayed on the site; rather, it’s information 
about the document.
In the Header template of the Twenty Thirteen theme, these bits of code look 
like the following example, and you need to leave them intact:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html <?php language_attributes(); ?>>
<head>

184
Part III: Working with WordPress Themes 
	
On the Edit Themes page (choose Appearance➪Editor on the WordPress 
Dashboard), click the Header template link to display the template code in 
the text box. Look closely, and you see that the <!DOCTYPE html> declara-
tion, <html> tag, and <head> tag appear in the template.
The <head> tag needs to be closed at the end of the Header template, which 
looks like this: </head>. You also need to include a fourth tag, the <body> 
tag, which tells the browser where the information you want to display 
begins. Both the <body> and <html> tags need to be closed at the end of the 
template, like this: </body></html>.
	
There is one line of code that should exist in every Header template for any 
WordPress theme: <?php wp_head(); ?>. This tag serves as a hook in 
WordPress that plugin developers use to insert necessary code and func-
tions. Without this tag, the majority of plugins for WordPress will not func-
tion correctly, so be sure your Header template includes the tag <?php 
wp_head(); ?> before the closing </head> HTML markup.
Using bloginfo parameters
The Header template makes much use of one WordPress template tag in par-
ticular: bloginfo();.
What differentiates the type of information that a tag pulls in is a parameter. 
Parameters are placed inside the parentheses of the tag, enclosed in single 
quotations. For the most part, these parameters pull information from the 
settings on your WordPress Dashboard. The template tag to get your blog 
title, for example, looks like this:
<?php bloginfo(‘name’); ?>
Table 11-1 lists the various parameters you need for the bloginfo(); tag 
and shows you what the template tag looks like. Some of the parameters in 
The WordPress body class
In WordPress, you want to use the body class 
template tag instead of the generic <body> 
HTML markup. WordPress provides us with the 
body class tag to dynamically generate classes 
that are dependent upon the page you’re view-
ing within your site. The body class tag looks 
like <body <?php body_class(); ?>>, 
and it is the <?php body_class(): ?> 
portion of that code that tells WordPress to 
dynamically generate page-specific classes. 
For example, with the body class tag in place, 
when you are viewing a single post page on 
your site, the body tag dynamically changes 
the classes to <body class=”single 
single-post”>, enabling you to use CSS 
to create styles for different page views within 
your site. (Read more about CSS in Chapter 14.)

Creating title tags
Here’s a useful tip about your site’s <title> tag: Search engines pick up the 
words used in the <title> tag as keywords to categorize your site in their 
search engine directories.
The <title></title> tags are HTML tags that tell the browser to display 
the title of your website in the title bar of a visitor’s browser window.
Search engines love the title bar. The more you can tweak that title to provide 
detailed descriptions of your site (otherwise known as search engine optimiza-
tion, or SEO), the more the search engines will love your site. Browsers will 
show that love by giving your site higher rankings in their results. (For more 
information and tips on SEO with WordPress, see Chapter 15.)
The site <title> tag is the code that lives in the Header template between 
these two tag markers: <title></title>. In the default Twenty Thirteen 
theme, this bit of code looks like this (don’t let this code scare you — I prom-
ise I will break it down for you!):
<title><?php wp_title( ‘|’, true, ‘right’ ); ?></title> 

186
Part III: Working with WordPress Themes 
It may help to put this example into plain English. The way the Twenty 
Thirteen Header template displays the title is based on the type of page that 
appears — and it shrewdly uses SEO to help you with the browser powers 
that be.
	
The title bar of the browser window always displays your site name unless 
you’re on a single post page. In that case, it displays your site title plus the 
title of the post on that page.
Within some of the WordPress template tags, such as the <title> tag in the 
earlier example, you may notice some weird characters that look like a for-
eign language. You may wonder what &raquo; is, for example; it isn’t part of 
any PHP function or CSS style. Rather, &raquo; is a character entity — a kind 
of code that enables you to display a special character. The &raquo; charac-
ter entity displays a double right-angle quotation mark.
Displaying your site name and tagline
The default Twenty Thirteen theme header displays your site name and tag-
line on the top of your site, on every page. You can use the bloginfo(); tag 
plus a little HTML code to display your site name and tagline. Most sites have 
a clickable title, which is a site title that takes you back to the home page 
when it’s clicked. No matter where your visitors are on your site, they can 
always go back home by clicking the title of your site in the header.
To create a clickable title, use the following code:
<a href=”<?php bloginfo(‘url’); ?>”><?php bloginfo(‘name’); ?></a>
The bloginfo(‘url’); tag is your main Internet address, and the 
bloginfo(‘name’); tag is the name of your site (refer to Table 11-1). So 
the code creates a link that looks something like this:
<a href=”http://yourdomain.com”>Your Blog Name</a>
The tagline generally isn’t linked back home. You can display it by using the 
following tag:
<?php bloginfo(‘description’); ?>
This tag pulls the tagline directly from the one that you’ve set up on the  
General Settings page on your WordPress Dashboard (choose Settings➪ 
General).
This example shows how WordPress is intuitive and user-friendly; you can 
do things like change the site name and tagline with a few keystrokes on the 
Dashboard. Changing your options on the Dashboard creates the change on 
every page of your site — no coding experience required. Beautiful, isn’t it?

187
 Chapter 11: Dissecting Themes and Templates
In the Twenty Thirteen templates, these tags are surrounded by tags that 
look like these: <h1></h1> or <h2></h2>. These tags are <header> tags, 
which define the look and layout of the site name and tagline in the CSS of 
your theme. (I cover CSS and tackle basic HTML markup in Chapter 14.)
The Sidebar template
The Sidebar template in WordPress has the filename sidebar.php. The 
sidebar is usually found on the left or right side of the main content area of 
your WordPress theme. (In the Twenty Thirteen theme, the sidebar appears 
to the right of the main content area.) The sidebar is a good place to put 
useful information about your site, such as a site summary, advertisements, 
or testimonials.
Many themes use widget areas in the Sidebar template. This allows you to 
display content easily on your WordPress pages and posts. The following 
statement is the built-in WordPress function to call the Sidebar template:
<?php get_sidebar(); ?>
This code calls the Sidebar template and all the information it contains into 
your site. (For more information on widgets, see Chapter 10.)
The Footer template
The Footer template in WordPress has the filename footer.php. The footer 
is generally at the bottom of the page and contains brief reference informa-
tion about the site. This usually includes copyright information, template 
design credits, and a mention of WordPress. Similar to the Header and 
Sidebar templates, the Footer template gets called into the Main Index tem-
plate through this bit of code:
<?php get_footer(); ?>
This code calls the Footer template and all the information it contains into 
your site.
The default Twenty Thirteen theme shows a statement that says Proudly 
powered by WordPress. You can use the footer to include all sorts of infor-
mation about your site, however; you don’t have to restrict it to small bits of 
information.
	
There is one line of code that should exist in every Footer template for any 
WordPress theme: <?php wp_footer(); ?>. This tag serves as a hook 
in WordPress that plugin developers use to insert necessary code and 
functions. Without this tag, the majority of plugins for WordPress will not 
function correctly, so be sure your Footer template includes the tag <?php 
wp_footer(); ?> before the closing </html> HTML markup.

188
Part III: Working with WordPress Themes 
Other template files
To make your website work properly, WordPress uses all the theme files 
together. Some, such as the header and footer, are used on every page. 
Others, such as the Comments template (comments.php), are used only at 
specific times, to pull in specific functions. When someone visits your site, 
WordPress uses a series of queries to determine which templates to use.
You can include many more templates in your theme. Here are some of the 
other template files you may want to use:
	
✓	Comments template (comments.php): The Comments template is 
required if you plan to host comments on your blog; it provides all the 
template tags you need to display those comments. The template tag 
used to call the comments into the template is <?php comments_ 
template(); ?>.
	
✓	Single Post template (single.php): When your visitors click the title or 
permalink of a post you’ve published, they’re taken to that post’s indi-
vidual page. There, they can read the entire post, and if you have com-
ments enabled, they see the comments form and can leave comments.
	
✓	Page template (page.php): You can use a Page template for static pages 
in your WordPress site.
	
✓	Search Results template (search.php): You can use this template 
to create a custom display of search results. When someone uses the 
search feature to search your site for specific keywords, this template 
formats the return of those results.
	
✓	404 template (404.php): Use this template to create a custom 404 page, 
which is the page visitors get when the browser can’t find the page 
requested and returns that ugly 404 Page Cannot Be Found error.
	
The templates in the preceding list are optional. If these templates don’t exist 
in your WordPress themes folder, nothing breaks. The Main Index template 
handles the display of these items (the single post page, the search results 
page, and so on). The only exception is the Comments template. If you want 
to display comments on your site, you must have that template included in 
your theme.
Exploring Template Tags, Values, and Parameters
I cover a full breakdown and explanation of WordPress template tags in 
Chapter 12, introducing the concept of parameters and values, and how to 
use them, as well as the different types of parameters. You should have a 
primary grasp of these concepts before moving forward with using template 
tags within your WordPress theme files.

189
 Chapter 11: Dissecting Themes and Templates
If every piece of content on your site were hard-coded, it wouldn’t be easy 
to use and modify. Template tags allow you to add information and content 
dynamically to your site. One example of adding information using a template 
tag is the the_category tag. Rather than typing all the categories and links 
that each post belongs in, you can use the the_category() tag in your tem-
plate to automatically display all the categories as links.
When you use a template tag, you’re really telling WordPress to do some-
thing or retrieve some information. Often, template tags are used to fetch 
data from the MySQL database and display it on your website. More than 100 
template tags are built in to WordPress, and the tags vary greatly in what 
they can accomplish. You can view a complete list of template tags in the 
WordPress Codex at http://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags.
Template tags can be used only inside PHP blocks. The PHP blocks can be 
opened and closed as many times as needed in a template file. Once opened, 
the server knows that anything contained in the block is to be translated  
as PHP.
The opening tag (<?php) must be followed, at some point, by the closing  
tag (?>). All blocks must contain these tags. A template tag is used in the 
same way that PHP functions are. The tag is always text with no spaces (may 
be separated by underscores or dashes), with opening and closing brackets, 
and with a semicolon. The following line of code shows you how it all looks:
<?php template_tag_name(); ?>
Because a template tag is a PHP function, you can pass parameters to the tag. 
A parameter is simply a variable that allows you to change or filter the output 
of a template tag. Here are the three types of template tags in WordPress:
	
✓	Tags without parameters: Some template tags don’t require any options, 
so they don’t need any parameters passed to them. For example, the 
is_user_logged_in() tag doesn’t accept any parameters because it 
returns only true or false.
	
✓	Tags with PHP function–style parameters: Template tags with PHP 
function–style parameters accept parameters that are passed to them 
by placing one or more values inside the function’s parentheses. For 
example, if you’re using the bloginfo(); tag, you can filter the output 
to just the description by using
<?php bloginfo(‘description’); ?>
	
	If there are multiple parameters, the order you list them is very impor-
tant. Each function sets the necessary order of its variables, so double-
check the order of your parameters.
	
	Always place the value in single quotations and separate multiple 
parameters by commas.

190
Part III: Working with WordPress Themes 
	
✓	Tags with query string–style parameters: Template tags with query 
string–style parameters allow you to change the values of just the 
parameters you require. This is useful for template tags that have a 
large number of options. For example, the wp_list_pages() tag has 18 
parameters. Rather than using the PHP function–style parameters, this 
function allows you to get to the source of what you need and give it a 
value. For example, if you want to list all your WordPress pages except 
for page 24, you’d use
<?php wp_list_pages(‘exclude=24’); ?>
	
	Query string–style parameters can be the most difficult to work with 
because they generally deal with the template tags that have the most 
possible parameters.
Table 11-2 helps you understand the three variations of parameters used by 
WordPress.

WordPress software; in addition, I go into greater depth on template tags and 
parameters you can use to create the features and content display that you 

191
 Chapter 11: Dissecting Themes and Templates
need for your website in Chapter 12. The tags and parameters that I share 
with you in this chapter are the very basic ones most commonly used in just 
about every WordPress theme available.
Customizing Your Blog Posts with Template Tags
This section covers the template tags that you use to display the body of 
each blog post you publish. The body of a blog post includes information 
such as the post date and time, title, author name, category, and content. 
Table 11-3 lists the common template tags you can use for posts, available in 
any WordPress theme template. The tags in Table 11-3 work only if you place 
them within The Loop (which I cover earlier in this chapter and is found in 
the loop.php template file).
Table 11-3	
Template Tags for Blog Posts
Tag
Function
get_the_date();
Displays the date of the post.
get_the_time();
Displays the time of the post.
the_title();
Displays the title of the post.
the_permalink();
Displays the permalink (URL) of the post.
get_the_author();
Displays the post author’s name.
the_author_link();
Displays the URL of the post author’s site.
the_content(‘Read 
More...’);
Displays the full content of the post.
the_excerpt();
Displays an excerpt (snippet) of the post.
the_category();
Displays the category (or categories) 
assigned to the post. If the post is 
assigned to multiple categories, they’re 
separated by commas.
comments_popup_link(‘No 
Comments’, ‘Comment 
(1)’, ‘Comments(%)’); 
Displays a link to the comments, along 
with the comment count for the post in 
parentheses. (If no comments exist, a 
No Comments message displays.)
next_posts_link(‘&laquo; 
Previous Entries’)
Displays a Previous Entries link that links 
to the previous page of blog entries.
previous_posts_link(‘Next 
Entries &raquo;’) 
Displays the Next Entries link that links to 
the next page of blog entries.

192
Part III: Working with WordPress Themes 
	
The last two tags in the table aren’t like the others. You don’t place these 
tags in The Loop; instead, you insert them after The Loop but before the if 
statement ends. Here’s an example:
<?php endwhile; ?>
<?php next_posts_link(‘&laquo; Previous Entries’) ?>
<?php previous_posts_link(‘Next Entries &raquo;’) ?>
<?php endif; ?>
Putting It All Together
Template files can’t do a whole lot by themselves — the real power comes 
when they’re put together.
Connecting the templates
WordPress has built-in functions to include the main template files, such 
as header.php, sidebar.php, and footer.php, in other templates. An 
include function is a custom PHP function that’s built in to WordPress 
allowing you to retrieve the content of one template file and display it along 
with the content of another template file. Table 11-4 shows the templates and 
the function to include them.
Table 11-4	
Template Files and Include Functions
Template Name
Include Function
header.php
<?php get_header(); ?>
sidebar.php
<?php get_sidebar(); ?>
footer.php
<?php get_footer(); ?>
search.php
<?php get_search_form(); ?>
comments.php
<?php comments_template(); ?>
If you want to include a file that doesn’t have a built-in include function, 
you need a different piece of code. For instance, if you want to add a unique 
sidebar (different from the default sidebar.php file within your existing 
theme) to a certain page template, you can name the sidebar file sidebar-
page.php. To include that in another template, you use the following code:
<?php get_template_part(‘sidebar’, ‘page’); ?>

193
 Chapter 11: Dissecting Themes and Templates
In this statement, the PHP get_template_part function looks through the 
main theme folder for the sidebar-page.php file and displays the content 
from the sidebar-page.php file. If it does not find that file, WordPress 
defaults to displaying the sidebar.php file.
In the following sections, you put together the guts of a basic Main Index 
template by using the information on templates and tags I provide in the 
previous sections of this chapter. There seem to be endless lines of code 
when you view the loop.php template file in the Twenty Thirteen theme, so 
I’ve simplified it for you. These steps give you a basic understanding of the 
WordPress Loop and the common template tags and functions you can use to 
create your own.
Creating basic WordPress templates
You create a new WordPress theme by using some of the basic WordPress 
templates. The first steps in pulling everything together are as follows:
	
1.	Connect to your web server via FTP, click the /wp-content folder, 
and then click the /themes folder.
	
	 This folder contains the themes currently installed in your WordPress 
site. (See Chapter 5 if you need more information on FTP.)
	
2.	Create a new folder and name it mytheme.
	
	 In most FTP programs, you can right-click and choose New Folder. (If 
you aren’t sure how to create a folder, refer to your FTP program’s help 
files.)
	
3.	In your favored text editor, such as Notepad (Windows) or TextMate 
(Mac), create the Header template with the code in Listing 11-1 and 
then save with the filename header.php.
	
	 When typing templates, be sure to use a text editor, such as Notepad or 
TextMate. Using a word processing program, such as Microsoft Word, 
opens a whole slew of problems in your code. Word processing pro-
grams insert hidden characters and format quotation marks in a way 
that WordPress can’t read.
Listing 11-1:  header.php
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html <?php language_attributes(); ?> />
<head profile=”http://gmpg.org/xfn/11”>
<meta http-equiv=”Content-Type” content=”<?php bloginfo(‘html_type’); ?>; 
charset=<?php bloginfo(‘charset’); ?>” />
<title><?php bloginfo( ‘name’ ); ?> <?php if ( is_single() ) { ?> &raquo; Blog 
Archive <?php } ?> 
(continued)

194
Part III: Working with WordPress Themes 
Listing 11‑1 (continued)
<?php wp_title(); ?></title>
<link rel=”stylesheet” href=”<?php bloginfo( ‘stylesheet_url’ ); ?>” type=”text/
css” media=”screen” />
<link rel=”pingback” href=”<?php bloginfo( ‘pingback_url’ ); ?>” />
<?php if ( is_singular() ) wp_enqueue_script( ‘comment-reply’ ); ?>
<?php wp_head(); ?>
</head>
<body <?php body_class() ?>>
<div id=”page”>
<header id=”header”>
<h1><a href=”<?php bloginfo(‘url’); ?>”><?php bloginfo(‘name’); ?></a></h1>
<h2><?php bloginfo(‘description’); ?></h2>
</header>
<section>
	
4.	Create a theme functions file with the code in Listing 11-2 and then 
save with the filename functions.php.
	
	The theme functions file registers the widget area for your site so that 
you can add widgets to your sidebar using the available WordPress wid-
gets on the Widgets page on the Dashboard.
Listing 11-2:  functions.php
<?php
if ( function_exists(‘register_sidebar’) ) register_sidebar(array(‘name’=>’Side
bar’,
));
?>
	
5.	Create a Sidebar template file with the code in Listing 11-3 and then 
save with the filename sidebar.php.
	
	 The code here tells WordPress where you want the WordPress widgets 
to appear in your theme; in this case, widgets appear in the sidebar of 
your site.
Listing 11-3:  sidebar.php
<aside id=”side” class=”sidebar”>
<ul>
<?php if ( !function_exists(‘dynamic_sidebar’) || !dynamic_sidebar(‘Sidebar’) ) 
: ?>
<?php endif; ?>
</ul>
</aside>

195
 Chapter 11: Dissecting Themes and Templates
	
6.	Create the Footer template file with the code in Listing 11-4 and then 
save it with the filename footer.php.
Listing 11-4:  footer.php
</div>
<footer id=”footer”>
<p>&copy; Copyright <a href=”<?php bloginfo(‘url’); ?>”><?php bloginfo(‘name’); 
?></a>. All Rights Reserved</p>
</footer>
<?php wp_footer(); ?>
</body>
</html>
	
7.	Create the stylesheet file with the code in Listing 11-5 and then save it 
with the filename style.css.
	
	I cover CSS in more detail in Chapter 14 — this example gives you just 
some very basic styling to create your sample theme.
Listing 11-5:  style.css

Creating the Main Index template and activating the theme
Using the tags provided earlier in Table 11-3, along with the information 
on The Loop and the calls to the Header, Sidebar, and Footer templates 
provided in earlier sections, you can follow the next steps for a bare-bones 
example of what the Main Index template looks like when you put the tags 
together.

197
 Chapter 11: Dissecting Themes and Templates
To create a Main Index template to work with the other templates in your 
WordPress theme, follow these steps:
	
1.	Open a new window in a text editor program, enter the code in Listing 
11-6, and save the file as index.php.
	
	I describe the lines in the index.php file in more detail immediately fol-
lowing this step list.
Listing 11-6:  index.php
<?php get_header(); ?>	
➝ 1
<?php if (have_posts()) : ?>	
➝ 2
<?php while (have_posts()) : the_post(); ?>	
➝ 3
<article <?php post_class() ?> id=”post-<?php the_ID(); ?>”>	
➝ 4
        <a href=”<?php the_permalink(); ?>”><?php the_title(); ?></a>	
➝ 5
        Posted on: <?php echo get_the_date(); ?> at <?php echo get_the_time(); 
?>	
➝ 6
        Posted in: <?php the_category(‘,’); ?>	
➝ 7
        <?php the_content(‘Read More..’); ?>	
➝ 8
        Posted by: <?php the_author(); ?> | <?php comments_popup_link(‘No 
Comments’, ‘1 Comment’, ‘% Comments’); ?>	
➝ 9
</article>	
	 	
➝ 10
<?php endwhile; ?>	
➝ 11
<?php next_posts_link(‘&laquo; Previous Entries’) ?>	
➝ 12
<?php previous_posts_link(‘Next Entries &raquo;’) ?>	
➝ 13
<?php else : ?>	
➝ 14
<p>Not Found</p>	
➝ 15
<p>Sorry, but you are looking for something that isn’t here.</p>	
<?php endif; ?> 	
➝ 17
</section>	
	
<?php get_sidebar(); ?>	
➝ 18
<?php get_footer(); ?>                                                    ➝ 19
	
2.	Activate the theme on the WordPress Dashboard and then view your 
site to see your handiwork in action.
Here’s a closer look at each of the lines in index.php in Listing 11-6:
	
➝ 1	
This template tag pulls the information in the Header template of 
your WordPress theme.
	
➝ 2	
This template tag is an if statement that asks, “Does this blog 
have posts?” If the answer is yes, it grabs the post content infor-
mation from your MySQL database and displays the posts in  
your site.

198
Part III: Working with WordPress Themes 
	
➝ 3	
This template tag starts The Loop.
	
➝ 4	
This tag helps you create some interesting styles in your template 
using CSS, so check out Chapter 14 to find out all about it.
	
➝ 5	
This tag tells your blog to display the title of a post that’s click-
able (or linked) to the URL of the post.
	
➝ 6	
This template tag displays the date and time when the post was 
made. With these template tags, the date and time format are 
determined by the format you set on the Dashboard.
	
➝ 7	
This template tag displays a comma-separated list of the catego-
ries to which you’ve assigned the post — Posted in: category 1, 
category 2, for example.
	
➝ 8	
This template tag displays the actual content of the post. The 
‘Read More..’ portion of this tag tells WordPress to display the 
words Read More, which are clickable (hyperlinked) to the post’s 
permalink, where the reader can read the rest of the post in its 
entirety. This tag applies when you’re displaying a post excerpt, 
as determined by the actual post configuration on the Dashboard.
	
➝ 9	
The template tag Posted by: <?php the_author(); ?> dis-
plays the author of the post in this manner: Posted by: Lisa Sabin-
Wilson. The template tag <?php comments_popup_link(‘No 
Comments’, ‘1 Comment’, ‘% Comments’); ?> displays 
the link to the comments for this post, along with the number of 
comments.
	
➝ 10	
This is the HTML markup that closes the <div> tag that was 
opened in Line 4.
	
➝ 11	
This template tag ends The Loop and tells WordPress to stop 
displaying blog posts here. WordPress knows exactly how many 
times The Loop needs to work, based on the setting on the 
WordPress Dashboard. That’s exactly how many times WordPress 
will execute The Loop.
	
➝ 12	
This template tag displays a clickable link to the previous page of 
posts, if any.
	
➝ 13	
This template tag displays a clickable link to the next page of 
posts, if any.
	
➝ 14	
This template tag refers to the if question asked in Line 2. If the 
answer to that question is no, this step provides the else state-
ment — IF this blog has posts, THEN list them here (Line 2 and 
Line 3), or ELSE display the following message.

199
 Chapter 11: Dissecting Themes and Templates
	
➝ 15	
This is the message followed by the template tag that appears 
after the else statement from Line 14. You can reword this state-
ment to have it say whatever you want.
	
➝ 17	
This template tag ends the if statement from Line 2.
	
➝ 18	
This template tag calls in the Sidebar template and pulls that 
information into the Main Index template.
	
➝ 19	
This template tag calls in the Footer template and pulls that 
information into the Main Index template. Note: The code in the 
footer.php template ends the <body> and the <html> tags that 
were started in the Header template (header.php).
This very simple Main Index template that you just built does not have 
the standard HTML markup in it, so the visual display of your site differs 
somewhat from the default Twenty Thirteen theme. This example gives you 
the bare-bones basics of the Main Index template and The Loop in action. 
Chapter 14 of this book goes into detail about the use of HTML and CSS to 
create nice styling and formatting for your posts and pages.
Using additional stylesheets
Often, a theme uses multiple stylesheets for browser compatibility or consis-
tent organization. If you use multiple stylesheets, the process for including 
them in the template is the same as any other stylesheet.
To add a new stylesheet, create a css directory in the root theme folder. 
Next, create a new mystyle.css file within the css folder. To include the 
file, you must edit the header.php file. The following example shows the 
code you need to include in the new CSS file.
<link rel=”stylesheet” href=”<?php bloginfo(‘stylesheet_directory’);
?>/css/mystyle.css” type=”text/css” media=”screen” />

Displaying Content with Widgets 
and Template Tags
In This Chapter
▶	Looking at the common template tags
▶	Adding new widget areas to a theme
▶	Creating templates to handle specific content display
▶	Adding theme support for specific features
T
 
his chapter gives you the lowdown on ways you can control how content 
appears on your site. When you create a WordPress theme, you use a 
combination of template tags to display certain types of content such as blog 
posts, navigation menus, page content, archive links, and so on. This chapter 
takes a look at common template tags that tell WordPress what information 
you want to show on your site.
As WordPress becomes more intuitive and user-friendly, I find that in several 
areas you don’t really need to use template tags or code to get the results 
you need; instead, you can add new widget areas to your theme, which 
enables you to use the drag-and-drop widget feature to include different 
types of content and/or navigation on your website. If your theme doesn’t 
have widget areas in all the places where you need them, this chapter shows 
you how to add new widget areas so that you can take full advantage of the 
ease of the widget interface.
WordPress also lets you create different templates that handle specific types 
of content such as categories, archives, search results, author pages, and more. 
This chapter explores the methods of creating content-specific templates to 
drive the content delivery and visual look of your site.
And, finally, you find out how to add some of the great tools in the WordPress 
core to your theme to give you more customization options, including popular 
built-in features such as custom navigation menus, post types, post formats, 
and post thumbnails or featured images.

202
Part III: Working with WordPress Themes 
Exploring Common Template Tags
In this section, I describe the template tags for the items commonly placed in 
the sidebar of a site. I say commonly placed because it’s possible to get cre-
ative with these template tags and place them in other locations, such as the 
Footer template. To keep this introduction to sidebar template tags simple, 
I stick with the most common use, leaving the creative and uncommon uses 
for you to try when you’re comfortable with the basics.
	
Most of the functions and sidebar template tags I cover in this chapter can 
be accomplished through widgets (see Chapter 10), without having to code 
them into the template at all. I present them to you in this chapter to make 
sure you understand and are comfortable with template tags and their asso-
ciated parameters.
This section also discusses the tag parameters that you can include in the tag 
to control some of its display properties. You need to know these three types 
of parameters:
	
✓	String: A line of text that can be anything from a single letter to a long 
list of words. A string is placed between single quotation marks and sets 
an option for the parameter or is displayed as text.
	
✓	Integer: A positive or negative number. Integers are placed within the 
parentheses and either inside or outside single quotation marks. Either 
way, they’re processed correctly.
	
✓	Boolean: Sets the parameter options to true or false. This parameter 
can be numeric (0 = false and 1 = true) or textual. Boolean param-
eters aren’t placed within quotation marks.
You place tag parameters inside the parentheses of the tag. Information in 
Chapter 11 helps you understand the three variations of parameters used in 
template tags. Keep in mind that not all template tags have parameters.
	
The WordPress Codex page at http://codex.wordpress.org has every 
conceivable template tag and possible parameter known to the WordPress 
software. The tags and parameters I share with you in this chapter are the 
ones used most often.
Calendar
The calendar template tag displays a calendar that highlights each day of the 
week on which you’ve created a blog post. Those days are also hyperlinked 
to the original blog post. Here’s the tag to use to display the calendar:

203
 Chapter 12: Displaying Content with Widgets and Template Tags
<?php get_calendar(); ?>
The get_calendar(); tag has only one parameter, and it’s Boolean. Set 
this parameter to true, and it displays the day of the week with one letter 
(Friday = F, for example). Set this parameter to false, and it displays the 
day of the week as a three-letter abbreviation (Friday = Fri., for example). 
Here are examples of the template tag used to display the calendar on your 
WordPress site:
<?php get_calendar(true); ?>
<?php get_calendar(false); ?>
List pages
The <?php wp_list_pages(); ?> tag displays a list of the static pages, 
such as About Me or Contact, that you can create on your WordPress site. 
Displaying links to the static pages allows readers to click the links and read 
the content you’ve provided.
WordPress has a handy Custom Menus feature that I cover in Chapter 10. 
If you like the navigation tool, you may never need to use the wp_list_
pages(); template tag. Still, I discuss this tag here because you may want 
to use it if you want complete control over how the list of pages appears on 
your website.
This tag uses the string style parameters. Table 12-1 lists the most common 
parameters used for the wp_list_pages(); template tag.

Parameter
Type
Description and Values
sort_
column
String
Sorts pages with one of the following options: 
‘post_title’ sorts alphabetically by page title 
(default).
‘menu_order’ sorts by page order (that is, the 
order in which pages appear in the Manage tab and 
Pages subtab of the Dashboard). 
‘post_date’ sorts by the date on which pages 
were created.
‘post_modified’ sorts by the time when the 
page was last modified. 
‘post_author’ sorts by author, according to the 
author ID #.
‘post_name’ sorts alphabetically by the post slug.
depth
Integer
Uses a numeric value for how many levels of pages 
appear in the list of pages. Possible options:
0 displays all pages, including main and subpages 
(default).
–1 shows subpages but doesn’t indent them in the list 
display.
1 shows only main pages, no subpages.
show_
date
String
Displays the date when the page was created or last 
modified. Possible options: 
‘ ‘ displays no date (default).
‘modified’ displays the date when the page was 
last modified.
‘created’ displays the date when the page was 
created.
date_
format
String
Sets the format of the date to be displayed. Defaults 
to the date format configured in the Options tab and 
General subtab of the Dashboard.
title_li
String
Types text for the heading of the page list. Defaults to 
display the text: “Pages”. If the value is empty (‘’), 
no heading appears; for example, ‘title_li=My 
Pages’ displays the heading My Pages above the 
page list.

205
 Chapter 12: Displaying Content with Widgets and Template Tags
Page lists appear in an unordered list (or bulleted list). Whichever term you 
use, an unordered list is a list with a bullet point in front of every page link.
The following tag and query string displays a list of pages without the text 
heading Pages. In other words, this tag displays no title at the top of the 
page’s link list:
<?php wp_list_pages(‘title_li=’); ?>
The following tag and query string displays the list of pages sorted by the 
date when they were created; the date also appears along with the page 
name:
<?php wp_list_pages(‘sort_column=post_date&show_date=’created’); ?>
Take a look at the way query-string parameters are written:
‘parameter1=value&parameter2=value&parameter3=value’
	
The entire string is surrounded by single quotation marks, and there is no 
white space within the query string. Each parameter is joined to its value by 
the = character. When you use multiple parameters/values, separate them 
with the & character. You can think of the string like this: parameter1= 
valueANDparameter2=valueANDparameter3=value. Keep this conven-
tion in mind for the remaining template tags and parameters in this chapter.
Post archives
The <?php wp_get_archives(); ?> template tag displays the blog 
post archives in a number of ways, using the parameters and values shown 
in Table 12-2. Values that appear in bold are the default values set by 
WordPress. Here are just a few examples of what you can produce with this 
template tag:
	
✓	Display the titles of the last 15 posts you’ve made to your blog.
	
✓	Display the titles of the posts you’ve made in the past ten days.
	
✓	Display a monthly list of archives.

 Chapter 12: Displaying Content with Widgets and Template Tags
Here are a couple examples of tags used to display blog post archives.
This tag displays a linked list of monthly archives (for example, January 2011, 
February 2011, and so on):
<?php wp_get_archives(‘type=monthly’); ?>
This tag displays a linked list of the 15 most recent blog posts:
<?php wp_get_archives(‘type=postbypost&limit=15’); ?>
Categories
WordPress lets you create categories and assign posts to a specific category 
(or multiple categories). Categories provide an organized navigation system 
that helps you and your visitors find posts you’ve made on certain topics.
The <?php wp_list_categories(); ?> template tag lets you display a 
list of your categories by using the available parameters and values. Table 
12-3 shows some of the most popular parameters. Each category is linked to 
the appropriate category page that lists all the posts you’ve assigned to it. 
Again, the values that appear in bold are the default values set by WordPress.

Example
feed_image  
(string)
Provides the path/
filename for an 
image for the feed.
No default
<?php wp_ 
list_categories 
(‘feed_image=

Here are a couple of examples of tags used to display a list of your categories.
This example, with its parameters, displays a list of categories sorted by 
name without showing the number of posts made in each category; it also 
displays the RSS feed for each category title:
<?php wp_list_categories(‘orderby=name&show_count=0&feed=RSS’); ?>
This example, with its parameters, displays a list of categories sorted by 
name with the post count showing; it also shows the subcategories of every 
parent category:
<?php wp_list_categories(‘orderby=name&show_count=1&hierarchical=1’); ’>
Content types (WP_Query tag)
WordPress makes it possible to pull in very specific types of content on your 
website through the WP_Query(); template class. Place this template tag 
before The Loop (described in Chapter 11), and it lets you specify which 

210
Part III: Working with WordPress Themes 
category you want to pull information from. If you have a category called 
WordPress, and you want to display the last three posts from that category 
on your front page, in your blog sidebar, or somewhere else on your site, you 
can use this template tag.
Looking at some of the parameters
The WP_Query(); template class has several parameters that let you display 
different types of content such as posts in specific categories, content from 
specific pages/posts, or dates in your blog archives. Here’s an example of two 
parameters you can use with the WP_Query(); tag:
	
✓	posts_per_page=X: This parameter tells WordPress how many posts 
you want to display. If you want to display only three posts, for example, 
enter posts_per_page=3.
	
✓	category_name=X: This parameter tells WordPress that you want to 
pull posts from the category with this specific slug. If the category slug 
is books-i-read, for example, enter category_name=books-i-read.
	
	The parameter category_name is slightly misleading because you 
don’t use the category name, but rather the category slug, which is 
different, as I explain in the “Exploring content-specific standard tem-
plates” section, later in this chapter.
The WP_Query(); class lets you pass many variables and parameters; it’s 
not just limited to categories either. You can use it for pages, posts, tags, 
and more. Visit the WordPress Codex at http://codex.wordpress.org/
Class_Reference/WP_Query and read about this feature.
Adding the WP_Query(); tag
Choose which category you want to list posts from and locate the slug 
that belongs to the category. After you do that, you’re ready to add the 
WP_Query(); tag to your template. The category slug is usually the same as 
the category name, except in lowercase with words separated by dashes; for 
example, the Books category on my site has a books slug. To double-check, 
visit the Categories page on your Dashboard by choosing Posts➪Categories, 
click the name of the category you want to use, and find the category slug 
listed. The line of code to display five posts from the Books category looks 
like this:
<?php $the_query = new WP_Query(‘posts_per_page=5&category_name=books;); ?>
It’s not enough just to add that one line of code, however; you need to use 
the WP_Query(); class within The Loop in WordPress (see Chapter 11 to 

211
 Chapter 12: Displaying Content with Widgets and Template Tags
review the WordPress Loop). Follow these steps to include a WP_Query 
within The Loop in your template:
	
1.	On your Dashboard, choose Appearance➪Editor.
	
	 The Edit Themes page opens.
	
2.	In the Templates list on the right side of the page, click the template 
in which you want to display the content.
	
	 For example, if you want to display content in a sidebar, choose the 
Sidebar template: sidebar.php.
	
	 The template you select appears in the editor in the middle of the page.
	
3.	Locate the first closing </ul> or </div> tag in the Sidebar template 
for the theme you’re using.
	
	 If you’re using the Twenty Thirteen theme, for example, the ending  
</div> looks like this: </div><!-- .widget-area -->
	
4.	Type the following code directly above the ending </div> tag:
<?php $the_query = WP_Query(‘posts_per_page=5&category_name=books;); ?>
<?php while ($the_query->have_posts()) : $the_query->the_post(); ?>
<strong><a href=”<?php the_permalink() ?>” rel=”bookmark” title=”Permanent 
Link to
<?php the_title_attribute(); ?>”><?php the_title(); ?></a></strong>
<?php the_excerpt(); endwhile; ?>
	
	 In the first line, I indicate the following: posts_per_page=5& 
category_name=books. You can change these numbers to suit your 
specific needs. Just change 5 to whatever number of posts you want to 
appear (there’s no limit!), and change books to the specific category 
slug that you want to use.
	
5.	Click the Update File button to save the changes to your template.
Miscellaneous but useful template tags
In this chapter, I’ve picked the most common template tags to get you 
started. You can find the rest of the template tags in the WordPress Codex at 
http://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags.
A few miscellaneous tags aren’t included in the preceding sections, but I want 
to mention them here briefly because they’re helpful and sometimes fun. 
Table 12-4 lists some of these tags, their locations in the templates where 
they’re commonly used, and their purposes.

 Chapter 12: Displaying Content with Widgets and Template Tags
Adding New Widget Areas to Your Theme
About 99.99 percent of the WordPress themes available are coded with 
widgetized sidebars. This coding means that you can use the widgets within 
WordPress to populate your sidebar area with content, navigation menus, 
and lists. In Chapter 10, I go into detail about what widgets are and how you 
can use them to dress up your sidebar — so check out that chapter if you 
need more information about widgets.
With widgets in place, generally you don’t need to mess around with the code 
in the sidebar.php template file because most of the content you want to 
add to your sidebar can be accomplished with widgets.
In the following sections, you discover how to register new widget areas and 
then add those widget areas to your template file so you can use WordPress 
widgets on your site.
Registering your widget areas
In a WordPress theme, you can create widget areas to use literally anywhere 
within your theme. The sidebar is the most common place widgets are used, 
but many people also use widgets in the footer, header, and main content 
areas of their websites. Sidebars and widgets can appear anywhere you want 
them to. For this example, I use the Sidebar template (sidebar.php).
First, you have to define the sidebar in your theme. Therefore, you need to alert 
WordPress that this theme can handle widgets, also referred to as registering  
a widget with the WordPress software. To register a widget, you need to  
add the register_sidebar function to the Theme Functions template 
(functions.php). In the functions.php file in the Twenty Thirteen  
theme (choose Appearance➪Editor and then click the theme functions 
[functions.php] file), the code for registering a widget looks like this:
register_sidebar( array (
‘name’ => __( ’Primary Widget Area’),
‘id’ => ‘widget-name’,
‘description’ => __( ‘The primary widget area’),
‘before_widget’ => ‘<li id=”%1$s” class=”widget-container %2$s”>’,
‘after_widget’ => “</li>”,
‘before_title’ => ‘<h3 class=”widget-title”>’,
‘after_title’ => ‘</h3>’,
) ); 
This code contains seven arrays. An array is a set of values similar to a 
query string that tells a function what variables to use. In this case, it tells 
WordPress how you want your sidebar and its widgets handled and displayed:

214
Part III: Working with WordPress Themes 
	
✓	name: This name is unique to the widget and appears on the Widgets 
page on the Dashboard; this name is helpful if you register several  
widgetized areas on your site.
	
✓	id: This is the unique ID given to the widget.
	
✓	description: This is a text description of the widget. The text appears 
on the Widgets page on the Dashboard.
	
✓	before_widget: This is the HTML markup that gets inserted directly 
before the widget; it’s helpful for Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) styling 
purposes.
	
✓	after_widget: This is the HTML markup that gets inserted directly 
after the widget.
	
✓	before_title: This is the HTML markup that gets inserted directly 
before the widget title.
	
✓	after_title: This is the HTML markup that gets inserted directly after 
the widget title.
The preceding code snippet registers a widget — Primary Widget Area — on 
the WordPress Dashboard. Additionally, the code places the sidebar’s con-
tent in an element that has the CSS widget class (and is styled as an unor-
dered list) and puts <h3> tags around the widget’s title. You can insert this 
code directly below the first opening PHP tag (<?php). (See Chapter 14 for 
more on CSS and HTML.)
	
Pressing Enter to add a few extra lines when you enter code can be helpful. 
The browser ignores the extra empty lines around your code, but they can 
greatly increase readability.
With that code in your theme functions (functions.php) file, WordPress 
recognizes that you’ve registered a widget area for your theme and makes 
the widget area available for you to drag and drop widgets into from the 
Widgets page on the Dashboard. All that’s left to do now is to call that widget 
into your sidebar.php file, as described next. By doing so, you allow the 
widgets to appear on your site.
Adding widget areas to your template files
Follow these steps to call widgets to your site (these steps assume the widget 
code isn’t already in the Sidebar template):
	
1.	On your Dashboard, choose Appearance➪Editor.
	
	 The Edit Themes page opens.
	
2.	Click the Sidebar (sidebar.php) template in the list on the right side 
of the page.
	
	 The Sidebar template opens in the text box in the middle of the page.

215
 Chapter 12: Displaying Content with Widgets and Template Tags
	
3.	Type the following code in the Sidebar (sidebar.php) template:
<ul id=”sidebar”>
<?php if ( ! dynamic_sidebar( ‘Primary Widget Area’ ) ) : ?>
<?php endif; ?>
</ul>
	
	 The parameter within the dynamic_sidebar template tag corresponds 
to the name that you provided in the ‘name’ widget array earlier in this 
section. For this example, I used ‘Primary Widget Area’. The name 
you use must be the same one that you used earlier; otherwise, it won’t 
appear on your website.
	
4.	Click the Update File button.
	
	 The changes you’ve made to the Sidebar (sidebar.php) template file 
are saved.
	
You can register an unlimited number of widgets for your theme. This flexibility 
allows you to create several widgetized areas and widget features in different 
areas of your site.
Using Template Files
In Chapter 11, I introduce the concept of template files and give you an over-
view of the basic template files that make up a standard WordPress theme: 
index.php, header.php, footer.php, sidebar.php, and style.css. 
The WordPress theme engine is flexible and gives you several ways of using 
templates and tags to pull different types of content from your database to 
appear on your website.
In Chapter 11, you find out how to create a very simple theme using the stan-
dard templates. In the following sections, I discuss the options to extend the 
standard functionality of WordPress so that you have the flexibility to quickly 
address specific needs for your website.
Creating named templates
WordPress recognizes three special areas of a theme: header, footer, and 
sidebar. The get_header, get_footer, and get_sidebar functions default 
to loading header.php, footer.php, and sidebar.php, respectively. Each 
of these functions also supports a name parameter that allows you to load an 
alternative version of the file. For example, running get_header(‘main’) 
causes WordPress to load header-main.php.
You may wonder why you’d use the name parameter when you can just create 
a template file named whatever you like and load it directly. The following are 
reasons for using the get_header, get_footer, or get_sidebar functions 
with a name parameter:

216
Part III: Working with WordPress Themes 
	
✓	You use a standard naming convention that users can easily recognize 
and understand.
	
✓	You can load specialized template files easily and quickly.
	
✓	You offer a fallback that loads the unnamed template file if the named  
one doesn’t exist. For example, if you use the tag get_header(‘main’); 
in your template, but for some reason the header-main.php template 
file does not exist, WordPress defaults to header.php, which saves the 
integrity of your website display until you can load the header-main.
php file correctly.
	
In short, use the name parameter feature if you have multiple, specialized 
Header, Footer, or Sidebar template files.
Creating and using template parts
Template parts are relatively new (they were added in version 3.0 in June 
2010). A template part is very similar to the Header, Footer, and Sidebar tem-
plates except that you aren’t limited to just these. You can branch out and 
create any number of template parts to call into your WordPress theme to 
provide specific functions, such as displaying posts from a specific category 
or displaying a gallery of photos you’ve uploaded to your website.
The get_header, get_footer, and get_sidebar functions allow for code 
that was once duplicated in many of the template files to be placed in a single 
file and loaded using a standard process. The purpose of template parts is to 
offer a new standardized function that can be used to load sections of code 
specific to an individual theme. Using the concept of template parts, sections 
of code that add a specialized section of header widgets or display a block of 
ads can be placed in individual files and easily loaded as a template part.
Template parts are loaded via the get_template_part function. The get_
template_part function accepts two parameters:
	
✓	Slug: The slug parameter is required and describes the generic type of 
template part to be loaded, such as content.
	
✓	Name: The name parameter is optional and selects a specialized tem-
plate part, such as post.
A call to get_template_part with just the slug parameter tries to load a 
template file with the slug.php filename. Thus, a call to get_template_
part(‘content’) tries to load content.php. And a call to get_template_
part(‘header’ ,‘widgets’) tries to load header-widgets.php. See 
a pattern here? When I refer to a slug, I mean the name of the template file, 
minus the .php extension, because WordPress already assumes that it’s a 
PHP file.

217
 Chapter 12: Displaying Content with Widgets and Template Tags
A call to get_template_part with both the slug and name parameters tries 
to load a template file with a slug-name.php filename. If a template file with 
a slug-name.php filename doesn’t exist, WordPress tries to load a template  
file with a slug.php filename. Thus, a call to get_template_part 
(‘content’, ‘post’) first tries to load content-post.php followed  
by content.php if content-post.php doesn’t exist. A call to get_
template_part(‘header-widgets’, ‘post’) first tries to load 
header-widgets-post.php followed by header-widgets.php if 
header-widgets-post.php doesn’t exist.
The Twenty Thirteen theme offers a good example of the template part fea-
ture in use; it uses a loop template part to allow The Loop to be pulled into 
individual template files.
	
The Loop is the section of code found in most theme template files that uses 
a PHP while loop to literally loop through the set of content (such as post, 
page, archive, and so on) and then display it. The presence of The Loop in 
a template file is crucial for a theme to function properly. Chapter 11 has a 
more detailed examination of The Loop.
Twenty Thirteen’s index.php template file shows a template part for The 
Loop in action in line 7 of the following code using the get_template_
part(); template tag:
<?php get_header(); ?>
<div id=”primary” class=”content-area”>
<div id=”content” class=”site-content” role=”main”>
<?php if ( have_posts() ) : ?>
<?php /* The loop */ ?>
<?php while ( have_posts() ) : the_post(); ?>
<?php get_template_part( ‘content’, get_post_format() ); ?>
<?php endwhile; ?>
<?php twentythirteen_paging_nav(); ?>
<?php else : ?>
<?php get_template_part( ‘content’, ‘none’ ); ?>
<?php endif; ?>
</div><!-- #content -->
</div><!-- #primary -->
<?php get_sidebar(); ?>
<?php get_footer(); ?>
Loading The Loop by using a template part, Twenty Thirteen cleans up the 
index.php code considerably when compared with other themes. This 
cleanup of the template file code is just the icing on the cake. The true ben-
efits are the improvements to theme development.
Twenty Thirteen’s index.php template file calls for a template part with 
a slug of content and the get_post_format(); tag. The get_post_
format(); refers to post formats that are in use in the theme. Post formats 

218
Part III: Working with WordPress Themes 
are covered later in this chapter in the “Adding support for post formats” 
section, which refers to different types of post formats such as audio, video, 
and image. If you look at the other template files in Twenty Thirteen, you’ll 
see files with the content slug:
	
✓	content-aside.php
	
✓	content-audio.php
	
✓	content-chat.php
	
✓	content-gallery.php
	
✓	content-image.php
	
✓	content-link.php
	
✓	content-none.php
	
✓	content-quote.php
	
✓	content-status.php
	
✓	content-video.php
	
✓	content.php
The get_post_format(); tag within the get_template_part(); auto-
matically picks up the type of post format defined for the post and uses the 
corresponding template file. For example, if the post format is image, the 
content-image.php is used. Alternatively, if no post format is defined, 
WordPress simply uses content.php.
Before template parts, the full Loop code, which can have up to ten lines of 
code (or more), would be duplicated in each of the template files, over and 
over. This means that a modification to the index.php file’s Loop code 
would also require the same modification to the single.php file. Imagine 
if you had to make the same modification to five template files; repeatedly 
making the same modifications would quickly become tiring, and each modi-
fication would increase your chance of making mistakes. Using a template 
part means that the modifications to The Loop need to be made only once, 
so it’s applied to all templates using The Loop code via the get_template_
part(); function, cutting down your overall development time.
The get_template_part call allows for easily creating as many customized 
templates as needed without having to duplicate the multiple lines of The 
Loop code over and over again. Without the duplicate code, the code for The 
Loop can be easily modified in one place.
	
When you duplicate sections of code in numerous template files, place the 
code in a separate file and use the get_template_part function to load it 
where needed.

219
 Chapter 12: Displaying Content with Widgets and Template Tags
Exploring content-specific standard templates
The template files discussed so far in this book span a wide scope of site views 
specific to the view, not the content. For example, the category.php template 
file applies to all category archive views but not to a specific category, and the 
page.php template file applies to all page views but not to a specific page. 
However, you can create template files for specific content and not just the view.
Four content-specific template types are available: author, category, page, 
and tag. Each allows you to refer to specific content by the term’s ID (an indi-
vidual author’s ID, for instance) or by the slug.
	
The slug I discuss in this section differs from the slug parameter of the 
get_template_part function described in the preceding section. For this 
section, slug refers to a post, page, category, or so on — for example, a Press 
Releases category having a press-releases slug or a Hello World post with 
a hello-world slug.
Imagine that you have an About Us page with a 138 id and an about-us slug. 
You can create a template for this specific page by creating either a page-138.
php or a page-about-us.php file. In the same way, if you want to create a 
template specific to an awesome author named Lisa with a 7 id and a lisa 
slug, you can create an author-7.php or an author-lisa.php file.
Creating a template using the slug can be extremely helpful for sites that you 
don’t manage. If you want to share a theme that you created, you can create 
a category-featured.php template. This template would automatically 
apply to any category view that has a featured slug.
Using categories as the example, the file-naming conventions are as follows:
	
✓	A template with the filename category.php is a catch-all (default) 
for the display for all categories. (Alternatively, a template with the 
archives.php filename is used to display categories if a category.
php file does not exist.)
	
✓	You can add a dash and the category ID number to the end of the filename, 
as shown in Table 12-5, to specify a template for an individual category.
	
	Alternatively, you can add a dash and the category slug to the end of the 
filename, as shown in Table 12-5, to define it as a template for that particu-
lar category. For example, if you have a Books category, the category slug 
is books; the individual category template file is category-books.php.
	
✓	If you don’t have a category.php, an archives.php, or a category-#.
php file, the category display pulls from the Main Index template  
(index.php).
Table 12-5 gives you some examples of file-naming conventions for category 
templates, specifically.

Table 12-5	
Category Template File-Naming Conventions
If the Category ID or Slug Is . . .

category-1.php
2
category-2.php
3
category-3.php
books 
category-books.php
movies
category-movies.php
music 
category-music.php
	
Because creating a template using slugs is so useful (and because an id is 
relevant to only a specific site), you may wonder why the id option exists. 
The short answer is that the id option existed before the slug option; how-
ever, it is still valuable in specific instances. You can use the id option for a 
content-specific template without worrying about the customization break-
ing when the slug changes. This is especially helpful if you set up the site for 
someone and can’t trust that he’ll leave the slugs alone (such as a category 
with a news slug changing to press-releases).
Using Page templates
Although the page-slug.php feature is very helpful, sometimes requiring 
the theme’s user to use the name you chose for a feature is too difficult or 
unnecessary. Page templates allow you to create a stand-alone template (just 
like page.php or single.php) that users can use on any specific page they 
choose. As opposed to the page-slug.php feature, a Page template can be 
used on more than one page. The combined features of user selection and 
multiple uses make Page templates a much more powerful theme tool than 
page-slug.php templates.
To make a template a Page template, simply add Template Name: 
Descriptive Name to a comment section at the top of the template file. For 
example, this is the beginning of a onecolumn-page.php Page template:
<?php
/**
 * Template Name: One column, no sidebar
 *
 * A custom Page template without sidebar.
 *
 * The “Template Name:” bit above allows this to be selectable
 * from a dropdown menu on the edit page screen.
 *
 * @package WordPress
 * @subpackage Twenty_Thirteen
 * @since Twenty Thirteen 1.0
 */

 Chapter 12: Displaying Content with Widgets and Template Tags
This code registers the template file with WordPress as a Page template and 
adds One Column, No Sidebar to the Template drop-down list found under Page 
Attributes in the Add New Page (or Edit Page) screen, as shown in Figure 12-1. 
Using a template on a static page is a two-step process: Upload the template 
and then tell WordPress to assign the template by tweaking the page’s code.
Figure 12-1: The Add New Page screen on the Dashboard showing page attributes for  
template assignment.
The preceding code sample demonstrates how the WordPress developers 
created the One Column, No Sidebar Page template in the Twenty Thirteen 
theme; however, in reality, you need only three lines to make it happen. Here 
is the code that appears at the top of the static-page template I use for my 
About page at http://webdevstudios.com/about:
<?php
/*
Template Name: About Page
*/
?>
The important part is defining the Template Name between the starting and 
ending PHP function calls. This tells WordPress to recognize this as a unique 
template and then include it in the list of available templates within the Page  
Attributes on the Add New Page screen, as shown in Figure 12-1 (it also 
appears on the Add New Page page).

Part III: Working with WordPress Themes 
By providing a robust set of Page templates, you can offer your theme users 
easy-to-use options for formatting different pages within their websites.
Adding Theme Support for Built-In Features
The WordPress core offers a number of great tools that you can easily add to 
a theme to give it more customization options. WordPress provides you with 
several built-in features that let you enhance your site and theme. This sec-
tion covers four of the most popular features:
	
✓	Custom navigation menus
	
✓	Custom post types
	
✓	Post formats
	
✓	Post thumbnails (or featured images)
These features are part of the WordPress core; however, they aren’t acti-
vated by default. By adding theme support, I really mean that you’re activating 
a built-in feature in your theme. When you’re traveling around the WordPress 
community — whether on a support forum or at a WordCamp event — 
and hear folks say, “That theme supports a certain feature,” you can smile 
because you know exactly what they’re talking about.
You need to activate support for these features in the theme you’re using:
	
✓	Core function: Add support for the feature in your theme by including the 
core function in the theme functions (functions.php) file in your theme.
	
✓	Template function: Add the necessary function tags in your theme 
template(s) to display the features on your website.
	
✓	Templates: In some cases, you can create feature-specific templates to 
create additional enhancement to display and include on your site.
The following sections take you through each feature, in this order: First, add 
the core function to your theme; second, add the function tags to your tem-
plates; and last, if indicated, create a feature-specific template in your theme 
that handles added features.
Adding support for custom navigation menus
I think the WordPress menu-building feature is the single greatest tool 
WordPress offers to theme developers. Before this tool, each theme devel-
oper implemented his own menu solution, creating a huge number of themes 
that had little navigation customization that didn’t require coding and a small 
set of themes that had very different ways of handling navigation. Now creat-
ing complex, multilevel menus on your WordPress site takes just a few steps, 
as I outline in the upcoming sections.

223
 Chapter 12: Displaying Content with Widgets and Template Tags
Exploring the Custom Menus feature in Twenty Thirteen
The Twenty Thirteen theme already supports menus. Looking at Twenty 
Thirteen’s functions.php file, you can see that the following lines of code 
handle registering the theme’s menu:
// This theme uses wp_nav_menu() in one location.
               register_nav_menu( ‘primary’, __( ‘Navigation Menu’, 
‘twentythirteen’ ) );
This code registers a single navigation area with a primary theme location 
name and a Navigation Menu human-readable name. With the Twenty 
Thirteen theme active, choose Appearance➪Menus and then flip to Chapter 
10 for steps on how to create menus using the Custom Menus feature on your 
Dashboard.
Adding the Custom Menus feature to a theme
The Custom Menus feature is already built in to the default Twenty Thirteen 
theme, so you don’t have to worry about preparing your theme for it. However, 
if you’re using a different theme, or creating your own, follow these steps to 
add this functionality:
	
1.	On the Dashboard, choose Appearance➪Editor.
	
	 The Edit Themes page appears.
	
2.	Click the Theme Functions (functions.php) template.
	
	 The Theme Functions template opens in the text editor in the center of 
the Edit Themes page.
	
3.	Type the following function on a new line anywhere above the  
closing ?> in the Theme Functions template: 
// ADD MENU SUPPORT
add_theme_support( ‘nav-menus’ ); 
	
	 This template tag tells WordPress that your theme can use the Custom 
Menus feature.
	
4.	Click the Update File button to save the changes to the template.
	
	 A Menus link appears in the Appearance menu.
	
	 Next, you want to add the menus template tag to the Header template 
(header.php).
	
5.	On the Edit Themes page, open the Header template (header.php).
	
	 The Header template opens in the text editor in the middle of the Edit 
Themes page.
	
6.	Add the following template tag by typing it on a new line anywhere in 
the Header template (header.php): 

224
Part III: Working with WordPress Themes 
<?php wp_nav_menu(); ?>
	
	 This template tag is needed so that the menu you build using the 
Custom Menus feature appears at the top of your website. Table 12-6 
gives the details on the different parameters you can use with the wp_
nav_menu(); template tag to customize the display to suit your needs.
	
7.	Click the Update File button to save the changes you’ve made to the 
Header template.
	
	 The navigation menu that you build on the Menus page on your 
Dashboard (choose Appearance➪Menus) now appears in the header 
area of your website.

Part III: Working with WordPress Themes 
I created a Main menu on the WordPress Dashboard. (See Chapter 10 for 
steps to create new and multiple menus on the WordPress Dashboard.) The 
template tag used in the theme to display that menu looks like this:
<?php wp_nav_menu(‘Main’); ?>
The HTML markup for the menu is generated as an unordered list, by default, 
and looks like this:
<ul id=”menu-main” class=”menu”>
<li id=”menu-item-53” class=”menu-item menu-item-type-custom menu-item-object-
custom menu-item-53”><a href=”/”>Home</a></li> 
<li id=”menu-item-51” class=”menu-item menu-item-type-post_type menu-item-
object-page menu-item-51”><a href=”http://localhost/wpdemo/
blog/”>Blog</a></li> 
<li id=”menu-item-52” class=”menu-item menu-item-type-post_type menu-item-
object-page menu-item-52”><a href=”http://localhost/wpdemo/
about/”>About</a></li> 
</ul>
Notice in the HTML markup that the first line defines the CSS ID and class: 
<ul id=”menu-main” class=”menu”>
The ID in that line reflects the name that you gave your menu. Because I gave 
my menu the name Main when I created it on the Dashboard, the CSS ID is 
‘menu-main’. If I had named the menu Foo, the ID would be ‘menu-foo’. 
This assignment of menu names in the CSS and HTML markup allows you to 
use CSS to create different styles and formats for your menus.
When developing themes for yourself or others, make sure that the CSS 
you define for the menus accounts for subpages by creating drop-down list 
effects, or links that drop down from the menu when you hover your mouse 
pointer over the main parent link. You can accomplish this in several ways, 
and Listing 12-1 gives you one example of a block of CSS that you can use to 
create a nice style for your menu.
Listing 12-1:  Sample CSS for Drop-Down List Navigation
#menu-main {
    width: 960px;
    font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, Trebuchet MS;

The CSS you use to customize the display of your menus differs; the example 
that I provide in Listing 12-1 is just that — an example. After you get the hang 
of using CSS, you can try different methods, colors, and styling to create a 
custom look of your own. You can find additional information about basic 
HTML and CSS in Chapter 14.
Displaying custom menus using widgets
You don’t have to use the wp_nav_menu(); template tag to display the 
menus on your site because WordPress also provides you with a Custom 
Menu widget that you can add to your theme, allowing you to use widgets, 
instead of template tags, to display the navigation menus on your site. This 
is especially helpful if you’ve created multiple menus for use in and around 
your site in various places. (See Chapter 10 for more information on using 
WordPress widgets.)
Your first step is to register a special widget area for your theme to handle 
the Custom Menu widget display. To do this, open your theme’s function.
php file and add the following lines of code anywhere before the closing ?>:
// ADD MENU WIDGET
if ( function_exists(‘register_sidebars’) )
                register_sidebar(array(‘name’=>’Menu’,));
These few lines of code create a new Menu Widget Area on the Widgets page 
on your Dashboard. At this point, you can drag the Custom Menu widget into 
the Menu Widget Area to indicate that you wish to display a custom menu 
in that area. If you have more than one menu, you can select which menu to 

229
 Chapter 12: Displaying Content with Widgets and Template Tags
display from the Select Menu drop-down list. The Menu Widget Area with the 
Custom Menu widget added is shown in Figure 12-3.
To add the Menu Widget Area to your theme, head over to the Edit Themes 
page (choose Appearance➪Editor), click the Header template (header.php) 
file, and add these lines of code in the area you want the Menu Widget Area 
displayed:
<ul>
<?php if ( !function_exists(‘dynamic_sidebar’) || !dynamic_sidebar(‘Menu’) ) : 
?>
<?php endif; ?>
</ul>
These lines of code tell WordPress that you want information contained in 
the Menu Widget Area displayed on your site.

Part III: Working with WordPress Themes 
Adding support for custom post types
Custom post types and custom taxonomies have expanded the content man-
agement system (CMS) capabilities of WordPress and are likely to be a big 
part of plugin and theme features as more developers become familiar with 
their use. Custom post types allow developers to create new content types 
separate from posts and pages, such as movie reviews or recipes. Custom tax-
onomies allow developers to create new types of content groupings separate 
from categories and tags, such as genres for movie reviews or seasons for 
recipes (for example, fall, spring, or winter recipes).
Posts and pages are nice, generic containers of content. A page is timeless 
content that has a hierarchal structure because a page can have a parent 
(forming a nested, or hierarchal, structure of pages). A post is content listed 
in linear (not hierarchal) order based on when it was published and can be 
organized into categories and tags. What happens when you want a hybrid 
of these features? What if you want content that doesn’t appear in the post 
listings, doesn’t have either categories or tags, but displays the posting date? 
Custom post types satisfy this desire to customize content types.
By default, WordPress already has different post types built in to the soft-
ware, ready for you to use. These default post types include
	
✓	Blog posts
	
✓	Pages
	
✓	Menus
	
✓	Attachments
	
✓	Revisions
Custom post types let you create new and useful types of content on your 
website, including a smart and easy way to publish those content types to 
your site.
The possibilities for using custom post types are endless, but here are a few 
ideas that may help kick-start your imagination; these are also some of the 
more popular and useful ideas that others have implemented on sites:
	
✓	Photo galleries
	
✓	Podcasts or videos
	
✓	Book reviews
	
✓	Coupons and special offers
	
✓	Events calendars

231
 Chapter 12: Displaying Content with Widgets and Template Tags
Creating a custom post type
To create and use custom post types on your site, you need to be sure that 
your WordPress theme contains the correct code and functions. In the follow-
ing steps, you create a basic and generic custom post type called “Generic 
Content,” and later in this section, you find detailed information on the differ-
ent parameters you can use with custom post types to suit your needs:
	
1.	On your Dashboard, choose Appearance➪Editor.
	
	 The Edit Themes page opens.
	
2.	Click the Theme Functions template link to open the functions.php 
file.
	
	 The Theme Functions template opens in the text editor in the middle of 
the page.
	
3.	Add the custom post type code to the bottom of the Theme Functions 
template.
	
	 Scroll down to the bottom of the functions.php file and include the 
following code to add a Generic Content custom post type to your site:
// ADD CUSTOM POST TYPE
add_action( ‘init’, ‘create_post_type’ );
function create_post_type() {
 register_post_type( ‘generic-content’,
  array(
   ‘labels’ => array(
    ‘name’ => __( ‘Generic Content’ ),
    ‘singular_name’ => __( ‘Generic Content’ )
   ),
   ‘public’ => true
  )
 );
}
	
	 The function register_post_type(); can accept several arguments 
and parameters, which I detail in Table 12-7. You can use a variety and  
a combination of arguments and parameters to create a specific post 
type. You can find more information on custom post types and using  
the register_post_type(); function on the WordPress Codex  
page at http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/
register_post_type.
	
4.	Click the Update File button to save the changes made to the  
functions.php file.

If you don’t feel up to writing all this code in the Theme Functions file, the 
Custom Post Type UI plugin from WebDevStudios (http://webdevstudios.
com) provides you with an easy interface on your WordPress Dashboard. 
This plugin also simplifies the creation of custom post types on your site and 
bypasses the need to create the code in the theme functions (functions.
php) file. You can find the free plugin at http://wordpress.org/extend/
plugins/custom-post-type-ui.
After you complete the steps to add the Generic Content post type to your 
site, it’s added to the left navigation menu on the Dashboard, as shown in 
Figure 12-4.
New post type added
Figure 12-4: The Generic Content post type is added to the Dashboard.
You add and publish new content using the new custom post type just as 
you would when you write and publish blog posts. The published content 
isn’t added to the chronological listing of blog posts, but is instead treated as 
separate content, just like static pages.
View the permalink for the custom post type, and you see that it adopts the 
post type name, Generic Content, and uses it as part of the permalink struc-
ture. The permalink looks like http://yourdomain.com/generic- 
content/new-article.
Listing 12-2 gives you a real-life example that I used on the No Rules Theatre 
Company site I developed, which you can see at http://norulestheatre.
org. This site uses a Shows custom post type to create custom content for 
the shows that the theatre produces each season. Reference the parameters 
and information in the preceding Table 12-7 while you read through the lines 
of code in Listing 12-2 to see how the custom post types for the No Rules 
Theatre Company site were created and applied.

 Chapter 12: Displaying Content with Widgets and Template Tags
	
To add custom post types to the Menus options on the Menus page accessi-
ble from the Dashboard (choose Appearance➪Menus), click the Screen 
Options tab at the top right of that page. You see a check box next to Post 
Types that you can select to enable your custom post types in the menus you 
create. The Post Types appear in the Screen Options only if you have custom 
post types enabled in your theme.
Building a template for a custom post type
By default, custom post types use the single.php template in your theme — 
that is, unless you create a specific template for your custom post type. You 
may find the regular WordPress single.php template limiting for your post 
type. This depends on the type of content you want to include and whether 
you want to apply different formats and styles for your custom post type with 
HTML and CSS markup.
In the preceding section, I share the code to build a simple Generic Content 
custom post. After you add that, the Generic Content menu on the WordPress 
Dashboard appears (refer to Figure 12-4). Choose Generic Content➪Add New, 
and then publish a new post with some content for testing. For example, add 
a new Generic Content type with a Test title and a test slug. Because the 
Generic Content type doesn’t have a specific template yet, it uses the single.
php template, and resulting posts look no different from the standard.
	
If a Not Found page appears when you try to access a new custom post type 
entry, reset your permalink settings. Choose Settings➪Permalinks on the 
Dashboard and then click the Save Changes button. This forces WordPress to 
reset the permalinks for your site and add the new custom post type perma-
link formats. (See Chapter 4 for more on permalinks.)
To build a template specific for the Generic Content post type, add a new 
single-posttype.php template (posttype is the first argument passed to 
the register_post_type function from the preceding section). For this 
example, the template file specific to the Generic Content post type is single-
generic-content.php. Any modifications made to this template file are 
shown only for instances of the Generic Content post type.
Tying this together with the section “Creating and using template parts,” earlier 
in this chapter, a basic structure for single-generic-content.php for 
the Twenty Thirteen theme is
<?php get_header(); ?> 
<div id=”container”> 
  <div id=”content” role=”main”>
    <?php get_template_part(‘loop’, ‘generic-content’); ?>
  </div>
</div>
<?php get_sidebar(); ?>
<?php get_footer(); ?>

238
Part III: Working with WordPress Themes 
By using the template part, creating a loop-generic-content.php file 
allows for easy customization of The Loop for the Generic Content post type 
entry.
Adding support for post formats
Including the post formats in your theme allows you to designate a different  
content display and styling for certain types of designated posts. Unlike custom 
post types (which I describe earlier in this chapter), you can’t create different 
post formats because WordPress has already assigned them for you — it’s 
up to you which post format, if any, you want to use in your theme. You can, 
however, use one or all of them, depending on your needs.
Hopefully, this doesn’t sound too confusing. Here are examples of the post 
formats that are currently designated in WordPress:
	
✓	Aside: This format is a very short post to share a random thought or 
idea. Typically, an Aside is shared without a post title or category/tag 
designations. An Aside is simply a random, one-off thought shared on 
your blog, but is not a full post.
	
✓	Audio: The Audio post format is for sharing audio files, or podcasts. 
Usually, Audio posts have very little text included and instead include 
items, such as a built-in audio player, that visitors can click and listen to 
audio files from.
	
✓	Chat: This post format is a transcript of an online chat conversation that 
can be formatted to look just like a chat or instant messaging window.
	
✓	Gallery: This is a gallery of images in which you can click each image to 
access a larger version. Often these post formats don’t contain text and 
display only a gallery (but they may have a title).
	
✓	Image: This post format is used for displaying one image, such as in 
a photo blog. The image may, or may not, have text or a caption to go 
along with the post.
	
✓	Link: Use this to display a quick post that provides a link that you want 
to share with your readers. These post formats often contain a title and 
sometimes a short bit of text that describes the link you’re sharing.
	
✓	Quote: Display a quotation on your blog with this post format. Often, 
users include the quotation along with a byline for its source.
	
✓	Status: This provides a short status update, usually limited to 140 char-
acters or less (think Twitter!).
	
✓	Video: This format allows you to display a video, usually embedded 
within a handy video player (á la YouTube), so your readers can simply 
click to play the video without leaving your site.
	
✓	Standard: This displays your blog posts in the default manner, meaning 
it’s just an ordinary blog post without special formats applied to it.

239
 Chapter 12: Displaying Content with Widgets and Template Tags
You can find a good, real-world example of post formats on my website at 
http://lisasabin-wilson.com, as shown in Figure 12-5. My site sepa-
rates the formats I’ve chosen through the use of individual post styling to 
designate the different formats. In Figure 12-5, you see that I use different 
colors for specific post formats; for example the quote format appears on my 
site in blue.
	
If your site needs a different type of post format than is currently available, 
consider adding it as a custom post type instead. (See the earlier sections for 
details.)
Figure 12-5: Post formats in use.
Adding post formats to a theme
To add support for post formats in your theme, you first need to add the 
function call to your Theme Functions (functions.php) template. After 
you follow these few steps, I show you the magic that occurs on the Add New 
Post page on your WordPress Dashboard. But first, follow the steps to add 
post formats support in your theme:
	
1.	From your Dashboard, choose Appearance➪Editor.
	
2.	Click the theme functions (functions.php) file in the Templates list 
on the right to open it.

240
Part III: Working with WordPress Themes 
	
3.	In the text editor box, add the following function on a new line prior 
to the closing ?> tag:
add_theme_support( ‘post-formats’, array( ‘aside’, ‘chat’, ‘gallery’, 
‘image’, ‘link’, ‘quote’, ‘status’, ‘video’, ‘audio’ ) );
	
	 The preceding code sample adds all nine of the available post formats 
to the theme. You don’t have to use all nine; you can simply include only 
those formats that you think you’ll use in your theme and leave out the rest.
	
4.	Click the Update File button to save the changes made to the  
functions.php file.
You won’t notice an immediate change to your site when you save your 
new theme functions file with the post formats support added. To see what 
WordPress has added to your site, visit the Add New Post page by choosing 
Posts➪Add New on the Dashboard. Icons for each of the post formats appear 
across the top of the screen, as shown in Figure 12-6. Because I added all nine 
post format options, in the figure they’re all listed as available formats that 
I can select. You also see a tenth format option — Standard — which is the 
format used if you don’t select a specific format for your post.

 Chapter 12: Displaying Content with Widgets and Template Tags
Using template tags for post formats
Adding post format support to your theme isn’t enough. If you go through 
the hassle of adding post format support, you really should provide some 
unique styling for each type of format. If not, your different post formats will 
look just like the rest of your blog posts, and the point of adding them to your 
theme will be lost.
You can provide a unique display for your post formats in two ways:
	
✓	Content: For each format, you can designate what content you want to 
display. For example, if you don’t want to display a title for an Aside, 
leave out the template tag that calls it but leave in the template tag that 
calls the title for your Video post format.
	
✓	Style: Have a look at the nearby sidebar “Post class defined.” In the 
sidebar, I discuss using the HTML markup that’s provided by the post_
class(); tag. Your formats each have their own CSS class assigned to 
them. Use those CSS classes to provide unique styles for fonts, colors, 
backgrounds, and borders to your different post formats.
Post class defined
In the default Twenty Thirteen theme, look at 
the content.php template by clicking it  
on the Edit Themes page. About three-fourths 
of the way into that template is this line of code:
<article id=”post-<?php the_ID(); ?>” 
<?php post_class(); ?>>
The post_class(); section is the cool part 
of the template tag. This tag tells WordPress to 
insert specific HTML markup in your template. 
This HTML markup allows you to use CSS to 
make custom styles for sticky posts, categories, 
tags, and post formats.
For example, you can set the following options 
for a post:
	✓	Stick this post to the front page.
	✓	File in a category called WordPress.
	✓	Tag with News.
For the preceding example, WordPress inserts 
the following HTML markup:
<article class=”post sticky category-
wordpress tag-news”>
Likewise, for post formats, if you publish a 
post using the images post format, the post_
class() tag in the template contains the fol-
lowing HTML markup, indicating that this post 
should be formatted for an image display:
<article class=”post type-post format-
image”>
Combine this information with the CSS and 
HTML information in Chapter 14, and you see 
how you can use CSS along with the post_
class(); tag to provide custom styles for 
each of the post types, categories, and tags 
you’ve set up on your site.

242
Part III: Working with WordPress Themes 
Adding unique styles for your post formats starts with creating the content 
designations you wish to display for each format. Earlier in this chapter, I 
describe the nine possible post formats and give you some ideas on what 
you can do to display them on your site. The possibilities are endless, and 
it’s really up to you. See Chapter 11 for more information on the different 
content-related template tags you can use in these areas.
In the following steps, you create a simple, stripped-down Main Index (index.
php) file to use on your site and include post format support. This is just a 
sample template for you to follow and refer to when you create your custom 
display for your post formats. No time like the present; follow these steps:
	
1.	Open your favorite text editor, such as Notepad (Windows) or 
TextMate (Mac).
	
2.	Enter the code in Listing 12-3 to create a simple template for post formats.
	
	I describe the various lines of code following the listing.
	
3.	Save your file as index.php on your local computer.
	
4.	Upload the file into your theme folder (located in the /wp-content/
themes directory), replacing your existing index.php file.
	
	 See Chapter 5 for details on transferring files with FTP.

Listing 12-3 is a simple example and does not include a lot of HTML markup or 
CSS classes. I did that on purpose to focus on the code bits required to desig-
nate and define different content displays for your post formats. You can see 
in Listing 12-3 that some of the formats contain the template tag to display the 
title — the_title(); — and others do not. However, they all contain the 
template tag to display the content of the post: the_content();. As I mention 
earlier, you can play with different content types and markup that you want to 
add to your post formats.
Couple your template additions for post formats with the post_class();, 
which adds special CSS classes and markup for each post format type. You 

245
 Chapter 12: Displaying Content with Widgets and Template Tags
can really customize the display of each individual post format to your 
heart’s content.
Adding support for post thumbnails
Post thumbnails (or featured images) take a lot of the work out of associat-
ing an image with a post and using the correct size each time. A popular way 
to display content in WordPress themes includes a thumbnail image with a 
short snippet (or excerpt) of text — the thumbnail images are all the same 
size and placement within your theme.
Prior to the inclusion of post thumbnails in WordPress, users had to open 
their images in an image-editing program (such as Photoshop) and crop and 
resize them. Or users had to write fancy scripts that would resize images on 
the fly; however, these scripts tended to be resource-intensive on web serv-
ers, so they weren’t an optimal solution. How about a content management 
system that crops and resizes your images to the exact dimensions that you 
specify? Yep — WordPress does that for you, with just a few adjustments.
By default, when you upload an image in WordPress, it creates three versions 
of your image based on dimensions set on your Dashboard’s Media Settings 
page (choose Settings➪Media):
	
✓	Thumbnail size: Default dimensions are 150px x 150px.
	
✓	Medium size: Default dimensions are 300px x 300px.
	
✓	Large size: Default dimensions are 1024px x 1024px.
So, when you upload one image, you actually end up with four sizes of that 
same image stored on your web server: thumbnail, medium, large, and the 
original (full size) image you uploaded. Images are cropped and resized pro-
portionally, and typically when you use them in your posts, you can desig-
nate which size you want to use in the image options of the uploader (which I 
describe in Chapter 16). You can find the uploader on the Add New Post, Add 
New Page, and Add New Media pages on your WordPress Dashboard.
Within the WordPress image uploader, you can designate a particular image 
as the featured image of the post, and then, using the Featured Images func-
tion that you add to your theme, you can include some template tags to dis-
play your chosen featured image with your post. This is helpful for creating 
Magazine or News Style themes that are so popular with WordPress sites. 
Figure 12-7 displays my business website where we use post thumbnails and 
featured images to display a thumbnail associated with each post excerpt on 
the blog at http://webdevstudios.com.

246
Part III: Working with WordPress Themes 
Figure 12-7: Post thumbnails on WebDevStudios.com.
	
In the section “Adding custom image sizes for post thumbnails,” later in 
this chapter, I also cover adding support for different image sizes other 
than the default image sizes that are set on the Media Settings page on your 
Dashboard. This is helpful when you have sections of your site in which you 
want to display a much smaller thumbnail, or a larger version of the medium 
size but not as big as the large size.
Adding post thumbnails to a theme
To add support for post thumbnails, add one line of code to your theme func-
tions (functions.php) file anywhere before the closing ?>:
add_theme_support( ‘post-thumbnails’ );
After you add this line of code, you can use the featured image for your posts 
because it requires the Post Thumbnails function to be activated. You can 
then start designating images as featured using the built-in featured image 
found in the WordPress image uploader and on the Add New Post page, 
where you write and publish your posts.
After you start adding featured images to your posts, make sure you add the 
correct tag in your template(s) so the featured image appears on your site 
in the area you want it to. Open your index.php template, for example, and 

247
 Chapter 12: Displaying Content with Widgets and Template Tags
add the following line of code anywhere to include the default thumbnail-size 
version of your chosen featured image in your posts:
<?php if ( has_post_thumbnail() ) { the_post_thumbnail(‘thumbnail’); ?>
The first part of that line of code checks whether a featured image is associ-
ated with the post; if there is one, the image appears. If a featured image does 
not exist for the post, nothing returns. You can also include the other default 
image sizes — set in the Media Settings page on the Dashboard, as shown in 
Figure 12-8 — for medium, large, and full-sized images by using these tags:
<?php if ( has_post_thumbnail() ) { the_post_thumbnail(‘medium’); ?>
<?php if ( has_post_thumbnail() ) { the_post_thumbnail(‘large’); ?>
<?php if ( has_post_thumbnail() ) { the_post_thumbnail(‘full’); ?>
Figure 12-8: The Media Settings page on the Dashboard.
Adding custom image sizes for post thumbnails
If the predefined, default image sizes in WordPress (thumbnail, medium, 
large, and full) don’t satisfy you and you have an area on your site that 
you want to display images with dimensions that vary from the default, 
WordPress makes it relatively easy to add custom image sizes in your theme 
functions file. You then use the the_post_thumbnail function to display 
the featured image in your theme.
You aren’t limited on what sizes you can add for your images, and this exam-
ple shows you how to add a new image size of 600px x 300px. Add the follow-
ing line to your theme functions file (functions.php) below the previous 
function — add_theme_support(‘post-thumbnails’) — covered in the 
“Adding the post thumbnails to a theme” section, earlier in this chapter:
add_image_size(‘custom’, 600, 300, true);

248
Part III: Working with WordPress Themes 
This code tells WordPress that it needs to create an additional version of the 
images you upload and to crop and resize them to 600px in width and 300px 
in height. Notice the four parameters in the add_image_size function:
	
✓	Name ($name): Give the image size a unique name that you can use later 
in your template tag. In my example, I give the new image size the name 
‘custom’.
	
✓	Width ($width): Give the image size a width dimension in numbers. In 
my example, I define the width as 600.
	
✓	Height ($height): Give the image size a height dimension in numbers. 
In my example, I define the height as 300.
	
✓	Crop ($crop): This parameter is optional and tells WordPress whether 
it should crop the image to exact dimension, or do a soft proportional 
resizing of the image. In my example, I set this to true (the accepted 
arguments are true or false).
Adding the custom image size to your template to display the image you’ve 
designated as featured is the same as adding default image sizes, except the 
name of the image is set in the parentheses of the template tag. To add in my 
example custom image size, use the following tag:
<?php if ( has_post_thumbnail() ) { the_post_thumbnail(‘custom’); ?>

and Child Themes

U
 
sing a theme exactly as a theme author released it is great. If a new  
version is released that fixes a browser compatibility issue or adds  
features offered by a new version of WordPress, a quick theme upgrade is 
very easy to do.
However, there’s a good chance you’ll want to tinker with the design, add 
new features, or modify the theme structure. If you modify the theme, you 
can’t upgrade to a newly released version without modifying the theme again.
If only you could upgrade customized versions of themes with new features 
when they’re released. Fortunately, child themes give you this best-of-both-
worlds theme solution. This chapter explores what child themes are, how 
to create a child theme–ready parent theme, and how to get the most out of 
using child themes.
Customizing Theme Style with Child Themes
A WordPress theme consists of a collection of template files, stylesheets, 
images, and JavaScript files. The theme controls the layout and design that 
your visitors see on the site. When such a theme is properly set up as a 
parent theme, it allows a child theme, or a subset of instructions, to override 
its files. This ensures a child theme can selectively modify the layout, styling, 
and functionality of the parent theme.

250
Part III: Working with WordPress Themes 
The quickest way to understand child themes is by example. In this section, 
I show you how to create a simple child theme that modifies the style of the 
parent theme. Currently, the default WordPress theme is Twenty Thirteen 
(which I discuss in detail in Chapter 10). Figure 13-1 shows how the Twenty 
Thirteen theme appears on a sample site.
Figure 13-1: The Twenty Thirteen theme.
You likely have Twenty Thirteen on your WordPress site, and Twenty 
Thirteen is child theme–ready; therefore, it’s a great candidate for creat-
ing an example child theme. To keep the names simple, I call the new child 
theme TwentyThirteen Child (original, I know).
Creating a child theme
Like regular themes, a child theme needs to reside in a directory inside the  
/wp-content/themes directory. The first step to creating a child theme is 
to add the directory that will hold it. For this example, create a new twenty 
thirteen-child directory inside the /wp-content/themes directory.

251
 Chapter 13: Understanding Parent and Child Themes
To register the twentythirteen-child directory as a theme and to make 
it a child of the Twenty Thirteen theme, create a style.css file and add the 
appropriate theme headers. To do this, type the following code into your 
favorite code or plain text editor, such as Notepad (Windows) or TextMate 
(Mac), and save the file as style.css:
/*
Theme Name: TwentyThirteen Child
Description: My fabulous child theme
Author: Lisa Sabin-Wilson
Version: 1.0
Template: twentythirteen
*/
Typically, you find the following headers in a WordPress theme:
	
✓	Theme Name: The theme user sees this name in the back end of 
WordPress.
	
✓	Description: This header provides the user any additional information 
about the theme. Currently, this header appears only on the Manage 
Themes page (choose Appearance➪Themes).
	
✓	Author: This header lists one or more theme authors. Currently, 
this header is shown only on the Manage Themes page (choose 
Appearance➪Themes).
	
✓	Version: The version number is very useful for keeping track of outdated 
versions of the theme. Updating the version number when modifying a 
theme is always a good idea.
	
✓	Template: This header changes a theme into a child theme. The value 
of this header tells WordPress the directory name of the parent theme. 
Because your example child theme uses Twenty Thirteen as the parent, 
your style.css needs to have a Template header with a value of 
twentythirteen (the directory name of the Twenty Thirteen theme).
Activate the new TwentyThirteen Child theme as your active theme. (See 
Chapter 9 for details on how to activate a theme.) You see a site layout  
similar to the one shown in Figure 13-2.
Figure 13-2 shows that the new theme doesn’t look quite right. The problem 
is the new child theme replaced the style.css file of the parent theme, 
yet the new child theme’s style.css file is empty. You could just copy and 
paste the contents of the parent theme’s style.css file, but that’d waste 
some of the potential of child themes. Instead, you want to tweak only those 
styles and/or features that you want to modify and leave the rest alone, as I 
describe in the next section.

Figure 13-2: The TwentyThirteen Child theme.
Loading a parent theme’s style
One of the great things about Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is how rules can 
override one another. If you list the same rule twice in your CSS, the rule that 
comes last takes precedence. (I describe CSS in more detail in Chapter 14.)
For example:
a {
color: blue;
}
a {
color: red;
}
This example is overly simple, but it shows what I’m talking about nicely. The 
first rule says that all links (a tags) should be blue, whereas the second one 
says that links should be red. Because CSS says that the last instruction takes 
precedence, the links will be red.
Using this feature of CSS, you can inherit all the styling of the parent theme 
and selectively modify it by overriding the rules of the parent theme. But how 
can you load the child theme’s style.css file so that it inherits the parent 
theme’s styling?

253
 Chapter 13: Understanding Parent and Child Themes
Fortunately, CSS has another great feature that helps you do this with ease. 
Just add one line to the TwentyThirteen Child theme’s style.css file at the 
end of the following listing:
/*
Theme Name: TwentyThirteen Child
Description: My fabulous child theme
Author: Lisa Sabin-Wilson
Version: 1.0
Template: twentythirteen
*/
@import url(‘../twentythirteen/style.css’);
A number of things are going on here, so let me break it down piece by piece:
	
✓	@import: This tells the browser to load another stylesheet. Using this 
allows you to pull in the parent stylesheet quickly and easily.
	
✓	url(‘...’): This indicates that the value is a location and not a 
normal value.
	
✓	(‘../twentythirteen/style.css’);: This is the location of the 
parent stylesheet. Notice the /twentythirteen directory name. This 
needs to be changed to match the Template: value in the header of  
the CSS so that the appropriate stylesheet is loaded.
After you refresh your site, you see that the child theme’s design and layout 
match the original Twenty Thirteen theme. The updated child theme now 
looks like Figure 13-1, shown earlier.
Customizing the parent theme’s styling
Your TwentyThirteen Child theme is set up to match the parent Twenty 
Thirteen theme. Now you can add new styling to the TwentyThirteen Child 
theme’s style.css file. A simple example of how customizing works is 
adding a style that converts all h1, h2, and h3 headings to uppercase.
/*
Theme Name: TwentyThirteen Child
Description: My fabulous child theme
Author: Lisa Sabin-Wilson
Version: 1.0
Template: twentythirteen
*/
@import url(‘../twentythirteen/style.css’);
h1, h2, h3 {
text-transform: uppercase;
}

254
Part III: Working with WordPress Themes 
Figure 13-3 shows how the child theme looks with the CSS style additions 
applied — getting better, isn’t it?
	
As you can see, with just a few lines in a style.css file, you can create a 
new child theme that adds specific customizations to an existing theme. Not 
only is it quick and easy to do, but you don’t have to modify anything in the 
parent theme to make it work. Therefore, when upgrades to the parent theme 
are available, you can upgrade the parent to get the additional features with-
out making your modifications again.
More complex customizations work the same way. Simply add the new rules 
after the import rule that adds the parent stylesheet.
Figure 13-3: The updated child theme with uppercase headings.
Using images in child theme designs
Many themes use images to add nice touches to the design. Typically, you 
add these images to the images directory inside the theme. Just as a parent 
theme may refer to images in its style.css file, your child themes can have 
their own images directory. The following are examples of how these images 
can be used.

255
 Chapter 13: Understanding Parent and Child Themes
Using a child theme image in a child theme stylesheet
Including a child theme image in a child theme stylesheet is common. To 
do so, simply add the new image to the child theme’s images directory and 
refer to it in the child theme’s style.css file. To get a feel for the mechanics 
of this process, follow these steps:
	
1.	Create an images directory inside the child theme’s directory  
/wp-content/themes/twentythirteen-child/images.
	
2.	Add an image to the directory.
	
	 For this example, I added the body-bg.png image, which is a simple 
white-and-tan striped image that I created in Photoshop.
	
3.	Add the necessary styling to the child theme’s style.css file, as follows:
/*
Theme Name: TwentyThirteen Child
Description: My fabulous child theme
Author: Lisa Sabin-Wilson
Version: 1.0
Template: twentythirteen
*/
@import url(‘../twentythirteen/style.css’);
body {
background: url(‘images/body-bg.png’) repeat-x;
}
With a quick refresh of the site, it now has a new background, as shown in 
Figure 13-4. You can see how the background changed from plain white to a 
white-and-tan striped image.
Using a parent theme image in a child theme stylesheet
Child theme images are acceptable for most purposes. Sometimes, however, 
you’re better off using images supplied by the parent theme. You could just 
copy the parent theme image folder, with all its images, to the child theme, 
but that’d prevent the child theme from matching the parent theme if the 
parent theme image ever changes, such as after an upgrade. Fortunately, you 
can refer to an image in the parent theme with the @import rule the same 
way you can reference the parent theme’s style.css file.
In the navigation menu area of the Twenty Thirteen design, a magnifying 
glass icon shown in Figure 13-5 appears on the right side that designates 
the search area — users click it to display the search form. This is a parent 
theme image.

256
Part III: Working with WordPress Themes 
Figure 13-4: The TwentyThirteen Child theme after editing the background image.
Figure 13-5: Magnifying glass in the TwentyThirteen navigation menu area.

257
 Chapter 13: Understanding Parent and Child Themes
In this example, you add the magnifying glass icon in front of the post title. 
Because the icon image already exists inside the parent theme, you can 
simply add a customization to the child theme’s style.css file to make this 
change, as follows:
/*
Theme Name: TwentyThirteen Child
Description: My fabulous child theme
Author: Lisa Sabin-Wilson
Version: 1.0
Template: twentythirteen
*/
@import url(‘../twentythirteen/style.css’);
.entry-title {
background: url(‘../twentythirteen/images/search-icon.png’) left center 
no-repeat;
padding-left: 30px;
}
Save the file and refresh your website to show the magnifying glass before 
the entry title. See Figure 13-6.
Using a child theme image in a parent theme stylesheet
In the earlier examples, you may wonder whether replacing an image used in 
the parent’s stylesheet with one found in the child theme’s directory is pos-
sible. Doing so would require a change to the parent theme’s stylesheet; the 
very idea behind a child theme is to avoid changes to the parent, so no, that 
isn’t possible. However, you can override the parent theme’s rule to refer 
to the child theme’s new image by simply creating an overriding rule in the 
child theme’s stylesheet that points to the new image.
In the preceding example, you place the magnifying glass icon to the left of 
the entry title. Take that a step further; the magnifying glass icon next to the 
entry title (refer to Figure 13-6) is small. You can do better with a larger icon. 
For this example, use a different magnifying glass icon that you can download 
from: http://lisasabin-wilson.com/magnifying-glass.jpg. Right-
click the image in your browser to save it to your local computer. (Be sure to 
remember where you saved it!)
After you add the desired image to your child theme’s images directory as 
magnifying-glass.jpg, the following style.css file replaces the mag-
nifying glass icon from the parent theme with the new one you just down-
loaded:

258
Part III: Working with WordPress Themes 
/*
Theme Name: TwentyThirteen Child
Description: My fabulous child theme
Author: Lisa Sabin-Wilson
Version: 1.0
Template: twentythirteen
*/
@import url(‘../twentythirteen/style.css’);
.entry-title {
background: url(images/magnifying-glass.jpg) left center no-repeat;
padding-left: 50px;
}
Figure 13-6: Showing the magnifying glass before the entry title.
Notice how some rules beyond just the background are modified to override 
parent theme styling that doesn’t work well with the new icon, like the addi-
tion of the padding-left: 50px — that is put in place to provide correct 
spacing for the magnifying glass. Now your child theme shows the new mag-
nifying glass to the left of the entry title. The new look, shown in Figure 13-7, 
is quite nice if you ask me.

259
 Chapter 13: Understanding Parent and Child Themes
Figure 13-7: The new magnifying glass icon.
	
You can’t directly replace parent theme images. Rather, you must provide a 
new image in the child theme and override the parent’s styling to refer to  
this new image.
Modifying Theme Structure with Child Themes
The preceding section shows how to use a child theme to modify the stylesheet 
of an existing theme. This is a tremendously powerful capability. A talented CSS 
developer can use this technique to create a variety of layouts and designs.
However, this is just the beginning of the power of child themes. Although 
every child theme overrides the parent theme’s style.css file, the child 
theme can override the parent theme’s template files, too. And child themes 
aren’t limited to just overriding template files; when needed, child themes 
can also supply their own template files.
Template files are PHP files that WordPress runs to render different views of 
the site. (See Chapter 11 for more on PHP.) A site view is the type of content 
being looked at in your web browser. Examples of different views are:

260
Part III: Working with WordPress Themes 
	
✓	Home: The home page of your website
	
✓	Category archive: A page that displays the archives within a particular 
category
	
✓	Individual post: A page that displays a single post from your blog
	
✓	Page content: A page that displays the content of a static page from 
your site
Some examples of common template files are index.php, archive.php, 
single.php, page.php, attachment.php, and search.php. (You can 
read more about available template files, including how to use them, in 
Chapter 11.)
You may wonder what purpose modifying template files of a parent theme 
serves. Although modifying the stylesheet of a parent theme can allow for 
some very powerful control over the design, it can’t add new content, modify 
the underlying site structure, or change how the theme functions. To get that 
level of control, you need to modify the template files.
Overriding parent template files
When both the child theme and parent theme supply the same template file, 
the child theme file is used. Overriding is the process of replacing the original 
parent template file.
Although overriding every single one of the theme’s template files can defeat 
the purpose of using a child theme — because if you’re going to rewrite every 
single template file to make it different from the parent theme, you may as well  
create an entirely new theme that does not depend on a parent theme — 
sometimes, producing a desired result makes tweaking one or two of the  
template files necessary.
The easiest way to customize a specific template file in a child theme is to 
copy the template file from the parent theme folder to the child theme folder. 
After you copy the file, you can customize it as needed, and the changes will 
reflect in the child theme.
A good example of a template file that can you can typically override is the 
footer.php file. Customizing the footer enables you to add site-specific 
branding.
Adding new template files
A child theme can override existing parent template files, but it can supply 
template files that don’t exist in the parent, too. Although you may never need 
your child themes to do this, this option can open possibilities for your designs.

261
 Chapter 13: Understanding Parent and Child Themes
For example, this technique proves most valuable with page templates. 
(Figure 13-8 shows the default page template in Twenty Thirteen.) The 
Twenty Thirteen theme does not have a One Column, No Sidebar page tem-
plate because with Twenty Thirteen, all you need to do is omit widgets from 
the Secondary Widget Area (see Chapter 12), and WordPress removes the 
right sidebar. But what if you’re using the Secondary Widget Area throughout 
your site and you want to omit the sidebar on just one page to display it full 
width? In a child theme, you can create a new page template, which still uses 
the styles and functions from the parent, but introduces a new layout in the 
child theme, in this case, a page template that omits the sidebar.
Figure 13-8: The default page template in Twenty Thirteen.
This isn’t a design flaw. The layout was intentionally set up this way to make 
it easy for users to include, or not include, a right sidebar on their sites. I 
like to use the right sidebar, but sometimes need to have a full-width layout 
option so that I can embed a video, add a forum, or add other content that 
works well with full width. To add this feature to your child theme, simply 
add a new page template and the necessary styling to the style.css file.

262
Part III: Working with WordPress Themes 
A good way to create a new theme page template is to copy an existing one 
and modify it as needed. In this case, copying the page.php file of the parent 
theme to a new page-full.php file is a good start. After a few customiza-
tions, the page-full.php file looks like this:
<?php
/**
 * Template Name: Full Width
 * The template for displaying full width.
 */
get_header(); ?>
<div id=”primary” class=”content-area”>
<div id=”content” class=”site-content” role=”main”>
<?php /* The loop */ ?>
<?php while ( have_posts() ) : the_post(); ?>
<article id=”post-<?php the_ID(); ?>” <?php post_class(); ?>>
<header class=”entry-header”>
<?php if ( has_post_thumbnail() && ! post_password_required() ) : ?>
<div class=”entry-thumbnail”>
<?php the_post_thumbnail(); ?>
</div>
<?php endif; ?>
<h1 class=”entry-title”><?php the_title(); ?></h1>
</header><!-- .entry-header -->
<div class=”entry-content”>
<?php the_content(); ?>
<?php wp_link_pages( array( ‘before’ => ‘<div class=”page-links”><span 
class=”page-links-title”>’ . __( ‘Pages:’, ‘twentythirteen’ ) . 
‘</span>’, ‘after’ => ‘</div>’, ‘link_before’ => ‘<span>’, ‘link_
after’ => ‘</span>’ ) ); ?>
</div><!-- .entry-content -->
<footer class=”entry-meta”>
<?php edit_post_link( __( ‘Edit’, ‘twentythirteen’ ), ‘<span class=”edit-
link”>’, ‘</span>’ ); ?>
</footer><!-- .entry-meta -->
</article><!-- #post -->
<?php comments_template(); ?>
<?php endwhile; ?>
</div><!-- #content -->
</div><!-- #primary -->
<?php get_footer(); ?>
The key modification here is the removal of the get_sidebar(); code, so 
the template does not call the sidebar widgets when this page template is 
assigned to a page on the site.

263
 Chapter 13: Understanding Parent and Child Themes
You need to make a small styling change in the child theme stylesheet to ensure 
the content of the full-width page spans the width of the site. By looking in the 
parent stylesheet, I can see that the content area width is defined by these lines:
.sidebar .entry-header,
.sidebar .entry-content,
.sidebar .entry-summary,
.sidebar .entry-meta {
  max-width: 1040px;
  padding: 0 376px 0 60px;
}
The padding in that style designates the right-side padding at 376px. You need 
to reduce the right side padding to allow for the content to extend farther to 
the right side of the browser window. Simply add the following lines after the  
@import rule in the child theme’s style.css file to reduce the right side  
padding to 60px (more information about CSS is found in Chapter 14):
.sidebar .entry-header,
.sidebar .entry-content,
.sidebar .entry-summary,
.sidebar .entry-meta {
  max-width: 1040px;
  padding: 0 60px 0 60px;
}
Switching to the Full Width page template produces the layout shown in 
Figure 13-9.
Removing template files
You may be wondering why you’d want to remove a parent’s template file. 
Unfortunately, the Twenty Thirteen theme doesn’t provide a good example of 
why you’d want to do this. Therefore, for future reference, you must use your 
imagination a bit here to understand the mechanics of removing a file from 
the parent theme.
Imagine that you’re creating a child theme built off an Example Parent parent 
theme. Example Parent is well designed, and the child theme looks and works 
exactly the way you want it to, but you have a problem.
The Example Parent theme has a home.php template file that provides a 
highly customized page template for use as the home page of your site. This 
works very well, but it isn’t what you want for the site if you want a standard 
blog home page. If the home.php file didn’t exist in Example Parent, every-
thing would work perfectly.

264
Part III: Working with WordPress Themes 
Figure 13-9: The Full Width, No Sidebar page template.
You can’t remove the home.php file from Example Parent without modifying  
the parent theme (which you never, ever want to do), so you have to use a 
trick. Instead of removing the file, override the home.php file and have it 
emulate index.php.
You may think that simply copying and pasting the Example Parent index.
php code into the child theme’s home.php file would be a good approach. 
Although this would work, I have a better way: You can tell WordPress to run 
the index.php file so that changes to index.php are respected. This single 
line of code inside the child theme’s home.php file is all you need to replace 
home.php with index.php:
<?php locate_template( array( ‘index.php’ ), true ); ?>
The locate_template function does a bit of magic. If the child theme sup-
plies an index.php file, it is used. If not, the parent index.php file is used.
This produces the same result that removing the parent theme’s home.php 
file would have. The home.php code is ignored, and the changes to index.
php are respected.

265
 Chapter 13: Understanding Parent and Child Themes
Modifying the theme functions file
Like template files, child themes can also provide a theme functions file, or a 
functions.php file. Unlike template files, the functions.php file of a child 
theme does not override the file of the parent theme.
When a parent theme and a child theme each have a functions.php file, 
WordPress runs both the parent and child functions.php files simulta-
neously. The child theme’s functions.php file runs first, and the parent 
theme’s functions.php file runs second. This is intentional because the 
child theme can replace functions defined in the parent theme’s functions.
php file.
However, this works only if the functions are set up to allow this.
The Twenty Thirteen functions.php file defines a twentythirteen_setup 
function. This function handles the configuration of many theme options and 
activates some additional features. Child themes can replace this function to 
change the default configuration and features of the theme, too.
The following lines of code summarize how the functions.php file allows 
this to happen:
function twentythirteen_setup()
Wrapping the function declaration in the if statement protects the site from 
breaking in the event of a code conflict and allows a child theme to define its 
own version of the function.
In the TwentyThirteen Child theme, you can see how modifying this func-
tion affects the theme. Add a new twentythirteen_setup function that 
adds post thumbnails support (see Chapter 12) to the TwentyThirteen Child 
theme’s functions.php file:
<?php
function twentythirteen_setup() {
add_theme_support( ‘post-thumbnails’ );
}
The result of this change is that the child theme no longer supports other 
special WordPress features, such as custom editor styling, automatic feed 
link generation, internationalization and location, and so on.
The takeaway from this example is that a child theme can provide its own 
custom version of the function only because the parent theme wraps the 
function declaration in an if block that checks for the function first.

266
Part III: Working with WordPress Themes 
Preparing a Parent Theme
WordPress makes it easy for theme developers to make parent themes. 
WordPress does most of the hard work; however, a theme developer must 
follow some rules for a parent theme to function properly.
The terms stylesheet and template have been used numerous times in many 
contexts. Typically, stylesheet refers to a CSS file in a theme, and template 
refers to a template file in the theme. However, these words also have spe-
cific meanings when working with parent and child themes. You must under-
stand the difference between a stylesheet and a template when working with 
parent and child themes.
In WordPress, the active theme is the stylesheet, and the active theme’s 
parent is the template. If the theme doesn’t have a parent, the active theme is 
both the stylesheet and the template.
	
Originally, child themes could replace only the style.css file of a theme. 
The parent provided all the template files and functions.php code. Thus, 
the child theme provided style and design, whereas the parent theme pro-
vided the template files. The capabilities of child themes expanded in future 
versions of WordPress, making the usage of these terms for parent and child 
themes somewhat confusing.
Imagine two themes: parent and child. The following code is in the parent 
theme’s header.php file and loads an additional stylesheet provided by  
the theme:
<link type=”text/css” rel=”stylesheet” media=”all” href=”<?php
bloginfo(‘stylesheet_directory’) ?>/reset.css” />
The bloginfo() function prints information about the site configuration 
or settings. This example uses the function to print the URL location of 
the stylesheet directory. The site is hosted at http://example.com, and 
the parent is the active theme. The preceding code produces the following 
output:
<link type=”text/css” rel=”stylesheet” media=”all”
href=”http://example.com/wp-content/themes/Parent/reset.css” />
If the child theme is activated, the output is
<link type=”text/css” rel=”stylesheet” media=”all”
href=”http://example.com/wp-content/themes/Child/reset.css” />

267
 Chapter 13: Understanding Parent and Child Themes
The location now refers to the reset.css file in the child theme. This can 
work if every child theme copies the reset.css file of the parent theme,  
but requiring child themes to add files to function isn’t good design. The 
solution is simple: Rather than using the stylesheet_directory() in  
the bloginfo() call earlier, use template_directory(). The code looks 
like this:
<link type=”text/css” rel=”stylesheet” media=”all” href=”<?php
bloginfo(‘template_directory’) ?>/reset.css” />
Now, all child themes properly load the parent reset.css file.
When developing, use template_directory in stand-alone parent themes 
and use stylesheet_directory in child themes.

weaking is the practice of changing a few elements of an existing WordPress 
theme. Thousands of WordPress website owners tweak their existing 
themes regularly. This chapter provides information on some of the most 
common tweaks you can make to your theme, such as changing the header 
image, the color of the background or the text links, and font styles — and 
these changes are pretty easy to make, too. You’ll be tweaking your own 
theme in no time flat.
This chapter introduces you to the basics of CSS and HTML markup that you 
use to provide style and structure to your WordPress theme. When combined 
with the functions and template tags that I cover in Chapters 11 and 12, CSS 
styling and HTML markup provide the finishing touches for a pleasing look 
and format for your website.
	
Before you go too wild with tweaking templates, make a backup of your theme 
so that you have the original files from which you can easily restore if you need 
to. You can back up your theme files by connecting to your web server via FTP 
(described in Chapter 5) and downloading your theme folder to your com-
puter. When you have the original theme files safe and secure on your hard 
drive, feel free to tweak away, comfortable in the knowledge that you have a 
backup.

272
Part IV: Building Your Custom Website 
Styling with CSS: The Basics
Knowing some key Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) concepts can help you per-
sonalize your theme’s stylesheet. CSS is simply a set of commands that allow 
you to customize the look and feel of your HTML markup. Some common 
commands and tools that I discuss here are selectors, IDs and classes, 
properties and values, and more. Together, you can use these commands to 
modify HTML to display your design customizations. (You can find out more 
about HTML in the section “Understanding Basic HTML Techniques to Use on 
Your Site,” later in this chapter.)
Introducing CSS
A Cascading Style Sheet is a stylesheet that controls the appearance of con-
tent on a website. Every WordPress theme you use in your site uses CSS. 
CSS provides style and design flair to the template tags in your templates. 
(See Chapters 11 and 12 for information about WordPress template tags.) 
The CSS for your WordPress theme is pulled in through the Header template 
(header.php), and the file is named style.css.
On your Dashboard, choose Appearance➪Editor to open the Edit Themes 
page shown in Figure 14-1. Look at the far right side of the page under the 
Templates heading, scroll down to find the Header link, and click it to open 
the Header template. You find the following line of code, which pulls the  
CSS (style.css) into the page to provide the formatting of the elements of 
your site:
<link rel=”stylesheet” type=”text/css” media=”all” href=”<?php bloginfo( 
‘stylesheet_url’ ); ?>” />
	
Don’t tweak the line of code that pulls in the style.css file; otherwise, CSS 
won’t work for your site.
On the Edit Themes page, you can also explore your theme’s stylesheet. 
When you first open this page, your theme’s main stylesheet (style.css) 
appears by default, as shown in Figure 14-1. If not, under the Templates 
heading on the far right, scroll down to find the Styles heading and click the 
Stylesheet link to view the style.css file.
With CSS changes to your theme’s stylesheet, you can apply unique styling 
such as fonts, sizes, and colors to headlines, text, links, and borders, and 
adjust the spacing between them, too. With all the CSS options available, you 
can fine-tune the look and feel of different elements with simple tweaks.

273
 Chapter 14: Using Basic CSS and HTML to Customize Your Site Design
Figure 14-1: The WordPress default Twenty Thirteen theme stylesheet, style.css.
	
Making changes to the stylesheet or any other theme file can cause your site 
to load the theme improperly. Be careful what you change here. When you 
make changes, ensure you’re on a playground or sandbox site so that you 
can easily restore your original file and don’t permanently affect a live or 
important site. (See Chapter 8 for details on setting up a sandbox environ-
ment.) I also recommend saving a copy of the original stylesheet in a text 
program, such as Notepad (Windows) or TextMate (Mac), so if needed, you 
can find the original CSS and copy and paste it back into your stylesheet.
CSS selectors
With CSS, you can provide style (such as size, color, and placement) to the 
display of elements (such as text links, header images, font size and colors, 
paragraph margins, and line spacing) on your site. CSS selectors contain names, 
properties, and values to define which HTML elements in the templates you’ll 
style with CSS. Table 14-1 provides some examples of CSS selectors and their 
uses.

Classes and IDs
You can find the stylesheet (style.css) for the default Twenty Thirteen 
theme on the Edit Themes page on your Dashboard (refer to Figure 14-1). 
Everything in it may look foreign to you right now, but I want to bring your 
attention to two items you see when you scroll down through that template:
	
✓	#container: This is one type of CSS selector. The hash mark (#) indi-
cates that it’s a CSS ID and can be used only once per page.
	
✓	.onecolumn: This is another type of CSS selector. The period (.) indi-
cates that it’s a CSS class and can be used multiple times on a page to 
automate changes that are made more than once.
IDs and classes define styling properties for different sections of your 
WordPress theme. Table 14-2 shows examples of IDs and classes from the 
header.php template in the Twenty Thirteen WordPress theme. Armed with 
this information, you know where to look in the stylesheet when you want to 
change the styling for a particular area of your theme.

If you find an element in the template code that says id (such as div id= 
or p id=), look for the hash symbol in the stylesheet. If you find an element 
in the template code that says class (such as div class= or p class=), 
look for the period in the stylesheet followed by the selector name.
CSS properties and values
CSS properties are assigned to the CSS selector name. You also need to pro-
vide values for the CSS properties to define the style elements for the particu-
lar CSS selector you’re working with.
In the default Twenty Thirteen WordPress theme, for example, the first piece 
of markup in the Header template (header.php) is <div id=”wrapper”>. 
This ID, with the name wrapper, provides styling for the site page.
In the default Twenty Thirteen WordPress theme stylesheet, the CSS defined 
for the site class is as follows:

276
Part IV: Building Your Custom Website 
.site {
background-color: #fff;
border-left: 1px solid #f2f2f2;
border-right: 1px solid #f2f2f2;
margin: 0 auto;
max-width: 1600px;
width: 100%;
}
	
Every CSS property needs to be followed by a colon (:), and each CSS value 
needs to be followed by a semicolon (;).
The CSS selector is .site, which has six properties:
	
✓	The first CSS property is background-color, which has the value of 
#fff (or white).
	
✓	The second CSS property is border-left, which has the value 1px 
solid #f2f2f2 (a light gray border that is 1 pixel in width).
	
✓	The third CSS property is border-right, which has the value 1px 
solid #f2f2f2 (a light gray border that is 1 pixel in width).
	
✓	The fourth CSS property is margin, which has the value 0 auto.
	
✓	The fifth CSS property is max-width, which has the value of 1600px 
(the maximum width).
	
✓	The sixth, and final, CSS property is width, which has the value 100% 
(uses 100% of the available width of the browser window).

Changing the Background Image  
or Color Used in Your Theme
In the following sections, I show you how to add the custom background 
feature to your theme so that you can easily tweak the background color or 
image through the Dashboard. Alternatively, you can use the <body> tag in a 
Header template to change the background color or image of your website. (I 
discuss the Header template [header.php] in more detail in Chapter 12.)
Adding the custom background feature to a theme
The Twenty Thirteen WordPress theme is not packaged with an available 
feature in WordPress that allows you to change the background to a different 
color or use an image for your background. There is, however, a nifty feature 
you can add to your WordPress functions.php file to allow your theme to 
support the custom background feature, enabling you to change the back-
ground image and/or color for your site.

278
Part IV: Building Your Custom Website 
You can add the custom background feature to any theme with just one line 
of code. Follow these steps:
	
1.	From the Dashboard, choose Appearance➪Editor.
	
	 The Edit Themes page appears.
	
2.	Click the Theme Functions (functions.php) template on the right 
side of the page.
	
	 The Theme Functions template opens in the text editor in the middle of 
the page.
	
3.	Add the following line of code to the Theme Functions template 
before the closing ?> tag:
add_custom_background();
	
	 This line of code tells WordPress that your theme has added the custom 
background feature.
	
4.	Click the Save File button.
	
	 The Theme Functions template is saved, along with your changes. The 
Background link now appears below the Appearance menu on your 
Dashboard.
Customizing the background
Any theme that has the custom background feature allows you to change the 
background to a different color or use an image for it. To change the back-
ground for your website, follow these steps:
	
1.	Choose Appearance➪Background.
	
	 The Custom Background page loads on the Dashboard. By default, the 
background color is set to white.
	
2a.	To change the background color, click the Select Color button and 
then type the hexadecimal color code in the Color text box and then 
skip to Step 4.
	
	 If you don’t know what hex code you want to use, click the Select a Color 
button and then, in the color selector that appears, click a color, as 
shown in Figure 14-2. (Note that when you click the Select Color button, 
the text changes to Current Color.)
	
	 A hexadecimal (or hex) code represents a certain color. Hex codes 
always start with a hash symbol (#) and have six letters and/or numbers 
to represent a particular color, such as #d5d6d7 (light gray). I talk more 
about hexadecimal values in Chapter 7.

279
 Chapter 14: Using Basic CSS and HTML to Customize Your Site Design
Figure 14-2: The color selector on the Custom Background page.
	
2b.	To use an image file for the background, upload an image from your 
computer:
	
a.	Click the Browse button in the Select Image section and then select a 
file from your computer.
	
b.	Click the Upload button.
	
	The Custom Background page refreshes and gives you several  
display options.
	
3.	Change the display options for your new background image:
	
•	Position: Select Left, Center, or Right to set the screen position of 
the background image on your website.
	
•	Repeat: Choose No Repeat, Tile, Tile Horizontally, or Tile Vertically 
in this drop-down list to set the image on your website.
	
•	Attachment: Select Scroll to set the background image to scroll 
down the page, or select Fixed to set the background image in a 
static position so that it doesn’t scroll down the page.

280
Part IV: Building Your Custom Website 
	
4.	Click the Save Changes button.
	
	 Be sure to click the Save Changes button before navigating away from 
the Custom Background page; otherwise, your new settings aren’t saved.
	
Because all themes are not created equal, themes that don’t have the custom 
header and background features enabled make it a little more challenging to 
change these elements. Without these features, you have to make tweaks via 
the theme CSS (style.css), covered in the next section.
Changing the background using CSS
The <body> tag is simple HTML markup. Every theme has this tag, which 
defines the overall default content for each page of your website — the site’s 
body.
In the stylesheet (style.css), the background for the body is defined like 
this:
body {
 background: #f1f1f1;
}
The background for the <body> tag uses a hexadecimal color code of 
#f1f1f1, which gives the background a light gray color.
You can use a color or an image to style the background of your website. You 
can also use a combination of colors and images in your backgrounds.
Using an image as the site’s background
You can easily use an image as a background for your site by uploading the 
image to the images folder in your theme directory. That value looks like this:
background: url(images/yourimage.jpg) 
	
The url portion of this code automatically pulls in the URL of your site, so 
you don’t have to change the url part to your URL.
Changing the background color
If you want to change the background color of your theme, follow these steps:
	
1.	On the WordPress Dashboard, choose Appearance➪Editor.
	
	 The Edit Themes page opens.
	
2.	From the Select Theme to Edit drop-down list, choose the theme you 
want to change.

281
 Chapter 14: Using Basic CSS and HTML to Customize Your Site Design
	
3.	Click the Stylesheet link in the list of templates.
	
	 The style.css template opens in the text editor in the middle of the 
Edit Themes page (refer to Figure 14-1).
	
4.	Scroll down in the text editor until you find the CSS selector body.
	
	 If you’re tweaking the default theme, this section is what you’re  
looking for:
body {
 background: #f1f1f1;
}
	
	 If you’re tweaking a different template, the CSS selector body looks  
similar.
	
5.	Edit the background property’s values.
	
	 For example, in the default template, if you want to change the back-
ground color to black, you can enter either
background: #000000;
	
	 or
background: black;
	
	 In the case of some basic colors, you don’t have to use the hex code. 
For colors like white, black, red, blue, and silver, you can just use their 
names — background: black, for example.
	
	 The W3Schools website has a great resource on hex codes at http://
w3schools.com/HTML/html_colornames.asp.
	
6.	Click the Update File button near the bottom of the page.
	
	 Your changes are saved and applied to your theme.
	
7.	Visit your site in your web browser.
	
	 The background color of your theme has changed.
Defining and Positioning Your  
Header Image with CSS
Most themes have a header image that appears at the top of the page. This 
image is generated by a graphic defined either in the CSS value for the prop-
erty that represents the header area or through the use of a custom header 
feature in WordPress.

282
Part IV: Building Your Custom Website 
Defining a background image to use as a header
In the WordPress default Twenty Thirteen theme, including a custom header 
image on a site that uses the Twenty Thirteen theme is pretty darn easy, as I 
describe in Chapter 10. All the hard work’s been done for you.
In themes that don’t have the custom header image feature, you can easily 
define a background image for the header image using CSS. For purposes of 
this example, the HTML markup for the header in the template is 
<div id=”header”></div>
In the CSS (style.css) file, you can use a background image by defining it in 
the CSS properties for #header. Use this code:
#header {
background: url(/images/header-image.jpg) no-repeat;
width: 980px;
height: 100px;
}
The background value indicates a header-image.jpg image. For that image 
to appear on your site, you need to create the image and upload it to your 
web server in the /images/ directory.
	
When working with graphics on the web, I recommend using GIF, JPG, or PNG 
image formats. For images with a small number of colors (such as charts, line 
art, logos, and so on), GIF format works best. For other image types (screen-
shots with text and images, blended transparency, and so on), use JPG or 
PNG. I discuss graphics in more detail in Chapter 6.
Positioning, repeating, or scrolling  
your background image
After you upload a graphic to use in your theme, you can use CSS background 
properties to position it. The main CSS properties — background-position, 
background-repeat, and background-attachment — help you achieve 
the desired effect. Table 14-4 describes the CSS background properties and 
their available values for changing them in your theme stylesheet.

In the preceding section, the code example uploads a new background graphic 
named header-image.jpg. You can explore the positioning of this graphic 
with some of the values provided in Table 14-4. If you’re a visual person like 
me, you’ll enjoy testing and tweaking values to see the effects on your site.
Say your goal is to tile, or repeat, the background image horizontally, or 
across the browser screen from left to right so that it scales with the width of 
the browser on any computer. You also want to change the background color 

284
Part IV: Building Your Custom Website 
to a different color (like white, as in the following sample). To achieve this, 
open the stylesheet again and change:
background: #f1f1f1;
to
background: #FFFFFF;
background-image: url(images/header-image.jpg);
background-repeat: repeat-x;
or you can use
background: #FFFFFF url(images/header-image.jpg) repeat-x;
Changing Basic Elements to Create  
a Unique Look for Your Site
When you understand the basic concepts about personalizing your site with 
graphics and CSS, you begin to see how easy it is to change the look and feel 
of your site with these tools. The next few sections explore some of my favor-
ite ways to accomplish an interesting design presentation or a unique and 
creative look.
Adding background colors and image effects
Earlier in this chapter, I provide you with a few examples of how you can change 
your background colors and image, as well as the image and/or background 
color for your header graphic, by adjusting the CSS and HTML. Changing the 
background image can completely change the feel of your site. However, you 
can also use background colors and images for other elements in your theme.
Background techniques include using solid colors and repeating gradients or 
patterns to achieve a subtle yet polished effect.
	
Use colors that accent the colors of your logo and don’t hamper text readability.
You can add CSS background colors and image effects to the following areas 
of your theme:
	
✓	Post and page content sections
	
✓	Sidebar widgets
	
✓	Comment blocks
	
✓	The footer area

285
 Chapter 14: Using Basic CSS and HTML to Customize Your Site Design
Choosing a font family, color, and size
You can change the fonts in your theme for style or readability purposes. I’ve 
seen typographic (or font) design experts use simple font variations to achieve 
amazing design results. You can use fonts to separate headlines from body text 
(or widget headlines and text from the main content) to be less distracting. 
Table 14-5 lists some examples of often-used font properties.
Table 14-5

Font family
The web is actually kind of picky about how it displays fonts, as well as what 
kind of fonts you can use in the font-family property. Not all fonts appear 
correctly on the web. To be safe, here are some commonly used font families 
that appear correctly in most browsers:
	
✓	Serif fonts: Times New Roman, Georgia, Garamond, and Bookman Old 
Style
	
✓	Sans-serif fonts: Verdana, Arial, Tahoma, and Trebuchet MS
	
Serif fonts have little tails, or curlicues, at the edges of letters. (This text is in 
a serif font.) Sans-serif fonts have straight edges and are devoid of any fancy 
styling. (The heading in Table 14-5 uses a sans-serif font . . . no tails!)
When you want to change a font family in your CSS, open the stylesheet 
(style.css), search for property: font-family, change the values for 
that property, and save your changes.
In the default template CSS, the font is defined in the <body> tag like this:
font-family: Georgia, “Bitstream Charter”, serif;

286
Part IV: Building Your Custom Website 
Font color
With more than 16 million HTML color combinations available, you can find 
just the right shade of color for your project. After some time, you’ll memo-
rize your favorite color codes. I find that knowing codes for different shades 
of gray helps me quickly add an extra design touch. For example, I often use 
the shades of gray listed in Table 14-6 for backgrounds, borders on design 
elements, and widget headers.
Table 14-6

#FFFFFF or #FFF
Black
#000000 or #000
Grays
#CCCCCC or #CCC
#DDDDDD or #DDD
#333333 or #333 #E0E0E0
You can easily change the color of your font by changing the color property 
of the CSS selector you want to tweak. You can use hex codes to define the 
colors.
You can define the overall font color in your site by defining it in the body 
CSS selector like this:
body {
color: #333;
}
Font size
To tweak the size of your font, change the font-size property of the CSS 
selector you want to adjust. Font sizes are generally determined by units of 
measurement, as in these examples:
	
✓	px: Pixel measurement, or px; increasing or decreasing the number of 
pixels increases or decreases the font size (12px is larger than 10px).
	
✓	pt: Point measurement, or pt; as with pixels, increasing or decreasing 
the number of points affects the font size accordingly (12pt is larger 
than 10pt).
	
✓	%: Percentage measurement, or %; increasing or decreasing the percent-
age number affects the font size accordingly (50% is equivalent to 8 
pixels; 100% is equivalent to 16 pixels).

287
 Chapter 14: Using Basic CSS and HTML to Customize Your Site Design
In the default template CSS, the font size is defined in the body tag in pixels, 
like this: 
font-size: 12px;
Putting it all together
Style the font for the overall body of your site by putting all three elements 
(font-family, color, and font-size) together in the <body> tag. Here’s how they 
work together in the <body> tag of the default template CSS:
body {
font-size: 12px;
font-family: Georgia, “Bitstream Charter”, serif;
color: #666;
}
Using borders in your design
CSS borders can add an interesting and unique flair to elements of your 
theme design. Table 14-7 illustrates common properties and CSS examples for 
borders in your theme design.
	
You can save lots of room by using the border shorthand in your CSS that 
defines the border size, style, and color all in one line, such as border: 1px 
solid #CCCCCC.

Understanding Basic HTML Techniques  
to Use on Your Site
HTML can help you customize and organize your theme. To understand how 
HTML and CSS work together, think of it this way: If a website were a build-
ing, HTML would be the structure (the studs and foundation), and CSS would 
be the paint.

288
Part IV: Building Your Custom Website 
HTML contains the elements that CSS provides the styles for. All you have to 
do to apply a CSS style is use the right HTML element. Here is a very basic 
block of HTML that I can break down for this example:
<body>
<div id=”content”>
<h1>Headline Goes Here</h1>
<p>This is a sample sentence of body text. <blockquote>The journey of a thousand 
miles starts with the first step.</blockquote> I’m going to 
continue on this sentence and end it here. </p>
<p>Click <a href=”http://lisasabin-wilson.com”>here</a> to visit my website.</p>
</div>
</body>
All HTML elements must have opening and closing tags. Opening tags are 
contained in less-than (<) and greater-than (>) symbols. Closing tags are the 
same, except they’re preceded by a forward slash (/).
For example:
<h1>Headline Goes Here</h1>
Note that the HTML elements must be properly nested. In line four of the 
previous example, a paragraph tag is opened (<p>). Later in that line, a block 
quote is opened (<blockquote>) and nested inside the paragraph tag. When 
Finding additional resources  
for customizing themes
At some point, you may want to explore custom-
izing your theme further. Here are some recom-
mended resources:

documentation (http://codex. 
wordpress.org)
	✓	W3Schools: A free and comprehensive 
online HTML and CSS reference (http://

tricks for customizing a WordPress theme 
(http://smashingmagazine.com)

289
 Chapter 14: Using Basic CSS and HTML to Customize Your Site Design
editing this line, you can’t end the paragraph (</p>) before you end the 
block quote (</blockquote>). Nested elements must close before the ele-
ments they’re nested within close.
Finally, proper tabbing, or indenting, is important when writing HTML, mainly 
for readability so you can quickly scan through code to find what you’re look-
ing for. A good rule is that if you didn’t close a tag in the line above, indent 
one tab over. This allows you to see where each element begins and ends. 
Tabbing can also be very helpful when diagnosing problems.
You’ll use several very basic HTML markup practices over and over in web 
design. Earlier in this chapter, I discuss how to combine CSS styling with 
HTML markup to create different display styles (borders, fonts, and so on). 
The following sections provide you with commonly used HTML markup sam-
ples that are helpful as a reference for using HTML in your website code.
Inserting images
Many times, you’ll want to insert an image in your website, whether within 
the body of a post or page, in the sidebar by using a widget, or within the 
template code itself. The HTML markup to insert an image looks like this:
<img src=”/path/to/image-file.jpg” alt=”Image File Name” />
I break down this code for you in easy snippets to help you understand what 
is at work here:
	
✓	<img src=: This is the HTML markup that tells the browser that the 
website is looking for an image file.
	
✓	“/path/to/image-file.jpg”: This is the actual directory path where 
the web browser can find the image file. For example, if you upload an 
image to your web server in the /wp-content/uploads directory,  
the path for that image file would be /wp-content/uploads/image- 
file.jpg.
	
✓	alt=“Image File Name”: The alt tag is part of the HTML markup and 
provides a description for the image that search engines can pick up and 
recognize as keywords. The alt tag description will also appear as text 
on browsers that can’t, for some reason, load the image file. For exam-
ple, if the server load time is slow, the text description loads first to at 
least provide visitors with a description of what the image is.
	
✓	/>: This HTML markup tag closes the initial <img src=” tag, telling the 
web browser when the call to the image file is complete.

290
Part IV: Building Your Custom Website 
Inserting hyperlinks
Many times, you’ll want to insert a link within the body of a website, com-
monly referred to as a hyperlink. This is a line of text that’s anchored to a 
web address (URL) so that when visitors on your website click the text, it 
takes them to another website, or page, in their browser window. The HTML 
markup to insert a hyperlink looks like this:
<a href=”http://wiley.com”>Wiley</a>
To break down that markup, here’s a simple explanation:
	
✓	<a href=: This is the HTML markup that tells the browser that the text 
within this tag should be hyperlinked to the web address provided in 
the next bullet point.
	
✓	“http://wiley.com”: This is the URL that you want the text to be 
anchored to. The URL needs to be surrounded by quotes, which defines 
it as the intended anchor, or address.
	
✓	”>: This markup closes the previously opened <a href= HTML tag.
	
✓	Wiley: In this example, this is the text that is linked, or anchored, by the 
URL. This text appears on your website and is clickable by your visitors.
	
✓	</a>: This HTML markup tag tells the web browser that the hyperlink 
is closed. Anything that exists between <a href=“..”> and </a> will 
be hyperlinked, or clickable, through to the intended anchor, or web 
address.
Commonly, designers use URLs to link words to other websites or pages. 
However, you can also provide hyperlinks to PDF files (Adobe Acrobat), DOC 
files (Microsoft Word), or any other file type.
Inserting lists
You may need to provide a clean-looking format for lists that you publish on 
your website. With HTML markup, you can easily provide lists that are for-
matted differently, depending on your needs.
Ordered lists are numbered sequentially, such as a steps list of things to do, 
like this:
	
1.	 Write my book chapters.
	
2.	 Submit my book chapters to my publisher.
	
3.	 Panic a little when the book is released to the public.
	
4.	 Breathe a sigh of relief when reviews are overwhelmingly positive!

291
 Chapter 14: Using Basic CSS and HTML to Customize Your Site Design
Ordered lists are easy to do in a program like Microsoft Word, or even in the 
WordPress post editor because you can use the What You See Is What You 
Get (WYSIWYG) editor to format the list for you. However, if you want to 
code an ordered list using HTML, it’s a little different. My preceding steps list 
sample looks like this when using HTML markup:
<ol>
<li>Write my book chapters.</li>
<li>Submit my book chapters to my publisher.</li>
<li>Panic a little when the book is released to the public.</li>
<li>Breathe a sigh of relief when reviews are overwhelmingly positive!</li>
</ol>
The beginning <ol> tells a web browser to display this list as an ordered list, 
meaning that it will be ordered with numbers starting with the number 1. The 
entire list ends with the </ol> HTML tag, which tells the web browser that 
the ordered list is now complete.
Between <ol> and </ol> are list items designated as such by the HTML 
markup <li>. Each list item starts with <li> and ends with </li>, which 
tells the web browser to display the line of text as one list item.
	
If you fail to close any open HTML markup tags — for example, if you start an 
ordered list with <ol> but fail to include the closing </ol> at the end — it 
messes up the display on your website. The web browser considers anything 
beneath the initial <ol> to be part of the ordered list until it recognizes the 
closing tag </ol>.
Unordered lists are very similar to ordered lists, except instead of using  
numbers, they use bullet points to display the list, like this:
	
✓	Write my book chapters.
	
✓	Submit my book chapters to my publisher.
	
✓	Panic a little when the book is released to the public.
	
✓	Breathe a sigh of relief when reviews are overwhelmingly positive!
The HTML markup for an unordered list is just like the ordered list, except 
instead of using the <ol> tag, it uses the <ul> tag (ul stands for unordered 
list):
<ul>
<li>Write my book chapters.</li>
<li>Submit my book chapters to my publisher.</li>
<li>Panic a little when the book is released to the public.</li>
<li>Breathe a sigh of relief when reviews are overwhelmingly positive!</li>
</ul>

292
Part IV: Building Your Custom Website 
	
Both the ordered and unordered lists use the list item tags <li> and </li>. 
The only difference between the two lists is in the first opening and last  
closing tags. Ordered lists use <ol> and </ol>, whereas unordered lists  
use <ul> and </ul>.

s I note throughout this book, WordPress is not simply a blogging plat-
form; it’s also a solution for building your own website. The self-hosted 
version of WordPress, WordPress.org, is a powerful content management 
system that’s flexible and extensible enough to run an entire website — with 
no blog at all, if you prefer.
A content management system (CMS) is a system used to create and maintain 
your entire site; it includes tools for publishing and editing, as well as for 
searching and retrieving information and content. A CMS lets you maintain 
your website with little or no HTML knowledge. You can create, modify, 
retrieve, and update your content without ever touching the code required to 
perform those tasks.
This chapter shows you a few ways that you can use the self-hosted 
WordPress.org software to power your entire website, with or without a blog. 
I cover various template configurations that you can use to create separate 
sections of your site. You also discover how to use the front page of your site 
as a static page or a portal — a page that contains snippets from other sec-
tions of your site, with links to those sections — which can include a link to 
an internal blog page, if you want a blog.
	
You can also add tools to your WordPress website that extend the basic func-
tions of WordPress by adding elements such as an e-commerce store, photo 
galleries, social communities, and so on. Chapter 16 covers some of the tools 
you can add to WordPress to extend it to meet your needs, whereas this 
chapter shows you how to use internal, built-in features of WordPress to get 
started using it as a full-blown CMS tool.

294
Part IV: Building Your Custom Website 
Creating the Front Page of Your Website
For the most part, when you visit a blog powered by WordPress, the blog is 
on the main page. My personal blog (http://lisasabin-wilson.com), 
powered by WordPress (of course), shows my latest blog posts on the front 
page. This setup is typical of a site run by WordPress. See Figure 15-1.
But the front page of my business site (http://webdevstudios.com), also 
powered by WordPress, contains no blog; see Figure 15-2. This site doesn’t 
display any blog posts; rather, it displays the contents of a static page — a 
page that’s not dynamically updated chronologically like a blog — I cre-
ated on the WordPress Dashboard. This static page serves as a portal to my 
design blog, my portfolio, and other sections of my site. The site includes a 
blog, but also serves as a full-blown business website, with all the sections I 
need to provide my clients with the information they want.
Figure 15-1: My personal blog, set up like a typical site powered by WordPress.

295
 Chapter 15: Designing for WordPress as a CMS
Figure 15-2: My business site, set up as a business website rather than a blog.
Both of my sites are powered by the self-hosted version of WordPress.org, 
so how can they differ so much in what they display on the front page? The 
answer lies in the templates on the WordPress Dashboard. (I discuss tem-
plates in detail in Part III of this book.)
You use static pages in WordPress to create content that you don’t want to 
display as part of your blog but do want to display as part of your overall site 
(such as a bio page, a page of services, and so on).
Creating a front page is a three-step process:
	
1.	 Create a static page.
	
2.	 Designate that static page as the front page of your site.
	
3.	 Tweak the page to look like a website rather than a blog.
	
Using this method, you can create an unlimited number of static pages to 
build an entire website. You don’t even need to have a blog on this site 
unless you want to include one.

296
Part IV: Building Your Custom Website 
Creating a static page
To have a static page appear on the front page of your site, you need to 
create that page. Follow these steps:
	
1.	From the Dashboard, choose Pages➪Add New.
	
	 The Add New Page screen opens where you can write a new page to 
your WordPress site, as shown in Figure 15-3.
	
2.	Type a title for the page toward the top.
	
	 For example, I want to create a Welcome page as the front page for my 
website, so I entered Welcome to My Website for the page title.
	
3.	Type the content of your page in the text box.
	
	 The content you include here is up to you. You can simply use text or 
a combination of text and images (see Chapter 16 for information on 
including images and photo galleries), and even a featured image if your 
theme is using that feature in WordPress (see Chapter 12).

 Chapter 15: Designing for WordPress as a CMS
	
4.	In the Page Attributes section, set the options for this page, as needed:
	
•	Parent: Leave this set to (No Parent) because this is the page you 
will use (in the next section) as the front page of your site. With 
other pages, you can set the page as a subpage, underneath a top-
level, or parent, page to create a hierarchy of pages for your site 
navigation.
	
•	Template: The Template option is set to Default Template. This set-
ting tells WordPress that you want to use the default Page template 
(page.php in your theme template files) to format the page you’re 
creating. The default template is the default setting for all pages 
you create. I discuss assigning a page to a different template in 
Chapter 12.
	
•	Order: This is the order in which you’d like this page to appear in 
your navigation menu, if you are not using the built-in menu fea-
ture in WordPress (see Chapter 10) and are using the wp_list_
pages() template tag (see Chapter 12).
	
5.	(Optional) If you want to preview your page before publishing it, click 
the Preview button in the upper-right corner.
	
6.	When you’re satisfied with your page, click the Publish button.
	
	 The page is saved to your database and published to your WordPress 
site with its own individual URL (or permalink, as explained in Chapter 
4). The URL for the static page consists of your website URL and the title 
of the page. For example, if you titled your page About Me, the URL of 
the page is http://yourdomain.com/about-me.
Assigning a static page as the front page
You need to tell WordPress that you want the static page you just created to 
serve as the front page of your site. To do so, follow these steps:
	
1.	From the Dashboard, choose Settings➪Reading.
	
	 The Reading Settings page appears.
	
2.	In the Front Page Displays section, select the A Static Page radio 
button.
	
3.	From the Front Page drop-down list, choose the static page that you 
want to serve as your front page.
	
	 In Figure 15-4, I choose to display the Welcome to My Website page from 
the preceding section. Don’t worry about the rest of the options on the 
Reading Settings page because they don’t pertain to configuring which 
page to use for the front page of your site.

298

4.	Click the Save Changes button at the bottom of page.
	
	 WordPress displays the page you selected in Step 3 as the front page of your 
site. Figure 15-5 shows my site displaying the page I created as my front page.

 Chapter 15: Designing for WordPress as a CMS
Tweaking the page to look like  
a website rather than a blog
Using a static page as a front page allows you to get creative with the design 
and layout of your page. You can assign a page template (see “Creating 
Custom Page Templates to Achieve Different Layouts and Styles,” later in this 
chapter) and/or use widgets to include different types of content and infor-
mation, such as
	
✓	Featured Images: Chapter 12 covers how to add the built-in WordPress 
feature called Featured Images (or post thumbnails). You can create a 
page template that includes the titles and excerpts of your most recent 
blog posts (if you’re using a blog) and display them in the body or side-
bar with a featured image thumbnail. You use the WP_Query() class tag, 
covered in Chapter 12 and shown in the following code sample, which 
displays the four most recent posts from your blog:
<?php $the_query = new WP_Query(‘posts_per_page=4’); ?>
<?php while ($the_query->have_posts()) : $the_query->the_post(); ?>
<strong><a href=”<?php the_permalink() ?>” rel=”bookmark” title=”Permanent 
Link to
<?php the_title_attribute(); ?>”><?php the_title(); ?></a></strong>
<?php if ( has_post_thumbnail() ) { the_post_thumbnail(‘thumbnail’); ?>
<?php the_excerpt(); ?>
<?php endwhile; ?>
	
✓	Featured Content Slider: Using a nifty plugin for WordPress called the 
Featured Content Slider (http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/
wp-featured-content-slider), you can include a slide show of your 
most recent posts (if you’re using a blog) that contains featured images, 
excerpts of the text, and the title on your front page, which is a nice way 
to invite readers into your site to read the posts you’ve written. The 
Featured Content Slider provides you with an options page and widget 
to use on your front page. (See Chapter 12 for details about adding 
widget areas to your theme templates.)
	
✓	Testimonials: Many businesses like to include client testimonials on 
their websites, and one of the best places to display them is on your 
front page so that your visitors can immediately see quotes from your 
happy clients. You can display testimonials with a plugin for WordPress 
called IvyCat AJAX Testimonials (http://wordpress.org/plugins/
ivycat-ajax-testimonials/); after you’ve installed this plugin (as 
described in Chapter 16), you can create testimonials and include them 
on your front page using a widget that the plugin provides. The plugin also 
allows you to create a full testimonials page to display all testimonials — 
be sure to read the plugin documentation to find out how.
	
✓	Portfolio: In the design field, you will most likely want to show off some 
of the work you’ve recently done for web design projects for yourself or 
your clients. On my business website at http://webdevstudios.com, 
we accomplish that through the use of WordPress custom post types, 

300
Part IV: Building Your Custom Website 
categories, featured images, and the WP_Query() template class. Create 
a category on your WordPress Dashboard (choose Posts➪Categories) 
called Portfolio (or whatever you wish to call your body of work) and 
then create posts within the category, and be sure to assign featured 
images to the posts. (See Chapter 12 for more on adding support in your 
theme for featured images, including different image sizes.)
	
	The featured images I use on my website are screenshots that represent 
the design work I’ve completed. I added a specific size for my images in 
the Theme Functions template called portfolio, and then using the WP_
Query() template class, I inserted these lines of code in my home page 
template to display just the images (linked to the individual posts) in my 
portfolio:
<?php $the_query = new WP_Query(‘posts_per_page=3&category_name=portfolio); 
?>
<?php while ($the_query->have_posts()) : $the_query->the_post(); ?>
<?php if (have_posts()) : while (have_posts()) : the_post(); ?>
<a href=”<?php the_permalink() ?>” rel=”bookmark” title=”Permanent Link to
<?php the_title_attribute();?>”>
<?php if ( has_post_thumbnail() ) { the_post_thumbnail(‘portfolio’); ?>
</a>
<?php endwhile; ?>
Adding a Blog to Your Website
If you want a blog on your site but don’t want to display the blog on the front 
page, you can add one on your WordPress Dashboard.
Creating a blank page for the blog
To create a blog for your site, first you need to create a blank page:
	
1.	From the Dashboard, choose Pages➪Add New.
	
	 The Add New Page screen appears (refer to Figure 15-3). This is the page 
where you can write a new post to your WordPress blog.
	
2.	Type a name for the page in the text box toward the top of the page.
	
	 For example, because this will be the main page for your blog, enter 
Blog for the name. This automatically sets the page slug to /blog. (See 
Chapter 4 for information on permalinks and slugs.)
	
3.	Leave the text box blank.

301
 Chapter 15: Designing for WordPress as a CMS
	
	 You leave the text box blank here because you don’t want to display any 
page content on your blog; rather, WordPress displays your blog posts 
using this page after you assign it as your blog (which you do in the 
steps in the next section).
	
4.	Click the Publish button.
	
	 The blank Blog page is saved to your database and published to your 
WordPress site.
	
	 You have a blank page that redirects to http://yourdomain.com/blog.
Next, you need to assign the page you just created as your Blog page.
Assigning the new page as a blog
To designate your new, blank Blog page as a page for your blog posts, follow 
these steps:
	
1.	Choose Settings➪Reading.
	
	 The Reading Settings page opens (refer to Figure 15-4).
	
2.	From the Posts Page drop-down list, choose the page you just created.
	
	 For example, select the Blog page as a posts page.
	
3.	In the Blog Pages Show at Most section, type the number of posts you 
want to display in the Posts text box.
	
	 This setting specifies the number of posts you want to appear on that 
page at any time. If you enter 5, the Blog page shows the last five posts 
you’ve made to your blog. Enter the number of posts you would like to 
appear based on your preference.
	
4.	Click the Save Changes button.
	
	 The options you just set are saved, and your blog is now located at 
http://yourdomain.com/blog (where yourdomain.com is your actual 
domain name). Figure 15-6 shows the Blog page on my business site, 
http://webdevstudios.com/blog, which shows the most recent 
blog posts.
	
You can add a link to your blog in the navigation menu (as shown on my site 
in Figure 15-6) by adding it to your custom menu. To find out how to build 
your own custom menu, check out Chapter 10.

302
Part IV: Building Your Custom Website 
Figure 15-6: My blog at WebDevStudios with several posts displayed.
Creating Custom Page Templates to Achieve 
Different Layouts and Styles
In Chapter 12, I introduce you to using content-specific WordPress templates 
to apply different display views for content on your website. Using Page and 
Category templates, you can provide a different type of reader experience by 
defining the style with CSS and the features and functions with template tags.
You see this often on websites that offer more than simply a blog. Websites 
that sell products or services, or news websites that focus on articles, con-
tent, and advertising, use different page, or content, templates to achieve 
various layouts and styles all within the same website, using the tools 
WordPress gives them.

303
 Chapter 15: Designing for WordPress as a CMS
Viewing the default Page template (page.php)
Using my own business website as an example, you can see that the standard 
Page template (page.php) file displays regular static pages on my site in a two-
column format. The content is on the left, and a sidebar is on the right of the 
About page at http://webdevstudios.com/about, as shown in Figure 15-7.
Content
Sidebar
Figure 15-7: A standard two-column page layout.
The default Page template that creates the display in Figure 15-7 uses basic 
WordPress template tags to call in the header, content, sidebar, and footer 
files. The code within the template looks like Listing 15-1 in the page.php 
template file for my theme.

304
Part IV: Building Your Custom Website 
Listing 15-1:  Default Page Template (page.php)
<?php get_header(); ?>
<div id=”main”>
<?php if (have_posts()) : while (have_posts()) : the_post(); ?>
<div id=”post-<?php the_ID(); ?>” <?php post_class(); ?>>
<h3 class=”title”><a href=”<?php the_permalink() ?>” rel=”bookmark”><?php the_
title(); ?></a></h3>
<div class=”entry”>
<?php the_content(__(‘(more...)’)); ?>
</div>
<?php endwhile; else: ?>
<p><?php _e(‘Sorry, no posts matched your criteria.’); ?></p>
<?php endif; ?>
</div>
</div>
<div id=”side”>
        <ul>
        <?php if ( !function_exists(‘dynamic_sidebar’) || !dynamic_
sidebar(‘Blog’) ) : ?>
        <?php endif; ?>
        </ul>
<?php get_footer(); ?>
Creating a new category Page template
You can use the Page template (page.php) in Listing 15-1 to define the 
layout and style for all the internal pages on your website, providing a stan-
dard and consistent style for your site visitors. However, if your website also 
publishes a portfolio of work that you’ve done for clients, you probably want 
that page to have a different style from the rest of the pages, mainly because 
it presents images that represent your past work.
To accomplish this, create a Design Portfolio category on your site, and for 
every entry you want to appear on the Portfolio page, create a post and assign 
it to the Design Portfolio category. Figure 15-8 shows how my Portfolio page 
appears in a web browser (http://webdevstudios.com/work-portfolio). 
You can see that it’s mainly made up of thumbnail images that are clickable 
through to a full article providing a case study on the design project itself.
To accomplish this display, create a specific template for the Design Portfolio 
category: category-portfolio.php. Every post you create that’s assigned 
to the Design Portfolio category appears in the format that you’ve defined in 
the category-design-portfolio.php template in your theme folder.
If you want the Portfolio page to display a listing of images only, assign a fea-
tured image to each portfolio post, and then in the category-portfolio.
php template, do the following by using the code shown in Listing 15-2:

305
 Chapter 15: Designing for WordPress as a CMS
	
1.	Tell WordPress to display each post from the Design Portfolio cat-
egory, but only display the featured image.
	
2.	Link that featured image to the individual post page.
The code to create the Design Portfolio display looks like Listing 15-2.
Figure 15-8: The Portfolio page layout at WebDevStudios.
Listing 15-2:  Category Page Template (category-design-portfolio.php)
<?php get_header(); ?>
<div id=”main” class=”fullwidth”>
<?php if (have_posts()) : while (have_posts()) : the_post(); ?>
<div id=”post-<?php the_ID(); ?>” <?php post_class(); ?>>
<div class=”entry”>
<a href=”<?php the_permalink(); ?>”><?php the_post_thumbnail(‘thumbnail’); ?></

<p><?php _e(‘Sorry, no posts matched your criteria.’); ?></p>
<?php endif; ?>

<?php get_footer(); ?>

Comparing two Page templates
The differences between the default Page template (Listing 15-1) and the

The differences between the standard, default page layout and the port-

WordPress theme engine. The theme engine allows you to designate and 
define custom looks, layouts, and designs for different types of content. This 
feature helps you create unique websites for you and your clients and is the 
true power behind using WordPress as a CMS.
A lot of people still think of WordPress as simply a blogging platform where 
you can have and display a typical blog on your domain; however, with the 
example I just demonstrated, you can see how you can have a blog and so 
much more on your website with just a few simple tweaks and adjustments to 
the templates that power your website theme.

307
 Chapter 15: Designing for WordPress as a CMS
Creating Different Sidebar and Footer  
Templates for Your Pages
You can create separate Sidebar templates for different pages of your site by 
using a simple include statement. When you write an include statement, 
you’re telling WordPress that you want it to include a specific file on a  
specific page.
The code that pulls the usual Sidebar template (sidebar.php) into all the 
other templates, such as the Main Index template (index.php), looks like this:
<?php get_sidebar(); ?>
What if you create a page and want to use a sidebar that has different infor-
mation from what you have in the Sidebar template (sidebar.php)? Follow 
these steps:
	
1.	Create a new Sidebar template in a text editor, such as Notepad 
(Windows) or TextMate (Mac).
	
2.	Save the file on your computer as sidebar-2.php.
	
3.	Upload sidebar-page.php to your themes folder on your web server.
	
	 See Chapter 5 for more on transferring files with FTP.
	
	 The new Sidebar template is listed in your theme files on the Edit Themes 
page. You can open this page by choosing Appearance➪Editor on the 
Dashboard.
	
4.	To include the sidebar-page.php template in one of your Page 
templates, open the desired template on the Edit Themes page 
(Appearance➪Editor) and then find this code:
<?php get_sidebar(); />
	
5.	Replace the preceding code with this include code:
<?php get_template_part(‘sidebar’, ‘page’); ?>
	
With the get_template_part(); function, you can include virtually any 
file in your WordPress templates. You can use this method to create Footer 
templates for pages on your site, for example. To do this, first create a new 
template with the filename footer-page.php and then locate the following 
code in your template:
<?php get_footer(); ?>
and replace the preceding code with this code:
<?php get_template_part(‘footer, ‘page’); ?>

308
Part IV: Building Your Custom Website 
	
You can do multiple things with WordPress to extend it beyond the blog. 
This chapter gives you a few practical examples with the default Twenty 
Thirteen theme. The point is to show you how to use WordPress to create a 
fully functional website with a CMS platform — anything from the smallest 
personal site to a large business site. See Chapter 12 for a greater explanation 
of using template parts.
Creating Custom Styles for Sticky,  
Category, and Tag Posts
In Chapter 11, I discuss putting together a very basic WordPress theme, 
which includes a Main Index template using The Loop. You can use a custom 
tag to display custom styles for sticky posts (posts that stay at the top of your 
blog at all times), categories, and tags on your blog. That special tag looks 
like this:
<div <?php post_class() ?> id=”post-<?php the_ID(); ?>”>
The part of that template tag that is so cool is the post_class() section. 
This template tag tells WordPress to insert specific HTML markup in your 
template that allows you to use CSS to make custom styles for sticky posts, 
categories, and tags.
	
I mention at the very beginning of this book that I assume you already know 
how to use WordPress, which means you already know all about how to pub-
lish new posts to your blog, including the different options you can set for 
your blog posts, such as categories, tags, and publishing settings. One of the 
settings is the Stick This Post to the Front Page setting. In this section, I show 
you how to custom style those sticky posts — it’s not as messy as it sounds!
For example, I’ve published a post with the following options set for it:
	
✓	Stick This Post to the Front Page
	
✓	Filed in a Category Called WordPress
	
✓	Tagged with News
By having the post_class() tag in your template, WordPress inserts HTML 
markup that allows you to use CSS to style sticky posts, or posts assigned 
to specific tags or categories, differently. WordPress inserted the following 
HTML markup for the post:
<div class=”post sticky category-wordpress tag-news”>

309
 Chapter 15: Designing for WordPress as a CMS
In Chapter 14, I talk about CSS selectors and HTML markup and how they work 
together to create style and format for your WordPress theme. You can go to 
your CSS file and define styles for the following CSS selectors:
	
✓	.post: Use this as the generic style for all posts on your blog. The CSS 
for this tag is
.post {background: #ffffff; border: 1px solid silver; padding: 10px;}
	
	This style makes all posts have a white background with a thin silver 
border and 10 pixels of padding space between the post text and the 
border of the post.
	
✓	.sticky: The concept of sticking a post to your front page is to call 
attention to that post, so you may want to use different CSS styling to 
make it stand out from the rest of the posts on your blog:
.sticky {background: #ffffff; border: 4px solid red; padding: 10px;}
	
	This creates a style for all sticky posts that consists of a white back-
ground, a thicker red border, and 10 pixels of padding space between 
the post text and border of the post.
	
✓	.category-wordpress: Say that you blog a lot about WordPress. Your 
readers may appreciate it if you give them a visual cue to which posts 
on your blog are about that topic. You can do that through CSS by tell-
ing WordPress to display a small WordPress icon on the top-right corner 
of all your posts in the WordPress category:
.category-wordpress {background: url(wordpress-icon.jpg) top right 
no-repeat; height: 100px; width: 100px;}
	
	This code inserts a graphic — wordpress-icon.jpg — that’s 100 
pixels in height and 100 pixels in width at the top-right corner of every 
post you’ve assigned to the WordPress category on your blog.
	
✓	.tag-news: You can style all posts tagged with news the same way 
you’ve styled the categories:
.tag-news {background: #f2f2f2; border: 1px solid black; padding: 10px;}
	
	This CSS styles all posts tagged with news with a light gray background 
and a thin black border with 10 pixels of padding between the post text 
and border of the post.
Using the post-class() tag, combined with CSS, to create dynamic styles 
for the posts on your blog is fun and easy!

Enhancing Your Website  
with Plugins
In This Chapter
▶	Installing plugins on your WordPress website
▶	Exploring e-commerce options for WordPress
▶	Creating photo galleries and portfolios
▶	Providing web forms on your website
▶	Building networking and social communities
▶	Including popular social networks
I
 
n the chapters leading up to this one, I demonstrate the features and func-
tions that are built into the WordPress platform that you can use to create 
WordPress themes to provide an appealing visual layout and look for your 
WordPress website. However, several add-ons, or plugins, for WordPress 
provide solutions for specific needs, such as e-commerce (selling products), 
photo galleries and portfolios, web forms, social networking, and more.
Plugins exist for WordPress to provide solutions for needs that the majority 
of WordPress users don’t have, so the good people at WordPress create them 
as optional, add-on plugins rather than make them part of the core WordPress 
package. That way, WordPress doesn’t become a huge, unmanageable mess.
Several WordPress plugins are available to you for free from the WordPress 
Plugin Directory page at http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins, or you 
can search for and install plugins within the Dashboard. Other, more complex, 
plugins are available for a nominal cost from the developer; you pay a set price 
to download and use the plugin and to obtain support from the plugin author. 
In this chapter, I provide you with a mixture of free and commercial (paid) 
plugins that provide you with the solutions you need for different offerings on 
your website projects.

312
Part IV: Building Your Custom Website 
Installing WordPress Plugins via the Dashboard
This section walks you through the steps of searching for, downloading, 
installing, and activating free plugins in your WordPress Dashboard.
Finding free plugins
WordPress makes finding plugins on the Dashboard pretty easy. Choose 
Plugins➪Add New to open the Install Plugins page, as shown in Figure 16-1. 
You have a number of selections, including the search box. Typing a term 
in this box and clicking the Search Plugins button searches WordPress for 
plugins that match the term.
Figure 16-1: The Install Plugins page.
For example, I typed All in One SEO in the search box and then clicked the 
Search Plugins button. The Search Results tab, shown in Figure 16-2, appears.
At the top of the Install Plugins page, you find links for the following tabs:
	
✓	Search: On this tab, you can search for plugins within the repository. 
This view is the default (refer to Figure 16-1).
	
✓	Search Results: This tab appears after you have searched for a plugin 
using the search form. The tab displays the search results for your 
chosen keyword (see Figure 16-2).
	
✓	Upload: This tab provides you with a means to upload a plugin directly 
into WordPress.

313
 Chapter 16: Enhancing Your Website with Plugins
Figure 16-2: Plugins listed on the Install Plugins page.
	
✓	Featured: This tab displays a selection of plugins featured by WordPress 
as helpful plugins you may want to try.
	
✓	Popular: This tab shows the most popular plugins based on criteria 
selected by WordPress.
	
✓	Newest: This tab shows the most recently added plugins within the 
repository.
	
✓	Favorites: This tab shows the plugins you’ve favorited in the WordPress.
org Plugins Directory.
Each of these tabs provides you with easy access to plugins that you may 
want to try without searching for them. Explore each of these tabs at your 
leisure; you may find some useful plugins this way.
	
At the bottom of the Install Plugins page is a selection of keywords (refer 
to Figure 16-1). When you click a keyword, WordPress displays all plugins 
tagged with that keyword. For example, clicking gallery shows all plugins 
tagged with that keyword, such as NextGen Gallery, a popular plugin. Use 
keywords to find popular plugins among WordPress users without searching 
by term or plugin name.
Installing and activating a plugin
After you find a plugin you like on the Dashboard, follow these steps to  
install it:
	
1.	On the Install Plugins page, click the Details link below the title of the 
plugin you want to install (refer to Figure 16-2).

314
Part IV: Building Your Custom Website 
	
	 For this example, I clicked the Details link for the All in One SEO Pack 
plugin that I show you how to search for in the preceding section. The 
More Information dialog box, which provides a description of the plugin, 
appears with a number of tabs at the top, as shown in Figure 16-3.
Figure 16-3: The More Information dialog box.
	
	 In Figure 16-3, you see the message This plugin has not been 
tested with your current version of WordPress, which is 
sometimes the case if the plugin author hasn’t updated the plugin for 
the latest version of WordPress. You can choose to install it anyway and 
give it a try (and then uninstall it if you find that it doesn’t work) — or 
try to contact the plugin author for information on whether the plugin 
works with the latest version.
	
2.	Click the Installation tab at the top of the dialog box to view the instal-
lation instructions.
	
	 Read the installation instructions before you proceed. Each plugin’s 
installation and activation differ from the others.
	
3.	Click the Description tab and then click the Install Now button to 
install the plugin.

315
 Chapter 16: Enhancing Your Website with Plugins
	
	 The dialog box closes, and the Installing Plugin page appears, with a 
message stating whether your plugin was installed successfully, as 
shown in Figure 16-4.
	
4.	Click the Activate Plugin link to activate the plugin on your website.
Figure 16-4: The Installing Plugin page.
	
	 If you see anything other than a message indicating success, follow 
the support instructions in the Plugin Information dialog box on the 
Description tab, including, possibly, the FAQ tab or Support link. Always 
note any error messages you see.
	
5.	Choose Plugins➪Plugins on the Dashboard to verify that the plugin 
installed successfully.
	
	 The plugin appears in the list on the Plugins page, as shown in Figure 16-5.
Figure 16-5: A list of installed plugins.

316
Part IV: Building Your Custom Website 
Installing Plugins Manually
Manually installing a plugin isn’t as easy as the method I describe in the pre-
ceding section. However, you can use the preceding installation method only 
for free plugins from the Plugin Directory page within the Dashboard. Any 
commercial (or paid) plugins require that you install them manually via File 
Transfer Protocol, for example. (For more on FTP, see Chapter 5).
Follow these steps to install a plugin via FTP in your WordPress installation:
	
1.	Download the plugin from the source to your computer.
	
	 Commercial plugin developers provide you with links that you can click 
to download the plugin files — usually, in a Zip file.
	
	 Throughout this chapter, I describe a number of commercial plugins 
that you may want to use on your site.
	
2.	After you download the plugin to your computer, if it’s in a com-
pressed Zip file, unzip it to access the uncompressed files.
	
	 If the file is zipped (compressed), use a free web application (such as 
WinZip, www.winzip.com) to unzip the plugin.
	
3.	Connect to your server using your preferred FTP application.
	
	 If you’re not sure how to transfer files with FTP, see Chapter 5.
	
4.	Navigate to the wp-content folder within the WordPress installation 
for your website.
	
5.	In the wp-content directory, find the plugins directory; upload your 
plugin to this location via FTP.
	
	Congratulations — your plugin is installed, but you still need to activate it.
	
6.	Choose Plugins➪Plugins on your Dashboard.
	
	 The Installing Plugin page appears.
	
7.	Click the Activate link that appears below the plugin’s title.
	
Some of the plugins I describe in this chapter are free ones that you can find 
on the Plugin Directory page, and others are commercial plugins that you 
have to download directly from the developers’ websites. I indicate whether 
the plugin can be installed automatically within your Dashboard or needs to 
be installed manually through FTP.
Exploring E-Commerce Plugins to Use on Your Site
With a lot of businesses and individuals turning to the web to increase their 
profit margins or make a little money, e-commerce solutions have become a hot 
item in the WordPress world. WordPress already makes creating a website 

317
 Chapter 16: Enhancing Your Website with Plugins
and publishing information easy — and some crafty and creative developers 
have designed easy-to-use plugins for WordPress that help people sell products 
on their websites.
Understanding what you can do  
with e-commerce plugins
E-commerce plugins add features to your WordPress installation that allow 
you to
	
✓	Create a dedicated store of product listings.
	
✓	Upload and display product images.
	
✓	Attach prices to each product.
	
✓	Provide inventory tracking.
	
✓	Include payment gateways, such as PayPal or Google Checkout, to make 
it easy for visitors to purchase items directly from your website.
	
✓	Configure sales tax and shipping rates.
	
✓	And more. . . .
Some examples of the types of products people use WordPress e-commerce 
plugins to sell are
	
✓	Physical products: Jewelry, clothing, or digital equipment
	
✓	Downloadable products: E-books or software, such as plugins
	
✓	Memberships: Clubs, societies, or members-only websites
Examining some recommended plugins
When I get a request from a client to build an e-commerce website using  
WordPress, I look at four plugins to provide the solution: Cart66, WooCommerce, 
WP e-Commerce, and Shopp. These four plugins all accomplish the task of 
building an e-commerce website, and each plugin differs in the way the store 
gets built. I don’t have a preference of one over the other, and I usually stick 
with the platform I’m most comfortable with or the one I think may be easiest 
for my clients to use, depending on their skill levels.
Cart66
Cart66 (http://cart66.com) is an easy-to-use e-commerce solution that 
plugs into an existing WordPress theme with minimal tweaking required to 
get it to display correctly. You can sell physical or digital products, manage 
orders, sell subscriptions for members-only websites, and manage affiliates. 
This plugin isn’t free; you must purchase and download it from the Cart66 

318
Part IV: Building Your Custom Website 
website, and pricing starts at $89. The Cart66 plugin requires manual instal-
lation via FTP (see the section “Manually Installing Plugins,” earlier in this 
chapter).
Figure 16-6 shows a jewelry website (http://halliefriedman.com) I cre-
ated for a client with Cart66.
With Cart66, follow these steps to create a store:
	
1.	Install and activate the Cart66 plugin via FTP.
	
2.	Configure the settings on the Cart66 Options page on your Dashboard 
(choose Cart66➪Settings) for your preferred shipping, payment, and 
shop management.
	
3.	Add products, including project images and prices, in the Products 
interface (choose Cart66➪Products).
	
4.	Create a new post or page in WordPress about your product.
	
5.	Add the product info from the shop to your post by using the Add 
Product feature that Cart66 has added to the post editor.

 Chapter 16: Enhancing Your Website with Plugins
WooCommerce
The WooCommerce plugin (www.woothemes.com/woocommerce/) is a tool-
kit for WordPress that helps you sell anything on your website. The primary 
WooCommerce plugin is free to download, and after you have it installed, 
you can browse a full selection of extensions to add specific features to the 
WooCommerce plugin, such as
	
✓	Accounting extensions
	
✓	Marketing extensions
	
✓	Payment gateway extensions
	
✓	Reporting extensions
	
✓	Shipping extensions
You can either download the WooCommerce plugin from the WooCommerce 
website or install it via the Plugins page on your WordPress Dashboard. The 
extensions, however, aren’t free — they must be purchased and downloaded 
via the WooCommerce website.
This plugin works well with a multisite setup in WordPress (which allows mul-
tiple sites to be created in a single installation of WordPress) and with the 
BuddyPress social community plugin (which I cover later in this chapter). 
WooCommerce also makes it easy to spotlight different areas of your store, 
or individual products, with shop-specific widgets and short codes.
WP e-Commerce
The WP e-Commerce (www.instinct.co.nz/e-commerce) plugin is freely 
available on the Plugin Directory page at http://wordpress.org/extend/
plugins/wp-e-commerce. You can use the free version to sell products, 
manage sales and inventory, and run a full shop on your website; however, 
Instinct Entertainment, the developers behind the plugin, also have commer-
cial upgrades available for purchase in their shop at http://getshopped.
org/extend/premium-upgrades. The upgrades address further needs, as 
described in the following list:
	
✓	Gold Cart: Extends the WP e-Commerce plugin by providing additional 
features, such as galleries, store searches, multiple image uploads, and 
additional payment gateway providers. Cost: $47.00.
	
✓	Affiliate Plugin: Helps manage affiliates for your product sales. Cost: $47.00.
	
✓	DropShop: Creates a beautiful drag-and-drop shopping interface where 
visitors can simply click and drag a product to the shopping cart for  
purchase. Cost: $117.00.
The WP e-Commerce plugin is a bit more challenging when integrating the 
shop and product pages into your existing WordPress theme, because it has 

320
Part IV: Building Your Custom Website 
its own set of templates that need to be configured and styled to coordinate 
well with your existing website design.
Figure 16-7 displays the dvDepot website (http://dvdepot.com), which 
sells DVD- and video-recording equipment via the WP e-Commerce plugin.
Figure 16-7: A site that uses the WP e-Commerce plugin.
Shopp
Shopp (http://shopplugin.net) adds a feature-rich online store to your 
WordPress website with the installation of its plugin. Shopp costs $55 for 
single-user access and $299 for developer access. Shopp also has several 
upgrades you can purchase for $25 each for various payment gateways, ship-
ping add-ons, storage engine add-ons, and priority support credits.
The Shopp plugin website states that the plugin works out of the box with 
no theme adjustments necessary; however, in my experience, theme adjust-
ments are required in most cases. Other features include
	
✓	Theme widgets for shop-related items, such as featured and random 
products and product categories
	
✓	Multiple product images

321
 Chapter 16: Enhancing Your Website with Plugins
	
✓	Product categorization, allowing you to create multiple category levels 
for your products (as you’d do for your posts on a WordPress blog)
	
✓	Product searches
	
✓	And more . . .
Creating Photo Galleries or Portfolios
This section covers how to include photo galleries on your site, which are 
useful for anyone who needs to include a gallery or portfolio of visual design 
work, such as web designers and logo designers. I’ve even produced a few 
websites with galleries for bakeries whose owners want to display their cake 
decorations or chefs who want to display a photo gallery highlighting their 
yummy food creations!
You can display a photo gallery on your website in a couple ways. One way 
is to use the built-in gallery feature in WordPress. The other way is to use a 
robust photo gallery plugin that allows you to create albums with galleries,  
in case you need a more complex solution.
Inserting images into your page or post
Before you create a photo gallery with the built-in gallery feature in 
WordPress, you need to understand how to add images to a post or page 
you’ve created. Adding images to a post or page is pretty easy with the 
WordPress image uploader (via the Add an Image dialog box). You can add 
images in two ways: from a location on the web or from your computer.
Adding an image from a URL
Follow these steps to add an image to your page (or post) from a URL:
	
1.	From the Dashboard, choose Pages➪Add New to add an image to  
your page. If you want to insert the image in a blog post, choose 
Posts➪Add New.
	
	 The Add New Page page (or Add New Post page) appears.
	
2.	Click the Add Media button.
	
	 The Insert Media dialog box opens, enabling you to choose images from 
your hard drive or from a location on the web (see Figure 16-8).
	
3.	Click the Insert from URL link in the Insert Media dialog box.
	
	 The Insert from URL window opens.

322
Part IV: Building Your Custom Website 
Figure 16-8: The WordPress Insert Media dialog box.
	
4.	Type the URL of the image in the text box.
	
	Type the full URL, including the http:// and www. portions of the 
address. You can find the URL of any image on the web by right-clicking 
(Windows) or Control-clicking (Mac) and then choosing Properties.
	
5.	Type a title for the image in the Title text box, and then type a descrip-
tion of the image in the Alt Text text box.
	
	 The alternative text (or ALT tags) is what appears in a browser if, for 
some reason, the image doesn’t load properly; it gives the visitor to your 
site a description of the image. Adding alternative text is also a good 
SEO (search engine optimization) practice because it gives the search 
engines, such as Google, additional descriptive text that helps them 
further categorize and define your site in their search engine listings 
and directories. (I discuss search engine optimization in more detail in 
Chapter 15.)
	
6.	(Optional) Type the image caption in the Caption text box.
	
	The words you type in the text box display as a caption below the image 
on your site. (WordPress automatically adds a class called wp-caption 
in the markup — you can use this class in the CSS to provide a style for 
the image captions on your site.)

323
 Chapter 16: Enhancing Your Website with Plugins
	
7.	Choose an alignment option by selecting None, Left, Center, or Right.
	
8.	Select the URL you want the image linked to.
	
	 Whatever option you choose determines where your readers go when 
they click the image you’ve uploaded:
	
•	None: Readers can’t click the image.
	
•	Image URL: Readers can click through to the direct image itself.
	
•	Custom URL: Readers can click through to a URL you designate.
	
9.	Click the Insert into Page (or Insert into Post) button.
	
	 The HTML markup for the image is inserted into the body of your page 
or post.
Adding an image from your computer
To add an image from your own hard drive to your page or post, follow these 
steps:
	
1.	Follow Steps 1 and 2 in the preceding section.
	
	 The Insert Media dialog box appears (refer to Figure 16-8).
	
2.	In the Insert Media dialog box, click the Select Files button.
	
	 A dialog box opens from which you can select images from your hard drive.
	
3.	Select one or more images, and then click Open.
	
	 The images you select are uploaded from your computer to your web 
server. WordPress displays a progress bar during the upload and then 
displays the Image Options dialog box when the upload is finished.
	
4.	Edit the details of each image by clicking on the image thumbnail.
	
	 A box that contains several image options appears on the right side, as 
shown in Figure 16-9.
	
5.	Fill in the following information about each image:
	
•	Title: Type a title for the image.
	
•	Caption: Type a caption (such as This is a flower from my garden) 
for the image.
	
•	Alt Text: Type the alternative text (as described in the preceding 
section) for the image.
	
•	Description: Type a description of the image.
	
•	Alignment: Choose None, Left, Center, or Right. (See Table 16-1, in 
the following section, for styling information regarding image  
alignment.)

324
Part IV: Building Your Custom Website 
Figure 16-9: You can set several options for your images after you upload them.
	
•	Link To: Type the URL you want the image linked to. Whatever 
option you choose determines where your readers go when they 
click the image you’ve uploaded: Click None to prevent the image 
from being clickable; Media URL to let readers click through to the 
direct image; Attachment Page to let readers click through to the 
post that the image appears in; and Custom URL to let them type 
their own URLs in the Custom URL text box.
	
•	Size: Choose Thumbnail, Medium, Large, or Full Size.
	
	WordPress automatically creates small- and medium-size versions 
of the images you upload through the built-in image uploader. A 
thumbnail is a smaller version of the original file. You can edit the 
size of the thumbnail by choosing Settings➪Media. In the Image 
Sizes section, designate the height and width of the small and 
medium thumbnail images generated by WordPress.
	
	 If you’re uploading more than one image, skip the rest of the steps in 
this list and head to the “Inserting a photo gallery” section, later in this 
chapter.
	
6.	(Optional) Click the Edit Image link (to the right of the thumbnail of 
the image) to edit the appearance of each image.
	
	 The Edit Media page appears, as shown in Figure 16-10.

325
 Chapter 16: Enhancing Your Website with Plugins
Figure 16-10: The WordPress image editor options.
	
	 These buttons are shown across the top of the image editor on the Edit 
Media page:
	
•	Crop: Click this button to cut the image down to a smaller size.
	
•	Rotate Counter-Clockwise: Click this button to rotate the image to 
the left.
	
•	Rotate Clockwise: Click this button to rotate the image to the right.
	
•	Flip Vertically: Click this button to flip the image upside down and 
back again.
	
•	Flip Horizontally: Click this button to flip the image from right to 
left and back again.
	
•	Undo: Click this button to undo any changes you’ve made.
	
•	Redo: Click this button to redo image edits that you’ve undone.
	
•	Scale Image: Click this button to open the drop-down menu that 
lets you set a specific width and height for the image.
	
7.	After you set the options for the image you’ve uploaded, click the 
Update button to save your changes.
	
	 You return to the Insert Media page.

326
Part IV: Building Your Custom Website 
	
8.	Click the Insert into Page button in the lower-right corner.
	
	 In HTML view, you can see that WordPress has inserted the HTML code 
to display the image(s) on your page, as shown in Figure 16-11; you can 
continue editing your page, save it, or publish it.
	
	 To see the image and not the code, click the Visual tab that’s just above 
the text box.
Figure 16-11: WordPress inserts the correct HTML code for your uploaded image into the page.
Adding image styles to your stylesheet
When you upload an image (as I describe in the previous sections of this 
chapter), you can set the alignment for the image as None, Left, Center, or 
Right. The WordPress theme you’re using, however, may not have these 
alignment styles accounted for in its stylesheet. If you set the alignment to 
Left, for example, but the image on the page doesn’t appear to be aligned, 
you may need to add a few styles to your theme’s stylesheet.
I discuss themes and templates in great detail in Part III of this book. For the 
purposes of ensuring that you choose the correct alignment for your newly 
uploaded images, however, here’s a quick-and-dirty method:

327
 Chapter 16: Enhancing Your Website with Plugins
	
1.	From the Dashboard, choose Appearance➪Editor.
	
	 The Edit Themes page opens. All the template files for your active theme 
are listed on the right side of the page.
	
2.	Click the Stylesheet template.
	
	 The Stylesheet (style.css) template opens in the text box in the 
center of the page.
	
3.	Add your desired styles to the stylesheet.
	
	 Table 16-1 shows the styles you can add to your stylesheet to ensure 
that image-alignment styling is present and accounted for in your theme. 
These styles are only examples of what you can do. Get creative with 
your styling. You can find more information in Chapter 14 about using 
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) to add style to your theme.
Table 16-1	
Styling Techniques for Image Alignment
Image Alignment
Add This to Your Stylesheet (style.css)
None
img.alignnone {float:none; margin:  
5px 0 5px 0;}
Left
img.alignleft {float:left; margin:  
5px 10px 5px 0px;}
Center
img.aligncenter {display:block; 
float:none; margin: 5px auto;}
Right
img.alignright {float:right; margin:  
5px 0 5px 10px;}
Inserting a photo gallery
You can also use the WordPress Insert Media page to insert a full photo gal-
lery into your pages (or posts). Follow these steps to insert a photo gallery 
into a page (or post):
	
1.	On the page (or post) in which you want to insert a gallery, upload 
your images by following the steps in the earlier section “Adding an 
image from a URL” or “Adding an image from your computer.”
	
2.	On the Add New Page (or Add New Post) page, click the Add Media 
button.
	
	 The Insert Media dialog box appears.

328
Part IV: Building Your Custom Website 
	
3.	Click the Create Gallery link on the left side of the Insert Media  
dialog box.
	
	 The Gallery tab appears only for posts or pages that have one or more 
images uploaded.
	
	 This tab displays thumbnails of all the images you’ve uploaded for your 
page (or post). Figure 16-12 shows that I have six images uploaded and 
attached to the page.
Figure 16-12: The gallery of images within the Insert Media dialog box.
	
4.	Click the Create a New Gallery button.
	
	 This step opens the Edit Gallery page, where you can drag and drop the 
images to determine the order in which they should appear on your site.
	
5.	In the Gallery Settings section, set the display options for your gallery:
	
•	Link To: Select Media File (the physical image file) or Attachment 
Page (a page that displays only the image itself).
	
•	Random Order: Select this option to make the images appear in

•	Columns: Select how many columns of images you want to display 
in your gallery.

6.	Click the Insert Gallery button at the bottom of the dialog box.
	
	 WordPress returns to the Add New Page (or Add New Post) page. You 
can see that WordPress has inserted into your page (or post) a piece 
of short code (a snippet of code that WordPress uses to execute certain 
functions, such as the gallery display) that looks like this:
[gallery]
	
	 Note: You have to switch to HTML view (click the HTML tab) to see this 
code.
	
	 Table 16-2 shows some gallery short codes that you can use to manually 
set the display settings for your photo gallery.
	
7.	(Optional) In the Page (or Post) edit box in HTML view, you can change 
the order of appearance of the images in the gallery, as well as the 
markup (HTML tags or CSS selectors), by entering the following short 
code:
	
	 captiontag: Changes the markup that surrounds the image caption by 
altering the gallery short code. For example,
[gallery captiontag=”div”]
	
	places <div></div> tags around the image caption. (The <div> tag, 
which is considered a block-level element, creates a separate container 
for the content.)
	
	 To have the gallery appear on a line of its own, use the following code:
[gallery captiontag=”p”]
	
	 This code places <p class=”gallery-caption”></p> tags around 
the image caption. The default markup for the captiontag option is dd.
	
	 icontag: Defines the HTML markup around each individual thumbnail 
image in your gallery. Change the markup around the icontag (thumb-
nail icon) of the image by altering the gallery short code to look some-
thing like this:
[gallery icontag=”p”]
	
	 This code places <p class=”gallery-icon”></p> tags around each 
thumbnail icon. The default markup for icontag is dt.
	
	 itemtag: Defines the HTML markup around each item in your gallery. 
Change the markup around the itemtag (each item) in the gallery by 
altering the gallery short code to look something like this:
[gallery itemtag=”span”]
	
	 This code places <span class=”gallery-item”></span> tags around 
each item in the gallery. The default markup for the itemtag is dl.

330
Part IV: Building Your Custom Website 
	
	 orderby: Defines the order that the images display within your gallery. 
Change the order used to display the thumbnails in the gallery by alter-
ing the gallery short code to look something like this:
[gallery orderby=”menu_order ASC”]
	
	 This code displays the thumbnails in ascending menu order. Another 
parameter you can use is ID_order ASC, which displays the thumb-
nails in ascending order according to their IDs.
	
8.	When you’re finished, click the Preview button to preview your 
changes; when you’re satisfied, click the Publish button to publish 
your page.

Gallery Short Code Examples
Gallery Short Code
Output
[gallery columns=”4”

A four-column gallery containing 
medium-size images
[gallery columns=”10” 
id=”215” size=”thumbnail”]
A ten-column gallery containing 
thumbnail images pulled from the blog 
post with the ID 215
[gallery captiontag=”p” 
icontag=”span”]
A three-column (default) gallery in 
which each image is surrounded by 
<span></span> tags and the image 
caption is surrounded by <p></p> tags
Follow these steps to edit the stylesheet for your theme to include the gallery 
styles in the CSS:
	
1.	From the Dashboard, choose Appearance➪Themes➪Editor and then 
open your CSS stylesheet.
	
2.	Define the style of the <span> tags in your stylesheet.
	
	 The <span> tags create an inline element. An element contained within 
a <span> tag stays on the same line as the element before it; there’s no 
line break. You need a little knowledge of CSS to alter the <span> tags. 
Here’s an example of what you can add to the stylesheet (style.css) 
for your current theme to define the style of the <span> tags:
span.gallery-icon img {
padding: 3px;
background: white;
border: 1px solid black;
margin: 0 5px;
}

331
 Chapter 16: Enhancing Your Website with Plugins
	
	 Placing this bit of CSS in the stylesheet (style.css) of your active 
theme automatically places a 1-pixel black border around each thumb-
nail, with 3 pixels of padding and a white background. The left and right 
margins are 5 pixels wide, creating nice spacing between images in the 
gallery. (See Chapter 14 for more on CSS.)
	
3.	Click the Update File button to save changes to your Stylesheet 
(style.css) template.
Figure 16-13 shows a page with my photo gallery displayed, using the preced-
ing steps and the CSS example in the default Twenty Thirteen theme. Here’s 
the gallery short code that I used for the gallery shown in Figure 16-13:

feature. See the nearby sidebar, “WordPress gallery plugins.”

Part IV: Building Your Custom Website 
Creating Web Forms for Your Site with Plugins
Some website owners need to provide a way for their visitors to contact them 
directly via e-mail. You don’t want to publish your actual e-mail address on 
your website, because people run special programs — called bots or spiders —  
that travel around the Internet and collect published e-mail addresses. After 
these programs collect hundreds, thousands, or even millions of e-mail 
addresses, they create a database of user e-mail addresses and sell them to 
marketing companies. That’s how a lot of people end up with gobs of spam in 
their inboxes!
	
If at all possible, never, ever publish your e-mail address directly on your 
website. Instead, use an easy form that your website visitors can fill out to 
e-mail you. Figure 16-14 shows an example of an e-mail contact form that I use 
on my personal website at http://lisasabin-wilson.com/contact.
Using this contact form on my website, visitors to my site can go to that 
page, fill out their information — including their names, e-mail addresses, 
subjects, and messages to me — and then click the Submit button. From 
there, their messages are delivered to my e-mail address. I can respond 
directly to messages while keeping all e-mail addresses private and away 
from the prying eyes of spam bots and spiders.
In the following sections, I describe some other types of forms you can create 
and recommend plugins you may want to use to create forms for your site.
WordPress gallery plugins
Here are a handful of helpful, free plugins that 
you can find on the WordPress Plugin Directory 
page and install automatically from within your 
Dashboard:
	✓	NextGEN Gallery: This plugin creates sort-
able photo galleries and offers a display 
of random and recent thumbnail images 
in your sidebar through the use of wid-
gets, and more. You can download it at 
http://wordpress.org/extend/
plugins/nextgen-gallery.
	✓	Organizer: Use this plugin to organize, 
rename, resize, and manage files in your 
image-upload folder. You can download it at 
http://wordpress.org/extend/
plugins/organizer.
	✓	Random Image Widget: This plugin lets you 
display a random image from your image-
upload folder. You can download it at 
http://wordpress.org/extend/
plugins/random-image-widget.
	✓	Mini-Slides: Use this plugin to create inline 
slideshows from your uploaded images. 
You can download it at http://word 
press.org/extend/plugins/
mini-slides.

Exploring different types of forms  
you can use on your site
The e-mail contact form is a simple example of a form you can build and 
include on your WordPress website using the plugins that I list in the next 
section. However, you can build several other kinds of forms to help fulfill  
the individual needs of your website. Here are some examples of forms you 
can build and display on your website:
	
✓	Order forms: Collect the information you need from your customers 
by creating an order form with the necessary fields that they complete 
before sending the form to you. You can find an example of an order 
form I use on my business website at http://webdevstudios.com/
contact. Potential clients who are interested in receiving project quotes 
from my company are asked to fill in different types of fields (such as their 
budget and site specifications) so that I can collect pertinent information 
about their needs.
	
✓	Surveys: Ask customers to review your product or services, or provide 
testimonials for your business.

334
Part IV: Building Your Custom Website 
	
✓	Lead-generation forms: Collect information on your readership and 
customer base. This form is the opt-in type (people fill it out only if they 
want to, so it’s not considered spam), and it allows you to build a data-
base of contacts to send updates and newsletters to.
Helpful plugins to create forms
I consider two plugins to be my go-to options when I need to create forms for 
my clients’ websites: Contact Form 7 (available on the Plugin Directory page) 
and Gravity Forms (a commercial plugin).
Contact Form 7
The Contact Form 7 plugin (http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/
contact-form-7) provides a quick-and-easy solution to include a simple 
e-mail contact form on your site. This plugin, freely available from the Plugin 
Directory page, can be installed from the Dashboard. To do so:
	
1.	Choose Plugins➪Add New to go to the Install Plugins page in your 
Dashboard, and then type Contact Form 7 in the search box to find the 
plugin.
	
2.	Follow the instructions in the section “Installing WordPress Plugins 
via the Dashboard,” earlier in this chapter, to install and activate the 
plugin.
	
	After the plugin is activated, the Contact menu item is added to the 
Dashboard menu.
	
3.	Click Contact to go to an option page where you can build the contact 
form and get the short code to add it to a page within your site.
	
	 Figure 16-15 shows you the Contact Form 7 page on the Dashboard, and 
you can find the short code to include in your page at the top:
[contact-form 1 “Contact form 1”]
	
4.	Copy that short code, and then add it into any page where you want to 
display the contact form on your site.
	
	 You can even paste the code into a text widget to include the form in 
your sidebar.
Gravity Forms
Gravity Forms (www.gravityforms.com) is a commercially available plugin 
for WordPress that’s much more robust than Contact Form 7 (described in 
the preceding section). If you need a more integrated solution with several 
tools to help you build different types of forms, get a more complex plugin 
like Gravity Forms. This plugin not only allows you to include a simple e-mail 
form but also provides additional features that make it a primary solution for 
many designers and developers.

335
 Chapter 16: Enhancing Your Website with Plugins
Figure 16-15: The Contact Form 7 Dashboard page.
This list describes some of the features of Gravity Forms:
	
✓	An easy-to-use, click-and-add form builder — no need to know, or even 
understand, any HTML, CSS, or PHP code. Figure 16-16 displays the 
Gravity Forms Editor page within my Dashboard (choose Forms➪Edit 
Forms) on my personal site. The form fields are all ready for you 
to simply click and add to your new form — no HTML, PHP, or CSS 
required, because it’s all done for you.
	
✓	Multiple e-mail routing that allows you to not only have the form results 
e-mailed to you but also designate multiple e-mail addresses that the 
form should be delivered to.
	
✓	Conditional form fields that allow you to build forms that are intuitive. 
You can show or hide a form field based on the value the user enters in 
previous fields within the form.
	
✓	Form scheduling that’s helpful if you have a form you want to make 
available only during a certain, predefined period.

336
Part IV: Building Your Custom Website 
Figure 16-16: The Gravity Forms Editor page.
	
✓	Form limits that allow you to limit the number of times the form can be 
filled out before it’s deactivated. This feature is helpful if you’re running 
a time-sensitive contest, for example, where the first 25 people to fill out 
the form win a special prize. The form is then deactivated after it’s been 
filled out by 25 people.
	
✓	Dashboard management that allows you to view and respond to the 
results of the form from a designated page within your WordPress 
Dashboard.
	
✓	Easily embed a form within a page (or post) on your website by using 
the Gravity Forms icon that’s added to the Edit Page, and Edit Post, edi-
tors. Click the icon and choose the form you want to embed, and then 
WordPress enters the correct short code for the display of the form on 
your site.
	
✓	Integration with MailChimp, a popular provider for e-newsletters that 
many businesses and individuals use. Gravity Forms makes a MailChimp 
add-on available to allow your site visitors to easily subscribe to your 
e-newsletter when they fill out forms on your website.
Because Gravity Forms is a commercially available plugin, you download 
it from the Gravity Forms website and then manually install it on your 
WordPress site via FTP. (See the section “Manually Installing Plugins,” earlier 
in this chapter.) You can purchase Gravity Forms from www.gravityforms.
com; pricing starts at $39 for a single site license and increases to $199 for a 
developer license. The prices listed on the site are annual prices, so plan to 
pay the annual subscription to maintain your access to future upgrades and 
support from the Gravity Forms developers.

Building a Social Community with BuddyPress
The popularity of online social communities is undeniable. WordPress — the 
creator of the world’s most popular blogging platform — is a great example 
of an online social community, allowing millions of users all over the globe to 
freely publish content on the Internet and invite others to join the discussion.
The BuddyPress plugin, introduced to the WordPress community in 2008, was the 
next logical step, enabling bloggers to expand their websites to include a social 
community for their visitors to participate in. BuddyPress can be installed and 
activated from within your WordPress Dashboard — just search for BuddyPress 
on the Install Plugins page (choose Plugins➪Add New), and then install and 
activate it (see “Installing and activating a plugin,” earlier in this chapter).
BuddyPress allows you to create a similar type of social community on your 
own WordPress-powered website, and it helps you take your existing website 
to the next level by allowing your visitors to become members. A BuddyPress 
social community gives its members a handful of core features that are easy 
to set up and allows them to immediately connect with other members of the 
community. Members can have extensive profiles that contain personal, bio-
graphical information that allows other members to find out more about them. 
Members share with other members any information they want, from personal 
information and news to website links, photos, videos, music, and more.
BuddyPress is an extensive suite of plugins that allows you to create the  
following features within your social community:
	
✓	Extended member profiles: Include shared personal information about 
each member of your community.
	
✓	Member avatars: Allow your members to upload unique, personal photos.
	
✓	Member and site activity streams: Provide a listing of member actions 
and activities throughout your community.
	
✓	Activity wires: Create a place where members can leave comments and 
messages for other members and groups in a public manner.
	
✓	Member groups: Let community members gather in groups based on 
topics and interests.
	
✓	Member forums: Let members create and participate in topic-related 
discussions with other members.
	
✓	Blog tracking: Provides a listing of blog activity throughout your com-
munity, including new blog posts and comments.
	
✓	Searchable member, blog, and group directories: Let you search 
member lists, group lists, and blogs to find specific information.
	
✓	Member status updates: Provide short but sweet updates about what 
members are doing now that they can share.

338
Part IV: Building Your Custom Website 
	
You may find that you don’t want or need to use all the features that 
BuddyPress offers, and that’s okay. You don’t have to use them just because 
they exist. BuddyPress allows you to use only what you need — you can even 
delete extraneous features if you don’t want to use them — enabling you to 
tailor your BuddyPress community to your liking.
If you want to take the interactivity on your website a few steps further, you 
can build a social community where visitors to your website can create a 
membership and become part of the content and conversation. In addition to 
leaving comments about articles, members can write their own articles, share 
more information, and participate in your site as a full contributor rather 
than just a visitor. Members can benefit from networking and connecting 
with other members within the community as well.
Here are a few examples of the types of communities I’m talking about, all 
built with the BuddyPress/WordPress platform:
	
✓	Tasty Kitchen: An active social community of members who like to cook, 
as shown in Figure 16-17 (http://tastykitchen.com)
Figure 16-17: A WordPress site with a BuddyPress community.

339
 Chapter 16: Enhancing Your Website with Plugins
	
✓	GigaOM Pro: A network of analysts providing technology-related 
research papers and notes (http://pro.gigaom.com)
	
✓	TDI Truth & Dare: By Volkswagen, a network of VW TDI drivers working 
to make a world-record mileage score (http://tdi.vw.com)
Whether your business is large or small, you can benefit from adding a social 
community component to your website by being able to invite your custom-
ers or prospects to participate in the discussion about their businesses.
	
If you’re wondering whether the BuddyPress plugin is right for you, head 
over to the official BuddyPress Test Drive site at http://testbp.org. The 
site was put together by the BuddyPress developers for the sole purpose of 
giving people an opportunity to test-drive the features and components that 
are available in the BuddyPress plugin. Many times, when clients approach 
me and inquire about adding the BuddyPress plugin to their websites, I first 
send them to the BuddyPress Test Drive site to find out more about the 
plugin and to experience its features and components. After they’ve done all 
that, they can decide whether they want to use BuddyPress on their sites.
Using Plugins to Integrate Popular  
Social Networks with Your Blog
To continue the social community theme from the preceding section, this 
section introduces you to some great plugins that help you integrate your 
involvement in other social networks into your WordPress website. Having 
one website published on the Internet isn’t enough: Many companies, indi-
viduals, celebrities, and news organizations are also involved in popular 
social networks, such as Twitter or Facebook, to increase their exposure and 
presence online.
I’ll bet you have a profile page on at least one of these two social networks —  
am I right? There are several easy ways to integrate your social network 
membership into your WordPress website by using plugins that help your 
readers also connect with you on those networks. The two social networks I 
talk about in the following sections are the most popular: Twitter (http://
twitter.com) and Facebook (www.facebook.com).
Integrating Twitter with Twitter Tools
An easy and effective way to integrate Twitter into your WordPress website 
is to connect your site to your Twitter account. That way, whenever you 
publish a new post on your website, the new post gets broadcasted to your 

340
Part IV: Building Your Custom Website 
Twitter account to make it easy for your Twitter followers to click through 
and read it.
Twitter Tools, a plugin developed by Crowd Favorite, provides you with an 
easy interface to accomplish this task. Twitter Tools, freely available on the 
Plugin Directory page, can be installed and activated from your WordPress 
Dashboard (as I describe in the earlier section “Installing WordPress Plugins 
via the Dashboard”).
After Twitter Tools is activated on your site, choose Settings➪Twitter Tools 
from your Dashboard. The Twitter Tools Options page displays, and you 
can configure a few settings to get it connected to your Twitter account and 
working on your site.
Follow the directions on the Twitter Tools Options page to connect your 
WordPress website to your Twitter account, which involves registering your 
website on Twitter’s application registration page. After you register your 
website with Twitter, you receive a Twitter consumer key, a consumer secret 
key, an access key, and an access token secret key to insert in the required 
fields on the Twitter Tools Options page.
After you complete the Twitter registration, the Twitter Tools Options page 
changes and provides you with a series of settings that you need to configure 
for your website. Here’s what happens when you enable these settings:
	
✓	Enable Option to Create a Tweet When You Publish a New Post on 
Your Blog: Posts from your WordPress blog are published to your 
Twitter account.
	
✓	Prefix for New Blog Posts on Twitter: Set how your blog post titles are 
posted to your Twitter account. My blog post titles are prefixed with the 
text New Post: — you can configure it to say whatever you want.
	
✓	Create a New Blog Post from Each of Your Tweets: Your tweets are not 
only listed on your Twitter account but are also saved to your blog in 
the form of blog posts.
	
✓	Create Tweets from Your Sidebar: Your Twitter account is updated 
directly from your website.
Integrating Facebook with Wordbooker
Facebook is another social network where you interact with a group of 
friends and followers, so updating your Facebook Page with new posts from 
your blog is a great way to keep your Facebook friends up to date on the con-
tent you publish on your website.

341
 Chapter 16: Enhancing Your Website with Plugins
Wordbooker, a nifty (and free!) plugin, provides you with an easy tool to pub-
lish posts from your blog to your Facebook profile page. Aside from sharing 
new blog posts on your Facebook profile, the Wordbooker plugin includes 
several other features to further integrate your website with your Facebook 
account; here are a few:
	
✓	Facebook Like: A Facebook Like button is inserted within every blog 
post on your site, allowing your readers to click it to publish on their 
Facebook Pages a blurb that they liked your post — bringing (you hope!) 
their friends to your website.
	
✓	Include Faces: For readers who like your post, their photos (or faces) 
display on your blog post to personalize it a bit for your readers.
	
✓	Import Comments from Facebook: When your blog post is published on 
your Facebook Page, your friends can leave comments on it in Facebook. 
Those comments are then imported into your post on your WordPress 
website — so that you have them visible in both places!
	
✓	Push Comments to Facebook: When people leave comments on the post 
on your website, those comments are then pushed, or published, into 
the comments area on your Facebook page.
	
✓	Facebook Share: A small button, visible within every post, allows visitors 
to your site to share your article on their Facebook Pages.

Ten Powerful Plugins for 
WordPress
In This Chapter
▶	Enhancing search engine optimization
▶	Displaying your site in mobile browsers
▶	Enhancing your site’s security
▶	Tracking your visitors and stats
I
 
n this chapter, I list ten of the most popular plugins available for your 
WordPress site. This list isn’t exhaustive by any means; hundreds of excellent 
WordPress plugins can, and do, provide multiple ways to extend the functional-
ity of your site. If these ten plugins aren’t enough for you, you can find many 
more on the WordPress Plugin Directory page (http://wordpress.org/
extend/plugins).
In Chapter 16, I explain how to install plugins, and I recommend some plugins 
you can use to extend the functionality and feature set of your site by creat-
ing e-commerce stores, photo galleries, social communities, and discussion 
forums. This chapter gives you ten plugins that should be present in almost 
every WordPress installation you do.
All in One SEO Pack
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/all-in-one-seo-pack
Almost every website owner is concerned about search engine optimization 
(SEO). Good SEO practices help the major search engines (Google, Yahoo!, 
and Bing) easily find and cache your site content in their search databases 
so that when people search using keywords, they can find your site in the 
search results. The All in One SEO Pack plugin helps you fine-tune your site 
to make that happen; it automatically creates optimized titles and generates 
HTML keywords for your individual posts and pages. If you’re a beginner, this 

346
Part V: The Part of Tens 
plugin works for you right out of the box with no advanced configuration. 
Woohoo! If you’re an advanced user, you can fine-tune the All in One SEO  
settings to your liking.
BackupBuddy
http://ithemes.com/purchase/backupbuddy
Starting at $45 for the personal user and $197 for the entire development suite 
of plugins, the folks at PluginBuddy have hit a home run with BackupBuddy, 
which lets you back up your entire WordPress website in minutes.
With this plugin, you can also determine a schedule of automated backups of 
your site on a daily, weekly, monthly, and so on basis. You can store those 
backups on your web server, e-mail backups to a designated e-mail address, 
or store the backups in Amazon’s Simple Storage Service, if you have an 
account there.
BackupBuddy backs up not only your WordPress data (posts, pages, comments, 
and so on) but also any theme and customized plugins you’ve installed (includ-
ing all the settings for those plugins). It even saves and backs up all WordPress 
settings and any widgets that you’re currently using. BackupBuddy also includes 
an import and migration script (importbuddy.php) that allows you to easily 
transfer an existing site to a new domain, or new host, within minutes. 
This plugin is invaluable for designers and developers who work with clients 
to design websites with WordPress. In Chapter 8, I discuss how you can set 
up a development environment on your local computer to work on client sites.
WP-Print
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-print
WP-Print is an easy-to-use plugin that provides a clean, printable version of 
your blog posts and pages. Unless your theme has a specialized stylesheet 
for printing, posts and pages print rather messily. WP-Print strips most of the 
style from your theme design (images and formatting, for example) and out-
puts a clean print of your article with black text on a white background.
You can configure these options for the plugin:
	
✓	Print Text Link for Post: This option configures a Print This Post link.
	
✓	Print Text Link for Page: This option configures a Print This Page link.

347
 Chapter 17: Ten Powerful Plugins for WordPress
	
✓	Print Icon: Choose between two available icon designs: print.gif and 
printer_fam fam fam.gif. The icon you choose appears on your site.
	
✓	Print Text Style Link: This drop-down list presents settings for display-
ing the print link on your site.
	
✓	Additional printing options: You can specify whether comments, links, 
images, video, and disclaimer or copyright text prints.
WP-Print doesn’t automatically appear on your site. You need to add a small 
snippet of code to your template in the area where you want the print link to 
appear with The Loop (see Chapter 11 for information about The Loop):
<?php if(function_exists(‘wp_print’)) { print_link(); } ?>
PluginBuddy Mobile
http://ithemes.com/purchase/mobile/
PluginBuddy Mobile is a premium WordPress plugin that starts at $45; how-
ever, it’s worth every penny. This plugin adds a feature set and functionality 
to your website by creating a mobile-ready version that displays correctly in 
many major mobile web browsers, such as iPhone, BlackBerry, and Android 
devices.
PluginBuddy Mobile is easy to install and gives your website a professional 
mobile-ready theme within minutes. After you purchase and download the 
plugin, install it on your WordPress site (just like you would any WordPress 
plugin, as I discuss in Chapter 16). The primary features of PluginBuddy 
Mobile are:
	
✓	Mobile Theme Style Manager: Easily create and adjust your own mobile 
theme for the website you’re building with WordPress.
	
✓	Custom Header Uploader: Include a header image that you designed to 
individualize your website’s mobile theme.
	
✓	Mobile Support for Multiple Platforms: Assign different themes to dif-
ferent mobile platforms (iPhone, Blackberry, Android, and so on).
	
✓	Mobile Starter Theme: Three themes help get you started; you can use 
them as is or use the Mobile Theme Style Manager to customize them to 
suit your needs.
	
✓	WordPress 3.0 Custom Navigation: Supports the Custom Menu 
Navigation feature built in to WordPress (which I describe in detail in 
Chapter 10).

ShareThis
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/share-this
Every social media service has its own icon. People put these icons on their 
sites to let their visitors know that they can share the content with each 
social media service. This was a good concept when only a handful of ser-
vices existed, but now there are dozens.
ShareThis allows visitors to share content through e-mail and popular social 
media services, such as Technorati, Delicious, and Digg. After you install the 
plugin, go to the Options page for ShareThis (choose Settings➪ShareThis) 
and set these options:
	
✓	Enter the Widget Code: Obtain the code from the ShareThis website 
(you can access this on the ShareThis website within your account); 
then enter the code into this text box.
	
✓	Display the Link Only on Certain Pages of Your Site: By default, the 
ShareThis link is added at the very end of your blog post and page. 
You can turn off this default option. To do so, choose No from the 
Automatically Add ShareThis to Your Posts and the Automatically Add 
ShareThis to Your Pages drop-down lists that appear on the ShareThis 
Options page. Then add the following ShareThis template tag to your 
template wherever you want it to display on your site (you can add it to 
any template in your WordPress theme):
<?php if (function_exists(‘sharethis_button’)) { sharethis_button(); } ?>
This plugin requires the wp-footer() call in the footer (footer.php) of 
your template. If your theme doesn’t include a wp_footer() call, you can 
add it easily by opening the footer.php template (see Chapter 11) and 
adding this bit of code:
<?php wp_footer(); ?>
Subscribe to Comments
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/subscribe-to-comments
The Subscribe to Comments plugin lets your visitors subscribe to individual 
posts you’ve made to your blog. They receive a notification via e-mail when-
ever someone leaves a new comment on the post. This feature goes a long 
way toward keeping your readers informed and making the discussions lively 
and active.

 Chapter 17: Ten Powerful Plugins for WordPress
The plugin includes a full-featured Subscription Manager that your com-
menters can use to unsubscribe to certain posts, block all notifications, or 
even change their notification e-mail address.
WordPress.com Stats
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/stats
With the rise in popularity of the hosted WordPress.com service came a 
huge demand for the statistics that it provides in its Dashboard pages. Users 
of the self-hosted WordPress.org software drooled when they saw the stats 
available to WordPress.com users, and the cry for a similar stats plugin for 
WordPress.org went out across the blogosphere.
Andy Skelton answered that call with the release of the WordPress.com Stats 
plugin for WordPress.org users. This plugin collects all the important sta-
tistics, including the number of hits on the site per hour, day, or month; the 
most popular posts; the sources of the traffic on the site; and the links people 
click to leave the site.
	
You need a WordPress.com API key for this plugin to work. You can obtain 
an API key by creating an account on WordPress.com (http://wordpress.
com); you get an API key in your Personal Profile there. Simply copy it and 
paste it into the API field under Plugins➪WordPress.com after you activate the 
plugin. After you do that, a link called Blog Stats appears on the Dashboard 
menu, and you can click that link to view your site stats on your Dashboard.
WP Security Scan
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-security-scan
This plugin is relatively simple to use; it scans your entire WordPress instal-
lation and looks for any security vulnerabilities that may exist and then sug-
gests corrective actions that you can take to improve the overall security of 
your WordPress installation.
WP Super Cache
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-super-cache
WP Super Cache creates static HTML files from your dynamic WordPress 
content. Why is this useful? On a high-traffic site, having cached versions of 

350
Part V: The Part of Tens 
your posts and pages can speed up the load time of your website consider-
ably. A cached version simply means that the content is converted to static 
HTML pages (as opposed to dynamically created content pulled from your 
database through a series of PHP commands) that are then stored on the 
server. This process eases the efforts the web server must take to display the 
content in your visitors’ browsers.
WPMU Premium
http://premium.wpmudev.org
WPMU Premium isn’t just one plugin; it’s an entire collection of plugins that 
are geared toward and developed for users who take advantage of the multi-
site feature with WordPress, as well as the users who have developed a social 
community website by using the BuddyPress plugin for WordPress (covered 
in Chapter 16).
You can find all sorts of plugins to enhance your multisite and/or BuddyPress 
website. Here are just a few:
	
✓	Membership plugins that give you membership and affiliate capabilities 
on your network
	
✓	Classified ad plugins that allow you to grow a classified ads section
	
✓	Chat plugins that let you include interactive, real-time chat capabilities 
for your users to communicate with one another
	
✓	Domain mapping plugins that let you (and your community users) use 
your own domain on your network of sites
	
✓	Anti-spam plugins that prevent spam comments and spam sign-ups in 
your community
Access to the plugins at WPMU Premium isn’t free. There is a nominal fee to 
join, and you can choose among annual membership packages from $35 to 
$79 per month, which gives you access to more than 100 plugins (and more 
than 150 themes) along with some stellar, world-class support.

Ten Well-Designed Sites That  
Use WordPress as a CMS
In This Chapter
▶	Seeing examples of how WordPress powers websites
▶	Discovering sites that use WordPress for more than just blogging
A
 
 tremendous number of well-designed WordPress sites are on the 
web. Picking only ten to highlight here was a near-impossible task for 
me. Sometimes, you can look at a website and not even know whether it’s 
a blog or a site built with blogging software. Because users can extend the 
WordPress software to function as so much more than just a blog, people 
refer to WordPress as a content management system (CMS) rather than merely 
a blogging platform. (See Chapter 15 for more on WordPress as a CMS.)
In this chapter, I try to represent the types of websites built with the tools 
and techniques that I cover earlier in this book. So here you are: Ten sites 
that go beyond the blog.
IconDock
http://icondock.com
IconDock, created by the folks from N.Design Studio, is a perfect example of 
using WordPress as an online shop. IconDock has a fully functional and easy-
to-navigate e-commerce shop where visitors can purchase high-quality icons 
and graphics. IconDock uses the WP e-Commerce plugin and the DropShop 
commercial add-on plugin to create the drag-and-drop shop feature for its 
products.
If you can take away one good idea from IconDock, it’s the site’s smart use 
of the WP e-Commerce plugin to power its online shop. You can install this 
plugin (www.instinct.co.nz/e-commerce) on any WordPress-powered 

352
Part V: The Part of Tens 
website, and you immediately have a state-of-the-art e-commerce platform 
that allows you to host a full-featured shopping cart. Very professional! The 
possibilities of this plugin are endless. (See Chapter 16 for more on this plugin.)
Kate Rusby
www.katerusby.com
Kate Rusby (see Figure 18-1) is a folk musician whose website is powered 
by WordPress. The first thing that caught my eye is the pleasant, whimsical 
graphic design work that’s been applied to her WordPress theme. Through 
stunning graphic work, creative CSS styling, and HTML markup, her website 
design is clean, professional, and very eye pleasing.
Figure 18-1: The Kate Rusby site.
Kate’s website displays different types of content offerings on her website 
in a unique way that makes it easy for visitors to locate and consume. For 
examples, check out the following:

353
 Chapter 18: Ten Well-Designed Sites That Use WordPress as a CMS
	
✓	Audio recordings: www.katerusby.com/recordings
	
✓	Tour dates: www.katerusby.com/tour-dates
	
✓	Photo galleries: www.katerusby.com/gallery
Katy Perry
www.katyperry.com/home
The website for recording artist Katy Perry uses WordPress to showcase her 
message, music, and content offerings in a nicely designed package.
A lot is going on with Katy Perry’s website, but it’s a clean design that’s easy 
to navigate and includes some great features, such as
	
✓	The latest tweets from Katy’s Twitter account
	
✓	A Breaking News section on the front page that pulls content from her 
internal blog
	
✓	Blog posts that integrate social media sharing tools for Facebook, 
Twitter, and so on
	
✓	Feeds on her front page from her online merchandise store, ticket sales, 
and tour dates
	
✓	A music section that contains her entire discography, including album 
images, embedded audio files, and Buy Now buttons that allow you to 
purchase songs from iTunes
	
✓	A photo gallery that contains feeds from Katy’s Flickr account and inte-
grates social media sharing for each photo
LIVESTRONG
http://livestrongblog.org
The official blog of the LIVESTRONG Foundation is a well-designed WordPress 
theme that places the blog content on the front page but also uses some 
interesting tools to provide additional content from some of the foundation’s 
other websites. For example, in the right sidebar, you find great information 
and navigation links for its cancer support resource page on the web and 
its Team LIVESTRONG page about walks, runs, and triathlons to help raise 
awareness and money for cancer research.

354
Part V: The Part of Tens 
In addition to integrating content from its several sites, the LIVESTRONG blog 
also participates in a lot of social media and integrates it nicely on its website via
	
✓	YouTube video sharing
	
✓	Twitter feeds
	
✓	Flickr photo sharing
	
✓	Facebook Connect
	
✓	Social media sharing tools
Mozilla Labs
http://mozillalabs.com
Mozilla Labs is an online hub where developers can network, collaborate, 
develop, experiment, research, and learn about building web applications. 
Built on the WordPress platform, Mozilla Labs takes advantage of custom cat-
egory templates to create different types of content displays for each of the 
unique sections of its Projects page at http://mozillalabs.com/projects.
On the Projects page are more than 50 projects, both active and inactive, listed  
with well-designed icons and descriptions. Click a project, and you’re taken to 
that project’s page, which is either a static page or a category within WordPress. 
Each project page has a unique design that sets it apart from the rest of the 
pages within the site but is still branded with the Mozilla Labs look and feel.
In Chapters 12 and 15, I discuss content-specific templates that include static 
page and category templates. 
MSNBC
http://tv.msnbc.com
The MSNBC website (see Figure 18-2) runs on the WordPress platform to 
present content for this online news network. MSNBC makes heavy use of the 
custom post types feature in WordPress (see Chapter 14) to organize the dif-
ferent television news shows presented.
Aside from the content aspects on MSNBC, the site also takes full advantage 
of built-in WordPress features, such as featured images to display photos for 
each news story, embedded videos with a dedicated video gallery, customized 
use of the WordPress navigation menu navigation feature, widgets, and social 
media sharing and integration.

355
 Chapter 18: Ten Well-Designed Sites That Use WordPress as a CMS
Figure 18-2: The MSNBC website.
Time Healthland
http://healthland.time.com
The folks at Time must really, really like WordPress. Not only is the Healthland 
website fully powered by WordPress, but it’s also one of the VIP WordPress 
customers that takes advantage of the VIP offerings from Automattic (http://
vip.wordpress.com/hosting), the folks behind the WordPress.com service.
To go even further than that, the Time Healthland website is a child theme 
that uses the default Twenty Ten WordPress theme as the parent. (In 
Chapter 13, I show you how to create a child theme for the Twenty Thirteen 
theme.) The website was developed by the WordPress VIP consultants, 
WebDevStudios (see the section “WebDevStudios,” later in this chapter).
Time Healthland is a great example of a WordPress-powered website that 
goes beyond the typical blog type layout by getting creative with
	
✓	Post thumbnails: Post thumbnails add a nice visual component to blog 
posts. (See Chapter 12 for more on this feature.)

356
Part V: The Part of Tens 
	
✓	Popular posts: Listing the most popular blog posts (usually determined 
by the posts with the greatest number of views and/or comments) pro-
vides a nice navigation piece for new as well as returning visitors.
	
✓	Posts by category: Using the query_posts(); function (described in 
Chapter 12), this feature groups posts together nicely by topic.
	
✓	Social media integration: The site uses Twitter and Facebook integra-
tion through different tools and plugins, providing seamless sharing 
between website and social media.
WebDevStudios
http://webdevstudios.com
WebDevStudios is the website of the VIP WordPress consultants who 
designed and developed the Time Healthland and MSNBC sites (described 
earlier in this chapter), in addition to being the studio co-owned by yours 
truly. The WebDevStudios site is also a pretty stunning example (in my 
humble opinion) of what you can do with the Twenty Ten WordPress theme. 
(See Chapter 13 to find out how to create a child theme using Twenty 
Thirteen as the parent.)
Some of the features and design elements that really stick out as I browse 
through the website include
	
✓	The navigation menu: Just one look at its navigation menu isn’t enough. 
Hover your mouse over some of the links to see the hard work that went 
into building a rich navigation experience for visitors. The menu is enor-
mous, yet very clean, easy to read, and easy to navigate.
	
✓	A featured content slide show: At the top of the front page, underneath 
the logo and menu, WebDevStudios displays some of its more prominent 
content wrapped in a dynamic slide show via the WP Nivo Slider plugin, 
which you can find in the Plugin Directory at http://wordpress.org/
extend/plugins/wp-nivo-slider. This slide show brings your most 
treasured content front and center to share with your visitors.
	
✓	Social media integration: WebDevStudios integrates its Twitter account 
prominently by posting its most recent tweets from the WebDevStudios 
Twitter page. Additionally, you can easily find WebDevStudios on other 
social networks, such as Facebook and Flickr, through the use of social 
media icons found firmly planted at the top middle section of every page 
of the website.
	
✓	A static front page with internal blog: One of the techniques I discuss in 
this book is using a static page as the front page of your website and includ-
ing a blog as part of an internal section, rather than the main page. Check 
out WebDevStudios site for a solid example of this technique in practice.

 Chapter 18: Ten Well-Designed Sites That Use WordPress as a CMS
WeGraphics
http://wegraphics.net
WeGraphics (see Figure 18-3) is an e-commerce shop, powered by WordPress 
and the Cart66 shopping cart plugin (described in Chapter 16), that sells 
digital or downloadable products. One visit to this website shows how 
WordPress and an e-commerce plugin, combined with a beautiful design and 
layout, can provide you with a pretty fantastic storefront online.
Figure 18-3: The WeGraphics site.
The navigation is very user-friendly, starting with easy-to-read product cat-
egories, with coordinating and designated icons to set the product selections 
apart. At WeGraphics, you can purchase one product at a time or purchase 
a membership subscription that allows you to download several products 
during a given timeframe.

358
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Another reason why I include WeGraphics here is the high-quality graphic 
products it offers that benefit any budding web designer:
	
✓	Photoshop brushes
	
✓	Icon sets
	
✓	Texture files
	
✓	Vector graphics
	
✓	Theme designs
WordPress.org
http://wordpress.org
What else other than the official WordPress website? The site at http://
wordpress.org is home to the WordPress software, itself. The front page 
is a static page with a custom page template that serves as a portal into the 
offerings of the rest of the site.
At WordPress.org, you will find
	
✓	A gallery of websites in the Showcase: The showcase at http://
wordpress.org/showcase displays images of websites powered by 
WordPress.
	
✓	Themes and Plugin directories: You find a directory of all the themes and 
plugins available for the WordPress platform at http://wordpress.
org/extend/themes and http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins.
	
✓	Support forums: The WordPress forums at (http://wordpress.org/
support/) — powered by the bbPress plugin (http://wordpress.
org/extend/plugins/bbpress/) — enable users to create their own 
discussion forums on their WordPress website.
	
✓	Blog: The blog at http://wordpress.org/news gives the latest updates 
and blog entries about the WordPress project.
	
✓	WordPress software download: The WordPress.org website houses the 
official WordPress code base that you can download and use on your 
own site to run your own fantastic, WordPress-powered website!

About the Author
Lisa Sabin-Wilson has worked with the WordPress software since its incep-
tion in 2003 and has built her career around providing technical support, 
hosting, and design solutions for bloggers who use WordPress. She reaches 
thousands of people worldwide with her WordPress services, skills, and 
knowledge regarding the product. Lisa is also the author of the bestselling 
WordPress For Dummies, BuddyPress For Dummies, and WordPress All-in-One 
For Dummies.
Lisa operates a few blogs online, all of which are powered by WordPress. 
Her personal blog (http://lisasabin-wilson.com) has been online 
since February 2002; she and her partners, Brad Williams and Brian 
Messenlehner, at the custom WordPress design and development business at 
WebDevStudios (http://webdevstudios.com) provide custom develop-
ment and design services.
When she can be persuaded away from her computer, where she is usually 
hard at work providing design solutions for her WordPress clients, she some-
times emerges for public speaking appearances on the topics of design, blog-
ging, and WordPress. She has appeared at conferences such as the annual 
South By Southwest Interactive Conference, Blog World Expo, CMSExpo, and 
several WordCamp events across the country.
Lisa consults with bloggers both large and small. Bloggers come in many  
different flavors, from business to personal, from creative to technical, and 
all points in between. Lisa is connected to thousands of them worldwide and 
appreciates the opportunity to share her knowledge with WordPress Web 
Design For Dummies. She hopes you find great value in it, as well!
When not designing or consulting with her clients, you can usually find her at 
her favorite coffee shop sipping espresso, or on a mountaintop somewhere 
hitting the slopes with her family, or 100 feet beneath the ocean waters, 
scuba diving with her husband and swimming with the fishes.
You can find Lisa online at Twitter: @LisaSabinWilson.

Dedication
To the man who probably never thought he would ever have a tech book 
dedicated to him, my father, Donald Sabin. I have only ever wanted him to 
be proud of me, but so much more than that, I wanted him to be proud of 
himself for the man and father he was. By daily example, Dad taught me the 
lesson of unconditional love and the importance of family.
Author’s Acknowledgments
To WordPress . . . and all that entails from the developers, designers, forum 
helpers, bug testers, educators, consultants, plugin makers, and theme 
bakers. Every single person involved in the WordPress community plays a 
vital role in making this whole thing work, and work well. Kudos to all of you! 
Huge thanks to Amy Fandrei, Kim Darosett, and Amanda Graham from Wiley 
for their support, assistance, and guidance during the course of this project. 
Many thanks, as well, to my technical editor, Mitch Canter, and the other edi-
tors of the project who also worked hard to ensure its success.
To my family and close friends whom I may have neglected during the pro-
cess of writing this book, thank you for not abandoning me — your support 
sustains me!
Finally, tremendous thanks to my husband, Chris, for his unending support 
and love and for having the patience of a saint during the course of writing 
this book!
