Preface
In the age where telecommunication has become a standard, almost every portable
device has some kind of transmitter and receiver allowing it to connect to a cellular
network or available Wi-ﬁnetworks. We are also driving cars that are smarter,
equipped with new technologies, such as radars for collision detection. Other types
of radars are used in both civilian and military applications. Nowadays, we even
receive signals from satellites on our phones from global positioning systems. The
spectrum around us is full of transmitted signals waiting to be received. Current
trends toward increased wireless connectivity and the need to stay connected
everywhere and at all times call for extremely high data rates. In the world of today,
most wireless networks operate in frequency bands measured in low gigahertz
(GHz). Typically, this is done through channels with moderate bandwidth. To keep
up with the trends of increased data transmission rates, new and innovative ideas are
needed. Part of research efforts is directed at increasing the bandwidth of the
channels that are used for wireless communication. One of the areas of investigation
is transmission in the millimeter-wave regime, ranging from 30 to 300 GHz, where
there is an abundance of bandwidth.
Transmission in the millimeter-wave part of the spectrum comes with much
greater challenges than, for example, in the radio frequency (RF) or microwave part
of the spectrum. Receiving the transmitted signal poses a whole new set of chal-
lenges. The low-noise ampliﬁer (LNA) is the ﬁrst component that appears in the
front ends of most microwave and millimeter-wave receivers after an antenna
(except, perhaps, a low-loss bandpass ﬁlter for signal selection). The performance
of an RF and millimeter-wave receiver is therefore largely dependent on the per-
formance of the LNA that is used.
Primarily, the LNA is tasked with amplifying a signal while introducing as little
noise into the signal as possible. This is a necessity, because the signal received by
the antenna is already submerged in noise; thus before the signal can be processed,
it needs to be ampliﬁed with the smallest possible amount of additional noise
introduced in this process. As technologies such as silicon-germanium BiCMOS
and Silicon CMOS continue to evolve, so too does the number of low-cost,
high-performance transceiver systems that operate in the millimeter-wave region.
v

Most attempts to realize these transceiver systems are in integrated circuits (ICs),
which offer the beneﬁts of reduced size and lower cost.
The purpose of this book is twofold. The ﬁrst goal of the book is to bring
together the theory behind millimeter-wave circuit operation with the theory of
low-noise ampliﬁcation. Its second goal is to present new research in this multi-
disciplinary ﬁeld, by dissecting the common LNA conﬁgurations and typical
speciﬁcations into parts, which are then optimized separately over several chapters
to suggest improvements in the current state-of-the-art designs.
This, therefore, allows for the book to be divided into two parts, with Chap. 1
serving as the introduction to research. The ﬁrst part contextualizes LNA theory and
supporting multidisciplinary concepts, while the second part deals with the state
of the art in LNA research for the millimeter-wave regime and somewhat more
advanced topics associated with LNAs.
Chapter 1 gives the reader ample background on the importance of LNAs and
some of the challenges that are unique to millimeter-wave research, and serves to
formulate the research questions and establish this book as a comprehensive
research resource for LNAs that operate in the millimeter-wave regime.
Part I presents a detailed analysis of the current body of knowledge when it
comes to LNAs, speciﬁcally for millimeter applications. This includes detailed
analysis of two-port modeling, practical means of ampliﬁer analysis, gain equa-
tions, stability issues, various noise aspects, broadband techniques, and ampliﬁer
linearity. This is complemented by some telecommunication aspects associated
with LNAs, including placing the millimeter-wave range in the context of the other
transmission bands and a detailed review of millimeter-wave prospects, investiga-
tion into current antenna efforts and modulation schemes. Also in Part I, the
technologies for LNA implementations are discussed. The latest developments in
various high-fT and fMAX transistors are investigated in an attempt to evaluate
suitable semiconductor devices for LNA implementation at millimeter-wave fre-
quencies. This is followed by the complete small-signal model analysis of both
MOSFETs (and variations thereof) and HBTs. Transistor noise modeling, para-
mount for LNAs, is also discussed together with substrates for discrete LNA
implementations. Furthermore, the feasibility of passives at frequencies up to
millimeter-wave bands is presented. This refers to both lumped passives (resistors,
capacitors, inductors) and transmission line passives, with some innovative ideas.
Traditionally, lumped passives have been unsuitable for millimeter-wave because
of their high parasitics, but with recent technology improvements, the use of
lumped passives is also possible and is discussed at some length. Finally, various
LNA conﬁgurations and the design theory of these, devised from ﬁrst principles of
ampliﬁer operation, are discussed. Techniques such as simultaneous matching for
power and noise, as well as bandwidth enhancement, are discussed for both nar-
rowband and wideband applications.
In Part II, state-of-the-art LNA conﬁgurations and means for their deployment
are discussed. Some complex practical LNA conﬁgurations are looked at, and the
latest research efforts, with the focus on linearization and optimization, exclusively
in the millimeter-wave regime, are presented. Weaknesses of state-of-the-art
vi
Preface

conﬁgurations are considered, thereby opening up opportunities for looking at ways
of optimizing these state-of-the-art conﬁgurations. The focus then shifts toward
research areas that are still under development. The topics include the inﬂuence of
wavelength, layout, cross-talk, bonding, and packaging onto LNA performance,
among others. Advanced fabrication technologies used to decrease the parasitics of
passive and active devices and therefore optimize circuits such as LNAs are also
explored.

implementation.
Minimization of the parasitic effects of passives by introducing innovative ideas for
their construction is another of the topics explored here. Alternative design
methodologies, such as LNA/antenna co-design, are considered. Part II also looks
at the current extent and availability of electronic design automation (EDA) for use
when designing LNAs. Ongoing research efforts into automated LNA design and
optimization are furthermore investigated. A number of EDA options for
high-quality passive components (inductors), matching, LNAs, and even complete
receivers are proposed. Finally, remaining research gaps in LNA research for the
millimeter-wave regime and future directions are explored. The book concludes
with the authors’ proposal for streamlined automated LNA design ﬂow, which
focuses on the design of the LNA as a collection of highly optimized subsystems
(parts).
The authors would like to recognize Dr. Riëtte de Lange, Director of Research
Productivity & Improvement of Staff Qualiﬁcations, Strategic Initiatives and
Administration, University of Johannesburg, South Africa, for her coordination.
Furthermore, the authors would like to recognize the support of technical
reviewers, as well as language and graphic editors, who’ve all contributed to this
process. We value the system of scholarly peer review and the approach that this
adds to the production of research text that adds to the body of scientiﬁc
knowledge.

Chapter 1
Introduction and Research Impact
Abstract The opening chapter of this book seeks a research gap in the context of
LNAs for millimeter-wave applications. It is organized as follows: LNA as a part of
the millimeter-wave transceiver system are introduced. Following this introduction,
some fundamental LNA concepts are presented, which aim to assist in deﬁning a
research gap relating to this topic. This serves as an aid in formulating research
questions that are to be answered throughout the book. The chapter is concluded
with the section on the organization of the book. As this chapter is merely an
introduction, many concepts mentioned here will become more clear only later in
the book.
Current trends towards increased wireless connectivity and the need to stay con-
nected everywhere and at all times call for extremely high data rates. In the world of
today, most wireless networks operate in frequency bands measured in low giga-
hertz (GHz). Typically, this is done through channels with moderate bandwidth. To
keep up with the trends of increased data transmission rates, new and innovative
ideas are needed. Part of research efforts is directed at increasing the bandwidth of
the channels that are used for wireless communication. One of the areas of
investigation is transmission in the millimeter-wave regime, ranging from 30 to
300 GHz, where there is an abundance of bandwidth [1]. Sub-terahertz frequencies
have also recently been explored for signal emission [2].
Transmission in the millimeter-wave part of the spectrum comes with much
greater challenges than for example in the radio-frequency (RF) or microwave part
of the spectrum. This is a topic that could be explored in a series of books, but
receiving the transmitted signal poses a whole other set of challenges. Furthermore,
the low-noise ampliﬁer (LNA) is the ﬁrst component that appears in the front ends
of most microwave and millimeter-wave receivers [3] after an antenna (except,
perhaps, a low-loss bandpass ﬁlter for signal selection). The performance of an RF
and millimeter-wave receiver is therefore largely dependent on the performance of
the LNA that is used. Primarily, the LNA is tasked with amplifying a signal while
introducing as little noise into the signal as possible, a concept that can be illus-
trated graphically in the time and frequency domain, as shown in Fig. 1.1 [4]. This

is a necessity, because the signal received by the antenna is already submerged in
noise, thus before the signal can be processed, it needs to be ampliﬁed with the
smallest possible amount of additional noise introduced in this process. This is even
more true because of the limitation of wave propagation in the millimeter-wave
regime, where there is a trade-off between data-rate, range and power, as depicted in
Fig. 1.2 [5], and the signal reaching the receiver is often very weak.
Drastic improvements in transistor technology in the last few decades have
shifted the focus away from traveling wave tubes and klystron ampliﬁers, and the
vast majority of high-frequency ampliﬁers rely on solid-state devices to provide
ampliﬁcation [6–8]. As technologies, such as silicon-germanium (SiGe) bipolar
complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (BiCMOS) and Silicon CMOS continue
to evolve, so too does the number of low-cost, high-performance transceiver

systems that operate in the millimeter-wave region [9]. Most attempts to realize
these transceiver systems are in integrated circuits (ICs), which offer the beneﬁts of
reduced size and lower cost.
The opening chapter of this book seeks a research gap in the context of LNAs for
millimeter-wave applications. The chapter is organized as follows: First, the LNA
as a part of the millimeter-wave transceiver system is introduced. Following this
introduction, some fundamental LNA concepts are presented, which aim to assist in
deﬁning a research gap relating to this topic. This serves as an aid in formulating
research questions that are to be answered throughout the book. This chapter is
concluded with the section on the organization of the book.
As this chapter is merely an introduction, many concepts mentioned here will
only become more clear in Part I of this book, with Part II focusing on the research
outputs.

Low-Noise Ampliﬁer Research Contextualization:
A Transmitter and Receiver System
A typical communication system consists of at least one transmitter and one
receiver [3], as shown in Fig. 1.3. The transceiver architecture for millimeter-wave
applications does not differ greatly from typical RF and microwave transceivers.

1.1.1
Transmitter
A typical transmitter consists of circuitry for baseband processing, digital-to-analog
conversion, ﬁleting, ampliﬁcation, carrier generation, modulation and power
ampliﬁcation, as shown in the top part of Fig. 1.3. It is designed to operate
according to one of the modulation schemes that will be discussed in Chap. 2. For
millimeter-wave ampliﬁcation, either sliding-IF superheterodyne transmitter (where
IF stands for intermediate frequency) or direct-conversion transmitter architectures
can be used (with the latter depicted in Fig. 1.4).
In a zero-IF direct conversion transmitter, suitable for binary phase shift keying
(BPSK) or quadrature-phase shift keying (QPSK), a baseband processor creates the
in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) parts of the signal that are separately converted into
analog signals, that are further ﬁltered and ampliﬁed, before being modulated onto
carriers. Two carriers, 90° out of phase, are needed. The signals are then combined
and ampliﬁed, through a block referred to as the power ampliﬁer. The last part of
any transmitter is the transmitting antenna, the physical device designed to transfer
the electrical signals into the air.
The power ampliﬁer, a narrowband component with the aim to deliver the
maximum amount of power to the antenna, is possibly the most challenging block
to design in any transmitter, even for the frequencies below millimeter-wave. This
is because of the need for simultaneous delivery of high power, high efﬁciency and
factors such as high gain and linearity. To address these issues, many power
ampliﬁer conﬁgurations have been proposed, with a considerable amount of

research efforts still continuing. Conﬁgurations include continuous mode ampliﬁers
(Classes A, B, AB, C and J) to switch-mode conﬁgurations (Classes E, F, EF, E−1,
F−1). The authors have already discussed power ampliﬁers on several occasions,
most recently in [10], albeit for frequencies up to Ku-band. For challenges asso-
ciated with millimeter-wave power ampliﬁer research, readers are referred to [11].

in
the
millimeter-wave range owing to the increased frequency of operation [1]. The
design of the LO is problematic because the frequency of oscillation often tends to
get close to the transistor’s transitional frequency, a phenomenon that will be
discussed in Chap. 3. Similar issues are associated with active mixers, where the
active devices used for mixing are also conﬁgured for gain, but are less prominent
in passive mixers, which involve devices conﬁgured as simple switches. For
millimeter-wave, the effort in designing high-gain efﬁcient antennas is also
increased [12], and research into this will be discussed in some detail in Chap. 2.
1.1.2
The Receiver and the Role of a Low-Noise Ampliﬁer
In the receiver, the signal is processed in the reverse order to that of the transmitter,
that is, the signal received from the antenna is ﬁrst ampliﬁed (using an LNA), then
demodulated before baseband processing is applied. Figure 1.5 shows a quadrature
receiver architecture. A voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO), part of the carrier
recovery circuit, typically replaces a pure oscillator circuit, and is required to have a
wide tuning range [1].
Two architectures that are encountered most often in millimeter-wave receivers

Direct-conversion receivers use a mixer and an LO tuned to the same frequency as
the received signal. This means that the signal is converted directly to baseband
(instead of an IF), and such an architecture is sometimes referred to as a zero-IF
receiver. Direct-conversion receivers thus do not require IF ﬁlters, ampliﬁers and
secondary mixers, which saves a reasonable amount of circuit real estate and also
reduces power consumption. However, achieving acceptable phase noise perfor-
mance in quadrature oscillators that operate in millimeter-wave bands has proven to
be quite challenging, which can be considered as the main drawback of this
architecture [14].
On the other hand, superheterodyne receivers have been highly popular at
microwave
frequencies,
and
have
also
been
extensively
employed
in
millimeter-wave receivers. A modiﬁcation of this architecture that is often found in
millimeter-wave systems is the so-called sliding-IF receiver [17], shown in Fig. 1.6.
The receiver can often be conﬁgured as a transmitter as well, thus the transmit path
is also shown.
The performance of millimeter-wave and sub-terahertz communication networks
is heavily reliant on a low noise ﬁgure as well as high gain and linearity of the LNA
implemented at the receiver [1]. A properly designed LNA will meet these
requirements despite temperature ﬂuctuations, process inconsistencies and signal
levels. Achieving this in the millimeter-wave bands can be a daunting task, since
multiple stages are often required to achieve high gains and manufacturing varia-
tions play a large role in device parameters [18].

Introduction and Research Impact

An LNA, like the power ampliﬁer, is fundamentally a narrowband device, but as
the frequencies increase, having wide bandwidth allows for greater reusability, thus
the design process of wideband LNAs requires an additional amount of effort,
leading to the fact that some of the latest LNA research efforts are reported in
wideband LNAs.
As this chapter progresses, it will become abundantly clear that the performance
of the LNA has a detrimental effect on the remainder of the receiver circuit,
especially in terms of noise ﬁgure.
1.2
Signiﬁcance of Active and Passive Devices
for Low-Noise Ampliﬁer Research
A basic LNA incorporates a minimum of one active device. The active device is
responsible for the gain of an ampliﬁer, but it is also known to introduce noise,
parasitics and nonlinearities. Active devices, or in other words, transistors, will form
the topic of Chap. 3. As will be discussed later, transistors can be divided into two
large groups: ﬁeld-effect transistors (FETs) and bipolar junction transistors (BJTs).
Homojunction BJTs are fundamentally incapable of reaching high frequencies;
instead, heterojunction bipolar transistors or HBTs, are used more regularly.
High-electron-mobility transistors (HEMTs), a variation of FETs, are also used.
Because of their lower transitional frequencies (frequency at which transistor
gain-bandwidth product becomes zero), metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) FET
(MOSFET) devices have generally been considered less suitable for high-frequency
ampliﬁcation tasks than their HBT counterparts, but this difference is becoming
smaller as superior MOSFET technologies emerge. Apart from differences based on
fundamental device properties, transistors, whether FETs or HBTs and whether
aimed at integrated or discrete applications, yield different performance when
fabricated in different technologies. Several factors, including the transistor tran-
sition frequency, the breakdown voltage of the transistor and the driving capability
of the transistor, are typically taken into consideration when choosing the suitable
transistor for a particular implementation [19]. Technologies capable of reaching
even sub-terahertz frequencies have been reported [2]. As technologies are
improving their reach towards higher frequencies, there is also a constant need for
improved modeling means, which presents a separate area of research.
The suitability of a semiconductor material for high-frequency transistor fabri-
cation is typically qualiﬁed by a number of ﬁgures of merit: Johnson’s ﬁgure of
merit (JFOM) and Baliga’s ﬁgure of merit (BFOM) are commonly used [20, 21].
LNAs also require a number of passive components, such as inductors, resistors,
capacitors and transmission lines. Inductors and capacitors have traditionally been
implemented using lumped components even in integrated RF circuits, because of
the impractical sizes of transmission line elements. At millimeter-wave, the length
of transmission lines allows for their integration, but integrated lumped components

are still considered, provided they can provide adequate quality factors (Q-factors)
and can be designed so that the frequency of interest is below their resonant
frequency. For example, an inductor used at 60 GHz must have a resonant fre-
quency roughly exceeding 100 GHz [22]. The resonant frequency of each passive,
inductor or capacitor can loosely be described as the frequency at which an inductor
turns into a capacitor or a capacitor turns into an inductor. This is best understood in
terms of the impedance of the inductor or capacitor: if the impedance of an inductor
is plotted vs. frequency, it has a positive slope and at the point of resonance, the
slope of the curve suddenly turns negative. This is illustrated in Fig. 1.7 [7].
The important fact to consider when designing ampliﬁers for RF, microwave and
millimeter-wave applications, is to be careful when designing with ideal devices, as
their models ignore the parasitic effects, an approach that seldom generates good
results even on the ﬁrst design iteration. Real devices and their parasitic effects need
to be considered. As the frequency increases, it becomes progressively more dif-
ﬁcult to ﬁnd a device with the expected performance. Recently, a considerable
amount of research has been invested in the concept of system-on-package
(SoP) [23], which allows for passives to be fabricated on different, more suitable
substrates, but still packaged together with active devices, built on silicon, and
many other components. The idea behind SoP is thus that even with many system
components designed in different technologies or on different substrates but in the
same packaging, the components are placed closer together, allowing for shorter
interconnects, which in turn can decrease parasitic effects and result in an overall
improvement of system performance [23, 24]. Components such as antennas can
also be placed on these packages with ease.
Thus the feasibility of passives will be the leitmotif in this book, most promi-
nently in Chap. 2, when the feasibility of passives is discussed for different fre-
quencies, in Chap. 4, when different options for passives are discussed, and ﬁnally,
in Chap. 9, when the electronic design automation (EDA) perspective on passives is
considered.
In Fig. 1.8, for illustrative purposes, one active and one passive device are
shown. In Fig. 1.8a, a layout of a power transistor in the 180-nm GlobalFoundries
(previously IBM) 7WL technology [25] is captured, and Fig. 1.8b shows a pho-
tograph of an integrated inductor in the same technology.

Signiﬁcance of Device Packaging at Millimeter-Wave
Range
Packaging of ICs is needed to protect the die from external inﬂuences. However, the
connection of the packed system still needs to be made with the external circuitry
such as the printed circuit board (PCB). This is established by three components
connected in series: bond pads, bond wires, and ﬁnally, package leads. These are
typically made of copper, aluminum or various alloys, all having high conductivity.
Bond pads, however, exhibit capacitive behavior, and bond wires and package
leads exhibit inductive behavior (the extent depends on the package used); all
typically cause mismatch and distortion. The package models are now becoming
commonly available to designers because of the ever-increasing need for accurate
simulation and modeling [26]. Thus packaging considerations are an important step
in LNA optimization and packaging will be considered when discussing the
advanced LNA optimization techniques in Chap. 8.

Practical Research Focus: Applications
of Millimeter-Wave Low-Noise Ampliﬁers
In the introductory section of this book, millimeter-wave LNAs have been announced
from the perspective of application in modern communication and broadcast systems,
where there is a need for higher transmission rates and bandwidth. This includes,
among others, home and ofﬁce network solutions, millimeter-wave cellular com-
munication networks, high-deﬁnition digital television (HDTV) and ultra-HDTV
(UHD TV [27]) broadcasting. This set of commercial applications represents by far
the applications with the largest potential for millimeter-waves.

The beneﬁts of millimeter-wave utilization are numerous [28]. Besides unmat-
ched bandwidth and scalable capacity, one of the main beneﬁts is the fact that
millimeter-wave links can be achieved with narrow beams, the concept that will be
illustrated in Chap. 2. This means that multiple millimeter-wave links can be
deployed in close proximity. Another beneﬁt comes from the licensing that is
cheaper in millimeter-wave (with unlicensed bands also available in many coun-
tries). This, among other factors, has resulted in several other broad groups of
applications of millimeter-wave circuits, and inherently LNAs. The following
applications can therefore be identiﬁed in addition to various types of wireless
communications:
• Millimeter-wave automotive receivers [29];
• Millimeter-wave military radar receivers [30];
• Receivers for radio astronomy [31];
• Active and passive high-resolution imaging receivers [32]; and
• Space-borne atmospheric sensing [33].
Millimeter-wave radars are extensively employed in automotive systems.
Examples include vehicular collision detection, intelligent cruise control, lane and
blind spot assistance systems, parking assistance and brake assistance. This requires
at least three types of radar: short, medium and long range radars. With the
advanced technologies becoming more readily available, the cost of producing
these automotive systems has led to a change in focus towards automotive research.
A second set of radar applications is in integrated defense platforms, both on
land and in the air. Examples include systems for modern combat aircraft, where
millimeter-wave radars provide high resolution tracking capabilities and missile
defense systems, then active protection radars to protect land vehicles from
anti-tank threats and ﬁnally, high-resolution surveillance radar and ad hoc com-
munication networks [34].
Similarly, high-resolution imaging technology is used in landing assistance
systems for airplanes and helicopters in low visibility conditions [35]. Another
imaging application lies in airport security, where millimeter-wave cameras can
provide a means of detecting concealed weapons, explosives and contraband hidden
beneath cloth surfaces. Given the latest security issues around the world, great
investments are put into this kind of research.
With the square kilometer array radio telescope being developed, new and
innovative research is attempting to address the speciﬁc needs of radio astronomy.
Radio astronomy applications require extreme sensitivity in order to capture signals
that have traveled light-years to reach our planet. The positioning of the LNA in a
wireless receiver makes it a key component in radio astronomy applications for all
frequencies.
Atmospheric remote sensing is another application where LNAs are used in
scientiﬁc research. Observing water vapor molecular properties is an important
activity in climate research. Water vapor has a rotational molecular response at

Introduction and Research Impact

183 GHz, which can be directly monitored by a radiometer to obtain information
about weather factors such as pressure, humidity and moisture.
Different applications require different center frequencies. For example, most
research in millimeter-wave communication networks focuses on the 60 GHz fre-
quency band; automotive radars, on the other hand, typically operate around
77 GHz and many other applications require frequencies that are even higher.
Among the abovementioned three frequency ranges, a particularly attractive
application of millimeter-wave LNAs is their use in 60 GHz communication sys-
tems. With 7 GHz of unlicensed bandwidth around 60 GHz and the heightened
interest in consumer applications in this band, systems that operate in this band
have been extensively investigated over the last decade.
The typical frequency distribution within the millimeter-wave range will also be
discussed in more detail in Chap. 2.
1.5
Identifying Research Gaps: Fundamental Principles
of Operation of Low-Noise Ampliﬁers
Fundamental principles of operation of LNAs will be explored in this section
through a few circuit diagrams of typical LNAs, followed by several deﬁning
equations, important for the contextualization of ongoing research efforts.
Throughout this chapter, at least, circuit diagrams will favor MOS notation, and the
device terminals will be referred to as gate, source and drain. Typically, MOS
notation can be replaced with BJT (HBT) notation, and therefore, one can refer to
base, emitter and collector.
1.5.1
Low-Noise Ampliﬁer Topologies
Figure 1.9 shows a generic circuit diagram of a typical LNA built around a tran-
sistor, T1 [36]. The transistor, T1, is shown as an n-channel MOS (nMOS) transistor,
but it can be any high-frequency transistor (MOS, HBT, BJT, HEMT or other) used
in a particular LNA application. Furthermore, the active device is shown conﬁgured
as a common-source ampliﬁer, while in practice other conﬁgurations or combina-
tions of active devices are possible. The simplest conﬁguration that deploys a
transistor conﬁgured in common-source (MOS transistors) conﬁguration (or
common-emitter conﬁguration, if an HBT is used), is sufﬁcient to describe the
LNA. The transistor is typically biased with the conduction angle 2h of 360°. If
periodic sinusoidal waveforms are assumed, then the conduction angle refers to the
portion of the waveform period cycle during which the transistor conducts, and is
more applicable to large-signal ampliﬁer operation (e.g. power ampliﬁers). A ﬁgure
of 2h = 360° simply means that the transistor conducts all the time.

Voltage, VDD, is the voltage supply and RFC is the RF choke—ideally an
inductor with inﬁnite reactance and zero series resistance. The RFC is large enough
to ensure substantially constant current through the drain (or collector) of the
transistor. The input RF signal is applied through the input matching network.
Sometimes the source (or emitter) is degenerated, which is also shown in the ﬁgure.
The output is fed through an output network to the load. Feedback, commonly
deployed in LNAs, is also shown in this ﬁgure, but it could be omitted. A different
combination of circuit elements results in either narrowband or wideband ampli-
ﬁers, with a lot of research effort devoted to wideband designs, because of their
greater number of applications.
The detailed analysis of several LNA conﬁgurations will be performed
throughout Chaps. 4 and 5. Only two practical LNA conﬁgurations, one based on
the single-transistor common-source ampliﬁer and the other based on the cascode
common-source ampliﬁer, will be shown here. The third commonly used practical
conﬁguration, built around a common-gate ampliﬁer [37], will be omitted for now.
In Fig. 1.10, a cascode conﬁguration is shown [1]. The cascode facilitates the
independent matching at the input and output, and also facilitates the overall system
gain by increasing the output impedance [38]. One of the main drawbacks of using
the cascode conﬁguration is that it reduces ampliﬁer linearity due to the reduced
output swing. Figure 1.10 also illustrates the importance of using inductors in an
LNA design. Input matching is performed via inductor Lg. The source degenerating
inductor Ls serves to allow for simultaneous noise and power matching
optimization.
The second practical conﬁguration is the shunt-series feedback ultra-wideband
(UWB) LNA, as shown in Fig. 1.11 [36], built around a single transistor.
Single-transistor topologies are preferred for low-voltage operation [38]. In this

ﬁgure, there is a feedback path through components Lf, Rf and Cf, CC is a blocking
capacitor and CB is used to stabilize the DC supply. In addition to wide bandwidth,
feedback ampliﬁers, such as the one depicted, offer features such as constant
gain-bandwidth product (GBP), the ability to modify the input and output impe-
dance, which in turn facilitates wideband power matching and allows for simul-
taneous noise and power matching. Thus, this conﬁguration accomplishes similar
performance as the cascode LNA conﬁguration.

1.5.2
Gain of the Low-Noise Ampliﬁer
Since the main purpose of an LNA is to amplify the received signal while main-
taining a low noise ﬁgure and low power consumption, naturally the ampliﬁcation
gain of the ampliﬁer, its power consumption and the noise would be the parameters
that should be discussed early in this book.
The power gain of any ampliﬁer, including the LNA, is deﬁned as a ratio of
output power (power delivered to the load) to input power (both in watt), and is
typically denoted by G:
G ¼ PL
Pin
:
ð1:1Þ
Detailed ampliﬁer gain theory will be presented as part of research contextual-
ization in Chap. 2.
1.5.3
Noise in Low-Noise Ampliﬁers
Noise in electronic circuits refers to small current and voltage ﬂuctuations generated
in electronic devices, owing to the fact that the electrical charge is not continuous
but is rather carried in discrete amounts [39]. Shot noise, thermal noise, ﬂicker
noise, burst noise and avalanche noise are types of noise that are associated with
electronic circuits. As noise considerations are the most important consideration
after gain in LNAs, an extensive study of noise phenomena will be performed
alongside the discussion of active devices in a separate chapter, Chap. 3.
The noise ﬁgure and noise factor are the most common noise metrics. The noise
factor is the ratio of the input signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to the output SNR, or
more formally,
F ¼ SNRi
SNRo
:
ð1:2Þ
This ratio is always greater than or equal to 1. F is equal to 1 only in ideal,
noiseless circuits. The noise factor is often expressed in decibel (dB), and is in those
cases termed the noise ﬁgure (and denoted by NF); however, the two terms are
often used interchangeably.
1.5.4
Power Consumption and Efﬁciency
Total DC power consumption is an important quantity in an LNA design, especially
for
battery-powered
portable
devices.
Furthermore,
in
millimeter-wave
14

Introduction and Research Impact

communication systems, power consumption needs to be balanced with data rate,
since a higher data rate will require greater power levels. LNA designs achieving
power consumption levels in the range of 1–2 mW have been reported on several
occasions [40, 41].
The DC input power of a one-transistor MOS-based LNA is the current drawn
from the voltage supply over a period of time T, or
Pdc ¼ 1
T
ZT
0
VDDiDdt ¼ VDD
T
ZT
0
iDdt ¼ VDDIDC;
ð1:3Þ
where IDC is the DC component of the current waveform and iD is the current
through the drain of the transistor. In multi-transistor LNAs, the total current
consumption will include the power consumed by all active devices in the circuit
(including biasing, discussed later).
The power dissipated in a bipolar transistor is determined by the collector and
base currents and voltages. Since the base current IB is generally much smaller than
the collector current IC, the power consumed in the circuit can be approximated
with Eq. (1.3) above, with VDD replaced by VCC.
Efﬁciency is a measure of performance of an ampliﬁer, and it is especially
associated with power ampliﬁers. However, it is often considered in LNAs, as it has
been shown that the linearity metrics of an LNA are indirectly dependent on the
power consumption [42]. A given level of IIP3 (discussed later in this chapter) can
be achieved without increasing the power supplied to the LNA, but when more
parameters such as gain, noise ﬁgure and bandwidth are taken into account,
improving linearity roughly translates to an increase in power consumed.
If the output power of the LNA can be expressed as Pout = veff ieff, where ieff and
veff are effective and i1 and v1 are the peak fundamental components of current and
voltage respectively, the drain efﬁciency η is deﬁned as the ratio of RF output
power (Pout) to DC input power (Pdc) deﬁned in Eq. (1.3):
g ¼ Pout
Pdc
:
ð1:4Þ
The antenna connected to the receiver has its own efﬁciency, and together with
the efﬁciency of the ampliﬁer, inﬂuences the efﬁciency of the complete system.
1.5.5
Reverse Isolation
With the gain deﬁned as the ratio of the amount of power at the output port of an
ampliﬁer to the amount of power applied at the input port, a similar concept can be
deﬁned if the power is applied at the output port. This is called reverse isolation.
1.5
Identifying Research Gaps: Fundamental Principles …
15

Reverse isolation is measured in the same way as the gain, but in this case the
ampliﬁer is connected back-to-front [43]. While it is desirable to achieve large
values of forward gain, low values of reverse isolation are required. If both gain and
reverse isolation are expressed in dB, then a related concept called active directivity
can be deﬁned. This refers to the difference between isolation and forward gain and
can be considered a more informative measurement of the reverse isolation between
input and output ports of the ampliﬁer.
1.5.6
Impedance Matching
An LNA needs to be inserted between the antenna and, typically, between the
demodulation circuit with minimum possible insertion loss. The only way this can
be accomplished is with calls for careful impedance matching, that is, controlling
the input and output impedances of the ampliﬁer as seen by the source and the load.
Typically, matching of a general ampliﬁer is performed to ensure that maximum
power transfer occurs between the ampliﬁer and the load. In LNAs, matching also
serves to reduce power loss and degradation in SNR (or the noise ﬁgure). In LNA
design, because of the requirement to reduce the minimum detectable signal level, as
seen before, this is referred to as simultaneous power and noise matching. This is
typically application-speciﬁc and the efforts of achieving simultaneous power and
noise matching will be explored in later chapters of this book. However, some typical
matching networks for maximum power transfer will be explored already in Chap. 2.
1.5.7
Bandwidth and Gain Flatness
Many LNAs are speciﬁed to operate over wide frequency ranges. The bandwidth of
an LNA or another ampliﬁer is deﬁned as the difference between the upper fre-
quency f2 and lower frequency f1, both frequencies marking the points where the
magnitude of signal passing through the ampliﬁer is typically 3 dB below (half of)
the maximum gain magnitude, as illustrated in Fig. 1.12, thus
BW ¼ f2  f1:
ð1:5Þ
In millimeter-wave systems, bandwidth is sometimes speciﬁed in terms of per-
centage bandwidth, which is the ratio (in percentage) of the absolute bandwidth to
the highest frequency at which the system operates. At 60 GHz, 1% corresponds to
600 MHz bandwidth.
An important aspect of the ampliﬁer, closely associated with bandwidth, is gain
ﬂatness over the speciﬁed bandwidth. It is typically speciﬁed in dB, is simply the
variation in gain over the desired operation range, and is commonly known as
ripple. This concept is also illustrated in Fig. 1.12.
16
1
Introduction and Research Impact

Lastly, noise bandwidth is a concept that was introduced to simplify the noise
calculations. It refers to an equivalent pass band that passes the same amount of
noise power as the actual system considered. The noise bandwidth is nearly equal to
the 3 dB bandwidth of the system.
As discussed before, increasing the bandwidth of an LNA increases its
reusability in numerous applications. As will be seen in later chapters of this book,
LNAs for millimeter-wave applications with bandwidths greater than 20 GHz have
been reported [44]. In order for the ampliﬁer to be a truly wideband ampliﬁer, gain
needs to remain ﬂat and matching needs to be constant over the whole band of
interest. As the required bandwidth increases, this becomes increasingly difﬁcult.
Some general bandwidth enhancement techniques will be presented in Chap. 2, and
this topic will be explored in more detail when speciﬁc LNA conﬁgurations are
investigated in Chaps. 5 and 6 and later when the state of the art is presented in
Chap. 7.
1.5.8
LNA Sensitivity
Sensitivity is deﬁned as the smallest signal that the ampliﬁer can reliably detect.
Typically, sensitivity is deﬁned as the strength of the smallest signal at the input of
a network that causes the output signal power to be M times the output noise power.
M is commonly speciﬁed as M = 1.
1.5.9
LNA Selectivity
Selectivity is the ability of a circuit to select the desired signal at a given frequency
and reject interference signals [4]. Typically, the selection of a correct signal is
achieved by the bandpass ﬁlter placed between the antenna and an LNA, but in

certain cases, the selection can be achieved by the narrowband LNA, in which case
selectivity of the LNA becomes important.
1.5.10
Low-Noise Ampliﬁer Linearity
High linearity is one of the main requirements of each ampliﬁer and more specif-
ically, each LNA. Nonlinear behavior often degrades system performance and
results in a phenomenon called distortion. Distortion is typically manifested by the
harmonics of the carrier frequency, intermodulation distortion (IMD) or gain
compression [7]. Some of the ongoing LNA research struggles are related to lin-
earity and distortion. Ampliﬁer linearization techniques include feedback tech-
niques, feedforward techniques, harmonic termination, optimal biasing, distortion
cancellation and post-distortion linearization [45].
The concepts that are often studied with distortion are its measures: the third
order intercept point (IP3) and the ampliﬁer dynamic range. These concepts will be
studied in detail in Chap. 2.
1.5.11
The Role of Electronic Design Automation
Computer-aided design is not uncommon in circuit design, and as a matter of fact, is
used in many stages of circuit design. A typical design ﬂow for an electronic circuit
incorporates many steps, some automated, and some performed by hand.
A conceptual analog design is typically done by hand, perhaps with the aid of a
mathematic package. Design options are drawn in a schematic editor. The perfor-
mance of the circuit is then normally simulated in SPICE1 or RF SPICE [46] based
simulators, to investigate either the DC or AC operation of circuits or, for example,
the frequency response of circuits. Furthermore, automatic place-and-route tools
can be used to connect circuitry on the layout level, but typically, in analog or RF
design, this is still done by hand. Different place-and-route tools can sometimes be
used for route tracks on PCBs for discrete implementations. Automated tools can
also be used for parasitic extraction, and electromagnetic (EM) simulators or other
specialist software can be used to cater for transmission lines or other passive
devices. In millimeter wave design, EM simulations become paramount because
such simulations are able to extract parameters like losses or parasitics.
It is evident, however, that even with the increased computing power
ever-present in the EDA solution, an amount of hand design still needs to be
performed in the typical design ﬂow [47]. This identiﬁes a clear research gap in the
efforts in developing custom EDA. Custom EDA can help streamline the design of

any circuit or system, including LNAs or passive components. Recently, some
efforts have been made to explore custom EDA ideas. These efforts are typically
tied with modeling efforts, whether device modeling or system modeling.
An entire chapter of this book (Chap. 9) will be dedicated to EDA efforts,
starting with the review of the commercial EDA software and the typical RF design
ﬂow, followed by suggestions for custom EDA development.
1.6
Research Questions: Low-Noise Ampliﬁer
for Millimeter-Wave Applications
From the discussion in the opening sections of this chapter, the following can be
concluded:
• The LNA is the fundamental building block of each receiver, the main function
of which is to amplify the incoming weak signals from the noisy channel
without adding extra noise.
• The design of LNAs is challenging even at well-researched frequency bands
where most commercial communication systems of today operate, because of
the fundamental operation of LNAs that requires simultaneous power and noise
match, which requires that the design deviates from the standard ampliﬁer
design equations.
• As frequencies increase towards the millimeter wave range, the design con-
straints become even more limiting:
– The frequency response of active devices (transistors) heavily inﬂuences the
performance of an LNA;
– Passive devices stop performing predictively, which requires improved
designs of passives such as capacitors and inductors either by improving
current designs or topologies or by searching for new ones;
– The effects of layout and packaging that are normally disregarded at lower
frequencies need to be included in the design;
– Performance parameters, for example noise ﬁgure, gain and linearity need to
be ensured via new and innovative ways;
– At millimeter wave frequencies, there is often a need for wideband ampliﬁers
which are generally more challenging to approach than narrowband ampli-
ﬁers deployed at lower frequency bands;
– Modeling of LNAs and their components needs to be reconsidered for
millimeter-wave frequencies; and
– The distinct lack of proper EDA for LNAs calls for research in this ﬁeld.
This book aims to achieve research impact by answering the following research
questions:

Identifying Research Gaps: Fundamental Principles …

1. How much can understanding of millimeter-wave-frequency operation funda-
mentals and fundamentals of propagation assist in optimum LNA design at these
frequencies?
2. What parameters of state-of-the art LNAs can be improved on by optimization
via more advanced models, whether of complete systems or partial ones?
3. How much can the performance of a typical LNA be improved through
improvement of is building blocks or blocks that precede it: transistors, passives,
packaging, antennas?
4. In which way can efforts to improve EDA assist in achieving optimized LNAs?
The following research hypothesis can be formulated based on the above:
If the performance of an LNA at millimeter-wave frequencies can be dissected into parts
contributing to its performance, then by improving the performance of its parts, improved
performance of the complete LNA system will be achieved.

Contribution to the Body of Knowledge
To the best of the authors’ knowledge, there is only a handful of research texts on
LNAs and texts on LNAs in general [38, 48, 49, 50], some of which were written
more than a decade prior to this publication. This book appears to be the ﬁrst text to
focus largely on the challenges of LNA research and design in the millimeter-wave
regime. Although quite a number of peer-reviewed publications will be referenced
throughout ten chapters of this book, these contributions focus on various parts of
this vast topic. The authors are of the opinion that this book presents by far the most
comprehensive research reference in this ﬁeld to date, illustrating the multidisci-
plinary nature of modern RF engineering, and encompassing topics in semicon-
ductor physics, analog circuit design, communication engineering, packaging and
software engineering.
1.8
Content Overview
In this chapter, some fundamental theory underlying LNAs for millimeter-waves
and LNAs in general has been discussed. The topics included discussions of the role
of an LNA in transceiver systems, active and passive components as applicable to
millimeter-wave designs and practical applications of LNAs, as well as introductory
discussions on fundamental ampliﬁer concepts, such as gain, linearity, noise and
power consumption. This allowed for the formulation of the research questions and
research hypothesis, which is undertaken throughout this book.

Introduction and Research Impact

Wherever possible in this chapter, readers were introduced to later chapters of
the book for more detailed discussions on various topics. This concluding section
continues in that manner with the formalization of the discussed topics.
This chapter gave the reader ample background on the importance of LNAs and
some of the challenges that are unique to millimeter-wave research, and therefore
served to formulate the research questions and establish this book as a compre-
hensive research resource for LNAs that operate in the millimeter-wave regime.
As mentioned in the introductory section of this chapter, the rest of the text is
divided into two parts. The ﬁrst part contextualizes LNA theory and supporting
multidisciplinary concepts, while the second part deals with the state-of-the-art in
LNA research for the millimeter-wave regime and somewhat more advanced topics
associated with LNAs. Most importantly, this part encompasses the suggestions on
LNA optimization in an effort to answer research questions. This includes current
research efforts and future research directions. Part I follows this introductory
chapter.
1.8.1
Part I
Chapter 2 presents a detailed analysis of the current body of knowledge when it
comes to LNAs, speciﬁcally for millimeter-wave applications. This includes the
detailed analysis of two-port modelling, practical means of ampliﬁer analysis, gain
equations, stability issues, various noise aspects, broadband techniques and
ampliﬁer linearity. This is complemented by some telecommunication aspects
associated with LNAs. These include placing the millimeter-wave range in the
context of the other transmission bands and a detailed review of millimeter-wave
prospects, investigation into current antenna efforts and modulation schemes. The
seemingly disjoint topics explored in this chapter illustrate the multidisciplinary
nature of the research in this ﬁeld.
In Chap. 3, the technologies for LNA implementations are discussed. The latest
developments in various high-fT and fMAX transistors are investigated in an attempt
to
evaluate
suitable
semiconductor
devices
for
LNA
implementation
at
millimeter-wave frequencies. This is followed by the complete small-signal model
analysis of both MOSFETs (and variations thereof) and HBTs. Transistor noise
modeling, paramount for LNAs, is also discussed in this chapter and it follows on
the discussion on noise in Chap. 2. Substrates for discrete LNA implementations, as
well as advanced implementations that will be handled in Chap. 8, are also
discussed.
In Chap. 4, the feasibility of passives at frequencies up to millimeter-wave bands
is presented. This includes both lumped passives (resistors, capacitors, inductors)
and transmission-line passives, with some innovative ideas. Traditionally, lumped
passives have been unsuitable for millimeter-wave because of their high parasitics,
but with recent technology improvements, the use of lumped passives is also
possible and will be discussed at some length.
1.8
Content Overview
21

Chapters 5 and 6, the last two chapters of Part I, deal with various LNA con-
ﬁgurations and the design theory of these, devised from ﬁrst principles of ampliﬁer
operation. Techniques such as simultaneous matching for power and noise, as well
as bandwidth enhancement, are discussed in these two chapters for both narrow-
band and wideband applications. The focus of Chap. 5 is mostly on the general
LNA theory as well as narrowband LNAs, whereas the focus of Chap. 6 is on
wideband LNAs, although Chap. 5 also serves as a general introduction to LNAs.
1.8.2
Part II
Part II begins with Chap. 7, in which the state-of-the-art LNA conﬁgurations and
means for their deployment are discussed. This chapter expands on the earlier
chapters by looking at some complex practical LNA conﬁgurations and the latest
research efforts, with the focus on linearization and optimization, exclusively in the
millimeter-wave regime. The chapter also looks at weaknesses of state-of the art
conﬁgurations of most LNAs discussed in Chaps. 5 and 6, therefore opening up
opportunities for looking at ways of optimizing these state-of-the-art conﬁgurations.
The optimization efforts are postponed until Chaps. 8 and 9.
In Chap. 8, the focus shifts towards research areas that are still under devel-
opment. The topics include the inﬂuence of wavelength, layout, crosstalk, bonding
and packaging onto LNA performance, among others. A part of the chapter focuses
on advanced fabrication technologies used to decrease the parasitics of passive and
active devices and therefore to optimize circuits such as LNAs. Different packaging
technologies such as silicon-on-chip, SoP and related technologies are discussed as
alternatives to IC implementation. Minimization of the parasitic effects of passives
by introducing innovative ideas for their construction is another of the topics
explored here. This chapter will also look at alternative design methodologies, such
as LNA/antenna co-design.
Chapter 9 looks at the current extent and availability of EDA for use when
designing LNAs. Ongoing research efforts into automated LNA design and opti-
mization are also investigated. A number of EDA options for high-quality passive
components (inductors), matching, LNAs and even complete receivers will be
proposed.
Chapter 10 summarizes the book by looking at which research questions have
been answered and comments on the hypothesis. It also looks into remaining
research gaps in LNA research for the millimeter-wave regime. Future directions
are also explored in this chapter. The chapter concludes with the authors’ proposal
for the streamlined automated LNA design ﬂow, which focuses on the design of the
LNA as a collection of highly optimized subsystems (parts). The concluding
remarks of the chapter also conclude Part II and this book.

Speciﬁcation-Governed
Telecommunication
and High-Frequency-Electronics Aspects
of Low-Noise Ampliﬁer Research
Abstract The ﬁrst part of this chapter focuses on placing millimeter-wave research
in the context of telecommunication. The second part focuses more strongly on
some high-frequency ampliﬁer electronics that were neglected in Chap. 1. In
essence, this chapter aims to illustrate the convergence of communications, circuits
and antennas, which is necessary in millimeter-wave LNA research. These appar-
ently unrelated aspects of LNA research can furthermore be treated in a single
chapter because they set the research constraints (i.e., result in design speciﬁca-
tions). For example, there may be a requirement for a 60 GHz communication
network deploying a certain type of modulation, but with a particular gain and noise
ﬁgure; this, once again, illustrates the multidisciplinary nature of LNA research.
This chapter will open Part I of the book, the aim of which is to contextualize the
research presented in Part II. It will combine two aspects, both extremely important
in research into LNAs. The ﬁrst part of this chapter will focus on placing
millimeter-wave research in the context of telecommunication. The second part of
the chapter will focus more strongly on some high-frequency ampliﬁer electronics
that were neglected in Chap. 1. In essence, this chapter aims to illustrate the
convergence of communications, circuits and antennas, which is necessary in
millimeter-wave LNA research [1]. These apparently unrelated aspects of LNA
research can furthermore be treated in a single chapter because they set the research
constraints (i.e., result in design speciﬁcations). For example, there may be a
requirement for a 60 GHz communication network deploying a certain type of
modulation, but with a particular gain and noise ﬁgure; this, once again, illustrates
the multidisciplinary nature of LNA research.
This chapter is set to complement the fundamental theory of LNAs introduced in
Chap. 1. The ﬁrst part of the chapter starts with the introduction of the concept of
wavelength, followed by the analysis of the frequency spectrum and various
transmission bands and their implications for transceiver system research. The
millimeter-wave portion of the spectrum itself is quite wide and there are a few
sub-frequency allocations that are the focus of active research and warrant further
discussion. The feasibility of passive component implementations, especially

transmission lines, in each range is investigated further, seeing that the component
size is dependent on wavelength. Various digital modulation schemes, commonly
used in transceiver systems, are also presented in some detail, since the modulation
schemes often steer the direction of research. The ﬁrst part of the chapter also
examines some of the antenna and propagation theory, speciﬁcally as applicable to
millimeter-waves. A typical LNA connects either directly to the antenna or via a
bandpass ﬁlter, and needs to amplify extremely weak and noisy signals and an effort
thus needs to be made to research the antennas as well to avoid introducing
additional attenuation on the receiving antenna.
Secondly, a large part of this chapter investigates high-frequency electronics. In
general, electronics at high frequencies are treated by means of a two-port analysis.
This part of the chapter therefore mostly focuses on the two-port theory as appli-
cable to LNA research. This includes two-port modeling and applicable parameters,
which are important for practical LNA analysis. This is then followed by a dis-
cussion of the ampliﬁer and LNA fundamentals, but mostly structured from the
two-port perspective. This includes various two-port gain equations and the stability
of ampliﬁers. Furthermore, concepts such as two-port impedance matching and
biasing are examined to some extent. Another two very important concepts intro-
duced in Chap. 1 will be investigated here in much detail and from the two-port
perspective: noise and linearity.
2.1
Frequency and Wavelength
Frequency of operation has a major inﬂuence on the behavior of passive and active
devices and thus on any transceiver component that is built to operate at a certain
frequency. Inherently, building LNAs for increased frequencies becomes progres-
sively more challenging.
The active device responsible for the gain of the ampliﬁer is the transistor. If one
looks at the physical structure of the transistor, it is not difﬁcult to identify a number
of parasitic components, primarily capacitors. If these are worked into ampliﬁer
gain equations, they result in a frequency response of the ampliﬁer that is not ﬂat
over all frequencies, but rather starts decreasing with an increase in frequency.
A transistor’s transitional frequency is typically used as the measure of the maxi-
mum frequency at which an ampliﬁer can be designed to operate. This chapter will
assume that a transistor or a technology is chosen such that an active device has a
transitional
frequency,
which
is
going
to
allow
operation
well
into
the
millimeter-wave range (discussed in the following section); thus the performance of
the ampliﬁer is only limited by the performance of the passive components, unless
otherwise stated. Of course this is often untrue, but the issue will be deferred until
later because active devices and their modeling will be researched in Chap. 3 in
great detail.
30

Speciﬁcation-Governed Telecommunication …

When discussing passive components, especially transmission lines, it is
somewhat more important to relate the feasibility of passives to a wavelength. The
size of the antenna also depends on the wavelength, requiring wavelength to be
deﬁned early in this chapter.
The frequency is related to wavelength according to a well-known relation
k ¼ v
f
ð2:1Þ
where v is the phase speed of the wave and f is the wave frequency. The phase
speed of the electromagnetic wave in free space is the speed of light, which is about
3  108 m/s, but decreases in semiconductors or substrates that have relative per-
mittivity of more than 1.0 (slow waves) [1]. At lower frequencies, the wavelengths
of signals are quite large, so the size of the passive electrical components has little
impact on these signals. For example, at 2.4 GHz, a frequency where most com-
mercial WiFi systems operate, the wavelength is 12.5 cm. This means that any
component or a connection should not be greater than a tenth of the wavelength
(12.5 mm) for a system to behave with minimal loss, i.e. so that the wave propa-
gation does not need to be taken into account and transmission lines can be avoided.
This can still be accomplished even on a PCB where tracks are generally longer. At
60 GHz, the wavelength is 5 mm, which means that any connection greater than
one tenth of 5 mm, or 500 lm, has to be treated as a transmission line. This
motivates the on-chip transmission line implementation of passives and matching of
all circuitry.
2.2
Frequency Spectrum and Transmission Bands
Based on the discussion in the previous section, at a frequency of 30 GHz, the
wavelength of a transmitted signal has a value of 1 cm. This value has made it
convenient for this point in the spectrum to be taken as the transition between
microwave and millimeter-wave ranges. Similarly, the frequency of 3 GHz
(k = 10 cm)
was
taken
as
the
transition
between
RF
and
microwave.
Coincidentally, transceivers constructed by lumped elements can be more compact
than designs based on transmission lines up to the higher end of the RF range,
whether built on chip or off chip (discrete implementation). Above 30 GHz, or in
millimeter-wave range, transmission lines and waveguides are more practical (albeit
with some exceptions generally for good lumped component designs, as discussed
later in Chap. 4), even on chip. Furthermore, transceivers and their elements require
accurate modeling and high-precision manufacturing in this range. The microwave
range, squeezed between 3 and 30 GHz, presents almost a “gray area” of ampliﬁer
design, where both lumped and transmission-line implementations are possible,
depending on the application and methodology and whether the system is imple-
mented on chip, on package or on a PCB.
2.1
Frequency and Wavelength
31

Research into LNA and other transceiver components regularly leads to articles
that use alternative, more detailed nomenclature of the frequency spectrum division
(that is other than RF, microwave and millimeter-wave), and all these deﬁnitions
may be confusing to the reader. Thus the classiﬁcation of the different bands in the
frequency spectrum is beneﬁcial for understanding LNA design and applications
and is included in this section. Frequency bands are deﬁned by the international
telecommunication union (ITU) [2]. The frequency spectrum is illustrated in
Table 2.1. The same table also summarizes the feasibility of passives in each
frequency range.
The lower end of the spectrum, that is, the ELF, VF and VLF ranges, spans from
30 Hz to 30 kHz, contains audible frequencies and is thus unsuitable for radio
transmission. Low frequencies (LF) span from 30 to 300 kHz and are used for
long-range navigation, submarine communication and telegraphy. Medium fre-
quencies (MF) or medium waves span from 300 kHz to 3 MHz and are used for
commercial radio. The high-frequency (HF) range with frequencies from 3 to
30 MHz is used for military tactical radios and by amateur radio operators because
of the long-distance propagation properties of the 30-m-long waves.
The very-high-frequency (VHF) range with frequencies from 30 to 300 MHz
and the ultra-high-frequency (UHF) range with frequencies from 300 MHz to
3 GHz are used for television and radio broadcast, cordless and cellular telephone
transmission, as well as for other wireless applications, such as wireless local area
networks (WLANs) and Bluetooth®. These bands are also suitable for industrial
heating and microwave ovens.
The higher end of the spectrum comprises of super-high-frequency (SHF) and
extra-high frequency (EHF) bands. The SHF range includes frequencies from 3 to
30 GHz and the EHF range includes frequencies from 30 to 300 GHz. These two
ranges are mostly used for satellite communication and radar applications, but as
mentioned in Chap. 1, millimeter-waves have great potential for other commercial
applications. The terahertz range is currently used mostly for ﬁber communications,
and infrared remote controls, such as the remote controls for television.
More precise frequency division based on the letters of the alphabet is sometimes
used for the UHF, SHF and EHF frequency bands. The L-band spans from 1 to
2 GHz, the S-band spans from 2 to 4 GHz, the C-band spans from 4 to 8 GHz and
the X-band spans from 8 to 12 GHz. The next band is typically divided into three
bands, the Ku, K and Ka bands, where “u” stands for “under” and “a” stands for
“above”. The Ku band spans from 12 to 18 GHz, the K band from 18 to 26.5 GHz
and the Ka-band from 26.5 to 40 GHz. The top part of the Ka-band is already in the
millimeter range, together with the V-band (40–75 GHz) and W-band (75–
110 GHz). The D-band starts at 110 GHz.
Electronic circuitry and the required IC technologies for applications above
110 GHz are still in the early phases of research, and it remains customary to refer
to any range above 110 GHz as simply the millimeter-wave range, or if the
application is above 300 GHz, the sub-terahertz range. The sub-terahertz range
coincides with the far-infrared range, which is one decade lower than the infrared
range and two decades lower than visible light.

Frequency Spectrum and Transmission Bands
33

As discussed in the opening sections of this book, the main focus is on
millimeter-wave frequencies. However, this frequency range is so wide that it is
necessary to focus more speciﬁcally on the particular parts of the millimeter-wave
spectrum. This will be handled in the following section.
2.3
The Millimeter-Wave Frequency Range
As seen in the previous section, the millimeter-wave part of the electromagnetic
spectrum, or EHF, according to the deﬁnition by the ITU, spans the frequency range
of 30–300 GHz. Being one of the least explored frequency bands, its use across the
world is not standardized, and therefore in different countries, different amounts of
bandwidth are available in different frequency groups, which is typically regulated
on government level. Nevertheless, the amount of bandwidth available is still much
more than in UHF and SHF, where the communication networks of today (WiFi,
global positioning system, cellular) primarily operate.
One of the main considerations in millimeter-wave research regarding the
abundance of bandwidth allocation is millimeter-wave propagation. The amount of
atmospheric attenuation increases with frequencies, albeit with some exceptions.
2.3.1
Millimeter-Wave Bandwidth Allocations
Frequency allocation remains one of the major bottlenecks of millimeter-wave
research. Even though, by deﬁnition, the millimeter-wave range spans a total
bandwidth of 270 GHz, only a small percentage of the total frequency allocation is
typically available without the need for licensing, which is an incentive for research
into commercial applications. If one considers the frequency distribution as the one
shown in Fig. 2.1 [3], it appears that only two bands are available, one centered at
60 GHz and the second one at 180 GHz. This leaves about 225 GHz of bandwidth
that is unused.

The largest research effort into millimeter-wave communication went into the
unlicensed 60-GHz band, even though this band suffers from large amounts of
oxygen attenuation, an aspect that will be discussed later. Europe allows trans-
missions between 57 and 66 GHz, which translates to a 9-GHz range. This, as
mentioned before, is not standardized across the world, and the United States of
America (USA), for example, allows 2 GHz less, that is, transmission between 57
and 64 GHz. Channels are typically just over 2 GHz, with top and bottom guards of
240 and 120 MHz respectively [4], as illustrated in Fig. 2.2. The ﬁrst standard
governing bandwidth usage around 60 GHz was the IEEE 802.11ad standard [5].
The 60-GHz band is also used for satellite applications. Beyond 60 GHz,
however, there are some reserved frequency allocations. For example, it was
already mentioned in Chap. 1 that the 77 GHz (76–77 GHz) band is utilized for
automotive radar and safety applications. Automotive radar application around
77 GHz quickly gained popularity for several reasons (previously, automotive radar
used the 24 GHz band) [6]. Firstly, the size of the radar antenna allowed for
seamless integration into, for example, the bumpers of vehicles [7]. Secondly, the
millimeter-wave propagation characteristics at these frequencies allowed for prac-
tical narrow beams. Finally, the amount of radiated power allowed in this band is
also greater.
In Europe, the 77–81 GHz window is allocated for UWB short-range radar.
77-GHz bands are sometimes also used for millimeter-wave imagining. Imaging is
sometimes also done around 94 GHz, where oxygen attenuation exhibits the local
minimum.
Furthermore, the band around 40 GHz is used for licensed high-speed micro-
wave data links in the USA. The 71–76, 81–86 and 92–95 GHz bands are also used
for point-to-point communication links because the oxygen attenuation is not as
prominent as in the 60 GHz band, but licensing is needed. Other millimeter-wave
frequencies are typically used for radio astronomy.

2.3.2
Propagation of Millimeter Waves
For transmission above 30 MHz, propagation is possible only by line-of sight
waves [8]. There are two types of these waves: direct waves and ground-reﬂected
waves. Most of the transmission at millimeter-wave frequencies are accomplished
by direct waves. Propagation of the waves is inﬂuenced by different types of losses,
including space loss, atmospheric loss, polarization mismatch loss, impedance
mismatch loss and pointing loss.
It is a common misconception that propagation of the waves is inﬂuenced by
frequency, in other words that as the frequency increases, the waves cannot
propagate as well [3]. One counter-argument to that is the size of the antenna; as
will be the seen later in this chapter, the required size of the antenna is proportional
to the wavelength and therefore at millimeter-wave frequencies, as waveforms
decrease, so does the size of the antenna, and more antennas can be packed into a
smaller space.
The concept of the increase of the number of antennas in the millimeter waves is
closely related to the directivity of the millimeter-wave beam. It is possible to build
highly directional antennas, resulting in narrow transmitted beams. This allows for
more channels to be present in a small geographical area, thus increasing overall data
throughput. This is best understood if the size of the millimeter-wave beam is
compared to the size of, for example, a microwave beam, as illustrated in Fig. 2.3 [9].
Despite these advantages, the atmospheric loss does tend to limit the range of
millimeter-wave communication. This is mostly due to the absorption of atmo-
spheric gases. Oxygen (O2) absorption is coincidentally most prominent at 60 GHz
(around the range of the unlicensed bands both in Europe and the USA) with an
attenuation of over 10 dB/km. Water vapor (H2O) absorption also inﬂuences the
propagation, but it is more prominent above 100 GHz. Atmospheric attenuation of
electromagnetic waves is well researched and is usually represented by the atten-
uation curves 8 depicted in Fig. 2.4.

Precipitation is also something that causes attenuation. This is due to the fact that
the electromagnetic waves are scattered by raindrops. Consider, for example,
applications above 70 GHz where oxygen attenuation is negligible. Here, com-
munication would be seriously disrupted by precipitation, with the attenuation
ﬁgures as shown in Table 2.2 [9].
Signal loss due to atmospheric conditions therefore allows reliable outdoor
communication to ranges of only a few kilometers.
Another major cause of loss in millimeter-waves is multipath interference. This
results in reﬂections and scattering. Scattering arises in response to sizes of objects
that are physically similar to the wavelength, while reﬂection occurs if waves reach
objects that are larger in size than the wavelength. With millimeter waves, where
wavelengths are smaller than 10 mm, most objects act as reﬂectors. This is why the
line of sight, mentioned at the beginning of this section, is so important. Hence this
also inﬂuences the environmental use of this frequency band i.e. for indoor or
outdoor propagation. Careful selection of both transmit and receive antennas can
help alleviate the multipath issue to some extent [10].

Digital Modulation Schemes for Millimeter-Wave
Applications
In Chap. 1, two block diagrams were presented: one of the complete transmitter/
receiver, and one of the zero-IF direct conversion transmitter. One aspect common
to both diagrams was that both introduced the concept of modulation. Modulation
implies that properties of the carrier signal, i.e. the signal that can physically be
ampliﬁed and transmitted, are varied so that the information of interest is super-
imposed [11, 12]. Thus, before a signal is transmitted, a certain modulation scheme
needs to be deployed. On the receiver’s side, the signal is demodulated, therefore
the LNA is required to amplify the received signal, while retaining the properties of
the signal achieved by modulation. Modulation is accomplished by means of a
modulator. On the receiver side, a demodulator is used to recover the same
information.
Modern telecommunication systems are moving from employing analog mod-
ulation towards employing digital modulation, and this is especially true for the
millimeter-wave range. In a digital modulation scheme, the carrier signal is mod-
ulated by a discrete signal. To fully understand the requirements of the design of an
LNA for a particular application that may be of interest to the reader, at least
minimal understanding of the modulation scheme that is deployed is required, and
therefore, various digital modulation schemes are discussed in this review. The
modulation schemes listed below all have different bandwidth utilization efﬁciency:
• On-off keying (OOK);
• Phase-shift keying (PSK);
• Frequency-shift keying (FSK);
• Pulse-amplitude modulation (PAM);
• Quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM);
• Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM); and
• Various direct-sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) techniques.
OOK, PSK, PAM and QAM are referred to as single-carrier modulation
schemes. FSK and OFDM are examples of multi-carrier modulation schemes.
DSSS refers to methods by which a speciﬁc bandwidth signal is intentionally spread
in the frequency domain by using a spreading sequence, resulting in a signal with a
wider bandwidth. This is done for various reasons, most often to make the signal
less prone to noise or to prevent unintended detection [13]. Because of its com-
plexity, the discussion on the DSSS will be omitted.
If the mapping of the digital sequence is performed without requiring the
information on the previously transmitted signals, then the modulation is memo-
ryless. By deﬁnition then, all the modulation schemes discussed here are
memoryless.

Speciﬁcation-Governed Telecommunication …

2.4.1
On-Off Keying
OOK is the simplest digital modulation technique. In this scheme, the presence of
the carrier indicates a digital one (1), and the absence of the signal indicates a digital
zero (0), as illustrated in Fig. 2.5. Because of its simplicity, the data transfer rates
that can be achieved with OOK are the same as BPSK, and thus, in millimeter-wave
applications, more complex modulation techniques are typically used, such as the
ones discussed in subsequent sections.
2.4.2
Phase Shift-Keying
If the digital signal is modulated onto the carrier by changing its phase, then PSK is
accomplished. A ﬁnite number of phases (M) is used, usually two (0 and 180°) for
bits 0 and 1 (BPSK), four (0, 90°, 180°, 270°) for bit combinations 00, 01, 10 and
11 (QPSK) or eight for eight three-bit combinations (octal PSK). If the signal pulse
has the shape deﬁned by g(t), then M signals waveforms (symbols) are represented
by
smðtÞ ¼ gðtÞ cos 2p
M ðm  1Þ cos 2pfct  gðtÞ sin 2p
M ðm  1Þ sin 2pfct
ð2:2Þ
for m = 1, 2,…, M, 0  t  T, where fc is the carrier and T is the period of the
signal. A typical waveform of the QPSK-modulated signal is shown in Fig. 2.6.
Complex modulation schemes are often also represented by signal space diagrams
or constellations. Constellations of BPSK, QPSK and octal PSK are shown in
Fig. 2.7.
The bandwidth utilization efﬁciency of BPSK is 1 bps/Hz, but the bandwidth
increases as the complexity of modulation is increased. For example, in the 60-GHz
band, a data rate of 3.5 Gb/s can be achieved by QPSK in a 2.16-GHz channel [14].

Frequency Shift-Keying
If the digital information is modulated onto the carrier by changing its frequency
(e.g. by deploying two LOs), then FSK is accomplished. Normally, it is not
practical to use more than two frequencies to represent 0 and 1, which results in
binary FSK. An FSK-modulated signal is illustrated in Fig. 2.8.

2.4.4
Pulse-Amplitude Modulation
If the digital signal is encoded as the amplitude in series of pulses, then PAM is
achieved. M signal waveforms can be represented as
smðtÞ ¼ AmgðtÞ cos 2pfct
ð2:3Þ
for m = 1, 2,…, M, 0  t  T, where Am is the signal amplitude that can take
discrete levels
Am ¼ ð2m  1  MÞd:
ð2:4Þ
In the previous equation, the value of 2d is deﬁned as the distance on the
amplitude axis between two signal amplitudes. PAM is illustrated in Fig. 2.9.
As with PSK, one-bit, two-bit or three-bit symbol combinations are suitable for
practical implementation. This corresponds to M = 2, 4 and 8 respectively.
Constellations for 2-PAM, 4-PAM and 8 PAM are illustrated in Fig. 2.10.
2.4.5
Quadrature Amplitude Modulation
QAM can be used as a technique for bandwidth efﬁciency improvement. In this
modulation scheme, two or more separately modulated signals are combined on the
carriers that are out of phase. In essence, this results in a combination of a PSK
scheme with another scheme, usually PAM. For example, if PAM containing M1
amplitude levels is combined with PSK with M2 phases, the resulting signal con-
stellation will have M = M1M2 waveforms. Mathematically, this can be represented
by

for m = 1, 2,…, M, 0  t  T, where Amc and Ams are information-bearing signal
amplitudes of the quadrature carriers and g(t) is the signal pulse once more. The
signal constellations are illustrated in Fig. 2.11.
For example, 16-QAM can achieve 7 Gb/s data transfer rate in the 60-GHz band
with 2.16 GHz of bandwidth [14]. This is double the data rate that can be achieved
by QPSK, but there are several challenges in realizing 16-QAM direct-conversion
transceivers, since the carrier-to-noise ratio requirement is much larger than that of
QPSK.
2.4.6
Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing
OFDM is a technique that is often used to achieve high data transmission rates. This
is accomplished by transmitting data over a large number of carriers simultaneously
rather than using a single carrier with a high data rate. This scheme is practical for
application such as HDTV or LTE networks in RF and microwave frequency
ranges, and for high-data-rate transmissions in 60 GHz millimeter-wave band.

OFDM incorporates the same modulation scheme around same-amplitude carriers
separated in frequency only enough so that intermodulation products arising from
one frequency are negligible at the frequencies of the other carriers. Generating
these carrier signals consists of inverse fast Fourier transform (FFT) operations on
blocks of M symbols at the transmitter, and they are extracted at the receiver by
performing FFTs on blocks comprised of M discrete samples [15–17]. OFDM is
particularly prone to nonlinear distortion that is caused in the transmitter.
2.5
Antennas for Millimeter-Waves
In a transmitter, after modulation and power ampliﬁcation, the ampliﬁed signal is
passed on to an antenna, which is used to radiate the electromagnetic energy into
the channel effectively [18]. Such an antenna is referred to as the transmitting
antenna. On the receiving side, receiving antennas are used for receiving the
electromagnetic energy from the channel. Fundamentally, an antenna is a bidirec-
tional (reciprocal) device [3]. This means that an identical antenna may be used for
both transmit and receive functions. A transmitter antenna radiates spherical waves.
At some distance from the antenna, the spherical waves can be approximated with
plane waves, which simpliﬁes the antenna analysis, and that region is normally
referred to as the far-ﬁeld of the antenna.
Although antennas are, strictly speaking, passive components, and should

2.5.1
General Antenna Theory
When analyzing electronic circuitry, the antenna is typically modeled by a resistor
with a value of 50 Ω. This is possible because each antenna has a characteristic
impedance. The low characteristic impedance value of 50 Ω has become standard
because it allows a high amount of power to be transferred from the transmitter to
the antenna, if the output stage (the power ampliﬁer) is properly matched to the
antenna. The same happens on the receiving side, where the aim is to transfer a lot
of power to the ﬁrst block in the receiver, typically an LNA.
Another important concept of antenna design is antenna efﬁciency. Antenna
efﬁciency can be deﬁned similar to the efﬁciency of the ampliﬁer, and in the case of
the transmitting antenna it represents the ratio of radiated power to the power fed to
the antenna [19]:
gA ¼ PRAD
PFED
:
ð2:6Þ
The efﬁciency of the receiving antenna can be deﬁned similarly as the ratio of
the absorbed power to the power transferred to the ﬁrst stage of the receiver.
Also similar to an ampliﬁer, an antenna is typically designed to have a certain
amount of gain. Gain of the transmitting antenna in a particular direction is typically
denoted by GT, while that of the receiving antenna is denoted by GR. With this
deﬁned, the power density at the distance r from the antenna can be computed, and
is
pðrÞ ¼ GT
PT
4pr2 ;
ð2:7Þ
where PT is the transmitted power. From this equation, it is evident that the power
density decreases quadratically with the distance, and consequently that high gains
are needed to transmit over long distances. The amount of power received by the
antenna on the receiver side with gain GR is given by the Friis formula
PR ¼ PTGTGRkn
ð4prÞn
;
ð2:8Þ
where n = 2. The above formula is only valid if there is a direct line of sight
between the transmitter and receiver. In practice, however, there is more than one
propagation path between the transmitter and receiver, which means that n in
Eq. (2.8) needs to be adjusted for different path losses. Exponent n typically ranges
from 1.7 measured indoor, to 5, measured in suburban areas [20].
The length of an antenna, as discussed before, is related to the signal wave-
length. The length becomes very important when considering packaging. If an
antenna is placed in air, the length of the antenna is simply equal to the wavelength.
44
2
Speciﬁcation-Governed Telecommunication …

However, if the antenna can be printed in a package, then the length of the antenna
scales according to the following equation [21]:
l ¼
kﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
lrer
p
;
ð2:9Þ
where lr and er are the relative permeability and permittivity of the substrate on
which the antenna is printed, respectively. This allows antennas to be printed in SoP
solutions at microwave, and even in integrated circuit packages. Different substrates
allow for antennas with different lengths to be placed in different packages.
High-gain antennas can be built by increasing the antenna size to several
wavelengths.
An antenna also has radiation characteristics, which are mostly determined by its
length and the way in which it is excited. The principle of antenna operation is
based on the Ampere-Maxwell’s law:
D  H ¼ J þ @D
@t ;
ð2:10Þ
where @D
@t is the displacement current (D is the maximum dimension of the antenna),
J(t) is the time varying current density and H(t) is the time varying magnetic ﬁeld
around the antenna. The radiation pattern is normally plotted separately for the
horizontal and vertical dimensions. The antenna pattern exhibits several distinct
lobes that peak in different directions. The largest of these lobes is known as the
main beam, and the others are referred to as sidelobes.
If a lot of antenna power can be concentrated into one direction, then a direc-
tional antenna is built and the concept is referred to as directivity. Highly directional
antennas are known as pencil beam antennas and the directivity of the pencil beam
antenna can be approximated if the beamwidths in both the horizontal and vertical
directions (h1 and h2 respectively, expressed in rad) are known:
D  32;400
h1h2
:
ð2:11Þ
Directivity is thus a dimensionless quantity and is sometimes expressed in dB.
For directional antennas, the gain of the antenna can be expressed in terms of
antenna efﬁciency and directivity:
G ¼ gAD:
ð2:12Þ
2.5.2
Millimeter-Wave Antennas
Various types of antennas are commonly used [8]:
2.5
Antennas for Millimeter-Waves
45

• Wire antennas (dipoles, monopoles and others) with low gains, used mostly at
HF to UHF;
• Aperture antennas (open-ended waveguides, horns, reﬂectors) with moderate to
high gains, used in microwave bands; and
• Printed antennas on various substrates (slots, dipoles or microstrip) with high
gains and also used in microwave bands.
As discussed before, several antennas can be combined in antenna arrays in
order to obtain more directivity and other desirable properties.
Millimeter-wave antennas are typically built by scaling the antennas built for
lower than millimeter-wave frequencies [3]. Aperture and printed antennas are both
suitable for scaling.
Slot Arrays
Applications that require an antenna with a steerable, directional pattern and a
reasonable gain typically utilize slot array antennas. Power delivered to the antenna
is thus radiated from the slot openings machined into waveguides into free space.
Millimeter-wave antennas typically use substrate-integrated waveguides (SIWs).
Horn Antennas
SIWs can also be used in the design of horn antennas. Horn antennas can achieve
high gain and high power by using narrow beamwidths. At millimeter-waves, horn
antennas can typically be made more efﬁcient than lower frequency antennas.
Microstrip Antennas
Printed antennas, including microstrip antennas, usually exhibit high losses when
used with millimeter-waves. Specialized fabrication techniques are generally
required to design well-performing antennas. Although with wavelength scaling
these antennas can be used in ICs if only size is a concern, implementation of the
antennas is more suitable for packaging solutions for SoP.
Leaky Wave Antennas
Leaky wave antennas use the fact that radiation originates from structures where the
ﬁrst of the higher order modes is known to appear at high frequencies. Leaky waves
can be generated in closed waveguides by perturbing the aperture with tapered slots
or any type of open aperture. At millimeter-wave frequencies, dielectric rod
antennas, non-radiative dielectric guide antennas, tapered slot antennas, partially
reﬂective surface patches and printed log-periodic dipole arrays can all be used.
Dielectric Resonator Antennas
Dielectric resonators yield greater radiation efﬁciencies than microstrip antennas.
These antennas can thus be used in ICs, but the nature of their fabrication process
introduces certain complexities.

High-Frequency Electronics: Practical Two-Port
Modeling of Low-Noise Ampliﬁers
Two-port modeling of an ampliﬁer and consequently LNAs is sometimes necessary
as a starting point for ampliﬁer research or design. In LF design, experience has
shown that admittance parameters (Y-) proved practical, while at microwave and
millimeter-wave frequencies, measuring ampliﬁer response becomes more mean-
ingful if the scattering (S-) parameters are deployed. Sometimes it makes more
sense to use impedance (Z-) parameters when describing LNAs, speciﬁcally the
input impedance of an LNA. Admittance, impedance and scattering parameters all
describe the ampliﬁer unambiguously.
2.6.1
Admittance Parameters
Admittance is deﬁned as the reciprocal of the impedance [22]:
Y ¼ 1
Z ¼ G  jB;
ð2:13Þ
where G is the conductance and B is the susceptance, both expressed in siemens (S).
An ampliﬁer as a two-port black box with Y-parameters is shown in Fig. 2.12,
where I1 and V1 are the input current and voltage respectively and I2 and V2 are the
output current and voltage respectively, and [Y] denotes the admittance matrix, i.e.
the 2-by-2 matrix incorporating all four two-port admittance parameters. The
short-circuit Y-parameters are then by deﬁnition:

where yi is the short-circuit input admittance, yr is the short-circuit reverse transfer

short-circuit output admittance. Thus,
I1 ¼ yiV1 þ yrV2;
ð2:18Þ
and
I2 ¼ yf V1 þ yoV2:

Z-parameters are easily deﬁned in the same manner, except that the analysis has

S-parameters are much easier to measure and work with than Y- and Z-parameters.
S-parameters are also more intuitive than Y- and Z-parameters, since they are the
measure of the reﬂection and gain, as opposed to being a measure of just an abstract
quantity such as admittance. The beneﬁts of this approach will become apparent
later when gain, stability and matching are discussed. S-parameters can be deﬁned
with the aid of Fig. 2.13, where incident and reﬂected traveling waves are shown in
relation to the scattering matrix [S]. A traveling wave has the following charac-
teristics [22]:

1. A part of the traveling wave originating from the source and incident upon the
two-port device (a1) will be reﬂected as b1 and another part will be transmitted
through the two-port device;
2. A part of the transmitted signal is reﬂected from the load and becomes incident
upon the output of the two-port device (a2); and
3. A part of the signal (a2) is reﬂected from the output port back toward the load as
b2 and another part is transmitted through the two-port device back to the
source.
This requires two reﬂection coefﬁcients (S11 and S22) and two gain coefﬁcients.
Thus, the input port reﬂection coefﬁcient S11 is deﬁned as
S11 ¼ b1

Conversion between Y-parameters and S-parameters is fairly simple but is typ-

Practical Ampliﬁer Gain Relationships and Stability
Ampliﬁer power gain was already deﬁned in the introductory chapter:
G ¼ PL
Pin
:
ð2:26Þ
The gain in Eq. (2.26) is a dimensionless quantity (ratio), but in many instances,
it is useful to convert the gain into decibels, or dB, where G(dB) = 10 log G. Power
quantities then need to be expressed in dBm or dBW, that is, power in decibels
normalized to 1 mW or 1 W respectively.
The power gain can be the result of voltage gain, current gain or both. Typically,
voltage gain is associated with LNAs, and it is simply the ratio of the voltage
delivered to the load from the input voltage:
Av ¼ vL
vin
:
ð2:27Þ
This section introduces two more gain deﬁnitions that are used in addition to the
power gain relationship deﬁned in Eq. (2.26); these are the available gain GA and
transducer gain GT. Furthermore, ampliﬁer stability is closely related to gain and the
two concepts are usually treated together [23]. Practical gain deﬁnitions, however,
require familiarity with reﬂection coefﬁcients and thus the concept of the reﬂection
coefﬁcient is introduced ﬁrst.
2.7.1
Reﬂection Coefﬁcients
A two-port LNA model showing the scattering matrix and reﬂection coefﬁcients is
shown in Fig. 2.14. Symbols ZS, Z0 and ZL denote the source impedance, two-port
network characteristic impedance and load impedance, respectively, and vS repre-
sents the source voltage.
The reﬂection coefﬁcient is a parameter that describes how much of an elec-
tromagnetic power is reﬂected by an impedance discontinuity, and thus it can be

expressed in terms of impedances. In Fig. 2.14, the reﬂection coefﬁcient seen
looking at the source is deﬁned as:
CS ¼ ZS  Z0
ZS þ Z0
:
ð2:28Þ
Similarly, the reﬂection coefﬁcient seen looking at the load is deﬁned as
CL ¼ ZL  Z0
ZL þ Z0
:
ð2:29Þ
To compute the input and output reﬂection coefﬁcients, the S-parameters of the
system also need to be known. The input reﬂection coefﬁcient is dependent on the
reﬂection at the load, which gives
Cin ¼ S11 þ S12S21CL
1  S22CL
:
ð2:30Þ
Similarly, the output reﬂection coefﬁcient is dependent on the reﬂection at the
source:
Cout ¼ S22 þ S12S21CS

:
ð2:31Þ
2.7.2
Gain Relationships
The available power gain describes the relationship between the power presented to
the network PN and the power available from the source PA, and is computed as
GA ¼ PN
PA
:
ð2:32Þ
The transducer power gain GT is deﬁned as the ratio between the power deliv-
ered to the load and the power available from the source:
GT ¼ PL
PA
:
ð2:33Þ
The gain of the complete ampliﬁer network is maximized when the source and
load networks are both conjugately matched to the inputs and outputs of the
two-port network, resulting in G = GA = GT.

It should be noted here that the power relations are written in terms of the source
voltage vs, which is independent of the impedances at the load or the input to the
ampliﬁer. This causes power relation equations to be voltage-speciﬁc. Similarly,
power to the load can be computed as

To compute the available power gain, it is required to obtain the expression for
PA, as well as the expression for PN. The power available from the source is the
maximum power that can be delivered to the network, which is achieved when the
input impedance to the ampliﬁer (Zin) is conjugately matched to the impedance of
the source, and consequently, when Cin ¼ C

In some special cases, the input and output sections of the ampliﬁer are matched
for zero reﬂection, as opposed to conjugate matching.
This results in

ð2:43Þ
As a result, the transducer gain equation simpliﬁes to
GT ¼ jS21j2

in Chap. 1. The last few expressions therefore explain the ofﬁcial naming of S-
parameters as discussed earlier.

2.7.3
Ampliﬁer Stability
Depending on frequency and termination, a two-port ampliﬁer can become unstable
and begin to oscillate. Therefore, any ampliﬁer must also meet stability conditions
in the frequency range of interest.
If a new quantity D is deﬁned in terms of S-parameters as
D ¼ S11S22  S12S21
ð2:47Þ
then, after some manipulation, Cin and Cout can be expressed as
Cin ¼ S11  CLD

ð2:48Þ
and
Cout ¼ S22  CSD

respectively.
Conditional stability implies that the magnitudes of all reﬂection coefﬁcients are
less than unity. In other words,
jCLj\1; jCSj\1; jCinj\1; jCoutj\1:
ð2:50Þ
The theory of stability circles can assist in determining unconditional stability.
The system will be unconditionally stable if

[ 1
ð2:51Þ
and
jDj\1:
ð2:52Þ
Quantity k introduced in Eq. (2.51) is called the stability or Rollett factor.
In packaged devices, package parasitics need to be included in the stability
measurement or calculation. In practice, LNAs experience linear stability phe-
nomena, therefore the non-linear stability issues are sometimes not analyzed [24].
On the other hand, in multi-stage ampliﬁer designs, it may not be sufﬁcient just to
conﬁrm the global stability; one might also need to conﬁrm the stability of various
LNA stages. This can be done through simulations and measurement; in the case of
the latter, probe points on the actual circuit need to be inserted.

Impedance Matching
In this section, impedance matching for maximum power transfer will be discussed,
following the introductory impedance matching discussion in Chap. 1. Figure 2.15
shows a block diagram of an LNA illustrating matching on the input and output
side. At millimeter-wave frequencies, where wavelengths are correspondingly
small, matching can be accomplished with transmission lines [2]. Matching using
lumped components can be deployed as well, once again noting the limitations
discussed in Chap. 1, and later in Chap. 4.
2.8.1
Lumped Element Matching
In case of lumped component matching, two-component networks (L networks) and
three-component networks (T and P networks) are commonly used. Eight
L-network conﬁgurations are possible, as shown in Fig. 2.16a and b, where X1 and
X2 (where X is the reactance of a component) can be any combination of inductors
and capacitors, ZS is the source impedance and ZL is the load impedance. Such an L
network is a broadband (either high-pass or low-pass) network. Conversely, the T
and P networks with passives X1, X2 and X3, shown in Fig. 2.17a and b are
narrowband networks.
For maximum power transfer matching, any type of network can give a perfect
match (zero reﬂection) at a single frequency, but multiple-element networks are
fairly complex to analyze analytically, thus multiple-element tuning is usually
performed graphically with the aid of Smith charts, or using computer-based

analysis. The main advantage of introducing multiple-element networks over
two-element networks is that with these networks, which can be understood as a
combination of several simpler networks, different bandwidths can be achieved.
As seen when the ampliﬁer gain was discussed, for RF, microwave or
millimeter-wave circuits, the maximum power transfer theorem states that the
maximum power is transferred when the load impedance is equal to the complex
conjugate of the source impedance. So, if the source impedance is ZS = RS + jXS,
the load needs to be made to look like ZS
* = RS −jXS, resulting in the process called
conjugate matching. When the source and load are both real quantities (ZS = RS,
ZL = RL), an analytical solution to the matching problem is fairly simple.
For the simplest matching network (L-network) where each network consists of
one capacitor and one inductor, one in shunt (parallel) and the other one in series
with either the source or the load, as illustrated in Fig. 2.18, the matching procedure
is as described below. If we deﬁne Qs as the Q-factor of the series element and Qp
as the Q-factor of the shunt respectively, with
Qs ¼ Xs
Rs
ð2:53Þ
and
Qp ¼ Rp

ð2:54Þ
where Rp is the parallel resistance and Rs is the series resistance, then a generic

is a design equation that can be used to calculate the required Q-factor of the whole
network, and from there, the reactances Xs and Xp of each of the two matching
elements. The result of Eq. (2.55) implies that the designer has no control over the
Q-factor of the matching network. If a precise Q-factor value is required, a
multi-element network has to be used.
The condition Rp > Rs means that for a solution to be possible, a parallel
component needs to be placed next to the larger of the two resistance values (RS or
RL).
Reactances are calculated with the aid of the following two equations. If the
element is an inductor, then
L ¼
X
2pf0
ð2:56Þ
and if the element is a capacitor,
C ¼
1
2pf0X ;
ð2:57Þ
where f0 is the operating frequency.
Maximum power transfer matching of complex lumped L-networks, as well as
real or complex T or P-networks discussed earlier, or networks involving even
more elements, becomes progressively more complicated, and is done either
graphically or with the help of EDA and will not be discussed further in this book.
2.8.2
Transmission-Line Matching
Another way to match impedances in an LNA system is with the aid of transmission
lines.
As
with
lumped-element
matching
networks,
several
variations
of
transmission-line matching networks are available. Typically, microstrip lines or
waveguides are used. Microstrip transmission lines are characterized by the char-
acteristic impedance (typically Z0) and the transmission line length l, which will be
discussed in Chap. 4. These parameters therefore allow for at least the following
matching options:
• Matching networks based on parallel single-stub microstrip lines with ﬁxed or
different characteristic impedances;
• Matching networks based on double parallel stub microstrip lines;
• Matching based on a series stub transmission line (only twin conductor trans-
mission lines); and
2.8
Impedance Matching
57

• Matching networks involving a quarter-wavelength transformer.
Matching networks with a combination of lumped elements and transmission
lines are also sometimes deployed. Figures 2.19, 2.20 and 2.21 show some
examples of matching networks.
A special type of matching network can be created if the length of the microstrip
line is one quarter of the wavelength, as illustrated in Fig. 2.22. In that case, a
quarter-wave transformer is created. The input impedance of a quarter wave
transformer with characteristic impedance Z1, connected to another transmission
line with characteristic impedance Z0, will be shown in Chap. 4 to be Zin = Z1
2/ZL.

2.8.3
Matching and Constant Voltage Standing Wave Ratio
Another system speciﬁcation that should be addressed by the impedance networks
is a voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR) restriction at the input and output ports of
the ampliﬁer. The VSWR speciﬁcation would typically come from the antenna or
the circuit following the LNA.
If the reﬂection coefﬁcient looking into the matching network from the source
side is CIMN, the input VSWR can be computed with
VSWRIMN ¼ 1 þ jCIMNj
1  jCIMNj :
ð2:58Þ
Similarly, if the reﬂection coefﬁcient looking into the matching network from the
source side is COUT, the output VSWR can be computed with
VSWROMN ¼ 1 þ jCOMNj
1  jCOMNj :
ð2:59Þ
2.9
Biasing
Although strictly speaking, biasing is not a two-port concept, it is very closely
related to impedance matching. The input impedance matching, mentioned in the
previous section, ensures that the correct AC signals appear at the input of an LNA.
In addition to matching, biasing at the input is important to set the correct DC
operating point. Therefore, biasing provides the appropriate quiescent point for the
LNA [23].
A well-designed biasing network will ensure that the quiescent point of each
transistor in an LNA remains relatively constant despite parameter variations or
temperature ﬂuctuations. Active and passive biasing networks are possible.
Figure 2.23 shows one-resistor and three-resistor biasing networks commonly used
with MOS LNAs.

Broadband Ampliﬁer Techniques
In Chap. 1 it was discussed that increasing the bandwidth of an LNA increases its
reusability in numerous applications. As will be seen in later chapters of this book,
LNAs for millimeter-wave applications with bandwidths greater than 20 GHz have
been reported [25]. In order for the ampliﬁer to be a truly wideband ampliﬁer, gain
needs to remain ﬂat and matching needs to be constant over the whole band of
interest. As the required bandwidth increases, this becomes increasingly difﬁcult.
The aim of this section is to present some general techniques that are used for
bandwidth enhancement of ampliﬁers, and this topic will be explored in more detail
when speciﬁc LNA conﬁgurations are investigated and when the state of-the-art
conﬁgurations are explored later in this book.
Lee [26] presents several ampliﬁer topologies that can be used to increase
ampliﬁer bandwidth. One of the ampliﬁer variations is the shunt peaking
common-source ampliﬁer depicted in Fig. 2.24. This topology incorporates an
inductor L at the drain of the transistor. The conﬁguration can be conﬁgured as

maximum bandwidth, maximally ﬂat frequency response, best group delay or
maximum power transfer. For maximum bandwidth, L is chosen as
L1 ¼ R2Cﬃﬃﬃ

p
ð2:60Þ
and the bandwidth of the ampliﬁer is increased by a factor of about 1.85. For
maximum ﬂatness,
ﬃﬃﬃ
2
p
can be replaced with *3.1. In this case, the bandwidth is
increased only about 1.72 times.
Perhaps the simplest conﬁguration is the conﬁguration that makes use of neg-
ative feedback. In Fig. 2.25, feedback resistor RF turns a common-source ampliﬁer
with source degeneration into a shunt-series ampliﬁer. Note that the biasing is not
shown in this ﬁgure. The name stems from the use of the combination of shunt and
series feedback. The gain of this ampliﬁer decreases to

ð2:62Þ
where gm, Cgs and Cgd are common emitter small signal gain and parasitic capac-
itances, all of which will be discussed in Chap. 3 of this book.
Another technique for increasing the bandwidth is to replace a single-ended
ampliﬁer with a differential ampliﬁer, such as the ampliﬁer shown in Fig. 2.26.
A differential ampliﬁer is already a good choice in many ampliﬁer conﬁgurations,
because of good common mode noise rejection. The increase in bandwidth can be
understood in terms of transitional frequency fT. In Chap. 3, the fT of a transistor
will be deﬁned as
fT ¼ 1

In a differential conﬁguration, the device capacitances Cgs and Cgd of each
transistor in the differential ampliﬁer appear in series. For perfectly matched
transistors,
ðCgs þ CgdÞ0 ¼ 1
2 ðCgs þ CgdÞ
ð2:64Þ
and thus
f 0
T ¼ 2fT;
ð2:65Þ
and the differential ampliﬁer is therefore an fT doubler. As a result, any ampliﬁer
built around transistors with doubled fT will have somewhat higher bandwidth.
More complex ampliﬁer topologies other than the ones described up to now are
also used. A balanced ampliﬁer implemented with 90° hybrid couplers is described
here. This is shown in Fig. 2.27 [3]. The two 90° hybrid couplers in the balanced
ampliﬁer serve to cancel out reﬂections from the ampliﬁer input ports, which leads
to an improved impedance match. Furthermore, the bandwidth of the overall
ampliﬁer system is primarily determined by the coupler bandwidth, meaning that
these can be optimized individually to increase the overall bandwidth.

Narrowband Ampliﬁer Techniques
The alternative to a broadband ampliﬁer is the narrowband ampliﬁers. Narrowband
ampliﬁers are achieved by introducing a resonant tank, which is used to pass a
frequency or a group of frequencies selectively while attenuating all other fre-
quencies [19, 22, 27]. In LNAs, the same concept can be used to resonate out the
unwanted parasitic components, e.g. an inductor can be placed in parallel or in
series to a parasitic capacitance.
A circuit diagram of a parallel resonant circuit is shown in Fig. 2.28.
The reactance of capacitor C at any frequency is
XC ¼ 1

ð2:66Þ
where x = 2pf is the angular frequency. The reactance of the inductor is

An important property of a resonant tank is that it ideally does not add any
attenuation to the signal at the frequency of resonance. This can be proven by
assuming that the combined reactance of the capacitor and inductor close to reso-
nance is sufﬁciently small to allow load resistance in parallel to be ignored. The

If Si and Ni can be deﬁned as signal and noise power respectively at the input of the

ð2:74Þ
and
No ¼ GNi:
ð2:75Þ
A non-ideal ampliﬁer will add some noise, such that
No [ GNi:
ð2:76Þ
Equation (2.74) also allows for an alternative deﬁnition of the noise factor in
terms of gain:
F ¼ No
GNi
;
ð2:77Þ
which illustrates that F is also the ratio of the total output noise to the part of output
noise due to the source resistance (ampliﬁed input noise).
2.12.2
Noise Floor
The noise power that is always present at the receiver is known as the noise ﬂoor. If
the signal is to be detected, the signal power always needs to be greater than the
noise power by at least the value of the noise ﬂoor to result in So > No and reliable
signal detection. LNAs are therefore designed with a low noise ﬁgure, allowing for
a lower minimum detectable signal (MDS). The lowest MDS of a receiver with
bandwidth B and overall noise ﬁgure NF in dB is [20]
MDS ¼ 173:83 þ NF þ 10 log B:
ð2:78Þ
The value of −173.83 dB is the noise ﬂoor at 290 K.

Noise Temperature
An alternative way to represent the noise is through noise temperature. The noise
temperature Tn is deﬁned as the temperature at which the source resistance must be
kept to so that the noise at the output due to source resistance is equal to the noise
produced by the circuit itself. At temperature T at which the noise temperature is
speciﬁed, Tn can be computed by
Tn ¼ TðF  1Þ:
ð2:79Þ
2.12.4
Noise Bandwidth
Noise bandwidth can be deﬁned more formally if a reference frequency is chosen.
The reference frequency of the noise passband is normally chosen as the band
center frequency. As a result, noise bandwidth is deﬁned as
B ¼

ð2:80Þ
where G(f) is the ampliﬁer frequency response and GO is the gain at the reference
frequency.
2.12.5
Minimum Noise Figure and Practical Ampliﬁer
Design
Although every network can be designed for a minimum noise ﬁgure Fmin by doing
noise matching, some noise matching is naturally sacriﬁced to ensure that the
required gain of the ampliﬁer is reached and that the stability criterion is satisﬁed.
This results in the concept of simultaneous noise and power matching, discussed
before. In this case, an alternative noise ﬁgure deﬁnition may be derived that
includes Fmin and the part of the noise due to noise mismatch. In that case, if the
noise is described by means of two-port conductance Gn (or alternatively, resistance
Rn = 1/Gn) and if the source has conductance Gs, the noise ﬁgure will be minimized
for some optimal source conductance Gopt. A two-port noise ampliﬁer network is
represented in Fig. 2.30.

If Gs = Gopt, then F = Fmin. At any other source admittance, the noise ﬁgure can
be calculated as
F ¼ Fmin þ Rn
Gs
ðGs  GoptÞ2:
ð2:81Þ
This equation assumes no imaginary components in the source or noise values.
A more complete formula would be in terms of admittances, i.e.
F ¼ Fmin þ Rn
Gs
jYs  Yoptj2
ð2:82Þ
where Ys is the actual source admittance and Yopt is the optimal source admittance.
For millimeter-wave designs, a representation utilizing reﬂection coefﬁcients
may be more applicable. Equation (2.81) can be rewritten as
F ¼ Fmin þ 4Rn
Z0
jCS  Coptj2
1  jCSj2

ð2:83Þ
where Copt is now the optimal source reﬂection coefﬁcient and Z0 is the charac-
teristic impedance of the ampliﬁer [28]. Copt and Yopt are related with the expression
Yopt ¼ Y0
1  Copt

ð2:84Þ
where Y0 is now the ampliﬁer characteristic admittance.
2.12.6
Input Noise Power
If the input impedance is matched for the minimum noise ﬁgure, and the noise
bandwidth is known, the input noise power to the ampliﬁer can actually be com-
puted, which simpliﬁes noise calculations. Per deﬁnition, the input taken at the

2.12.7
Noise Factor in a Cascaded System
If several ampliﬁers are cascaded, as illustrated in Fig. 2.31, each ampliﬁer will
have its own noise ﬁgure. The noise factor of the m-th ampliﬁer is thus from
Eq. (1.49)
Fm ¼ Nom
GmNi
;
ð2:87Þ
where Gm is the gain of the m-th ampliﬁer and Ni is constant, per deﬁnition, for each
ampliﬁer stage. If Eq. (2.86) is rewritten for the m-th ampliﬁer as
Nom ¼ GNi þ Nm
ð2:88Þ
where Nm is the noise added to the ampliﬁer itself, then Fm will be
Fm ¼ GmNi þ Nm

Nc ¼ ðFc  1ÞGcNi;
ð2:93Þ
and also
Nc ¼ G2N1 þ N2:

This leads to an important observation: the noise ﬁgure of the cascaded system
will be predominantly determined by the noise ﬁgure of the ﬁrst ampliﬁer stage. In
the receiver, the noise ﬁgure is thus mostly determined by the LNA, which illus-
trates the importance of the concept for the low-noise research. Similarly, if an LNA
is designed as a multistage ampliﬁer, the noise ﬁgure of the ﬁrst stage will be the
one that should be considered.
2.13
Ampliﬁer Linearity
As discussed in Chap. 1, linearity is related to LNA performance and understanding
linearity concepts aids in understanding research into LNA linearity improvements.
2.13.1
Harmonic Distortion and Intermodulation Distortion
Harmonic distortion arises owing to the unwanted multiples of the fundamental
frequency of the output signal of the particular system appearing in the signal
waveforms. If the fundamental frequency is denoted with fc, then the n-th harmonic
is designated as nfc.
2.12
Noise in Ampliﬁers

Harmonic distortion is typically quantiﬁed by means of total harmonic distortion
(THD). THD is the ratio of the sum of the power in all harmonic components to the
power contained in the fundamental frequency, expressed as [29]
THD ¼

P1

on
p
V1
;
ð2:97Þ
where Von is the root-mean square (RMS) value of the voltage of the n-th harmonic
and V1 is the RMS value of the voltage of the signal at fundamental frequency.
Similar to harmonic distortion is the IMD, where instead of multiples of one
frequency appearing at the output, intermodulation products of at least two fre-
quencies f1 and f2 appear at the output, i.e. fIMD = ± nf1 ± mf2 [19] for natural
values of m and n.
A technique called the two-tone test is used in practice, to measure the IMD. The
test is conducted such that at least two sinusoidal waveforms are applied in series to
the ampliﬁer. The test result is expressed as the carrier-to-intermodulation ratio (C/
I), which should be higher than 30 dBc (dB below carrier). If a two-tone signal
vin ¼ A cos x1t þ B cos x2t
ð2:98Þ
consisting of two signals at frequencies x1 = 2pf1 and x2 = 2pf2 spaced closely
together in the frequency domain is applied to the ampliﬁer that introduces an
amount of distortion, then the output waveform can be expressed as a Taylor
polynomial with an inﬁnite number of terms:
voutðtÞ ¼ a0 þ a1vinðtÞ þ a2v2
inðtÞ þ a3v3
inðtÞ þ . . . þ anvn
inðtÞ þ . . .;
ð2:99Þ
where a0, a1, a2, …, an,… are some ampliﬁcation coefﬁcients. Typically, only the
ﬁrst four coefﬁcients are used to evaluate so-called third-order intermodulation
distortion, or IMD3:
voutðtÞ ¼ a þ bvinðtÞ þ cv2
inðtÞ þ dv3
inðtÞ:
ð2:100Þ
Expanding Eq. (2.100) with Eq. (2.98) results in
vout ¼ a þ bðA cos x1t þ B cos x2tÞ
þ cðA2 cos2 x1t þ B2 cos2 x2t þ 2AB cos x1t cos x2tÞ
þ dðA3 cos3 x1t þ A2B cos2 x1t cos x2t
þ AB2 cos x1t cos2 x2t þ B3 cos3 x2tÞ:
ð2:101Þ
In this equation, IMD3 terms are terms that give m and n such that m + n = 3.
By deﬁnition then, the terms dA2B cos2 x1t cos x2t and dAB2 cos x1t cos2 x2t
70

Speciﬁcation-Governed Telecommunication …

represent the third-order intermodulation terms at frequencies 2x1 −x2 and
2x2 −x1, illustrated in Fig. 2.32. This computation also results in unwanted sig-
nals at other combinations of frequency sum and difference: x2 −x1, x2 + x1,
2x1, 2x2, 3x1, 3x2, 2x1 + x2, x1 + 2x2. In this case, however, these appear
much further from either x1 or x2, in the frequency domain, and can be ﬁltered out.
If power is associated to each output voltage waveform term in Eq. (2.101), then
IMD3 (in dB) can be expressed as the difference in wanted power at f2, Pout(f2) and
the unwanted power Pout(2f2 −f1) of the intermodulation term 2f2 −f1:
IMD3 ¼ Poutðf2Þ  Poutð2f2  f1Þ;
ð2:102Þ
where power quantities are expressed in dBm.
2.13.2
Gain Compression
The power gain equation Eq. (2.26), introduced in Chap. 1, indicates a linear
relationship between the output power and input power of an ampliﬁer. In reality,
this linear relationship only holds for a narrow range and typically, as the amount of
input power increases, at a certain stage the output power will stop tracking the
input power, i.e. gain value will decrease, or rather, compress. Gain compression is
typically speciﬁed in terms of the 1 dB compression point, deﬁned as the input
power level at which the output power has dropped to 1 dB below the linear
characteristic [8]. This effect is illustrated in Fig. 2.33, where both the x and y axes
are in dBm.
The 1 dB compression point relationship can formally be expressed as
OP1dB ¼ IP1dB þ G  1 dB,
ð2:103Þ
where OP1dB is the output power at 1 dB compression point and IP1dB is the input
power at 1 dB compression point, and all parameters are expressed in either dB or
dBm, as in the ﬁgure.

2.13.3
Third Order Intercept Point
The third order intercept point is a linearity measure that ties with both gain
compression and intermodulation distortion.
With intermodulation distortion present, it is clear that in a non-ideal ampliﬁer,
the power will also be generating terms of the third order (cubed terms). Thus,
assuming that all the other terms are attenuated by a ﬁlter, the wanted power Pout(f2)
and the unwanted power Pout(2f2 −f1) deﬁned previously can be plotted on the
same set of axes against the input power Pin(f2), as illustrated in Fig. 2.34, with both
axes once more in dBm.
From Eq. (2.26) the slope of the Pout(f2) versus Pin(f2) curve on the dBm scale
will have a value of 1. Since the curve for Pout(2f2 −f1) versus Pin(f2) contains
Pin (dBm)

third-order terms, and log(x3) = 3logx, the slope of the curve on the dB scale will
have a value of 3, as shown in Fig. 2.34. At low signal levels, the third-order
products are negligibly small, meaning that for low Pin, Pin(f2) > Pout(2f2 −f1). As
the input power increases, the slope of the Pout(2f2 −f1) versus Pin(f2) curve will
cause it to come closer and closer to the Pout(2f2) versus Pin(f2) curve until the two
curves eventually intercept. The intersection of these two curves will mark the
third-order intercept point (IP3). Another intercept point can be derived for f1 and
2f1 −f2 curves.
In practical ampliﬁers, because of gain compression (which is typically lower by
about 10 to 15 dB than IP3), this point will remain hypothetical; however, it still
makes for a useful linearity metric. Depending on whether the value of the IP3 is
read on the x or the y axis of the graph illustrating the concept, both output (OIP3)
and input (IIP3) third-order intercept points can be deﬁned.
Unlike the noise factor, the IIP3 gets better as the frequency increases. Also, the
IIP3 of the last stage of a multi-stage system dominates the overall IIP3 of the
system.
2.13.4
Ampliﬁer Dynamic Range
The ampliﬁer dynamic range is another measure of linearity and is generally
deﬁned as the operating range over which a particular component exhibits desirable
performance. It typically refers to the linear portion of the power ampliﬁcation
curve, that is, the top limit is taken as the point at which the intermodulation
distortion becomes intolerable. In an LNA, often operating close to the noise ﬂoor,
its lower limit can be established by the noise. This leads to the deﬁnition of the
spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR), which is the range for which the spurious
responses are minimal. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.35.
The SFDR, df, in terms of output third-order intercept point OP3 and noise No

Performance Measure of a Low-Noise Ampliﬁer
Instead of looking at the parameters such as noise ﬁgure, gain and bandwidth of an
LNA separately, the overall performance of an LNA can be assessed by a single
ﬁgure of merit (FOM) [30]. The LNA ﬁgure of merit can be expressed in terms of
the GBP, the magnitude of the noise factor Fmag and the DC power consumption
Pdc. Thus,
FOM ¼

Concluding Remarks
This chapter served as a ﬁrst step in contextualizing the research into LNAs for
millimeter-wave applications covered in this book. It covered several important
aspects that need to be considered in the design of an LNA, such as the band in
which the LNA is to operate and therefore the design frequency of operation and

signal wavelength. The wavelength in turn inﬂuences the antenna design and also
the propagation characteristics of the signal. All of these inﬂuence the quality of the
signal reaching the LNA. The modulation scheme deployed at the transmitter also
determines the type of signals that will reach the LNA and thus the types of
modulation schemes were also discussed to place the research in the telecommu-
nication context.
To simplify the connection of the subsystems, such as the antenna to the LNA or
LNA to the demodulator, two-port modeling is often used. Thus, in this chapter,
two-port modeling was discussed and LNA design parameters, such as gain and the
noise ﬁgure, were discussed once again from the two-port perspective. Design
speciﬁcations also govern parameters describing the linearity of LNA, and the ﬁnal
portion of this chapter was dedicated to linearity and distortion.
In addition to the speciﬁcations posed by the application, some of the LNA
research is initiated by the active device technology that is available to the
researcher. Understanding fabrication technologies is therefore of crucial impor-
tance for research into LNAs. This is discussed in Chap. 3.

Chapter 3
Technologies for Low-Noise Ampliﬁers
in the Millimeter-Wave Regime
Abstract This chapter expands the research contextualization elaborated in pre-
vious chapters, towards the millimeter-wave device technologies. It is divided into
two parts. The ﬁrst part conducts research into solid-state device technologies that
meet the requirements for millimeter-wave LNA applications, namely HEMT,
CMOS/BiCMOS and HBT devices. The second part focuses on transistor modeling
in different technologies: even though this might appear to be a separate topic,
modeling is closely related to transistor technology.
In Chaps. 1 and 2, the millimeter-wave regime was discussed in some detail and it
was established that this regime offers a wide variety of opportunities in numerous
different industries, including wireless communication, automotive radar, imaging,
gesture recognition and radio astronomy. This frequency range not only provides a
whole new world of opportunity, but also includes multiple unlicensed ranges that
draw researchers to it. However, design in the millimeter-wave range is only
possible if there are technologies that that are able to support the visions researchers
and designers are pursuing. Therefore, this chapter is going to expand Part I of this
book,
the
research
contextualization,
towards
the
millimeter-wave
device
technologies.
Once more, the chapter will be divided into two parts. The ﬁrst part of this
chapter will conduct research into solid-state device technologies that meet the
requirements
for
millimeter-wave
LNA
applications,
namely
HEMT,
CMOS/BiCMOS and HBT devices. All three technologies have shown excellent
results in millimeter-wave LNA publications, and some technologies have shown
the ability to support even sub-terahertz operation, as discussed before. Each device
technology comes with its own beneﬁts and drawbacks. In addition, it is crucial for
active devices to note the restrictions that accompany the passive circuit elements,
and for example, packaging. Special attention must always be paid to the overall
estate requirements of passive requirements and considerations of passives will be
postponed until Chap. 4. Discrete fabrication technologies (substrates) and pack-
aging processes (for example, SoP) will, however, also be considered here.

The second part of the chapter will focus on transistor modeling in different
technologies. Even though this might appear to be a separate topic, modeling is
closely related to transistor technology. Speciﬁcally for LNAs, where noisy small
signals are to be ampliﬁed, the topics will include the high-frequency small-signal
models of transistors, as applicable to millimeter-waves, as well as transistor noise
modeling.
3.1
Transistor Technologies
The transistor forms the core of each ampliﬁer and the technology used can have a
signiﬁcant impact on its performance. Several device technologies have tradition-
ally been used for fabricating transistors that can be used at RF and above [1–3].
Initial efforts at RF ampliﬁcation were made in gated structures such as MOSFETs
(forming part of CMOS technologies), metal-semiconductor ﬁeld-effect transistors
(MESFETs), HEMTs, pseudomorphic HEMTs (pHEMTs) and metamorphic
HEMTs (mHEMTs). This changed after the introduction of the HBT, a bipolar
transistor with a wide-gap emitter. An HBT offers higher gain and current densities
as frequencies increase. Nowadays, the most commonly used transistor technolo-
gies for regimes from RF up to millimeter-wave applications are HEMT, CMOS

BiCMOS processes are emerging as an alternative to either pure HBT tech-
nologies or pure CMOS technologies. In BiCMOS, it is possible to fabricate both
MOSFETs and HBTs in the same process, thus allowing both baseband and RF
circuitry to be placed on the same IC, thereby removing the integration gap that
would otherwise appear during transmitter or receiver deployment, although, as will
be seen in the section that follows, this is becoming increasingly possible with
CMOS or HEMT technologies.
3.1.1
Figures of Merit
As new technologies emerge, they are typically compared with existing technolo-
gies in order to establish whether they are acceptable for a particular application.
One way of comparing technologies is to introduce various ﬁgures of merit [5].
Several ﬁgures of merit are widely used. For example, the Johnson’s ﬁgure of merit
is calculated as
JFOM ¼ EBDvsat

ð3:1Þ
and Baliga’s ﬁgure of merit is deﬁned as

where e0 (8.85  10−12 F/m) is the absolute permittivity, and the rest of the
parameters are properties of each technology deﬁned as follows: EG is the bandgap
energy, ln is the electron mobility (for the sake of completion lp is the hole
mobility), EBD is the breakdown electric ﬁeld, vsat is saturation electron drift

velocity and er is the relative dielectric of the substrate. Most of these parameters
will be deﬁned more strictly later in this chapter when modeling of transistors is
investigated.
In addition to the ﬁgures of merit, and the parameters that are used for their
computation, which themselves can serve as a means of comparison of technolo-
gies, other means of comparison are possible. Another means of comparison of the
technology, especially as the frequency increases, is with regard to fT, the transistor
transitional frequency that will be formally deﬁned for MOSFETs and bipolar
transistors later in this chapter. The general rule of the thumb with regard to the
required fT for wideband ampliﬁers (therefore, LNAs) is that it needs to be at least
three times more than the maximum frequency of the operation of the ampliﬁer. For
60 GHz operation in the unlicensed band, fT’s of at least 180 are then required. For
narrowband ampliﬁers, gain ﬂatness is not as important as in the case of wideband
ampliﬁers, so operation close to fT has been achieved in the past (e.g. a 245 GHz in
a technology with fT of 300 GHz [6]) Sometimes, technology researchers use the
maximum frequency of oscillation, fMAX, as a technology metric. Frequency fMAX,
which is generally higher than fT, will also be deﬁned later in this chapter.
3.1.2
CMOS
CMOS is well known for its use in digital logic circuits, such as microcontrollers
and memory circuits. Digital application of CMOS has allowed for initial wide-
spread use of these devices and aided in the aggressive progression of the tech-
nology. While CMOS is widely used in digital circuits, its applicability in analog,
RF, and thus millimeter-wave applications should not be ignored. Some of the main
advantages of CMOS technology, even with millimeter-wave applications, are the
relatively low cost and the fact that a high level of integration can be achieved [7].
The silicon substrate of the CMOS technology has excellent thermal qualities and
high resistance to mechanical stress; it is suitable for controllable doping with
n-type and p-type impurities. CMOS also offers simple integration steps, good
scaling capability and good reliability. Because of this CMOS, together with
BiCMOS, is generally considered the least expensive transistor technology cur-
rently available. Recent improvements to CMOS have allowed MOSFETs to
achieve noise performance comparable to that of HEMTs [8].
Some of the main characteristics of CMOS technology are the low supply
voltages and low breakdown voltages. Low-voltage operation allows for lower
power consumption, which is another advantage of CMOS. However, CMOS
technology is susceptible to circuit losses due to the low substrate resistance of
silicon. As will be seen a little later, BiCMOS technology can, for example, be
implemented with SiGe, which reduces the circuit losses in CMOS by using a
higher resistivity wafer for the BiCMOS process.

The symbol and the structure of a typical MOSFET are shown in Fig. 3.3.
The MOSFET is fabricated by using highly doped drain and source regions sep-
arated by a channel region. For an n-channel MOSFET (nMOS) transistor, the drain
and source the doping are done using n-type material in a p-substrate, while for the
p-channel MOSFET (pMOS) transistor, source and drain are created by implanting
the p-type material in a well built from n-type material (n-well). Gate material is
grown over a thin insulating layer (typically silicon-dioxide, referred to simply as
the oxide) on top of the channel. Traditionally, the gate was built from aluminum,
but various research efforts have produced MOSFETs with gates built from dif-
ferent materials (for example, polysilicon or poly, for short). Two basic parameters
of every MOSFET are its channel length, L, and its doping region (source or drain)
width, W, also shown in Fig. 3.3. The technology scaling then normally refers to
the minimum attainable transistor length.
3.1.2.1
State-of-the-Art CMOS Technologies for Millimeter-Waves
Numerous CMOS technologies have been reported to date that are more than
capable of handling the intricate challenges associated with millimeter-wave
applications [9–11]. A 45-nm IBM process is an excellent example of a process that
is widely used in millimeter-wave applications. It offers CMOS devices with a high
claimed fT and fMAX exceeding 400 GHz, which is sufﬁcient for operation up to over
100 GHz.

3.1.3
High-Electron Mobility Transistor Technology
HEMTs are essentially FETs that use a heterostructure formed through two semi-
conductor materials with differing bandgaps [12]. As a result, higher electron
mobility is achieved. A method known as selective doping is used to exploit the
different bandgaps between semiconductor materials, resulting in a bandgap
potential responsible for the improved mobility. In a typical III–V material-based
HEMT, multiple layers of III–V semiconductor material are stacked vertically.
HEMT technology is often preferred in millimeter-wave applications and is
regarded as the best performing technology regarding the noise ﬁgure, which is
extremely beneﬁcial for LNA design. Simultaneously, LNAs built around HEMT
devices can achieve high gains [13]. HEMT transistors built in indium-phosphate
(InP) use one of the fastest HEMT materials that is able to provide power gain at
frequencies exceeding 1 THz [14, 15], but this technology is expensive and fragile.
Furthermore, InP HEMT transistors have the lowest noise temperature, which
allows
for
low-noise
implementations
at
cryogenic
temperatures
[16].
Gallium-arsenide (GaAs) is more robust and affordable [14], but is also costly and
HEMT transistors suffer from low integration capabilities. GaN-based HEMT
devices are generally preferred for high frequency and high power applications
[17]. Other typical materials used in HEMT processes are GaAs/AlxGa1–xAs,
InGaAs/InAlAs and InAs/AlSb materials.
If the GaAs is combined with other materials through pseudomorphic or meta-
morphic methods, then pHEMTs and mHEMTs are created.
3.1.3.1
State-of-the-Art High-Electron Mobility Technologies
for Millimeter-Waves
As seen in the discussion above, a number of HEMT technologies capable of
reaching millimeter-wave operation have been reported recently. For example,
pHEMT devices capable of fT = 644 GHz have been reported by Kim and del
Alamo in [18] and Deal et al. reported low-noise ampliﬁcation in the pHEMT
process with fMAX = 1.5 GHz [15].
3.1.4
Heterojunction Bipolar Transistor Technology
Similar to HEMT devices, HBT devices consist of heterostructures of compound
semi-conductors, which are arranged to provide optimum electron traveling speeds
between layers. However, in case of HBTs, the transistor is in essence a BJT and
not a MOSFET. SiGe HBTs were initially intended for use in high-speed digital
applications.

The main difference between the SiGe HBT and silicon-based BJT is that the
base region of the HBT is lightly doped with germanium. By deﬁnition then, the
pn-junction of the BJT becomes a heterojunction (as opposed to homojunction in
regular silicon transistors), hence the name of the device. The heterojunction
formed from the process leads to signiﬁcant current gains in the device, most
notably from the emitter-base junction of the device [19]. In LNAs, high current
gain implies that in feedback conﬁgurations mentioned in Chap. 1, resistive feed-
back may be used to achieve wideband matching without severely degrading the
noise ﬁgure. HBTs also suffer less from ﬂicker noise, described later in this chapter.
Germanium doping of silicon-based devices does not require many processing
changes from the standard CMOS process steps, which allows for all the devices
available in a typical CMOS process to remain unchanged, with the advantage of
the added BJT. This leads to one of the main advantages of SiGe technology: its
ability to integrate analog, RF and digital circuitry on a single chip while retaining
low power capabilities, high density and low cost of CMOS technologies. With
many HBT technologies being able to cross the fT > 200 GHz mark, SiGe has
become very well suited for millimeter-wave applications as well [4, 14]. The
symbol and the cross-section of the typical npn bipolar transistor are shown in
Fig. 3.4, where the collector and the emitter are built from the n-type material and
the base is built from the p-type material (the “negative” counterpart to the npn is
the pnp bipolar transistor).
In addition to SiGe HBTs, heterojunction can be built from other materials as
well. For example, recent reports have shown that InP HBT devices are capable of
achieving cut-off frequencies in the 1 THz range [20]. Some other III-V HBTs have
also been explored and they will be discussed later in a separate section.

Research into HBTs over the past decade has resulted in some very high-fT devices.
For example, a SiGe HBT achieved with fT = 320 GHz and fMAX = 370 GHz at
room temperature was demonstrated in [21]. The true potential of HBT is, however,
unlocked at cryogenic temperatures because much higher cutoff frequencies can be
reached [16]. For example the fT = 710 GHz and fMAX = 618 GHz were reached at
4.3 K [22].
3.1.5
Other Technologies
Technologies such as gallium-nitride (GaN), aluminum-gallium-nitride (AlGaN),
silicon-carbide (SiC), and InP have been struggling for survival in the battle
between Si, SiGe and GaAs technologies [1, 23–29]. The AlGaN/GaN is suitable
for both high-frequency and high-power designs, but together with the SiC tech-
nology it has been sidetracked on the road to microwave and millimeter-wave
applications by technical difﬁculties and high fabrication costs.
3.1.6
Comparative Analysis
Roodaki et al. [4] presented a comparative analysis of transistor technologies by
comparing the most important parameters as applicable for millimeter-wave
applications. This is presented in Table 3.1. Most of the aspects evident from the
table have already been discussed throughout this chapter: that is, well performing
technologies come at an increased cost. This table once more points out the
superiority of the SiGe technology.

With SiGe technology standing out, one could compare other technologies
through different means. Another way of comparison would be to compare, for
example, only technologies built with one transistor type. Thus, Table 3.2 shows
some typical parameters for some Si, SiC, GaN and GaAs BJT/HBT processes,
allowing for more formal comparison by means of the ﬁgures of merit discussed
earlier, which are recorded in the last two rows of the same table.
3.2
Substrates for Discrete Implementations and Silicon
on Package
In integrated designs, substrate refers to a material on which the transistors and
other components are deposited, such as Si described in the previous section. For
the design of discrete components, it is important to mention substrates for discrete
implementations. When referring to substrates in discrete implementations, one
could be referring to substrates on which discrete components or transmission lines
are fabricated (e.g. inductors, capacitors, resistors—topic of Chap. 4), substrates for
PCBs on which the transmission lines are designed, and substrates for packaged
systems and subsystems (SoP) [30–32].
SoP allows for the substrate to provide excellent high-frequency electrical
properties, perhaps better than those of the integrated solution. SoP substrates
should also have good mechanical and chemical resistance and thin-ﬁlm multilayer
capabilities, however, while remaining cost-competitive. Ceramic and organic
substrates can generally all satisfy these requirements [31, 32]. Typical ceramic
substrates used are low-temperature co-ﬁred ceramics and high-temperature co-ﬁred
ceramics. The organic substrate includes various polymers, including liquid-crystal
polymers.

In the case of discrete components, substrates are chosen so that they exhibit
very little parasitic resistance or reactance. Thin-ﬁlm resistors, for example, are
typically produced on alumina or beryllia substrates because they entail a small
amount of reactance. Thin ﬁlm processes also allow for fabrication of other pas-
sives, and a wide variety of RF passive components, such as couplers, power
dividers, microstrip lines, antennas and ﬁlters [33].
The PCB for discrete implementations, which is normally used to support
connections of the electronic components mechanically, could also feature sub-
strates that are non-conductive. Different types of ceramic materials, such as
high-temperature co-ﬁred alumina or aluminum-nitride with better thermal prop-
erties, are available. Glasses are also extensively used. Hybrid structures, such as
laminates that are made of bonded layers, normally with a FR4 or Duroid® material
core, may be needed to meet stringent RF requirements. FR4 consists of
epoxy-resin strengthened with an embedded woven fabric of glass ﬁbers [34], but
has some disadvantages at millimeter-wave frequencies, such as thermal expansion
and signiﬁcant variation of the dielectric constant with temperature. Duroid®, on the
other hand, is a composite laminate that has better properties for millimeter-wave
applications.
Table 3.3 shows a comparison of advantages and disadvantages between using
IC substrates, PCB substrates and SoP substrates at millimeter-wave. Additional
advantages of SoP will be discussed later in Chap. 8.
3.3
Transistor Modeling for Small-Signal Operation
As the frequency increases, proper transistor modelling becomes increasingly
important. For simulation purposes, transistor models for a particular technology
are typically made available through a process design kit provided by the foundry
(that is, the company that offers the services of semiconductor processing).
Traditionally, for BJTs, the Gummel-Poon model was the most popular model for
the design of bipolar circuits for a considerable time [35]. For RF, models such as

the Vertical Bipolar Inter-Company (known as VBIC) model for the HBT have to
be used [36], as they offer several improvements over the Gummel-Poon model.
Over the last decade, considerable efforts have been made to improve the models,
which were mostly driven by the quest for increased frequencies of operation. One
of those efforts was to develop the high-current (HiCum) transistor model of the
HBT [37]. Some of the main advantages of this model are the ability to accurately
predict the high-current operation of devices (for example for high-power ampli-
ﬁers, e.g. the power ampliﬁer), band-gap differences and geometry scalability.
For hand analysis, however, much more simpliﬁed transistor models are used.
While for some applications, the transistor can even be modeled as a simple
resistive switch, for LNAs it is important to consider the compete small-signal
high-frequency model. In this model, the noise of the transistor is typically omitted,
so it is usually considered separately. A typical LNA is required to amplify
extremely weak signals, so the small-signal model is deemed applicable, unlike for
some other ampliﬁers (most prominently, power ampliﬁers). Therefore, in this
chapter small-signal models and noise models of MOSFETs (or HEMTs) as well as
BJTs (or HBTs) will be considered, starting with the MOSFET.
3.3.1
MOSFET Modeling
The basic principle of operation of MOSFETs can be understood by looking at their
structure, and applying different voltage levels [38–42]. Normally, the analysis
begins by grounding the source terminal of an nMOS transistor and varying the
voltage of the drain terminal (VDS) and gate terminals (VGS) with respect to
the grounded source. The fourth terminal of an nMOS, the body, connects through
the substrate to the ground anyway; as a matter of fact, further discussion in this
section will assume that body effect does not appear, that is, that source and body
are shorted together (this happens under two conditions: the source is grounded, or
an isolated nMOS is used—that is, a layout technique is used to introduce a large
resistance drop from the body of the transistor and the rest of the substrate). As VDS
and VGS increase, horizontal and vertical electric ﬁelds are generated respectively,
the effect that resulted in the name given to this type of transistor. For different
values of VDS and VGS three regions of operation can be identiﬁed experimentally
(with −VGD = VDS −VGS):
• Cutoff, where VGS, VGD < Vt, the transistor threshold voltage, which is the
technology-determined property (predominantly dependent on the material
doping and temperature of operation);
• Saturation or pinch-off (active) region, where VGS  Vt and VGD < Vt or
VGS < Vt and VGD  Vt; and
• Triode, where VGS, VGD  Vt.
3.3
Transistor Modeling for Small-Signal Operation
87

In the cutoff region, the voltage VGS is not enough for the channel between the drain
and source to form and current ID to start ﬂowing; thus the voltage at which this current
starts to ﬂow is the threshold voltage mentioned above. In the active region, the
channel has formed (the pinch-off has occurred), and the transistor conducts fully (the
drain current is at its maximum). In the middle, triode region, the channel exhibits
resistive behavior. The MOSFET regions of operation can be understood somewhat
better by analyzing the ID versus VDS curve for different values of VGS, as illustrated in
Fig. 3.5. Note that the transistor in all regions of operation needs to be operated such
that breakdown of various pn-junctions is avoided.
Transistor ampliﬁers are usually biased so that the transistor operates in the
active region (VGS  Vt). Therefore, in the active region, the current ID of a long
device (device with a length greater than roughly 1 lm) can be computed using the
following formula:
ID ¼ k0

where W and L have already been introduced, k is the channel-length modulation
parameter, which will be deﬁned later (not to be confused with the wavelength) and
k’ is the parameter deﬁned as

tox
;
ð3:4Þ
where Cox, eox and tox are the capacitance, permittivity and thickness of the gate
oxide respectively and l is the mobility of the majority carriers (that is the carriers
in the drain or the source, either ln or lp). The difference term VGS −Vt appears in
MOSFET equations frequently; for simplicity, this potential difference is normally
referred to as the voltage overdrive (Vov), or the additional voltage to the minimum
voltage required for the transistor to operate in the active region.
Equation (3.3) also predicts dependence on VDS. This dependence is due to the
fact that with an increase in VDS, the physical pinch-off point and the point where
channel and drain meet are separated by an increasing distance Xd. This causes the

effective length of the channel to decrease by a small amount; that is, the effective
length becomes Leff = L −Xd. The amount of change (modulation) is once again
technology-dependent and to simplify computations, the channel-length modulation
parameter was deﬁned as
k ¼ 1
Leff
dXd

;
ð3:5Þ
with units of V−1. Sometimes, the channel-length modulation is replaced by its
inverse parameter for simplicity, called Early voltage, VA = 1/k, expressed in volts.
With the current deﬁned in Eq. (3.3), it is fairly easy to investigate what happens
if there are small changes in the gate-source voltage, VGS, that is, DVGS = vgs if the
transistor is operating in the saturation or the active region. This further allows for
generation of a small-signal model, such as the one shown in Fig. 3.6, where the
transistor is connected in a common-source conﬁguration and the body effect is
ignored (other possible conﬁgurations being the common-gate and common-drain).
The capacitors in this model are simply the parasitic capacitors between different
device terminals. Furthermore, looking at the abovementioned drain current equa-
tion, given small changes in gate-source voltage, the current ID will also change
with a small amount (id), which introduces a dependent current source in the model,
where gm is the transconductance relating vgs and id. The output resistance ro is due
to the channel length modulation, which introduces the ohmic change in the current.
The transconductance gain, gm, is then by deﬁnition the gain parameter of the
transistor applicable to small-signal levels only, which is typically the condition of
the signals arriving at the input of an LNA. It is deﬁned as the derivative of the
drain current with respect to gate-to-source voltage, at the point where the transistor
is biased (VGS). Thus,

CMOS technologies that were considered earlier in this chapter for the mil-
limeter wave operation all allow for devices with a sub-micron channel length. It
was noted earlier that Eq. (3.3) is only valid for L  1 lm. Therefore, an alter-
native equation is required to describe the so-called short-channel effects. To avoid
the short-channel effects that will be described shortly, even in sub-micron tech-
nology, nothing prohibits one from using the transistors with the larger length; of
course, if various constraints, such as the transistor count, the available area and
operational frequency, allow for it (the latter will be discussed later).
In a short channel, the channel carriers reach velocity saturation. This is because
the electrical ﬁeld over the channel increases as the spacing between the drain and
the source decreases. With small values of L, the electric ﬁeld is sufﬁcient to ensure
that

carrier velocity is

Two things can be noted immediately from this equation. First, the drain current
is not dependent on the channel length anymore. Second, the current changes only
with the ﬁrst power of the overdrive voltage, and not with the square; that is, the
current follows the linear law instead of the quadratic law. The relationship between
the square law and the linear one is illustrated in Fig. 3.7. The actual short-channel
devices, namely the devices where the carrier velocity is not fully saturated, will
have the current that follows the curve, which is somewhere between the linear and
the square law curve.
For the completely saturated transistor, the transconductance also changes and
assumes the value of

Parasitic
capacitors
in

model
are
important
for
the
high-frequency operation of the transistor. They are inherent properties of each
technology and as such their value is mostly ﬁxed for a particular technology, with
the exception that their values sometimes change with the region of operation.
Perhaps the best-known parasitic capacitor is Cgs, which is the capacitance between
the gate and the source, which appears because of the gate oxide. It is dependent on
Cox and in the active (saturation) region of the transistor it is:
Cgs ¼ 2
3 CoxWL:
ð3:10Þ
In fact, the physical design of the transistor dictates that the parasitic Cgd is the
same as Cgs, because the drain and the source are fabricated in the same way.
However, in the active region, pinch-off occurs and the gate is separated from the
source, resulting in
Cgd ﬃ0:
ð3:11Þ
In the triode region, however, both capacitors above are equal to a half of
CoxWL, and if the transistor is in cutoff, both capacitors are equal to zero (although a
capacitor of the value CoxWL now appears between the gate and the body, Cgb).
The capacitances between the source and body and the drain and the body are
due to the source-body and drain-body pn-junctions being reverse-biased, thus:

respectively, VSB and VDB are voltages over the two pn-junctions and w0 is the
junction built-in potential in both cases, and both equations stem from the funda-
mental pn-junction equation discussed in literature. In the small-signal model of
Fig. 3.6, with the source and body shorted, Csb = 0 and Cdb appears as Cds.
The discussion on parasitic capacitors leads to perhaps the most important
parameter of any transistor technology; that is, the concept of the transitional fre-
quency fT, which has been used up to now without the mathematical deﬁnition.
Ignoring any parasitics other than Cgs and Cgd, the current through the gate at high
frequencies can be expressed as

. Of course, at a lower
frequency, there is no current ﬂowing. The current gain at high frequencies is then
the ratio of the input and output of the current:

Frequency fT is the frequency at which the magnitude of the short-circuit gain (|A
(jx)|) reaches a ratio value of 1 or 0 dB (thus marking the point where the transistor
starts acting as an attenuator instead of an ampliﬁer). Taking the magnitude of the
previous equation and setting it equal to 1, fT can be evaluated from

By substituting the equations for gm and Cgs, it is easily shown that fT is pro-
portional to the inverse of the length squared, for long channel devices:
fT /

2pL2 Vov:
ð3:19Þ
For short channel devices, recall that gm is independent for the gate length,
meaning that one multiple of the channel length L is not going to be present in
Eq. (3.19), leaving only one instance. In fact,
fT / vscl
L :
ð3:20Þ
An important consequence of this is that in sub-micron technologies, the scaling
of the length of the transistor by a factor of two only doubles the maximum
attainable fT, whereas in the past, initial scaling of technology allowed quadruple
improvement in fT. Also note that the fT is the property of transistor sizing and
biasing, meaning that the claimed fT of the technology can typically only be reached
for speciﬁc transistor size and bias, and suboptimal designs could suffer from low fT
values.
The second technology parameter that is often reported in technology research
papers is the maximum oscillation frequency fMAX. It is deﬁned as the frequency at
which the power delivered to the load of the ampliﬁer is equal to the power at the
input of the ampliﬁer (or PL/Pin = 1). The derivation of fMAX is somewhat more
involved than the derivation of fT and it will not be repeated here, but Lee [39] has
shown that

3.3.2
Bipolar Modeling
Modeling of a bipolar transistor can be done by noting that two pn-junctions are
created, one between the base and emitter, and the other one between the base and
the collector. Thus, there will be two depletion regions. Unlike the MOSFET
device, the bipolar transistor is truly a three-terminal device. Another difference
between the MOSFET and a bipolar transistor is that in the bipolar transistor, a
small amount of current is ﬂowing into the base of the transistor, whereas in the
case of the MOSFET, there is no current ﬂowing into the gate at DC. Another
3.3
Transistor Modeling for Small-Signal Operation
93

difference resulting from this property is that the bipolar transistor has a ﬁnite
current gain, which is denoted by b.
Like a MOSFET, which is usually analyzed if connected in the common-source
conﬁguration, an npn bipolar transistor is analyzed similarly in the common-emitter
conﬁguration. To determine the regions of operation of transistors, two voltages are
important: the base-emitter voltage VBE and the base-collector voltage VBC. If VBE is
lower than some voltage VBE(on) and VBC is lower than some voltage VBC(on), the
transistor will be in cut-off, similar to the cutoff of a MOSFET. VBE(on) is a property
that stems from the doping and the layout of the base-emitter-junction (the junction
built-on
potential),
and
VBC(on)
is
similarly
the
built-in
potential
of
the
base-collector junction. Three more regions of operation exist:
• Forward active region, where VBE  VBE(on) and VBC < VBC(on);
• Reverse active region, where VBE < VBE(on) and VBC  VBC(on); and
• Saturation region, where VBE  VBE(on) and VBC  VBC(on).
Relationship Vx  Vx(on) indicates that a junction is forward biased and Vx < Vx
(on) indicates reverse biasing. The bipolar transistor is meant to operate in the active
region, where the current gain is highest, and denoted by bF, where index “F”
stands for forward. If the collector and emitter are swapped, then the transistor will
attempt operating in the reverse active region, with reverse (“R”) current gain bR,
which is a few orders of magnitude smaller than bF. This behavior is intentional,
because the doping of the p-type and n-type regions is performed to maximize the
forward gain, although it is sometimes beneﬁcial to operate transistors in the reverse
active region, such as in radiation-hardened LNAs [43]. Note that the amount of
forward (and reverse) current gain is dependent on the operating conditions, tem-
perature and collector current. Furthermore, the breakdown of the various junctions
needs to be avoided for the bipolar transistor as well for all regions of operation.
Large signal behavior of the bipolar transistor is governed by three equations.
The ﬁrst equation shows that the collector current is dependent on the voltage
applied over the base-emitter junction, VBE, and the voltage between the collector
and emitter, VCE:
IC ¼ IS 1 þ VCE
VA


exp VBE
VT
;
ð3:22Þ
where IS is the transistor saturation current, which is a property of doping and the
layout and is typically in a range from 10−14 to 10−16, VT = kT/q is the thermal
voltage (approximately 26 mV at room temperature) and VA is the Early voltage.
The thermal voltage was calculated from Boltzmann’s constant k (1.38  10−23 J/
K), electron charge q (1.6  10−19 °C) and absolute temperature of operation T (in
Kelvin). The Early voltage concept is the same as the Early voltage concept deﬁned
for MOSFETs, but the origin of the effect is different. In the case of the bipolar
transistor, this happens because the effective base width changes with the applied
voltage VCE. The Early effect is normally plotted as illustrated in Fig. 3.9.

The second equation shows that current IB and IC are related by the forward
current gain, bF:
IC ¼ bFIB:
ð3:23Þ
Lastly, the emitter will “emit” the “collected” current in addition to the base
current:
IE ¼ IB þ IC ¼ IB þ bFIB ¼ bF þ 1

ÞIB:

With the large-signal operation described above, a high-frequency small-signal
model can be created for a bipolar transistor, similar to that of the MOSFET.
A circuit diagram of the small-signal model is depicted in Fig. 3.10.
Transconductance gm in this case represents the change of the collector current
due to the change of the base-emitter voltage (ic/vbe) and can be evaluated as:

Note that this equation shows that one is presented with limited control of the
transconductance value other than the choice of value of IC, unlike in the case of
MOSFET, where the length and the width of the transistor can be chosen to boost
the gain.
The small-signal diagram of the bipolar transistor also has input resistance unlike
that of the MOSFET. This is because the current IB ﬂows into the base. For
small-signal changes, the input resistance will be the ratio of the input voltage to the
base current, that is
rp ¼ vbe

where bF, the large-signal forward current gain, was replaced with b0, the
small-signal current gain.
The output resistance is once again due to the Early voltage effect:

IC
:
ð3:27Þ
Another effect is closely related to the Early voltage effect and is manifested by
the decrease of the base current due to the increase in VCE. The minimum value of
the resistor that appears between the base and the collector is b0 times greater than
the value of output resistance ro. Thus,
rl ¼ b0ro:
ð3:28Þ
Capacitors in the high-frequency small-signal model are once again important, if
for no other reason than to determine fT and fMAX. Capacitor Cp that appears in
parallel to the resistance rp is present partly because of the base-charging capaci-
tance and partly because of the emitter-base depletion layer capacitance:
Cp ¼ Cb þ Cje:
ð3:29Þ
The base-charging capacitance for the particular bias point is the product of the
base transit time in the forward direction and the transconductance:
Cb ¼ sFgm:
ð3:30Þ
The base transit time is typically in the order of tens to hundreds of picoseconds.
The base-emitter junction is forward-biased, meaning that the junction capacitance
derivation is too complex to be handled by hand and the approximation that
Cje = 2Cje0, where Cje0 is the junction capacitance with no potential applied, is
typically used.
96

capacitance, Ccs, are both normally also approximated with the reverse-biased

where Cl0 and Ccs0 represent the initial capacitance values, VCB and VCS are

pn-junctions respectively.
Using an analogy between MOSFETs and the bipolar transistor, the transitional
frequency fT can be deduced as
fT ¼
gm
2pðCp þ ClÞ :
ð3:33Þ
This equation was derived for MOSFETs using the high-frequency forward
current gain, which is inﬁnite at DC. In the bipolar case, the current gain is ﬁnite,
and the capacitors introduce a pole in the frequency response of the gain:
bðjf Þ ¼
gm
j2pf ðCp þ ClÞ :
ð3:34Þ
This is illustrated in Fig. 3.11. The frequency location of the pole is then clearly
a function of fT and is computed as
fb ¼ fT
b0
:
ð3:35Þ
where b0 is the low-frequency current gain. This once more illustrates the impor-
tance of having the high-fT technology available for millimeter-wave applications.
An interesting approximation of fT can be done if it is assumed that the sum of
Cp = Cb + Cje and Cl is dominated by the capacitance Cb. In this case,
fT ¼
1
2psF
;
ð3:36Þ
which indicates strong dependence of the transitional frequency on the base-charging
time. It can be noted, for example, that SiGe HBT technologies can improve the value
of sF in comparison to pure silicon technologies (as a matter offact, the quantity named
3.3

transit time, sT, is improved, where sT = sF + Cje/gm + Cl/gm), which is one of the
main reasons why the SiGe technologies have become so popular in recent years.

width.
3.4
Transistor Modeling for Noise
Although the concept of noise was introduced as early as Chap. 1 already, noise in
this chapter is treated from the perspective of noise modeling in ICs. The discussion
will start with an investigation of the sources of noise in general, which will
thereafter be followed by the noise modeling for active devices. Ideal passives do
not have sources of noise; the only exception is the resistor, which will be discussed
in Chap. 4. However, the mechanism of noise of a physical resistor will be the same
as that of the parasitic resistors in any transistor (or other passive devices), so
resistive noise sources will be treated here as well for the purpose of active device
noise modeling.

3.4.1
Sources of Noise
As noise is associated with random ﬂuctuations, noise sources are normally rep-
resented by an average value of the mean square variation around the average value
of either voltage or current. If the noise results in current ﬂuctuation of value
I around some value IAVE, then the mean-square value is
i2 ¼ I  IAVE
ð
Þ2:
ð3:38Þ
Voltage noise sources can be deﬁned similarly. When drawn, the noise sources
are drawn as the normal current or voltage sources, but without the indication of the
direction or polarity, which stems from the idea that the random signal ﬂuctuations
can appear in either direction.
Noise currents and voltages are expressed for a speciﬁc bandwidth, which was
introduced in Chap. 2 as the noise bandwidth B. Thus, to remove the bandwidth
from the noise source equations, normally the noise spectral density in either
amperes squared per hertz ði2=BÞ or volts squared per hertz ðv2=BÞ can also be
deﬁned (which normally simpliﬁes graphing). Shot noise, thermal noise, ﬂicker
noise, burst noise and avalanche noise all appear in integrated components [38].
Shot noise is associated with the direct current ﬂow in active devices. The
forward current across a pn-junction (diode) consists of holes from the p-region and
the electrons from the n-regions that have sufﬁcient energy to overcome the
potential of the barrier at the junction. However, sometimes a random event causes
the carriers to cross the junction, and this results in shot noise. Shot noise is
proportional to the direct current ID applied across the junction (diode):
i2 ¼ 2qIDB
ð3:39Þ
where ID is the junction (diode) current. It should be noted here that the shot noise
equation is valid until the frequency of operation of the electronic device becomes
comparable to 1/s, where s is the carrier transfer time through the depletion region.
Shot noise in the time domain is depicted in Fig. 3.12, which is perhaps the noise
representation used most often.

Thermal noise is due to the random movement of electrons in resistors excited
by temperature, and is consequently directly proportional to the absolute temper-
ature T. It can be expressed as either a current or a voltage, noting that i2 ¼ v2=R2,
where R is the resistance of the resistor in which noise appears:
i2 ¼ 4kTRB
ð3:40Þ
or
v2 ¼ 4kT 1
R B
ð3:41Þ
where 4kT can be evaluated at room temperature as 1.66  10−20 V-C.
Flicker noise is noise that is associated primarily with active devices, and it is
caused by the traps associated with contamination and crystal defects. Flicker noise
decreases with frequency with 1/f dependence, which has led to its alterative name:
1/f (one-over-f) noise. The noise current is calculated by
i2 ¼ K1
Ia
f b B
ð3:42Þ
where K1, a and b are constants for a particular device, with a and b both close to
unity. In fact, if all three constants are unity, then the spectral density of the ﬂicker
noise looks like that depicted in Fig. 3.13. This shows that the ﬂicker noise is
unlikely to be a problem in the millimeter-wave regime.
Two more sources of noise are associated with integrated circuits and transistors:
burst and avalanche noise. Burst noise has 1/f2 dependence, and is also applicable at
low frequencies only. Avalanche noise commonly occurs in Zener diodes, which
are avoided in low-noise circuitry, so these two types of noise will not be con-
sidered further.

3.4.2
MOSFET Modeling
As seen from the previous section, each active device will have several sources of
noise that can be deduced by looking at the physical structure of the devices. The
noise sources can then be placed into the small-signal models of the device, to build
more complete small-signal models. The noise modeling for MOSFETs will be
considered ﬁrst, followed by the modeling of bipolar transistors.
In a MOSFET, two sources of noise occur. The channel of the transistor is built
of resistive material, whose resistance changes with the change in the parameter gm
(which is related to the channel current ID). This causes the thermal noise to appear
as a current as well. If the frequency of operation is high enough so that the ﬂicker
noise is ignored, the noise current can be expressed as
i2
d ¼ 4kT K2gm
ð
ÞB
ð3:43Þ
where K2 is 2/3 for long-channel devices, but increases for short-channel devices
that are typically used in millimeter-wave applications.
The second source of noise is the noise due to gate currents. At DC, there is only
leakage current ﬂowing through the gate, so the shot noise
i2
g ¼ 2qIGB;
ð3:44Þ
is negligible. The situation changes, however, with an increase in frequency, where
thermal noise through the gate starts dominating. The current is then dependent on
the Cgs capacitive reactance Xgs = 1/xCgs, where x = 2pf, and drain-source con-
ductance at VDS = 0, gd0, resulting in the approximate formula [39]
i2
g ¼ K3kT
x2C2
gs
5gd0
B
ð3:45Þ
where K3 is another constant around 1 for large-channel devices and increases
drastically for short-channel devices. Since the gate is also associated with the
channel, the two thermal noises of the MOSFET are correlated.
With the noise sources added, the small-signal model of the MOSFET changes
to the one depicted in Fig. 3.14. It is often customary to transform all circuit noise
sources into a single noise current and noise voltage source, both applied at the
input, so that the rest of the circuit diagram can be considered noiseless, as illus-
trated in Fig. 3.15. Transformation is then performed as if the noise voltage or
current is any other voltage or current source in the circuit (not necessarily a noise
source). Assuming that the MOSFET is connected in a common-source conﬁgu-
ration and Cgd is ignored, only i2
d needs to be transformed, because i2
g appears at the

then from Eq. (3.43),

Note that for the loaded networks, the noise sources of the loading components
(e.g. resistors) can also be transformed to the input of the complete transistor
ampliﬁer network. However, in Chap. 2 it was shown that the noise ﬁgure of the
cascaded system is mostly determined by the noise ﬁgure of the ﬁrst stage, so any
input noise source of the following transistor ampliﬁer stage would be scaled by
gain twice and probably be negligible.
With a little manipulation, it can be shown that noise performance on the
MOSFET does not change even if it is conﬁgured in the common-gate or the
common-drain (source follower) conﬁguration; that is, the equivalent noise input
generators stay the same. In a source follower conﬁguration, where gain is actually
less than 1, however, the noise of the following ampliﬁer stage will not be scaled
down by the gain, and all the noise of the following stage will be transferred to the
input.
3.4.3
Bipolar Modeling
In a bipolar transistor, there are three noise sources, if it is once more assumed that
the transistor is operating at frequencies sufﬁciently large that the ﬂicker noise and
burst noise can be considered negligible.
With the two pn-junctions that are formed in the physical layout of the bipolar
transistor, there are two sources of shot noise. Under the assumption that the
transistor is operating in the forward active region, the shot noise will arise due to
currents IB and IC, respectively:
i2
b ¼ 2qIBB;
ð3:48Þ
and
i2
c ¼ 2qICB:
ð3:49Þ
The third noise source is the thermal noise due to the physical base resistor rb.
Although in the small-signal model there are two more resistors, rp and ro, they are
not physical resistors and they do not contribute to noise. This is the reason why ro
was not mentioned in the discussion on the noise of MOSFETs either. The resistor
rc also has shot noise, but it is typically ignored because in usual ampliﬁer con-
ﬁgurations, another much more noisy component is connected in series with it. The
thermal noise can be then expressed as a voltage:
v2
b ¼ 4kTrbB:
ð3:50Þ
The complete small-signal model then appears as depicted in Fig. 3.17.
3.4
Transistor Modeling for Noise
103

Assuming that the transistor is now connected in the common-emitter conﬁgu-
ration, similar manipulations to those done for the MOSFET can be done for the
bipolar transistor to replace the noise sources with the equivalent input noise
generators. If the output in the small-signal diagram in Fig. 3.17 is short-circuited
and Cl and Ccs are ignored, by deﬁnition of the input noise generator the sum of the
noise current ic and current due to vb (gmvb) has to be equal to the current due to the
input voltage generator (gmvi), or more formally,
gmvb þ ic ¼ gmvi:

The updated small-signal circuit then looks like the circuit in Fig. 3.18. As with
MOSFETs, the equivalent input generator for other bipolar transistor ampliﬁers is
the same.
Earlier it was discussed that the forward current gain (b(jx)) of the bipolar
transistor decreases with frequency. As a consequence, Eq. (3.53), suggests strong
dependence on the frequency of the second term of the equivalent input current
noise. This can be seen in Fig. 3.19. As transistor fT increases, so does the pole in
the frequency response of b(jx), meaning that transistor technologies with high fT
also improve the noise performance. The relationship that deﬁnes the tipping point
at which the noise due to current IC becomes dominant is fairly easy to ﬁnd by

In the ongoing efforts to improve the performance of the HBTs in SiGe BiCMOS
technologies for ever-increasing frequencies, the noise ﬁgure of an HBT was
identiﬁed as an additional metric of the performance of the technology and was
researched in considerable detail. Niu et al. [44, 45] have published a number of
papers pertaining to the tradeoffs between the noise ﬁgure and, among others, the
gain in the HBTs.

From this equation, it can be seen that in order to improve the noise ﬁgure,
higher current gain, lower parasitic resistances (higher fT) and lower rb all improve
the noise ﬁgure. This means that the best practice in improving the noise ﬁgure is to
increase fT of the technology while attempting to keep the forward gain high. The
increase in fT is in line with Eq. (3.54), but it should be noted that higher current
gains remain to inﬂuence the location of the zero marking the point at which the
noise switches from white noise to noise that increases with frequency.

Concluding Remarks
In this chapter, LNAs were examined from the perspective of integrated circuit
technologies that are suitable for millimeter-wave research. It was deduced that an
increased number of transistor technologies have emerged recently with high
transitional frequencies (in the range of several hundreds of GHz); this is typically
used as a metric for suitability of integration for the millimeter-wave regime. It was
later shown that both the transistor gain and noise performance are dependent on the
transitional frequency, and that high transitional frequencies are thus paramount for
low-noise design. It was shown that HEMT and HBT transistors are the most
suitable active devices capable of these increased frequencies, but that the main
research focus remains on CMOS and BiCMOS technologies, where low cost and
high integration densities can be reached. BiCMOS technology further has the
advantage of offering both the MOSFET and bipolar transistor, which aids in
accomplishing single-chip solutions for many applications that require the use of
analog, digital and RF circuitry. SoP, where different technologies can be included
in a single package that offers the possibility of implementation of advanced cir-
cuitry with short interconnects, was also shown to be a viable alternative for LNAs
in the millimeter-wave regime. The rest of the chapter then moved on to discuss the
modeling of ﬁeld-effect and bipolar transistors, both for high frequency and noise.
Although all technologies inevitably include passive devices, such as resistors,
capacitors and inductors, the suitability of passive components also needs to be
discussed. This discussion is deferred until the following chapter, which will focus
on the options for passive component implementation and challenges in passive
component research, speciﬁcally for millimeter-wave applications.

Chapter 4
Passives for Low-Noise Ampliﬁers
Abstract This chapter looks at numerous alternatives for implementing passive
components. It covers the basic theory of transmission lines and illustrate how
transmission-line terminations can be used to turn the line into a resistive, capac-
itive or inductive distributed element. Various lumped topologies for resistors,
capacitors and inductors are discussed in detail, whether implemented on chip, on
package, or discreetly. Active alternatives for implementation of passives is also
considered. Emerging technologies for the implementation of passives, such as
micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) or other fabrication methods are also
mentioned. In view of its importance for LNA design, a substantial portion of this
chapter is dedicated to different inductor implementations and modeling of
inductors.
In Chap. 3, the discussion about active devices as applicable to LNA research was
completed, and the chapter ended with a note that passive devices are as important
for LNA performance as active devices. Passive devices (resistors, capacitors and
inductors) are therefore discussed in this chapter. As the frequency increases
towards the RF and millimeter-wave bands deﬁned in Chap. 2, the Q-factor of
capacitors and inductor devices becomes an important loss mechanism that needs to
be considered. At millimeter wave frequencies, the Q-factor is not only important
for inductors, but also for capacitors. In this chapter, it will be seen that the Q-factor
of an inductor or a capacitor actually increases with frequency, but because of
component parasitics, this wanted behavior only occurs up to a certain frequency, at
which the resonance occurs. To ensure the intended use of the component (that is,
operation below resonance), the modeling of passives becomes increasingly
important (and thus, more complex). Each passive implementation is modeled
differently, which requires special focus to be placed on different types of passive
implementations. Although at millimeter-wave the use of transmission lines on chip
is possible and typically encouraged, if lumped elements are properly designed,
they can actually result in superior performance or even smaller ﬂoorplans than
those of transmission lines, even at millimeter wave frequencies.

The primary challenge of passive component design is selecting the correct
topology and dimension for each component to avoid excessive losses [1]. Thus,
this chapter will look at numerous alternatives for implementing passive compo-
nents. It will cover the basic theory of transmission lines and illustrate how
transmission-line terminations can be used to turn the line into a resistive, capac-
itive or inductive distributed element. Various lumped topologies for resistors,
capacitors and inductors will be discussed in detail, whether implemented on chip,
on package, or discreetly. Active alternatives for implementation of passives will
also be considered. Emerging technologies for the implementation of passives, such
as micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) or other fabrication methods will
also be mentioned. In view of its importance for LNA design, a substantial portion
of this chapter will be dedicated to different inductor implementations and modeling
of inductors.
A component that is very closely related to the inductor is the transformer, which
is used for coupling of circuits. A variation of the transformer, viz. the balun, is also
available and can be found in some state-of-the-art LNA designs, speciﬁcally in
differential LNA topologies. Both variations will be handled in this chapter. Strictly
speaking, the antenna is also a passive component, but antennas were already
discussed in Chap. 2.
Before discussing the physical implementation of resistors, capacitors and
inductors, the opening two sections will discuss the concept of the Q-factor, fol-
lowed by an introductory discussion on transmission lines, including the very
special case of the quarter-wave transmission line. A separate discussion on
transmission lines is needed because they are able to play many roles, including
transporting signals between structures, impedance matching, or, as mentioned
before, for creating inductive or capacitive elements [1].
4.1
Quality Factor
The Q-factor of a device is deﬁned as 2p times the ratio of energy stored and lost in
one oscillation cycle. If Z is the impedance of such a device, then its Q-factor is
given by
Q ¼ ImðZÞ
ReðZÞ :
ð4:1Þ
Thus the Q-factor of a capacitor can be deﬁned as
Q ¼ XC
Rtotal
;
ð4:2Þ
112

Passives for Low-Noise Ampliﬁers

where XC is the capacitor reactance and Rtotal is the total capacitor equivalent
resistance. The Q-factor of an inductor can be deﬁned similarly to the Q-factor of
the capacitor. Thus
Q ¼ XL
RS
;
ð4:3Þ
where XL is the inductor reactance and RS is the total inductor equivalent resistance.
The concept of the component quality factor will be used throughout this chapter as
a measure of performance of the particular passive component implementation.
4.2
Transmission Lines
A transmission line is a structure specialized to carry RF and microwave signals.
The waves propagate in a quasi-transverse electromagnetic (TEM) mode [2, 3].
These waves have uniquely deﬁned voltage, current and characteristic impedance.
As discussed in earlier chapters of this book, the length of a typical transmission
line at millimeter-wave frequencies allows for transmission line integration, which
makes them highly popular in modern integrated LNA applications, especially
because longer lines can be bent (meandered) to reduce the chip area [4]. Note
however, that the secondary dimension of the transmission line (e.g. length in case
of the microstrip line as deﬁned later) does not depend on frequency, which does
hinder integration somewhat (for example, it may be difﬁcult to make a T-junction).
By deﬁnition, transmission lines are passive components, with Q-factors that
increase in frequency, which forms a very desirable property in the millimeter-wave
design. Transmission lines are also characterized by insertion loss, which, unfor-
tunately, also increases with frequency. Another advantage of quasi-TEM lines is
that the well-deﬁned ground return path reduces electric and magnetic ﬁeld cou-
pling to adjacent structures [5].
Uses
of
transmission
lines
in

circuitry
are
numerous.
A transmission line can be conﬁgured to appear either as a capacitor or as an
inductor, depending on the transmission line length in relation to the wavelength of
operation of the designed circuitry. The required values of reactances can be made
very precise, even for small reactance values. Furthermore, if the length of the
transmission line is exactly one-quarter of the wavelength, a special type of
transmission line, the quarter-wavelength transformer, is generated. This compo-
nent can be used, among others, as an impedance converter. It can also act as an
RFC, or it can be used for impedance matching of real sources or loads.
The mathematics behind different behavior scenarios of the transmission lines
will be presented in later sections of this chapter. In this section, however, it is
necessary to discuss types of transmission lines, followed by the model of a general
transmission line and the deﬁnition of the concept of its characteristic impedance.

4.2.1
Types of Transmission Lines
TEM propagation can be achieved by several transmission line conﬁgurations,
including two-wire, coaxial, coplanar and microstrip waveguides.
In the millimeter-wave regime, microstrip and coplanar waveguide transmission
lines are most popular, with a unique set of beneﬁts to the microelectronic circuit.
A coplanar waveguide (CPW) has a single conducting track of width w and
thickness t and a pair of return conducting tracks, at a distance d away from the
forward conducting tracks, with all three tracks printed on a dielectric substrate.
Conducting return tracks are laid out so that they extend a large distance away from
the main conductor. The fact that the return path is fabricated on the same layer as
the conducting path means that most of the electromagnetic ﬁeld concentrates
around the slot area, which in turn minimizes substrate losses. Sometimes, a ground
plane some distance b below the three conductors is included as an additional return
path, as illustrated in Fig. 4.1. A microstrip waveguide consists of a thin conducting
strip of width w and thickness t, placed above a ground plane at some distance b, as
illustrated in Fig. 4.2.
If the Q-factors of each line are considered alone, microstrip lines in general can
be conﬁgured as capacitors with high Q-factors. In turn, CPWs can be conﬁgured as
inductors with high Q-factors [1]. To build high-Q inductive microstrip lines, large
substrate heights are needed, which is achievable on typical PCBs but not in typical
integrated processes, which are typically tailored for digital technologies. In the
case of capacitive microstrip lines, especially for matching, microstrip lines are
particularly appealing because they are less prone to metal thickness variations
than, for example, metal capacitors [4]. In the design of LNAs, inductors are very
important, which makes CPW somewhat more popular than microstrip lines.
Microelectronic foundries typically provide p-cells and models for both of these
transmission lines.

4.2.2
General Transmission Line
Each transmission line is fully deﬁned by four parameters: resistance R, inductance
L, conductance G and capacitance C [3], all deﬁned for unit length dx. Each of the
four parameters mentioned depends on the material properties as well as on the type
and geometry of the line and can be calculated and/or experimentally determined
and this information is normally provided by the foundry. A general transmission
line is then typically modeled by means of the circuit diagram in Fig. 4.3.
An important parameter of every lossy transmission line is its characteristic
impedance. It can be obtained with the following complex equation:
Z0 ¼
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
R þ jxL
G þ jxC
s
;
ð4:4Þ
where x = 2pf is the frequency at which the signal is propagating. If short line
segments are used, as is typically the case, R and G can be considered negligible
and the line will be lossless. In that case the characteristic impedance equation has a
real result and simpliﬁes to
Z0 ¼
ﬃﬃﬃﬃ
L
C

ð4:5Þ
At this stage it is important to deﬁne the wavelength of the line and the phase
constant. The wavelength is
k ¼

ð4:6Þ
The phase constant is the measure of the change in phase per unit length along
the path traveled by the wave at any instance and it can be expressed in terms of
either wavelength or frequency:
b ¼ 2p
k ¼ xLC:
ð4:7Þ

Deﬁning the attenuation constant a allows for the deﬁnition of the quality factor
of the transmission line to be expressed as:
Q ¼ b
2a :
ð4:8Þ
Some simpliﬁcations can be performed if it is known whether the line is
capacitive or inductive. A capacitive lossy line will have a quality factor deﬁned by
QC ¼ x C
G ;
ð4:9Þ
and similarly the inductive line will have a quality factor
QL ¼ x L
R :
ð4:10Þ
One useful property of the microstrip line (other than high QC) is that its
characteristic impedance can be controlled by changing the height of the substrate
on which the line is laid out (denoted by h) and the transmission line width (denoted
by w). Approximate equations can be obtained for narrow microstrip lines
(w/h < 1) and wide lines (w/h > 1), if the thickness of the conductor forming the
line is negligible compared to the substrate height. The characteristic impedance of
the narrow line is

Knowing the characteristic impedance allows for the computation of the input
impedance of a lossless transmission line of arbitrary length l and terminated with
an arbitrary load resistance ZL:
Zin ¼ Z0
ZL þ jZ0 tan bl
Z0 þ jZL tan bl :
ð4:16Þ
From Eq. (4.16), it is evident how a general line can be conﬁgured for any
impedance (real, complex–inductive or complex–capacitive) by simply changing its
length l, as discussed in the opening section of this chapter. In this section, the
length equal to a quarter wavelength will be used to describe the quarter-wave
transformer, while the capacitive and the inductive behavior of transmission lines
will be handled in the sections on capacitors and inductors.
4.2.3
The Quarter-Wave Transformer
Computing the input impedance of the quarter-wave transformer will illustrate its
behavior. A quarter-wave transformer with characteristic impedance Z1, connected
to another transmission line with characteristic impedance Z0, is illustrated in
Fig. 4.4 [2].
The fact that the quarter-wave transformer has a length of l = k/4 results in the
simpliﬁcation
bl ¼ p

Therefore, at the fundamental frequency, the quarter-wave transformer acts as an
impedance inverter. Some other interesting properties of the quarter-wave trans-
former can be seen for special values of the load impedance ZL. The simplest case is
when the transformer is terminated with a purely resistive load (e.g. an antenna). If
Z1 is now chosen to be equal to R, then Eq. (4.18) simpliﬁes to
Zin ¼ R2
R ¼ R:
ð4:19Þ
Alternatively, the quarter-wave transformer can be terminated with the resonant
tank, as illustrated in Fig. 4.5. At the resonance frequency x0 of the tank, the
transformer will appear purely resistive, and the input impedance is as seen in
Eq. (4.19). Furthermore, at even harmonics, the transformer will have zero impe-
dance and at odd harmonics, it will have inﬁnite impedance, with the mathematics
as follows.
At even harmonics (n = 2k), bl = 2k(p/2) = kp, and tan kp = 0, thus
Zin ¼ Z1
ZL þ jZ1  0
Z1 þ jZL  0 ¼ ZL;

and the quarter-wave acts as an impedance repeater. The impedance of the resonant
tank far from the resonant frequency f0 tends to zero, so Eq. (4.20) simpliﬁes to
Zin  0:

At odd harmonics, the impedance can be computed directly from Eq. (4.18) by
still noting that the load tends to zero:

Again, if the load impedance is real, the quarter-wave transformer can be used to
match this resistance to another real impedance. With the addition of short inductive
or capacitive stubs, matching to any complex loads can be accomplished as well.

As shown earlier, microstrip lines can be used to create structures with virtually
any characteristic impedances. This is accomplished by ﬁnding width w and the
substrate height h for a speciﬁc substrate material. If the height and width of the
microstrip line result in unrealistic line aspect ratios, it may be feasible to introduce
more than one quarter-wave transformer section. A two quarter-wave transformer

Having multiple quarter-wave transformers also allows the designer to optimize
the bandwidth of the matching network. In fact, any number of quarter-wave
transformers can be used. With every next transformer, the microstrip line is nar-
rower (or wider, depending on the impedances), thus forming a long tapered
transmission line, with lengths that could be practical at millimeter-wave
frequencies.
As suspected from the previous discussion, the bandwidth of the quarter-wave
transformer is only dependent of the characteristic impedance, thus the bandwidth
of this component could be a limiting factor in some designs. It can be shown that
the bandwidth is

4.3
Resistors
A resistor is an electronic component that provides a required voltage drop by
converting some of the electrical energy into heat [3]. Both integrated and discrete
resistors are typically used for LNAs and at millimeter-wave frequencies.
Alternatively, resistors can be implemented on discrete substrates, in SoP
implementations.
In integrated circuitry, resistors are fairly easy to fabricate by using layers with
different (high or low) resistivity, depending on the required resistance value. The
layout of a typical integrated resistor is shown in Fig. 4.8. Layers typically used are the
n-well, polysilicon and metal layers, depending on whether high, moderate or low
resistances need to be obtained. Foundries normally provide the resistivity of a par-
ticular layer in X/square. Resistance can then be determined simply by counting the
number of squares. Contact resistance also plays a role, but its inﬂuence is limited to
short resistors built in low-resistivity layers. In typical designs, resistor segmenting and
segment matching are used to achieve better-controlled resistances, that is, to remove
the inﬂuence of the resistivity gradient that may appear during layer fabrication.

On the other hand, discrete inductors generally used in millimeter-wave elec-
tronics include carbon composite resistors, wire-wound resistors, metal-ﬁlm resis-
tors and thin-ﬁlm resistors. Thin-ﬁlm resistors are similar to integrated resistors in
the sense that they are laid out in a specialized process, but using materials that are
not typically available for integrated processes. Typical materials are nichrome
(a nickel-chromium alloy) and sichrome (a mixture of silicon and chromium).
The impedance of an ideal resistor is constant at all frequencies. In real resistors,
however, as frequency increases, parasitics start playing a more prominent role. The
way the impedance changes with frequency depends on the physical properties of
the resistor. Models of two types of resistor are shown in Fig. 4.9. Figure 4.9a
shows a general model of a resistor, with R as the actual resistance of the resistor,
L as the resistor lead inductance and Ca and Cb as various parasitic capacitances. In
Fig. 4.9b, the wire-wound resistor is shown. This model features an additional
inductance LW resulting from the inﬂuence of the wire windings.
The resistor model parameters can be computed as described below. The
resistance of a general (thin-ﬁlm) resistor can be worked out in a similar manner as
the resistance of integrated resistors. The resistance of the wire-wound resistor is
given by
R ¼

where q = 1/r is the resistivity of the material. The inductance in microhenries of
the leads can be determined via the equation for the inductance of the straight piece
of wire [6]:

ð4:31Þ
where l is the length of the wire and d = 2a is the wire diameter. Wire-wound
inductance is computed using the inductance formula that will be presented later.
Finally, parasitic capacitances depend on the exact resistor implementation and the
computation of these will not be mentioned here.
A typical frequency response of the impedance of a thin-ﬁlm resistor and a
wire-wound resistor may look something like the illustration in Fig. 4.10. In the
case of a thin-ﬁlm resistor, the capacitive effect is visible above a certain frequency,
and as frequency continues to increase, an inductive effect becomes more promi-
nent. The turning point of the impedance marks the resonant frequency of the
resistor. On the other hand, wire-wound resistors are more strongly inﬂuenced by
inductive parasitics, with the capacitive effects coming into play only above reso-
nance. In certain instances, even multiple resonance points may exist in the graph of
the impedance of a real resistor.
4.4
Capacitors
Capacitors are used to store energy electrostatically in an electric ﬁeld. A typical
capacitor consists of two parallel plates separated by an insulator layer (e.g. cera-
mic, plastic glass, metalized ﬁlm or even air). If the surface area A of the plates is
large compared to its separation distance d, the capacitance can be calculated by [3]

where e0 is the absolute permittivity deﬁned in Chap. 3 and er is the relative
permittivity of the dielectric material used. Mica capacitors, for example, have a
dielectric constant of about 6, making them fairly large [6], and these capacitors
have a good temperature coefﬁcient. On the other hand, ceramic capacitors have
dielectric constants up to 10,000 but worse temperature performance.
The magnitude of the impedance of an ideal capacitor decreases with frequency.
Discrete, integrated and transmission-line capacitors, however, all have differing
real-life behavior and will all be treated in separate sections.
4.4.1
Discrete Capacitors
In addition to the capacitance deﬁned previously, a high-frequency model of a
typical discrete capacitor also needs to include losses due to lead conductors
(modeled by resistance RS and inductance L) and the dielectric loss resistance Re.
The resulting circuit diagram is illustrated in Fig. 4.11. RS and L are computed with
resistor equations deﬁned in Sect. 4.3, while Re is deﬁned as
Re ¼
d
rdielA ;
ð4:33Þ
where rdiel is the conductivity of the dielectric material. The frequency response of
the magnitude of the impedance of ideal and real capacitors is shown in Fig. 4.12.
This ﬁgure illustrates that the lead inductances cause an appearance of a resonant
frequency. The resonant frequency values are ﬁnite owing to the presence of
resistances in the capacitor model.
The Q-factor of discrete capacitors is generally not a problem at RF and
microwave frequencies.
4.4.2
Integrated Capacitors
Integrated capacitors are implemented by using two polysilicon (poly) layers or two
metal layers and an insulating material between the two layers. Therefore, the two

types of capacitors are named poly-insulator-poly (PIP) and metal-insulator-metal
(MIM) capacitors. A MIM capacitor is illustrated in Fig. 4.13. A PIP capacitor is
virtually the same, except that the two metals in this ﬁgure are replaced with poly.
MIM is, however, preferred in RF applications as it can achieve better Q-factors
than PIP.
The process substrate effect plays an additional role in the model of a MIM or a
PIP capacitor. A typical MIM model is shown in Fig. 4.14 [7], where ﬁrst, para-
sitics due to two leads are separated into parasitics for the bottom and the top plates,
and second, capacitances Cox, Csub and resistance Rsub are included. Cox forms
because of the oxide below the bottom plate, and Csub and Rsub form because of the
substrate. The oxide and substrate parasitics are approximately proportional to
the area of the capacitor, but are also highly dependent on the conductivity of the
substrate and the operating frequency. The mechanism of formation of these par-
asitics is identical to the parasitics that form for integrated inductors, so the
mathematical analysis is deferred until the part of the chapter that deals with
inductors.

The capacitance value of an integrated capacitor is deterministic, allowing that a
carefully controlled capacitance value to be obtained simply by choosing the width
and the length of the capacitor in an IC implementation. IC design is also supported
by the accurate models of capacitors from the foundry side. Furthermore, if p-cells
are provided, then these allow designers to change the width and length of the
capacitor until the required capacitance is reached.
The frequency response of the capacitance and the Q-factor of a typical MIM
capacitor are shown in Fig. 4.15. As expected, the Q-factor, being proportional to
the capacitive reactance, decreases with frequency, from about 20 at 20 GHz to less
than 5 at 100 GHz in a 130 nm process. This means that the quality of capacitors
even at millimeter-wave frequencies should not be of great concern to researchers
[7].
At millimeter-wave frequencies, interdigital capacitors with high Q-factors but
limited capacitance values [8] can be used in addition to PIP and MIM capacitors.
A drawing of an interdigital capacitor is shown in Fig. 4.16 [9]. In CMOS and
BiCMOS, it is also possible to use MOS transistors as capacitors.
An alternative to passive MIM, PIP and interdigital capacitors can be found in
active capacitors [7]. One such conﬁguration is the single-ended active capacitor
(SAC) conﬁguration shown in Fig. 4.17, which could present an advantage at
frequencies reaching 100 GHz and beyond. It can be shown that impedance ZSAC in
this ﬁgure will have a negative (capacitive) value.

Transmission-Line Capacitors
Earlier in this chapter it was mentioned that a lossless transmission line can be
conﬁgured as either an inductor or a capacitor by changing the length of the line
(l) and load impedance (ZL) in Eq. (4.15), for a speciﬁc characteristic impedance Z0.
If the transmission line is connected only on one side and then short- or
open-circuited on the other, a stub is created. The short-circuited stub will have an
impedance of
Zin ¼ Z0
0 þ jZ0 tan bl
Z0 þ jð0Þ tan bl ¼ jZ0 tan bl:
ð4:34Þ
Therefore, the short-circuited stubs will be capacitive for lengths between k/4
and k/2 [10] (that is, tanbl will return a negative value). The open-circuited stub
will have an impedance of
Zin ¼ lim

Open-circuited stubs are capacitive for lengths lower than k/4 because in this
case, tanbl needs to be made positive to retain the minus sign [10].
Wider stubs can realize larger shunt capacitances for a given length, but are
impractical in connecting to the rest of the circuitry, and often radial stubs, such as
the one shown in Fig. 4.18, are used.

Inductors
The inductor (coil) is a passive electronic device that stores energy in its magnetic
ﬁeld when current passes through the device. A general model of the inductor is
shown in Fig. 4.19 [3, 11], where resistor RS and capacitor CS are added to model
the losses, even at frequencies below RF.
The behavior of the reactance of the real inductor, similar to that of the real
capacitor, exhibits a resonant frequency peak, whereas the reactance of the ideal
inductor increases with constant slope as frequency increases. This is illustrated in
Fig. 4.20. Once more, the resonant frequency should ideally peak at inﬁnity, but the
ﬁnite value of the peak is due to the resistance RS. Similarly, capacitance CS is the
reason the inductor exhibits capacitive instead of inductive behavior at frequencies
above the resonance.

The Q-factor of an inductor is much more heavily dependent on the frequency
than that of a capacitor. Thus careful design of the inductor is needed. This fact and
numerous other factors lead to numerous inductor implementation options, with the
list growing as efforts to ﬁnd better inductors continue. These include discrete
inductors, active integrated inductors, bond wires, passive integrated inductors (e.g.
spiral inductors), MEMS inductors and other on-chip or on-package/in-package
implementations. Each of the above options is discussed in more detail in the
sections that follow.
4.5.1
Discrete Inductors
Figure 4.21 shows two types of discrete lumped inductors. The simpler of the two
is the solenoidal inductor, which involves an air core around which a single layer of
wire is wound. For radius r (in cm), length l (in cm) and number of turns N, the
resulting inductance in microhenries is [6]
L ¼ 0:394r2N2
9r þ 10l :
ð4:36Þ
Because of the length of the wire that is needed to build this inductor, the
resistance across the wire is not negligible and is computed using the
wire-resistance equation described earlier (Eq. 4.29). Air core inductors are
impractical millimeter wave applications. Thus most inductors that are meant to be
used at high frequencies are designed with cores manufactured with magnetic
materials, such as iron on ferrite. They allow for a smaller size and an increased
Q-factor owing to the lower number of turns required to achieve the same induc-
tance as air-gap inductors.

Passives for Low-Noise Ampliﬁers

As an alternative to solenoidal inductors, toroid inductors are commonly used.
They are in essence magnetic-core solenoidal inductors, curved such that they
assume a ring or doughnut shape. The main advantage of toroids is their
self-shielding capability. Toroidal inductor inductance in nH is given by
L ¼ 0:004pN2liAc
le
;
ð4:37Þ
where Ac is the cross-sectional area of the core in cm2, le is the effective length of
the core in cm and li is the initial magnetic permeability. Initial magnetic perme-
ability is permeability at low magnetic ﬁelds, a relative quantity typically greater
than 500 for ferrite. Some inductor manufacturers combine all quantities other than
the number of turns into a single constant for the inductor core, called the induc-
tance index, AL (in nH/turn2). In terms of inductance index, the toroidal inductance
in nH is then
L ¼ N2AL:
ð4:38Þ
The Q-factor of commercial off-the shelf inductors can typically reach 100 and
above, and is achieved in the low-gigahertz range. This makes these inductors
mostly impractical for millimeter-wave design, so either transmission lines or
integrated inductors are preferred, as discussed in the following sections of this
chapter.
Spiral inductors printed on a PCB substrate can also be considered discrete and
their design is very similar to that of integrated spiral inductors, discussed later.
4.5.2
Integrated Active Inductors
As seen before, well into the millimeter-wave range, there is no real advantage to
active integrated capacitors because passive capacitors exhibit acceptable Q-factors.
The case of inductors is, however, somewhat different. High-Q integrated active
inductors are a good alternative to passive integrated inductors, because passive
integrated inductors typically have low Q-factors, as will be seen later. Typical
improvement in the Q-factors of the active inductors over those of the passive
inductors is up to ten times, that is, Q-factors of between 10 and 100 can be reached
[12]. Another advantage seen with active inductors is that they can also take up a
smaller area on the chip than spiral inductors. Disadvantages include increased
power consumption, the presence of electrical noise from active devices and limited
dynamic range.
Some active inductors employ a linear two-port network that does not absorb or
dissipate energy (a gyrator) [13]; an example is shown in Fig. 4.22. Additional
examples of active inductor designs can be seen in [12, 14]. For example, Ler et al.
4.5
Inductors
129

[14] demonstrated a six-transistor design measuring only 30 µm by 65 µm, which
makes active inductors much more compact compared to traditional designs
requiring ten transistors or more.
4.5.3
Bond Wires
In semiconductor packaging, bond wires present very thin metals used to connect
the bonding pads of an IC to pin leads of the IC package [15]. Bond wires are
typically thinner than the human hair [9]. They normally present a parasitic quantity
in IC design [16]; if their behavior is analyzed, it can be shown that it is inductive,
which can be used as an advantage in RF and millimeter wave design.
Electrical characteristics of bond wires are dependent on the type of material of
which they are made, the wire radius and the horizontal length [17]. Typically, they
are made of gold, copper, or aluminum. Inductance in henries of the bond wire is
approximated as [18]:
L ¼ l0l
2p
ln 2l
a  0:75


;
ð4:39Þ
where l is the length of the bond wire, a is the radius of the wire and l0 is the
absolute permeability (4p  10−7 H/m). To achieve higher inductances, more than
one bond wire can be used. The mutual inductance of adjacent bond wires is then
approximated as
M ¼ l0l
2p
ln 2l
s  s
l  1


;
ð4:40Þ
where s is the spacing between two wires. The main parasitic in the bond wire is its
resistance, which can once more be calculated using the previously described wire
formula. This results in the two bond wire models, as shown in Fig. 4.23.
The Q-factor of the bond wire can be calculated by assuming the simplest series
inductance-resistance model. Any additional parasitics of the bond wire can be
decreased by placing the wire well above any conducting planes, which allows high
Q-factors (up to 50) and high resonance frequencies to be obtained.
One drawback of the bond wire, as seen from the literature, is its achievable
inductance value. A Bond-wire inductance is typically less than 1 nH [17], which

limits the feasibility of the bond wire in the gigahertz range. This might not be a
problem in the millimeter-wave range, but the question of repeatability of the
inductance value does remain.
4.5.4
Ribbon Inductors
Ribbon inductors are inductors made from short, narrow microstrip tracks, as
illustrated in Fig. 4.24 [9]. For lengths of the transmission line less than one quarter
wavelength and with characteristic impedance Z0, the ribbon inductor will have a

Spiral Inductors
Spiral integrated inductors have traditionally been used in practical RF and micro-
wave implementation. This was due to the fact that even though the integrated spiral
inductor is a complex structure, a number of deterministic models exist that can be
used to predict the inductance value and Q-factors of any inductive structure on chip,
given that the process parameters and geometry of the inductor are known. Also,
spiral inductors are known to include more inductance per unit area deep into

millimeter-wave frequencies. Several authors have investigated and shown that it is
still possible to include spiral inductors in the millimeter-wave range. For example,
more than a decade ago Yao et al. [19] demonstrated a 29 lm by 29 lm square spiral
inductor reaching inductance of 140 pF and a Q-factor of 30. More recently, a 55 nm

dedicated
to
millimeter-wave applications was presented by Chevalier et al. [20]. Thus, spiral
inductor implementations cannot be ignored for millimeter-wave applications either.
Spiral inductors are laid out in several shapes, most commonly as square, cir-
cular, hexagonal and octagonal inductors [21], as illustrated in Fig. 4.25. The
original popularity of the square spiral comes from the fact that some older IC
processes constrained all angles to 90° [22]. Square inductors, however, have the
lowest Q-factors of the four mentioned, with the circular spiral, which most closely
resembles a solenoid, having the highest Q-factor. As the layout process of the
circular inductor is usually complex, hexagons and octagons are used more often.
Alternatively, tapering (Fig. 4.26), that decreases eddy current losses in the inner
turns in order to increase the Q-factor, can be used. This it is most effective when
substrate losses are negligible, which is achievable with the MEMS approach
discussed later.
The above geometries require only a single metal layer for fabrication and are
consequently asymmetric and have only one underpass, i.e., the additional layer that
serves to bring the signal lines from the center to the edge of an inductor. An
additional metal layer can be used to build a ground plane to act as a shield from the
substrate. This concept will be illustrated in Chap. 8. To build symmetrical
inductors, like the one illustrated in Fig. 4.27, a metal-level interchange is needed
[22]. Alternatively, the second metal layer can be used to build a two-layer inductor,
such as that shown in Fig. 4.28 [23]. Multi-layer inductors use mutual inductance
coupling of different layers to yield higher inductance values, while decreasing the
inductor ﬂoorplan. Another way of decreasing the inductor ﬂoorplan is by
deploying nested inductors, as shown in Fig. 4.29 where inductor L2 is placed
inside inductor L1 [24].

4.5.5.1
Spiral Inductor Models
Several spiral inductor models have found widespread use, depending on the
required modeling complexity. These include the single-p model, segmented
model, double-p model and third-order models.
The single-p nine-component conﬁguration shown in Fig. 4.30 [21, 25] is the
model used most commonly in literature. In this model, LS is the design inductance
at the given frequency, RS is the parasitic resistance and CS is the parasitic
capacitance of the spiral inductor structure. Parasitic parameters have already been
deﬁned for capacitors: Cox is the parasitic capacitance due to oxide layers directly
under the metal inductor structure and Csub and Rsub represent the parasitic
capacitance and resistance due to the substrate (typically silicon), respectively.
Seeing that this circuit does not model the distributive capacitive effects, this model
is suitable for use for frequencies up to several gigahertz. This circuit, however,
models correctly for parasitic effects of the metal spiral and the oxide below the
spiral, as well as for substrate effects, and the inductor is modeled accurately for
frequencies below resonance [26].

The single-p inductor model, although not quite as accurate at millimeter-wave
frequencies, is key to understanding integrated inductor behavior. Some models
more suitable at millimeter-wave frequencies will be discussed later, but without
detailed mathematics.
4.5.5.2
Inductance and Parasitic Component Values for the Single-p
Inductor Model
To fully specify the spiral inductor, other than its shape, the number of turns (n), the
turn width (w), inner diameter (din) and outer diameter (dout) all need to be known.
The locations of these measurements are shown in Fig. 4.31 for the commonly used
octagonal inductors. The total length of a spiral is dependent on the inductor
geometry and for a square inductor, the equation is the simplest:
l ¼ 4ðdin þ wÞ þ 2nð2n  1Þðs þ wÞ;
ð4:43Þ
where s is the spacing between the turns of the spiral, and it can be calculated for
given din, dout, w and n as

Several equations are commonly used in literature to represent the series
inductance LS of spiral inductors with various levels of accuracy. The modiﬁed
Wheeler equation, current-sheet equation, Bryan’s equation and monomial
expression are four equations that are commonly used. The data-ﬁtted monomial
expression results in the smallest error of the four. The monomial expression has
been developed by curve ﬁtting over a family of 19,000 inductors [21]. Therefore,
inductance in nH is calculated as [21, 27]:

Parasitic resistance RS is dependent on the frequency of operation because of the
skin-depth phenomenon and eddy current formation. This means that at DC,
resistance value is mostly determined by the sheet resistance of the material of
which the wire is made; as is the case with discrete inductors and at higher fre-
quencies, this value is surpassed by the resistance that arises from the formation of
eddy currents.
Resistance is governed by the resistivity of the metal layer in which the inductor
is laid out (q), the total length of the spiral, the width of each turn and the effective
thickness of the spiral (teff) [29]:

Parasitic capacitance CS is the sum of all the capacitances created between the

In order to calculate the oxide capacitance Cox and substrate capacitance Csub,
the effective thickness (teff) and effective dielectric constant (eeff) of either oxide or
substrate must ﬁrst be determined, as well as the effective conductivity of the
substrate. The effective thickness of both oxide and substrate is computed as [30]

Quality Factor and Resonance Frequency for Single-p

The Q-factor of the single-p inductor model is inﬂuenced by three types of loss
[31]. The ﬁrst factor
F1 ¼ xLS=RS

is the intrinsic (nominal) Q-factor of the overall inductance that was seen in the

This resonant frequency due to the total capacitance CP + CS can be isolated by
equating F3 to zero, and solving for fr. This results in the formula for the

Each of the three factors restricts the performance of the inductor of the Q-factor
at a different frequency range. At lower frequencies, the loss of the metal line (F1)
has the most prominent effect [33]. As the frequency increases, the loss of substrate
(F2) prevails as the restricting factor. This factor is greatly inﬂuenced by the
resistivity of the substrate. At a ﬁxed frequency, as resistivity decreases, the skin
depth of the substrate increases, leading to an increase in eddy currents in the
substrate. Formation of the eddy currents results in a decrease of the Q-factor of the
inductor. Heavily doped substrates are usually used in a submicron process, with
substrate resistivity usually lying in the range of 10–30 Ω cm and the performance
of spiral inductors is typically limited by the substrate. Inductors fabricated in
MEMS processes strive to minimize the effects of this limitation, as will be dis-
cussed later. The third factor has already been explained and has an effect close to
resonance. The graphical analysis of factors F1, F2 and F3 for a 1 nH spiral
inductors optimized at different low-gigahertz frequencies for the highest quality
operation is shown in Fig. 4.32.

As mentioned before, close to resonant frequency, the frequency has some effect
on the apparent inductance value, which can be calculated from
Leff ¼ ImðZÞ

where Z is the total impedance of the single-p-modeled inductor with its one port

4.5.5.4
Higher-Order Spiral Inductor Models
A somewhat more complex model is the segmented model presented in [34]. Each
segment of the inductor is modeled separately with a circuit shown in Fig. 4.33.
Note that in this model, unlike in the single-p model, parasitics Cox, Csub and Rsub
represent parasitics of only one inductor segment, LS and RS represent the induc-
tance and parasitic capacitance of one segment coupled to all segments. In addition,
capacitances Cf1 and Cf2 represent coupling to adjacent segment nodes.

The standard single-p model can also be extended into a second-order, dis-
tributed double-p model [25, 35]. A second-order ladder with a third grounded
branch is used to model the distributive characteristics of metal windings, as
illustrated in Fig. 4.34. The interwinding capacitance Cw models the capacitive
effects between metal windings of the inductor, and the transformer loops MS1 and
MS2 represent the effects of frequency-dependent series loss.
The second-order model is valid for the inductor up to the ﬁrst resonance fre-
quency. A third-order model, such as the one shown in Fig. 4.35 [36], allows for
predicting the inductor behavior accurately, even beyond the resonant frequency.
Coupling of adjacent inductors changes the inductance value and the quality
factor of the inductor. This means that often it is insufﬁcient to look at modeling of
an inductor in isolation; coupling to nearby inductors needs to be investigated as
well. A model that takes coupling into consideration, veriﬁed for frequencies up to
millimeter-wave, has been described in [37]. However, since the inductors are very
sensitive to any adjacent circuitry (not just adjacent inductors), their layouts need to
be designed with some good layout practices in mind. These practices can assist in

reducing parasitics, eddy current losses and undesired coupling, as well increasing
the desired magnetic coupling. Adhering to these practices allows for fairly
high-quality inductors to be designed, irrespective of the geometry of the inductor
and its model. These include placing inductors on the highest possible metal layers
(which are incidentally, thick metal layers, thereby minimizing the resistive losses),
using parallel metal layers for the body of the inductor to reduce the sheet resis-
tance, placing unconnected metals far away from inductors, avoiding exceptionally
wide or narrow turn widths, using the narrowest turn spacing allowed, avoiding
smaller inner turns and avoiding placement of any unrelated circuitry, metal plates
and junctions close to or beneath the inductor spiral, and placing ground planes. An
extensive study of these techniques was done in [38].
4.5.6
Micro-Electro-Mechanical System Inductors
MEMS refers to a number of integrated fabrication techniques used to create cir-
cuits that expand into a third dimension, where traditional circuits are typically
considered two-dimensional. MEMS is considered extremely popular in inductor
fabrication, where various approaches are used to reduce the inﬂuence of substrate
parasitics. The main drawback of MEMS is the fact that processing steps are
changed (new processing steps are added), which inevitably adds to the cost of the
wafer, and ultimately, of the complete IC.
Parasitics are normally reduced by removing silicon directly under the inductor
structure. Techniques including bulk and surface micromachining effectively
replace silicon below the inductor by air or another material that has lower relative
permittivity, which allows the Q-factor and resonant frequency to approach the
values of off-chip inductors. Typical obtainable Q-factors range from 10 to 30 for a
1 nH inductors at the frequency of the resonance of the inductor. An example of a
high-Q silicon-based inductor using polymer cavity can be found in [39]. This
inductor achieves a Q-factor of 38 for a 1.61 nH inductor around 10 GHz.
An example of a high-Q micromachined inductor can be found in [40]. This
inductor achieves a Q-factor of 50 for 4 nH inductor at 5 GHz. The photograph in
Fig. 4.36 illustrates the substrate removal at the corner of this robust inductor.
Solenoidal inductors suspended on-chip are another variety of MEMS inductors
[41]. Advantages over conventional spiral inductors include a lower stray capaci-
tance because only part of the inductor is lying on the silicon substrate, possibilities
for ﬂexible layout and a deterministic design equation. Advanced micromachining
techniques for solenoidal inductors have been introduced, including 3-D laser
lithography, multiple-trenched sidewalls, the U-shaped solenoidal shape and a
concave-suspending MEMS process. An example of a solenoid inductor can be
found in [42], where the authors demonstrate forming of wires by on-demand
three-dimensional printing of nanoparticle laden droplets of known droplet size,
deposition frequency and evaporation time. The photograph of this inductor is
reproduced in Fig. 4.37.

Out-of-plane inductor [43] coils are fabricated using stress-engineered thin ﬁlms.
The stress gradient is induced by changing the ambient pressure during ﬁlm
deposition. When ﬁlm is released it tends to curl up in a circular trajectory. This
effect is illustrated in Fig. 4.38. The typical Q-factor of this conﬁguration is over 70
at 1 GHz.
4.5.7
Transmission-Line Inductors
Similar to the case of capacitors, open- and short-circuited stubs can be used to
make inductors. Reverting to Eqs. (4.34) and (4.35), lengths of transmission line in
terms of wavelength can be found for inductive behavior. Short-circuited stubs will
be inductive for lengths lower than k/4 and open-circuited stubs are inductive for
lengths between k/4 and k/2 [10]. Since both inductors and capacitors are built from
the same stubs, a capacitor can be turned into an inductor and vice versa by simply
changing the termination of the line without the need to change the length of the
line
Stubs, however, are mostly useful for matching and in the case of LNA, series
inductive transmission-line segments may be more appealing. An inductive trans-
mission line is modeled as an inductor in series with a resistor [40]. Inductance and

literature.

Two-dimensional and three-dimensional meanders are discussed in [44].
A two-dimensional meander is a ﬂat passive inductor consisting of a long piece of
metal that is not wound as in the case of the spiral inductor, but rather meanders
similarly to rivers in their lower watercourses. The main advantages of this type of
inductor are its small footprint and the fact that no underpass is required. Its
measured Q-factor, however, is quite low (about 2.1 for inductance of 1.3 nH).
Such a trade-off between the area and Q-factor is acceptable for matching network
applications.
The second type of meander is a snake inductor that meanders into the third
dimension. Both of these inductors are shown in Fig. 4.39. The inductance of a
meander inductor can also be calculated using a data-ﬁtted monomial expression,
similar to that of the spiral inductor introduced earlier.
Electrically tunable solenoidal on-chip inductors are discussed in [45]. Other
tunable inductors are commonly implemented in active conﬁguration, such as in the
case of the inductor in [46].
Toroid inductors can also be implemented on chip by means of micromachining
[47].
4.5.9
RF Chokes
RFCs are large-value inductors that are used to suppress AC signals while passing
the DC signal. The AC signal would be suppressed in full if the inductor had been
inﬁnitely large; however, in practice, this is unreachable. An RFC is normally
designed with a ﬁnite value for an acceptable amount of ripple. Since the induc-
tance of the RFC need not be carefully controlled, the additional reactance of the
tracks and bond wires is not a cause for concern.
RFCs are typically manufactured in the form of toroidal inductors with ferrite
cores, because of their high inductance index. Alternatively, the quarter-wave
transformer, described earlier in this chapter, also behaves as RFC [10].

4.6
Transformers and Baluns
A transformer transfers energy between two or more circuits using the principle of
electromagnetic induction. Transformers used with LNAs typically serve to connect
a balanced and an unbalanced source and load and are called baluns [48], or
alternatively, they serve in matching networks [49]. An example of where a balun
may become necessary is when connecting a differential LNA to an antenna that is
single-ended [50]. A transformer is essentially two or more inductors either placed
closely together or interleaved. The two inductors are called primary and secondary
windings. The schematics of a balun and an n:1 (4:1) transformer are shown in
Fig. 4.40. An n:1 transformer can also be built using coils with a different number
of turns between the primary and the secondary winding.
A typical integrated transformer conﬁguration uses spiral inductors described
earlier. The two most common types of transformers are shown in Fig. 4.41.
An important parameter in transformer design is the coupling coefﬁcient k be-
tween the primary and secondary winding. The mutual inductance M that appears
between the primary and secondary winding is
M ¼ k
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
LpLs
p
;
ð4:67Þ
where Lp and Ls are inductances of the primary and the secondary winding
respectively. The mutual inductance is essentially split and effectively added to both
the primary and secondary winding. This effect allows transformers to be used with
LNAs as well, with an additional beneﬁt. Designs that would otherwise deploy two
or more inductors can use smaller transformer primary and secondary windings
instead of two larger far-spaced inductors. Since the primary and secondary
windings can be laid on top of each other, area savings of more than 50% can
additionally be accomplished. At millimeter-wave frequencies, however, it is dif-
ﬁcult to achieve high coupling coefﬁcient values [51].

In addition to coupled coils, baluns can also be implemented using transmission
lines. Two popular implementations are the rat race balun [52] and the Marchand
balun [53]. The rat race balun is actually a coupler with a length of 1.5k with four
ports placed one quarter wavelength away from one another on one half of the ring,
as illustrated in Fig. 4.42a. The remaining half of the ring has no ports and is a
three-quarter wavelength in length. The Marchand balun is built from two
quarter-wave transformers, as illustrated in Fig. 4.42b, where the transmission lines
are illustrated as coaxial lines.

Concluding Remarks
In this chapter, an extensive discussion on passives typically used with LNAs was
held. Resistors, capacitors, inductors and transmission lines were all discussed,
from the viewpoint of both integrated and discrete implementations. Models for
different component types were given in some detail. The importance of parasitics
with increased frequency was discussed; it was noted that the inductor is typically
the passive that suffers the largest losses even at millimeter-wave frequencies. In
this chapter the Q-factor, an important quantity for describing passives, was also
deﬁned.
At the end of this chapter, the discussion on the active and passive components
as well as on the active and passive processes (or substrates) comes to a close.
Research reported in Chaps. 3 and 4, together with the research in Chap. 2, how-
ever, allows for the focus shift of Part I of this book towards LNA topologies,
which starts in Chap. 5.

Chapter 5
General Low-Noise Ampliﬁers
Abstract In this chapter the theory and mathematics of general LNAs are
explored. This is the ﬁrst chapter in which practical LNA conﬁgurations are
explored in detail, whereas previous chapters served as a build-up towards this
chapter, describing the background of millimeter-wave research, ampliﬁer design,
semiconductor technologies and active and passive devices. This chapter opens
with a short discussion on the research, design and development considerations for
millimeter-wave applications, mostly as a summary of the research from previous
chapters. In the rest of the chapter, some of the most popular LNA topologies are
introduced, described and compared against one another. Single-ended and differ-
ential conﬁgurations are treated separately because of their fundamental differences.
Speciﬁc challenges associated with millimeter-wave design for different topologies
are discussed in more detail as the chapter progresses.
In this chapter, the theory and mathematics of general LNAs will be explored. This
is the ﬁrst chapter in which practical LNA conﬁgurations will be explored in detail,
whereas previous chapters of Part I, viz. Chaps. 2–4, served as a build-up towards
this chapter, describing the background of millimeter-wave research, ampliﬁer
design, semiconductor technologies and active and passive devices. Active and
passive devices were shown to be the most important building blocks of every
LNA, a fact that was also elaborated on in Chap. 1. Going back to Chap. 1, this
chapter served as the introduction to the ﬁeld of research of LNAs and how they ﬁt
into the complete receiver and transceiver system. The main objectives of a good
LNA were given, namely that it should provide good input matching, low return
loss, a low noise ﬁgure, high gain, low power consumption and good linearity. This
chapter also introduced the general model of the LNA (Fig. 1.9) and showed (but
did not described) two practical LNA conﬁgurations (cascode in Fig. 1.10 and
shunt-series feedback ampliﬁer in Fig. 1.11). Of course, as with every electronic
circuit, there are many possible conﬁgurations, each with its beneﬁts and draw-
backs, and therefore Chap. 5 will attempt to cover at least some of the most popular
LNA conﬁgurations, while presenting the theory and mathematics of these con-
ﬁgurations. Where possible, this chapter will try to differentiate between

narrowband and broadband LNAs and to focus on narrowband conﬁgurations only,
whereas the discussion of the increasingly popular wideband conﬁgurations will be
deferred until Chap. 6. Although wideband implementations have a great advantage
in the reusability of the same circuit in multiple frequency bands, narrowband
implementations, among others, ﬁnd their use in applications where narrowband
operation is required in order to reduce interference from adjacent channels.

narrowband conﬁgurations require some kind of tunability.
Since the focus of this book remains on the millimeter-wave regime, this chapter
will open with a short discussion on the research, design and development con-
siderations for millimeter-wave applications, mostly as a summary of the research
from previous chapters. In the rest of the chapter, some of the most popular LNA

Single-ended and differential conﬁgurations will be treated separately because of
their fundamental differences. Speciﬁc challenges associated with millimeter-wave
design for different topologies will be discussed in more detail as the chapter
progresses.
5.1
Research, Design and Development Considerations
for Millimeter-Wave Applications
Important research, design and development considerations for millimeter-wave
applications were already treated earlier in this book, and this section will serve
merely as a reminder of these considerations and implications, although it will
allow for some important extensions.
In principle, the bulk of early research into LNAs has been directed at LNA
operation in the UHF and SHF frequency bands. The challenges that millimeter-wave
LNAs still faced in late 2000s and probably still face today are reminiscent of the
challenges that UHF and SHF LNAs faced in 1990s [1]. This is mostly related to the
inadequate speed and cost of transistors and transistor fabrication and the limited
performance of passive components. As shown, however, in the earlier chapters, new
technologies for transistor fabrication keep emerging, allowing for more practical
LNA conﬁgurations. The same is the case for passive components, but as tech-
nologies improve, designs are attempted at even higher frequencies, or close to the
transitional frequency of the transistor. It is thus often necessary to replace
lower-gaining single-stage ampliﬁer conﬁgurations by cascaded ampliﬁer conﬁgu-
rations consisting of several gain stages to reach desirable gains [2].
However, millimeter-wave research carries its own challenges despite the fact
that a huge number of millimeter-wave circuits have indeed been reported [3].
Device modeling, for example, is one of those challenges, where more complex
models are needed to predict ampliﬁer behavior. Model extraction, based on
152

General Low-Noise Ampliﬁers

on-wafer measurement for frequencies above 110 GHz, loses accuracy as well, and
researchers are often required to rely on models for lower-frequency operation [4].
Practical issues cannot be disregarded either; for example, a particular LNA can
have good performance in terms of gain and noise ﬁgure, but it may suffer from
poor electrostatic discharge (ESD) issues [5], and adding ESD protection might
decrease the noise performance of the ampliﬁer [6]. The cost of LNA fabrication is
not a problem anymore, seeing that millimeter-wave circuitry can nowadays be
placed on inexpensive technologies such as silicon CMOS or SiGe BiCMOS, as
opposed to more expensive technologies such as GaAs or other technologies dis-
cussed in Chap. 3, but the trade-off between simplicity and circuit performance
remains [3].
A general LNA must perform well despite process, temperature or voltage
variations, but it becomes increasingly difﬁcult to achieve these goals as frequencies
increase. This is because deep submicron devices, capable of millimeter-wave
operation, are typically more prone to process variations [3]. It may also be more
challenging to achieve stability of millimeter-wave ampliﬁers, particularly in a
design with multiple stages [7]. Furthermore, the typical operation of these circuits
is at poorly controlled low-voltage supplies. Choice of passives, and more pre-
cisely, inductors, remains a challenge, and the decision needs to be made only after
considering the size, layout requirements and electrical performance of each
structure. Spiral inductors could offer area saving, but may not have routing ﬂex-
ibility. On the other hand, a properly implemented transmission line may have the
advantage of faster design or better quality factors. It may be possible to use more
than one type of passive implementation in the same design; for example, the same
LNA could utilize transmission lines for interstage matching and bond wires for
source degeneration [8]. The choice of the latter may be determined by the fact that
carefully controlled inductance is not required for a speciﬁc component. More
attention needs to be paid to the layout of various components, to reduce inter-
ference and improve efﬁciency [9]. Experimentation has also shown that as the
quality factor of an inductor increases, the noise ﬁgure of an LNA becomes almost
independent of the quality factor of inductors used [10]. This fact can be used as an
advantage in inductor design where ﬁnding the optimum inductor size could save
device area and therefore cost.
5.2
Single-Ended Low-Noise Ampliﬁers
Single-ended LNAs are the simplest LNA conﬁgurations. As shown in Chap. 1, a
single-ended LNA can be built by deploying only one transistor, as in the case of a
common-source or common-emitter LNA, or two or more transistors can be used,
as in the case of cascode topology. The number of passive components also differs,
depending on the topology. Passives can be used for input and output impedance
matching, source or emitter degeneration or feedback.
This section opens with a discussion of the most popular LNA topologies.

Some popular LNA topologies are shown in Fig. 5.1 [3, 11–14]. Figure 5.1a–c are
the basic conﬁgurations, and all the other LNA can be built or expanded by
modifying either of the three basic conﬁgurations. Of course, as before, MOSFET

in the circuit diagram can be replaced with any other active device discussed in
Chap. 3, for example an HBT. All the topologies closely resemble the standard
low-frequency ampliﬁers, except for the addition of the drain inductor or the RFC
connected to the supply voltage in all ﬁgures but Fig. 5.1i, j, as well as the series
inductor in the incoming signal path in all ﬁgures except Fig. 5.1i. This inductor is
typically needed to resonate out the parasitic capacitances of the driving transistor.
The gain of the LNA in each case is set so that the LNA noise ﬁgure dominates the
noise of the cascaded system (the effect that was investigated in Chap. 2 already).
Figure 5.1d–h deploy a source-degeneration inductor. This inductor establishes
series-series feedback; it is typically added to improve ampliﬁer stability and lin-
earity with no noise added (assuming lossless load) and aids in matching, as will be
seen later. LNAs in Fig. 5.1f, g are feedback ampliﬁers. Figure 5.1i is another
feedback ampliﬁer, the resistive feedback LNA, which is similar to LNAs in
Fig. 5.1f, g, with the exception that inductors are avoided to achieve a small die
area [15, 16]. The feedback in general is added to increase the bandwidth of the
ampliﬁer, or more precisely, GBP. Feedback ampliﬁers will therefore rather be
covered in Chap. 6. Figure 5.1h is the folded cascode LNA, which is preferred for
low-voltage operation, which comes at the expense having to include more passive
components than the classic cascode conﬁguration. Finally, Fig. 5.1j is the LC-
ladder LNA, where the LC-ladder at the input is done to increase the bandwidth by
an arbitrary amount [14].
All the conﬁgurations can be expanded with the addition of tuning circuits to aid
the matching and harmonic termination.
It is often necessary to design LNAs as multi-stage ampliﬁers, either because the
required gain cannot be reached or in cases when high gains compromise linearity.

In those cases, interstage matching also becomes important, as illustrated in
Fig. 5.2. The output matching of the LNA should also not be disregarded [17]. This
can be achieved either by lumped components or transmission lines, or even using
integrated transformers [18]. Depending on the number of stages, matching net-
works can include low-pass ﬁltering, bandpass ﬁltering or high-pass ﬁltering. An
example of multi-stage LNA is shown in Fig. 5.3 [19]. For a typical LNA gain of
about 20 dB, two or three stages may be required [20].
The comparison of the three fundamental conﬁgurations in terms of basic LNA
parameters: noise ﬁgure, gain, linearity, bandwidth, stability, required supply
voltage, reverse isolation and sensitivity to process, component and supply varia-
tions is shown in Table 5.1 (expanded from Grebennikov et al. [11]). From this
analysis, the cascode LNA is clearly the conﬁguration with the prospect of best
performance. Other than high stability and good reverse isolation (meaning that the
local oscillator signal is not mixed back into the antenna), the overall gain of the
ampliﬁer is increased by virtue of increasing the output impedance [12]. Of course,
as expected, the synergy of optimum operation is achieved, among others, with
proper sizing and biasing of the transistor, irrespective of the topology.
A common-source (common-emitter) LNA is also a good choice, but the
common-gate LNA suffers from a noise ﬁgure that increases with frequency. On the
other hand, it requires lower supply voltages while resembling the lowest noise
ﬁgure, and is beneﬁcial in circuits with stringent constraints on these two param-
eters, although more stages may be required to reach a gain ﬁgure than would be the
case if the cascode conﬁguration was used. Lastly, common-gate (common-base)

have
a
distinct
advantage
over
cascode
and
common-source
(common-emitter) conﬁgurations, which is that the input impedance of the ampli-
ﬁer can easily be set to 50 X, the importance of which will be seen as this chapter
progresses.
As transistor size increases, a better noise ﬁgure and gain can be achieved,
although these come at the expense of linearity [21]. When working with bipolar
transistors (HBTs), sizing typically refers to emitter length (or area), which is
characteristically the only parameter than can be controlled (in addition to bias), and
the size of a MOSFET is adjusted by adjusting the W/L ratio. Also, the biasing
greatly inﬂuences the noise ﬁgure. The value of the minimum achievable noise
ﬁgure changes with bias and for a typical modern SiGe HBT cascode LNA, it
changes as illustrated in Fig. 5.4, showing that the optimum bias point for the
forward-active operation is when the base voltage VB is between 0.8 and 0.9 V.
5.2.2
The Cascode Topology
The cascode conﬁguration is appealing for LNA design for at least one reason
additional to those listed in Table 5.1, viz. the decreased Miller capacitance.
A smaller Miller capacitance makes it more attractive for higher frequency oper-
ation [21], the effect that will be described mathematically later.
Cascode LNA without feedback or shunt input passive components can only be
matched to a 50 X resistance over a small frequency of interest, making the
ampliﬁer narrowband [22]. To ensure that the ampliﬁer operates at the correct
frequency though, the inductor Ld can be replaced with a resonant tank tuned to the

frequency of interest, as illustrated in Fig. 5.5. In principle, some tunability can be
added to the resonant tank, for example by replacing the capacitor with a MOSFET
varactor [23].
5.2.3
Modeling and Equations of the Cascode
Conﬁguration
Analysis of the cascode LNA can be initiated by looking at the low-frequency
cascode MOSFET equivalent, such as the one shown in Fig. 5.6 [24], where the
circuit is broken into a common-source block (transistor M1) and a common-gate
block (transistor M2), for clarity. The small-signal model of this ampliﬁer then

assumes the schematic shown in Fig. 5.7, if the body effect is assumed to be
negligible and Cgs1 and Cgs2 are the only capacitors that are included. Feedback
capacitors Cgd1 and Cgd2, however small, can be completely removed from the
model by recalling that the Miller effect is less prominent in the cascode conﬁgu-
ration. The bipolar cascode small-signal diagram then looks very similar, with the
exception of the addition of resistances rp1 and rp2, which must be included in
parallel to Cgs1(Cp1) and Cgs2(Cp2) respectively, with Cl1 and Cl2 similarly
ignored.
A well-known fact of the MOSFET cascode is that the low-frequency input
impedance is equal to the input impedance of the common-source conﬁguration,
which is inﬁnite:

It can be shown by analyzing the small-signal model that the gain of the cascode
is
Gm ¼ gm1

!
;
ð5:3Þ
which can be simpliﬁed to approximately
Gm ¼ gm1;
ð5:4Þ
because gm2ro1 is typically much greater than 1. The important conclusion that can
be reached by analyzing Eqs. (5.1)–(5.4), is that the input impedance and gain of
the cascode conﬁguration are determined by the transconductance and input
impedance of the ﬁrst transistor (transistor M1). Once this circuit is moved to the RF
frequencies, and matching is required, this also means that only the ﬁrst transistor is
going to determine the matching conditions.
For the sake of completion, the output resistance of the cascode is
Ro ¼ ro1 þ ro2 þ gm2ro1ro2  gm2ro1ro2;
ð5:5Þ
which is one order of Early voltage higher than the output of the common-source
ampliﬁer, which demonstrates the previously discussed increase in the output
impedance of the cascode when compared with other LNA conﬁgurations.
At this stage, to turn the low-frequency cascode into an LNA, one can revert to
the circuit shown in Fig. 5.5. As mentioned above, the moment the operation is
translated into the RF or millimeter-wave domain, matching becomes important.
This is even more true when LNAs are concerned, where attention needs to be paid
to accomplish simultaneous noise ﬁgure and impedance match. The task of
designing an LNA is then practically turned into an input matching exercise.
Linearity, output matching, interstage matching and other concerns are excluded in
the meantime. Ideally, the gain of the LNA should be included in the analysis that
follows, but with the assumption that if it is sufﬁciently large so that the noise ﬁgure
of the LNA dominates the noise ﬁgure of the complete system, it can be omitted.
The minimum achievable noise ﬁgure for particular biasing and, therefore ampliﬁer
gain, will be ﬁxed at the value

for the MOS transistor; the particulars of this equation were already discussed in
Chap. 3 (where a similar equation for the bipolar transistor was presented as well).
Input of the LNA can then be matched by looking at the input impedance and noise
ﬁgure equations alone, and gain can be calculated or S-parameters (S21) can be
analyzed.

General Low-Noise Ampliﬁers

At RF, the input impedance of a MOSFET needs to include the capacitor Cgs:
Zi ¼
1
jxCgs1
;
ð5:7Þ
where x is the frequency of operation. The situation is somewhat more complex for
the bipolar transistor, there the capacitor Cp1 appears in parallel to rp1, that is
Zi ¼
1
jxCp1
jjrp1
ð5:8Þ
The impedance 1/jxCp1 increases with frequency, and at a certain frequency it
will start dominating in Eq. (5.8). It can be shown that this happens if f >> fb, or
rather if x >> xb. This is an important consequence allowing LNAs deploying
MOSFETs and LNAs deploying bipolar transistors to be treated in the same way.
From Chap. 2, the noise ﬁgure of an LNA can be expressed as
F ¼ Fmin þ Rn
Gs
jYs  Yoptj2;
ð5:9Þ
which means that the minimum noise ﬁgure is achieved when the LNA input
impedance is matched to Ys = Ys,opt. The input impedance given by Eqs. (5.7) or
(5.8) typically differs from Zopt = 1/Yopt, therefore impedances Zopt and Zin must be
modiﬁed to meet at one point of the Smith chart. This concept is illustrated in
Fig. 5.8.

With a proper receiving antenna, the source resistance would ideally be 50 X,
allowing for the impedances to meet at the origin of the Smith chart (assuming that
the Smith chart impedances are normalized to 50 X) and simplifying the matching
conditions somewhat. One way of reaching the required Zi = Zopt = Z0 = 50 X
input impedance would be to place a shunt 50 X resistor at the gate or the base of
the transistor, which would introduce an unnecessary increase in the noise ﬁgure
due to the noise of the resistor (this is where the common-gate ampliﬁer with its low
input impedance has found its advantage). However, source degeneration by means
of an inductor allows for an alternative approach. With inductor Ls included, the
small-signal diagram of M1 changes to the circuit depicted in Fig. 5.9a, and after
transformations, a resistance of value (gm1/Cgs1)Ls appears in the model (Fig. 5.9b)
[13, 25]. The presence of this resistance is not obvious, but it can be proven if the
analysis of the small-signal model described below is carried out. First, it is noted
that a voltage drop v1 appears across capacitor Cgs1, thus the AC gate current ig is

where the fact that xT = gm/Cgs when Cgd is ignored is used to introduce the
transitional frequency of the transistor into the equation. For the match to the
characteristic impedance Z0 = 50 X, Zi once more needs to be set to 50 X, which is
a real value. This can be accomplished by removing the imaginary part of
Eq. (5.15) and keeping the real part. This means that the sum Lg + Ls needs to
resonate Cgs1 out at the speciﬁc frequency of operation and for speciﬁc bias con-
ditions. The fact that Ls alone cannot resonate the Cgs1 out explains why an addi-
tional gate inductor, Lg, was included from the beginning.
The imaginary part, of course, will only be resonated out at a small frequency
band, and therefore this technique is only applicable to narrowband ampliﬁers, but
it can be extended to wideband ampliﬁers, as will be seen in Chap. 6. Since Cgs1 is
ﬁxed, both Ls and Lg will attain ﬁxed values:

The result of Eq. (5.17) is because of resonance.
Note that with inductive source degeneration, the transconductance of the cas-
code stage decreases and becomes independent of gm1, similar to what is seen in
resistor-degenerated low-frequency transistor ampliﬁers. The new transconductance
is now

and is clearly set by the matching impedance value.
Equation (5.16) shows that the higher the fT of the transistor is, the lower the
inductance value that will be needed for matching [12], which is an important
aspect knowing that inductors tend to occupy signiﬁcant chip real estate.

Note that the above analysis of the cascode LNA conﬁrms that the unique design
solution of an LNA can be found in a speciﬁed technology for the speciﬁc value of
gm1 (computed from biasing and transistor sizing) and Cgs1 (dependent on transistor
sizing). This may not be an optimal solution (e.g. solution yielding the minimum
noise ﬁgure), since other values of gm1 and Cgs1 could offer a better solution.
The problem, however, with the analysis above is that the small-signal model of
the transistor feedback capacitance Cgd (or Cl, in the case of bipolar transistors) has
been ignored. Although it has been stated that the cascode conﬁguration suffers
much less from the Miller multiplication effect than the normal common-source
conﬁguration, however small the multiplication effect, it could become a problem as
frequencies increase. Thus, this analysis needs to be reconsidered with Cgd1 and
Cgd2 included. First, the effect of the feedback capacitor on the common-source
ampliﬁer will be analyzed. Recall, from Chap. 3, that the high-frequency
small-signal model of the MOSFET looks like that depicted in Fig. 5.10. With v1
and vo labeled as in the ﬁgure, the AC current through capacitor Cgd will be [24]

has been used. Equation (5.24) indicates that the feedback capacitor Cgd can be
replaced by a shunt capacitor of value CM at the input of the common-source
ampliﬁer, as illustrated in Fig. 5.11. In the common-source ampliﬁer, CM is typi-
cally much larger than Cgd because of the high ampliﬁer gain by design.
If the common-source conﬁguration is replaced by the cascode conﬁguration, as
shown in Fig. 5.12 (Fig. 5.9 repeated with Cgd1 and Cgd2 shown), the transistor M1
“sees” the low input impedance of the common-gate connected M2, (RM2) which
then replaces the ro1, which is much larger in Eq. (5.22). This results in a low
voltage gain of transistor M1 and therefore the Miller multiplication effect is low.
Moreover, for the inductively degenerated M1, its gain can be expressed as [26]

The consequence of Eq. (5.28) is that it is progressively much more challenging
to match the input impedance Zin to Zopt = Ropt (still typically 50 X) as the Miller
effect becomes more prominent, which will typically happen at millimeter-wave
frequencies (even in the Ka-band), even for cascode conﬁgurations. The matching
of impedances becomes a more complicated function of the transconductance
parameter and transistor sizing than when the Miller effect is ignored, through the
added effect of CM and Cgd1. Since transistor sizing and bias already inﬂuence the
minimum noise ﬁgure, in this case the analytical solution for simultaneous power
and noise matching becomes too complex to do by hand. The best approach in this
case is to minimize the magnitude of the input return loss Coptin, where

by sweeping for various values of Ls, for ﬁxed bias and transistor size values, as
illustrated in Fig. 5.14. Again, an optimal solution may be available for different
bias settings and transistor sizes.
As seen above, the LNA modeling situation is complicated even further if

Furthermore, with MOS devices, body biasing can also have an effect on the noise

must be taken. In this approach, transistor sizing and drain or collector current can
be varied and contours of wanted parameters could be plotted to identify acceptable
regions of performance [11, 27]. Then the bias and sizing are tuned so that LNA
operates at the intersection of regions of acceptable performance, as illustrated in
Fig. 5.15 [27]. The optimum LNA solution will be somewhere inside of the
identiﬁed acceptable region.
This technique can be expanded further to wideband and/or feedback ampliﬁers
discussed in Chap. 6. The design can, however, be somewhat simpliﬁed if several
LNA stages can be used for ampliﬁcation, whereby each stage is responsible for
achieving only several of the required speciﬁcations. Thus in multi-stage ampliﬁers,
linearity is often the determining factor in the last stage (since the signal swing is
the largest), gain is typically the determining factor of the middle stage(s) [20], and,
as discussed before, noise is the determining factor of the ﬁrst stage.
5.2.4
Two-Port Parameters
As discussed in Chap. 2, the performance of an LNA, and therefore the cascode
LNA, is usually investigated by means of two-port S-parameters. Typically, the
input matching and the gain of the LNA are measured. Gain is represented by the
parameter S21, and input matching is shown by the parameter S11. The output
matching is sometimes also reported by reporting the S22 parameter. Reverse iso-
lation is described by parameter S12, graphical representation of which is typically
avoided in many papers. Typical shapes of the parameters S11, S21 and S22 for a
millimeter-wave narrowband design could look like those shown in Fig. 5.16. This
ﬁgure illustrates S-parameters of one of the state-of the-art LNAs described in
Chap. 7, but is reused here for illustration purposes.

5.2.5
Single-Ended Topologies for Millimeter-Wave
Application
In principle, the same LNA topologies that were listed in Fig. 5.1 can be used in
millimeter-wave applications, but the considerations listed at the beginning of this
chapter need to be honored for a successful design. A typical millimeter-wave LNA
will probably have more than one stage, where the ﬁrst stage would be optimized
for noise, and the second and the subsequent stage would be the gain stages. The
ﬁrst stage will most likely be a cascode stage. The interstage matching would be
performed with transmission line elements, and source degeneration, if required,
would be achieved either with high-quality spiral inductors or, once again, using
transmission lines.
One such millimeter-wave LNA conﬁguration is illustrated in Fig. 5.17 [28].
The bipolar ampliﬁer has two cascode stages, where the ﬁrst bipolar stage (Q1) is
degenerated with a transmission line, which allows for the input impedance to reach
50 X, when the transmission line at the input of Q1 is used to resonate the parasitics
of the transistor and the transistor is scaled and biased for optimum operation.
One alternative implementation is in CMOS, with spiral inductors as passive
components, as presented in [5]. The circuit depicted in Fig. 5.18 also deploys the
inductively degenerated cascode as the ﬁrst stage and features improved ESD
performance.
5.3
Differential Low-Noise Ampliﬁers
Alternatives to single-ended LNAs are differential LNAs, such as the cascode
differential LNA shown in Fig. 5.19 [11]. Although they have a clear disadvantage
of occupying more space than the single-ended conﬁgurations and requiring baluns

simulated gain curves (S21)

output losses (S11 and S22

to connect to antennas, there are some beneﬁts to this approach. If an LNA is
operated in a differential conﬁguration, a virtual ground node is created where the
left and right part of the cascode meet (the tail of the differential ampliﬁer). This is
useful in removal of, for example, package parasitics on the gate side of the input

transistors (for example, when a bond wire is unsuitable in the design) or parasitic
ground inductance [13]. This, however, means that no off-chip inductors can be
used in the design. The second beneﬁt comes from the fact that second-order
intermodulation terms are annulled by virtue of the differential operation
(common-mode rejection). The differential conﬁguration, however, still suffers
from third-order and higher odd-order intermodulation distortion. Further disad-
vantages are a decreased noise performance and increased power consumption.
Another beneﬁt of using differential ampliﬁers involves wideband ampliﬁers. As
seen in Chap. 2, the differential conﬁguration acts as an fT doubler, allowing wider
frequency operation. Differential ampliﬁers are also appealing when realizing
inductorless LNA conﬁgurations, such as the feedback inductorless conﬁguration
shown in Fig. 5.20 [29], where the beneﬁts of the differential conﬁguration allow
for high linearity.

Concluding Remarks
In this chapter, LNA theory was introduced. It was seen that although numerous
LNA conﬁgurations exist, most are built from a few basic topologies, with the
cascode topology offering a unique set of beneﬁts. The chapter looked at both
single-ended and differential conﬁgurations. It was shown that most topologies
could be conﬁgured for either narrowband or broadband operation, where the
broadband operation typically uses some form of series feedback or requires
additional circuitry for implementation. Most of this chapter focused on the
description and mathematics of narrowband LNAs, and more speciﬁcally, the
popular cascode conﬁguration, with numerous examples of other popular tech-
nologies. Analytical design methodologies with varying degrees of accuracy were
given, and where an analytical solution became too complex to be carried out by
hand, the graphical solution was suggested. Although most of the theory treated in
this chapter is applicable to all LNAs irrespective of the regime of operation (RF,
microwave of millimeter wave), unique challenges with millimeter wave were dealt
with throughout this chapter.
A detailed discussion on wideband LNAs and challenges for wideband LNA
analysis and design, particularly if the wideband operation is translated from RF to
millimeter-wave frequencies, because of the extent of the topic, will be presented in
Chap. 6, which, together with this chapter forms a two-chapter block on LNA
theory.

Chapter 6
Broadband Low-Noise Ampliﬁers
Abstract Although some conﬁgurations were already mentioned in Chap. 5
(mostly, feedback conﬁgurations), the techniques to turn narrowband LNAs into
broadband LNAs are the topic of this chapter. The chapter opens with a discussion of
some popular RF broadband topologies, their general circuit diagrams and their
advantages and disadvantages. Where applicable, a mathematical explanation of the
circuit operation are given, before extending the circuit operation into the
millimeter-wave domain with its unique challenges (which were already discussed in
Chap. 5 and are still applicable). Broadband matching techniques are also discussed.
Finally, the chapter ends with some more examples of broadband topologies.
In the previous chapter, general LNAs were described. It was seen that there are
several LNA conﬁgurations, which are mostly based on traditional low-frequency
common-source (common-emitter) or cascode transistor ampliﬁers, with some
additional circuitry to ensure good input matching, predominantly for noise, but
also for power. With the addition of some lumped elements (typically, two
inductors, one for inductive degeneration of the source or the emitter and the second
in series with the gate, used to resonate the parasitics out), very simple yet efﬁcient
narrowband conﬁgurations can be obtained. The remainder of the chapter then dealt
with narrowband LNA conﬁgurations, the mathematics of their operation and ways
to extend the operation into the millimeter-wave domain.
However, it was seen that broadband conﬁgurations are often preferred over
narrowband ampliﬁers because of the ability to work in multiple frequency bands
simultaneously, thus increasing circuit reusability. This typically comes at the
expense of a decreased noise ﬁgure. To achieve wideband operation, additional
circuitry is required. Typically, this means that additional lumped components need
to be added to modify the input matching of the ampliﬁer to support wideband
operation, feedback components need to be added to widen the operable frequency
range, or the narrowband ampliﬁer needs to be replaced with its wideband coun-
terpart, the cascaded ampliﬁer. Sometimes, the wideband LNA is preceded by a
separate bandpass ﬁlter to select a particular signal from the wide frequency range

covered by the LNA [1]. The bandpass ﬁlter should ideally have a small size, a high
Q-factor, low insertion loss, good selectivity and high stopband rejection.
Although some conﬁgurations were already mentioned in Chap. 5 (mostly,
feedback conﬁgurations), the techniques to turn narrowband LNAs into broadband
LNAs will be the topic of this chapter. The chapter will open with a discussion of
some popular RF broadband topologies, their general circuit diagrams and their
advantages and disadvantages. Where applicable, a mathematical explanation of the
circuit operation will be given, before extending the circuit operation into the
millimeter-wave domain with its unique challenges (which were already discussed
in Chap. 5 and are still applicable). Broadband matching techniques will also be
discussed. Finally, this chapter will end with some more examples of broadband
topologies.
6.1
Popular Broadband Topologies
Generally, popular broadband LNAs are classiﬁed into three large ampliﬁer groups.
The ﬁrst group comprises the traditional lumped conﬁgurations, such as
common-source or cascode LNAs, extended for wideband operation by the addition
of additional lumped components to ensure wideband input matching. In these
conﬁgurations, feedback is avoided, although, in the strict sense, adding inductive
source degeneration is also regarded as feedback.
The second group includes actual feedback conﬁgurations. Typically, resistive
feedback is used (in combination with other lumped circuitry), although it is pos-
sible to use other types of feedback as well. Finally, the cascaded ampliﬁers are the
third group of broadband LANs, where transmission lines are used to connect
various ampliﬁcation stages (for example, cascode LNAs) and provide broadband
matching.
It is often difﬁcult to classify ampliﬁers in these groups, for example in the case
where transmission lines are used as feedback or in multi-stage designs imple-
mented using lumped components. Nevertheless, this and several following sec-
tions will attempt making this differentiation.
6.1.1
Traditional Conﬁgurations: Common-Source
and Cascode Low-Noise Ampliﬁers
Traditional conﬁgurations, such as common-source and cascode LNA conﬁgura-
tions, can be extended to operate over wide bandwidth. Typically, an inductively
degenerated cascode conﬁguration, such as the one shown in Fig. 5.5, is used as a
starting point. Wideband cascode conﬁguration can simultaneously provide high
176

gain, decent reliability and a reasonable noise ﬁgure over a wide frequency range.
Typically, to achieve a lower noise contribution, a high-Q inductor should be used.
An example of a wideband cascode LNA is shown in Fig. 6.1a [2]. In this con-
ﬁguration, a reactive network consisting of an additional shunt inductor and a shunt
capacitor are added to resonate the input reactance of the common-source transistor
over a wide bandwidth. On the output side, the resonant tank seen in the previous
chapter in narrowband conﬁgurations is replaced with a shunt peaking resistor
(resistor and inductor in series), providing wideband matching on the output side.
The folded cascode can also be turned into a wideband ampliﬁer, in which case the
shunt peaking inductor is used only in the second stage of the folded cascode, as
illustrated in Fig. 6.1b.
Modeling and operation of the cascode conﬁguration will be discussed in more
detail in Sect. 6.2.1.

6.1.2
Feedback Conﬁgurations
Negative feedback in general ampliﬁer circuits is typically used to introduce ben-
eﬁts such as reduced sensitivity of gain to device parameter changes and to improve
linearity [3]. This comes at the expense of reduced ampliﬁer gain and stability.
However, with reduced gain, the bandwidth of the ampliﬁer also increases
(recalling the concept of the constant GBP). This effect is often used with LNA
circuits. With good wideband input and output matching, LNAs with a sufﬁciently
low-noise ﬁgure, ﬂat gain and small size can be achieved. Because of the lower gain
of a single ampliﬁer stage, feedback ampliﬁers are typically cascaded to increase the
gain [4]. In this case, interstage matching once again becomes important. A typical
general feedback ampliﬁer can be seen in Fig. 6.2, which can also be used as one of
the stages of a multistage feedback LNA. The modeling of this circuit will be
handled in Sect. 6.2.2.
As already mentioned, it is difﬁcult to classify an LNA purely as a feedback
ampliﬁer, as feedback is more often than not combined with matching, except,
perhaps, in some inductorless applications. This has allowed for a substantial
number of different feedback conﬁgurations, with other circuitry attached. One such
conﬁguration is the LNA with LC-ladder matching and capacitive shunt-shunt
feedback, illustrated in Fig. 6.3 [5]. In this conﬁguration, both the LC-ladder and
the feedback contribute to the wideband performance of the ampliﬁer, and although
the LC-ladder can be used without feedback and vice versa, some important design
constraints are removed if both effects are used together. This circuit will be
modeled in Sect. 6.2.3.
6.1.3
Cascaded Low-Noise Ampliﬁers
A typical cascaded ampliﬁer consists of cascaded LNA (typically cascode or
common-source) stages with wideband transmission-line matching. The cascaded

approach is taken when it is necessary to achieve high gain and low-noise ampli-
ﬁcation over a wide frequency range and when transmission line components can
be designed not to take up a large amount of chip real estate (making this ampliﬁer
once again a perfect candidate for millimeter-wave applications). The main
advantage is that the components used for matching are lossless. The performance
of this ampliﬁer is, however, limited by the active devices, which include the
maximum available gain and the fact that unconditional stability needs to be
achieved [4]. Thus, reaching very ﬂat gains over a wide frequency range is more of
a challenge than when attempting to work with, for example, feedback LNAs.
An example of a circuit diagram of a three-stage cascaded ampliﬁer is shown in
Fig. 6.4. The cascaded ampliﬁer will be discussed in more detail throughout this
chapter in the sections that deal with wideband matching and multi-stage
millimeter-wave LNAs.

6.2
Modeling and Equations
In this section, the modeling and mathematics of the cascode, resistive feedback and
LC-ladder LNA conﬁgurations introduced in the previous section are described.
6.2.1
Cascode Low-Noise Ampliﬁers
Recall from the discussions in Chap. 5 that the equivalent input impedance model
can be transformed to a circuit diagram shown in Fig. 5.9, and the input impedance
can be replaced by equation
Zi ¼
1
jxCgs1
þ jxLs þ xTLs;
ð6:1Þ
where xTLs is completely real, and could be replaced by a resistor R in the model to
simplify the mathematics further:
R ¼ xTLs:
ð6:2Þ
If an additional shunt LC section consisting of an inductor Lg and a capacitor Cg
is added in the incoming signal path to the circuit, as shown in Fig. 6.1, the
transformed small-signal model will look like the model illustrated in Fig. 6.5. As a
result, two ﬁlters, one in a low-pass conﬁguration and one in a high-pass conﬁg-
uration, are created, with cut off-frequencies of xL and xU respectively. Typically,
Ls is chosen for a matching impedance value of R = Z0, as was the case with the
narrowband ampliﬁer, except that this determined the center frequency in
the narrowband conﬁguration, and in the wideband conﬁguration, it determines the
lower frequency of the high-pass ﬁlter. Thus,

and
xL ¼

Cgs1R :
ð6:4Þ
This also allows for computation of the value of Lg:
Lg ¼ R
xL
:
ð6:5Þ
For the low-pass ﬁlter effect, the upper frequency is set by Ls:
xU ¼ R
Ls
;
ð6:6Þ
requiring the value of Cg of
Cg ¼ R
xU
:
ð6:7Þ
Note that in the previous analysis, the designer has very little control over the
bandwidth of the ampliﬁer, other than by resizing and biasing of the transistor to
control the value of Cgs.
On the output of the cascode ampliﬁer, wideband output matching also needs to
be achieved. In a typical cascode ampliﬁer (as in the case of any ampliﬁer), the
output capacitance of transistor M2 will introduce a pole in the output frequency
response, if the ampliﬁer is loaded with a resistive load. Thus, the resonant tank
often seen in narrowband LNA cascode conﬁgurations is replaced by a
resistor-inductor combination RL–LL. The series RL network introduces a zero in the
frequency response, canceling the effect of the RC network that appears due to
parasitics, which allows the output impedance to remain fairly constant over a wide
band of interest. When calculating the value of LL, it should be ensured that all the
capacitive loading is taken into consideration, that is, the output capacitance of the
ampliﬁer, node parasitics, or input capacitance of the following stage.
An alternative approach to input impedance wideband matching is to consider
the conﬁguration with the inductor placed in the series with the gate of the tran-
sistor, such as the narrowband conﬁguration seen in Fig. 5.5, with the resonant tank
replaced with the peaking resistor [6]. In this case, the same design approach as for
the narrowband ampliﬁer can be taken, except that the components Ls and Lg, as
well as the transistor sizing and biasing, are chosen such that the Q-factor is
sufﬁciently low to allow for wideband operation. The Q-factor in terms of the upper
and lower wideband 3-dB frequencies and the band center frequency is
6.2

Thus, after assuming that Re{Zin} >> Im{Zin}, the components can be chosen
from the Q-factor resonant tank equation

ð6:9Þ
where Q-factor in Eq. (6.9) is chosen as a value lower than required by Eq. (6.8),
Z0 = 50 X, and xTLs is chosen to be as close as possible to the generator resistance
Z0.
Note that the noise ﬁgure of the wideband cascode conﬁguration is higher than
the noise ﬁgure of its narrowband counterpart. This can be pointed out by rewriting
Eq. (5.19) in terms of the quality factor [2]:
F ¼ 1 þ rg

ð6:10Þ
It is clear that the noise ﬁgure increases with the decrease in the Q-factor, which
is one of the drawbacks of the cascode wideband ampliﬁer.
6.2.2
Resistive Feedback Conﬁguration
A typical feedback circuit is illustrated by means of a block diagram in Fig. 6.6. In
a feedback conﬁguration, the output voltage vo of the ampliﬁer with gain a(jx) is
fed back through additional circuitry with the transfer function f (not to be confused
with frequency) and subtracted from the input voltage vi [3]. The overall gain of this
ampliﬁer is
AðjxÞ ¼ vo
v1

ð6:11Þ
For the circuit of Fig. 6.2 the overall gain can be determined, using the
small-signal analysis, as [2]

ð6:12Þ
Thus, the gain decreases by a factor of 1 + RL/RF from the value of −gmRL seen
in the ampliﬁer without feedback. If the frequency response of the feedback
ampliﬁer is analyzed, it is seen that the decrease in gain by a factor of 1 + RL/RF
achieved by adding feedback also allows the pole in the frequency response of the
ampliﬁer without feedback to be shifted in the frequency domain of the ampliﬁer by
the same factor, as illustrated in Fig. 6.7. At the same time, the feedback resistor
becomes a determining factor in the input impedance as well, allowing the input
impedance to appear as a real quantity:
Zin ¼ RF þ RL
1 þ gmRL
 RF þ RL

:
ð6:13Þ
This removes the need for inductive source degeneration in an LNA design and
allows for real simultaneous impedance and power matching.
The noise ﬁgure of this conﬁguration, however, increases in response to the
noisy RF. The noise ﬁgure can be expressed as [4]

noise two-port conductance. In this equation, there is clearly an additional amount

LC-Ladder Low-Noise Ampliﬁers with Capacitive
Shunt-Shunt Feedback
The LC-ladder LNA with capacitive shunt-shunt feedback is based on the version of
the circuit without the shunt LC-ladder elements, as illustrated in Fig. 6.8 [5, 7]. An
interesting property of the conﬁguration without the LC-ladder is that the input
impedance of this conﬁguration can be set to a real source impedance (typically 50
X) without inductive source degeneration. This means that this conﬁguration only
requires one inductor for its implementation, almost factor-of-two improvement in
area over the cascode conﬁguration. If the small-signal analysis is performed similar
to what has been done in previous chapters, it can be seen that the input impedance
is
Zin ¼ Rin þ

(the effect of which is clearly negligible in the resistance equation), and the rest of
the components are shown in Fig. 6.8. Note that CF absorbs the parasitic capaci-
tance Cgd.
184

Broadband Low-Noise Ampliﬁers

The input capacitance, on the other hand, is highly dependent on Miller
capacitance. Cin is
Cin ¼ Cgs þ CM:
ð6:19Þ
To make Zin purely real then, inductor Lg needs to be chosen so that the last two
terms in Eq. (6.16) are equal (i.e. Cin is resonated out by Lg).
If the LC-ladder is added back to this circuit (Fig. 6.3), the wideband matching
can be carefully controlled at the expense of the addition of another inductor,
contrary to what was seen with the classic cascode ampliﬁer. In the classic cascode,
the values of Cgs and Cgd inﬂuence the bandwidth of the LNA even if the input
matching network is added, whereas the addition of the feedback capacitance
allows for the input capacitance of the ampliﬁer stage to be controlled directly by
this capacitance. The addition of the LC-ladder circuit requires an additional
inductor to be added to the circuit. Feedback also eliminates the need for the
common-gate transistor in series with the common-source transistor (i.e., the cas-
code), because the Miller effect in this case is desirable. With the ladder compo-
nents, the input impedance is now

The approach to removing this pole could be to add a second ampliﬁcation stage
with an inductor connected to the drain of the ampliﬁer, as illustrated in Fig. 6.9.
The inductor serves to introduce a pole in the frequency response of the complete
stage, thus ﬂattening the gain of the two-stage ampliﬁer. The gain of the second
stage is then
Av2 ¼ jxL2gm2;
ð6:23Þ
where L2 is another added inductor, and gm2 is the transconductance of the second
stage.
The noise ﬁgure of the two-stage LNA is determined by the noise ﬁgure of the
ﬁrst stage. The easiest way to analyze the noise ﬁgure is to revert to the small-signal
noise model of the MOSFET, presented in Chap. 3, and include the capacitive
feedback, such as illustrated in Fig. 6.10. With this done, the feedback capacitor
cannot be ignored anymore (as was done in Chap. 3 for Cgd), and this needs to be
incorporated when looking at equivalent generators. This results in the increase of
noise current according to the equation

Inductors typically used to implement inductors L1 and Lg have a substantial

R1 and Rg should also be included in the equivalent noise model. In addition, for the
calculation of the noise ﬁgure, the source resistance noise also needs to be included.

culation can be drawn, where v2

Two Port Parameters
In the case of wideband LNAs, the two port parameters need to show a ﬂat fre-
quency response. For example, the simulated S21 parameter of the LC-ladder
ampliﬁer reported in [7] shows between 15 and 20 dB gain over 11 GHz’s worth of
bandwidth between 3 and 14 GHz. At the same time, hand-modeling shows that
better performance is possible in theory, with the possibility of reaching a ﬁgure of
22 dB. Both plots are shown in Fig. 6.12.
6.4
Wideband Matching Techniques
The importance of matching was brought up already in Chap. 5 during the dis-
cussion of general LNAs. It was discussed that depending on the number of stages,
various approaches can be taken for input, output and interstage matching.
Throughout Chaps. 5 and 6 it was seen that input matching is most important,
because, in addition to determining the bandwidth, it also sets the noise ﬁgure.
Naturally, even one-stage LNA circuits require input matching, and the input
matching is designed to achieve bandpass performance, at least over the frequency
band of interest (which can be quite wide in wideband LNAs). Typically, this is
achieved using some of the wideband techniques described in this chapter, or,
where possible, acceptable regions of operation can be analyzed, as described in
Chap. 5 (Fig. 5.15).
The importance of the output matching grows in wideband conﬁgurations. In
narrowband LNAs, it only needs to be assured that performance parameters (such as
gain) are not lost due to output connections (for example, by using resonant tanks).
In wideband LNAs, as seen during the discussion of the wideband cascode

conﬁguration in Sect. 6.2.1 for example, the network needs to be designed such that
it at least matches the bandwidth of the input matching network. In the said cascode
conﬁguration, the peaked resistor can, for example, be used to remove the capac-
itive effect of the transistor.
With the addition of additional stages, the interstage matching gains importance
as well. During the discussion of the capacitive feedback conﬁgurations in
Sect. 6.2.3, for, example, it was seen that the second stage is needed to ﬂatten the
gain, because capacitive feedback introduces a low-pass response in the ampliﬁer.
In this and other conﬁgurations, stages need to be connected with wideband net-
works. Interstage matching networks introduce additional losses to the complete
LNA, but the impact of these losses on the overall ampliﬁer gain and minimum
achievable noise ﬁgure is dependent on the gain of each stage. If stages with lower
gains are cascaded, interstage matching networks will have a greater impact [8].
This section illustrates two approaches to wideband matching of multistage
LNAs, with speciﬁc focus on interstage and output matching, which are typically
treated together. Input matching was already discussed repeatedly and will not be
treated in this section.
The ﬁrst approach can be taken when all designed LNA stages have a bandpass
response (i.e., the ampliﬁers do not incorporate any form of sloping, such as in the
approach taken to the design of capacitive feedback LNAs where the ﬁrst stage had
a low-pass ampliﬁer response and the second stage had a high-pass ampliﬁer
response). Secondly, it is assumed that the ﬁltering of unwanted harmonic com-
ponents is important. For a three-stage ampliﬁer, a matching approach can be as
illustrated in Fig. 6.13. In this ﬁgure, the ﬁrst interstage ﬁlter has a high-pass
response, the second interstage ﬁlter has a bandpass response and the output
matching network has a low-pass response.
The second approach can be utilized when each ampliﬁer stage has a capacitive
sloped response. In a two-stage conﬁguration, such as the one illustrated in
Fig. 6.14, the output ﬁlter is typically designed to have a bandpass response, but the
interstage network is designed as a network with an opposite (inductive) slope.

Matching is achieved by using either transmission lines or lumped components.
If transmission lines are used, the low-pass frequency behavior can easily be
achieved by using open-ended transmission-line stubs. Wideband behavior is
achieved by using series transmission lines with the electrical length set to the value
of the wideband upper frequency.
Similarly, lumped components can be conﬁgured to achieve a low-pass, band-
pass or high-pass response. The network shown in Fig. 6.15 is a high-pass network.
The two networks in Fig. 6.16 are both bandpass networks with resonant fre-
quencies set by C1 and L1 and C2 and L2 simultaneously. The ﬁrst network has
already been used extensively for input matching throughout this chapter.
An example of an ampliﬁer using the ﬁrst matching approach, that is, the
approach of ﬁltering from Fig. 6.13, is shown in Fig. 6.17. An ampliﬁer using the
second approach, that is, the approach of ﬁltering shown in Fig. 6.14, is shown in
Fig. 6.18.

Multi-stage Topologies for Millimeter-Wave
Applications
As was the case with narrowband ampliﬁers, typical millimeter-wave LNAs are
cascaded ampliﬁers, consisting of two or more cascode stages separated by wide-
band matching described in the previous section. Thus in this section, two further
cascaded LNA conﬁgurations will be described, one using transmission-line
matching and having two cascode stages operating at 60 GHz, and the other one
having ﬁve cascode stages, but using predominantly lumped component matching.
Fritsche et al. [9] present an LNA designed in 28-nm CMOS technology aimed
at purely digital applications. The two-stage ampliﬁer, shown in Fig. 6.19, achieves
13.8 dB of power gain over 18 GHz of bandwidth centered on the 60 GHz band
and consumes 24 mW of DC power from a 2-V supply, while exhibiting a noise
ﬁgure of 4 dB. This paper also demonstrates the challenge of designing an ampliﬁer
in a purely digital CMOS technology where all required passive components
(transmission lines and capacitors) have to be designed and modeled from ﬁrst
principles (as opposed to being provided by the foundry.
The LNA input-matching dual-band network is optimized for 50 X input
impedance of the input pad, and the ﬁrst ampliﬁcation stage is degenerated using a
transmission line for close-to-optimal simultaneous noise and power match. The
interstage matching also uses a dual-band matching network with the addition of a
capacitor, and the second ampliﬁcation stage is once again degenerated with a
transmission line. Finally, the output-matching network transforms the output
impedance to a 50 X load.
Feng et al. [10] present an 88.5–110 GHz LNA in 65-nm CMOS technology. The
ﬁve-stage ampliﬁer, shown in Fig. 6.20, achieves a gain of 16.7 dB and a noise ﬁgure
of 7.2 dB, while consuming 48.6 mW of power. This ampliﬁer demonstrates a
technique whereby the fT of each cascode structure is improved by adding series
inductors between the common-source and common-gate stages within the cascode.
Furthermore, for wideband matching, input and interstage matching are realized using
wideband L-type networks, while the output matching is achieved using a wideband

interstage matching allows small inductor sizes to be used, allowing the integrated
spiral inductors to achieve Q-factor in excess of 10 in the said process.

Distributed and Inductive-Peaking Techniques
for Bandwidth Expansion
A distributed ampliﬁer is a type of a cascaded ampliﬁer where n ampliﬁcation
stages (cells) are cascaded in parallel, such as illustrated in Fig. 6.21, as opposed to
serial cascades typically deployed with LNAs. The individual cells are normally
connected via transmission lines with characteristic impedance Z0. The distributed
ampliﬁer quickly gained popularity because of the fact that very high power gains
could be obtained over wide frequency bands [4]. The overall voltage gain of a
distributed ampliﬁer is

where Gm is the gain of the individual ampliﬁer cell. In theory, this means that with
n large enough, a distributed ampliﬁer built with lossless components can provide
gain even above the fT of the single ampliﬁer cell. In practice, however, this is not
possible as the signal deteriorates on the input line.
In addition to the high gain described by Eq. (6.28) and the wide bandwidth that
is readily achievable by wide input impedance matching practices, the distributed
ampliﬁer has excellent stability and linearity. The presence of the resistor Z0 in
Fig. 6.21, normally chosen as a 50 X resistor and necessary for input impedance
matching, however, degrades the noise performance of the distributed ampliﬁer,
making it unsuitable for LNA applications.
In this section, it will be shown how a general distributed ampliﬁer can be turned
into an LNA by replacing RG with a combination of passive components and a
careful design of gain cells [11, 12]. This can be achieved by replacing Z0 with two
resistors RG1 and RG2, where an inductor appears in parallel to RG2. This modiﬁ-
cation turns a resistive gate terminal into an RL terminal. The effect of this on
ampliﬁer performance is twofold: ampliﬁer noise performance is improved but this
comes at the expense of a small degradation in the impedance matching
performance.
A circuit diagram of a two-cell distributed ampliﬁer incorporating inductors
instead of transmission lines together with gate impedance modiﬁcation is shown in
Fig. 6.22. This circuit can be analyzed if it is assumed that individual gain cells
have the input (or only) stages built by MOSFETs with gate capacitances Cg1 and
Cg2 (both are sums of respective capacitances Cgs and Cgd, for simplicity). To
compute the input impedance, the circuit can be observed at the RFin port, which is
between RS and LG1. The simpliﬁed circuit diagram is then shown in Fig. 6.23. By
using circuit transformations, it can be shown that the input impedance is

The response of the gain of the distributed ampliﬁer will depend on the gain cell
chosen as its building block. The requirement to retain wideband ampliﬁcation
(in line with wideband impedance matching) is to adopt a cell with ﬂat S21. A good
candidate for such performance is the cell depicted in Fig. 6.24. This cell has two
stages: the ﬁrst is the inductively peaking cascode stage with a low-Q RLC load,
and the second is an inductively peaking common-source stage. Using small-signal
analysis (omitted here), and making some logical simpliﬁcations, its gain can be
approximated in the frequency domain to

Finally, the noise factor of n cascaded cells can be computed by doing the noise

Equation (6.40) shows that the noise of the complete distributed ampliﬁer
decreases with the number of cascaded cells. In fact, by recalling Eq. (6.28), it can be
established that highly gaining LNAs can indeed be created by just increasing the
number of cells arbitrarily. Naturally, limitations such as power consumption, signal
degradation and circuit complexity (a large number of passive components are
required), limit the extension of distributed ampliﬁers to two or three distributed cells.
As one of the possible solutions to the increased power consumption metric of
distributed ampliﬁers, inductive peaking can be used in regular LNAs in interstage
matching instead. Such a circuit diagram is shown in Fig. 6.25 [13]. The conﬁguration
consists of two complementary common-gate gain stages connected by an m-derived
peaking circuit. The bandwidth can be increased from a value of xU (bandwidth of the
matching circuit without peaking) to xU1 by a factor of

Other Broadband Techniques
The LNA conﬁgurations discussed up to now in this chapter are naturally not the
only wideband conﬁgurations. Various other techniques can be used to extend the
bandwidth of an LNA. For example, a common-gate ampliﬁer can be matched over
wide bandwidth, and its bandwidth can further be enhanced by adding feedback.
Differential conﬁgurations are also appealing for wideband design. Differential
conﬁgurations could assist in inductorless implementations as well. Furthermore,
feedback could be enhanced by the addition of active devices in the feedback loop,
leading to active feedback conﬁgurations.
Figure 6.26 shows some common-gate conﬁgurations. In Fig. 6.26a, a simple
shunt-feedback common-gate LNA is shown [14]. In Fig. 6.26b, a common-gate
conﬁguration is combined with T-type input matching and a self-body bias scheme.
The circuit in Fig. 6.26c deploys shunt feedback and current reuse and does not
require inductors, but in turn requires large capacitors. The circuit in Fig. 6.26d is a
differential conﬁguration, which uses a double gm-enhancement technique. Finally,
in Fig. 6.26e, a balun is used to feed a single-ended signal into a differential
conﬁguration that uses a gm-enhancement technique and noise cancelation.
A complementary common-gate conﬁguration of the ﬁrst wideband LNA stage,
which deploys one transformer instead of two inductors, was also proposed recently
[15].
The
two-stage
ampliﬁer,
which
also
deploys
a
single-transistor
common-source second stage, is shown in Fig. 6.27. In this ﬁgure, the inductors
Ls1,p and Ls1,n in the ﬁrst stage are actually two inductors built from two transformer
windings. If the transformer is connected in the common mode, then if L1 is the
inductance of the primary winding and L2 is the inductance of the secondary
winding, it can be modeled as a T-network with inductances L1 −M, L2 −M and

M, as illustrated in Fig. 6.28. This means that Ls1,p and Ls1,n are built as trans-
formers having inductances L1 and L2 respectively, and with M equally shared
between them. This conﬁguration therefore saves chip area (the transformer can be
seen as two smaller inductors lying on top of each other), and also introduces the
current reuse technique, hence decreasing power consumption.
The complementary common-gate stage on its own, however, yields poor
bandwidth performance. The ﬁrst stage needs to be loaded with the second stage in
order to improve bandwidth. The second stage is therefore designed as a
common-source stage, with components chosen and arranged to keep the ﬂat gain
response and low noise ﬁgure across the whole band of interest.
Two more wideband conﬁgurations are shown in Fig. 6.29. The conﬁguration in
Fig. 6.29a [14] deploys noise cancelation and current reuse in achieving
low-voltage operation. The circuit in Fig. 6.29b [4], on the other hand, is a
two-stage active-feedback circuit, which uses the secondary voltage source VSS as a
means of adjusting the positive feedback current through resistor Rss, and requires
no inductors or DC-blocking capacitors.

Concluding Remarks
In this chapter, wideband LNAs were discussed. It was seen that the same
topologies as for narrowband LNAs can be used, but some additional circuitry is
needed, in the form of feedback, matching, or bandwidth widening. Numerous
variations of common-source, cascode, feedback or cascaded ampliﬁer circuits and
combinations thereof are most commonly used. In wideband LNAs, the bandwidth
is traded off against gain, and this often requires multiple gain stages to be included
to reach similar gain to that of one-stage narrowband LNAs. It was also shown that,
although linearity of wideband LNAs is generally improved (e.g. by feedback or
because of reduced gains of some LNA stages), wideband LNAs tend to suffer from
a higher noise ﬁgure than that of narrowband LNAs. In wideband LNAs, impe-
dance matching has greater importance than in the case of narrowband LNAs. In the
former, input, interstage and output matching all become determining factors in the
LNA design, whereas in narrowband LNAs, typically only input impedance

matching is considered. Impedance matching is therefore an important aspect of
LNA design, and to achieve bandwidth large enough to span multiple octaves, often
both lumped and distributed matching needs to be deployed.
Furthermore, in the millimeter-wave age, wideband LNA design comes with its
unique challenges. In principle, the LNA topologies used in the millimeter-wave
regime do not differ signiﬁcantly from RF and microwave LNA topologies, with the
exception that typically, a larger number of cascaded stages need to be used. LNA
designs with ﬁve LNA stages are not uncommon at millimeter-wave frequencies.
This chapter concludes the two-chapter treatment of general, narrowband and
wideband LNAs and concludes Part I of this book, where research contextualization
was worked through starting from telecommunication aspects of LNA design, via
treatment of semiconductor technologies and active and passive devices all the way
to the LNA theory. From the discussion conducted thus far, it is evident that the
current trend in millimeter-wave LNA design is based on the approach where RF
and microwave LNAs are ported into the millimeter wave regime, but simple
translation is not necessarily the best way. Part II thus deals with the state of the art
in the ﬁeld of LNAs, making an effort to identify the weaknesses of the state-of-the
art technology, and to offer techniques for the improvement of current LNA
designs, with the focus on optimization of LNA parts. The introductory chapter of
Part II, Chap. 7 that follows, explores the state-of-the-art LNAs.

on
state-of-the-art LNAs for millimeter-wave applications only. A number of conﬁg-

their advantages over other published works, as well as disadvantages and the

their components will be discussed in detail in two more chapters, Chaps. 8 and 9,
with some ﬁnal remarks left for Chap. 10.
With Chap. 6, the theoretical research contextualization, Part I of this book was
concluded. Chap. 7 marks the beginning of Part II of the book, consisting of four
chapters. While the previous chapters (Part I) encompassed LNAs operating in
different regimes, not only the millimeter-wave, the focus of this chapter will be on
state-of-the-art LNAs for millimeter-wave applications only. A number of conﬁg-
urations published in the last ﬁve to ten years will be explored, with the emphasis

and their components will be discussed in detail in two more chapters, Chaps. 8 and

Generally, the popular cascode conﬁguration cannot provide enough signal
ampliﬁcation on its own. However, a few attempts to deploy single-cascode stages
in the millimeter-wave regime have been made. These are presented in the opening
section of this chapter. Differential conﬁgurations are possibly more suitable for
millimeter-wave ampliﬁcation, especially if frequencies increase beyond 100 GHz,
and will be handled in the following section. Other conﬁgurations, typically con-
sisting of several ampliﬁcation stages, however, are evidently most suitable for this
daunting task, and the central part of this chapter will be dedicated to the review of
these conﬁgurations. Because of their potential for reuse with different carrier
frequencies and in different bands, most of these conﬁgurations are directed at

wideband applications. One section will explore conﬁgurations that reach fre-
quencies of 200 GHz and above.
Each of the identiﬁed groups will be evaluated in terms of performance and their
main weaknesses will be identiﬁed. Finally, the chapter will conclude with a short

7.1
State-of-the-Art Cascode Conﬁgurations
The cascode conﬁguration was shown in Chaps. 5 and 6 to be capable of achieving
both narrowband and broadband operation. The inductive source degradation was
typically used to allow for simultaneous noise and power matching, and the cas-
coding itself was used to decrease the inﬂuence of the Miller effect, as well as to aid
in increasing the voltage gain by virtue of increasing the output resistance. The
capabilities made the cascode conﬁguration the most popular choice even in
multi-stage LNA conﬁgurations, most often for building the ﬁrst stage of the LNA,
and sometimes to build other stages as well. This section presents some stand-alone
state-of-the-art cascode conﬁgurations deployed at millimeter-wave frequencies.
7.1.1
A 60-GHz BiCMOS Low-Noise Ampliﬁer Deploying
a Conductive Path to Ground
The ﬁrst cascode conﬁguration explored is that proposed by Alvarado et al. [1]. In
this paper, a 60-GHz V-band cascode LNA fabricated in 130 nm SiGe BiCMOS
technology with fT of 200 GHz is presented. A simpliﬁed schematic of the proposed
LNA, including biasing, is shown in Fig. 7.1. The LNA consists of one cascode
stage, thus reducing the power consumption and complexity. The input and output
matching are performed with the aid of transmission lines.
This circuit deploys two techniques in order to improve the performance of the
very simple one-stage cascode ampliﬁer in conjunction with normal biasing and
transistor sizing for high fT, maximum gain and the lowest noise ﬁgure.
The ﬁst technique is geared towards reducing the noise associated with typical
semi-resistive substrates. This is achieved by providing a highly conductive path
from the substrate to the circuit ground. A uniformly distributed AC and DC ground
plane is placed on the substrate. Furthermore, the technique includes strategic
placement of substrate contacts, blocking of bipolar implants as well as deep trench
isolation lattice near high-frequency active elements, that is, transistors of the
cascode. The overall effect is reduced noise injection through the substrate.
The second technique is geared towards optimizing the transmission lines used
in the design, but is closely related to the technique to decrease transistor noise.

Basically, the transmission line is laid on top of the AC/DC ground plane used in
the complete circuit, with additional ground planes arranged around the conducting
microstrip line, as illustrated in Fig. 7.2. Incidentally, the highest Q-factor of the
line is obtained for the 60-X characteristic impedance.
The measured S-parameters of this conﬁguration show the peak gain of 14.5 dB
at 59 GHz, with at least 12 dB gain across the 57–64 GHz unlicensed band. The
average noise ﬁgure is 5 dB, with the minimum noise ﬁgure of 4.1 dB found at
59 GHz. The LNA consumes 4.5 mA from a 1.8 V supply. The IIP3 with 50 MHz
tone spacing is extrapolated to −2 dBm.

A 77-GHz BiCMOS Low-Power Low-Noise Ampliﬁer
Low power remains one of the main goals in ampliﬁer design. The simplicity of the
cascode conﬁguration allows low-power LNAs to be implemented, even if one
stage is insufﬁcient to reach the desired gain ﬁgures. Chen et al. [2] thus proposed a

low-power two-stage W-band 77-GHz LNA suitable for millimeter-wave imaging.
This LNA is built in 180 nm BiCMOS technology with fT of 200 GHz. The
schematic is shown in Fig. 7.3. The second stage is introduced to improve the
linearity of the ampliﬁer at the expense of some circuit complexity, but is powered
from a lower voltage supply to minimize power consumption.
This LNA was designed such that the minimum achievable noise ﬁgure NFmin
value is traded off for high power gain in the ﬁrst, cascode, stage. It was found that
this compromise allowed smaller HBTs to be used. This is in contrast to the typical
approach where all available transistor base ﬁngers are used in high-frequency
BiCMOS design. In this case, the new approach allowed only two-base ﬁngers to be
used. Similarly, a two-base device was used in the second stage as well. Cascode
active devices were sized for wideband noise matching. Furthermore, the ﬁrst stage
was optimally biased for low NFmin, while the second stage was biased for linearity.
Required inductors, including emitter degeneration inductors as well as match-
ing inductors, were all designed using transmission lines. The interstage matching
was optimized for a compromise between bandwidth, gain and linearity. Finally,
the circuit also includes output impedance matching to the 50 X load and the design
incorporates wideband bypass capacitor arrays to reduce ground bounces and
increase stability, with the last further supported by layout techniques.
This ampliﬁer showed a peak gain of 14.5 dB at 77 GHz with 14.5 GHz of
bandwidth spanning from 69 to 83.5 GHz, making it suitable for imaging and
automotive applications. The noise ﬁgure is lower than 8 dB almost across the
complete band of interest, with the minimum noise ﬁgure of 6.9 dB obtained at
77 GHz. As mentioned already, the higher noise ﬁgure is due to the chosen
two-base transistor, as well as to the wideband matching. Note, however, that the
ampliﬁer uses two different voltage supplies, a higher supply of 3.3 V for the ﬁrst
stage and a lower 1.5 V supply for the second stage, thus achieving a power
consumption ﬁgure of only 37 mW. Although the power consumption ﬁgure is

larger than in the previous conﬁguration, this LNA achieved this ﬁgure while
retaining larger bandwidth and operating at the higher frequency band. The IIP3
achieved was between −2 and 0 dBm.
7.1.3
A 33–34 GHz Narrowband Low-Noise Ampliﬁer
with Low Noise Figure
A very low noise ﬁgure can be achieved by cascode LNAs operating at frequencies
that just reach the millimeter-wave band (Ka-band). A good example of such a
conﬁguration is presented by Min et al. [3]. In this work, ﬁrst principles were
utilized to design a 33–34 GHz LNA with an average low noise ﬁgure of only
2.9 dB. The LNA was built in 120 nm BiCMOS technology with fT of 200 GHz.
The proposed ampliﬁer consists of two matched cascode stages, where the ﬁrst
stage utilizes inductive source degeneration. The circuit diagram of this LNA is
shown in Fig. 7.1. Simultaneous input noise and power matching was obtained
using the optimization technique described in Sect. 5.2.2 [see Fig. 5.14 and
Eq. (5.29)], in fact, the paper by Min et al. was the ﬁrst to present this approach.
In this work, the inductor LE utilized a small-value thin-line inductor structure,
while the 1.5-turn spiral inductors were utilized for other inductances. Interstage
matching utilized an LC network, while the RLC network was utilized for output
impedance matching to 50 X (Fig. 7.4).
The reported measured results show 23.5 dB worth of gain at 34 GHz and
remain greater than 15 dB over the Ka-band frequency range. In addition, the LNA
reaches an input return loss of less than −20 dB at the center frequency, draws
6 mA from a 1.8-V supply and shows the 1 dB gain compression point at the

at the lowest point and remains below 3.2 dB over the entire Ka-band.
7.1.4
A 70–100 GHz Wideband Low-Noise Ampliﬁer
with Split Inductor Output Matching
In contrast to the previous paper where an LNA is designed for operation at the
lower boundary of the millimeter-wave frequency range, Shahramian et al. [4]
presented an integrated wideband transceiver capable of operating across E- and W-
commercial bands at 71–76, 81–86 and 92–95 GHz. The LNA deployed for the
receiver part of the chipset is capable of ampliﬁcation from 70 to 100 GHz and is
built in 180 nm BiCMOS technology. The LNA is the single cascode stage with
split inductor output matching, as illustrated in Fig. 7.5. The complete receiver IC
deploys a four-branch phased array, requiring four LNAs in total, thus the single
cascode stage was chosen to aid in decreasing the overall size of the receiver. As is
evident from Fig. 7.5, each LNA deploys source degeneration through an inductor,
an input matching network aided by the gate inductor and the shunt capacitor, and a
split inductor for output impedance matching.
Based on measured results, this conﬁguration achieves the minimum noise ﬁgure
at 90 GHz of 6.5 dB. The noise ﬁgure remains below 7 dB between 75 and
95 GHz. The maximum gain of the receiver is 37 dB over a bandwidth of 20 GHz,
with four receiver branches exhibiting a gain variation of less than 0.5 dB. The
input compression point is better than −35 dBm across the complete band of
interest.

7.1.5
Triple and Quadruple CMOS Cascode Low-Noise
Ampliﬁers
The cascode circuit discussed up to now in this chapter and even in this book
consisted of two connected transistors, one in the common-source conﬁguration and
the other in the common-gate conﬁguration. This cascode conﬁguration can be
understood as the double cascode conﬁguration. However, the number of
common-gate conﬁgurations can be increased to build triple, quadruple and mul-
tiple cascode conﬁgurations. In this way, LNAs with improved GBP can be built,
and incidentally, using techniques that deploy transformer coupling, power con-
sumption and compact size can also be achieved. Figure 7.6 illustrates the
low-frequency double, triple and quadruple cascodes [5].
With the increasing number of common-gate connected transistors connected,
however, the inﬂuence of the parasitic capacitors increases. It is common practice,
even in the classic double cascode, to add a series-connected middle inductor, Lm,
to resonate out the transistor parasitics and improve the fT of the cascode [6]. Yeh
et al. [5] deployed this methodology to build triple and quadruple MOS cascodes in
a 90-nm CMOS process. As the number of cascode transistors increases, the
number of inductors connected in series increases as well, therefore the authors
proposed using a transformer to utilize the coupling of inductor spirals to achieve
higher apparent inductor values, similar to what was seen in Chap. 6. The triple and
quadruple cascodes deployed with transformer separation are illustrated in Fig. 7.7.
With this technique, the area taken up by inductors also decreases, and so does
the power consumption. This comes at the expense of a somewhat increased noise
ﬁgure. Another concern that appears as a consequence is the stability of the
ampliﬁer, which tends to decrease with the number of cascoded transistors that need

to be ensured. Furthermore, transistors need to be sized such that the noise ﬁgure is
minimized, but transistor M1 also needs to be sized to deliver enough gain. The last
transistor in the cascode (M3 for the triple cascode and M4 for the quadruple
cascode) also needs to be sized for linearity. The coupling coefﬁcient of the
transformer spirals tends to inﬂuence the bandwidth: with the higher coupling
coefﬁcient, the bandwidth decreases, so the tradeoff between the bandwidth and the
chip real estate is evident. Additional small inductors are still needed in the input
and output signal path for impedance matching, also illustrated in Fig. 7.7.
The viability of the triple cascode was demonstrated by the authors of [5] for the
V-band, while a quadruple LNA was demonstrated in the Q-band. The V-band triple
cascode LNA shows a peak gain of 12.5 dB at 58 GHz from a 3 V supply, while
consuming 18 mW of power. The power consumption can be decreased to 14 mW
by decreasing the supply voltage to 2.4 V. Gain is ﬂat between 43 and 58 GHz and
the minimum noise ﬁgure is 4.7 dB at 62.5 GHz.
The quadruple-cascode Q-band ampliﬁer can reach 20.3 dB of gain at 40 GHz,
with 15 mW of power consumed from a 3.3 V supply. The 3-dB bandwidth is
located at 32 and 44 GHz. The minimum noise ﬁgure of 4.6 dB is achieved at
40 GHz.

A 60-GHz Two-Stage Cascode CMOS Low-Noise
Ampliﬁer with Middle Inductors
The last cascode conﬁguration that will be described in this section is the two-stage
cascode LNA with a middle inductor, Lm, in both cascode stages, built in 90-nm
CMOS technology with fT = 120 GHz. The LNA, presented by Yao et al. [7] and
illustrated in Fig. 7.8, utilized spiral inductors for source degeneration of the ﬁrst
stage, input matching, interstage matching and output matching and for the middle
inductor. The ampliﬁer was optimized algorithmically for the minimum noise ﬁgure
using a current density optimization technique.
The ampliﬁer reached a noise ﬁgure lower than 5.5, 14.6 dB gain and drew
16 mA from a 1.5-V supply, while maintaining the 3-dB bandwidth of 13 GHz.
7.1.7
Other Conﬁgurations
In Chap. 5, another cascode conﬁguration was presented. The two-stage low-power
LNA was depicted earlier in Fig. 5.17 [8] and described in Sect. 5.3.4. The LNA
was fabricated in the 250 nm BiCMOS process with fT = 200 GHz. Its gain reaches
18 dB at 61 GHz and the ampliﬁer has a noise ﬁgure of 5.6 dB, with reverse
isolation of 60 dB. The measured power consumption is 7.5 mW and the input
compression point is −18 dB, while maintaining a narrow bandwidth of 4 GHz.
One more cascode conﬁguration was already shown in Chap. 5. The two-stage
CMOS LNA in Fig. 5.18 [9] is designed to provide robust ESD protection in the
65-nm technology node. It has a minimum noise ﬁgure of 5.3 dB, achieves 17.5 dB
gain at 58.5 GHz and has input return loss greater than 21 dB. The measured power
consumption is 18 mW. The additional ESD protection decreases achievable
bandwidths to 7 GHz.

Performance Analysis
The main performance parameters of cascode conﬁgurations presented throughout
this section are tabulated in Table 7.1. The main determining factors are, naturally,
the noise ﬁgure, frequency of operation, gain, bandwidth, power consumption and
technology implementation. The complexity of the topologies is also investigated
by stipulating the number of deployed stages. For each applicable parameter, the
best (highest or lowest) value in the table is highlighted in bold.
Note that the LNA in Sect. 7.1.4 had to be excluded from this analysis because it
forms part of the receiver that compensates for the gain, possibly leading to mis-
interpretation of results.
7.1.9
Weaknesses of the State-of-the-Art Conﬁgurations
Cascode conﬁgurations considered in this section were all fairly simple single-stage
or double-stage ampliﬁers. The main weakness that can be isolated with such
conﬁgurations is that the simplicity needs to be traded off for the sacriﬁce in at least
one of the important LNA considerations. Typically, given that priority is normally
given to the noise ﬁgure, the sacriﬁce is made either in the case of the gain or the
bandwidth of the LNA. All the conﬁgurations presented have moderate gain; in
addition the bandwidth is typically limited to several GHz. The largest gain con-
ﬁguration is, in fact, a narrowband conﬁguration. Furthermore, it can be noted that
none of these state-of-the art conﬁgurations crossed the 100 GHz mark.
Therefore, it is clear that the circuit complexity needs to be increased to
simultaneously achieve several LNA objectives. The answer could be sought in
somewhat more complex conﬁgurations, viz. differential conﬁgurations, presented
next.
7.2
State-of-the-Art Differential Conﬁgurations
The advantages of differential LNA conﬁgurations were seen in Chap. 5. The ability
to achieve larger bandwidth ﬁgures than the single-ended ampliﬁers is one of the
main considerations leading to differential LNA research. This section thus
demonstrates some simple, yet powerful differential conﬁgurations deployed
recently.

120-GHz BiCMOS Two-Stage Differential Cascode
Low-Noise Ampliﬁer
Öztürk et al. [10] presented a 120-GHz two-stage cascode LNA built in 130 nm
BiCMOS technology with fT of 250 GHz. This fully differential LNA is meant to
operate in phased array radar systems that are gaining popularity in military and
civil radar and high-data communication applications. The circuit diagram of this
LNA is shown in Fig. 7.9.
In this LNA, the differential architecture is followed in order to aid
common-mode noise reduction, even-order harmonic cancelation, robustness in
wire bonding and parasitic cancelation. Furthermore, each stage was chosen as
cascode. First, an inductively degenerated cascode stage was deployed for the
lowest noise ﬁgure, at the expense of reduced gain. Correct biasing of this stage is
achieved through current mirrors, and special effort was invested in reduction of the
asymmetry between the single-ended half circuits of two differential ampliﬁer
stages. Lower gain of the ﬁrst stage was compensated for by the addition of the
second cascode stage.
Since this LNA is aimed at phased array applications where four receiving
channels are placed in parallel, the authors focused on reducing the size of all
components and the complete LNA. All inductors were deployed as bent microstrip
lines, designed with the aid of an EM simulator. Capacitors were deployed as MIM
capacitors. Matching, including interstage matching, was achieved using simple LC
networks, and Marchand balun structures were used at both input and output to tie
the LNA to the input and output impedances of 50 and 100 X respectively.

The fabricated LNA exhibited 13 dB of gain centered on 125 GHz. The band-
width was found to be 14 GHz. The minimum noise ﬁgure of 8 dB was reached at
122 GHz, and the conﬁguration drew 38 mA from a 2.5-V supply.

120-GHz CMOS Transformer-Matched Four-Stage
Common Source Low-Noise Ampliﬁer
Heller et al. [11] researched an LNA for an I/Q receiver front end of a V-band
transceiver deploying continuous-phase PSK modulation in a 28-nm CMOS pro-
cess. The proposed LNA, shown in Fig. 7.10, consists of four differential
common-source transistor ampliﬁers, connected using 1:1 low-k transformers for
increased bandwidth.
Each stage of the LNA consists of capacitively neutralized common-source
pairs,

of
common-source-connected transistors biased via large resistors, as illustrated in
Fig. 7.11. The neutralization is necessary to improve the differential stability of the
common-source pairs, but once again, it comes as a trade-off against the minimum
achievable noise ﬁgure. The differential transistors were sized for optimal fT.
In addition to the inter-stage matching transformers, 1:2 and 2:1 transformers
were needed at the input and output of the conﬁguration respectively, for
single-ended to differential conversion. Transformer windings were fabricated using
the ultra-thick metal available in the process. All required capacitors were deployed
as MIM capacitors utilizing the available thick and ultra-thick metals.

The fabricated LNA exhibited a noise ﬁgure between 8.4 and 10.4 dB over the
28 GHz of bandwidth spanning from 104 to 132 GHz. The measured results further
showed the gain of 21.7 dB in the band of interest, while achieving power con-
sumption of 18 mW from a 1 V supply.
7.2.3
Load-Isolated Transformer-Feedback CMOS
Low-Noise Ampliﬁer at 60 GHz
In contrast to the previous two differential papers mentioned, Wu et al. [12] recently
proposed a CMOS LNA for 60 GHz operation with wideband input matching and
noise cancellation. The LNA uses load-isolated transformer feedback.
The feedback is established as illustrated in Fig. 7.12 for the common-source
and cascode conﬁgurations, where L1 is the primary transformer winding and L2 is
the secondary one. In both Fig. 7.12a, b the current set in transistor M1 ﬂows
through the secondary winding L2 before going to the load. As such, the current fed
into the primary coil L1 is not affected by the load, and as a result, higher
transconductances over wide bandwidths can be obtained. The noise ﬁgure is also
decreased; however, due to transistor parasitics at millimeter-wave frequencies, this
effect is mostly only visible at RF frequencies. To improve the performance at
60 GHz, however, multiple techniques are deployed. Firstly, the LNA was
deployed as a two-stage differential conﬁguration, as illustrated in Fig. 7.13. The
differential topology is chosen to improve on the common-mode rejection and
even-order harmonic suppression and to minimize the effect of parasitic inductance.
The ﬁrst stage is the differential common-source conﬁguration with transformer
feedback, where the common-source is preferred over the cascode to avoid addi-
tional parasitics associated with increased transistor count. The second stage is the
classic cascode conﬁguration with no feedback utilized for high gain. In this
topology, the second stage also allows for variable-gain control via current steering.
In this paper, input matching was deployed in two stages in order to minimize
the noise ﬁgure. The source impedance of 50 X was ﬁrst transformed to an

impedance ZA, which corresponded to the lowest noise ﬁgure of the input tran-
sistors, and thereafter the transformer-aided matching was used to match the input
impedance to ZA. In this way, the noise ﬁgure was optimized but the gain was
decreased by a small amount. Furthermore, the baluns were integrated to convert
single-ended signals to differential ones and vice versa. An additional output buffer
stage is also included. Transformers and baluns used were interleaved to obtain a
coupling factor of about 0.4.
As a result, the fabricated LNA for the 60-GHz unlicensed band fabricated in the
130-nm CMOS process exhibited a 3-dB bandwidth of 10 GHz between 55 and
65 GHz. A minimum value of 6.8 dB for the noise ﬁgure was reached, with a gain
of 16.4 dB. The power dissipation was 33.6 mW.
7.2.4
Performance Analysis
The performance analysis of differential topologies presented in this section is
summarized in Table 7.2, similar to what was done earlier.
7.2.5
Weaknesses of the State-of-the-Art Conﬁgurations
The three conﬁgurations shown in this section are clearly an improvement on the
single-ended cascode conﬁgurations seen in Sect. 7.1. Two of the reported LNAs
have crossed the 120 GHz mark, while one is geared towards the 60 GHz unli-
censed band. In the case of the ﬁrst LNA, only 14 GHz of bandwidth and 13 dB of
gain were seen, ﬁgures that can most certainly be improved upon. The second
conﬁguration uses capacitance neutralization and transformer-based matching, and
achieves large bandwidth (double the ﬁrst conﬁguration) and much larger gain
(21.7 dB) at half the power consumption. The 60-GHz conﬁguration shows a

reasonable percentage bandwidth; however, this is far from optimum. The noise
ﬁgure of all conﬁgurations still remains fairly high. The necessity to deploy baluns
moreover complicates the circuit fabrication.
Conﬁgurations presented in the next section, however, adopt several different
approaches to achieve even better performance ﬁgures and very high bandwidths.
Typically, this is possible either through a signiﬁcant increase in circuit complexity
or by taking technologies other than CMOS and BiCMOS into consideration.

Complex Wideband State-of-the-Art Conﬁgurations

beneﬁts of which have been discussed in Chap. 6. This is typically achieved by
multistage conﬁgurations. Furthermore, complex cascades of LNA stages are also
required to reach very high frequencies, even if wide bandwidth is not required.
This section presents a number of such conﬁgurations, starting with simpler ones
and moving towards more complex ones.
7.3.1
A Linear Low-Power-Consumption BiCMOS
Two-Stage Transformer-Coupled Cascode-Cascade
Low-Noise Ampliﬁer
The ﬁrst conﬁguration that will be presented in this section is a two-stage
transformer-coupled cascode 130-nm BiCMOS LNA that was optimized for low
power consumption and high linearity, over a wide bandwidth between 22 and
32.5-GHz, presented by Geha et al. [13]. The upper portion of the wide band
reaches into the millimeter-wave regime, therefore this conﬁguration can be con-
sidered as coexisting in microwave and millimeter-wave bands.
Linearity is attained by using a constant Gm-cell that is formed from the
balun-LNA structure. The Gm-cell transconductance is independent of input and
output variations and provides second-order intermodulation distortion cancella-
tions. The schematic of this LNA is shown in Fig. 7.14. In this ﬁgure, the Q1 is the
main transconductance gain stage, coupled to the auxiliary gain path Q2, which
increases the signal swing at the second stage. This allows the power consumption
to be decreased. The combination of Q2 and Q3 improves the linearity of the circuit.
The transformer coupling, however, inﬂuences the input matching, which requires
detailed input impedance analysis followed by optimization for noise. The output
uses the inductance peaking technique to extend the bandwidth of the circuit. The
inductor, Lm, is once again added to resonate the parasitic capacitance of the emitter
of Q3, thus reducing the output noise. Transformer coupling allows the signal to be
propagated along two paths, thus resulting in a differential output, which would
require a balun to connect to single-ended inputs.

State-of-the-Art Differential Conﬁgurations

The circuit utilized a combination of spiral and transmission line inductors.
Inductors with larger values were designed as spiral inductors, and smaller
inductors were designed as inductive transmission lines. All structures used the
thickest top metal available in the process. The transformer was implemented as a
stacked structure with k = 0.34, and with both primary and secondary windings
having only one turn.
The measured S-parameters showed a maximum gain of 15.4 dB over the fre-
quency band of interest, while reaching a noise ﬁgure between 4.5 and 6 dB. The
input reﬂection (S11) was kept below −8.7 dB, IIP3 was −5.7 dBm and DC power
consumption of only 5 mW was achieved from a 1.8-V supply.

different topology of the transconductance (gain) cell. As a result, a three-stage
LNA deploying high gm  Rout stages was proposed.
In the cell shown in Fig. 7.15, two additional transistors, M2 and M3, are con-
nected to the common-source transistor M1, and they both share the current pro-
vided by M1. Right-sizing of M2 and M3 can result in both the transconductance gm
and Rout being high, with the same power consumed and a noise ﬁgure that is
somewhat lower than would be found in the classic common-source conﬁguration.
Noise ﬁgure worsening is attributed to the contribution of noise sources of M2 and
M3. The output of each stage is taken at the drain of M3.
The three-stage cascade is shown in Fig. 7.16, where only the ﬁrst stage has
inductive source degeneration. Simultaneous noise and power matching are
attempted at the input and furthermore, shunt and double-series peaking are
deployed at the output ﬁrst two stages. At the output, T-coil bandwidth enhance-
ment is performed.
The ampliﬁer was fabricated in 65-nm CMOS technology. The measured results
show an average gain of 13.4 dB with the 3-dB bandwidth from 48 to 64.7 GHz.
The average measured noise ﬁgure value is 6.1 dB. S11, S22, and S12 are lower than
−10, −10 and −37 dB respectively. The ampliﬁer consumes about 9.6 mA of
current from a 1-V supply.

The LNA deploys a cascade of ﬁve common-emitter stages without emitter
degeneration, as illustrated in Fig. 7.17. Common-emitter stages were selected for
this application for three main reasons. First, the common-emitter conﬁguration
requires lower supply voltage, which was a requirement associated with the
application. Secondly, this conﬁguration is less susceptible to parasitic capacitance
effects. Finally, cascading of the common-gate stages requires networks with lower
Q-factors. The main drawback, however, is the need for cascading more stages to
achieve the required gain values.
Thus, stages 1 and 2 were optimized for a close to minimum noise ﬁgure, and
stages 3 to 5 were optimized for high gain. Interstage matching was achieved using
metal-oxide-metal (MOM) capacitors and shunt transmission line stubs with a
characteristic impedance of 56 X. Furthermore, MOM capacitors were placed
underneath the inductive transmission lines to aid with supply decoupling. Finally,
a deep trench was placed beneath the interstage matching capacitors for reduced
substrate coupling.

The LNA achieved a peak gain of 23 dB at 96 GHz and a noise ﬁgure of 8 dB.
The 3 dB bandwidth was measured to be between 83 and 103 GHz.
7.3.4
71–86-GHz BiCMOS Low-Noise Ampliﬁer as Part
of a Bidirectional Power Ampliﬁer/Low-Noise
Ampliﬁer System
Ebrahimi et al. [17] present a 71–86 GHz LNA as part of a phased array transceiver
using wideband injection-locked oscillator phase shifters, deployed in 90-nm
BiCMOS technology with an fT of 300 GHz. The required transceiver application
necessitated an ampliﬁer conﬁguration that can be conﬁgured as either a power
ampliﬁer or an LNA (PALNA), as shown in Fig. 7.18. Essentially, the ampliﬁer
consists of a separate power ampliﬁer and LNA branches, connected using
transmission-line T-junction combiners. In receive mode, the LNA is enabled and
the power ampliﬁer is disabled, and the impedance of the LNA is matched to the
rest of the circuitry (the antenna and the mixer), while the power ampliﬁer appears
as an open circuit. The power combiner is furthermore designed not to inﬂuence the
operation of either circuit, except for the reported 1 dB insertion loss.
The LNA portion of the circuit is designed as a three-stage common-emitter
ampliﬁer, as shown in Fig. 7.19. The ﬁrst stage is designed and optimized with the
noise ﬁgure in mind, with the emitter degenerated with an inductive transmission
line. The second and third stages are optimized and biased for high gain, and are
deployed without any emitter degeneration. The input, output and matching net-
works are all implemented using coplanar waveguides with 50 X characteristic
impedance and available MIM capacitors.

The LNA simulations indicated a noise ﬁgure value of 6.6 dB at 78 GHz while
providing 24-dB worth of gain. Measurements indicated a noise ﬁgure of 8.5 dB at
73 GHz that remains below 10 dB across the complete band of interest.
7.3.5
A 71-81 GHz CMOS Low-Noise Ampliﬁer
Lin et al. [18] presented a 90-nm CMOS LNA capable of operating over 71–67,
76–77 and 77–81 GHz frequency ranges in W-band. The reported fT of the tech-
nology used was 230 GHz. The LNA consisted of three common-source stages, as
illustrated in Fig. 7.20.
In order to maximize the bandwidth of S21, the output of each stage was loaded
with a low-Q RLC parallel resonant circuit. The simultaneous noise and power
matching at the input of the LNA was obtained by appropriately selecting the values
of transmission lines TL1 to TL18, together with the size and bias of the transistor
driving the input stage (M1). The excessively long transmission lines were bent to
save the area of the IC, as illustrated in the photograph of the IC shown in Fig. 7.21.
The measurement results S11, S21, S12, S22 and the noise ﬁgure of this LNA are
shown in Fig. 7.22. The minimum S11 and S22 reached are both below −10 dB,
while the gain S21 is greater than 12 dB over the whole band of interest. The reverse
isolation (S12) is better than −29 dB throughout. The minimum noise ﬁgure of
6.2 dB is achieved at 78 GHz, with the noise ﬁgure not exceeding 7.4 dB in the
band of interest. Furthermore, the authors reported an IIP3 of −11 dBm and power
consumption of 21.1 mW from a supply of 1.1 V.

and thus gain. The ﬁrst two stages were powered from a voltage supply of 2 V and
the last two stages used a lower supply of 1 V to keep the overall power con-
sumption low. Matching networks were realized using microstrip lines of metals 1
and 2 connected with the backside metal chosen as the reference ground. Note that
by connecting the sources of the transistors using backside vias inherently intro-
duced inductive source degeneration, owing to the inductive behavior of these vias.
Blocking capacitors were realized as MIM capacitors. All matching networks were
optimized using an EM simulator.
The ampliﬁer achieved 28 dB gain from 62 to 77 GHz. The measured minimum
noise ﬁgure was 3 dB, albeit outside the band of interest, at 80 GHz. Over the band
of interest, however, an average noise ﬁgure of 4.5 dB was achieved. The measured
power consumption was 44 mW.

A Q/V-Band pHEMT GaAs Low-Noise Ampliﬁer
with Noise Figure Less Than 2 dB
Alternatively, other technologies can be used to reach very low noise ﬁgures.
Pantoli et al. [20] demonstrated a wideband LNA in 0.1 lm GaAs pHMET tech-
nology that reached a noise ﬁgure lower than 2 dB. The LNA is meant to operate
between 40 and 51 GHz.
The circuit diagram of this three-stage common-source LNA is shown in
Fig. 7.24. The common source conﬁgurations were chosen as a compromise
between noise, gain and power handling, and with the aim to maintain low power
consumption. Matching networks were designed as RC networks that use tapered
transmission lines as well as stubs, thus avoiding the use of spiral inductors. The
input matching network and the ﬁrst interstage network were optimized for noise
performance. Similarly, the input transistor was sized for the minimum noise ﬁgure.
On the other hand, the second interstage network and the output network were
optimized for gain and linearity. Furthermore, the output network included the
modeled effects of the bond wire and the pad. Lastly, ensuring the stability of the
ampliﬁer was one of the crucial aspects of this research.

The measured results showed a gain of 16.5 dB over 11 GHz of bandwidth. The
measured noise ﬁgure was less than 2 dB over the band of interest, which con-
stitutes one of the lowest noise ﬁgures seen in this chapter. The total power con-
sumption was measured to 80 mW and recorded OIP3 was 15 dBm.
7.3.8
A 68–110-GHz InP HEMT Common-Gate Low-Noise
Ampliﬁer
None of the LNA conﬁgurations explored up to now has utilized a common-gate
conﬁguration. The common-gate conﬁguration is typically used to achieve large
bandwidths, but the implementation in inexpensive technologies such as CMOS
and BiCMOS is challenging. This may not be of much concern in other tech-
nologies, such as InP HEMT technology, as demonstrated by Sato et al. [21]. The
technology used in this paper deployed 80-nm transistors with fT = 380 GHz and
fMAX = 283 GHz.
A speciﬁc challenge in common-gate LNAs is encountered when cascading the
ampliﬁer stages. Because of the smaller value of gain that can be achieved with
the common-gate ampliﬁer when compared with the common-source ampliﬁer, the
common-gate ﬁrst stage is typically followed by one or more common-source
stages. In this case, even though the common-gate conﬁguration can achieve good
bandwidth ﬁgures, the bandwidth becomes limited by the bandwidth of the
common-source conﬁgurations. To overcome this, the authors of this paper pro-
posed cascading three common-gate stages, but placing the focus on the output
matching of each individual stage to 50 X. With this strategy, the output of 50 X is
perfectly matched to the input of 50 X associated with common-gate transistor
ampliﬁers and described in previous chapters. This is accomplished through the
insertion of a spiral inductor of value L between common-gate stages, as illustrated
in Fig. 7.25. Gates of the transistors are biased through short transmission line
sections of length lcg. Instability is avoided by choosing lcg to be as short as
possible. Furthermore, bias RF chokes are necessary at the input of the ﬁrst stage
and the output of the last stage. The RF chokes also act as ESD protection.
The transmission lines utilized consisted of a thin-ﬁlm microstrip line with
characteristic impedance of 50 X. Inductors and RF chokes were implemented as

spiral inductors, which were able to achieve good Q-values at millimeter-wave
frequencies owing to the high resistivity of InP.
The measured results of the three-stage ampliﬁer showed an average noise ﬁgure
of 3.5 dB, a 3-dB bandwidth of 42 GHz between 68 and 110 GHz and a gain of
18 dB. Simulated results showed S11 and S22 values of less than −15 and −10 dB
respectively (corresponding to input and output matching). The power consumption
from the 3-V supply was 12 mW.
7.3.9
A 30-GHz-Wide Low-Noise Ampliﬁer Using
a Pole-Converging Interstage Bandwidth Extension
Technique
Reaching wideband operation in CMOS and BiCMOS is more challenging than in
other technologies. Wideband CMOS LNA conﬁgurations all deploy certain
techniques to extend the bandwidth of the ampliﬁer. Typically, a signiﬁcant
decrease in bandwidth in multi-stage conﬁgurations is seen in the inter-stage
matching networks. Feng et al. [22] propose an approach in which the poles of the
matching networks are converged on the locus diagram of poles and zeros, until the
gain-frequency response is sufﬁciently ﬂat.
The circuit diagram in Fig. 7.26a shows an alternative version of the cascode
ampliﬁer. In this circuit, the common-gate ampliﬁer is connected to VDD via a gate
inductor Lg2. The gate inductor serves to cancel out the parasitic quantities asso-
ciated with the transistor M2. In fact, if a small inductor value is inserted, another
peak in the frequency response of the gain of the ampliﬁer is introduced, spaced far
away in the frequency domain, as illustrated in Fig. 7.27. This is due to an addi-
tional set of the complex conjugate poles (p5 and p6) and zeros (z4 and z5)
appearing in the locus diagram of the ampliﬁer, as illustrated in Fig. 7.28 (other
poles and zeros appear irrespective of the presence of this inductor). As the value of

the gate inductor increases, however, the complex poles and zeros are brought
closer to the locus origin, which in turn brings the second peak in the frequency
response closer to the original peak resulting from the dominant pole. With Lg2
sufﬁciently large, p5 (or alternatively, p6) is brought close enough to p1 (p2)
(Fig. 7.28) so that they both dominate the frequency response resulting in the
bandwidth extension, albeit with large ripple. The ripple is, however, not ideal for
LNAs, as one of the main requirements is a ﬂat gain response. An additional
problem that appears is the compromised stability of the ampliﬁer.

Fortunately, gain ﬂattening can be achieved by using feedback. Feedback is
known to reduce the gain of the ampliﬁer, the effect of which is beneﬁcial in this
conﬁguration. In the conﬁguration of Fig. 7.26a, the feedback can be introduced by
inserting a series inductor Ls2 placed between the drain of M1 and the source of M2,
and further conﬁguring inductors Ls2 and Ld2 as a transformer with a coupling
coefﬁcient k. This is illustrated in Fig. 7.26b. The beneﬁts of standalone inductors
Ls2 and Ld2 were discussed earlier in the book (the former increases the fT of the
cascode structure and the latter extends the bandwidth due to peaking), but coupling
allows the negative feedback current to ﬂow in Ld2 through magnetic coupling. This
results in faster charging of the load capacitor, which additionally extends the
bandwidth of the stage. This can be seen by once again inspecting the locus of poles
and zeros (Fig. 7.29) and the frequency response of the gain (Fig. 7.30). In the
locus diagram, it can be noted that p1 and p2 move away from the imaginary axes
and p5 and p6 move towards the imaginary axes, which increases the magnitude of
the frequency response at the second dominant pole, thus bringing the magnitudes
of the two pairs of complex conjugate poles in line. The stability of this ampliﬁer
can be ensured if the transformer coupling coefﬁcient values are kept moderate.
The effectiveness of this technique was demonstrated by fabricating and mea-
suring the performance of the three-stage LNA circuit built in a 65 nm CMOS
technology. The simpliﬁed circuit diagram is shown in Fig. 7.31. The ﬁrst stage of
the LNA is matched to the source via a parallel LC matching network, where Lg1
(gate-matching inductor) and Ls1 (source-degeneration inductor) are also coupled in
a transformer conﬁguration. This matching network allows for the parasitic
capacitances of the input pad to be resonated out and it ensures that the bandwidth
is not compromised at the input while, as expected, keeping the noise ﬁgure low.
The further two stages do not deploy inductive source degeneration. In addition, the
last stage deploys a split drain inductor, with the two halves also conﬁgured as a
transformer. In the circuit layout, all transformers are deployed in a stacked

0.4. Standalone inductors were similarly deployed in the topmost metal.
Measured S-parameters are shown in Fig. 7.32. The proposed LNA achieved the
maximum gain of 13.3 dB gain at 69 GHz, with 30 GHz of bandwidth between
62.5 and 92.5 GHz. The average noise ﬁgure is 6.8 dB with a minimum value of
5.5 dB at 90 GHz. The LNA draws 15.2 mA of current from a 1.8-V supply, but
the power consumption can be constrained to 12 mW with a supply of 1.2 V at the
expense of an increased noise ﬁgure and a small reduction in bandwidth.

A 190-GHz BiCMOS Low-Noise Ampliﬁer
for Ultra-Large Bandwidth Applications
Achieving ultra-wide bandwidth at millimeter-wave frequencies remains one of the
most complex challenges. Most of the conﬁgurations presented up to now have
bandwidths that are 10–20 GHz wide, with the exception of the previous conﬁg-
uration, which reaches 30 GHz. Fritsche et al. [23] focused their research on
ultra-large bandwidth receivers and demonstrated an LNA capable of supporting
over 40 GHz of bandwidth around 190 GHz. The LNA presented in this paper was
designed and optimized for a receiver supporting higher-order modulation schemes
capable of reaching 35 GHz of bandwidth overall. Furthermore, all of this was
achieved in 130 nm BiCMOS technology, optimized for sub-terahertz application.
The feature device of this technology is the high-performance HBT, which can
reach an fT value of 450 GHz, while the experimental results show fMAX of
430 GHz. Both of these values are higher than in other BiCMOS technologies
considered in this chapter. In addition, the high thickness and the positioning of the
top metal layer in the vertical dimension enable implementation of high-Q trans-
mission lines and MIM capacitors, as well as high characteristic impedance
transmission lines for broadband matching networks.
The proposed LNA is shown in Fig. 7.33 and consists of two matched cascode
stages. The LNA was, naturally, optimized for a low noise ﬁgure and the power
match at the input, but the optimization was performed to further justify the number
of devices in parallel that build the cascode. This is commonly referred to as the
device multiplier (m), also shown in the ﬁgure. Simulations showed that m = 2 for
both Q1 and Q2 yields the best performance. Load-pull simulations were used to
similarly optimize the output cascode stage for maximum available output power;
this resulted in value m = 4 for transistors Q3 and Q4. This optimization also

resulted in sufﬁcient linearity. The interstage and the output matching networks
deployed a double-matching approach in order to broaden the bandwidth.
The simulations of the LNA showed a power gain of 17 dB over more than
40 GHz of bandwidth with a noise ﬁgure of 9.4 dB. The receiver circuit was
fabricated and showed a noise ﬁgure of 10.7 dB and consumed 122 mW of power.
The
already
disclosed
overall
bandwidth
of
35 GHz
gives
a
very
high
percentage-bandwidth ﬁgure of 18.4%.

Other Conﬁgurations
Two more conﬁgurations were already presented in Chap. 6. As described in
Sect. 6.6, Fritsche et al. [24] presented a two-stage LNA designed in 28-nm CMOS,
achieving 13.8 dB of power gain over 18 GHz of bandwidth centered on the
60 GHz band with a power consumption of 24 mW and a noise ﬁgure of 4 dB. This
conﬁguration was depicted in Fig. 6.19.
Feng et al. [25] presented a ﬁve-stage 88.5-110 GHz LNA in 65-nm CMOS
technology achieving a gain of 16.7 dB and a noise ﬁgure of 7.2 dB with a power
consumption of 48.6 mW. This conﬁguration was depicted in Fig. 6.20.

7.3.13
Weaknesses of the State-of-the-Art Conﬁguration
Several weaknesses of conﬁgurations reported in this section are all related to
circuit complexity.
To achieve a good noise ﬁgure, high gain, good linearity, wide bandwidth and
high
frequency
operation
simultaneously,
researchers
need
to
resort
to
“out-of-the-box” thinking and innovative design ideas. The circuits often involve a
large number of stages and complex impedance matching. Design using ﬁrst
principles is often abandoned, once more because of complexity, and iterative
simulations are relied upon. Although some LNA conﬁgurations are fairly similar to
others, there is a distinct lack of a recipe for the design of repeatable LNAs.
Complexity also typically increases the power consumption ﬁgures, unless the
design is tending to the lower boundary of the millimeter-wave band. In addition,
with an increase in frequency, CMOS and BiCMOS technologies are often pushed
to their limits. More advanced technologies, such as GaAs and InP HEMT tech-
nologies or BiCMOS optimized for THz operation additionally increase the cost of
circuit fabrication.
Complex conﬁgurations can also be used to reach frequencies above 200 GHz,
but this often comes with a sacriﬁce in bandwidth. This is the topic of the following
section.
7.4
State-of-the-Art Conﬁgurations Reaching Beyond
200 GHz
Complex cascades of LNA stages are also required to reach very high frequencies,
even if wide bandwidth is not required. This section presents a number of such
conﬁgurations.
7.4.1
A 245 GHz Narrowband BiCMOS Low-Noise
Ampliﬁer
With most of the LNA conﬁgurations presented in this book designed to operate at
sub-100 GHz, an LNA operating at 245 GHz almost comes as a surprise. Schmalz
et al. [27], however, identiﬁed a need for an LNA for short-range distance sensor
applications, which could operate in the 2 GHz-wide ISM band around 245 GHz.
The LNA was demonstrated in the 130 nm BiCMOS technology with fT of
300 GHz. It was deployed as a ﬁve-stage cascade of transformer-coupled cascode
LNAs, as illustrated in Fig. 7.34.
Stages were coupled by baluns at the input and the output and separated by
transformers. Stages marked “B” deployed weak emitter degeneration for stability,
240
7
State-of-the-Art Low-Noise Ampliﬁers …

while stages marked “A” had no emitter degeneration. Transformers were imple-
mented in the top two metals of the process (thicknesses of 2 and 3 lm), and EM
simulations showed an insertion loss of only 2 dB. The layout of the transformer
structure and the simulation results with termination capacitance of 10 fF are shown
in Fig. 7.35, where the S21 of the transformer is also shown. The middle tap of the
primary windings is connected to the VCC through a stack of metals, shown as a
resistor in Fig. 7.34. The chip photo of the LNA is shown in Fig. 7.36.
The ﬁve-stage ampliﬁer demonstrated 18.4 dB maximum gain at 244.5 GHz.
This is illustrated in Fig. 7.37, where the measured input and output losses are also
shown. The average noise ﬁgure of 11 dB was reached (Fig. 7.38), which is higher
than the NFmin of the transistor; however, this was attributed to the noise contri-
butions of the ﬁrst stage cascode, subsequent stages and the losses in the input
balun. Nevertheless, this paper demonstrated one of the lowest noise ﬁgures
reached at this frequency.
The complete receiver utilizing this LNA with the measured 21 dB gain was
demonstrated by the same group [28].

7.4.2
160–270 GHz InP HEMT Low-Noise Ampliﬁers
The InP HEMT technology is also suitable for wideband LNA implementation
above 200 GHz. Varonen et al. [29] presented two conﬁgurations that can operate
between 160 and 270 GHz in a technology with an fMAX value of 1 THz and
minimum gate length of 35 nm. This technology also comes with high quality MIM
capacitors and thin-ﬁlm resistors.
The ﬁrst LNA is a four-stage ampliﬁer depicted in Fig. 7.39. The ampliﬁer
utilizes source degeneration in each stage to ensure stability. Matching is completed
using series transmission lines and short-circuited shunt stubs. The second LNA
deploys three stages instead of four, with the last stage in Fig. 7.39 replaced by a
cascode stage depicted in Fig. 7.40. This increases reverse isolation and output

LNA reported in [27].

impedance, albeit with some decrease in the noise ﬁgure. Stability of the
common-gate-conﬁgured transistor in the cascode is ensured by inserting a
high-impedance
transmission
line
between
the
common-source
and
the
common-gate transistors, as well as an open-shunt transmission line at the output of
the cascode stage. A small-sized MIM capacitor was used for gate grounding.
In both ampliﬁers, grounded coplanar waveguides were used in the transmission
line implementation. Ampliﬁers achieve 15–25 dB of gain from 160 to 270 GHz.
Furthermore, the measurements on the four-stage ampliﬁer show a noise ﬁgure of
7–8 dB from 220 to 252 GHz at room temperature and packaged in the WR3
waveguide housing. Both LNAs can operate at cryogenic temperatures for the
decreased noise ﬁgure.

7.4.3
A Common-Source and Cascode MHEMT Low-Noise
Ampliﬁer for Applications at 325 GHz
Diebold et al. [30] proposed two conﬁgurations of LNAs for 325-GHz radiometric
applications. Both LNAs used 35-nm mHEMT transistors capable of achieving
fT = 515 GHz, fMAX = 900 GHz and a transconductance gm = 2800 mS/mm. The
process also allowed for air bridges and MIM capacitors.
The ﬁrst conﬁguration was a seven-stage common-source LNA, where the
simpliﬁed schematic of one stage is shown in Fig. 7.41. The second conﬁguration
was the ﬁve-stage cascode conﬁguration, with the schematic of one stage shown in
Fig. 7.42. In each conﬁguration, each stage was matched to 50 X at both the input
and the output. CPWs were used for routing and matching.
The common-source LNA showed over 23.5-dB measured gain over 50 GHz
bandwidth centered from 294 to 344 GHz. The simulated minimum noise ﬁgure
was 7.1 dB at 325 GHz. The cascode conﬁguration, on the other hand, showed a
30 GHz gain at 325 GHz, a 3-dB bandwidth from 301 to 314 GHz and a simulated
noise ﬁgure of 5.9 dB at 325 GHz.

7.4.4
A 670 GHz InP HEMT Low-Noise Ampliﬁer
The InP HEMT technology allows for LNAs to be researched even at
submillimeter-wave frequencies. Deal et al. [31] reported an LNA reaching
670 GHz using transistors with fMAX values of 1.5 THz. The process is tailored for
submillimeter-wave operation, with transistors that have modiﬁed layout to mini-
mize extrinsic parasitics and a scaled 25-nm gate.
A microphotograph of the LNA is shown in Fig. 7.43. The ampliﬁer consists of
eight 12 lm transistor stages. The interstage matching is done such that the drain
and the following gate are connected using a short series of CPW line and a short

shunt CPW line, as well as a bypass capacitor. Furthermore, each stage is separately
optimized. At the input and the output, additional open-circuited stubs are added to
provide additional matching to 50 X. The LNA is mounted in waveguide housings.
The measured LNA achieves a gain of approximately 17 dB centered at
675 GHz. 13 dB gain is observed at 600 GHz and 12 dB is gain is observed at
700 GHz. Noise measurements show that the noise ﬁgure is between 9.4 and
9.9 dB over 15 GHz centered at 670 GHz, as shown in Fig. 7.44. This is consid-
ered an improvement over the similar, albeit ﬁve-stage, 670-GHz 30-nm InP HEMT
LNA reported in [32] (Fig. 7.45), which had 8 dB gain and a noise ﬁgure of 13 dB.

7.4.6
Weaknesses of the State-of-the Art Conﬁguration
The main weakness of the current state-of-the-art LNA conﬁgurations that reach
frequencies of 200 GHz and beyond is the cost of fabrication, particularly if
advanced technologies such as pHEMT are used. When BiCMOS is used, the
technology is stretched to its limit. Lack of consistent modeling was also observed.
Furthermore, the noise ﬁgures achieved are much higher than those observed at
lower frequencies. The power consumption ﬁgure also increases drastically owing
to the circuit complexity, but is often not reported by the authors, as it is clearly
distanced from being a primary concern.
However, the conﬁgurations presented are enough of an indication that it is
possible to design LNAs in the whole millimeter-wave band; however, additional
research into conﬁgurations, modeling, technologies or even measurement tech-
niques is required.
7.5
Low-Noise Ampliﬁer Optimization
As this chapter progressed and conﬁgurations presented grew ever more complex, it
became evident that simultaneous optimization of more than two or three LNA
performance parameters at millimeter-wave frequencies becomes increasingly dif-
ﬁcult. Even though the LNA design theory (explored in Chaps. 5 and 6) does not
differ between lower frequencies (RF and microwave) and the millimeter-wave
spectrum, the ﬁgures obtained in practice are consistently worse than predicted.
This discrepancy is often evident when simulation results are compared with
measurement results. This, therefore, leaves much potential for investigation of
further optimization of LNA conﬁgurations presented.

State-of-the-Art Low-Noise Ampliﬁers …

Various directions into optimization have already been touched on. It is clear
that more advanced technologies allow for lower parasitics or better quality pas-
sives. Circuit interconnects and packaging, for example, also inﬂuence the LNA
performance. Passives themselves often have some room for optimization with the
aid of, for example, innovative layout techniques. Therefore, several ways to
improve the millimeter-wave LNAs of the future involve dedicated technology,
passives and packaging research, as well as some related research activities such as
interconnect and package modeling. Therefore, Chap. 8 will propose several
improvements in these interrelated ﬁelds.
New technologies and packaging are, however, not always available to designers
and the most suitable components could already be deployed. However, it could
still be possible to optimize and improve the performance of reviewed topologies if
the “black-magic” approach consisting typically of trial-and-error design and
repetitive simulations is replaced by an automated algorithmic approach. This
approach relies on EDA and computational intelligence to exploit the available
components in the best possible way. In addition to being able to aid in optimizing
LNAs and passive devices, this approach introduces a portion of a streamlined ﬂow
in a typical iterative LNA and receiver design cycle. Therefore, several such ideas
are proposed in Chap. 9.
7.6
Concluding Remarks
In this chapter, state-of-the-art conﬁgurations in the ﬁeld of millimeter-wave
low-noise ampliﬁcation were explored. The bulk of this chapter was dedicated to a
number of multistage wideband conﬁgurations which, by deploying innovative
ideas, were able to achieve respectable noise ﬁgures, high gain and acceptable
linearity, spanning wide frequency ranges. Some complex conﬁgurations were also
shown to reach frequencies over 200 GHz. However, not all parameters were ever
optimized at the same time, and for most of these conﬁgurations, certain weak-
nesses could be identiﬁed. It is often possible to improve upon such weaknesses,
and some introductory discussions on LNA optimization were conducted at the end
of the chapter.
LNA optimization was, however, not the main focus here. These discussions are
carried over to Chaps. 8 and 9. The following chapter, Chap. 8, will engage in a
discussion of other advanced LNA optimization topics, such as modeling, pack-
aging, advanced fabrication techniques and minimizing parasitic effects.

Chapter 8
Advanced Low-Noise Ampliﬁer
Optimization Topics
Abstract This chapter deals with advanced LNA optimization topics. It opens with
some general considerations that need to be understood and addressed early in the
LNA design ﬂow as a ﬁrst step in reaching optimum LNA operation. The second
part of the chapter deals with LNA optimization through improved packaging.
Advanced fabrication technologies is discussed in the third part. Some attempts at
minimizing the passive parasitic effects and increasing the Q-factors of passives that
can be proposed for the millimeter-wave frequency are considered in the fourth part
of the chapter.
Chapter 7 identiﬁed some weaknesses in the state-of-the-art situation in the ﬁeld of
millimeter-wave LNAs. Typically, these weaknesses were overcome by the cited
authors themselves. However, there is still much room for improvement in LNA
operation, and Chaps. 8 and 9 tackle the topics of LNA optimization. While Chap. 9
looks at optimization from the perspective of the EDA, this chapter, Chap. 8, looks
at some advanced optimization topics. In low-frequency design, most of the con-
siderations listed here are typically ignored, as they do not generally have much
inﬂuence on the circuit operation. However, as frequency increases, these concerns
become increasingly important and the best practice is trying to eliminate or
minimize their inﬂuence from the start. Concerns such as component and insertion
loss, coupling, inﬂuence of tracks, lines, packaging and bonding and the importance
of proper layout are all easily overlooked.
At millimeter-wave frequencies, the ﬁrst solution to underperforming LNAs is to
look at advanced processing techniques. Circuit technologies were already dis-
cussed in Chap. 3, but in this chapter, some current as well as future directions that
could help alleviate millimeter-wave circuit problems faced today will be discussed.
Using advanced processing nodes might still not be enough to reach the desired
performance because of underperforming passives. Constant efforts are being made
to improve the quality factors of passives for millimeter-wave operation, as detailed
in Chap. 4. Although every process node with increasing fT values generally allows
for implementation of higher quality passives, there is still some room for
improvement of passives by looking for innovative ways to implement them.

Constant striving towards advanced process nodes and high-quality passive
components, as described in Chaps. 3 and 4, is not the only important factor in
integrated circuit operation; one needs to strive constantly towards new packaging
solutions to complement these two, otherwise the design efforts could be wasted.
Traditional packaging, as used for low-frequency operation, is typically not sufﬁ-
cient for millimeter-wave applications and new packaging techniques geared for
millimeter-wave circuits need to be considered. Alternatives can also be sought by
looking at SoP and related technologies, mentioned in Chap. 4, the packaging
techniques that are becoming increasingly popular because they allow for the
integration of dies fabricated in various technologies, as well as passive compo-
nents, in the same package.
This chapter will deal with all the topics mentioned above. It will open with
some general considerations that need to be understood and addressed early in the
LNA design ﬂow as a ﬁrst step in reaching optimum LNA operation. The second
part of the chapter will deal with LNA optimization through improved packaging.
Advanced fabrication technologies will be discussed in the third part. Some
attempts at minimizing the passive parasitic effects and increasing the Q-factors of
passives that can be proposed for the millimeter-wave frequency will be considered
in the fourth part of the chapter.
8.1
General Considerations Leading to Optimum
Low-Noise Ampliﬁer Designs
In this section, some easily overlooked general considerations for millimeter-wave
LNAs will be discussed. Most of these considerations are applicable to integrated
and discrete LNA implementation, although, as seen in earlier chapters, integrated
or
SoP
solutions
are
typically
the
solutions
that

more
sense
at
millimeter-wave frequencies, rather than their discrete counterparts [1], and there
are therefore additional considerations for integrated implementations.
8.1.1
Component and Interstage Connection Losses
An important aspect to consider when designing LNAs is the component loss. The
theory used in the LNA analysis typically involves system components. In practice,
various components (e.g. the inductors or the transmission lines) will experience
some loss. Thus the overall efﬁciency and therefore the gain of the LNA stage will
be less than what was predicted by calculations.
With correct modeling of components, accurate simulations can be performed on
the ﬁnal system to determine the loss mechanisms. Proper modeling of components
needs to be ensured before attempting any simulations. This is achieved by utilizing
254

Advanced Low-Noise Ampliﬁer Optimization Topics

specialized EDA simulation tools, such as the EM simulators discussed brieﬂy later
in Chap. 9. Inductors are typically the components that are expected to contribute
greatly to system loss and they must be modeled such that their ﬁnite Q-factor is
catered for; however, as the frequency increases, as seen in Chap. 4, the loss of
other passives (e.g. capacitors) also has to be modeled. The approach to minimizing
losses of passive components can be the same as that taken for spiral inductors later
in Chap. 9.
Additional losses could occur when connecting various LNA ampliﬁcation
stages. As seen in the previous chapter, interstage matching is typically deployed,
and care needs to be taken to counter losses introduced in the matching networks
correctly. The overall LNA gain will thus be decreased by the amount of loss (in
dB) introduced by these networks.
8.1.2
Uncertainty
With millimeter-wave integrated applications demanding advanced process nodes
for circuit fabrication, risks associated with advanced node fabrication need to be
accepted [2]. These risks include issues such as reliability and uncertainty in
electrical behavior that are directly associated with silicon complexity. Uncertainty
normally arises due to parasitics, such as resistances and capacitances associated
with wiring and interconnects, as well as coupling between neighboring conductors
(described in more detail later). Unwanted behavior of the circuit usually only
manifests itself when the physical design has been fabricated because of lack of
observability of a number of physical effects during the design stage.
The best way to overcome problems associated with uncertainty are to perform
electrically aware design using specialized EDA tools and methodology (EDA is
the topic of Chap. 9). Where this is not possible, an alternative approach is to
overdesign the circuit to compensate for the uncertain losses, which is a common
practice with predictable (certain) losses of less advanced technologies.
8.1.3
Feasibility of Component Values
In some scenarios, component values calculated based on the speciﬁcations for the
LNA system can become difﬁcult to reach in practice. As a result, the value of each
component needs to be evaluated carefully and it needs to be decided whether such
a component can be used in a given implementation, or whether the design spec-
iﬁcations need to be reevaluated or an alternative topology or approach is required.
This problem is typically less prominent in discrete implementations, where a
speciﬁc design could result in component values that are different from standard
component values. In practice, this is easily overcome, since components can
typically be combined until the desired value is found. In preferred integrated
8.1
General Considerations Leading to Optimum Low-Noise Ampliﬁer Designs
255

implementations, a typical problem that could arise is that excessively large (or
small) capacitors and/or inductors could be required, leading to integration prob-
lems. The solution is typically sought in redesign, alternative topology, using a
different component (e.g. using a bond wire or a transmission line instead of a spiral
inductor), or, as a last resort, using components (for example, a large inductor)
external to the chip. In fact, it is very rare that integrated receivers can work without
any off-chip components.
In the case of a matching network, an alternative matching network requiring
feasible components can often be found. In certain cases, the component values
could dictate whether integrated, discrete or combined implementation is required.
Thus, the choice of implementation has to be made not only from the viewpoint of
given speciﬁcations, but also from the viewpoint of passives.
8.1.4
Inﬂuence of the Frequency and the Wavelength
Throughout this book it was seen that the wavelength at millimeter-wave fre-
quencies introduces several advantages, such as the ability to integrate transmission
lines or antennas on chip. However, operating at such extremes introduces many
more disadvantages.
The problem that is very easily overlooked is the fact that every wire and every
track has a tendency to turn into a transmission line and to introduce some para-
sitics. The importance of modeling all components (especially passives) at
increased frequency has already been stressed; however, the inductive behavior of
the wire, for example, needs to be included in all the analyses in the
millimeter-wave regime. Experience shows, on the other hand, that the best practice
is to minimize any wire and track lengths. An alternative approach is to use the
parasitics in the design by absorbing them in wanted passive calculations. Still, all
simulations have to be performed with parasitics in mind.
An additional concern is maintaining maximum power transfer (in addition to
minimal noise, which is by far the most important concern in LNAs). To avoid
implementing any additional matching networks, care needs to be taken to keep any
tracks to about 1/10 of the wavelength.
Naturally, another concern that can be mentioned is the maximum frequency of
operation that can be reached for a given fT. Therefore, the feasibility of the design
at the particular frequency also needs to be determined prior to executing the design
in the required frequency band.
8.1.5
Coupling
Analog, particularly RF, circuitry is subject to unwanted signal coupling. Unwanted
coupling adds to the noise ﬁgure. The signals can couple from adjacent signal
256

Advanced Low-Noise Ampliﬁer Optimization Topics

routing lines, through passives electromagnetically, or via the substrate [3]. As the
circuit density increases (which is the case in advanced process nodes), the problem
with coupling becomes more prominent. Dummy metal ﬁlls that are used in ﬁnal
layout preparation to ensure the metal density requirements or speciﬁed by foun-
dries for the purpose of eliminating the metal sagging problem, often introduce
additional coupling [4].
Most of the noise problems due to coupling are due to capacitive coupling from
one circuit node to another, because a capacitor appears whenever one lead runs
alongside or crosses another [5]. The amount of coupling energy increases with the
increase in frequency. Ampliﬁer inputs are particularly sensitive to coupling.
Therefore, when performing the design and considering component placement, it
should be done with coupling in mind. This usually calls for shielding of sensitive
signals. Shielding is done by introducing additional signal lines with low noise and
low impedance. Power lines or grounds are types of signals that can serve as
shields. Shielding for signals deployed in common metal layers and different metal
layers is illustrated in Fig. 8.1. An additional approach to ensuring that sensitive
lines are protected is never to run the sensitive signals for longer distances than
absolutely necessary. This means that the sensitive signals should be routed ﬁrst,
after which all the other signals are routed; furthermore, component placement
should be carried out such that blocks with sensitive interconnects are placed
closely together.
Substrate-induced noise is typically handled by introducing noiseless ground
planes, or isolating sensitive components from the substrate.

8.1.6
Design Rule Checks and Technology Considerations
When designing LNAs in integrated technologies, the design has to be performed
with the speciﬁc technology and its design rules in mind. This is important for both
active and passive devices. For active devices, the maximum size of the transistor
(viz. the emitter length in BJTs or number of ﬁngers in MOS transistors) could
impose a restriction on the active devices. For passive components, it is important
to stick to the design rule checks (DRC) rules. Typically, the minimum metal
spacing would determine the pitch between each turn of the spiral inductors.
Additional inductor placement considerations have already been discussed in
Chap. 4 [5]. Rules could also, for example, dictate how closely together the
capacitor ﬁngers can be placed from each other or from other components.
8.1.7
Layout Dependency
In advanced process nodes and particularly when working with sensitive RF and
millimeter-wave circuits, it is no longer sufﬁcient just to preform corner or Monte
Carlo analysis. Depending on where the active devices are placed, layout-dependent
effects also need to be investigated. These include, for example, how the multiple
ﬁngers are interdigitated, the distance of an active device from the well edge, or the
distance between different active regions. These could have a direct impact on the
mobility or threshold voltage, with variations of up to 80%.
Two effects typically arise in technologies with a feature size of 130 nm and
below: stress due to shallow trench isolation (STI) and well proximity effects
(WPE) [2]. Stress is intentionally introduced in nMOS transistors (tensile stress)
and pMOS transistors (pushing stress) to increase electron and hole mobility.
However, STI can introduce an amount of unwanted stress, and care needs to be
taken that the transistors are properly isolated.
WPE is a source of variability resulting from the location of transistors in
relation to the well boundaries. Figure 8.2a shows the trend seen in the typical
threshold voltage dependence on the location (distance) of the transistor from the
well boundary [2]. Consequently, the gain curve of the typical ampliﬁer takes the
shape illustrated in Fig. 8.2b.
The layout also has to be done with heating in mind. Different transistors suffer
from different heating issues, but there are layout techniques that can be used to
minimize this effect.
It is therefore becoming increasingly critical to account for the layout effects
early in the LNA design cycle. This should include cell planning and module
planning, as well as route planning and placement.

8.1.8
Bond-Pad Considerations
Bonding pads need to be placed on the layout of integrated circuits in order to
connect the internal IC signal to the bond wire, which then connects to the package
on the other side, as illustrated in Fig. 8.3. A bond pad typically consists of several
layers of metals and vias for integrity purposes. As a result, bond pads will
introduce parasitics that have to be modeled and included in the design and the
simulation of the complete packaged LNA system. Typically, the behavior of the
bond pad is capacitive.
Furthermore, ICs, and to much greater extent, SoP circuits are prone to ESD.
ESD is introduced via bonding pads, being the part of the circuit that communicates
with the external world. To cater for ESD, ESD protection circuitry is typically
placed on the pads. Although ESD protection circuitry, typically incorporating
diodes, is designed such that it does not inﬂuence the normal functioning of the

circuits, it more often than not introduces unwanted parasitics, which need to be
catered for in the design. In LNAs, the ESD protection circuitry is connected to the
sensitive signal coming from the antenna, as illustrated in Fig. 8.4 [6]. The overall
noise ﬁgure of the LNA with ESD protection can be estimated as
Ftotal ¼ FESD þ FLNA;
ð8:1Þ
assuming the negligible inﬂuence of the blocks after the ﬁrst LNA stage.
8.1.9
Bond-Wire Considerations
Bond wires retain their use in millimeter-wave applications because bonding is the
least expensive way of connecting the inside circuitry (pads) to the outside world.
The bond wire was shown to be inductive in Chap. 4. In low-frequency designs, the
inﬂuence of bond wires is typically negligible and they can be modeled as short
circuits (i.e. can be ignored). With increasing frequencies, however, bond wires
should be modeled with an inductor-resistor series model and included in simula-
tions. The best practice for these designs is to use the bond wire parasitics in
calculations. One possible approach is to use the bond wire inductance in the actual
circuit design (e.g. the gate inductor of the ﬁrst LNA stage). It should be noted,
however, that bond wires introduce additional tolerances on the inductance value
and this can only be done if the system can allow for this increase.
8.1.10
Package Leads Considerations
Packaging of ICs and systems is needed to protect the die and other components
from external inﬂuences. Typical packages have leads in the lead frame, which

provide the physical framework and electrical connections from the IC to the PCB
or another system outside the IC [7]. Because of the length of the package leads,
they also introduce parasitics and therefore should also be taken into consideration
when doing the LNA design or performing simulations [8].
Leads are typically made of copper, aluminum or various alloys (e.g. alloy42),
all having high conductivity. As such, leads mostly exhibit inductive behavior, but
this obviously depends on the type of package used. The package models are now
becoming commonly available to designers because of the ever-increasing need for
accurate simulation and modeling [9], particularly as millimeter-wave circuitry
becomes popular. Figure 8.5 shows two packages. The package in Fig. 8.5a has
long leads and is typically geared for low-frequency operation, whereas the package
in Fig. 8.5b is more suitable for millimeter-wave and has very short leads, allowing
for tight mounting on the PCB. The ﬁrst package is known as a dual-in-line pin with
14 pins (DIP14) package, and the second package is known as a quad ﬂat no-leads
package with 64 leads (QFN64).
One of the possible solutions to compensate for the gain loss that is expected
because of packaging and otherwise is to design for somewhat higher gains than
required [10]. In fact, this approach can be used to compensate for bond-pad or
bond-wire parasitics if needed. This will obviously not compensate for the distor-
tion from the ideal waveforms that may arise owing to packaging [11]. The

technique called IC/package co-design, where circuitry is designed together with
the package, is emerging as an alternative to separate design of integrated circuits
and packages. Packaging will be discussed in more detail in the following section.
8.2
Optimization Through Improved Packaging
As seen in the previous section, packaging introduces unwanted parasitics and
losses, which decrease the performance metrics of packaged solutions, but is nec-
essary to protect the fragile integrated circuit from external inﬂuences, such as
mechanical and environmental stress and thermal effects.
In this section, some recent packaging advances, whether advances in actual
packaging technologies or advances with respect to what is packaged, are pre-
sented. These techniques can be deployed for millimeter-wave LNAs as a way of
optimizing wanted designs.
8.2.1
Wafer-Level Chip-Scale Packaging (Microbumping)
One way of improving a typical LNA design, irrespective of the topology, among
other circuits, is to remove the effects of bond wires and some packaging effects by
replacing bonding packages by the newer packaging technique called microbumping
[12]. The resulting package is called the ﬂip-chip package. In this interconnection
technique, the dies are ﬂipped around and placed face-down on the substrate and
solder microbumps make direct contact between the die and the substrate, after a
sufﬁcient amount of heat has been applied to melt the solder [2, 13].
As the microbumps are shorter and thicker than bond wires, such connections
have better signal integrity and power-carrying capability. An additional advantage
of this technique is that bonding pads can be placed anywhere on the chip, not
necessarily at the edge of the chip when working with bond wires. In addition,
signiﬁcant space can be saved because the package can be designed to be just
slightly larger than the actual die itself, therefore the alternative name for this
technology is wafer-level chip-scale packaging (WLSCP).
The concept of WLSCP is illustrated in Fig. 8.6.
Note that ﬂipping the chip in order to package the device using microbumps
does not come without disadvantages. A particular problem with LNA design is the
fact that when the chip is ﬂipped, passive components, particularly spiral inductors,
take up a position close to the substrate of the mounting PCB [14]. This means that
additional parasitics are introduced in the model of the inductor. Two mechanisms
are seen. The ﬁrst is the mutual coupling between the inductor and the PCB, and the
second is the additional capacitance between the spiral and the PCB. This requires
the spiral inductor model to be reconsidered if a ﬂip-chip package is deployed.

8.2.2
IC/Package Co-design
In millimeter-wave design, it is not suitable to design only the integrated circuits
(silicon); some effort needs to be invested in the design of packaging. This is
referred to as the IC/package co-design. This can be handled by using specialized
EDA tools and utilizing the packaging models provided by packaging manufac-
turers, and should ideally replace the guesswork involved in the process of
overdesign to compensate for the packaging and other effects.
In addition to the role of circuit protection, the package needs to be designed
such that it can serve as leverage for all the different components in the package; it
must maintain the integrity of signals entering and exiting the package and provide
the thermal sink to the overall system. Naturally, the application and the circuit size
will determine the type and size of the package, as well as the material used to build
the package.
8.2.3
System on Chip
System on chip refers to integrated implementations where only one die is placed in
the package, and there are no other components in the package external to the die.
This term is typically introduced to differentiate traditional ICs from SoP and
system in package (SiP), discussed in the following section. This concept is
illustrated in Fig. 8.7.

8.2.4
System on Package and System in Package
SoP was already brieﬂy discussed in Chap. 3 when discrete substrates were
addressed as an alternative to integrated technologies. If the functionality is parti-
tioned such that a system is designed with some components fabricated in the
integrated technologies with some components placed on a discrete substrate(s),
and everything is packaged together, a hybrid solution is created. Such a solution is
supposed to combine the advantages of both discrete and integrated worlds as well
as different technologies and is more formally known as SoP. The idea behind SoP
is that many system components can be designed in the same packaging, with
components placed closer together, allowing for shorter interconnects, which in turn
can decrease parasitic effects, ensure power and signal integrity and result in overall
improvement of performance [7, 15]. It is possible to mix process nodes as well as
discrete substrates.
A very similar concept to SoP is SiP. The former typically implies a mini-PCB
assembly with components on different substrates, and the latter a common sub-
strate for all components. A multi-chip package is a special case of SiP and SoP,
where the package contains several ICs and their interconnects only. System on
chip, where all components are placed on chip, has already been discussed and this
is typically referred to only as the chip. Various packaging options are shown in
Fig. 8.8.
With SoP, a compact microsystem can be realized without any material or
process limits and with increased ﬂexibility [16] and since all the components are
inside the package, the package has a much lower inﬂuence on the performance of
the system (i.e. only signals entering and exiting the whole system are inﬂuenced,
not
every
component).
SoP
is
becoming
increasingly
popular
in
mobile
applications.
In millimeter-wave systems, in addition to an unpackaged integrated die with
various systems, typical components that can be combined are antennas, capacitors,
inductors, waveguides, resistors, baluns, ﬁlters and MEMS components. Most of
the passive components can be fabricated on substrates different from silicon,
allowing for much greater Q-factors. RF metal structures can be fabricated on
ﬂexible low-temperature co-ﬁred ceramics, for example, as discussed in Chap. 3.
Waveguides, for example, can be designed with very low insertion losses [17].
Moreover, laminate technology is popular because it can achieve high performance
and low cost [13]. These components can typically be fabricated in the same way
their discrete counterparts are fabricated, but the size of the whole system is
decreased.

As all of these components are used with typical LNAs, SoC implementations
could be an important consideration for an LNA designer as well. In addition, at
millimeter-wave frequencies, shorter distances in SoP may allow for relaxed
matching considerations, but at the same time there may be more space for
transmission-line packaging (e.g. transmission line bends can be avoided). Circuits
other than LNAs can beneﬁt from even more possibilities, such as optoelectronic
circuitry, integrated heat sinks, etc.
SoP and SiP implementation also allows for the expansion of the layout into the
third dimension. In these implementations, dies are stacked together and connected
using a silicon interposer. The electrical connections are made using through-silicon
vias [18]. This concept is illustrated in Fig. 8.9.
The main challenges for LNA SoP designs include the necessity for accurate
modeling and optimization of active components, choice of substrate(s) for passive
fabrication and trying to minimize crosstalk, which come in addition to many other
concerns previously discussed common to all LNA implementations. The reliability
of the whole package also needs to be ensured, which becomes increasingly difﬁcult
because of the number of subsystems in one package. Connectivity between mul-
tiple dies can also sometimes be problematic because of the number of connections
that need to be made. General SoP devices could furthermore have a large pin

count, which complicates external connectivity. Simulation and veriﬁcation of these
complex systems present a signiﬁcant challenge as well. It should be noted that
SoP/SiP implementation is prone to variations in package that are greater than
silicon variations, which have a tendency to result in lower yield if not handled
properly.

8.2.5
Embedded Wafer Level Ball Grid Array Packaging
The embedded wafer level ball grid array (eWLB) is a packaging solution for
millimeter-wave applications using the same concept of microbumping as WLSCP
[19]. The main difference between eWLB and WLCSP packages is that in the case
of the former, the so-called fan-out area with a redistribution layer is placed around
the silicon dies, increasing the size of the package and opening space for placing
additional off-chip components and interconnects (Fig. 8.10). Strictly speaking,
eWLB can be classiﬁed as a type of SoP.
The carrier of the fan-out area is a mold compound that has outstanding electrical
properties that expand well into the millimeter-wave region of operation [20]. The

redistribution layer is typically a single copper layer. This is, however, sufﬁcient for
fabrication of low-loss transmission lines and high-Q passives, as well as other
circuitry, including antennas [19, 21]. Embedded passive components will be dis-
cussed later in this chapter.
8.3
Advanced Fabrication Techniques
The importance of fabrication technologies in the LNA design was already dis-
cussed in a dedicated chapter, Chap. 3. CMOS, HEMT and BiCMOS technologies
were established as capable of reaching millimeter-wave frequencies. What is
common to all of the said technologies is that research efforts constantly continue to
decrease the minimum feature size. The decrease of feature size in turn decreases
the value of parasitic components in designed circuits, and this then increases the
maximum frequency at which designed circuits operate. At the time of writing this
book, the available technologies are mostly suitable for optimized circuit design in
the bottom half of the millimeter-wave band expanding from 30 to 300 GHz, that
is, up to about 150 GHz. As frequencies increase, optimization becomes difﬁcult.
The decrease in feature size is predominantly determined by digital technologies,
while analog and RF technologies typically lag by several years. Although at the
time of writing digital circuits in 45 nm technology are common and 14 nm
technology is ﬁnding its way in analog circuitry, the decrease in feature size cannot
continue indeﬁnitely. The wavelength of the light used for photolithography at
45 nm is 193 nm [13] and although it is still possible to decrease the wavelength for
small feature sizes, difﬁculties in circuit fabrication (and associated costs) are
becoming determining factors in node scaling. It is clear that the Moore’s law
phenomenon is coming to an end and that efforts need to be made to ﬁnd innovative
ways of improving circuit performance. Furthermore, with such small feature sizes,
making interconnects between devices is not trivial, and advanced fabrication
technologies must take advantage of back-of-the-line (BEOL) processing [22].
BEOL allows multiple different metallization layers to be used, with different
material properties and thicknesses. At least one metal in a typical BEOL process
has to have better conductivity properties than the others (for example, aluminum
instead of copper). Insulator materials also play a huge role in modern electronics,

therefore new BEOL processes have to be modiﬁed to beneﬁt from better isolation,
and the quest for ultra-low dielectric constant (ULK) materials continues [23]. The
ultimate ULK material is air.
In analog millimeter wave applications, such as the LNA discussed in this book,
the smallest feature size is not necessarily used for all components. Passives, for
example, tend to beneﬁt more from small processing changes that allow an increase
in their performance. An example of such technology is silicon-on-insulator
(SOI) CMOS technology [24, 25]. In SOI technology, a circuit is composed of
single-device islands, which are isolated from each other and from the substrate
[26]. Transistors fabricated in this technology have reduced source/drain junction
capacitances, and passives beneﬁt from reduced substrate coupling. Transistors also
suffer less from short-channel effects. Furthermore, SOI allows for better perfor-
mance at low voltage supplies and has lower leakage currents and reduced antenna
issues, when compared to traditional CMOS technologies. Two basic structures of
SOI transistors are shown in Fig. 8.11, the ﬁrst one (a) being the partially isolated
single-gate device, and the second one (b) a fully isolated double-gate device.

Advanced Low-Noise Ampliﬁer Optimization Topics

High-resistance SOI (HR-SOI) technology is seen as an improvement of the
classic SOI technology. In this technology, a substrate with resistivity of more than
1 kX cm is used [27]. The main advantage of the HR-SOI is seen when imple-
menting passives, more speciﬁcally transmission lines. The main improvement is
due to the decreased resistance per unit length. This dependency is illustrated in
Fig. 8.12 at different frequencies [28] for small resistivity values and different
frequencies. In CPW structures, for example, the attenuation can be brought down
to 0.55 dB/mm, depending on the characteristic impedance [29].
A state-of-the art wideband LNA built in 28-nm fully depleted SOI (FDSOI)
technology was recently proposed by Karaca et al. [30]. FDSOI technology, aided
by the custom design of microstrip transmission lines and capacitors, modeled with
EM simulations, allowed for 64 GHz of bandwidth in W-band. The LNA achieved
a noise ﬁgure of 6 dB from 75 to 105 GHz. A T-network was used for input
impedance matching in order to achieve a low noise ﬁgure, while inter-stage and
output matching networks were designed for high gain over a wide band. The
conﬁguration used three common-source stages. Common-source topology was
preferred over cascode, mainly because of the noise performance. The circuit
diagram of this LNA is shown in Fig. 8.13.
Particular effort in this conﬁguration was exercised towards the design and the
sizing of the active device of the ﬁrst stage. A small value for the transistor ﬁnger
width was found to improve the fMAX of the transistor. A graphical approach was
then used to vary the total number of ﬁngers until the bandwidth of the input
matching network had been maximized without compromising the low-noise match
conditions and while also retaining reasonable DC power consumption.

The quality and insertion loss of passives fabricated on low resistivity (normal)
silicon substrates can alternatively be improved by fabricating a low-loss suspended
membrane [31]. The membrane acts as an insulator, and although demonstrated, the
fabrication of such a membrane faces many technical challenges.
MEMS techniques have been discussed in some detail in Chap. 4. One of the
main problems with passive MEMS components is the repeatability of their fab-
rication. Recently, however, fabrication of nanoinductors was proposed, using a
CMOS-compatible technique named glancing angle physical vapor deposition
(GLAD) of thin ﬁlms [32]. Types of structures that can be implemented via GLAD
include nickel posts and helices, which can be used as inductors, suitable for use at
frequencies from 10 to 70 GHz. The most important limitation of GLAD ﬁlm is the
simulation of devices that are incorporated, owing to the extremely high aspect ratio
of the model.
LNAs, speciﬁcally, will beneﬁt from technologies geared to decrease the
receiver noise. Ongoing efforts to optimize the RF performance of BiCMOS
technologies have resulted in HBTs with decreased parasitics. This is achieved by
the complete self-alignment of the emitter, base and the collector as part of the
DOTSEVEN (fMAX = 700 GHz) initiative [33]. As research continues and as fre-
quency increases towards the terahertz operation, there are many other technologies
that could emerge, such as graphene, atimonide-based and plasmonic devices.

Minimizing Passive Parasitic Effects
Suboptimum operation of LNAs can also be overcome by improving the quality of
passives deployed in circuit implementation without seeking more advanced fab-
rication techniques. While quite a number of options for the implementation of
passives exist for millimeter-wave technologies, whether discrete or integrated,
traditional passives are typically implemented using techniques that have been
available for decades. Neither the concept of a spiral inductor nor that of trans-
mission lines is new. Although various techniques can be used to optimize their
implementation (which will be seen later in Chap. 9), moving over to the
millimeter-wave regime opens up an opportunity to investigate some emerging or
future techniques for implementation of passive components. These passives are
implemented with millimeter-wave applications in mind, therefore they are inher-
ently optimized for this regime and could present a much better ﬁt for LNA and
receiver circuits in future.
Furthermore, traditional passives can be optimized for millimeter-wave opera-
tion by making minor modiﬁcations to their implementation. This section will,
therefore, look at several options for minimizing the parasitic effects introduced by
passives.
8.4.1
Passive Components on Chip
This section will look at some emerging passive component implementations on
chip, that is, on silicon substrates.
8.4.1.1
Slow Co-planar Waveguides
Reasons for using transmission lines at millimeter-wave frequencies became
obvious early in this book. The justiﬁcation was expanded on in Chap. 6 where
transmission lines were used to build wideband LNAs. A number of ways to
improve the quality of transmission lines have been investigated recently, one of
them being the approach to implementing slow-wave co-planar waveguides
(S-CPW) [29, 34]. S-CPW have up to now been aimed mostly at the implemen-
tation of millimeter-wave ﬁlters [35], but other millimeter-wave circuits, such as
power ampliﬁers [36] and LNAs [37], have also been implemented as proof of
concept.
Conventional CPW structures suffer from high attenuation at millimeter-wave
frequencies, with attenuation increasing with frequency. For example. attenuation
can get as high as 3 dB/mm at 60 GHz [29, 34]. The attenuation can be decreased
by using HR-SOI as described earlier, which in turn, naturally, improves the quality

factor. This is also evident if the expression of the quality factor of a transmission
line is rewritten in terms of the effective relative substrate permittivity er:

ð8:2Þ
where a and b have been deﬁned in Chap. 4 and v is the phase velocity of the wave,
equal to the speed of light, as deﬁned in Chap. 2. Using HR-SOI allows for higher
er, thus resulting in better transmission-line quality factors.
On the other hand, using a high-resistance substrate is not the only way to
improve the effective er. This can also be achieved by decreasing the phase velocity.
One way to decrease the phase velocity is to separate the storage of electric and
magnetic energy in the waveguide spatially, which is possible with the CPW
structure shown in Fig. 8.14. In this structure, the patterned shield strips between
conductors and the substrate, arranged perpendicularly to the wave propagation,
contain the electric ﬁeld between the CPW and shielding strips. The containment of
the electric ﬁeld is illustrated in Fig. 8.15 by comparing the ﬁeld lines with and
without perpendicular shielding [38]. On the other hand, the magnetic ﬁeld can still
go through the slots in the shielding strips, as illustrated in Fig. 8.16, which is
sufﬁcient for all the magnetic energy to propagate, as it would in a conventional
CPW. The combination of a contained electric ﬁeld and a magnetic ﬁeld that is
contained effectively reduces the phase velocity of the wave, resulting in the term
“slow-wave”. The effective er is increased and the slow-wave factor (SWF) is
deﬁned as the square root of the ratio of the effective relative substrate permittivity
achieved by the slowing of the wave to the effective substrate permittivity of the
wave that the structure would have had without wave slowing, or

S-CPW can be designed for different characteristic impedances, similar to tra-
ditional CPW and microstrip lines. The upper metal layers are stacked with vias to
reduce the losses in the CPW main conductor. In addition, ﬂoating strips are placed
on the lowest and thinnest metal layers to reduce eddy current losses, and eddy
current losses are negligible in well-designed S-CPW up to at least 100 GHz.
The electrical model of the S-CPW line is shown in Fig. 8.17 [39].
The inductance L is created by the magnetic ﬁeld generated by current ﬂowing in
the main conductor and ground and is equal to the inductance that would appear in
the conventional CPW. Capacitance C appears owing to various sources (point

charges, capacitance of the bottom plate, fringing and angle effects and the
capacitance of the upper plate) and is increased when compared to the capacitance
of the traditional CPW. Capacitance Css is the strip-to-strip capacitance. The losses
are represented by resistances Rp, Reddy and Rs, due to conductive loss of silicon
substrate, eddy and shield strip losses, respectively. Finally, the current ﬂowing in
the shield ribbons also introduces an inductive effect, modeled by shunt inductance
Lp. Because of the complexity of their model, S-CPW are typically designed with
the assistance of 3D EM modeling software.
One of the main difﬁculties in the physical implementation S-CPW structures is
the necessity for shielding, which complicates the layout of the structure as opposed
to, for example, the layout of the conventional CPW. A particular problem arises if
a T-junction of the line needs to be implemented. This problem is normally over-
come by reverting to traditional CPW for implementing junctions. In sufﬁciently
short structures, the additional losses can be kept to a minimum.
As discussed in the introductory lines of this section, S-CPW can ﬁnd their use
in circuits such as LNAs. A more recent implementation of an LNA deploying
S-CPW has been achieved by Park and Niknejad [40]. The 100-GHz wideband
LNA was implemented with bandwidth in mind, which is normally limited by
multiple interstage matching networks. Multiple stages, in this case three, are
necessary to provide enough gain while maintaining noise suppression. Thus, the
S-CPW is utilized to achieve compact-size matching networks between the three
stages of the ampliﬁer. S-CPW were used throughout the circuit, except at the
T-shape junctions, where the discontinuity of the S-CPW required a conventional
CPW approach. The top metal of the process (metal 7) was used for the signal and
ground plane. The remaining metals (1 to 6) were used for stacked ﬁlaments,
achieving the effective er of 13.
All three CMOS stages are implemented with a source-degeneration inductor,
whereas the ﬁrst stage is optimized for noise and the second and third stages are
conjugately matched for maximum power gain. The circuit diagram of the LNA is
shown in Fig. 8.18, where different symbols were used to differentiate traditional
CPW from S-CPW. The ampliﬁer achieved a peak power gain of 8.8 dB at
103 GHz with output return loss of 19 dB and bandwidth of 20 GHz, measured
with pads. The minimum noise ﬁgure achieved was 6.9 from a 1.2-V power supply.
Recently, an ultra S-CPW line was proposed [41]. In this CPW transmission line
implementation, signal lines (both signal and ground) are loaded with open stubs

and additional shielding structures are applied, as illustrated in Fig. 8.19. In this
way, a compact structure with low losses is achieved. Open stubs increase the
effective capacitance of the structure, and the larger capacitance of the line is
associated with the decrease of the wavelength of the signals traveling on the
transmission line, as seen earlier. The additional stubs on the ground lines cause
strong coupling to appear between the signal and the ground, increasing the
capacitance even further. In addition, the shielding blocks the electric ﬁeld pene-
trating the substrate.
8.4.1.2
Substrate Integrated Waveguides
A SIW is a waveguide that is implemented inside a substrate material. It has been
used extensively in recent years with PCB substrates to implement transmission
lines, antennas, ﬁlters and other components and the quality factors that can be
achieved are suitable for millimeter-wave applications [42]. Rectangular SIW is a
simple structure, consisting of two parallel metal plates that are joined by vertical
vias on two sides of the waveguide, as illustrated in Fig. 8.20.

Integration of SIW structures with integrated technologies such as CMOS and
BiCMOS, however, has been hindered by the large footprint of these structures.
Furthermore, to implement the rectangular waveguide, the TEM mode of propa-
gation of waves needs to be transformed into the transverse electric (TE) mode of
propagation, and the size of the transition structure is a concern for integrated
implementations.
The footprint of the SIW in integrated technologies, however, can be reduced by
introducing a T-folded SIW structure (FSIW) such as the one illustrated in Fig. 8.21
[42]. Folding retains the effective width of the waveguide but the actual footprint
(width) is decreased. The waveguide is built such that stacks of vias connect
different metal layers. Furthermore, regular transitions between FSIW and CPW
deployed on PCBs are impractical (these will be discussed later with embedded
waveguides), and a structure involving a current loop is suggested. In this structure,
illustrated in Fig. 8.22, the signal from the top waveguide side is brought down
using vias to the metal layer directly below the top metal, then it is taken hori-
zontally over a short microstrip segment, and then directly up again onto a pad (or a
regular signal line). That way, a current loop is created that excites a magnetic ﬁeld
that executes the coupling between two different transmission line propagation
modes.

8.4.1.3
Other On-Chip Millimeter-Wave Passives
The usefulness of spiral inductors at millimeter-wave frequencies, predominantly
due to their more compact sizes when compared to transmission lines, has already
been discussed. Various techniques have been proposed recently to enhance, even
marginally, the behavior of such passives to motivate their use in circuits such as
LNAs.
Ground planes were mentioned as one technique that can be used to shield the
spiral inductor, but nothing was said about how the ground is laid out. Typically, a
simple approach of using a symmetric ground plane is deployed, such as illustrated
in Fig. 8.23a. Meng et al. [43] propose the Q-factor enhancement of the spiral
inductor by introducing an asymmetrical ground plane. As the inductor itself is not
a fully symmetric structure (particularly for small turn variations), such as once
again illustrated in Fig. 8.23a, it was seen that the asymmetric ground plane is a
better candidate for inductor implementation. Therefore, by utilizing EM simula-
tions it was found that the Q-factor of the structure with asymmetric ground, shown
in Fig. 8.23b, is improved by about 0.55 over the symmetric structure. Slightly
higher inductance was also observed.
The concept of coupling of spiral inductors was also already discussed when
discussing nested inductors in Chap. 4. Coupling can also be utilized by placing
two or more regular spiral inductors close together, such as illustrated for two
inductors in Fig. 8.24a [44]. Mutual inductance increases the obtainable value of
inductance, but because of the proximity of the spirals, an additional capacitance
appears, as illustrated in Fig. 8.24b.

8.4.2
Embedded Passive Components
The term “embedded passive components” typically refers to the passive compo-
nent embedded in the packaging of ICs and systems. Antennas will be discussed in
a separate section, allowing this section to focus on embedded inductors and
transmission lines.
8.4.2.1
Embedded Inductors
The single metal layer forming the redistribution layer in eWLB packaging tech-
nology is sufﬁcient for implementation of many components, including inductors.
One of the advantages seen in utilizing the redistribution layer to implement spiral
inductors is the fact that a larger area can be implemented, if compared to the size of
inductors possible on chip. This allows for larger diameters and wider spiral turns.
Inductors or parts of inductors can be placed both over the chip (fan-in area) and
around the chip (fan-out area) [21]. The mold compound has better electrical
properties (e.g. the skin depth) than the silicon substrate of the IC, therefore the
inductors placed in the fan-in area will have similar quality factors as the inductors
on chip, and the inductors placed in the fan-out area (that is, over the mold com-
pound) will have a much higher Q-factor than the other two types.
A typical inductor placed in the fan-out area of eWLB technology is shown in
Fig. 8.25. Note the fact that the redistribution area has only one layer and this does
not allow for the underpass to be fabricated, therefore the inductor can only have
one turn, as opposed to the on-chip spiral inductors. The use of the differential
conﬁguration allows for the mutual coupling to be utilized to increase the induc-
tance of the structure. The terminals of the inductor are placed such that they can
connect to the silicon die. The Q-factor of this structure peaks in the low-GHz
range, but still remains high (over 10) above 20 GHz. The SRF of the inductor is
also much higher when compared to that of the integrated inductor.

Similar models as for integrated spiral inductors can be used for the embedded
inductor. A model of the inductor shown in Fig. 8.25 can therefore be represented
by the single-p model for each loop, with the addition of the mutual inductance
coupling for each of the two loops. This is illustrated in Fig. 8.26. The substrate
parasitics Rsub and Csub in this case refer to the parasitics of the mold compound,
and the oxide capacitance Cox seen in integrated inductors is clearly absent in
embedded implementations.
One problem with embedded inductors is the fact that the eWLB process tol-
erances are greater than the process tolerances associated with integrated processes.
Factors such as the thicknesses of dielectrics and the metal layer can affect the
inductance of the inductor structure. Chip-to-package interconnections can also
have a major inﬂuence on the inductor. All these factors need to be considered
when designing these inductors.

Inductors embedded in an eWLB package are not the only embedded inductors
in use. Inductors embedded on other types of SoC implementations using different
substrates have been in use for several decades, such as the inductor implemented
on the laminate substrate demonstrated in [45].
8.4.2.2
Embedded Rectangular Waveguides
Packaging technologies such as eWLB open up opportunities for integration of
transmission lines. Whereas in ICs, the difﬁculty of realizing 3-D structures only
allows the use of microstrip lines and CPW and rectangular waveguides need
special techniques, as discussed earlier, in eWLB it is easier to access the third
dimension and therefore realize these structures.
To contain the wave, the redistribution layer alone is insufﬁcient; rather, addi-
tional
metal
structures
are
needed
[20].
The
sidewall
is
realized
using
through-encapsulant vias and the top wall of the waveguide requires an additional
metallization layer, while the redistribution layer is used as the bottom wall. The
complete structure then looks as illustrated in Fig. 8.27.
Once again, an important aspect to consider when working with eWLB
waveguides is how to realize the transition (mode transformation) between the
waveguide and the CPW structures that have to be used to communicate to the
chip. In [20], two transitions are proposed, one based on the via and the other based
on the tapered line, as shown in Fig. 8.28. These transitions are similar to the
integrated transitions seen earlier.
Typical insertion loss of the eWLB rectangular waveguide, including transitions
at 77 GHz, is 1.9 dB.

8.4.3
LNA/Antenna Co-design with Integrated Antennas
and Antennas on Package
In the classic receiver design approach, the LNA and the antenna are two blocks of
the transceiver that are treated completely independently and are therefore designed
by different designers (antenna and circuit designers). Furthermore, when con-
necting the LNA to the antenna, matching is performed simultaneously for mini-
mum noise ﬁgure and maximum power transfer, as discussed before. In real LNA
design, it is extremely difﬁcult to perform the simultaneous match and one rather
has to work with a region of acceptable performance, in which case the priority is
generally given to a low noise ﬁgure at the expense of the loss of power transfer.
One way of avoiding LNA input matching is to design the antenna together with
the LNA, in the emerging approach called LNA/antenna co-design [46]. At
millimeter-wave frequencies, the size of the antenna is small enough for the antenna
to be integrated on silicon and placed closely to the LNA circuitry. Also, since the
antenna is integrated, there is no need to bring the signal from the antenna into the
integrated LNA via packaging leads and bonding pads, removing unnecessary los-
ses. The antenna is typically integrated in the thickest metal layer of the process,
similar to the approach taken with the integrated inductors and transmission lines to
minimize further losses. The antenna-on-chip concept is illustrated in Fig. 8.29 [46].
The co-design of the antenna and the LNA is performed in such a way that their
impedances are nearly conjugate, therefore resulting in almost maximum possible
power transfer between the antenna and the LNA. The maximum available power
can be delivered if

where RLNA and XLNA are the resistance and reactance of the LNA respectively and
Ra and Xa are similarly the resistance and reactance of the antenna respectively. The
power available at the input to the LNA is then
PLNA ¼ M  Pa
ð8:6Þ
One drawback of this approach is that the integrated antenna gains are typically
quite low. This is due to radiation losses that that are extremely large owing to
substrate absorption [47]. Typical on-chip antennas have only about 10% efﬁciency,
but this problem can be overcome by fabricating highly directional antennas. As
frequency increases, however, the beneﬁt of being able to remove the metal
interconnects in integrated antennas outweighs the drawback of low integrated
antenna efﬁciency.
Alternatively, antennas can be printed on the substrate in SoP/SiP realizations, or
they can even be placed on the lids of IC packages. In this way, antennas are placed
as closely as possible to the chip, while maintaining acceptable performance.
Embedded antennas can achieve higher efﬁciencies than on-chip antennas because
of the increased distance from the lossy substrate. Furthermore, the best GBP of the
antenna is obtained using materials with low dielectric constants (such as Teﬂon
with er = 2.2 or liquid crystal polymers with er = 3.1). Some package options allow
multiple antennas to be placed in the package, and arrays of up to 32 antennas have
been realized in the past [13]. High-performance antennas have also been imple-
mented on the redistribution layer of the eWLB package [19].
8.4.4
Switches and Tunability
A certain degree of tunability is a desired property of many RF and millimeter-wave
circuits. Despite the approach where LNAs with ever-wider bandwidths are sought,
tunability still has merit in narrowband conﬁgurations. Tunable ﬁlters, for example,
have been reported before [48]. Tunability is typically accomplished using MEMS
components, varactor diodes, switch diodes or ferroelectric components.
In addition to tunability, switching of different signal paths is a common
requirement in millimeter transceivers. In Chap. 7, for example, a bidirectional
PALNA circuit [49] was investigated, where a power ampliﬁer and an LNA were
coupled together. Switches, such as the MEMS cantilever reported by Chaturvedi
et al. [50], are good candidates for adding additional degrees of freedom in the
millimeter-wave design. In this paper, the RF MEMS cantilever switch structure is

position. The measured S21 is less than −17 dB for the entire frequency range, S11 is
−0.64 dB and the isolation is 17.42 dB at 65 GHz. At this stage of the ongoing
research, the actuation voltages are high; nevertheless, this work can be considered
a proof of concept for millimeter-wave frequencies.

Concluding Remarks
In this chapter, several ways of optimizing LNAs have been presented. It was seen
that a typical LNA can be optimized in the layout and packaging stages by con-
sidering and modeling all the inﬂuences that may arise: unwanted coupling and the
speciﬁc layout arrangements, as well as bonding and packaging. New ways of
packaging and packaging technologies that are geared towards removing parasitics
were also discussed. This chapter also reconsidered the fabrication of active and
passive components in semiconductor technologies, looking at advanced techniques
that can be used to minimize transistor parasitics at millimeter-wave frequencies,
and at the same time improve the quality of passives. Passives typically used with
millimeter-wave LNAs are based on implementations that are several decades old,
and some alternatives for the implementation of passives were examined. S-CPW
and embedded passives currently seem to be the most viable options. Optimizing of
the LNA together with the receiving antenna, by means of LNA/antenna co-design,
was also investigated, together with some switching options at the end.
The topic of LNA optimization is carried over to Chap. 9. In this chapter, a
different perspective of LNA optimization will be taken, where it will be shown
how traditional LNAs and their passives can be optimized using EDA and computer
intelligence.

Chapter 9
Low-Noise Ampliﬁer Optimization
via Electronic Design Automation
Abstract This chapter starts with a short introduction on the current state of EDA
tools and their description, an extension on the discussion in Chap. 1. The rest of
the chapter then deals with optimum design of passives, LNAs and receivers. The
design of LNAs, like that of any other circuits, will remain a highly iterative
procedure. However, at the end of this book, in Chap. 10, an updated improved
procedure combining the LNA design approaches taken throughout this chapter,
and based on the ﬁndings of this book, will be proposed. An illustration of some
EDA efforts is given, using snippets of scripts developed in MATLAB.
In the previous chapter, it was seen that in general, the speciﬁcations of all LNAs,
irrespective of complexity and/or conﬁguration, can be improved by replacing
standard passive and active components by state-of-the art components. This often
requires advanced, and if not custom, processing as well as innovative ideas for
reaching high gains and low noise (active components) or a high Q-factor (passive
components). Increased accuracy of circuit modeling and packaging, as well as
using state-of-the art or novel types of packaging, can also aid in optimizing per-
formance. Nevertheless, some of these approaches come at great cost. This chapter
proposes some EDA optimization techniques that can be used as an alternative
approach to LNA optimization presented up to now, or even better, in conjunction
with those techniques. In this approach, inexpensive standard components can
typically be optimized for a speciﬁc application by developing custom EDA
subroutines.
Considering that the design of the inductor and the transmission line is a bot-
tleneck when millimeter-wave design is considered, this chapter accepts the
inductor as well as transmission-line theory and modeling described in Chap. 5 as
necessary for accurate component design, and shows how the models can be used to
automate the passive component design and at the same time optimize their
Q-factor, if applicable, by using various programming or scripting languages. The
chapter covers a range of inductor options and transmission lines. Furthermore,
even with optimized passives for a particular application or a frequency range, the
design of actual LNA ampliﬁcation stages and even matching networks remains

tedious, therefore EDA is taken one step further, towards the design of actual LNA
conﬁgurations and receiver systems. Although the aim of this chapter is to provide
background for synthesis and optimization of LNAs, the techniques presented can
serve as a vehicle for optimization of any microwave or millimeter-wave compo-
nents, such as ﬁlters, mixers or power ampliﬁers [1].
Since EDA already plays a major role in the design of all electronic circuits (and
particularly of millimeter-wave electronic circuits where EM simulations are also
required), this chapter starts with a short introduction on the current state of EDA
tools and their description. This will be an extension on the discussion in Chap. 1.
The rest of the chapter then deals with optimum design of passives, LNAs and
receivers. The design of LNAs, like that of any other circuits, will remain a highly
iterative procedure. However, at the end of this book, in Chap. 10, an updated
improved procedure combining the LNA design approaches taken throughout this
chapter, and based on the ﬁndings of this book, will be proposed.
An illustration of some EDA efforts is given, using snippets of scripts developed
in MATLAB (discussed in Sect. 9.1). The MATLAB version for script develop-
ment was 2016a.
9.1
Current State of Electronic Design Automation
Research and development of millimeter-wave circuits, as in the case of most
electronics and microelectronics circuits, are aided by a large number of EDA tools.
Since a typical millimeter-wave circuit is fabricated in complex fabrication tech-
nologies or specialized processes, as seen in Chap. 4, in order to speed up the
design process, iron out errors in the system during this process, and minimize the
number of fabrication iterations before fully functional circuits are achieved, a large
number of design, simulation and layout tools have found their way into the market.
The role of EDA in various stages of general circuit design was already mentioned
in Chap. 1 and subsequently this section reviews the current state of the EDA tools,
as they pertain to millimeter-wave design.
Modern commercial EDA tools have an extensive integration capability with
other tools and a multitude of functions that automate and accelerate the design
process. EDA packages are typically used to perform EM simulations (planar or
full-wave 3-D), system-level simulations and aid with layout, among other
tasks.
An important distinction exists between transistor-level circuit simulators and
EM ﬁeld solver tools, and these two types of software often have to be used in
conjunction with each other (simulations that combine transistor and EM simula-
tions are often referred to as EM and circuit co-simulations). EM solvers are capable
of predicting crucial system parameters such as losses, parasitics and impedances,
whereas regular circuit simulations are used to predict time domain, frequency
domain, DC and RF behavior.

Low-Noise Ampliﬁer Optimization via Electronic Design Automation

In order for EDA tools to remain effective, the models upon which they are built
need to represent the behavior of their real-life counterparts as accurately as pos-
sible. It is important for designers and researchers to understand the limitations of
the existing models (and when working at frequencies as large as millimeter-wave
frequencies, limitations that high-frequency operation imposes). Component man-
ufacturers and technology providers (foundries) typically engage EDA companies
to provide speciﬁc simulation models in the form of standard libraries and p-cells,
which are typically portable across EDA platforms. The complete package needed
for the design provided by foundries is termed a process design kit (PDK).
Most EDA vendors strive to provide design solutions for a wide range of sim-
ulation types and for a complete system design ﬂow. Simulations techniques range
from linear and nonlinear to system level, mixed signal or EM [2].
A short list of popular EDA software packages relating to millimeter-wave
systems on the market today is provided below:
• Microwave Ofﬁce, NI AWR Corporation (linear and nonlinear EM simulations);
• Advanced Design System (ADS) with Momentum and EMPro, Agilent
Technologies Inc (full linear and nonlinear system design);
• IE3D, Zeland Software Inc. (acquired by Mentor Graphics) (3-D EM
simulations);
• CST Microwave Studio, Computer Simulation Technology AG (3-D EM
simulations);
• Ansoft HFSS, ANSYS Inc. (3-D EM simulations);
• Virtuoso with Analog Design Environment (ADE) and SpectreRF, Cadence
Design Systems, Inc. (RF IC design with non-linear simulations);
• Sonnet, Sonnet Software (IC EM modeling and simulation up to THz
frequencies);
• SmartSpiceRF, Silvaco (physical-level device simulation and spice-based design
and layout);
• MATLAB, Mathworks Inc. (Mathematical component and system modeling);
and
• Various programming and scripting languages.
A typical detailed RF design ﬂow (which is often difﬁcult to separate from the
mixed-mode design ﬂow) is illustrated in Fig. 9.1 [3]. This ﬁgure illustrates all
steps, from conceptual design all the way to the IC prototyping blueprints (layouts).
However, depending on the detail of the design, not all the steps are always
undertaken. Only when the layout is complete, can the physical design can be
veriﬁed to see if it meets the design criteria.
The missing link when designing using commercial EDA is component and
system optimization (although these steps are illustrated in the ﬁgure, they are often
done by hand). In addition, the typical design approach is mostly iterative, and there
is a distinct lack of streamlining. For example, if a mistake is picked up late in the
design ﬂow, the whole design process needs to be repeated, which can become
tedious, especially if there are many hand-design stages. The typical approach also

requires extensive repetitive simulation efforts. As a result, EDA is typically used
for analysis of hand-drawn circuits and components, followed by the physical
implementation of those circuits, as opposed to a more effective circuit and com-
ponent synthesis (which can naturally be followed by the physical implementation).
The rest of this chapter aims to bridge the gaps in the typical LNA design ﬂow
by suggesting how custom EDA tools can be used in conjunction with commercial
EDA tools (even if the custom tools are just scripts for use with tools like
MATLAB) for circuit and component synthesis and optimization.
9.2
Optimum Design of Passive Components
Looking back towards the introductory chapter, it is hypothesized that optimum
LNAs can be designed by optimizing their parts (for example, passives such as
inductors), or optimizing the complete LNA system (or even a receiver). An
inductor is an extremely good example of a passive device where the analysis of the
given circuit is inhibiting circuit design, rather than aiding the process.
Consequently, in this section, the optimum design of passive components is
presented. The abovementioned inductors and related components (e.g. RFCs or
transformers), whether integrated or discrete, are by far the most difﬁcult passives to
design, not only at millimeter-wave frequencies, but even for much lower RF
bands. Therefore, a substantial portion of this section will be dedicated to inductor
design and optimization with the aid of EDA. The design of transmission lines
might not necessarily require optimization, but it could be tedious, and an EDA
approach to transmission line design is also suggested in this section.
9.2.1
Performance Optimization by Synthesizing Optimum
Spiral Inductors and Transformers
Inductors have traditionally been difﬁcult to integrate because of their inherently
low Q-factors and their modeling complexity, even at frequencies as low as RF.
Even
though

conﬁgurations
are
available
for
millimeter-wave researchers to explore, support for integrated inductors in EDA
tools and process design kits has been very limited in the past [1, 4].
Vendors typically provide libraries of several qualiﬁed integrated inductors for
each RF-capable process, p-cells for inductors, or both. However, each of these
inductors operates at its peak Q-factor only in a small frequency range, making use
of inductors from libraries that are impractical for many applications. P-cells are
somewhat easier to handle, but the required inductance is typically reached by
repetitive geometry guessing. What is thus missing, is the application and
technology-aware optimization. This approach can be used for integrated inductor
9.1

design, where an inductor synthesis algorithm based on spiral inductor design
equations and models presented in Chap. 4 is used. If the algorithm is designed
properly, it allows millimeter-wave designers to optimize integrated inductors,
given the inductor center frequency dictated by the device application and the
geometry constraints. This not only lays down a foundation for system-level circuit
performance optimization, but because inductors are often the largest parts of an RF
system, it also allows for optimal usage of the chip ﬂoorplan.
Spiral Inductors
Inductance of a spiral inductor is determined by several geometry parameters. This
means that if one is to vary only one parameter, e.g. the number of turns, the other
parameters need to meet some conditions. Thus the process of parameter sweep is
not intuitive. This is best illustrated by varying some design parameters (inner and
outer parameter, spiral width and number of turns), as shown in Table 9.1. In this
table, a data-ﬁtted monomial expression for square inductors is used to calculate
inductance, and then parameters are varied to illustrate the behavior of the values of
inductance. The inductors obtained are depicted in Fig. 9.2.
It can be observed that number of turns n can be varied to result in substantial
steps in inductance values, but given that n is discrete, the other parameters all need
to be varied in conjunction with n. The complexity of the situation increases if the
Q-factor is investigated in terms of the same parameters, because the inductance
and the Q-factor now need to be tweaked simultaneously. The procedure of
reaching the required inductance value is, therefore, a quite iterative cut-and-try
approach such as illustrated in Fig. 9.3.
An alternative approach suggested here is to introduce a search-algorithm-based
routine that can ﬁnd an inductor of the speciﬁed value, with the highest possible
Q-factor, occupying a limited area, and using predetermined technology layers [1,
4]. This refers to the synthesis of an inductor structure. Any of the spiral inductor
models described in Chap. 4 can be used as a starting point, depending on the
required accuracy. The nine-component single-p model of a single-layer spiral

inductor, shown in Fig. 4.30, although not adequate for millimeter-wave frequen-
cies, is sufﬁcient for illustration purposes. The exact inductor shape (square,
octagonal, circular) is not important, as long as a lookup table with correct coef-
ﬁcients for inductance calculations is used in the computations. Synthesis alone is
not always sufﬁcient, however, and the routine must be expanded to make provision
for the analysis of an inductor geometry in terms of inductance and the Q-factor.

In the nine-component model, it is necessary to compute LS, resistances RS and
Rsub, and capacitances, CS, Cox and Csub. If the data-ﬁtted monomial expression is
used for inductance computation (similar results can be obtained with different
spiral inductance equations but with various degrees of accuracy), and the Q-factor
and resonant frequency computations are included, the equations tabulated in
Table 9.2 can be used in the subroutine.
As the second step, design equations need to be analyzed to deduce input
parameters to the proposed routine. Geometry parameters predominantly inﬂuence
the computed inductance value, and clearly need to be considered as input. If one
knows the outer diameter, dout, the inner diameter, din, turn width, w, and number of
turns, n, this is sufﬁcient for inductor analysis. For inductor synthesis, however, it is
only necessary to specify the constraints on the inductor geometry to conﬁne the
search space. Typically, these are set so that inductor design good practices are
adhered to and none of the DRCs of the speciﬁc process is broken. Geometry is
constrained by the minimum value of the inner diameter, din(min), the maximum
value of the outer diameter, dout(max), the minimum value for turn spacing, smin, and
the minimum turn width, wmin. The minimum turn spacing is not increased, because
it allows for maximum coupling between the turns of the spiral.
Further, for synthesis, the tolerance (in percentage) for the acceptable inductance
values needs to be speciﬁed as well. This is the metric that determines how closely
the actual required inductance value can deviate from the found inductance value
(typically set to 5 or 10%). Grid resolution (in micrometer) is also required, which
determines the steps in the search (typ. 1 lm in submicron processes).

Table 9.3 summarizes the geometry input parameters, together with some typical
values.
The Q-factor of an inductor structure is predominantly determined by the
technology in which the inductor is fabricated. This is because the inductor para-
sitics are process-dependent. Parasitics also introduce a shift in the apparent
inductance value at a speciﬁc frequency. The frequency of operation also inﬂuences
the computation of parasitics and the Q-factor. Knowing the process in which the
inductor is to be fabricated as well as the intended application of the system allows
for technology and frequency-aware inductor optimization.

The process parameters are usually obtained or calculated from parameters
obtained in the datasheets supplied by the process foundry. Table 9.4 summarizes
the technology input parameters and their typical values for a sub-micron process.
The main (synthesis) part of the proposed inductor design routine is a search
algorithm that looks into a range of possible geometries and identiﬁes a geometry
that will result in the required inductance within a certain tolerance. Technology
awareness allows an inductor with the highest Q-factor to be picked from several
inductors that are typically found in the search. The accuracy of the algorithm
depends on the tolerance for the required inductance values and on the search grid
resolution, where higher tolerance of the inductance value will result in less
accurate inductance values. Higher tolerance also adds ﬂexibility for ﬁnding
inductors with higher Q-factors. The chance of ﬁnding a solution also depends on
the grid resolution, where with an increase in the grid resolution, there is a greater
probability that the high-Q inductor will be found.
Mathematically, the synthesis of optimum inductors can be represented as
follows:

The time of execution and memory requirements of the search algorithm for
greater grid resolutions for large inductor ﬂoorplans would typically increase
enough for the delay to be noticed. The tradeoff among the search grid, tolerance in
the designed inductor value, Q-factor and time of execution on a computer with an
i7 processor is illustrated in Table 9.5 for a typical 2 nH inductor at 2.4 GHz in a
typical submicron BiCMOS process. In cases where the time of execution of the
algorithm becomes unacceptable, the regular search algorithm could be replaced by
a genetic algorithm [5] (genetic algorithms MATLAB toolbox is available), but for
practical search grid resolutions and tolerances, this is not necessary.
If the synthesis of the inductor is complemented with the inductor analysis, then
the complete algorithm may look like that illustrated in Fig. 9.4. The synthesis part
is typically accomplished by having various nested search loops (not shown): in the
innermost loop, n is varied. In the middle loop, w is varied and in the outermost
loop, din is varied, all within a speciﬁed search space. The analysis part is the
straight-forward inductor and Q-factor value calculation, based on the model.
A snippet of the MATLAB code illustrating the search algorithm is shown in
Fig. 9.5.
Furthermore, calculation of parasitics, as well as the inductance and Q-factors, is
shown in Figs. 9.6 and 9.7 respectively.
The outputs of the inductor design routine could be the textual outputs con-
taining the inductance values, values of all parasitics, Q-factor, and resonance
frequency, as well as the dimensions of the inductor, if synthesis was performed.
However, simple programming techniques may be used to automatically interpret
numerical results to export the SPICE netlist and/or the layout of the inductor (for
example, in GDSII1 format).
Although different SPICE formats are used in different commercial EDA
packages described in Sect. 9.1, tools typically support import and conversion
capabilities. Therefore, designed inductors can be used in designs and for simula-
tion purposes, without the need to redraw the schematics of inductor models and
manually update component values, thus seamlessly integrating the custom EDA
efforts with commercial packages and allowing for the streamlined design ﬂow.
A snippet of the MATLAB code illustrating netlist export into T-spice netlist format
is illustrated in Fig. 9.8.

Similar reasoning can be used for the export of layouts, where layouts of
exported inductors can be streamed in and placed in layout in commercial simu-
lators. In fact, the inductors in Fig. 9.2 were created via custom EDA design
programs, exported in GDSII format, and streamed into a commercial EDA layout
editor.

In MEMS inductor implementations, the fabrication process is modiﬁed in some
way to decrease the inﬂuence of the process parasitics and increase Q-factors. For

applied, but the equations in Table 9.2 must be modiﬁed for lower inﬂuence of
applicable parasitics. For example, in the case where the oxide below the spiral is
removed, the formulas for Cox and Cs will change to resemble lower capacitance
because of the relative permittivity changes (because silicon-dioxide is replaced by
air). The capacitance between the spiral and the underpass is likely to change as
well. If, on the other hand, substrate is removed below the spiral, this would result
in the removal of Rsub and Csub components in the inductor model, in which case
the calculation of the Q-factor would also change.

Integrated Transformers
The inductor design program can be expanded to include spiral transformer design,
but the amount of effort will differ depending on the transformer conﬁguration. In
the case of the one-layer transformer conﬁguration (Fig. 4.41a), the capacitance for
each spiral will remain unchanged from the value seen for the spiral inductor, but
the inductance of each spiral will change. Both spirals will, however, have the same
inductance and Q-factor, as is expected from a 1:1 transformer.
In the case of a two-layer conﬁguration (Fig. 4.41b), two metals are needed for
the spiral and a further two for underpasses. The top and bottom spirals will have
different capacitances, although the inductances will be the same. The capacitance
of the bottom spiral will be between the spiral itself and the substrate, and that of
the top spiral will be between the top spiral and bottom spiral. Typically, the
resistances of the spirals will also be different if the metal layers have different

metal). With an increase in frequency, the apparent value of inductance will differ
signiﬁcantly as well, which would complicate the implementation of the true 1:1
transformer using this conﬁguration.
9.2.2
Ofﬂine Optimization of RF Inductors by Introducing
Optimal Performance Trade-Offs
The approach for spiral inductor design followed in Sect. 9.2.1 resulted in the
so-called online optimization [6]. This in essence means that the inductors are
optimized during the design phase, that is, each inductor is designed optimal only
for one speciﬁc application (e.g. the source degeneration inductor in cascode LNA).
EM simulation of such an inductor is typically performed after the inductor has
been designed to verify the optimum performance. If multiple inductors are
designed, the spiral inductor synthesis (the search for an optimum inductor) and the
subsequent EM simulations need to be executed a large number of times.
An alternative to online optimization is ofﬂine optimization. In this approach, the
inductors are optimized not for a particular application, but rather for a particular
technology, and therefore the inductor, or rather a family of inductors, is designed
beforehand. This is possible if a set of trade-offs for the best performance of an
inductor is introduced, which includes the required inductance (or range of
inductances), acceptable Q-factor at one frequency (or a range of frequencies) and
the inductor real estate (area). The latter is typically speciﬁed in terms of design
variables, such as minimum inner diameter, minimum and maximum spiral width
and maximum number of turns, as before. Inductors are subsequently generated by

formulating a multi-objective optimization problem, similar to the approach seen
for LNAs in Chap. 5 (Fig. 5.15), where each trade-off mentioned above is an
objective. The range of all possible solutions to the optimization problem is called

Low-Noise Ampliﬁer Optimization via Electronic Design Automation

A problem is considered a single-objective problem if n = 1 and a multi-objective
problem if n > 1 [7]. The multi-objective optimization can be performed using an
evolutionary algorithm, such as NGSA-II described in [8]. This algorithm is based
on the evolution of a population of solutions guided by the concept of Pareto
dominance, as illustrated in Fig. 9.9 for two objectives, f1(x), and f2(x). For three
objective functions (e.g. inductance, Q-factor and inductor area A), the resulting
plot would be three-dimensional (vector function is F(x) = {L, Q, A}). Introducing
another objective function (e.g. frequency range) would add a fourth dimension,
and so on. Alternatively, if the objective cannot be represented as a function (e.g.
frequency is ﬁxed), then the objective is a constraint.
Since the inductor family is designed beforehand, EM simulations can be run on
every inductor in the population and rather than using an inductor model for
optimization, the inductor equivalent impedance as a function of frequency can be
computed from S-parameters. Then the inductance is computed in terms of impe-
dance and frequency using Eq. (4.63) and the Q-factor is evaluated with the aid of
Eq. (4.1). For EM simulation to happen, the layout of the inductor has to be
exported automatically into a GDSII ﬁle. The complete inductor design ﬂow, also
showing where objectives, constraints and design variables as well as the solution
(Pareto front of inductors) ﬁt in, is suggested in Fig. 9.10.
9.2.3
Optimum Design of Bond Wires
The same methodology that was used in Sect. 9.2.1 for spiral inductors can be used
to develop a design routine for the design of bond wires, which present a good
alternative to spiral inductors when working with integrated circuits.
It is assumed that the bond wire is placed well above any conducting planes to
avoid generation of any parasitic capacitances. Thus the bond wire inductor can
typically be modeled by the inductor with a resistor in series, as shown in Fig. 4.23a.
If two bond wires are used, the same model can be used, but the total inductance can

be calculated by placing two separate inductors in parallel and adding to the mutual
inductance, resulting in the total value Ltotal = M + L1||L2 (or M + L/2, where
L = L1 = L2) where the symbols are shown in Fig. 4.23b. The total resistance is
Rtotal = R1||R2. Using this simpliﬁcation over and over again, the same model can be
used for any number of bond wires in parallel.
A program that analyzes and synthesizes bond wire inductors made up of one or
two bond wires, where in the latter case the shapes of the two wires are identical,
requires the use of equations from Table 9.6. The required inputs are the length of
the wire, l, the radius of the wire, a, and the pitch between wires for the two-wire
inductor, s. Once more, analysis and synthesis of the component can be performed.
For synthesis, the radius of the wire is ﬁxed (set by bonding materials and
equipment), and in the case of double bond wire, the spacing between bond wires can
be ﬁxed to the minimum allowed value. The minimum spacing allows for maximum
mutual coupling, similar to what was seen previously with the coupling of the turns of

 10−6 H/m), and the conductivity or resistivity of the wire metal, r or q.
(typ. q = 2.82  10−8 Xm), are also required. Finally, the frequency of operation is
needed for computation of the skin depth and the Q-factor.
In this routine, there is no need to perform a search for the best inductor for
inductor synthesis. Wire sizes required for one-wire and two-wire options can both
be simply computed, although the solution for l in Eqs. (4.39) and (4.40) in both
cases requires solving the equation where the unknown appears both inside and
outside the natural logarithm. The simplest is to use the MATLAB solve function in
the command line to solve for l. For a single bond wire, the command is:
> > solve(‘L = M0*ell/(2*pi)*(log(2*ell/a) - 0.75)*1e6’,
ell)
where M0 is the permeability and log is the natural logarithm. The solution is:
ell = 0.5*exp(lambertw(0.594e-5/M0/a*L) + 0.75)*a;
where w = lambertw(x) function is the solution to w*exp(w) = x.
For the double bond wire, one needs to solve L = Lsingle/2 + M equation for l in
a similar manner using MATLAB, to obtain
ell2 = 0.5*exp(lambertw(0.267e-5/M0/s*(3.142*L + 50.

In this case, note that MATLAB was chosen as a language used for illustration
purposes in this chapter and it comes in very handy for solving complicated
equations. If MATLAB or another powerful language with mathematics libraries is
not available to the reader, the equations could be solved using numerical methods
[9].
The analysis option of the bond wire routine is a straightforward calculation,
given the input parameters. The complete bond wire inductor design algorithm is
illustrated in Fig. 9.11, and the snippet of the MATLAB code is shown Fig. 9.12.

Streamlined Design of Transmission-Line Passives
As was seen in Chap. 4, physical dimensions and terminations of a particular
transmission line allow for this element to be turned into a passive with a speciﬁc
behavior (inductive, capacitive, or the termination-speciﬁc behavior of the
quarter-wave transformer). In this section, it will be illustrated how a custom EDA
for design of microstrip quarter-wave transformers can be developed, if the input
and output impedances which the quarter-wave transformer needs to connect are
given. The EDA routine would work out the dimensions of the microstrip line,
resulting from the required characteristic impedance at a given frequency. The
equations for the microstrip line, summarized in Table 9.7, are used for
computations.
Before attempting to design the procedure, it can be noted that the microstrip line
width and the substrate height always appear as a ratio of width to substrate height,
r = w/l. Thus, the quarter-wave microstrip line will be fully described if this ratio is

calculated. Since the ratio is deﬁned by a piecewise function (for w/h < 1 and
w/h > 1), the best approach is solving the characteristic impedance equation iter-
atively. To conﬁrm that there is only one solution to this equation, one can ﬁrst plot
the characteristic impedance equation, as shown in Fig. 9.13. From this plot it is
evident that the impedance as a function of r has no maxima or minima and there is
indeed only one solution. The ﬂow chart of the suggested iterative quarter-wave
line design procedure is shown in Fig. 9.14. The procedure is based on looking for
the value of r between the speciﬁed rmin and rmax. With every iteration attempt,
either rmin or rmax is updated to a new value of r that is the average of old rmin and
rmax, where rmax is updated if the characteristic impedance of the new value is less
than the wanted characteristic impedance, and rmin is updated otherwise. Iterations
continue until the calculated value of the characteristic impedance is within 1% of
the wanted characteristic impedance of the microstrip line. A snippet of the
MATLAB code of this procedure is shown in Fig. 9.15.

calculations becomes too complex to be done by hand or graphically (using Smith
charts) [10]. Matching is typically done with commercial EDA tools, with some of
the tools coming from freeware or shareware licenses. For MATLAB users,
Orfanidis [11] developed an “Electromagnetic Waves & Antennas” MATLAB
toolbox2 containing routines for accomplishing various RF tasks, including the
functions for the design of quarter-wave transformers and L-, P- and T-networks.
Some useful functions are included in Table 9.8. Despite the presence of com-
mercial tools, impedance matching can fairly easily be streamlined using custom
EDA.
LNAs can use both wideband and narrowband matching and the choice of an
output network depends on the speciﬁc application. Therefore, for completeness,
the custom EDA subroutine could incorporate various L-, T- and P-networks, as
well as microstrip matching, and should be able to do both real and complex
matching.

Various matching equations that can be used in this subroutine are tabulated in
Table 9.9. Some of the equations are adapted from Chap. 2 and others have been
sourced from [10]. For all matching equations, the source impedance of the
matching network RS and the load impedance RL need to be known. For the sug-
gested routine, the source and load matching impedances can be complex, a feature
that could be beneﬁcial, for example, for interstage LNA matching. The center

frequency of the matching network (f0) and the bandwidth of the matching network
(BW) are also required, but the latter is only required for narrowband matching
networks (T- and P-networks). Outputs could be set to values of either the lumped
components or the characteristic impedances and dimensions of microstrip lines.
If the subroutine is developed in such a way as to calculate the matching compo-
nents for all possible matching network variations using previously identiﬁed equa-
tions,includingthelumpedcomponent matchingandmatchingusingthequarter-wave
transformer, then this approach allows the user to select the best variation based on the
speciﬁc implementation, the feasibility of the implementation of passives (inductors or
the microstrip line) as well as based on whether there is a necessity to eliminate
separate coupling (blocking) capacitors. The routine can also be extended to check
automatically if component solutions are in a speciﬁed range of values.
A snippet of the MATLAB code of the simpliﬁed impedance matching proce-
dure is given in Fig. 9.16. There is no separate procedure for the design of the
quarter-wave transformer because the same procedure developed previously in this
chapter can be used (in this case, procedure qwt is invoked).

Low-Noise Ampliﬁer Electronic Design Automation
Techniques
In this section, the focus of design automation and optimization moves from passive
components to actual LNA topologies. Five approaches will be presented. In the
ﬁrst approach, S-parameters and the noise ﬁgure are analyzed over a search space to
ﬁnd an optimally sized LNA. The second and the third approach explore some more
evolutionary-algorithm techniques. In the fourth, much simpler approach that can
be performed in-house, small-signal modeling is used in MATLAB to compute the
optimum component values based on LNA modeling performed in Chaps. 4 and 5,
where the graphing capability is suggested as a vehicle to optimize the LNA further.
In the ﬁfth approach, the concept of transistor inversion constant is introduced as a
route towards obtaining MOSFET LNAs that are optimized irrespective of the
degree of transistor inversion (beneﬁcial for low power design). It should be noted
that there are overlaps between these techniques; that is, ideas carried through in
each example can be combined, depending on the necessity of the particular
problem.
At the end of this section, a note is made on how techniques presented in
Sects. 9.2 and 9.3 for passives and matching networks respectively can be brought
together with the proposed approach of this section to achieve complete LNA
integration.
9.4.1
Optimizing Low-Noise Ampliﬁers by Optimizing S-
Parameters with and Without the Backtracking Search
A parallel between the optimization of an LNA and a spiral inductor was already
drawn earlier in this chapter, where it was said that that many design variables need
to be optimized in conjunction in order to yield an optimum design solution.
Therefore, the EDA solution to an LNA design task is expected to be at least as
complex as the design of spiral inductors. In fact, a very similar approach can be
taken towards developing an optimal LNA solution, where design variables, con-
straints and the optimization objective are speciﬁed, and the design problem turns
into an optimization problem once more. The optimization can then be performed
either by executing the search within the deﬁned search space, or by deploying
computational intelligence, such as genetic algorithms, once more on the same
search space.
Despite the fact that a genetic algorithm can execute timeously, the LNA opti-
mization problem regularly has to be simpliﬁed. Boughariou et al. [12] propose an
optimization procedure based on the analysis of S-parameters, or more speciﬁcally,
the magnitude of the forward gain parameter, |S21|, whereas input and output
matching S-parameters (S11 and S22 respectively), as well as the noise ﬁgure (NF)
serve as constraints.

Low-Noise Ampliﬁer Optimization via Electronic Design Automation

This procedure is practical for any LNA topologies for which the input S-
parameters can be computed or simulated, for example the single-band cascode
topology in Fig. 9.17 (with biasing shown). Typically, the S-parameters are com-
puted from Z-parameters using well-known impedance transformations (for
example, see [10]), since for most LNA topologies, Z-parameters can be obtained
from small-signal parameters, as seen in Chaps. 5 and 6. Sizing of the transistor and
biasing inﬂuence the gain and the noise ﬁgure, and thus need to be included in the
optimization problem together with the value of all passive components. As this is
the frequency-dependent problem once more, center frequency needs to also be
speciﬁed. The passive component and transistor minimum dimensions are typically
limited by process design rules, and their maximum dimensions are limited by the
total allowed real estate (and the practical experience of designers).
The optimization algorithm then needs to complete the following objective:

9.4.2
Simulation-Based Evolutionary LNA Design
Optimization
A larger number of constraints can be included in LNA optimization if simulations
drive the optimization process. In [14], an LNA is optimized using the
simulation-based evolutionary approach, where S11, S12, S21, S22, the stability
factor, the noise ﬁgure and the IIP3 are all optimized simultaneously. Upon loading
of the necessary parameters (the parameters that can be optimized, such as device
conﬁguration and the biasing condition), the optimization tools solve a set of
non-linear differential equations to compute the required design components (e.g.
capacitors and inductors) and a simulation is performed. The genetic algorithm
based on the Levenberg-Marquardt method is only activated if the speciﬁcations
cannot be met initially. The algorithm executes repeatedly until the speciﬁcations
are met.
The algorithm was demonstrated by synthesizing and optimizing an LNA circuit
shown in Fig. 9.20. Each element in the ﬁgure is optimized between speciﬁed
limits. Figure 9.21 shows the behavior of parameters S11, S21 and the noise ﬁgure
around 2 GHz for both unoptimized and optimized designs. Although the gain
parameter (S21) is decreased slightly, it is still within speciﬁcations, and the other
parameters are all improved upon. These ﬁgures, therefore, illustrate the advantage
of the optimization process.
Although the capability of this approach was demonstrated in the RF regime,
this method can be extended to millimeter-wave applications with ease.

9.4.3
Ofﬂine Optimization of LNAs
Ofﬂine optimization of inductors using Pareto-optimal fronts was demonstrated
earlier in this chapter. The same concept of ofﬂine optimization can be extended to
the design of LNAs [7]. Parameters such as gain and noise ﬁgure can once again be
considered for optimization, but the number of LNA parameters that can be opti-
mized is not limited and could include the power consumption, IIP3, input and
output matching (S11 and S22 respectively), as well as the stability factor and area
occupation. The complexity of the problem increases with the number of param-
eters, thus the optimization is typically performed for a combination of a maximum
of three performance parameters. Naturally, the LNA is designed using the
inductors previously ofﬂine-optimized using the same technique.

9.4.4
In-House Techniques for Streamlining
and Optimization of Low-Noise Ampliﬁer Designs
A more practical technique than the ones described up to now may be to compute
the small signal parameters and work out important describing equations (gain,
noise ﬁgure, linearity) in terms of variables that can be varied for popular LNA
conﬁgurations, such as the narrowband cascode with inductor degeneration
described in Chap. 5, repeated in Fig. 9.22 for convenience. The procedure can
thereafter easily be expanded to wideband LNAs, as described in Chap. 6.
In this particular cascode conﬁguration (assuming CMOS technology), source
inductance and other LNA components can be computed repeatedly for differing
biases and different sizing of transistor M1. Different values of bias current ID and
the W/L ratio result in different values of transconductance parameter gm1, and the
transistor area (W times L) results in differing values of Cgs1. The two parameters in
turn inﬂuence the value of transitional frequency fT and subsequently the value of
the required inductors Ls and Lg, as well as the gain parameter Gm. Instead of
looking for the optimum solution in many iterations and looking for a way to
optimize the program execution (e.g. via genetic algorithm), the graphing capability
of EDA programs like MATLAB can be used to produce plots of various LNA
parameters, such as stage transconductance, noise ﬁgure, linearity, or even values of
required passive components, allowing the designer to choose an acceptable region
for LNA operation and subsequently afﬁx the required design parameters. Note,
however, that the LNA will be, by the design of the procedure, optimized in terms
of the noise ﬁgure for the particular bias and transistor size. This approach can be
used in-house and on-the-ﬂy since it does not require advanced programming skills
and the only challenge is to identify correct describing equations.
The inputs to the procedure can be speciﬁed in terms of operating frequency (or
upper and lower frequencies, for wideband ampliﬁers), in addition to the ranges of
acceptable bias voltage (or to make matters simpler, bias current) and transistor
size. Technology-deﬁned parameters are also paramount. These include the

transistor mobility, oxide capacitance (and/or constant k′) and the value of
high-frequency gate-resistance parameter rg. For a very simple scenario, where the
values of noise ﬁgure NF, inductors Lg and Ls as well as the value of stage
transconductance Gm are required to be computed, and where it can be assumed that
the common-source transistor M1 operates without velocity saturation (i.e. the
channel length is sufﬁciently long), equations listed in Table 9.10 can be used in
LNA computations. A snippet of the MATLAB code illustrating the concept of the
graphical design procedure is shown in Fig. 9.23. In this procedure, drain current ID
can be varied between minimum and maximum values IDmin and IDmax. The pro-
cedure can be expanded to vary the transistor width W similarly (the smallest value
of L is typically used to maximize gain and minimize Cgs1).
Figures 9.24 and 9.25 show fT, NF, Gm, Ls and Lg graphs obtained for ID values
in the range of 200 µA to 2 mA, with Cox = 3.45 fF/µm2, k′ = 300 µA/V2, rg =
1.5 Ω, L = 0.25 µm and W = 50 µm for a design matched to 50 Ω and operating
at 30 GHz. From these graphs, it can be seen that the design is practical for ID
values greater than 1 mA (lower ID values are probably prohibited by low resulting
fT), and that the noise ﬁgure is relatively low in this region. The ampliﬁer has a fair
amount of gain and the values of inductors are practical for integrated implemen-
tations. In this example, there is no insight into the practicality of the bias point of
M1, but the MATLAB script can easily be extended to include this.

CMOS Low-Noise Ampliﬁer Optimization Based
on Regions of Operation
When working with MOSFET transistors, it is typically assumed that a well-deﬁned
channel exists underneath the gate. If this is the case, the transistor is said to be in
strong inversion [15], and equations from Sect. 3.3.1 of this book are applicable
and can be used in small-signal ampliﬁer design. However, if the gate-source
voltage of the transistor is sufﬁciently high for the depletion region to form but the
voltage is less than the threshold voltage Vt, the transistor is said to be in weak
inversion. In weak inversion, the n-channel MOS transistor operates as an npn

Low-Noise Ampliﬁer Optimization via Electronic Design Automation

The LNA optimization technique accomplished in MATLAB in the previous
section also assumed that the optimum performance of the LNA is reached in strong
inversion. However, in certain applications, the optimum performance of the LNA
can be sought in weak or moderate inversion as well. This is, for example, the case
in ultra-low power (ULP) LNAs, where it can be shown that the lower power
operation is indeed in weak or moderate inversion [16]. This is because of the fact
that subthreshold biasing voltage (that is, the biasing voltage that is lower than the
threshold voltage) allows the use of lower voltage supplies. Lower power operation,
however, is reached at the expense of tight bandwidth, degraded noise performance

as well as linearity. A good compromise can nevertheless be found by investigating
the exact level of inversion and using this ﬁgure in optimization.
To describe the inversion quantitatively and thus allow small signal parameter
computations, an inversion constant (IC) parameter can be introduced. The inver-
sion constant is

of which all parameters were described already in Chap. 3 and in this section. The
transistor is in strong inversion if IC > 10 and in weak inversion if IC < 0.1.
The noise ﬁgure for a typical CMOS transistor cascode LNA (such as the one
depicted in Fig. 9.22) can now be computed in terms of the inversion constant IC.
This is shown in Fig. 9.27 [16]. It can be seen that the noise ﬁgure curve starts
ﬂattening off for IC > 1, that is, in moderate inversion. Similarly, the magnitude of
the forward gain |S21| can also be plotted, as shown in Fig. 9.28. Although the gain
is suboptimal, in this particular case, it can be traded off for low power operation.
Finally, the linearity can be investigated, as in Fig. 9.29. The maximum linearity is
also reached in moderate inversion. Therefore, moderate inversion is probably the
region of operation where the optimum operation in terms of noise ﬁgure, forward
gain, linearity and power can be sought. The region of moderate inversion is
naturally only applicable to the common-source transistor of the cascode, as the
common-gate transistor has much less or no inﬂuence on the power, noise and gain.
Following the above description, a ﬂow diagram for the LNA optimization in
terms of power consumption, as well as traditional optimization constraints, can be
devised. The ﬂow diagram is illustrated in Fig. 9.30. The code for this optimization
will not be developed here.
9.4.6
Complete Low-Noise Ampliﬁer Integration
Complete low-noise integration can be achieved by combining several optimization
and streamlining techniques developed throughout this chapter. A complete LNA
solution is achieved when the LNA is designed using one of the techniques pre-
sented in Sects. 9.4.1 through 9.4.5, with the passive components designed using
techniques presented in Sect. 9.2, and required interstage and output matching
networks designed using techniques described in Sect. 9.3. Finally, the passives for
the matching networks can once again be designed using techniques described in
Sect. 9.2.
If all the above procedures are incorporated in a single user-friendly design
program, a fully streamlined program for rapid design of LNAs will be developed.
The approach of accomplishing this will not be detailed here, but the authors have
previously demonstrated a similar approach for power ampliﬁers in [1].
The custom-design ﬂow for LNA can further be expanded to encompass the full
receiver design, which will be described in the next section.

Receiver Design Using Computational Intelligence
Despite the process of automating the process of streamlining and optimization of
passive components and LNAs, suboptimal design of the complete receiver chain
could invalidate these efforts [17]. Therefore, care needs to be taken to optimize the
receivers based on speciﬁcations of the system in question. The receiver speciﬁ-
cations are most likely going to overlap with those of the LNA.

Receiver Design Using Computational Intelligence
325

Two speciﬁc concerns may be looked at when considering receiver optimization:
1. The choice of the receiver topology; and
2. The optimum distribution of the receiver parameters, viz. gain, noise ﬁgure and
nonlinearity ﬁgure(s).
Each of these concerns will be discussed brieﬂy.
9.5.1
Choosing Receiver Topology
Typically, super-heterodyne, zero-IF, low-IF and double-conversion topologies are
used in modern receivers. Some of these were already discussed in Chap. 1.
The choice of receiver topology is typically driven by the speciﬁcation of the
system, and an experienced designer could easily make an educated choice, based
the drawbacks and advantages of each topology. For inexperienced designers (or as
part of an effort to streamline the receiver design ﬂow fully), the help of compu-
tational intelligence could be sought to aid the choice. For example, the fuzzy logic
toolbox in MATLAB could be used to implement a system where the selection of
receiver architecture from a pool of receiver solutions is performed, based on
certain predetermined rules. Rules can be set up based on characteristics such as
selectivity,
analog
requirements,
ﬂexibility,
noise
and
integrateability.
For
millimeter-wave applications, these rules must be extended to include the assess-
ment
on
how
well
the
particular
topology
can
be
implemented
in
the
millimeter-wave regime as well.
9.5.2
Receiver Chain Parameter Distribution
Slightly more challenging is the task of determining the parameter distribution
along receiver chains. Typically, the intent is to achieve good noise ﬁgure as well as
to provide sufﬁcient overall gain, while keeping linearity intact. The task of opti-
mizing these parameters has proven to be complex even for one ampliﬁcation stage,
and the complexity increases with the addition of extra ampliﬁcation stages.
In Chap. 2, the equation for the noise factor of the cascaded system was derived:
Fc ¼ F1 þ F2  1
G1
þ F3  1
G1G2
þ 	 	 	 þ
Fn  1
G1G2. . .Gn1
;
ð9:6Þ
where G1, G2,…, Gn−1 and F1, F2,…, Fn are the gains and noise factors of indi-
vidual ampliﬁer stages. Similarly, the equation for the IIP3 point of the cascaded
system can be derived [17]:

where IIP3,1, IIP3,2,…, IIP3,n are the IIP3 points of the individual ampliﬁer stages.
The same equation holds for other intercept points, if all IIP3,i are replaced by IIPk,i,
where k is the order of the intercept point. Inspection of Eqs. (9.6) and (9.7) makes
it clear that optimization of the receiver system is by no means a task that should be
done by hand.
The optimization, however, can be done by once again deploying genetic
algorithms. Ivanciu and Oltean [17] suggest the Hybrid- Fuzzy-GA solution to
parameter distribution deployed in MATLAB. In this work, the ampliﬁer is opti-
mized for gain and noise ﬁgure, as well as for IIP2 and IIP3 for ﬁve ampliﬁcation
stages, but it is suggested that the approach can be extended to any number of
stages.
In order to reach the proposed block speciﬁcations of every ampliﬁcation stage,
techniques for LNA optimization and design described in Sect. 9.4 can be adapted
and incorporated in the receiver optimization exercise.
9.6
Concluding Remarks
In this chapter, the use of custom in-house EDA in conjunction with commercial
EDA for the design of optimized LNA conﬁgurations was presented. Techniques
for optimization and streamlining of passives, matching networks and LNA stages
were all presented. These techniques involved developing simple procedures for the
design of these components that take into account all factors that could result in
suboptimum designs. In the case of passive devices, subroutines for the design of
integrated spiral inductors, bond wires and discrete toroidal inductors, as well as
microstrip lines, were illustrated. Each subroutine used equations applicable to the
particular model. Procedures for toroid and bond wire design turned out to be very
simple to implement in programs such as MATLAB, while for spiral inductor
design, search or genetic algorithms alongside regular calculations were needed. It
was therefore demonstrated that LNAs can be optimized by optimizing their parts;
in this case, the passives used in the design.
Later in the chapter, it was also shown how the whole LNA system can also be
optimized and the design ﬂow can be streamlined with the aid of EDA. The
optimization techniques can also be extended to complete receiver solutions, as was
also investigated in this chapter.
This chapter is the penultimate chapter of this book. In Chap. 10, the conclu-
sions with regard to research in this book will be drawn and ﬁnal remarks will be
presented.

Evaluation of the Hypothesis and Research
Questions, Final Remarks and Future
Research
Abstract This is the concluding chapter of this book and the hypothesis proposed
in Chap. 1 is critically evaluated and the research questions are answered. The
chapter also looks at the remaining research gaps and the opportunities for LNA
enhancement, as well as future directions. In the concluding section, the authors’
own proposal for a streamlined LNA design is given.
10.1
Evaluation of the Hypothesis and Research Questions
The research questions and the hypothesis are criticized in this section.
10.1.1
Research Question 1
The ﬁrst research question explored how much understanding of millimeter-
wave-frequency operation fundamentals and fundamentals of propagation can assist
in optimum LNA design at these frequencies.
The millimeter-wave regime was explored in Chap. 2 in detail, where the
groundwork was laid for understanding of the critical millimeter-wave considera-
tions used in the later chapters, more speciﬁcally in Part II of the book. Therefore,
understanding of the millimeter-wave operation fundamentals proved paramount
for millimeter-wave LNA design.
10.1.2
Research Question 2
The second research question explored the types of parameters of state-of-the art
LNAs that can be improved on by optimization via more advanced models, whether
of complete systems or parts of the systems.

329

State-of-the-art LNAs were explored in Chap. 7 and discrepancies between
predicted, simulated and measured results of the determining LNA performance
parameters were often identiﬁed. These included all key parameters, such as the
gain, noise ﬁgure, linearity and even bandwidth. Therefore, the improved compo-
nent modeling, as well as the modeling of the complete systems, both emerged as
suitable ways of optimizing complex LNA designs. Modeling of active and passive
devices was explored in several chapters of Part I, while some more advanced
discussions were conducted in Chap. 8 in Part II.
10.1.3
Research Question 3
The third research question investigated the relationship between the performance
of a typical LNA and its parts, and how the performance can be improved through
improvement of its building blocks or blocks that precede it: transistors, passives,
packaging, antennas.
Numerous case studies in Chap. 7, but also in Chaps. 8 and 9, illustrated the
strong dependence between the performances of the LNA building blocks and the
complete LNA systems.
10.1.4
Research Question 4
The fourth and last research question led to an investigation into the ability of the
efforts to improve EDA to assist in achieving optimized LNAs.
In Chap. 9, it was demonstrated that custom-developed EDA procedures can be
used in synergy with the existing EDA tools to utilize the existing (available)
components to design LNAs that are performing better than LNAs that do not
utilize this approach.
10.1.5
The Hypothesis
Finally, the hypothesis in Chap. 1 speculated that if the performance of an LNA at
millimeter-wave frequencies could be dissected into parts contributing to its per-
formance, then by improving the performance of its parts, improved performance of
the complete LNA system would be achieved.
The complete LNA system was shown to consist of several ampliﬁcation stages,
connected together and to the blocks that come prior to the LNA (e.g. the antenna)
and after the LNA (e.g. the demodulator) using matching networks. It was fur-
thermore shown that a number of active and passive components are used as
building components (parts). The technology of implementation, layout, bonding,

the packaging or integration options, and other associated tasks directly inﬂuence
the ultimate LNA performance and they, therefore, can also be considered as LNA
building blocks. Thereafter, it was demonstrated that most of the building blocks
can be optimized; it was also shown that the connections among the parts can be
optimized. Finally, it was demonstrated that by optimizing all the parts and the
system as a whole, highly performing LNAs can be achieved. Therefore, the set
hypothesis was proven true.
10.2
Remaining Research Gaps and Opportunities
for Enhancement
In Chap. 9 it was shown that, with careful possibly EDA assisted research, popular
LNA topologies, or state-of-the-art topologies explored in Chap. 7, can be pushed
close to the limits set by the fabrication of packaging technologies. For achieving
even better results, additional steps need to be taken, typically in the direction of
technology change, better quality passives, or exploration of high-end packages.
Some emerging technologies were explored in Chap. 8, but it is clear that the quest
for the ideal LNA will continue for some time, even for frequencies at the lower end
of the millimeter-wave band:
• Research into new fabrication technologies that can support millimeter-wave
operation or even THz operation continues.
• With different technologies that can be used for active and passive devices,
research into better performing packaging technologies also needs to continue.
Research into different packaging options, such as SiP, SoP and 3-D tech-
nologies, will continue to coexist.
• In more advanced technologies, the devices start behaving differently than
predicted with currently available models. Therefore, in parallel to technology
research, the modeling also needs to be constantly updated and kept in sync. In
low-technology modes, the actual behavior of the transistor changes, which calls
for both improved simple small-signal models and very complex simulation
models, including RF and EM simulation models.
• Although a large number of topologies were presented throughout this book,
there is clarity on the fact that a single topology is not capable of simultaneously
delivering repeatable performance across multiple frequencies or increasing
bandwidths. Therefore, research into new and innovative topologies will also
have to continue for some time to come.
• The current behavior pattern of society indicates that bandwidth demands are
only going to increase in the future. The amount of available bandwidth can
only be increased with an increase in the frequency of the channel; it was shown
that high-bandwidth channels are located at the higher “end” of the allocated
frequency spectrum. Although for now the millimeter-wave range can support
10.1
Evaluation of the Hypothesis and Research Questions
331

high bandwidths, research into LNAs operating at ever-increasing frequencies
also has to continue.
10.3
Future Directions
With more and more research being conducted into the millimeter-wave band
operation of LNAs and other circuits, the focus is slowly shifting away from RF and
microwave operation. Millimeter-wave research is probably now at the stage where
RF and microwave research was about twenty years ago. Therefore, the natural
conclusion can be drawn that in the near future, the focus is going to shift once
more, this time to THz and optoelectronic circuit operation. To make this feasible,
the research gaps mentioned in the previous section need to be closed ﬁrst. The
question of feasibility of communication at frequencies of 300 GHz and above will,
however, remain, because of the difﬁculties associated with THz-wave propagation.
10.4
Concluding Proposal: Streamlined Flow
for Low-Noise Ampliﬁer Design Deploying Custom
Electronic Design Automation
This book is concluded with a proposal for a streamlined approach to the LNA
design. From the discussions in this book and in this chapter, several steps can be
identiﬁed that need to be taken in the LNA design process in the millimeter-wave
regime and otherwise, to achieve the ﬁnal functional design in the minimum time
possible. The steps may sound obvious, but this is not always apparent, so it could
be worthwhile to outline the ﬂow in a formal manner.
Thus, the LNA full design procedure can be carried out as follows:
1. Decide on the receiver and/or LNA topology that best suits the given speciﬁ-
cations. Depending on the speciﬁcations, such as the frequency of operation or
whether the design is to be wideband or narrowband, simple topologies pre-
sented in Chaps. 5 and 6, or complex topologies as reviewed as a part of the
state-of-the art conﬁgurations (Chap. 7), can be explored.
2. Synthesize and optimize the design using custom-developed EDA routines,
adapted from the procedures presented in Chap. 9. At least two approaches are
possible here: the ﬁrst is to develop a separate LNA design routine and, where
applicable, use the EDA routines for optimization of passives and matching
networks. Alternatively, one can develop a routine that fully streamlines the
LNA design ﬂow, including the physical design (e.g. input and output match-
ing), as well as any passives.

3. Validate the circuit in the time and frequency domain. The initial validation is
done by means of simulations, using idealized components to verify that the
analytic solution is correct.
4. Modify the design if necessary; repeat the simulations until satisfactory per-
formance has been achieved.
5. Perform accurate modeling of all components, connections, signal tracks,
packaging, etc. Then repeat the simulations with these more advanced models.
In this step, one needs to try to absorb the parasitics in the design components,
or attempt to compensate for the losses by modifying the design speciﬁcations.
Wherever possible, EM simulations should be executed (e.g. on passives, tracks,
packaging), and the design should be updated based on the results of EM
simulations. Simulations for the updated design are repeated once more, until
satisfactory results are reached.
6. Perform the ﬁnal simulation of the complete system and execute the physical
design. The physical design refers to layouts of the IC prototype.
7. If possible, simulate the physical design (layouts), correct the design if appli-
cable and repeat simulations. In this step, the advanced models that cannot be
extracted by layout netlister (e.g. the packaging) should still be included.
The ﬂow is illustrated graphically in Fig. 10.1.
Steps 1 and 2 are typically the steps that require the largest portion of
hand-design effort. With streamlining in terms of EDA, a considerable amount of
effort is removed from the design ﬂow. In addition, conﬁgurations will have better
performance ﬁgures than those achieved when design is done by hand. This is
where a typical designer will see most beneﬁt in taking the approach discussed in
this book (concluding in Chap. 9). The remainder of the process (steps 3–7) remains
iterative; however, the number of iterations decreases signiﬁcantly with this
approach.
