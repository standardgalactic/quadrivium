Introduction
O
bsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) was once thought to be very rare. 
Now, most estimates suggest that from 2.5 to more than 3.5 percent of 
adults suffer from OCD. That means that more than 3 million people in the 
United States and many millions more throughout the rest of the world have 
OCD. Furthermore, the diagnosis of childhood OCD has been mushrooming 
in the past several decades.
So, why the apparent increase in OCD? Well, part of the reason is that we do 
a better job of diagnosing the disorder. Another reason we see more OCD 
today is that people are more willing to admit to having problems. Other 
factors may be involved as well, such as stress associated with modern life. 
Perhaps even advertising makes a contribution, as we explain next.
For example, when your flight is delayed for hours, filling the time can be 
quite a challenge. Like us, you probably dread coming to the end of a novel, 
magazine, or movie brought to distract yourself from the endless waiting.
Perhaps, after hours of waiting, you resort to mindlessly pulling out the catalog 
of gadgets, gizmos, and gifts found in every seatback. Next time you’re bored, 
reach for that catalog and take a look at the advertisements for sanitizing 
devices. Many of these devices use UV lights and are touted as portable tools for 
disinfecting all sorts of surfaces, such as countertops, keyboards, cellphones, 
handrails, public toilets, toothbrushes, desktops, doorknobs, and even armrests 
on airplane seats. With the wave of a wand, the lights apparently destroy 99.9 
percent of all bacteria, viruses, and molds — including E. coli, SARS, and 
salmonella — in about ten seconds.
Picture the world if everyone carried one of those light wands around. 
Imagine millions of people scanning everything in their environment that 
might have some hidden contaminants. Would the world become a safer, 
cleaner, less contaminated place? What if you added spray disinfectants, 
hand sanitizers, and face masks to the mix? You might avoid a few colds or 
bouts of the flu. But hold on, if you avoid all germs, studies show that your 
body’s immune system may not develop antibodies that combat illness. So 
maybe all that decontaminating isn’t so great after all.
Nevertheless, those ads can make you feel a little creepy with all their claims 
about germs, microbes, and bacteria — especially when you’re sitting on an 
airplane, maybe sweating a bit, smelling the bad breath of the guy next to 
you, and listening to the hacking coughs, sneezes, and other enjoyable noises 
of your fellow passengers. We’re not saying that travel hassles cause OCD or 
that advertising makes it worse. However, media’s obsessional attention to

the dangers of dirt and germs sells lots of products and provides grist for the 
OCD mind.
About This Book
This book is about OCD. Our goals are to help you understand OCD as well as 
give you strategies for getting help and getting better. We also tell you what 
you can do to help a child or someone you care about who has OCD. We dis-
cuss the symptoms of other conditions, such as anxiety or depression, that 
can occur at the same time as OCD. In addition, we explain the differences 
and similarities of disorders that can be considered cousins of OCD.
Throughout the book we give you tips on when to consider getting more help 
from a mental-health professional. We provide sources and ways for you to 
choose the right person to assist your recovery.
This book covers the primary strategies used to treat OCD, including 
Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT), mindfulness, exposure and response 
prevention (ERP), and medication. The information is based on the latest sci-
entific research.
An Important Message to Our Readers
This is the fifth book we’ve written in the For Dummies series. As with our other 
books, our intention is to share the latest and most accurate information about 
OCD, as well as to provide tools for effectively dealing with the symptoms.
We also want to keep your interest and provide a little entertainment, so we 
try to put a bit of humor in our writing. Sometimes we laugh at what we write, 
and we hope you will, too. But keep in mind that we are very aware that OCD 
is a serious and painful disorder. We only want to make you smile.
Conventions Used in This Book
Case examples are used throughout this book to illustrate points. These 
stories are based on symptoms, thoughts, and feelings from real people with 
OCD. However, the individual illustrations are composites of people rather 
than recognizable examples. The case examples leave out or change many 
details so that privacy and confidentiality are protected. Any resemblance to 
any person, whether alive or deceased, is entirely coincidental. We bold the 
names of people the first time they appear in order to alert you to the fact 
that we are presenting a case example.

3
 Introduction
Other conventions you’ll see throughout the book include the following:
 
 In addition to introducing examples (as noted previously), bold indi-
cates the action parts in numbered steps. It also emphasizes keywords 
in a bulleted list.
 
 Italicized terms are immediately followed by definitions.
 
 When we use acronyms (like OCD), we tell you what they mean the first 
time they’re used in each chapter. If we miss one or two, please com-
plain to our editors — after all, they’re really the ones at fault!
 
 Web addresses show up in monofont.
 
 When this book was printed, some Web addresses may have needed 
to break across two lines of text. Rest assured that we haven’t put in 
any extra characters (such as hyphens) to indicate the break. Just type 
in exactly what you see in this book, pretending the line break doesn’t 
exist.
What Not to Read
This book is full of information and every word is well worth reading (and 
recommending to your family and friends). But you really don’t have to read 
every single word, sentence, or chapter to benefit. You can use the table of 
contents or index to look up what you want to know. There is no predeter-
mined order to the chapters; you can read them in any order you choose. 
Sometimes, we suggest going back or checking out certain chapters or sec-
tions for more information, but that’s up to you.
Sidebars throughout the book provide you with what we think are interest-
ing bits of information. Feel free to skip one or all of them if you’re in a hurry. 
Along the same lines, we have some technical stuff (indicated by the icon of 
the same name) that explains material in greater detail; don’t feel like you 
have to be obsessional about reading that, either.
Foolish Assumptions
If you’re reading this paragraph, we suspect that you may be holding this 
book in your hands (now that was a brilliant deduction). Maybe you’re 
interested in OCD because you think you have some symptoms. Or maybe 
you worry that someone you care about has OCD. Perhaps you’re simply 
intrigued by this very interesting disorder (possibly having seen it portrayed 
in movies or on television).

Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder For Dummies 
You may be a mental-health professional who wants to find out more about 
specific treatment options for OCD or look at books that may be helpful to 
your clients. Or you may be a student of psychology, counseling, social work, 
or psychiatry hoping to get a clearer picture of this complex problem.
Whatever reason you have for picking up this book, we promise a compre-
hensive depiction of everything you need to know about OCD.
How This Book Is Organized
We divide Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder For Dummies into 7 parts, 25 chapters, 
and 2 appendixes. Following is a brief overview of the content of each part.
Part I: The Ins and Outs of OCD
Part I describes what OCD looks like. It tells you about the different types 
of OCD and some of the common and not-so-common symptoms. The third 
chapter describes other disorders that some professionals believe are 
related to OCD. We tell you what they are and why they may be part of what 
is known as the OCD spectrum. Chapters 4 and 5 tackle the biological and 
psychological causes of OCD. The specific causes of OCD remain a mystery, 
but many believe biology and psychology both play a role.
Part II: Starting Down the Treatment Path
Chapter 6 explains why so many people want to get help but can’t seem to 
get going. Mental-health professionals call it resistance — putting the brakes 
on change. Some people are afraid of change, while others believe them-
selves incapable of change. We help you find the motivation for moving for-
ward and tackling OCD.
Chapter 7 tells you who’s who in the treatment field. It spells out what to 
expect if you decide to seek professional help. This chapter also shows you 
how to evaluate your choice of a mental-health professional.
Part III: Overcoming OCD
This part contains the meat and potatoes — the different treatment 
approaches to OCD. We cover in depth the techniques that are usually 
referred to as Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT). Cognitive refers to how 
you think and how that can contribute to OCD. How the way you think effects 

5
 Introduction
you and how to change are discussed in Chapter 8. Chapter 9 looks at how 
mindfulness, becoming more aware of the present moment, can help you 
decrease symptoms of OCD. The gold standard of OCD treatment, exposure 
and response prevention (ERP) is the behavior part of CBT. We explain how 
it works and how to implement ERP in Chapter 10.
Chapter 11 takes a close look at the different types of medication that are 
commonly prescribed for OCD. Finally, Chapter 12 tells you about relapse — 
what to watch out for and how to deal with relapse if it occurs.
Part IV: Targeting Specific 
Symptoms of OCD
The seven chapters in this part take a closer look at specific types of OCD and 
how to treat them. We give you examples of treatment plans for widely diverse 
problems, such as a need for symmetry or counting, doubting and checking, 
hoarding, and superstitious thinking. The final chapter gives you advice on 
treatments for related disorders, such as hair-pulling and skin-picking.
Part V: Assisting Others with OCD
OCD often begins in childhood. The first chapter in this part helps you deter-
mine whether your child has symptoms that suggest OCD. It also helps you 
find a good mental-health professional for evaluating and treating your child. 
Chapter 21 describes how parents or concerned family members can help a 
child with OCD. Although we suggest that parents enlist the help of a profes-
sional, there are many things parents can do to support therapy and their 
child. The last chapter in this section gives you tips on becoming a coach for 
someone else with OCD, including the dos and don’ts.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
Turn to these quick chapters for a little fun. You can read about quick fixes, 
find out how to move beyond OCD, and get some dirt on dirt.
Part VII: Appendixes
Appendix A contains important additional resources about OCD. We give you 
lists of books and Web sites you may want to review. Appendix B provides a 
few forms that you can use for some of the exercises we describe in various 
chapters. Feel free to make copies for your own use.

This icon gives you information that you want to take from the discussion and 
file away in your brain, even if you remember nothing else. It’s also used to 
remind you of important information that appears elsewhere in the book.
 
This icon lays out material that we think is rather interesting or cool, but not 
needed for understanding the essentials.
 
This icon indicates lists that can be used to develop ERP staircases. This 
technique is introduced in Chapter 10 and repeated in a number of chapters 
that address specific forms of OCD.
Where to Go from Here
We expect that reading this book will thoroughly inform you about OCD and 
related disorders. The book spells out the major treatment strategies for 
OCD. We hope you find the text interesting and, at times, entertaining.
If you are reading this book to help you overcome OCD, we encourage you 
to get a notebook, write out the exercises, take notes, and reflect upon your 
efforts.
Unless you’re reading this book for your own interest or education (and not 
because you have OCD), you’re likely to want to consult a professional as 
well. We expect that most trained mental-health professionals will welcome 
the opportunity to work with you on the strategies outlined in this book.

epending on how you define the terms, everyone has a few obsessive or 
compulsive traits. In popular vernacular, obsessive is a word often used 
to describe someone’s intense interest in something. For example, a man who 
stalks a movie star is totally obsessed with her. Or a woman who spends hours 
putting on her make-up and doing her hair obsesses about her looks. An obses-
sion also can refer to an intense interest in a sport, a hobby, or a career. On 
the other hand, compulsive often is used to refer to rigid patterns of behavior, 
as reflected in descriptions such as “He is compulsive about keeping his house 
clean,” or, “She compulsively balances her checkbook every week without fail.”
But mental-health professionals define these terms quite differently. In the 
mental-health field, obsessions are considered to be unwanted thoughts, 
images, or impulses that occur frequently and are upsetting to the person 
who has them. Compulsions are various actions or rituals that a person 
performs in order to reduce the feelings of distress caused by obsessions.
You can find examples of obsessions and compulsions in lots of places. For 
example, many major-league pitchers have elaborate good-luck rituals that can 
look pretty strange. Some feel compelled to hear the same song prior to the 
game; others eat exactly the same food. You probably have watched pitchers 
straighten their hats, smooth out the dirt on the mound, and spit in the sand 
before each pitch. Many baseball hitters have elaborate rituals they carry out 
with their bats. Other athletes have strange beliefs, good-luck charms, or com-
pulsive acts that they must perform, allegedly to help their performance. If you 
are a major-league sports player making zillions of dollars to play a game, you 
can indulge in a few weird behaviors. No one will bother you.

10
Part I: The Ins and Outs of OCD 
 
Anyone can have a few obsessions or compulsions, and, in fact, most people 
do. But it isn’t obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) unless the obsessions 
and compulsions consume considerable amounts of time and interfere 
significantly with the quality of your life.
In this chapter, we introduce you to OCD. We reveal how it debilitates indi-
viduals who have it and what it costs society. We also provide an overview of 
the major treatment options — much can be done for OCD nowadays. Finally, 
because OCD treatment can be greatly enhanced by the help of friends and 
family, we provide tips on what you can do to help someone you care about 
who has OCD.
What Is OCD?
OCD has many faces. Millions of people are held prisoner by the strange 
thoughts and feelings caused by this disorder. Most people with OCD are 
bright and intelligent. But doubt, uneasiness, and fear hijack their normally 
good, logical minds.
Whether or not you have OCD, you can probably recall a time when you felt 
great dread. Imagine standing at the edge of an airplane about to take your 
first parachute jump. The wind is blowing; your stomach is churning; you’re 
breathing hard. Suddenly the pilot screams, “Stop! Don’t jump! The chute is 
not attached!”
You waver at the edge, terrified, and fall back into the plane, shaking. That’s 
how many people with OCD feel every day. OCD makes their brains believe 
that something horrible is going to happen. Some people fear that they left 
an appliance on and the house will burn down. Others are terrified that they 
may get infected with some unknown germ. OCD causes good, kind people 
to believe that they might do something horrible to a child, knock over an 
elderly person, or run over someone with their car.
Those with OCD almost always struggle with two major issues: shame and the 
intense desire to avoid all risks. We discuss these issues in the next two sections.
Suffering shame
Because the thoughts and behaviors of those with OCD are so unusual or 
socially unacceptable, people with OCD feel deeply embarrassed and ashamed. 
Imagine having the thought that you might be sexually attracted to a statue of 
a saint in your church. The thought bursts into your mind as you walk by the 
statue. Or consider how you would feel if you stood at a crosswalk and had an 
image come into your mind of pushing someone into oncoming traffic.

11
 Chapter 1: Reviewing Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)
However, the frightening, disturbing thoughts of OCD are not based on real-
ity. People with OCD have these thoughts because their OCD minds produce 
them, not because they are evil or malicious. It is extremely rare for someone 
with OCD to actually carry out a shameful act.
 
Throughout this book we often refer to the “OCD mind” rather than you or some-
one you care about with OCD. The reason we do that is to emphasize that you 
are not your OCD. You have these thoughts, urges, impulses, and rituals because 
of a problem with the way your brain works. OCD is not your fault.
Wrestling with risk
The OCD mind attempts to avoid risks of all kinds almost all the time. That’s 
why those with Contamination OCD spend many hours every single day 
cleaning, scrubbing, and sanitizing everything around them. People with 
Superstitious OCD perform rituals to keep them safe over and over again. 
Interestingly, most OCD sufferers focus on reducing risks around specific 
themes such as contamination, household safety, the safety of loved ones, or 
offending God. But those with contamination fears don’t necessarily worry 
about damnation. And those who worry about turning the stove off usually 
don’t obsess about germs.
Risks of all kinds abound in life. We don’t know of any human who has 
avoided the ultimate worry — death. And no one can ever know when death 
is about to knock on the door. The following famous people were living their 
lives with normal precautions and died of random, unexpected events:
 
 Felix Faure: The president of France died in 1899 from a stroke while 
having sex.
 
 Isadora Duncan: A dancer, Isadora was strangled to death when her silk 
scarf was entangled in the wheel of a car in which she was a passenger.
 
 Sherwood Anderson: This famous author died after he accidentally 
swallowed a toothpick at a party.
 
 Tennessee Williams: A playwright, Williams accidentally choked to 
death on the bottle cap of his nose spray.
 
 Vic Morrow: An actor, Morrow was decapitated while making a movie 
when a helicopter went out of control and crashed.
Given scenarios like those in the preceding list, it’s hard to imagine how OCD 
rituals and behaviors could actually anticipate and save anyone from similar 
circumstances. But the OCD mind tries to create the illusion that almost all 
risks can be anticipated and avoided.

12
Part I: The Ins and Outs of OCD 
In truth, OCD doesn’t provide significant protection in spite of extraordinary 
efforts to reduce risks. In chapters to come, we give you ideas about how to 
accept a certain amount of risk in order to live a full life, no matter how long 
or short that life is.
Counting the Costs of OCD
People with OCD suffer. They are more likely than others to have other emo-
tional disorders such as depression or anxiety. Due to embarrassment, they 
often keep their symptoms secret for years, which prevents them from seek-
ing treatment. Worldwide, it is estimated that almost 60 percent of people 
with OCD never get help.
The pain of OCD is accompanied by loneliness. OCD disrupts relationships. 
People with OCD are less likely to marry, and, if they do, they are more likely 
to divorce than others. Those who do hang on to their families often have 
more conflict.
OCD also costs money. A study done in the ’90s reported that the estimated 
price tag of OCD was over 8 billion dollars in the United States alone. This 
amount represents the cost of treatment, lost productivity on the job, and 
lost days at work. Even with improved treatments, these costs have no doubt 
risen along with increased population and healthcare costs.
Encouraging OCD through the Media
OCD is not a new disorder. However, you can’t help but think that the appetite 
for sensation in the media accelerates OCD concerns. Recently, we saw a tele-
vision special about people buying used mattresses. Reporters used special 
lights and took cultures to find all sorts of horrible matter (bed bugs, fecal 
matter, and body fluids) still clinging to supposedly refurbished bedding.
In another show, zealous reporters burst into hotel rooms armed with 
petri dishes and black lights to help them find filth and grime on the glasses 
left in the room, as well as on the carpet and bedding. Media also warns 
about such dangers as inadvertently inhaling gasoline fumes while pumping 
gas (of course, who can afford that anymore?) and kindergarten children 
inadvertently becoming intoxicated from magic markers.
Furthermore, the sales of cleaning products, sanitizers, personal hygiene 
products, and mouthwash have soared over the years. You can find antibac-
terial ingredients in products designed to clean your refrigerator, mop your 
floors, scrub your body, and disinfect your toilets. Antiviral ingredients are 
also becoming quite the rage.

13
 Chapter 1: Reviewing Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)
Yet, try and find solid evidence about deaths from refurbished mattresses, 
less-than-pristine hotel rooms, incidental exposure to fumes, and homes not 
cleaned with every antibacterial and antiviral ingredient known to humans, 
and you’ll come up wanting. In fact, a clever study conducted by researchers 
at Columbia University in Manhattan provided households with free cleaning 
supplies, laundry detergent, and hand-washing products. All the brand names 
were removed. Half of the households were given products with antibacte-
rial properties and the other half was provided supplies without antibacterial 
properties. The researchers carefully tracked the incidence of infectious dis-
eases (runny noses, colds, boils, coughs, fever, sore throats, vomiting, 
diarrhea, and conjunctivitis) for almost a year. They found no differences 
between those who used antibacterial cleaning agents and those who did not.
 
If you spend loads of time cleaning and using antibacterial disinfectants, you 
may be doing yourself more harm than good! Scientists now believe that 
excessively clean environments may actually be causing an increase in aller-
gies and asthma. Furthermore, excessive use of antibiotics appears to run 
some risk of encouraging the development of new, resistant bacteria.
No, we are not suggesting that people stop washing their hands — especially in 
hospitals! And we’re well aware of the long-term dangers posed by prolonged 
exposure to air pollution, insecticides, and toxic chemicals. Furthermore, we’re 
grossed out by a dirty hotel room as much as anyone else. At the same time, 
the media and advertisers have shown a disturbing obsession with issues 
involving excessive cleanliness and minimal exposure to low-level risks.
Germs: Resistance is futile
Some people with OCD spend hours vacuum-
ing in hopes of defeating dust and dirt in their 
homes. However, research led by Dr. Charles 
Gerba at the University of Arizona found that 
household vacuum cleaners not only may 
spread germs throughout the house, but also 
may be a safe haven for accumulating bacte-
ria. Vacuum brushes apparently harbor fecal 
material, mold, and even E. coli. What to do 
about this situation? One recommendation has 
been to spray antibacterial disinfectant on your 
vacuum brushes after every use. Another solu-
tion is to buy a new breed of vacuum that pur-
portedly kills bacteria and germs through the 
use of an ultraviolet, germicidal light.
Other researchers have found bacteria and 
fecal matter in ice machines at restaurants and 
on restaurant menus. Therefore, some suggest 
not using ice machines, not allowing a menu to 
touch your plate, and washing your hands after 
selecting your food from the infected menu.
The problem with these studies and recom-
mendations is that no one has proven that any 
of these sources cause significant amounts of 
illness or disease. Though reasonable precau-
tions are always a good idea, you can easily 
start down the disinfectant road and never 
return. Bacteria and germs exist everywhere. 
You cannot eliminate all of them, and you can 
spend huge amounts of time and money trying.

Part I: The Ins and Outs of OCD 
Exploring Treatment Options for OCD
If you had OCD during the Middle Ages, you very well may have been referred 
to a priest for an exorcism. The strange, violent, sexual, or blasphemous 
thoughts and behaviors characteristic of OCD were thought to derive from 
the devil. If you had OCD during the dawn of the 20th century, you may have 
been sent for treatment based on Freudian psychoanalysis, which purport-
edly resolved unconscious conflicts from early development. For example, if 
your OCD involved sexual obsessions or compulsions, you were assumed to 
have unconscious desires for your mother or father. In fact, the common use 
of the word “anal” to describe people who are overly rigid, controlled, and 
uptight came from the Freudian idea that strict, early toilet training caused 
children to grow up with excessive concerns about neatness and rules.
However, neither exorcism nor psychoanalysis ultimately proved to have 
much impact on OCD. Only in the last 40 years or so have effective treat-
ments evolved for OCD. And some of these treatments have only become 
widely available quite recently.
In the next few sections we provide an overview of the major treatment 
options for OCD that have shown significant promise based on scientific 
studies. For clarity, we have divided these therapies into the categories of 
CBT, mindfulness, ERP, and medications. In reality, rarely are any of these 
therapies used as a single, exclusive treatment for OCD.
What’s in a name?
Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is a general 
term referring to a collection of techniques that 
aim to improve well-being by bringing about spe-
cific changes in the way you think and behave. 
Throughout this book, we use this more encom-
passing term. (We discuss CBT in detail in Chapter 
8.) But sometimes we in the mental-health field 
get a little persnickety. So, just to keep things 
straight, we provide a bit more information here 
than most readers really need.
Cognitive Therapy (CT) refers to methods 
primarily aimed at changes in thinking. Behavior 
Therapy (BT) focuses on making various behav-
ioral changes. Exposure and response preven-
tion (ERP), the subject of Chapter 10, is one 
specific form of BT. Just to confuse you a little 
more, mindfulness, which we cover in Chapter 
9, is often considered a variant or offshoot of 
CBT. You will almost always see at least some 
small degree of ERP or other CBT techniques 
included in any given treatment of OCD, even if 
the approach goes by a single term such as ERP 
or Cognitive Therapy.

15
 Chapter 1: Reviewing Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)
Changing the way you think with CBT
Cognitive therapy was developed by Dr. Aaron Beck in the early 1960s and is 
a major component of the broader term, Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy.
Originally, this approach was used to treat depression. Cognitive therapy is 
based on the idea that the way you feel is largely determined by the way you 
think or the way you interpret events. Therefore, treatment involves learning 
to identify when your thoughts contain distortions or errors that contribute 
to your misery. After you’ve identified those distortions, you can learn to 
think in more adaptive ways. Soon after it was adopted for treating depres-
sion, cognitive therapy was applied quite successfully to anxiety disorders 
and, ultimately, to a dizzying array of emotional problems, including eating 
disorders, oppositional defiant disorder, and even schizophrenia.
In the early years, cognitive therapy was not applied to OCD, perhaps because 
of the success of ERP (described in the section “Modifying behavior through 
ERP”). However, in recent years, the cognitive therapy component of CBT has 
been found to be quite effective in treating OCD. Usually, CBT includes at least 
some elements of ERP. Some practitioners believe that applying cognitive strat-
egies first may make the application of ERP somewhat more comfortable and 
acceptable to the person contemplating that approach. See Chapters 8, 9, and 
10 for more information about the various subtypes of CBT.
Approaching OCD mindfully
The OCD mind focuses on possible future calamities. The predictions almost 
never come true. Yet, the obsessive thoughts keep coming and demanding 
attention.
 
 I worry about shouting obscenities, so maybe someday I’ll lose control and 
do it in church.
 
 Maybe my thoughts of death will cause harm to someone I love.
 
 Perhaps touching that doorknob will make me sick.
When it isn’t thinking about the future, the OCD mind dwells on possibilities 
from the past. The mind fills with thoughts about what might have occurred.
 
 Maybe I left the stove on.
 
 Maybe I ran that person over with my car.
 
 Perhaps I was poisoned by that tuna fish sandwich.

16
Part I: The Ins and Outs of OCD 
Furthermore, the OCD mind judges people, the world, and even OCD itself 
harshly.
 
 A bad thought is just the same as doing something bad.
 
 Having OCD thoughts means that I’m crazy.
 
 I am a weak person for having these thoughts.
Mindfulness is the practice of existing in the present moment without judg-
ment or harsh evaluations. Thus, as you acquire a mindful approach to OCD, 
you understand that thoughts are truly just that — thoughts. Thoughts do 
not make someone good or bad. See Chapter 9 for more information about 
how to apply mindfulness to your life and your OCD. As you do, you will 
become more self-accepting and better able to quiet your OCD mind.
Modifying behavior through ERP
A true breakthrough in the treatment of OCD occurred in the mid 1960s when 
Victor Meyer tested a treatment called exposure and response prevention 
(ERP) with two patients suffering from severe cases of OCD. These patients 
had not improved with shock therapy, supportive therapy, or medication. 
The drastic measure of brain surgery was even being considered. One of the 
patients was obsessed with cleaning. Dr. Meyer and a nurse exposed this 
patient to dirt and did not allow her to clean (ergo, the term “exposure and 
response prevention”). This radical treatment was the first to help decrease 
the patient’s symptoms. The other patient was obsessed with blasphemous 
thoughts. She was told to purposefully rehearse those thoughts without doing 
the rituals that she had used to decrease her obsessions. Like the first patient, 
this woman was helped by ERP after years of other unsuccessful therapies.
ERP resulted in a substantial reduction in both patients’ OCD. The mental-
health profession took notice because OCD treatments previously had shown 
little ability to ameliorate this disorder. Suddenly, the prognosis for OCD 
turned from utterly grim to quite hopeful.
However, ERP requires patients (and sometimes therapists) to get down-and-
dirty — literally. Thus, patients may be asked to:
 
 Not check the door locks
 
 Refrain from cleaning up
 
 Repeat blasphemous thoughts over and over
 
 Say the number “13” over and over again
 
 Shake hands

17
 Chapter 1: Reviewing Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)
 
 Stop arranging their closets in certain ways
 
 Touch grimy surfaces
You may wonder whether carrying out ERP causes some distress. Indeed it does. 
Perhaps that’s why the strategy took quite a while to be embraced by large num-
bers of mental-health professionals. However, the discomfort is worth it because 
ERP is very effective. You can read all about this strategy in Chapter 10.
Controlling OCD with medications
Medications given for OCD had shown almost no effectiveness until Anafranil 
(Clomipramine) was found to work in 1966, a date roughly corresponding to 
when ERP was first tested. Thus, prior to 1966, about the only known strategy 
for treating OCD was psychosurgery — a rather radical approach involv-
ing the cutting of certain connections in the brain. Such surgery sometimes 
left the patient with devastating side effects, such as an inability to function 
normally. Obviously, psychosurgery was reserved for the most severe cases. 
Others were left to fend for themselves.
Today, some of the same medications used for depression (specifically, 
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or SSRIs) frequently work for OCD. 
However, they are thought to work in a different manner for OCD than they 
do for depression. The good news is that if medication is going to work, it will 
work fairly quickly for OCD.
Electrifying news in OCD treatment
Electroconvulsive Shock Therapy (ECT) has 
been used to treat severe cases of depression. 
In case you’re wondering, ECT does not seem 
to help OCD. However, a treatment that involves 
placing electrodes deep into brain structures 
shows some promise in the treatment of OCD, 
as well as depression, Parkinson’s disease, and 
other neurological disorders. A small continuing 
study at Brown University, the Cleveland Clinic, 
and the University of Leuven (in Belgium) found 
that deep brain stimulation brought at least 
some relief for all participants with severe OCD. 
However, the improvement varied a great deal, 
with study patients averaging about a one-third 
reduction in their symptoms. Nevertheless, 
these patients had proven to be highly resistant 
to other treatments, including ERP and medica-
tions. Unlike psychosurgery, deep brain stimu-
lation can be adjusted or reversed.
However, the number of studied patients 
remains small and the research is quite pre-
liminary. So we don’t recommend that you sign 
yourself up for this strategy quite yet. Give the 
researchers a few more years to study this 
approach — many studies are underway at 
this time.

18
Part I: The Ins and Outs of OCD 
The bad news is that a substantial number of people do not seem to benefit 
from medications for their OCD. And those who do benefit find that they 
relapse quickly if they discontinue the medication. Furthermore, side effects 
can be significant. For more information about the pros and cons of taking 
medication for OCD, see Chapter 11.
Helping People with OCD
If you’re reading this book because your child, a family member, or a close 
friend has OCD, there is much you can do to help. Here are a few points to 
keep in mind if you want to do more good than harm:
 
 Don’t try to be a therapist. Generally speaking, we recommend that 
those with OCD consult a mental-health professional. Those with a very 
mild case may want to try some of the techniques described in this book 
on their own. However, treatment plans should either be designed by a 
professional and/or the person with OCD. At the most, you can make a 
few suggestions. Even if you are a professional therapist, you don’t want 
to take on that role for a friend or family member.
 
 Understand OCD. Even if you’re not taking on the role of a therapist, 
knowing a lot about this disorder helps a great deal. Understanding 
OCD can help you feel compassion and acceptance for the one you care 
about. You will also know that your family member, child, or friend 
didn’t ask for OCD. No one wants to have this problem.
 
 Encourage; don’t reassure. You want to encourage the one you care 
about to participate in treatment. At the same time, you don’t want to do 
what seems natural — reassure the person that everything will be okay. 
Please read Chapter 22 to find out how to devise alternatives to giving 
reassurance.
 
 Don’t get sucked into rituals and compulsions. Those with OCD often 
try to elicit help with their rituals and compulsions. For example, they 
may ask someone to recheck that the doors are locked or that the oven 
is turned off. Though complying with the request may seem caring, 
doing so only makes matters worse.

19
 Chapter 1: Reviewing Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)
Another mushrooming approach to OCD treatment?
The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry recently 
reported on a study involving psilocybin, the 
psychoactive substance found in psychedelic 
mushrooms. Psilocybin was provided to nine 
people with severe OCD. All nine participants 
reported that they were symptom-free for peri-
ods ranging from 4 to 24 hours. A few patients 
reported sustaining symptom reductions for 
several days. However, the primary investiga-
tor, Dr. Moreno, indicated that daily ingestion of 
this drug would likely be problematic. You see, 
psychedelic mushrooms can also trigger trips 
to past lives and other planets. Therefore, this 
is not a treatment that we would recommend 
at this time. Perhaps some chemical cousin or 
derivative of psilocybin will ultimately prove to 
be an effective treatment approach to OCD, but 
don’t hold your breath.

 Knowing whether your symptoms are OCD
A
lthough it goes by a single name, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) 
is actually a diverse disorder with multiple presentations. OCD can mani-
fest itself as quirky behavior, exaggerated fears, or seriously disturbed think-
ing. Thus, in one instance, the diagnosis of OCD may be assigned to someone 
with the odd habit of hanging clothes exactly 1.2 inches apart in the closet, 
whereas in someone else, OCD may show up as excessive worries about germs 
and constant hand-washing. Alternatively, OCD could cause someone to adopt 
an endless number of cats and live in the midst of feces and filth.
You may be surprised to know that everyone occasionally has a few signs of 
OCD. And some symptoms of OCD are perfectly normal. For example, you 
may worry about whether you turned off the coffeepot, put the boarding pass 
in your briefcase, or left a light on as you rush off to the airport for an impor-
tant business trip. Your mind tells you to stop your car and turn around to 
check. But usually you don’t because you realize that the odds are pretty 
much in your favor that your worries are exaggerated.
Occasionally feeling compelled to count steps, knock on wood, or arrange 
items on your nightstand in a particular pattern is also normal. These 
actions, although possibly unwanted or a little strange, are common. Just 
because you have one or more symptoms of OCD doesn’t mean that you have 
the disorder.
In this chapter, we explain OCD in plain words and provide clear examples 
of its symptoms, sorting out what’s normal and what’s OCD. OCD has two 
components — obsessions and compulsions. We describe obsessions, and 
then we explain compulsions. Finally, we introduce and briefly describe the 
wildly divergent mutations of OCD.

22
Part I: The Ins and Outs of OCD 
 
OCD can steal the minds and dismantle the lives of those affected. Therefore, 
we take a serious and respectful approach to reviewing the diagnosis and 
treatment of OCD. At the same time, let’s face it, the OCD brain can come up 
with some wild thoughts and strange actions. These thoughts and behaviors 
may look downright bizarre, and occasionally funny, but we assure you that 
they are real and serious. Finally, we do poke fun at ourselves and occasion-
ally take a lighthearted look at OCD. However, we never, ever poke fun at 
those who suffer from this serious malady.
Coming to Terms with What OCD Is
People with OCD have obsessions and/or compulsions. Well, duh! How’s that 
for stating the obvious? These obsessions and compulsions can vary in both 
intensity and content over time. Thus, someone may have a terrible problem 
with compulsive hand-washing for two hours every day. After a year or so 
passes, the hand-washing may fall off, but compulsive rituals involving exces-
sive cleaning of the house and arranging the furniture precisely emerge in its 
place.
 
OCD has been considered to be one of the anxiety disorders (which include 
generalized anxiety disorder, phobias, post-traumatic stress disorder, and 
panic disorder, among others) because people with OCD usually complain 
of feeling anxious, uneasy, or distressed. This feeling is often brought on by 
obsessive fears, thoughts, or images. See our earlier book, Overcoming Anxiety 
For Dummies, for more information about anxiety disorders. However, OCD 
involves more than anxiety. It also includes distorted thinking, and repetitious 
urges and impulses. Therefore, some professionals now believe that OCD 
should be categorized separately from the anxiety disorders.
The OCD anxiety cycle
In OCD, an obsessive thought, urge, or image occurs, sometimes out of the 
blue and other times triggered by an event, such as being near someone who 
sneezes. Once the obsessional worry about germs pops up in response to the 
sneeze, the person magnifies the risk or threat that the obsession poses. For 
example, the sneeze may be viewed as a spew of serious pathogens sprayed 
in the air. The OCD mind believes this threat is very serious and anxiety 
surges. The rising anxiety causes the person to feel desperate to reduce the 
distress. The OCD solution is to carry out a compulsion, such as spraying lots 
of antiviral gel in the nose to quell the anxiety. Completing the compulsion 
results in a short period of relief, which, in turn, actually increases the likeli-
hood that the compulsion will be used again. To illustrate this OCD anxiety 
cycle, we use the following example of Cyan.

23
 Chapter 2: Scrutinizing OCD
Cyan is a bookkeeper who worries excessively about getting AIDS from 
touching anything that other people may have touched. Thus, she avoids 
touching doorknobs, shaking hands, and using public restrooms. She 
works at home to avoid unnecessary contact with germs. She carries 
hand sanitizer and disinfectant in her purse. Even at home she disinfects 
her countertops and telephone dozens of times each day. She worries 
that germs float in the air and invade her home.
Whenever an obsessional worry about contamination pops into her 
mind, Cyan believes that she is at high risk for acquiring AIDS or some 
other serious illness. Her overestimation of risk leads Cyan to feel intense 
anxiety and overwhelming dread. That distress causes her to immedi-
ately wash her hands with sanitizer and disinfect her computer keyboard, 
kitchen countertops, and phones. Once she has done “enough” cleaning, 
she feels greatly relieved, but only for a short while. The power of that 
relief keeps the cycle going. Her obsessive thoughts soon return.
Cyan’s cycle is common in OCD and is depicted in Figure 2-1.

Cyan’s obsession about getting contaminated leads to anxiety. Her cleaning

back.

24
Part I: The Ins and Outs of OCD 
This cycle explains why OCD is typically considered to be a type of anxiety 
disorder. Obsessions are interpreted as serious dangers which lead to anxi-
ety and a compulsion to do something to reduce the risk in order to alleviate 
the anxiety. But OCD is actually more complicated and the symptoms often 
appear to involve more than feelings of anxiety. A couple other culprits need 
to be considered in the quest to understand OCD. People with OCD have 
problems with the way they think and with their ability to control impulses.
Thinking and believing
OCD is really a disorder of belief or thinking. People with OCD lack complete 
insight into the truth of their obsessions or compulsions. They may be able 
to admit that their obsessions or compulsions are unreasonable. But they 
don’t fully believe the obsessions or compulsions are completely irrational 
because their minds are full of doubt.
For example, a woman with OCD may believe that putting soup cans in a cer-
tain order on her shelves protects her children from getting sick — not an 
especially logical thought. If you ask the woman what evidence she has that 
her ritual protects her children, she doesn’t have much to tell you. But she 
has enough doubts that she feels compelled to continue with her compulsive 
ritual. After all, she wants to keep her kids safe.
Or a man with OCD may worry about the possibility of leaving the stove on. He 
may admit in a calm discussion that his beliefs are not completely consistent 
with reality. He’s never actually left the stove on, even though he’s checked 
hundreds of times. But he continues to act as if his beliefs about needing to 
check are true. He has just enough doubt to continue checking again and again.
Delusional thinking
OCD thinking sometimes goes to such extremes that it appears delusional or 
completely out of touch with reality. For example, some cases of OCD involve 
worries like becoming contaminated and infected by molecules emanating from 
things made out of stainless steel. Other sufferers may feel compelled to perform 
an elaborate ritual involving counting and precisely arranging items — firmly 
believing that if the ritual is not performed correctly, a loved one will die. When 
OCD thinking becomes this distorted, treatment and diagnosis can become more 
complex.
Extreme doubting
People without OCD also experience doubt. Consider the common superstition 
that knocking on wood after stating something positive will ward off bad things 
happening in the future. Is it really true that knocking on wood keeps someone 
safe? Where is the evidence? Have there been studies about not knocking on 
wood? Most people would agree that the superstition is sort of silly. Yet, many 
people continue to knock on wood. Why not, just in case, right?

25
 Chapter 2: Scrutinizing OCD
Those who continue to engage in wood knocking technically have a disorder 
of thinking and believing, but it’s hardly a serious one. At least we hope it 
isn’t serious, because we’ve been known to do it ourselves on occasion.
 
What makes wood knocking okay and not a compulsion are two characteristics 
that make OCD a disorder:
 
 The first characteristic of OCD is that when a compulsion is blocked, 
there is a great deal of distress. However, “wood knockers” don’t usu-
ally get too upset when they can’t find wood to knock on (besides, wood 
laminates will do in a pinch!).
 
 The second aspect of OCD that makes it different from wood knocking 
is that it interferes with life and takes huge amounts of time — most 
people don’t spend hours each day knocking on wood.
Inspecting impulses
Some people have described their OCD like a “brain itch” or a “brain hiccup.” 
In other words, OCD can feel impossible to suppress. An obsessive thought 
intrudes into the mind like a bolt of lightning. A compulsive action, such as 
arranging food alphabetically in the refrigerator, can feel as necessary as 
breathing. The impulse often involves an intense feeling or need for things to 
be just right.
For some people, this driven impulsivity seems to underlie their OCD more 
than anxiety or worry. That’s why some experts suggest that problems such 
as trichotillomania (uncontrollable hair-pulling) and tics (uncontrollable jerk-
ing, body movements, or sounds) are related to OCD. See Chapter 3 for more 
information about OCD’s relatives.
Seeing the Two Sides of OCD
Technically, OCD involves either obsessions or compulsions, or a combina-
tion of both. We say “technically” because in reality, almost everyone with 
OCD has both obsessions and compulsions. Distinguishing between obses-
sions and compulsions can seem a little tricky, but here goes.
The difference between an obsession and a compulsion is that obsessions are 
intrusive mental events that make a person feel terribly upset. Compulsions, 
on the other hand, are behaviors or actions someone engages in either men-
tally (like counting or repeating words) or physically (like washing hands) 
in order to feel better. In other words, obsessions start in the mind and then 
create a negative emotional response, while compulsions are actions (either 
mental or physical) targeted to soothe negative emotions.

26
Part I: The Ins and Outs of OCD 
The next two sections examine the nature of obsessions and compulsions in 
more detail.
Obsessing about obsessions
Obsessions are like uninvited houseguests who refuse to leave. They barge 
into your mind like mental terrorists. Obsessions make you feel uncomfortable, 
uneasy, angry, and sometimes frightened. Obsessions come in three forms:
 
 Thoughts: Thoughts are the words that clang around in your head. For 
example, if you touch something dirty, you may have the thought “I’m 
sure to get sick if I don’t do something immediately.” Other obsessional 
thoughts come in the form of doubting whether you’ve locked the doors 
or concerns about things not being arranged correctly.
 
 Urges: These are feelings, impulses, or worries that you’re going to do 
something inappropriate or undesirable. For example, you may have an 
urge to harm someone you care about or a need to have everything in a 
very specific, “just so” order. Other examples of obsessive urges include 
worries that you may shout out obscenities during a religious ceremony 
or that you may turn your car into oncoming traffic.
 
 Images: These are uninvited pictures that form in your mind, often 
depicting violent, horrifying, morally reprehensible, weird, and 
unwanted scenes. Disturbing images may include scenes involving sex 
with animals, child abuse, or gruesome murder.
Obsessive thoughts, urges, or images seem to pop into the mind without 
warning. When they do appear, they cause a lot of distress if you have OCD. 
Lonnie’s story illustrates how an obsession is experienced by someone who 
suffers from OCD.
Lonnie forces himself to attend his niece’s wedding. He’s not particularly 
close to his family and finds himself seated at a table with seven of his 
elderly aunts. The reception has barely started and he’s already anxious 
to get home.
The best man toasts the bride and groom and Lonnie’s mind wanders. 
Suddenly, he looks around at his tablemates and a picture of what they 
would look like naked pops into his mind. His mind envisions seven women, 
over 75, with sagging breasts, wrinkled faces, and much worse. Horrified, 
Lonnie gulps the sweetly spiced punch in front of him. “My God,” he thinks, 
“Why do I have thoughts like these all the time? I must be a sick pervert!”
Just as suddenly, his mind suggests a slow, sensual dance with his 
85-year-old aunt seated next to him. Then, a second later, comes an image 
of a steamy hotel room scene with his elderly aunt. We won’t give you the 
details of the rest of Lonnie’s imagery. Lonnie has a sudden urge to shout 
out, “Baby, you are so hot!”

27
 Chapter 2: Scrutinizing OCD
“Ick, what’s wrong with me? Am I losing my mind?” Lonnie blushes with 
embarrassment and almost jumps out of his skin when his aunt touches 
his arm and asks kindly, “Lonnie, are you okay? You look flushed — is 
there anything I can do for you?”
Lonnie experienced intrusive, unwanted thoughts, impulses, and images. 
These are obsessions. Lonnie’s rather strange incident is not an uncommon 
example of an obsession. His thoughts represent the essential characteris-
tics of obsessions (as opposed to normal, mildly worrisome thoughts and 
doubts). The thoughts Lonnie associates with his obsession are
 
 Disconnected: The obsessive thoughts, urges, or images jump into 
conscious awareness. They seem disconnected to what the person had 
been doing or thinking. These are not pleasant daydreams; people don’t 
willfully ask for obsessions.
 
 Unacceptable: The thoughts are unwanted and unacceptable to the person 
who has them. Obsessions involve actions or thoughts that are totally silly, 
uncharacteristic, morally upsetting, violent, or uncomfortable.
 
 Uncontrollable: The thoughts capture attention. Wow, do they! When an 
obsession comes along, it’s difficult to think about anything else. Thus, 
they interfere with whatever a person was trying to think about or get 
done. Obsessions overpower the mind and feel uncontrollable.
 
 Highly upsetting: Feelings after the obsessive thoughts, images, or 
urges are highly upsetting. Worry, guilt, fear, anger, disgust, or sadness 
often follow obsessions.
 
 Frequently reoccurring: An obsession tends to reoccur often. People 
who have obsessions work hard to suppress them. They may avoid 
situations that they associate with their thoughts or perform rituals to 
keep their thoughts at bay. Untreated, obsessional thoughts spread like 
unchecked weeds, choking out healthy, adaptive thinking and increasing 
the distress of their victims.
This final characteristic truly separates the “obsessions” (that is, mild worries) 
almost everyone occasionally experiences from obsessions experienced by 
people with OCD. For those who suffer from OCD, this piece of the obsession is 
what makes life miserable.
 
The informal use of the word “obsession” often conveys a positive, enthusias-
tic focus on something pleasant or desirable such as a passion for fishing, coin 
collecting, a new relationship, or art. The word “obsession” as used in OCD 
has nothing to do with such positive interests.

28
Part I: The Ins and Outs of OCD 
Considering compulsions
Compulsions are actions people feel driven to complete in order to deal 
with obsessions. These actions frequently take the form of behaviors, such 
as hand-washing or repeatedly checking locks, or rituals, such as lining up 
everything in a cupboard in an unusually precise manner. Unlike obsessions 
that merely heighten anxiety and distress, compulsions are intended to neu-
tralize obsessions or reduce distress. Compulsions can also come in the form 
of mental acts (such as counting or repeating phrases).
Compulsions are attempts to:
 
 Reduce anxiety: For example, after suffering from an obsessional worry that 
the doors are unlocked (thus inviting unwanted intruders) a person may 
feel compelled to return and recheck his door locks. Once he’s done so, he 
feels briefly relieved. But then he leaves his house again, and the obsession 
returns, thus compelling him to go back to check. This cycle may continue 
numerous times before he’s able to let go and continue with his day.
 
 Respond to an urge: After using the public restroom a person may 
obsess about possible germs, contamination, and sickness. She may feel 
an irresistible urge to scrub her hands. She carries a powerful disinfec-
tant and spends 30 minutes washing her hands, even though they’re red, 
raw, and oozing from all the washing she does.
When your ear has worms: Read this sidebar 
at your own risk!
If you have attended a wedding in the last ten 
years, you can probably conjure up the melody 
to “Y.M.C.A.” or, worse, “Macarena.” Can you 
recall the jingle that starts with “I love my baby 
back, baby back . . .” or how about the song 
on the ride at Disneyland with the lyrics, “It’s a 
small world. . . .” Have we ruined your day?
Scientists study and label everything. So, 
they’ve come up with a term for getting a song 
stuck in your mind. That term is “earworm.” 
Now, think about an earworm, a slimy parasite, 
digging into your brain. What does it look like? 
Imagine one crawling through your ear. Yuck!
When you consider these musical annoy-
ances, the earworm has many of the same 
characteristics of an obsession. Segments of 
songs, like obsessional images and thoughts, 
flood your mind over and over and feel both 
unwanted and obnoxious. The more you try to 
get rid of the melody, the more entrenched it 
becomes. Like obsessions, earworms occur 
more often in people who worry a lot.
So, how do you get rid of the nuisance? That’s 
the bad news. To date, no sure and successful 
earworm exterminators have been found. Some 
people try to substitute one song for another. 
Others get unstuck by passing the worm onto 
someone else. Here we go, we’ll try passing 
this one along that’s been bugging us since we 
started writing this sidebar . . . Y.M.C.A. . . .

29
 Chapter 2: Scrutinizing OCD
 
 Decrease discomfort: Some compulsions appear out of a need to feel 
more comfortable or “just so.” For example, a person may have a ritual 
she feels compelled to perform in order to go to bed. She arranges items 
on her nightstand over and over until they feel “just right.” In addition, 
she touches her shoulders five times each and repeats these touches 
until she feels comfortable. Only then can she allow herself to go to bed.
 
 Seek certainty: A person may have an obsession that he might run 
someone over in his car. Almost every time his car goes over a bump 
in the road he starts to worry. He often feels compelled to turn his car 
around to check. Even then sometimes he drives off and feels he must 
return to check again to be absolutely certain he did not injure some-
one. This compulsion consumes hours of his time each day.
 
 Obtain reassurance: A 10-year-old may worry obsessively that her par-
ents might not still love her. So every night, after she’s been put to bed, 
she gets up and goes to her parents’ bedroom and asks if they still love 
her. She feels compelled to repeat this ritual many times seeking this 
reassurance. Before she stops, her parents become upset and irritated. 
But they always give her the reassurance she asks for.
 
 Increase a sense of safety or well-being: Someone may have frequent 
obsessional worries that his thoughts might cause harm to his family. 
So, if he has the slightest negative image or thought about anyone in 
his family, he feels compelled to repeat the words “Hail Mary; I love my 
family so much,” 50 times in his mind. Sometimes he loses count and has 
to start over.
Categorizing the Types of OCD
Unlike depression and some other disorders, OCD is variegated. People 
who suffer from depression look a lot alike. Although their symptoms differ 
somewhat, most depressed folks feel sad and gloomy, have low energy, and 
lack enthusiasm. By contrast, OCD looks more like breeds of dogs that differ 
in appearance the way that dachshunds, Great Danes, cocker spaniels, Saint 
Bernards, and Yorkshire terriers do. In other words, OCD shows up in very 
different forms from person to person.
Experts have struggled to come to an agreement on the various breeds of 
OCD and have so far failed to reach a consensus. Thus, a certain amount of 
uncertainty remains about how to categorize OCD. Unfortunately, people 
with OCD typically crave certainty.
Therefore, we’ve combed through the literature and distilled a pretty com-
prehensive list of OCD subtypes. Although not every expert would fully agree 
that our list is definitive, we think you’re likely to find the most common 
types of OCD listed and even a few that are rather rare:

30
Part I: The Ins and Outs of OCD 
 
 Checking and doubting
 
 Fearing contamination
 
 Hoarding
 
 Having inappropriate thoughts — religious, sexual, and aggressive
 
 Heeding superstitions
 
 Needing symmetry
 
Each subtype of OCD can occur by itself or in concert with other categories of 
obsessions and compulsions. It is not unusual to have a mix of symptoms or 
for OCD to morph and change over time. Having a mix of symptoms can make 
treatment a little more challenging, but certainly not impossible.
Doubts, fears, and uncertainties
Doubt and uncertainty plague the minds of those with the “checking” form of 
OCD. Some experts even call OCD a “disease of doubt.” When doubts show 
up, the person goes back to check over and over again. A slight amount of 
uncertainty always remains even after checking, so the person does it yet 
again. Sometimes it takes an awful lot of rechecking before the person is able 
to stop. Doubts involve the following types of concerns:
 
 Forgetting to do important tasks like:
 
• Closing doors, windows, and blinds correctly
 
• Turning appliances off
 
• Locking doors
 
• Turning the water off
 
 Fear of making mistakes, such as:
 
• Forgetting appointments
 
• Turning in imperfect school or work assignments
 
• Balancing your checkbook incorrectly
 
 Needing reassurance that:
 
• Loved ones are safe
 
• Loved ones still care
 
• Your appearance is okay
 
• Your home is safe

31
 Chapter 2: Scrutinizing OCD
Each time people with this problem check on a concern, they feel momentary 
relief. That relief is short-lived as uncertainty begins to creep in again. Some 
people with obsessions and compulsions regarding checking spend hours 
each day worrying and futilely checking and rechecking. See Chapter 13 for 
more information about this form of OCD and its treatment.
Contamination, germs, and dirt
Obsessions about contamination, germs, and dirt plague more sufferers with 
OCD than any other issue. Some worry about getting ill from dirt or germs; 
others believe they may become contaminated and sickened by chemicals, 
radiation, asbestos, insects, sticky substances, animals, bodily waste or 
secretions, or pesticides.
The OCD mind greatly exaggerates real risks. Although it’s possible to catch a 
cold from shaking someone’s hand, people with OCD worry excessively each 
time they shake hands with someone. These fears lead to immediate, vigor-
ous hand-washing in order to avoid coming down with a serious, dreaded 
cold or something even worse. The exaggerated fears about germs and 
contamination often lead to one or more of the following:
 
 Avoiding items that have touched other items imagined to be 
contaminated
 
 Avoiding people or places thought to be contaminated
 
 Avoiding public restrooms
 
 Hours of daily cleaning with harsh disinfectants and chemicals
 
 Hours of hand-washing every day causing raw, bleeding skin
 
 An inability to eat outside of the home
 
 Throwing away clothes imagined to be contaminated
 
 Washing dishes in a particular order and manner — a ritual which must 
be repeated if not done “properly.”
 
 Wearing face masks in public
Because contamination issues represent the most common type of OCD, 
we provide more details and focus on its treatment in Chapters 8, 9, and 10. 
Those chapters also feature more variations and extreme manifestations of 
this particular type of OCD. The other categories of OCD that follow are 
covered in more depth in their own short chapters in Part III.

Part I: The Ins and Outs of OCD 
Collecting and hoarding
Children begin “hoarding” hobbies at young ages. Kids like to collect coins, 
bottle caps, and pine cones. Collections are a normal developmental process — 
unless the collecting goes awry and spirals out of control. Hoarders start with 
a normal amount of stuff, but evolve into perpetual, driven squirrels. They find 
themselves collecting a wider and wider variety of things. Eventually, some 
hoarders discover that they can’t throw out much of anything.
 
Over the years, hoarding can lead to isolation from others, sanitation prob-
lems, fire hazards, and serious health consequences. The homes of hoarders 
often become choked with “stuff” from ceiling to floor. This fascinating 
phenomena is covered in Chapter 16, along with treatment strategies.
 
A number of researchers now believe that Hoarding OCD is a slightly different 
category of problem than the other types of OCD. We explain this issue in detail 
in Chapter 16.
Shame, embarrassment, and inappropriate 
thoughts and behaviors
This type of OCD involves a host of concerns about the possibility of doing 
something humiliating or grossly inappropriate. As with most categories of 
OCD, the specifics of these concerns can vary greatly from one person to the 
next. Following, you find a multitude of flavors.
Religious obsessions and compulsions (Scrupulosity)
Scrupulosity describes someone’s over-concern with sin and morality as well 
as fears about offending God. The word scrupulosity comes from the Latin 
word “scrupulus” and means sharp stone — suggesting the feeling of stab-
bing pain that results from acts against the conscience. People with this type 
of OCD have extreme concerns about not pleasing God or dread that they 
will be dammed and rejected. They often spend hours praying or performing 
complicated rituals.
Religious obsessions can come in the form of blasphemous thoughts. Some 
people with OCD worry that they might shout out swear words during a reli-
gious ceremony. Others have repeated sexual images of contemporary spiri-
tual leaders or even historical religious figures. Some have repeated phrases, 
such as “god damn,” popping into their thoughts throughout the day. These 
obsessions are accompanied by feelings of profound dread and shame. The 
person tries to neutralize or undo the feelings of intense guilt by resorting to 
compulsive prayers or rituals.

33
 Chapter 2: Scrutinizing OCD
The compulsions that follow religious obsessions don’t always make logical 
sense. The example of Cade below illustrates how illogical these compulsive 
rituals can be.
Cade finds himself obsessing about displeasing God. He constantly worries 
when profane words come into his mind because he believes that having 
such thoughts greatly offends God. In order to deal with his distress, he has 
developed a compulsion designed to undo the obsession.
His compulsion involves walking a few blocks to his church, day or night. 
Then he climbs the stairs and stands by the door. He counts to 45, and 
then says 45 prayers. If he is interrupted or distracted, he must start the 
routine over until it feels just right. Cade’s compulsion may seem strange 
and silly to others, but Cade believes that he must do this in order to 
show God that he is worthy. When he’s finished, he feels better for a 
while, but the obsessions and compulsions always return.
As you can see, Cade’s counting and praying compulsions don’t make a great 
deal of sense. Nonetheless, he believes that they somehow rectify his standing 
with God.
Sexual and aggressive obsessions and compulsions
People with these types of OCD dwell on the possibility, no matter how 
slight, that they might harm others or engage in sexual acts that they feel 
would be abhorrent and repugnant. See Chapter 14 for more information 
about sexual and aggressive forms of OCD, as well as treatment strategies for 
dealing with them. There, you will also see that those with this type of OCD 
almost never do the things they gravely fear they’ll do.
A fairly common variant of sexual obsessions has to do with believing that one 
is gay. Often these folks are not especially “homophobic” and they don’t have 
particular biases against people who are gay. But they are repelled by the idea 
that they might actually be gay. Another sexual obsession concerns worry that 
one might be a pedophiliac (someone who sexually abuses children).
Other people with OCD become concerned that they will harm or hurt someone. 
Here are a couple of common obsessions and compulsions with this theme:
 
 While walking on a busy sidewalk, a man worries that he may push 
someone next to him into oncoming traffic. He is abhorred by this image 
and tries to block it by repeating “God, save me” 17 times in his head.
 
 A young mother has intrusive thoughts and images (in other words, 
obsessions) of harming her baby daughter in some horrific way. Her 
beliefs cause her to put away all the knives on the counter, and she feels 
unable to bathe her baby for fear that she will drown her.

34
Part I: The Ins and Outs of OCD 
 
Sometimes OCD in one category can easily overlap with OCD themes from 
another category. Thus, those with sexual and aggressive OCD obsessions and 
compulsions commonly have concerns about the religiously inappropriate 
nature of their thoughts.
Superstitions and rituals
Superstitions involve beliefs that various events, circumstances, and hap-
penings have extraordinary significance with ominous implications. The 
ultimate concern of most superstitions involves fear of death. Thus, one with 
Superstitious OCD may attach great meaning to the power of:
 
 Numbers: Those with Superstitious OCD may feel they must do every-
thing in sets of five or some other special number or something hor-
rific will occur. Hotels typically skip the 13th floor because so many 
people feel it’s unlucky. However, folks with that concern only have 
Superstitious OCD if they spend lots of time worrying excessively about 
certain numbers.
 
 Anything related to death: Here, special significance is attached to 
having passed a hearse, cemetery, or funeral home. Sometimes these 
obsessions and compulsions have only a superficial, subtle connection 
to death. For example, a woman with this type of OCD may avoid sitting 
in a chair previously owned by a now-dead person.
 
 Words: Sometimes the superstitions concern the special power and 
meaning of specific words. For example, a man with this type of OCD 
may feel compelled to say “Bingo!” whenever he ends a sentence 
because he fears that someone will die if he doesn’t.
Again, these categories of OCD are somewhat arbitrary. Superstitions 
permeate many of the earlier categories of OCD.
Symmetry and perfectionism
A driven need for symmetry, slowness, and precision are common themes in 
an OCD category we’ve chosen to call the “just so” or the “just right” type of 
OCD. As with most OCD categories, “Just So” OCD frequently accompanies 
other types of OCD. Some examples include:
 
 Feeling compelled to order books alphabetically by the second word in 
the title and align them exactly one-half inch from the bookshelf’s edge
 
 Spending hours each day making sure the fringe on floor rugs is lined up 
perfectly
 
 A teenager rewriting class notes in perfect calligraphy each day

35
 Chapter 2: Scrutinizing OCD
Joey is a 10-year-old child who worries about his parents’ safety. His story 
illustrates OCD with a checking component along with a need for his rituals 
to be “just so.”
Joey gets up several times each night to check on his parents. He also 
believes that he must follow a special bedtime routine involving reading 
a special story, putting his pajamas on in a certain way, smoothing out 
his bed perfectly, placing his pillow diagonally from the left bedpost, 
and demanding that both of his parents say “I love you” three times. 
Otherwise, he believes that his parents will die during the night. He 
spends hours on these routines until he gets a feeling that he’s done 
everything “just right.”
Joey’s story demonstrates how “Just So” OCD has no real logic to it. People 
with this form of OCD believe that the feeling of “just so” has some kind of 
special importance and significance. See Chapter 15 for more information, 
illustrations, and treatment strategies for this type of OCD.
Separating OCD from Normal Worries
Are you obsessively wondering whether you have OCD? Table 2-1 is a simple 
little quiz that can help you gain some insight on the matter. Check the 
appropriate “Yes” or “No” box next to each question (each question is 
representative of a symptom of OCD).
Table 2-1 
Could You Have OCD?
Yes
No
Have you . . . 
Counted the stairs as you walk up them?
Carried a lucky charm?
Knocked on wood?
Had a horrible image of hurting someone you care about?
Felt a need to clean your house more than usual?
Gone back to recheck the locks in your house?
Had a bad feeling you may have left the coffeepot on?
Wondered whether you might be gay?
Avoided stepping on cracks?
Worried that your house might burn down?
Struggled to throw out things you don’t need?
Had an inappropriate, unwanted sexual image in your mind?
(continued)

36
Part I: The Ins and Outs of OCD 
Table 2-1 (continued)
Yes
No
Have you . . . 
Worried that you may have committed a sin?
Worried that you may have offended someone?
Had a minor physical symptom that your mind blew up into a seri-
ous illness?
Felt dirty for no good reason and had a strong urge to wash your 
hands?
Did you check “yes” to two or more items in Table 2-1? You did? Good! That 
means you answered honestly. But no matter how many items you checked 
yes or no, this quiz doesn’t say much at all about whether you suffer from OCD.
Studies tell us that almost everyone has occasional unwanted thoughts 
(obsessions) or engages in a few actions designed to reduce tension or dis-
tress (compulsions) just like the ones in Table 2-1. Yet the “symptoms” in 
Table 2-1 look pretty much like the obsessions and compulsions that make 
up OCD. The operative words are occasional and few.
Over 90 percent of people report occasionally experiencing some of the exact 
same kinds of obsessive thoughts, urges, and images that someone with OCD 
may have (and we wonder if the other 10 percent are telling the truth!). For 
example, most people have occasionally imagined physically hurting someone 
in a terrible way. Maybe you’ve walked by the knife holder and had a brief dis-
turbing image of pulling one out and stabbing your child. You are not alone! 
Occasional imaginings like this are neither rare, nor an indication you have OCD.
 
Someone with OCD, on the other hand, frequently experiences unsettling 
images, truly worries about acting out those images, and feels enormously 
upset by them.
Getting to a Diagnosis of OCD
To be officially diagnosed as having OCD, three factors must be present:
 
 The person must frequently experience either obsessions, compulsions, 
or both.
 
 Except for children, at one time or another the person must at least 
partially recognize that the symptoms are illogical or unreasonable.
 
 Dealing with the symptoms must take up lots of time and interfere with 
life in a significant way.

37
 Chapter 2: Scrutinizing OCD
Insight or awareness of the “unreasonable” nature of OCD varies widely from 
person to person. If you talk with most adults who suffer from OCD, usually 
they know at some level that their obsessions and compulsions don’t make a 
whole lot of sense. For example, people who fear becoming contaminated by 
touching telephones probably know that their fear is overblown. But ask a man 
with this fear to touch a telephone and you’ll encounter surprising resistance 
and emotional upset at the very thought.
Children sometimes have almost no insight or awareness that their OCD is 
irrational. They sometimes think that their rituals or obsessive thoughts are 
quite plausible and necessary. For example, a child may truly believe that she 
must repeat “Thank you God for my family” 20 times in order to keep every-
one safe — and if she doesn’t say it just right, she must keep repeating the 
phrase or someone in her family will die.
Sometimes people with OCD even worry that they’re losing their minds. OCD 
takes over so much of their lives that they feel totally helpless and incapaci-
tated. At its worst, OCD can take many hours of a person’s time every single 
day. OCD interferes with jobs, relationships, school, achievements, and 
everyday household chores.
 
Although OCD can be quite serious, the problem is definitely treatable. If you 
or someone you care about has OCD-like symptoms, seek help. See Chapter 7 
for more on finding appropriate treatment for OCD.
 
OCD takes away joy, productivity, time, and relationships while giving back 
anxiety, doubt, uncertainty and misery. If you spend an hour each day wor-
rying about and trying to solve your financial problems while teetering on 
the edge of bankruptcy, that’s not OCD. That’s realistic concern. But if you’re 
sitting on a six-million-dollar stash of cash and worrying for hours each day 
whether you’ll have enough to retire, you just may be showing signs of OCD.
Avoiding self-diagnosis
 
Please do not attempt to diagnose OCD in yourself or others. We give you 
general guidelines so that you can know enough to get any such concerns 
checked out by a professional. OCD is complex and should be evaluated 
by a professional who is experienced with this disorder. See Chapter 7 
for information on finding qualified professionals who can diagnose and 
help you.

38
Part I: The Ins and Outs of OCD 
Avoiding misdiagnosis
OCD is often missed or misdiagnosed by doctors and counselors. Quite a 
few people go from professional to professional before receiving a correct 
evaluation. According to the Obsessive Compulsive Foundation, people with 
OCD take up to 9 years to obtain an accurate diagnosis and an average of 17 
years to receive appropriate treatment. One of the reasons it can take so long 
is that many of those with OCD keep their symptoms secret, especially the 
more bizarre symptoms. So be open with your mental-health professional 
and be sure you go to someone well-qualified in diagnosing OCD.

Meeting the Relatives and 
Associates of OCD
In This Chapter

O
bsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) has many relatives and lots of 
associates. Relatives are disorders that look very much like OCD, 
but are not necessarily OCD. These related disorders all involve difficult-
to-repress, repetitive urges, thoughts, images, impulses, and/or behaviors. 
These impulses are very difficult to control, even though people find them 
quite disturbing and disruptive to their lives.
Associates of OCD are disorders or emotional problems that often accompany 
OCD, but are not thought to be directly related to the disorder. They don’t always 
show up, but OCD sufferers are usually at greater risk of succumbing to them.
In this chapter, we briefly describe the relatives of OCD, and what their rela-
tionships to OCD are like. Some of these relatives are almost indistinguish-
able from OCD and there’s some controversy as to whether there should be a 
distinction. We also tell you about the associates of OCD so you’ll recognize 
them if they come knocking.

Part I: The Ins and Outs of OCD 
Meeting the Relatives of OCD
A rainbow contains a spectrum of colors. Although each color is distinct, the 
colors are all formed by reflected sunlight within the same rainbow. Okay, we 
know we’re mixing metaphors now, but our point is that scientists continue 
to engage in robust arguments about whether or not OCD can be thought of 
as a spectrum of closely related disorders sharing certain common features 
as opposed to a single distinct disorder. And recent studies on the neurobiol-
ogy of OCD-related disorders suggest that they have some common genetic 
and biological roots (see Chapter 4 for more information about the biological 
aspects of OCD and its relatives).
 
In OCD, compulsions are primarily driven by the need to decrease a feeling of 
dread or distress. In other words, compulsions are actions that decrease anx-
iety or avoid risk (see Chapter 2 for more information about compulsions). 
By contrast, some of the related disorders involve repetitive urges or impul-
sions driven by a need to maximize stimulation or pleasure. Impulsions are 
stimulating and done with little thought about safety or risk. Both impulsions 
and compulsions are repetitive and difficult to control or inhibit.
The following sections describe most of these related disorders and what 
makes them like and unlike OCD. We include a table at the end of each sec-
tion that summarizes these similarities and differences. See Chapter 19 for 
an overview of ideas about how to deal with these relatives of OCD. And see 
Appendix A for additional information and resources.
Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD): 
A seriously distorted self-image
Probably everyone has at least one thing they don’t like about their appear-
ance or body, but it’s ultimately no big deal. On the other hand, people with 
body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) believe something is horribly wrong with 
their appearance or bodies. They obsess about minor flaws in their appear-
ance and engage in compulsive actions to reduce the discomfort they feel. 
BDD often occurs in people with a diagnosis of OCD and shares many of the 
same features. Common obsessive thoughts associated with BDD include 
worries about having:
 
 A complexion with mild discoloration
 
 A crooked nose
 
 A head that’s too big or too small for the body
 
 A small facial scar
 
 A thin mouth

41
 Chapter 3: Meeting the Relatives and Associates of OCD
 
 A weak jaw
 
 Bumps on the face
 
 Eyes that are too small
 
 Hair that’s too curly or too thin, or too much hair
 
 Mild acne
 
 Protruding ears
 
 Wrinkles
Other concerns involve the size of the sex organs or other body parts. The list 
is endless. The defects that concern people with BDD are greatly exaggerated 
and rarely (if ever) noticed by others.
The concerns of those with BDD may change from one aspect of the suf-
ferer’s appearance to another. Symptoms may ease up for awhile and then 
get worse.
BDD involves much more than normal preoccupation about one’s looks. 
People with BDD feel that they are deformed, ugly, and defective. In order to 
feel better, BDD sufferers engage in compulsive behaviors, such as:
 
 Asking for frequent reassurance from others
 
 Becoming housebound because of embarrassment
 
 Checking themselves constantly in the mirror
 
 Digging or picking at imagined deformities (causing infections, skin 
irritations, and scars)
 
 Washing or shaving excessively
 
 Visiting dermatologists frequently
 
 Having extensive cosmetic surgery
 
 Keeping the head down or combing hair across the face
 
 Wearing excessive make-up to hide the perceived flaw
 
 Wearing hats or clothes to camouflage the imagined defects
One could make the argument that BDD is actually a specific type of OCD, 
one that has an exclusive focus on the issue of appearance. On the other 
hand, BDD is a little different from the usual OCD in that behaviors like get-
ting plastic surgery or wearing a wig don’t occur repeatedly throughout each 
day like compulsions associated with most OCD (see Chapter 2 for more 
information about OCD and compulsions). Table 3-1 summarizes how BDD is 
like and unlike OCD.

42
Part I: The Ins and Outs of OCD 
 
BDD can result in severely disabling depression, isolation, and even suicide. If 
you or someone you know has symptoms of BDD, have an evaluation by a 
professional experienced with this disorder and get help.

Hypochondriasis: “I think I’m really sick”
People with hypochondriasis have deep fears and are preoccupied with the 
idea that they suffer from a serious illness. These fears are usually based on 
misinterpretations of vague bodily sensations, and they persist even after med-
ical evaluations confirm that nothing is wrong. Often those who suffer from this 
disorder have had multiple medical tests, made frequent trips to the doctor’s 
office, and repeatedly changed medical professionals. Hypochondriasis 
significantly interferes with vocational and interpersonal functioning.
 
Vague physical symptoms can be signs of real, treatable illnesses. If you or some-
one you care about experiences pain or new, undiagnosed symptoms, see your 
primary care doctor or other medical expert for an evaluation. If you receive a 
diagnosis of hypochondriasis, it will be important for your mental-health provider 
and your healthcare provider to communicate closely with one another.
What makes hypochondriasis similar to OCD? First, the over-concern and 
attention to physical complaints are obsessional. These worries are in the 
mind of the sufferer. People with hypochondriasis ask for repeated reassur-
ance from caregivers and family. Second, they engage in repetitive checking 
for bodily symptoms, like unusual coloration or consistency of their stool 
and minor aches and pains. Normal results of lab tests are typically doubted 
and they ask for tests to be repeated. Table 3-2 shows how hypochondriasis 
is similar to OCD, as well as how it differs.
 
It is, of course, possible that someone exhibiting symptoms of hypochondriasis 
suffers from a real, undiagnosed illness and that a doctor will eventually discover 
the problem. However, people with hypochondriasis and OCD of other types 
function better if they can learn to live with a certain degree of uncertainty.

Trichotillomania: Pulling your hair out
Trichotillomania is repetitively pulling hair out of one’s body and sometimes 
eating the hair. The hair can be pulled from anywhere on the body — the 
scalp, the eyebrows, other parts of the face, the underarms, the stomach, or 
even the pubic area. Hair-pulling can occur sporadically and briefly through-
out the day, or it can go on for hours. In order to have this diagnosis, a 
person must exhibit noticeable hair loss.
Besides hair loss, other effects of trichotillomania can include skin infections, 
social isolation, tendonitis, muscle strains (from repetitive movements of the 
wrist, head, or neck), and even gastrointestinal problems from ingesting hair. 
Some hair-pullers stroke pulled hairs, inspect them, or slide them between their 
teeth (causing wear of tooth enamel). People who have this disorder often go to 
great lengths to disguise their problem by combing over, using cosmetics, 
wearing wigs, or pulling hair from areas usually covered by clothing.
Some people with trichotillomania report feeling pleasure when they pull 
hair. Others report feeling an overwhelming urge to pull out hair, followed 
by a reduction of the urge and tension after they have pulled their hair for a 
while. While anxiety can increase hair-pulling, anxiety seems to play a less 
important role in trichotillomania than it does in OCD.
Like OCD, impulses or urges are repetitive. Rituals or compulsions can be 
involved with the hair-pulling. Hairs are sometimes chosen because they feel 
just right, are a particular color, or are in a certain location. After hairs are 
pulled, they can be eaten, placed or preserved in ritualistic ways, or brushed 
against the face.
Table 3-3 lists some ways in which trichotillomania resembles OCD and 
other ways in which it differs from OCD. See Chapter 19 for a brief overview 
of treatment strategies for trichotillomania and Appendix A for additional 
resources for this problem.

Tics and Tourette’s syndrome: Involuntary 
sounds and movements
Everyone demonstrates a few behaviors from time to time that can look a lot 
like tics. For example, who hasn’t drummed fingers, tapped a pencil, or expe-
rienced a sudden body jerk? However, those behaviors don’t quite qualify as 
tics. That’s because tic disorder involves movements or sounds that occur 
against a person’s will, suddenly, repeatedly, and irresistibly. Tourette’s 
syndrome includes multiple movements with sounds.
 
If you or someone you care about has signs of tics or Tourette’s syndrome, 
obtaining a complete neurological examination is important. Other types of 
neurological conditions can mimic tics and/or Tourette’s syndrome. Such con-
ditions include Sydenham’s chorea, which is related to rheumatic fever; autism, 
which is a complex developmental disorder; and pediatric autoimmune neu-
ropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections (also known as 
PANDAS). These other conditions may require different treatment approaches.
Obsessive-compulsive dogs
Studies suggest that OCD may exist in the animal 
kingdom as well as in humans. Acral canine lick 
is a skin disorder in dogs that involves repeti-
tive licking, scratching, or grooming. Dogs who 
are bored, left alone, or suffer from separa-
tion anxiety begin excessively licking an area, 
resulting in irritation and hair loss. This behav-
ior may temporarily reduce tension but usually 
results in discomfort, infection, and sometimes 
nerve damage. The similarity to OCD and other 
impulse control disorders is that the behavior 
is repetitive, impulsive, and probably originally 
intended by the dog to decrease anxiety or 
distress. That’s why many veterinarians con-
sider Acral canine lick to be the OCD of dogs. 
Interestingly, the same class of antidepressant 
medication that has been found to be helpful in 
treating OCD and trichotillomania has helped 
dogs with this disorder. But, please, don’t 
ever give any of your medication to your pets. 
Take them to the vet to get their own dosage 
prescribed.

45
 Chapter 3: Meeting the Relatives and Associates of OCD
Tic disorders
Simply put, tics are rapid, repetitive movements or vocalizations that a 
person can only temporarily suppress. Tics usually get worse when someone 
is under stress and improve when the person is completely absorbed by an 
activity (such as video games, playing the piano, giving a lecture, or even 
performing surgery). Tics usually abate during sleep. Common motor tics 
(involving body movements) include:
 
 Blinking
 
 Facial gestures
 
 Facial grimacing
 
 Grooming
 
 Hand gestures
 
 Jumping
 
 Shoulder-shrugging
 
 Sniffing
 
 Stamping
 
 Touching something
Common vocal tics (involving noise) include:
 
 Barking
 
 Clicks with the tongue or teeth
 
 Grunting
 
 Making screeching sounds
 
 Repeating words
 
 Snorting
 
 Throat-clearing
Tics show up in young children as early as the age of two. Often the sounds 
or gestures can be rather subtle and almost unnoticeable. Other times, they 
can appear dramatic and disruptive to others. Tic symptoms usually worsen 
between the ages of nine and fifteen. Over time, symptoms wax, wane, and 
shift from one type of tic to another.
Tourette’s syndrome
The diagnosis of Tourette’s syndrome (TS) is given when a person exhibits mul-
tiple motor tics along with at least one vocal tic. This distinction between tics 
and TS seems somewhat arbitrary. For example, someone with many motor tics 
would not receive the diagnosis of Tourette’s syndrome, but someone else with 
two motor tics and one mild vocal tic would be deemed as suffering from TS.

46
Part I: The Ins and Outs of OCD 
 
Good news. No one knows why for sure, but many people with either tic disor-
ders or TS discover that their symptoms significantly improve over the years. 
And even if the symptoms don’t improve, there are treatments that can help 
(see Chapter 19 for information about treating tic disorders and TS).
So how are tic disorders and TS like OCD? Tics feel irrepressible and uncon-
trollable just like compulsions feel for most people with OCD. And after a 
tic has been carried out, sometimes people report feeling slightly better for 
a while. Compulsions in OCD have an explicit intent to reduce anxiety or 
distress. By contrast, no clear goals are associated with tics and they seem 
automatic and reflexive. Table 3-4 points out the similarities and differences 
between OCD and tics and TS.
Although tics, TS, and OCD appear to be a little different from each other, it is 
common to suffer from both tics and OCD at the same time. Scientists 
theorize that tics, TS, and OCD have genetic links.

Skin-picking and nail-biting
Almost everyone occasionally picks at the skin on their hands or face to a 
limited degree at one time or another. This behavior is especially common 
when a scab forms, a rough patch of skin appears, or some other minor 
anomaly emerges on the scalp, nails, or skin. However, for some people, nail-
biting and skin-picking evolve into a serious disorder that causes scarring, 
bleeding, sores, infections, and considerable tissue destruction.
Skin-picking and nail-biting are surprisingly common. Although precise statis-
tics are not available, some researchers have reported as many as 5 percent 
of a sample of college students picked at their skin for over an hour per day. 
Those with this problem report great shame and worry about reactions from 
other people.

47
 Chapter 3: Meeting the Relatives and Associates of OCD
Typically, skin-picking and nail-biting seem to be driven by strong urges 
and a sense of temporary relief once the act is completed. Anxiety may not 
play quite as large of a role with skin-picking as it usually does with OCD, 
but skin-picking shares the repetitive, difficult-to-control aspects of OCD. 
Furthermore, those who skin-pick have higher than average rates of OCD.
 
Skin-picking and nail-biting sometimes occur because a person has body 
dysmorphic disorder (see the section on BDD earlier in this chapter). Thus, a 
woman with BDD may perceive a slight imperfection on her face and pick at the 
area in an attempt to remove the imperfection. Unfortunately, the skin-picking 
and nail-biting associated with BDD usually start with an attempt to improve 
appearance and end up making things worse — sometimes much worse.
Table 3-5 notes how skin-picking and nail-biting resemble OCD and how they 
differ from it. See Chapter 19 for a brief overview of treatment ideas for skin-
picking and nail-biting and Appendix A for additional resources for this problem.
When Tourette’s syndrome is misunderstood
Tourette’s syndrome is often confused or mis-
categorized by the public and media who are 
familiar with one of Tourette’s more noticeable 
sub-types, coprolalia. Those with the misfor-
tune of having this type of verbal tic find them-
selves uncontrollably shouting out obscenities. 
Sometimes teachers, coaches, and friends think 
that this symptom is under the sufferers’ control 
and incorrectly blame them for their seemingly 
inappropriate behavior.
Interestingly, some people with OCD (see 
Chapters 2 and 14 for information about inap-
propriate thoughts and OCD) greatly fear 
that they will shout out obscenities in public. 
However, they almost never actually do what 
they fear. Those with coprolalia unfortunately do 
experience uncontrolled shouting and swearing.
Fortunately, most people with Tourette’s syn-
drome do not experience the symptom of 
coprolalia. Estimates vary, but experts con-
tend that only about 10 to 15 percent of those 
with Tourette’s syndrome have coprolalia. 
Furthermore, many of those with tic disorder 
or TS have fairly mild tics that often go undi-
agnosed for many years. Getting a diagnosis 
can be useful because then treatment can be 
sought for the disorder (and tics and TS are 
treatable). However, some people’s symptoms 
are sufficiently mild that they do not greatly 
interfere with their lives and treatment may 
seem unnecessary. See Chapter 19 for a brief 
overview of treatment for these problems and 
Appendix A for more resources.

Eating disorders: Intense fear of fat
Most eating disorders share the issue of obsessive concern with appearance 
found in those with body dysmorphic disorder (BDD; see earlier section). In 
addition, research has shown that roughly 20 to 30 percent of those who have 
eating disorders also have OCD. Table 3-6 points out the main similarities and 
differences between OCD and eating disorders.
Eating disorders occur in various forms, but share an obsessional concern about 
weight. Sufferers intensely fear gaining weight and frequently have a distorted 
view of their body and shape. People with eating disorders sometimes:
 
 Exercise to excess in order to lose weight
 
 Have highly restricted diets
 
 Overuse laxatives as a weight-loss strategy
 
 Self-induce vomiting to purge their bodies of calories consumed
 
 Use diuretics and enemas to lose weight
 
Eating disorders can result in brain damage, loss of tooth enamel, erosion 
of the esophagus, malnutrition, abnormal heart rhythms, hormonal imbal-
ances, and even death. If you or someone you care about exhibits any of the 
symptoms of an eating disorder, please see a specialist in eating disorders to 
receive an appropriate diagnosis and treatment plan. You may also want to

Impulse control disorders: 
Unstoppable bad habits
Impulse control disorders share the concept of repetitive urges found in 
OCD. However, with impulse control disorders, the urges are not as clearly 
about needing to reduce distress or anxiety. Rather, the impulses seem more 
related to increasing a sense of pleasure or excitement. Table 3-7 notes some 
of the ways in which impulse control disorders resemble and differ from 
OCD. Impulse control disorders include
 
 Kleptomania: Kleptomaniacs can’t resist the impulse to steal things that 
they don’t even really need. They feel tense before stealing and experience 
pleasure and excitement following the act.
 
 Compulsive buying: Compulsive shoppers have problems similar to klep-
tomaniacs in the sense that they can’t resist things they don’t need. But 
in this case, they at least pay for the items. Their compulsive shopping 
frequently leads to serious financial problems.
 
 Gambling: Those with this problem often get themselves into serious 
trouble with finances, relationships, and even illegal behavior. They 
have recurrent, obsessive thoughts about gambling. Logically, they 
have some insight into the futility of their pursuits, but they cannot stop 
themselves from going after the next big win.
 
 Paraphilias: People with paraphilias are drawn to sexually arousing fanta-
sies and various sexual activities that are typically considered unacceptable 
or deviant (see the sidebar “Sexual obsession versus acting out”).
 
 Pyromania: People with pyromania are fascinated and obsessed by 
fires. They feel tension prior to setting fires and excitement following the 
act. They do not set fires for financial gain or revenge. Nonetheless, their 
behavior often lands them in jail.

Recognizing Associates of OCD
OCD associates are the emotional problems that often occur along with OCD 
but are not considered part of the OCD spectrum. Thus, they do not involve 
the same repetitive, irresistible obsessions and compulsions found in OCD. 
Those with OCD are at higher risk of having these emotional disturbances 
than those without OCD. In fact, OCD commonly is accompanied by one 
or more of these or other emotional disorders. We discuss the five most 
common types of emotional disorders that crop up alongside OCD.
Sexual obsession versus acting out
Paraphilias are quite different from sexual 
obsessions experienced by some who have 
OCD (see Chapter 2). Sexual obsessions asso-
ciated with OCD are deemed to be highly inap-
propriate by the person who experiences them. 
Those with OCD sexual obsessions obsess 
about whether they might have a paraphilia, 
but they actually do not. Thus, those with OCD 
sexual obsessions almost never act out their 
obsessions.
On the other hand, those with paraphilias derive 
considerable pleasure from their fantasies and 
often act them out. Just a few paraphiliac fan-
tasies and activities include:
  Exhibitionism: Exposing one’s genitals to 
strangers
  Fetishism: Using various non-living objects, 
such as underwear or shoes, to stimulate 
masturbation
  Frotteurism: Touching or rubbing against a 
non-consenting person
  Pedophilia: Sexual activity with underage 
children

51
 Chapter 3: Meeting the Relatives and Associates of OCD
Mood disorders
Studies suggest that at least a quarter of people diagnosed with OCD also 
have a disturbance of mood. Mood disorders come in two major types: 
depression and mania.
 
 Depression: Depression involves intense, prolonged feelings of sadness 
and low mood. Symptoms can include a lack of interest in things, insom-
nia, poor or excessive appetite, feelings of worthlessness, problems 
concentrating, and fatigue.
 
 Mania: Mania involves inflated self-esteem, decreased need for sleep, 
distractibility, rapid speech, increased energy, excessive indulgences 
in high-risk behaviors (such as foolish business endeavors), and lack 
of judgment. Although some with mania report extremely high moods, 
most people with mania do things that are not in their best interests. 
And they usually crash at some point. Bipolar disorder involves 
alternations between manic and depressive states.
 
If you experience symptoms of a mood disorder, you should get them checked 
out. Left untreated, mood disorders can lead to serious problems. For a more 
thorough review of mood disorders, see Depression For Dummies by yours 
truly and Bipolar Disorder For Dummies by Candida Fink (both published by 
Wiley).
Anxiety disorders
In Chapter 2, we note that OCD has traditionally been considered an anxiety 
disorder. So it shouldn’t be surprising to know that those with OCD are at 
higher risk than other people for also having additional anxiety disorders. 
Symptoms of anxiety disorders include:
 
 Avoidance of people and places
 
 Excessive worry
 
 Fears of losing control
 
 Feelings of impending doom
 
 Hyper alertness
 
 Intense fears
 
 Panic attacks
 
 Tension

52
Part I: The Ins and Outs of OCD 
 
If you experience symptoms of an anxiety disorder, you should get them 
checked out. Left untreated, anxiety disorders can lead to problems with 
health, relationships, and work. For a more thorough review of anxiety 
disorders, see our book Overcoming Anxiety For Dummies (Wiley).
Attention deficit disorders (ADD)
The various attention deficit disorders involve problems with attention, 
impulsivity, and/or hyperactivity. Attentional problems include trouble stay-
ing focused, making careless errors, losing everyday items, forgetfulness, and 
distractibility. Little kids with hyperactivity can’t stay in their seats at school 
whereas adults with hyperactivity may remain seated, but look physically rest-
less and have problems staying with a single activity. People with impulsivity 
talk before they think, have trouble waiting in line, and often interrupt others.
People diagnosed with OCD frequently receive an additional diagnosis of 
one of the attention deficit disorders. And undoubtedly, sometimes this diag-
nosis is accurate. However, clinically we see people whose obsessions and 
compulsions have interfered with their ability to focus, perform their jobs, 
or complete assignments. In other words, OCD consumes lots of attentional 
resources. In some of those folks, treating the OCD is likely to greatly alleviate 
what appears to be ADD.
Substance abuse
People with OCD suffer a lot of distress. It’s no surprise that some of them 
may turn to substance abuse (alcohol, prescription drugs, illegal substances, 
and so forth) as a way of coping with their worries. In general, when sub-
stance abuse accompanies OCD, treatment becomes a little more compli-
cated. However, excellent interventions exist for both problems and should 
be considered when they occur together.
 
Sometimes shame holds people back from seeking the help they need. Mental-
health and medical specialists are accustomed to dealing with issues like 
substance abuse and OCD. They view them as problems to be solved rather 
than character weaknesses. Please don’t let embarrassment prevent you from 
getting help.
Personality disorders
People with healthy personalities have satisfying relationships and live mean-
ingful lives. They can handle stress effectively and solve most problems of 
daily living. For the most part, they understand their feelings and those of 
others. They tend to be resilient and flexible.

53
 Chapter 3: Meeting the Relatives and Associates of OCD
On the other hand, people with personality disorders demonstrate a wide vari-
ety of longstanding, rigid patterns of behavior and problems relating to others. 
These patterns interfere with living, relationships, work, and play. These prob-
lems are quite wide-ranging and most people with a personality disorder have 
only some of them. But in order to give you a sense of the personality disorders, 
here are a few of the types of problems associated with them:
 
 A paranoid distrust of others
 
 A pervasive sense of inferiority
 
 A sense of inner emptiness and meaninglessness
 
 An exaggerated sense of entitlement
 
 Excessive need for attention
 
 Excessively intense emotional reactions to events
 
 Intense fears of abandonment
 
 Preoccupation with self-glorification
 
 Seeing people as either all good or totally evil
 
 Stubbornly needing to be right
 
 Taking pleasure in manipulating other people
OCD versus OCPD
There’s a particular personality disorder 
known as obsessive-compulsive personality 
disorder (OCPD). You may assume that most of 
those with OCD would also suffer from OCPD. 
Although those with OCD do have an elevated 
risk of OCPD, most people with OCD do not also 
have OCPD.
People with OCPD tend to:
  Be excessively dedicated to work and 
productivity
  Be perfectionists
  Be preoccupied with control
  Be self-righteous
  Demonstrate excessive frugality and fear of 
spending money
  Exhibit rigid, rule-bound thinking
  Have a reduced need for friendships and 
leisure versus work
  Have an excessive need for orderliness and 
rules
  See recreation as serious work
In other words, OCPD has a plodding, chronic 
pattern of general rigidity, orderliness, righ-
teousness, and perfectionism. Although this list 
of OCPD tendencies may seem a little like OCD, 
OCPD does not include specific obsessions or 
compulsions (see Chapter 2 for more information 
about obsessions and compulsions).

Blaming the Brain for OCD
In This Chapter
 Recognizing the part genetics may play in OCD
 Discovering the roles played by four main regions of the brain
 Following the worry circuitry of normal and OCD brains
 Listening in on conversations between neurons
Just a few hundred years ago, many people believed that obsessive-
compulsive disorder (OCD) symptoms were signs of demonic possession. 
People prayed over, exorcised, or scorned OCD sufferers. Life for those with 
OCD improved only slightly when Sigmund Freud came along and blamed OCD 
on hidden desires or early traumatic experiences. Neither approach was very 
helpful.
Today, OCD is considered a disorder involving brain function, emotions, and 
behavior; there may even be a link between OCD and infections. What all this 
means is that OCD can appear in well-adjusted, smart, normal people without 
a history of trauma or deep-seated emotional problems. In this chapter, we 
discuss how the brain plays a critical role in the development of OCD.
Looking at the Brain’s Role in OCD
The brain governs perception, thinking, memory, behaviors, and emotions. 
Thus, the brain plays a major role in all emotional disorders, including OCD. 
But saying the brain is heavily involved with OCD isn’t quite the same as 
saying that OCD is a brain disease and nothing more. In actuality, you can’t 
really separate the brain, behavior, thoughts, and the environment. All of 
these contributors interact in intricate ways — and they can’t be considered 
as operating in isolation, independently from one another.

56
Part I: The Ins and Outs of OCD 
In other words, every single thought that you have is generated by neurons 
communicating inside some portion of your brain. Medications that change 
the way the brain functions also change the way people think. Alternatively, 
therapies designed to change the way people think have been shown to 
change the way the brain functions as well.
To date, no one can point to specific biological processes that directly cause 
OCD (infections are an exception — see the sidebar “PANDAS: Part of the 
puzzle,” later in this chapter). However, brain circuitry appears to work a 
little differently in those with OCD versus those who do not have OCD. No 
one knows for sure whether biological processes, learning, genetics, or 
environmental events contribute the most to that circuitry going awry.
Connecting genetics with OCD
Biological and genetic factors that impact the brain clearly assume some of 
the blame for OCD, as these factors significantly increase the risk of develop-
ing the disorder. Many studies support a genetic predisposition for OCD, that 
is, the idea that OCD runs in families. If several members of your family have 
OCD, you run a risk of developing symptoms. If you have an identical twin 
with OCD, your risk is even higher. However, the particular way the disorder 
is inherited is not yet clear.
OCD has many faces, and the face shown by OCD in the parent may differ 
from that seen in the child. For example, a mother who has the kind of OCD 
in which she checks door locks can give birth to a son who is obsessed about 
germs and a daughter with no signs of OCD.
OCD seems to be biologically or genetically linked to Tourette’s syndrome (tics 
involving sudden movements such as grimacing, eye-blinking, grunts, or throat-
clearing). OCD sufferers are much more likely to develop tics, and people with 
tics are more likely to develop OCD. This holds true for families as well as indi-
viduals. Families in which OCD is prevalent are more likely to also have family 
members with tic disorder (for more information on tics, see Chapter 3).
Getting inside your head
Knowledge of the brain — its structures, functions, and biochemical 
processes — has accumulated rapidly since the 1980s. In part, that’s 
because we now have highly sophisticated, safe ways of observing the 
brain at work. These imaging assessment methods have allowed scientists 
to increasingly understand the ways in which the OCD brain works both 
before and after treatment. At this time, OCD is not diagnosed via brain 
scans, but they do enable us to see how treatments affect the brain. Some 
of these modern methods for viewing the brain in action are

57
 Chapter 4: Blaming the Brain for OCD
 
 Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scans: PET scans involve inject-
ing a small quantity of radioactive glucose into the bloodstream. Brain 
cells use glucose as fuel to perform their jobs. The PET scan observes 
these cells as they work and metabolize the injected glucose. On PET 
scans, the most active brain areas show up in different colors than less 
active regions. PET scans are not typically used to examine children’s 
brains because small amounts of radiation exposure are involved.
 
 Computerized Axial Tomography (CAT or CT) Scan: The CAT scan uses 
multiple X-ray images to produce 3-D pictures of the brain (and other 
body organs). It can reveal brain damage and brain activity. The CAT 
scan is often used to evaluate injuries to the brain. Studies of brain 
injuries have provided some pieces of the OCD/brain puzzle.
 
 Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI): The MRI produces a huge magnetic 
field that reveals detailed images of the brain. Unlike the PET scan, MRIs 
do not use radioactive material. The MRI is best at viewing brain struc-
tures rather than their activity. The MRI can show minor changes to the 
brain following stroke or injury.
 
 Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI): The fMRI is a type of 
MRI. It can view blood flow in the brain, which changes according to 
what the brain is doing. Therefore, it can show brain activity while a 
person performs various tasks, including thinking, looking, touching, 
problem solving, or focusing on various emotions.
 
 Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS): The MRS is another form of 
an MRI. This amazing technique can actually reveal neurotransmitters in 
the brain at work.
 
 Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT): The SPECT 
technique takes images from multiple angles and constructs a 3-D pic-
ture. This technology may ultimately allow diagnosis of dementias in 
their early stages.
Knowledge gleaned from these sophisticated imaging techniques has enabled 
scientists to increase their understanding of the relationship between the 
brain and OCD.
In the following sections, we take a close look at how the brain functions in 
relation to OCD. We look at
 
 The areas of the brain
 
 The circuitry of the brain
 
 The transmitters of the brain

Part I: The Ins and Outs of OCD 
Exploring Four Regions of the Brain
The brain is an amazing collection of cells and connections intertwined with 
a vast network of blood vessels. The average adult brain weighs around 3 
pounds. Within those 3 pounds are two types of cells — neurons and glia.
 
 Neurons: The brain has about 100 billion neurons (give or take). 
Neurons are the cells that communicate with one another. They order 
muscles to move and generate thoughts. They congregate in groups. 
Each group communicates within itself as well as with other neuronal 
groups in the brain.
 
 Glia: Your brain has about ten times as many glia cells as it does neu-
rons. Glia cells help out by protecting and nourishing the neurons as 
well as keeping the house clean by removing waste and dead neurons.
Neurons and glia come in many specific forms depending upon the type of 
work they are called upon to do. They form the basic structures of the brain 
described in the next four sections.
 
The anatomy of the brain has been studied for thousands of years. Various 
scientists have labeled brain structures using Latin words, Greek words, num-
bers, and letters. Some areas are even named for the people who first described 
them. Maybe some of them are named after favorite dogs or lovers. Who knows? 
Needless to say, the language of brain anatomy can be daunting. Making matters 
even more complex, various areas of the brain have been given different labels 
over time, and brain structures are sometimes combined in different ways.
We provide an overview of one of the many ways in which the brain can be 
divided into global regions. In the sections that follow, we explore the four regions 
known as the hindbrain, the midbrain, the diencephalon, and the forebrain.
 
Hold your fist straight up. Think of your forearm as your spinal cord and hind 
brain. Your wrist represents your midbrain. Your fist is analogous to the dien-
cephalon. Now, imagine putting on a boxing glove. The boxing glove is the 
equivalent of your forebrain, the largest part of the human brain. Or, if you’re 
not good at imagining your fist as your brain, take a look at Figure 4-1 for an 
illustration of the four major regions of the brain.
Hiding out with the hindbrain
The hindbrain contains structures that have to do with breathing, swallow-
ing, heartbeat, gagging, muscle tone, wakefulness, and arousal. Pretty basic 
stuff. A serious blow to the hindbrain can mean lights out. The cerebellum, 
within the hindbrain, is thought to help coordinate posture and motor con-
trol. At this time, there doesn’t appear to be much of a relationship between 
OCD and the hindbrain.

Minding the midbrain
The midbrain coordinates auditory and visual information. The midbrain 
is essential for awareness of your surroundings as it orients you to sights, 
sounds, and sensations. For example, if your ears hear a shout behind you, 
your midbrain tells you to turn around and look for the source. If you feel a 
burning sensation in your foot, your midbrain directs you to pick up your 
foot and see what’s going on. If your eyes then tell you that you’re walking on 
hot coals, you know to jump.
Preliminary studies suggest that the midbrain may play a role in OCD. 
Neurotransmitters such as serotonin (see the section “Singling out serotonin 
and dopamine,” later in this chapter) apparently are less available in this 
brain region among those who suffer from OCD. This reduced availability of 
serotonin may cause problems with attention and aggravate OCD.

60
Part I: The Ins and Outs of OCD 
Deciphering the diencephalon
The diencephalon consists of two major parts — the thalamus and the 
hypothalamus. Both of these are thought to be involved in OCD.
The thalamus
The thalamus receives, interprets, and integrates information from multiple 
sites in the brain, including those involved with hearing, seeing, touching, 
tasting, and smelling. The thalamus sends this information on to other regions 
in the forebrain.
The thalamus has been shown to be overly active and even larger in size in 
some studies of OCD sufferers. Other studies have demonstrated that the 
thalamus appears to normalize after treatment with either medication (see 
Chapter 11) or Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (see Chapters 8, 9, and 10).
The hypothalamus
Less direct information is known about the role of the hypothalamus in OCD. 
The hypothalamus is a highly complex structure that functions to keep these 
bodily processes in balance:
 
 Body temperature
 
 Circadian rhythm
 
 Fatigue
 
 Hunger
 
 Sexual behavior
 
 Thirst
The hypothalamus also coordinates a variety of hormones and endocrines. 
Some studies suggest that the hypothalamus is involved in OCD. This seems 
highly likely, given its critical role in overall brain functioning.
Finding the forebrain
The forebrain is the largest region of the human brain. It includes the cerebral 
cortex, the basal ganglia, and the limbic system. From an evolutionary stand-
point, the forebrain was the most recent portion of the brain to develop. In a 
global sense, the forebrain is responsible for advanced planning, judgment, 
and integrating sensory information with logic.

61
 Chapter 4: Blaming the Brain for OCD
The cerebral cortex
The cerebral cortex is an area of the forebrain. It makes up the wrinkled out-
side layer of the brain. The cerebral cortex governs reasoning, abstract think-
ing, planning, organizing, and bringing us sensations from the outside world 
to form what we know as reality. The cerebral cortex can be divided into two 
hemispheres: right and left. It can also be subdivided into four lobes: frontal, 
temporal, parietal, and occipital.
The orbital frontal cortex (a part of the frontal lobe lying above the eyeballs) 
appears to be especially important in OCD. The orbital frontal cortex regu-
lates planning, decision-making, and how one processes consequences. 
The orbital frontal cortex also helps detect errors. It is closely connected 
with the emotional centers of the brain. Those with OCD report trouble with 
decision-making, planning, and over-interpreting danger and peril.
The basal ganglia
The basal ganglia, sometimes referred to as the striatum, are nuclei in the 
forebrain that primarily function to control movement. The basal ganglia turn 
thoughts into actions (for example, translating the idea of walking into actual 
walking, or going from thinking about picking up a chocolate bar to the act 
of putting the bar into your mouth). The basal ganglia serve as a relay sta-
tion among the thalamus, the cerebral cortex, and the hindbrain. The basal 
ganglia as a whole appear to help with the ability to inhibit responses. As we 
discuss in Chapter 3, irrepressible impulses represent a problem for many 
who have OCD.
 
The basal ganglia are most affected by Parkinson’s disease. People with this 
disorder are not able to get their bodies to move in the way their brains want 
them to (that is, they can’t translate thoughts into actions). They have trouble 
initiating movement and switching from one task to another.
 
Many books on OCD refer to various structures within the basal ganglia. 
Research has shown that these structures have a link with OCD, but don’t get 
hung up on the jargon. Just know that when you see the following terms, they 
are referring to some part of the basal ganglia:
 
 Putamen
 
 Caudate nucleus
 
 Globus Pallidus
 
 Substantia nigra (associated with the basal ganglia, but actually located 
in the midbrain)

62
Part I: The Ins and Outs of OCD 
The limbic system
The limbic system takes on critical jobs having to do with human motivation, 
emotion, and memory. Three main structures in the limbic system include:
 
 The amygdala: This structure processes emotional information, which 
just happens to be most of what makes life feel fulfilling and meaningful. 
The amygdala also sounds an alarm when threatening events occur — 
even before you consciously know what’s going on. People who suffer 
damage to the amygdala lose much of the ability to process emotions — 
good or bad — along with the early warning system.
 
 The amygdala is the seat of memories that stir the emotions — every-
thing from love to fear. That’s why you remember emotionally mean-
ingful events like where you were when you first heard about 9-11 as 
opposed to what you did on 9-10 (unless that’s your birthday). The 
amygdala is more active in those with OCD when they encounter situ-
ations that relate to their particular type of OCD — like contamination, 
checking, or superstitions.
 
 The hippocampus: This part of the limbic system is critical for forming 
new memories and learning. The hippocampus also stores information 
about where you are and how to get to the places you want to go. People 
with damage to the hippocampus become disoriented and have severe 
memory problems. Those with Alzheimer’s or severe alcohol-related 
brain damage usually have a damaged hippocampus. The role of the hip-
pocampus in OCD is probably somewhat less significant than the roles 
of the other limbic structures.
 
 The cingulate gyrus: This structure influences what you pay attention 
to. The cingulate gyrus receives emotional information and regulates 
responses to pain and aggression. This part of the limbic system is 
responsible for feelings of intense dread. Those with OCD often report 
fear and dread concerning what will happen if they don’t carry out 
their compulsions. And studies have demonstrated that the cingulate 
gyrus goes into overdrive among those who have symptoms of OCD, as 
opposed to those without such symptoms.
Tracing the Brain’s Circuitry
Think of the brain as an orchestra with a variety of sections coordinating 
their parts to produce a pleasant-sounding symphony. If the sections of the 
orchestra don’t communicate well because the conductor isn’t doing a good 
job, the entire performance collapses. The OCD orchestra is conducted by 
the orbital frontal cortex (see the preceding section, “Finding the forebrain”), 
and trouble arises when groups of uncooperative musicians in the brain 
ignore or overwhelm the conductor.

 Chapter 4: Blaming the Brain for OCD
We describe some of the basic neurobiological processes as they appear to 
operate with many types of OCD. However, certain subtypes of OCD (such as 
hoarding; see Chapters 2 and 16), and certain relatives of OCD (see Chapter 
3), probably work differently. Many of the same brain structures are likely 
involved, but less is known about the precise ways in which these structures 
impact these other subtypes of OCD or related disorders.
In OCD, several sections of the brain play too loudly or out of rhythm with 
other sections, disrupting the melodic flow of the brain. Jeffrey Schwartz, 
M.D., from the University of California at Los Angeles, presented what he 
called brain lock. He described the brains of people with OCD as stuck in a 
circuit of activation that feeds the obsessions and compulsions of OCD.
The worry circuit starts with the orbital frontal cortex, which is overly active 
and transmits false alarms. The alarms are sent to part of the basal ganglia 
(especially the caudate nucleus), part of the limbic system (particularly the 
cingulate gyrus), and the thalamus. These sections are more active in the 
brains of people with OCD.
The normal brain puts out a few false alarms too, but manages to detect and 
repress the response to them. An OCD brain lacks the ability to inhibit or put 
brakes on the reaction to false alarms. The following two stories about Ben 
and Brad illustrate the normal brain’s response to false alarms versus the 
response of the OCD brain.
Ben wakes up at 3 a.m. and thinks, “I think I left the stove on; maybe 
I need to go check. I’d hate to burn the house down.” His orbital fron-
tal cortex sends a mild signal of alarm throughout the worry circuit. 
However, Ben’s worry circuit doesn’t go into high gear. Various parts 
of his brain process the information and he concludes, “Well, it’s pretty 
darn unlikely that I left the stove on. I never have before. I’m pretty 
comfortable right now; it doesn’t seem worth getting up. Besides, I have 
smoke detectors.” Ben turns over and goes back to sleep.
Brad wakes up at 3 a.m. and has the same thought as Ben, “Gosh, I think 
I might have left the stove on; maybe I need to go check. I’d hate to burn 
the house down.” Brad has OCD and his orbital frontal lobe screams a 
message to the rest of his worry circuit. Brad’s heart races and his entire 
body fills with dread. He jumps out of bed to check the stove. He feels 
relief when he sees that it’s turned off. He returns to bed. Then he thinks, 
“Maybe I didn’t really check the stove carefully enough. Did I check all 
the burners?” The worry circuit reactivates and sends Brad scrambling to 
check the stove again. The entire process is repeated many times before 
Ben can settle down and go back to sleep.
The contrasting stories of Ben and Brad illustrate how the brain circuitry in 
people with OCD differs from that of non-sufferers. They both experienced a 
worrisome thought, but Ben’s brain responded in a realistic manner, whereas 
Brad’s OCD brain made him feel that the house was in imminent danger.

64
Part I: The Ins and Outs of OCD 
Additional evidence supporting the idea that these brain structures and 
the ways they communicate are involved with OCD can be found in the fact 
that injury to any of these areas sometimes results in OCD-like symptoms. 
Even more intriguing is the fact that surgery designed to cut the connections 
between some of these brain structures appears to improve OCD symptoms. 
As we discuss in Chapter 11, this approach to OCD is reserved for extremely 
severe cases that have repeatedly failed to respond to numerous other 
treatments — not something to be tried at home.
Transmitting Thoughts 
between Brain Cells
Brain neurons communicate with each other through a sophisticated system 
that involves both energy and chemistry. Neurons have a cell body and pro-
jections that assist in communication. Axons are the projections that trans-
mit information from the cell body toward the next cell. Dendrites are the 
projections that collect information from other cells. Axons and dendrites 
transmit their information across something known as a synaptic cleft. The 
cleft is a small space between axons and dendrites.
Using electricity and chemicals 
to communicate
Communication among brain neurons starts with an electrical impulse in the 
cell body that is transmitted down the axon toward another cell. Once the 
impulse arrives at the presynaptic ending (or terminal), substances known as 
neurotransmitters are released. These neurotransmitters function as 
chemical messengers between cells.
Neurotransmitters are released from one neuron and travel across the synap-
tic cleft. There, most are vacuumed up by a receiving neuron at the postsyn-
aptic receptor site. From the postsynaptic receptor site, an electrical impulse 
travels down the dendrite toward the receiving cell body. Some of the neuro-
transmitters don’t make it to the receiving cell and return to the sending cell. 
See Figure 4-2 for an illustration of how this process works.

Neurotransmitters
Singling out serotonin and dopamine
Scientists continue to discover new types of neurotransmitters. Currently, 
two transmitters — serotonin and dopamine — seem to be particularly 
related to the brain functioning of people with OCD. These transmitters 
follow circuits through different regions of the brain and are thought to be 
central to mood, energy level, and behavior. Serotonin and dopamine form 
the basis of the serotonergic system and the dopaminergic system, respec-
tively. Although much remains to be determined about how and why these 
systems cause problems in the brain, the following has been discovered:
 
 Serotonergic System: This system is involved in wakefulness and mood. 
Disruptions in serotonin are related to OCD, anxiety, depressed moods, 
eating disorders, tics, aggression, and impulsivity.
 
 Medications that increase the availability of serotonin have been found to 
help most people with OCD. Some report that they continue to have obses-
sive thoughts, but are able to cope with their feelings without acting on 
compulsions (see Chapter 2 for more about obsessions and compulsions).
 
 Dopaminergic System: This area is involved in maintaining smooth 
movement. It is also involved in the reward system of the brain and 
seems to be related to addictions. Parkinson’s disease, a condition in 
which people experience tremors and muscle rigidity, is associated 
with decreased availability of dopamine. Schizophrenia, a disorder that 

66
Part I: The Ins and Outs of OCD 
involves disorganized thinking, is related to too much dopamine. OCD 
and Tourette’s syndrome (see Chapter 3) also appear to involve 
disruption in the dopaminergic system.
 
 Drugs that block dopamine have been found to be effective in treating 
tics as well as repetitive behaviors. Drugs that increase dopamine can 
induce tics and symptoms of OCD. See Chapter 11 for more information 
about medication and OCD.
 
People check the oil level in their cars by using a dipstick to see if more is 
needed. No dipstick equivalent exists to check the levels of neurotransmission 
in the brain. That’s why sometimes multiple medications that target these 
areas need to be tried before the right one is found (see Chapter 11 for more 
information about medication).
PANDAS: Part of the puzzle
So, what do Chinese bears that eat bamboo 
have to do with OCD? Nothing, really. PANDAS 
is the abbreviation for Pediatric Autoimmune 
Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with 
Streptococcal Infection. Whew. No wonder 
they’re called PANDAS.
PANDAS describe children or teens who sud-
denly develop OCD symptoms or tics (see 
Chapter 3 for more on tics and Tourette’s syn-
drome) following a strep throat. Other infec-
tions, such as a complication of rheumatic fever 
called Sydenham’s Chorea and some types of 
encephalitis, also can result in these or similar 
symptoms. Symptoms develop rapidly, almost 
overnight. Kids usually have tics, obsessions, 
compulsions, and lots of irritability. This sudden 
onset of symptoms gradually improves unless 
another strep throat comes along.
Researchers believe that PANDAS occur when 
the body produces antibodies to combat the 
strep infection. These antibodies do a good job 
of fighting off the infection. However, some-
times, in some kids, the good guys (antibodies) 
go after the wrong bad guy. In PANDAS, the 
antibodies attack the basal ganglia in the brain, 
which in turn leads to OCD and/or tics.
The use of antibiotics for the treatment of 
PANDAS is currently being investigated and 
shows some promise. If antibiotics work, they 
will do so quickly; otherwise, treatment of 
PANDAS is conducted in the same way as for 
other types of OCD and has about the same 
effectiveness. Refer to Chapters 20 and 21 for 
more on OCD and kids.

Developing and Reinforcing OCD
In This Chapter
 Looking at how OCD begins
 Rewarding OCD inadvertently
 Reviewing faulty reasoning
H
ow does obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) begin and why does 
it develop in some people and not others? OCD symptoms often start 
in childhood and get worse without treatment. But the disorder can also 
manifest in adults. In Chapter 4, we discuss the biological basis for OCD. But 
biology and the brain are not the only culprits in its development. The envi-
ronment, experiences, and thinking styles are also important in the genesis 
and maintenance of OCD.
OCD can become more entrenched through the innocent reinforcement of 
others. It can also worsen because of the wrong thinking patterns exhibited 
by OCD sufferers.
In this chapter, we reveal the childhood experiences that may contribute to 
the development of OCD. Next, we describe how OCD is maintained and 
reinforced by giving in to its demands. Finally, we run down the problems 
worsened by the way the OCD mind thinks.
 
An obsession is an intrusive thought, urge, or image. Compulsions are repeti-
tive mental acts or behaviors. Both obsessions and compulsions cause mental 
distress because they are unwanted, time-consuming, and feel completely 
unacceptable to the sufferer.
Developing OCD as a Child or Adult
More often than for other emotional disorders, such as anxiety and depres-
sion, the origins of OCD can be traced to childhood where both nature and 
nurture play roles. Parents are usually quite well-intentioned, but sometimes 
their efforts to protect or teach their kids go too far and provide fertile 
ground for the development of OCD.

68
Part I: The Ins and Outs of OCD 
But OCD can also crop up in adulthood for a number of reasons. In most 
instances, OCD occurs in adults who have shown some predisposition or 
symptoms of OCD in childhood. However, OCD can also occur in adults who 
have no such obvious predispositions but who have suffered a serious infec-
tion, head injury, trauma, or major life change. In this section, we examine 
potential roots of OCD in childhood, as well as look at some of the likely 
triggers for adult-onset OCD.
Developing OCD early
Have you ever observed the bedtime routines of typical 2-year-old children? 
Many have elaborate rituals that they insist their parents follow. These 
patterns of behavior are rigid and serve to ease children into sleep.
Most children have some anxiety over separating from their mothers or 
fathers at nighttime. Having rituals helps young children make that separa-
tion from awake during the day to asleep at night more securely. In the fol-
lowing example, Alaina illustrates a normal, albeit time-consuming, bedtime 
routine.
Two-year-old Alaina’s mom starts the process shortly after dinner. “Time for 
your bath; let’s pick up your toys,” she tells her. Alaina insists on lining up all 
of her stuffed animals and dolls on a bench in her room. She places each one 
carefully in an order only she understands. If her mom moves one, she gets 
upset and rearranges them so that they’re just right.
Other toys are tossed into a toy chest. Next is the bath. Again, she has cer-
tain toys for the water. She allows her mom to wash her, but is busy in a pat-
tern of play, singing a song, and carefully arranging her water toys in order 
on the edge of the tub. After the bath and getting into her pajamas, Alaina 
chooses three books. Her mother must read them in a certain order.
Then to bed. The comforter must be placed with a certain pattern showing. 
She has a blanket that she holds onto and three stuffed bears that sleep next 
to her. The closet door must be completely closed and the blinds up one 
inch so that a little light from the street shines through. A family picture sits 
on the night stand, angled so that Alaina can see it from her bed. Alaina likes 
to have her mom sit with her for a couple of minutes. Then there’s a short 
prayer, a kiss, and mom says “Good-night, I love you forever.”
Alaina’s story, which is cute and perfectly normal, shows how rituals and 
conventions can help a child feel cozy and secure. However, these rituals 
can also point to the first signs of impending OCD. The change from normal 
to OCD is thought to happen due to unknown mixtures of biology and early 
experiences (nature and nurture).

69
 Chapter 5: Developing and Reinforcing OCD
Childhood experiences can involve well-intentioned but misguided parenting, 
trauma, stress, or other negative events. They can also involve a child modeling 
or adopting the behaviors of a parent who suffers from OCD.
 
If family members have OCD, the probability of a child having OCD is higher. 
This increased probability could be a result of children learning OCD behav-
iors from their parents. But this increased risk could also be a result of genet-
ics. See Chapter 4 for more info on genetics and biological causes of OCD. 
In fact, in one person, OCD may be entirely the result of genetics, while in 
another it may be entirely the result of the environment, while in a third it may 
be due to a combination of the two. Pinning down the cause of OCD in any 
individual case is pretty much impossible.
Good intentions; bad results
Early childhood experiences shape personalities and can set the stage for 
the development of later emotional difficulties, such as OCD. Parents have 
tremendous influence over their children. They generally mean well and want 
only what’s best for their kids. The concepts they may introduce their chil-
dren to are intended to have a positive effect. If taken too far, however, these 
intentions may boomerang and contribute to a child’s OCD.
 
Misguided or bad parenting is not the primary cause of OCD. OCD is a com-
plicated disorder that involves the brain as well as learning. However, experi-
ences do influence the occurrence of OCD symptoms and how severe OCD 
becomes. See Chapters 20 and 21 for more information about OCD in children.
Giving too much information
Good parents warn their children about dangers. But sometimes children are 
exposed to information that they’re not ready to handle. For example, sternly 
warning 3-year-olds to stay away from strangers because people they don’t 
know might kidnap them won’t keep 3-year-olds safe. A 3-year-old who hears 
this information may develop intense fear of any unknown person. This fear 
can lead to obsessional thinking about various dangers in the world. Making 
sure 3-year-old children are never left unsupervised is better than frightening 
them.
Modeling misguided thinking
Parents want to teach their kids appropriate behavior. But in doing so, some-
times parents inadvertently teach their children that having bad thoughts 
means they’re bad people. The story about Tom that follows illustrates how 
such teaching can foster OCD thinking (see the section “Worsening OCD with 
Bad Thinking,” later in this chapter).
Five-year-old Tom loves to play with his Legos. He builds castles and 
towers. When Tom’s 3-year-old sister Michelle knocks over his tower, 
Tom pushes her and shouts, “Get out of my room, you creep; I hate you!” 
Tom’s father overhears the ruckus and tells Tom, “You should always 
love your sister; God punishes kids who have thoughts like that!”

70
Part I: The Ins and Outs of OCD 
Tom’s father may have gone overboard and frightened his son. Though his 
intentions were honorable (wanting Tom to love his sister), he used a scare 
tactic that can lead to OCD-like thinking. In particular, Tom’s dad suggested 
that merely having bad thoughts equates with being a bad person — a style of 
thinking quite common in OCD. Thinking is not the same as doing, but kids can 
be convinced that they’re bad people if they have greedy, mean, or even illogi-
cal thoughts. What starts as a random thought can become an obsession.
Seeking perfection
Parents naturally want children to put their best effort into everything they 
do, but parents can scare their children by telling them they must do things 
perfectly or not at all. The saying, “If it’s worth doing, it’s worth doing right,” 
can be pushed too far. Children who feel they must do everything perfectly 
sometimes stop trying altogether because they’re afraid of making mistakes. 
(See the section “Needing everything perfect,” later in this chapter, for more 
on the role of perfectionism in OCD.)
Overprotecting
Parents are right in thinking that it’s their job to protect their children, but 
they may contribute to the development of OCD if they become overprotec-
tive and never allow their children to goof up or assume any responsibility. 
Parents who fall into this trap end up sending a message to their kids that 
they’re not capable of dealing with the world. These kids sometimes grow up 
believing that the world is a dangerous place and that they have little control.
When bad things happen
Bad things happen to children and their families. When these experiences 
occur, they can start a pattern of worry and fear. These initial fears can 
contribute to the development of OCD in children who are susceptible.
Illness
Children who suffer from a serious illness or have close family members 
who are sick often believe that the illness could have been prevented. For 
example, a child may be told that if he doesn’t wash his hands he’ll get sick. 
He then actually does get very sick and believes that it’s his fault because he 
didn’t wash his hands. Thereafter, he spends more and more time washing 
his hands. Or a girl whose grandmother gets cancer believes it happened 
because her grandmother didn’t pray at night. She may start performing 
rituals to protect herself and other family members.
Accidents
Accidents happen every day. Children, their friends, or family members are 
often involved in car accidents. Children are exposed to other accidents by 
overhearing adult conversations, reading the newspaper, or hearing the news 
on television. Because accidents are frightening and difficult for children to 
understand, kids often invent ways to protect themselves by using magical 

71
 Chapter 5: Developing and Reinforcing OCD
chants, rituals, or avoidance. The story below about 8-year-old Austin illus-
trates how a ritual may emerge after an accident.
Austin returns home from a visit at his cousin’s house. On the way, his 
parents’ car is rear-ended by a drunk driver. His brother is seriously 
injured. Luckily, no one else in the car is hurt. Austin thinks he hears 
someone ask about the seat belts. Austin jumps to the conclusion that 
his brother did not correctly fasten his seat belt. In the ensuing weeks, 
Austin starts checking to see whether his belt is fastened “just right.” 
At first, he buckles and unbuckles it several times before allowing his 
mother to pull out of the driveway. This activity gradually develops into 
a complex pattern — including locking and unlocking the car doors, posi-
tioning himself “just so” in the seat, and fastening and unfastening his 
seat belt until the click sounds “just right.” This ritual must be performed 
every time he gets into the family car. His ritual starts consuming a lot of 
time, and then he starts other “protective” rituals. Austin develops a 
full-blown case of OCD.
Austin’s story shows how easily children can develop OCD from their 
attempts to understand and cope with traumatic events. The symptoms 
sometimes start out making a little bit of sense (such as Austin carefully 
checking his seat belt), but evolve into activities that have little to do with 
anything that could realistically serve to protect.
Stress
When children are exposed to lots of stress, symptoms of OCD become 
worse. No study has directly linked a stressful event to the start of OCD; how-
ever, plenty of evidence suggests that stress leads to an increase in distorted 
thinking, which is characteristic of OCD.
Children may have a bad thought, such as wanting a younger sibling to be 
hurt. In rare cases, the sibling actually gets hurt sometime later. Children 
who experience bad thoughts that happen to come true may believe that 
their thoughts cause bad things to happen.
For example, a girl wishes that her father would stop yelling at her mother. 
Sometimes she has thoughts of hating her father when he yells. Later, her par-
ents get a divorce and her father moves out. She believes that her thoughts 
of hating her father and wishing that he’d stop yelling caused him to leave. 
Thinking that thoughts cause events to happen is typical of OCD thinking. For 
more on this, see the later section, “Worsening OCD with Bad Thinking.”
Stress can also develop from giving children too much responsibility before 
they’re developmentally ready. For example, an older child who has to 
assume care for younger siblings can become overwhelmed by the respon-
sibility. The older child worries about somehow hurting the younger ones. 
The child in charge of his siblings develops an OCD style of thinking that we 
discuss further in the section, “Being too responsible.”

72
Part I: The Ins and Outs of OCD 
Trauma
Unfortunately, many children experience abuse or trauma. These events trig-
ger worry and fear. Some children react with anger or depression. Others 
develop symptoms of OCD. For example, a boy who is at a bank with his 
father when it’s robbed starts to worry about making sure the doors and win-
dows at his house are locked. His daily checking routine starts each evening 
and involves both of his parents. He also frequently asks his parents to check 
throughout the house before he goes to bed.
Learning by seeing
Children learn from watching their parents. Thus, parents who exhibit OCD 
can inadvertently teach or model OCD to their children. The following exam-
ple of Jane demonstrates how a parent with OCD can pass it along without 
intending to do so.
Jane (a mother with OCD) worries about contamination. She obsesses 
about germs and the possibility of her or her family coming down with 
a serious illness. In order to protect everyone, Jane compulsively cleans 
the house with bleach for hours every day. She warns her children about 
all the dangers from germs. She makes her kids take baths every morning 
and before bed — as well as when they return home from school or play 
outside. Her children listen and accept their mother’s fears as being rea-
sonable. Therefore, they begin to fear getting contaminated themselves.
Jane shows how a mother with OCD can model and teach her children to 
develop the disorder, quite possibly whether they have a genetic predispo-
sition or not. However, not every child with a parent like Jane will develop 
OCD. Some kids may be more resistant or resilient, whether due to genes or 
some other unknown factor.
Developing OCD as an adult
Sometimes adults develop OCD even though they did not suffer from it as 
children. Major life changes such as divorce, loss of loved ones, natural 
disasters, and significant financial setbacks, all can trigger the emergence of 
OCD in an adult. OCD symptoms can start gradually or have a sudden onset. 
Trauma would be particularly likely to cause a sudden onset of OCD. OCD 
is especially likely to occur in adults who tend to be anxious and/or have a 
genetic predisposition for developing OCD.

73
 Chapter 5: Developing and Reinforcing OCD
Reinforcing OCD with Positives 
and Negatives
If left alone and untreated, OCD usually gets worse. One reason that OCD 
becomes more time-consuming and more distressing is because of what psy-
chologists call reinforcement. Before we explain how reinforcement works 
specifically for OCD, here is the basic premise: Reinforcement increases the 
likelihood of something occurring. Reinforcement can be positive, negative, or 
both negative and positive.
Supporting OCD with positive 
reinforcement
Most people don’t go to work without getting a paycheck. The paycheck 
increases the likelihood of working and is therefore a positive reinforce-
ment. Dogs are trained to associate getting a reward for sitting. Dogs will sit 
for their owners when they expect to get a treat. Even when they don’t get a 
treat, they still have hope. Dog treats positively reward dog sitting.
 
Positive reinforcement can be found in encouraging words, a pat on the back, 
an ice cream cone, or a hug. Praise can also be a powerful form of positive 
reinforcement.
Trauma and PTSD versus OCD
Traumatic events frequently cause severe emo-
tional pain. One of the more common reactions 
to severe trauma is known as post-traumatic 
stress disorder (or PTSD). PTSD involves recur-
rent thoughts or images of the event and avoid-
ance of reminders of the trauma. For example, 
a soldier may have repeated images of a bomb 
exploding and avoid driving near construction 
sites and congested traffic because loud noises 
trigger the images.
Less often, trauma may trigger the onset of 
OCD. But distinguishing between OCD and 
PTSD can be tricky. If the obsessions and com-
pulsions closely relate to the traumatic event 
in some way, then PTSD is usually diagnosed 
as the only emotional disorder. However, in the 
case of the soldier, if he only obsessed about 
cleanliness and avoided public restrooms, he 
would be deemed as suffering from OCD that 
was triggered by trauma. Finally, if the soldier 
had repeated images of the bomb exploding, 
avoided driving in noisy areas, and then began 
to obsess about cleanliness, he would be suf-
fering from both PTSD and OCD.

74
Part I: The Ins and Outs of OCD 
Friends and family can fall into a trap of positively reinforcing those with 
OCD. When people you care about suffer from obsessional worries, the most 
natural thing in the world is to tell them that everything will be okay. Saying 
that everything will be alright is also known as “providing reassurance to the 
sufferer.”
Supporting OCD with negative 
reinforcement
Negative reinforcement happens when a behavior gets rid of a distressing, 
unpleasant event or feeling. Like positive reinforcement, negative reinforce-
ment increases the likelihood of a behavior occurring in the future. The 
behavior becomes more frequent because it reduces distress.
Our dog Murphy is a master at negative reinforcement. Murphy loves to be 
petted. When Murphy wants a pat, she finds any human who’s sitting down 
and purposely begins scratching that human’s kneecap. The feeling is never 
pleasant, and sometimes it’s downright painful. Murphy stops scratching as 
soon as she is petted. She knows that most people figure out quite quickly 
what she wants. So, people increase their petting because Murphy has nega-
tively reinforced them for doing so.
Between sleeping in a sunny spot, occasionally stretching, eating, and 
going outside to . . . well, you know, Murphy spends her day going back and 
forth scratching people. Sometimes she doesn’t even have to scratch them 
before they start petting her — she has trained them that well with negative 
reinforcement.
The negative reinforcement process is a little more complex when applied to 
OCD. Negative reinforcement comes into play when people with OCD experi-
ence an obsession and try to deal with it through either avoidance or com-
pulsion. The process goes like this:
 
1. Obsession: The OCD sufferer experiences an unpleasant, distressing, 
obsessive thought, urge, or image that creates anxiety.
 
2. Avoidance or compulsion: The sufferer attempts to cope with the 
obsession by avoiding it or engaging in a compulsion.
 
• Avoidance is an attempt to suppress the obsession by avoiding 
potential causes, such as staying away from things that may be 
contaminated or not driving due to fear of hitting someone.
 
• Compulsions are acts intended to neutralize the obsession, such as 
hand-washing or frequently stopping the car to see whether some-
one was hurt.

75
 Chapter 5: Developing and Reinforcing OCD
 
 In both instances, the sufferer’s anxiety is temporarily relieved.
 
3. Negative Reinforcement: Both avoidance and compulsions become 
more frequent because they succeed in temporarily reducing anxi-
ety and distress. In other words, anxiety and distress are unpleasant. 
Negative reinforcement involves a behavior that succeeds in reducing 
this unpleasantness. People tend to do things more often when they are 
negatively reinforced by having their distress reduced.
The temporary relief that people with OCD get when they try to avoid an 
obsession or act out a compulsion makes these strategies seem like they’re 
working. So, people repeat them and the cycle becomes more ingrained and 
compelling. The following example clarifies the concept.
Bert worries about dirt and germs. He particularly hates touching other 
people’s hands. When someone attempts to shake hands with him, he 
imagines filthy bathrooms and disease-carrying germs. Along with the 
image, he feels a surge of anxiety. Whenever possible, Bert avoids shak-
ing hands. When he successfully avoids a handshake, Bert feels a huge 
sense of relief (his anxiety goes down sharply). Therefore, not shaking 
hands is negatively reinforced.
If Bert is forced to shake hands, his anxiety and distress increase. He 
limply puts out his hand and withdraws it quickly. He then excuses 
himself and washes or disinfects his hands. After this act, he feels a bit 
better. So the next time he feels distress, he’s more likely to wash and 
disinfect his hands. Washing and disinfecting become more frequent 
because they’ve been negatively reinforced.
Bert’s behaviors interfere with his work and his interactions with friends 
and family. Without treatment, his OCD is likely to intensify. Bert is a typical 
example of how OCD grows and intensifies over time.
Combining positive and negative 
reinforcement: A double whammy
People with OCD ask for reassurance as a way of getting both positive and 
negative reinforcement. Positive reinforcement comes from the care and 
understanding the person receives. Negative reinforcement happens because 
the reassurance temporarily removes the feelings of worry and distress.
So, what happens when something is both positively and negatively rein-
forced? In short, it becomes more frequent. People with OCD who ask for 
reassurance do so with increasing frequency as time goes on. Yet the more 
often they ask, the more insecure they feel. A few quick examples can help 
clarify how the reassurance cycle works.

76
Part I: The Ins and Outs of OCD 
Arthur has obsessive thoughts about having sex with children. He is 
appalled by those thoughts and has never even come close to acting 
them out. He goes to confession every day. On bad days he goes to more 
than one church so that he can confess more than once. He asks each 
priest for reassurance that he will not go to hell for having bad thoughts. 
Every priest has patiently answered that thoughts are not the same as 
acts. Arthur feels momentarily better after the confession. The care and 
concern of the priest both positively and negatively reinforce Arthur 
because his anxiety is temporarily decreased and he enjoys receiving the 
concern.
Brenda believes that she has left the stove or other appliances on. She 
is often late for work because she returns home to check. She also calls 
her husband and asks him if he thinks she may have left the stove on. 
Brenda’s husband reassures her that he’s sure she turned it off. Five min-
utes later, she may call him again and ask the same question. Sometimes 
she asks about the coffeepot. Brenda’s husband loves his wife and puts 
up with frequent interruptions during his workday.
Colin lives alone. He is obsessed with order and cleanliness. His house 
is spotless. He arranges the food in his cupboards alphabetically. He 
spends hours each day arranging and rearranging his belongings. When 
something is amiss, he gets very upset. Colin seeks reassurance by call-
ing his mother 4 or 5 times a day. He asks her whether she loves him 
and whether he is a good person. His mother worries about Colin, but is 
always there for him.
Family members, counselors, and friends can unknowingly contribute to OCD 
by giving reassurance. See Chapters 21 and 22 for information about how to 
handle reassurance-seeking in children, family, or friends with OCD.
Worsening OCD with Bad Thinking
The thinking styles of those with OCD make OCD worse. These ways of think-
ing likely originate from early experiences and are perpetuated by reinforce-
ment, as discussed in earlier sections. As these ways of thinking become 
engrained, they deepen and intensify OCD. Even when peoples’ OCD origi-
nates in adulthood, it is quite possible that they developed styles of think-
ing consistent with OCD during childhood. These styles of thinking likely 
increase the risk of acquiring OCD later in life.
Everyone’s brain fills with weird thoughts, impulses, or urges once in a while. 
Having strange or scary thoughts is perfectly normal. For example:

77
 Chapter 5: Developing and Reinforcing OCD
 
 You’re walking down stairs carrying an infant, and you fear you might 
drop the baby.
 
 Standing on a balcony, you have an impulse to jump.
 
 You hear someone coughing and you think you might get sick and die.
 
 You feel like taking all of your clothes off.
 
 You find a certain minister very attractive, so you must be a sinner.
Those thoughts can be pretty uncomfortable. But if you don’t have OCD, you 
may dismiss them as odd or a bit disgusting. However, people with OCD mis-
interpret their thoughts as overly important or dangerous. They try to stop 
thinking the thoughts or do something to prevent the thoughts from occurring.
Various types of OCD thinking often work in concert with each other. Thus, 
most obsessions or compulsions involve more than one type of distorted 
thoughts. The story of Diane shows you how this collusion works.
Diane believes that in order to protect her children, she must repeat 
the number 3 all day long in her mind and do everything in sets of three. 
Thus, she washes the dishes three times and she flushes the toilets three 
times. As you can imagine, Diane has trouble getting things done.
Diane’s story illustrates how many types of OCD thinking gang up to ruin 
her life. Although her obsessions and compulsions all revolve around the 
number 3, you can see how these thought distortions overlap. Diane’s thinking 
includes:
 
 Being too responsible
 
 Controlling thoughts
 
 Exaggerating risk
 
 Thinking magically and illogically
 
 Viewing thoughts as real
But all is not lost for Diane or for you. We show you how to untangle OCD 
thinking in Chapters 8 and 9.
The next sections explain the most common OCD thinking errors. In Chap-
ters 8 and 9, we spell out how to combat OCD thinking.

78
Part I: The Ins and Outs of OCD 
Exaggerating risk
People with OCD tend to believe that bad things happen all the time, and that 
bad things have horrible consequences. For example, no one likes to be around 
people who are coughing and sneezing and not covering their mouths. Have 
you ever been on an airplane seated next to someone with a bad cold? Yuck. 
OCD turns that unpleasant feeling into panic about getting sick. The OCD mind 
imagines that catching the cold will result in bronchitis, pneumonia, or even 
death. OCD thinking exaggerates the likelihood of catching something as well 
as the consequences of getting ill.
The thinking of those with OCD tends to rate the likelihood of almost all 
types of obsessional fears actually occurring as much higher than logic 
would dictate. For example, a woman with scrupulosity OCD (see Chapters 2 
and 14 for more information) has obsessions about screaming out profanities 
in church. She worries about doing so at each and every service. In actuality, 
she has never in her life even said an obscenity out loud in front of anyone. 
But when asked by her therapist, she rates the likelihood that someday she’ll 
lose control in church at around 80 percent.
Not accepting uncertainty
Life does not come with guarantees. But those who suffer from OCD attempt 
to eliminate uncertainty of all kinds. Unfortunately, this creates greater 
misery than you might imagine. The following example of Ed shows how 
intolerance of uncertainty becomes a never-ending, nerve-wracking quest.
Ed suffers from a type of OCD in which he greatly fears that he is a 
pedophile, one who sexually abuses children (see Chapters 2 and 14 for 
more information). He has never abused a child, and he really doesn’t 
have sexual desires for children. However, he worries constantly about 
the possibility, no matter how remote, that he might one day actually 
attack a child sexually. His relatives are puzzled as to why he never 
attends their gatherings — but that’s because children attend those 
events. He spends hours each day reading about pedophiles to assure 
himself that he isn’t like them. This reading reduces his worries for a 
little while, but the uncertainty always returns. He believes that he must 
stay away from children at all costs — at least until he’s finally able to 
achieve 100 percent certainty that he is not a pedophile.
Ed’s story shows how desperately those with OCD crave certainty. 
Unfortunately, living without some degree of uncertainty is impossible.

79
 Chapter 5: Developing and Reinforcing OCD
Needing everything perfect
OCD thinking drives its sufferers to seek perfection. Perfectionists 
believe that perfection is actually possible and they should strive for it. 
Perfectionistic thinking dictates that everything should be arranged “just so” 
and completed without errors. This thinking often prevents people with OCD 
from finishing important work due to fear of making mistakes. Even miniscule 
mistakes are viewed with loathing and fear — if errors do occur, this thinking 
greatly magnifies their significance. You can probably see why perfectionism 
leads to avoidance and procrastination.
Controlling thoughts
Typically, people don’t spend a whole lot of time thinking about their think-
ing. Once in a while, a strange or disturbing thought may pop into people’s 
minds and they usually dismiss the odd thought as unimportant. For exam-
ple, Melinda may have the thought that she could let her car drift into an 
oncoming lane of traffic. But she quickly realizes that the thought is pretty 
silly and lets it go. Her attention returns to driving and listening to the radio.
However, those with OCD believe that thoughts are very important. They 
believe they should exert mental control by not allowing disturbing thoughts 
to occur in the first place. They think that controlling one’s thoughts is both 
possible and essential. If Sam, who has OCD, has a thought about driving into 
an oncoming lane of traffic, he believes that having that thought is a sign of 
poor mental health or even insanity. Ironically, Sam finds himself focusing on 
his fearful thought for a long time.
Being too responsible
Those with OCD believe that they must be vigilant and do everything pos-
sible to protect others from harm. And if a bad outcome does occur, they 
think they probably could and should have done something to prevent it. 
Sometimes this thinking gets pretty bent out of shape. The story of Ellen 
demonstrates this inflated sense of responsibility run amok.
Ellen believes that she must never fall ill out of concern for making 
others around her sick. She wears a face mask throughout the cold 
season and washes her hands every hour. She believes that her compul-
sions protect those around her from contracting any germs — which 
she feels she carries even if she isn’t sick. If one of her family members 
catches a cold, she obsesses over what she did to cause the illness. She 
firmly believes that there must have been something she could have 
done to prevent the cold.

80
Part I: The Ins and Outs of OCD 
Like many who have OCD, Ellen starts with an idea that sounds almost reason-
able — she wants to avoid making others sick. But the OCD throws the sense of 
responsibility into hyper-drive. She enormously inflates the extent to which she 
influences events and blames herself for things she has little or no control over.
Viewing thoughts as real
The OCD mind tends to view thoughts way too seriously — so much so that 
it blurs the distinction between thoughts and actions. This distinction can be 
blurred in three ways:
 
 Bad thoughts = bad deeds. This way of blurring thoughts and actions 
involves thinking that having a bad thought is the same thing as actually 
carrying out a bad deed. Thus, someone who has a thought of robbing a 
bank may conclude that he is as immoral as if he’d actually robbed the 
bank.
 
 Thoughts are always true. For example, if someone with OCD has a 
thought that the wallpaper is contaminated, she concludes that it must 
actually be contaminated.
 
 Thoughts cause events. Another way of thinking about thoughts as real 
is by making the assumption that thoughts can actually cause events in 
the world to occur. Thus, some people with OCD think that if they expe-
rience a thought about a loved one dying, the thought itself may cause 
the person to die.
Thinking magically and illogically
OCD thinking usually has a magical, illogical quality to it. Thus, those with 
OCD often imbue numbers with magical properties. For example, some num-
bers are thought to be either safe or dangerous, good or bad. Some with OCD 
feel a compulsion to repeat actions a certain number of times in order to pre-
vent a catastrophe from occurring.
Superstitions lack logic as well. In OCD, superstitions can look particularly 
bizarre. For example, someone with superstitious OCD (see Chapters 2 and 
17 for more information) may feel driven to wear certain colors in order to 
feel safe from harm. Someone else may avoid driving on streets that start 
with the letter C out of a conviction that C is an unlucky letter.
 
Lots of people have a few superstitious beliefs and even a little magical 
thinking — especially kids. It’s not OCD thinking until the beliefs start 
interfering with a person’s life. So if you don’t like the number 13 or the 
color black, so what? But if you spend hours each day consumed with 
thoughts about numbers and colors, you may have a problem.

Treatment Path

In this part . . .

n this part, we cover the issues you need to know 
before starting treatment for OCD. Many people with 
OCD never get help due to fears about treatment. We 
show you ways to overcome these fears. We also help you 
understand who is qualified to provide OCD treatment 
and how to know whether you’ve found the right person 
for you.

Chapter 6
Overcoming OCD Obstacles 
to Change
In This Chapter
 Understanding resistance to change
 Figuring out why people defeat themselves
 Running through the roadblocks
T
he process of change often stirs up a deep-seated, almost primal fear. 
Change for anyone can be uncomfortable. Fear of change leads many 
people to choose to live with the devil they know rather than the one they 
don’t. Other times people say and believe that they want to change, but they 
end up engaging in self-defeating behaviors without even knowing why.
The nature of OCD makes change even more challenging for those in its throes, 
and resistance is more multifaceted. In this chapter, we help you understand 
the nature and frequency of resisting effective treatment for OCD. We lay out 
how people defeat themselves before they even start. Then we discuss why 
engaging in such resistance is so understandable. Most importantly, we show 
you what can be done to turn from self-defeat to self-success.
Realizing Resistance is Futile
People who are trying to overcome OCD rarely succeed without first putting 
up a really good fight — against themselves. As odd as it may seem, their first 
instinct is often to resist necessary change and remain stuck exactly where 
they are.
Does this mean that people want to hold onto their problems such as OCD? 
We don’t think that’s the case. Nobody prefers to have OCD. Why would 
they? OCD consumes large chunks of time, causes distress, and creates 
misery for those affected.

84
Part II: Starting Down the Treatment Path 
People resist and avoid treatment of their OCD for various reasons. These 
roadblocks to change fall into three major categories:
 
 Specific fears and myths about OCD treatment
 
 Self-handicapping and fear of shame
 
 Self-beliefs that make change seem out of reach
We discuss each of these three change-blockers and provide a few hints for 
dealing with them as we go.
Fearing treatment
Most people don’t understand mental-health issues particularly well. Because 
OCD comes in highly varied forms (see Chapters 2 and 3 for information 
about the types of OCD and its relatives), it is even less understood than 
other mental-health problems, such as depression or anxiety. And lack of 
knowledge provides fertile ground for fears and myths to grow like weeds.
In the following sections, we discuss some of the most common fears and 
myths sufferers experience related to OCD and its treatment. Often, they’re 
the reasons people stop seeking treatment.
Going crazy
Some people are afraid that not being allowed to perform the compulsions 
that define their disorder may literally drive them crazy. This fear stems from 
the fact that compulsions often feel absolutely necessary to the person who 
performs them. OCD sufferers have described the desire to act on a compul-
sion as being as strong as the need to breathe.
The distress that OCD brings is very frightening, and carrying out compul-
sions provides a temporary sense of reduction in anxiety or distress. Thus, it 
feels better to:
 
 Arrange items perfectly in the closet for someone with symmetry concerns
 
 Check the locks 25 times for someone with checking and doubting worries
 
 Stop the car to check whether someone has been hit for someone with 
Hit-and-Run OCD
 
 Wash hands repeatedly for someone with contamination worries
We’ve never seen or heard of anyone going crazy by not carrying out a com-
pulsion, but it’s an understandable and legitimate fear nonetheless. Getting 
over this fear means learning to trust in the advice you’re given and slowly 
acting on that trust.

85
 Chapter 6: Overcoming OCD Obstacles to Change
Resisting risk
People with OCD hate nothing more than uncertainty and risk. Many OCD 
thoughts and behaviors are specifically designed to insulate against risk of 
any kind. And the OCD mind continuously conjures up all kinds of possible 
dangers and potential disasters.
That’s why some people with OCD check things over and over again — just to 
be sure. Some repeatedly wash their hands to be absolutely certain of elimi-
nating all germs. Still others engage in various rituals designed to protect the 
ones they love — all in the name of reducing risk.
 
Life comes with a degree of uncertainty, and when all is said and done, noth-
ing can truly eliminate it. Review Chapters 8 and 9 for ideas on coping with 
risk.
ERP for OCD
Estimates vary widely, but it appears that at 
least 25 to 50 percent of people who are offered 
treatment for their OCD either refuse treatment 
entirely, drop out early, or fail to comply with 
treatment fully. Although many people refuse 
treatments such as medication, refusal may 
also come in relation to a specific type of treat-
ment. This is particularly common with what’s 
known as exposure and response prevention 
(ERP) treatment (see Chapter 10 for more infor-
mation about ERP). This refusal is quite unfor-
tunate because ERP may be the most effective 
treatment currently available for OCD.
Briefly, ERP involves asking people to expose 
themselves to the very things that tend to trigger 
their obsessions and compulsions. While doing 
so, they must work very hard to resist engaging 
in the compulsions that they feel desperate to 
perform. For example, people with fears of con-
tamination may be asked to touch doorknobs, 
dirt, and motor oil while their therapists instruct 
them to avoid washing their hands for a period 
of time. As you may imagine, ERP is not an espe-
cially easy or comfortable procedure, especially 
if you have OCD. So it isn’t surprising that many 
people who might benefit from ERP refuse to 
carry it out.
Although ERP may be the most effective treat-
ment for OCD, the edge it holds over other 
approaches is modest. Alternatives do exist 
that are quite effective and that may arouse less 
fear (see especially Chapters 8, 9, and 11 for 
information on Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy, 
mindfulness, and medications).
Treatments for OCD work (see Chapters 8 
through 18 for lots of information about the 
types of treatment for OCD and its subtypes). In 
fact, they work pretty well — especially when 
people can be persuaded to stick with their 
treatment.

86
Part II: Starting Down the Treatment Path 
Being wary of inconsistency
Psychologists have known for a long time that people try to remain largely 
consistent in the behaviors, beliefs, and attitudes they exhibit. Being consis-
tent simplifies life and makes everything feel a little more predictable. You 
may not like your OCD thoughts or behaviors, but at least they’re familiar 
and predictable. Fear of inconsistency and the discomfort that accompanies 
breaking old routines and replacing them with new ones may keep you from 
following through on treatment that demands change.
 
At first, shaking old habits creates an uncomfortable shift from what you’ve 
come to know. Embracing new patterns of thoughts isn’t easy, but sticking 
with the treatment is crucial for success. With time and practice, you and your 
world will settle into a new consistency. Life will seem no less predictable than 
before treatment if you have a little patience.
Missing OCD
People with OCD come to believe that their thoughts or behaviors keep bad 
things from happening. Because they’ve become so accustomed to using 
compulsions to manage their obsessions, they often worry that eliminating 
their OCD will leave them without any tools for coping with distress.
 
If you have this concern, remind yourself that out of all the patients we’ve 
successfully treated for OCD, no one has ever begged to have their OCD back! 
We suspect such an outcome would be very rare, but if you were indeed to 
discover yourself missing your OCD, you could always go back to it if you 
wanted to (which you won’t).
Getting sick or worse
People starting OCD treatment worry that they might really get sick and die 
if they move ahead with treatment. For example, those who consider trying 
ERP treatment (see the previous sidebar and Chapter 10), frequently fear that 
exposure of certain types may result in death. Someone with contamination 
concerns is almost certain to greatly fear exposure to dirt and surfaces that 
other people have touched.
The risk of getting sick cannot be 100 percent eliminated. That’s because 
a very small degree of risk does indeed exist with exposure treatment. It’s 
conceivable, though exquisitely unlikely, that you could pick up a virus, get 
sick, and even die from touching a doorknob. Mind you, we’ve never heard 
of anyone undergoing ERP and dying in this manner, but anything is possible. 
Part of overcoming OCD involves finding ways to overcome the exaggerated 
fears of uncertainty and risk that accompany it. These fears can be overcome 
by taking a slow, gradual approach — but you can never fully eliminate risk.

87
 Chapter 6: Overcoming OCD Obstacles to Change
Hurting someone else
People with a type of OCD known as Doubting and Checking OCD sometimes 
fear hurting others. They develop elaborate ways of ensuring that they won’t 
carry out these feared acts, especially against a loved one. They truly fear 
that terrible things will happen if they don’t listen to what their OCD tells 
them to do. Parents often have fears of hurting their children. The following 
story about Valerie shows how one mother resists treatment for her OCD due 
to fear that her obsessional worries may come true.
Valerie, a mother with OCD, believes she needs to count each step she 
takes up to the number six, over and over, or her children will get seri-
ously injured. Throughout the day, she spends so much time counting 
that she can’t get the basic chores of everyday living completed. She 
loves her children and doesn’t want to chance hurting them. She feels 
terrified when a therapist tells her that in order to treat her problems she 
needs to stop counting. She worries that in spite of what the therapist 
says, there may be truth to her obsession and her kids might get hurt. No 
wonder following the therapist’s advice is so hard to do.
Valerie’s OCD controls her mind. She leaves therapy because of her 
intense fears. Her therapist may have pushed her a little too far too fast. 
However, six months later, she returns to therapy and works out a plan 
with her therapist to take a slower, more gradual approach.
Valerie’s story is not uncommon. Many OCD obsessions seem quite real to 
the person who has them. That’s what makes fighting them so difficult.
Another common OCD fear is the fear of losing control and hurting or abus-
ing someone as a result. Once again, this fear is exaggerated, as those with 
this type of OCD concern are actually at lower risk of harming others than 
most people. But in order to deal with this OCD-related fear, one must once 
again be willing to deal with a very small degree of uncertainty. Building up 
sufficient trust to work on this issue takes time.
Doing things against your will
People with OCD worry that their mental-health professional will make them 
do things that they don’t want to do. However, no competent, ethical thera-
pist will ever insist that you engage in anything that you say you simply 
cannot do. Therapists may try to help you see the advantages in following a 
treatment plan, but they will not force you to do so.
Being unable to stand the treatment
Some people are so afraid that the distress associated with OCD treatment 
may overwhelm them that they can’t even contemplate treatment. If you fear 
discomfort greatly, you may benefit from reading Chapter 8 to gear yourself 
up to seek treatment.

88
Part II: Starting Down the Treatment Path 
Thinking therapy doesn’t work
Some people have heard that therapy is ineffective, expensive, and takes an 
extraordinary amount of time to work. In reality, OCD treatments of various 
types do work, and they usually improve symptoms significantly in months 
rather than years (though treatment for complicated OCD and OCD along 
with other problems can take much longer).
The outcomes for Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy, mindfulness, ERP, and medi-
cation are reviewed in Chapters 8, 9, 10, and 11, respectively. These treat-
ments are considered very successful. Just one catch . . . you have to show 
up and participate actively in the treatments for them to work.
Handicapping against treatment success
Many of those with OCD fear working hard on their issues, so they engage in 
self-handicapping instead. What is self-handicapping? Essentially, it amounts 
to anything you do to limit yourself or your efforts in ways that provide an 
excuse for not making progress. It’s like engaging in a wrestling match with 
one arm tied behind your back. If you lose the match, you can always say, 
“But I had one arm tied behind my back!”
You may wonder why anyone would do this. The answer is actually quite 
simple: Self-handicapping avoids a loss of face and the resulting shame you 
might otherwise feel if you were to work very hard and still fail. It also allows 
you to save face if you succeed for a little while, but then fail later.
No one likes feeling ashamed. Yet those with OCD often feel ashamed of their 
symptoms and fear seeking treatment because they fear being judged nega-
tively. They think the therapist will see them as crazy; after all, some of the 
symptoms of OCD can look very strange indeed. But therapists are very good 
at being nonjudgmental. They don’t see you as a defective human being just 
because of your OCD. On the contrary, they know that OCD is a complicated 
problem and almost everyone engages in behavior that’s a little OCD-like 
from time to time.
So what does self-handicapping look like? It comes in a fascinating array of 
colors, shapes, and sizes. In the following sections, we discuss some of the 
ways people self-handicap their efforts. Head to the later section “Seeing that 
Resistance Can Be Overcome and Change Is Good” to find out how you can 
recognize and deal with your own self-handicapping behaviors.

89
 Chapter 6: Overcoming OCD Obstacles to Change
Waiting until you’re “ready”
By delaying therapy until you feel really ready, you avoid failure by never 
really starting. In other words, you’re waiting for the perfect time. The prob-
lem, of course, is that the perfect time doesn’t exist — except for the time 
you actually begin therapy.
Reducing effort
If you don’t try very hard, you’re giving yourself a built-in excuse for failure: 
“Well, I would have done rather well if I had actually made the effort.” 
Missing sessions and showing up late can be ways of reducing effort. This 
self-handicapping strategy fits the earlier example of tying one hand behind 
your back while wrestling.
Raising the bar
Sometimes people self-handicap by declaring that they can only succeed if 
they’re 100 percent perfect in their attempts to change. Anything less is unac-
ceptable. Thus, attaining a 65 percent reduction in OCD symptoms does not 
represent success. Although this strategy avoids declaring success, it indi-
rectly avoids failure. People who raise the bar in this way know that failing to 
achieve perfection isn’t really failing because no one can be perfect anyway.
Giving up early
Some folks will make a run at improving their lot, but abandon the effort pre-
maturely. Thus, they may try a few sessions of therapy, but quit well before 
treatment has had a chance to succeed. At the first moment that therapy gets 
difficult or feels scary, they jump ship. That’s because doing so avoids the 
chance of failure.
Seeing yourself as hopeless
If you’re already hopeless, it’s pretty hard to fail, isn’t it? Hopelessness is 
a little like the “reducing effort” form of self-handicapping, but taken to the 
extreme. If you’re hopeless, why even bother to try?
Blaming others
One way to limit yourself is to totally blame others for your problems. If 
you blame your parents, your therapist, or even your friends for not doing 
enough for you, then you don’t have to put forth your own efforts to change. 
If you don’t make an effort, you effectively prevent failure (unfortunately, you 
prevent success as well).

90
Part II: Starting Down the Treatment Path 
Reporting symptoms dishonestly
Sometimes those with OCD feel such shame about their symptoms that they 
lie or fail to tell their therapists the nature of their problems. In fact, we 
believe that OCD is an underreported epidemic because so many people are 
intensely embarrassed and ashamed of their symptoms.
Criticizing yourself harshly
Harsh self-criticism robs you of motivation and thus reduces your ability to 
keep putting forth effort. People engage in harsh criticism because they 
think that by doing so they’ll beat everyone else to the punch. But like all 
self-handicapping strategies, it simply prevents success.
Arguing with the therapist
One way people avoid dealing with their problems is by going into therapy 
and then constantly disagreeing with the therapist. Thus, the focus of the 
discussion is about how wrong the therapist is rather than on the work that’s 
necessary in order to get better. Others avoid working by questioning the 
competence or skills of the therapist or dismissing therapy as nonsense.
Although arguing for the purpose of avoiding treatment is never a good idea, 
there are times when disagreeing with a therapist is actually very appropriate. 
Some practitioners are not well-trained or may not be a good match for you. If 
this is true in your case, you need to change therapists. See Chapter 7 for more 
information about getting professional help and knowing whether you’ve found 
a good match.
Passive acceptance
While arguing excessively with your therapist isn’t a good idea, passive 
acceptance isn’t good either. Some people enter therapy and sit quietly wait-
ing for the therapist to change them. That doesn’t work. Getting better takes 
active involvement and cooperation.
Presenting distractions
Most people with OCD find it difficult to talk about their symptoms. A 
common way to avoid dealing with difficult subjects is through distraction. 
Clients want to talk about another problem at work or a difficult relationship. 
Sometimes their pressing concerns are really just ways of staying away from 
doing the hard work of therapy.
Waiting for the guarantee
Some people with OCD want an absolute guarantee that if they’re going to 
make the effort to try a difficult treatment like ERP, it will work. Of course, no 
such guarantee is possible. The outcome data is highly promising, but no one 
can provide absolute assurance that it will work.

91
 Chapter 6: Overcoming OCD Obstacles to Change
Denying improvement
Another way to self-handicap and avoid failure is to deny success. We’ve seen 
clients improve a great deal on a wide variety of indicators of their OCD sever-
ity. Yet they insist that they’re doing no better. Denying improvement provides 
a buffer — just in case things take a turn for the worse. However, denying real 
improvements when they occur can also rob you of the motivation needed for 
continuing with difficult treatments.
Putting too much blame on biology
In Chapter 4, we point out that the brain is heavily involved in OCD. Problems 
with the way the brain functions clearly contribute to the development of the 
disorder. But other factors also enter in. And as we discuss in Chapter 4, when 
you change your thinking and your behavior, studies have shown you can liter-
ally affect the way your brain functions, for the better. But if you completely 
chalk up your OCD to a brain disease, you may be less willing to engage in 
some of these other effective, albeit a little challenging, strategies. You prob-
ably just want to take medication. Although medicines do play a role in treating 
OCD, you can limit your success by not considering the alternatives.
Believing the worst about yourself
All people hold certain beliefs about themselves. Some of these beliefs are 
positive, while others may hold you back. Negative beliefs — seeing yourself 
as inadequate, dependent, undeserving, and/or blameworthy, for example — 
can have a very negative impact on your ability to deal with your OCD. The 
following sections explain the most common types of self-beliefs that can get 
in the way of dealing with your OCD.
Believing you are inadequate
OCD can make people lose confidence in their ability to handle the everyday 
stresses in the world. No wonder many who suffer from OCD start to feel that 
they can’t solve their problems. Feelings of inadequacy go hand in hand with 
OCD. The belief that you can’t do something (like change or get better) stops 
you from trying.
Inadequacy often leads to dependency. Because people with OCD feel 
that they’re inadequate, they often seek some outside help. They often 
become dependent on friends or partners, asking for frequent reassurance. 
Unfortunately, getting reassurance may give temporary relief, but doubt 
quickly returns (see Chapter 5 for more on the dangers of reassurance).

92
Part II: Starting Down the Treatment Path 
Believing you are guilty
Some people with OCD believe they’re 100 percent to blame for having the 
disorder. Feeling guilty about something takes a lot of mental energy. If 
people with OCD feel guilty, they may also feel that somehow they deserve to 
suffer, and therefore they deserve the pain of OCD.
Guilt is focused on the past. In order to get better, you need to move past 
the guilt and go forward. If you feel guilty and ashamed about having OCD, 
ponder these questions:
 
 Do I remember ever having wanted to get OCD?
 
 Does feeling guilty about my OCD help me get better?
 
 If I had friends with OCD, would I tell them they were to blame for having it?
 
 Is it possible that if I stop feeling guilty about having OCD, I might actually 
have more energy to devote toward recovery?
 
 Is it possible that my OCD is largely a result of genetics, my early 
development, and other experiences (such as stress and trauma) I 
encountered over the years?
Use your answers to these questions to help you find self-acceptance. Once 
you can accept yourself where you are right now, you will find it much easier 
to move forward.
Believing you are undeserving
Those who believe that they’re undeserving don’t feel that they’re worthy of 
getting better. Typically, they received those messages in childhood. They 
feel uncomfortable when others are kind to them. They often wallow in their 
own misery sincerely convinced that happiness is meant for others, and that 
they don’t deserve the relief that treatment can bring.
Friends and family may find that those who feel undeserving can be rather 
frustrating because they resist help. Such friends and family may want to 
read Chapter 22 for ideas about how to help without making themselves 
miserable in the process.
Believing you are a victim
As discussed in Chapter 5, OCD is sometimes triggered or worsened by trau-
matic events. When terrible things happen to people, their views of the world 
and themselves change. More often than not, they shift from viewing them-
selves as independent, competent, and capable to dependent, incompetent, 
and incapable. This is a completely natural and understandable reaction to 
the horrible event. Victims often focus on unfairness and injustice. They feel 
angry about what’s happened, but fail to see their responsibility for taking 
positive action in order to recover. Victims tend to believe that their fate and 
emotional well-being are largely controlled by outside forces.

93
 Chapter 6: Overcoming OCD Obstacles to Change
At the same time, some who suffer from OCD unrelated to trauma also feel 
like victims — of their OCD. Their reactions are also understandable because 
OCD is a terrible affliction. However, in order to progress, victims must 
learn to let go of these views of themselves and shift to the perspective of 
those who’ve found ways to cope. Those who cope have also had something 
bad happen to them, but they’ve managed to focus on what they can do to 
recover. Theirs is a more active, involved stance.
Seeing that Resistance Can Be 
Overcome and Change Is Good
The preceding sections help you understand that resistance to treatment 
is both common and understandable. At the same time, fighting or refusing 
treatment doesn’t help you overcome OCD. Realizing that you did nothing to 
ask for your OCD is important. And as much as you may resist treatment, you 
probably hate having OCD just as much.
The way out of this mess is to stop blaming yourself and stop seeing yourself 
as a victim. You just need to take responsibility for doing something about 
your problem.
Embracing the process of change
Change of almost any type frequently requires multiple attempts. 
Psychologists and researchers, Drs. James Prochaska, John Norcross, and 
Carlo DiClemente have studied the process of change and discovered that it 
typically involves six phases — whether you’re talking about OCD, stopping 
smoking, losing weight, or overcoming depression. Understanding these 
phases and how they work can help you stay on the right path. The phases are
 
1. Precontemplation: In this phase, people haven’t even started to ponder 
doing anything about their problem. Sometimes in this stage people 
deny that they have a problem at all. The good news here is that if you 
have OCD and you’re reading this book, you’ve no doubt moved past 
this stage.
 
2. Contemplation: This phase is where people start giving serious thought 
to doing something about their problem. Sometimes they feel that their 
problem is a little overwhelming, so they remain on the sidelines for a 
while until they can see a light at the end of the tunnel that doesn’t look 
like an oncoming train. This chapter is designed to help you with this 
phase.

94
Part II: Starting Down the Treatment Path 
 
3. Preparation: At this point, people usually feel there is something they 
can do to get better. So they design a plan for how they can attack their 
problem. Chapters 8, 9, 10, and 11 help you with ideas for this stage and 
the next one — taking action.
 
4. Action: This is where the rubber meets the road. In this phase, people 
carry out the plan that they’ve designed.
 
5. Maintenance: This phase is one that people often don’t think about 
ahead of time. It’s when you’ve gotten better, but then discover that 
maintaining those gains requires a little more effort than you thought 
it would. You, however, will be ready because we prepare you for this 
phase beforehand. We give you lots of information about avoiding 
relapse and maintaining your gains in Chapter 12.
 
6. Termination: Some people manage to reach a phase where their change 
is so complete and ingrained that they no longer have to put much 
effort into holding onto their gains. Not everyone reaches this phase, 
and it isn’t realistic for most of those who have OCD to expect a virtu-
ally complete cure with no further effort required. However, people with 
OCD can improve greatly and, with continued maintenance strategies, 
manage to live very fulfilling lives that are far less weighed down with 
OCD than when they had not yet contemplated change.
You may think that these phases occur sequentially, one through six. And 
sometimes they do. However, it’s more common to jump around these stages 
a number of times. For example, some people leap into action without having 
made much of a plan. Then when the action fails, they bounce back to the 
precontemplation phase and don’t consider changing for a while.
Jenny’s story is a typical example of someone who vacillates from one phase 
of change to another. Though it takes her several years to successfully tackle 
her OCD, she eventually makes great strides.
Jenny, an X-ray technician working for a major hospital, suffers from 
Contamination OCD (see Chapter 2). Of course, hospitals stress the 
criticalness of clean hands, which makes things worse for Jenny. Her 
co-workers make comments about her compulsive hand-washing. At 
first, Jenny denies she has a problem and keeps her hands hidden from 
others by wearing gloves much of the day. However, her supervisor 
talks with her about the issue one day when he sees that Jenny’s hands 
are raw and oozing from her excessive washing.
At this point, Jenny is in the precontemplation stage. After her conversa-
tion with her supervisor, she moves to the preparation stage by entering 
treatment. She immediately starts ERP therapy and tries very hard to stay 
the course for five days. In Jenny’s case, she still must wash her hands 
more than most people due to her hospital- and patient-related work. 
However, she no longer washes for an hour each morning and evening.

95
 Chapter 6: Overcoming OCD Obstacles to Change
Unfortunately, after five days, Jenny’s OCD overwhelms her and she gives 
up — returning once again to the precontemplation phase. Jenny’s super-
visor recommends that Jenny try a different treatment approach that 
may feel less intense and threatening. He even suggests that she read 
Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder For Dummies before she starts treatment 
so she can take her time and carefully contemplate what changes and 
treatments she may want to try.
Jenny ultimately selects cognitive therapy (see Chapter 8) as something 
that sounds a little easier. She also talks to her physician about medi-
cation (see Chapter 11). A few months later, Jenny’s symptoms have 
improved greatly. At this point, she’s in the maintenance phase.
A year later, she experiences a relapse and her symptoms return full- 
blown. She needs to regroup and moves into the contemplation phase. 
Finally, she selects mindfulness (see Chapter 9) and a little ERP (see 
Chapter 10). These strategies work very well for her. In the ensuing four 
years, she experiences minimal trouble with her OCD, although she 
needs to remain vigilant and continues in the maintenance phase.
Jenny’s story shows you that change isn’t always smooth, even, and easy. 
Most people make progress and have slip-ups. But each time Jenny struggled, 
she gained something from the process.
 
People who succeed at improving their OCD (or anything else) take a number 
of runs at their problems. Just because you’ve made a few attempts only to 
slide back does not mean that you won’t ultimately succeed. The fact is, each 
time you make a solid attempt, you discover things that will help you in your 
next go-round.
Defeating self-handicapping
Self-handicapping occurs whenever you do anything that interferes with making 
progress. People with OCD are especially vulnerable to the self-handicapping 
trap because the treatments can be so challenging. If you have OCD and are 
starting treatment, we suggest that you monitor your own behavior for any 
signs of self-handicapping. When you see the self-handicapping occurring, try to 
respond to it by recognizing how self-defeating this behavior can be. Talk back 
to the self-handicapping part of your OCD mind.
In the example below, Art had started treatment for his OCD six weeks earlier 
and had been struggling to get on track. Art’s story shows how self-handicapping 
can interfere with treatment until you start attacking it.

96
Part II: Starting Down the Treatment Path 
Art suffers from what’s sometimes called Hit-and-Run OCD (see Chapters 
2 and 13 for more information). Whenever he drives, it isn’t long before 
he feels some type of bump in the road — usually from a pothole, running 
over a speed bump, an out-of-balance tire, or going over a rock. When 
he feels the bump, he instantly imagines that he’s run over a person. 
His body floods with adrenaline and fear as his heart races and his shirt 
becomes soaked with sweat.
He pulls over to the side of the road and looks back. At that moment, 
he’s quite certain that he will find a body. He never does. Sometimes Art 
inspects his car looking for signs of blood or dents from the impact. He 
also returns to the scene multiple times just to be sure that nothing has 
happened. Needless to say, it takes Art an awfully long time to get where 
he’s going.
At his wife’s insistence, Art seeks therapy for his problem. Art encounters 
a lot of difficulty getting started with his treatment. Therefore, his thera-
pist suggests that he monitor his self-handicapping, recognize it for what 
it is, and respond to it. Table 6-1 shows what Art came up with.

Monday
I didn’t read the material 
my psychologist 
suggested.
When I don’t do these things, I’m 
handicapping myself. OK, this 
reading will take 15 minutes; I’m 
not going to let my OCD mind 
defeat me!
Tuesday
I was 20 minutes late for 
my appointment.
Sure, I was busy, but in truth, I 
think I was self-handicapping 
again. At least I caught you in 
action, OCD mind.
Wednesday
Today, I stopped my car 
and looked for a body on 
the road. My therapist has 
asked me to not do that. 
Maybe I’m hopeless.
I’m defeating myself again. I 
knew I didn’t have to cave in. But 
I also don’t have to see myself as 
hopeless. Next time, I’ll be on the 
lookout for this.
Thursday
I had a partial success 
today in that I resisted 
going back to the scene, 
but I did look into my 
rearview mirror. I must not 
be doing any of this right.
I am self-handicapping when I 
view actual progress as a failure. 
I need to pat myself on the back 
whenever I take a step in the 
right direction.

I had a thought that this 
treatment is too difficult. 
Why should I do all this 
when I’ve read that OCD 
is all biological anyway? 
Maybe I should just take 
some medication and be 
done with it.
My therapist talked with me 
about medication and he pointed 
out that it is an option, but this 
treatment will probably work 
better in the long run. I’m just 
handicapping myself when I see 
it as entirely biological.
Saturday
I’ve gone two days now 
without stopping my car. I 
understand this approach 
now, so I think I can quit 
therapy.
Wow, that’s a great way to 
snatch defeat from the jaws of 
victory. I have so many other 
issues, and I’m pretty sure there’s 
more to be done with my Hit-and-
Run OCD. I’m just kidding myself 
by thinking it’s gone just because 
I’ve done well for two days.
Sunday
Today I found myself 
getting really mad at my 
mother. She’s the cause 
of my OCD — what with 
the way she used to clean 
the house all the time and 
warn us constantly about 
every imaginable danger. 
When I learned to drive, all 
she would do is yell at me.
OK, perhaps she did contribute 
to my OCD. But if I focus only 
on blaming her, I won’t get any-
where myself. I need to let my 
anger go.
My Reflections: I can see that my OCD mind has lots of ways of handicapping my 
efforts. I’m going to have to be very vigilant and recognize when I’m starting to 
defeat myself. I can win this war, but only if I stay alert.
Art’s story illustrates how easy it is to self-handicap. When you start your 
treatment for OCD, be on the lookout for things like missing appointments, 
blaming others, not wanting to carry out assignments between sessions, and 
so on. We urge you to also track your self-handicapping on the “Monitoring 
Self-Handicapping” form, which you can find in Appendix B.
Here’s how to go about monitoring and responding to your self-handicapping 
tendencies:
 
1. In either a notebook or on a copy of the form from Appendix B, write 
down the date that you are monitoring your self-handicapping.

98
Part II: Starting Down the Treatment Path 
 
2. To the right of that, indicate what behaviors or thoughts you’ve had that 
indicate some type of self-handicapping.
 
3. Respond to your self-handicapping by talking back to that part of your OCD 
mind. Formulate a reason to not engage in that type of self-handicapping.
 
4. After you’ve recorded your self-handicapping for at least a week, write 
down what you’ve discovered from the exercise.
 
Although you don’t have to explicitly label your self-handicapping, you may 
find it useful to review the list of ways people engage in self-handicapping. 
Refer to the earlier section, “Handicapping against treatment success.”
Dismantling change-blocking beliefs
Recognizing that you may be holding onto negative beliefs about yourself 
(such as feeling guilty, inadequate, undeserving, or a victim) is the first step 
toward pushing them out of your way. The second step involves analyzing 
those beliefs in order to help you see how badly they interfere with your 
desire to change.
For that step, we recommend that you carry out a cost/benefit analysis. A 
cost/benefit analysis is a simple, but highly effective, technique. It helps you 
focus on the problem and develop a sensible alternative. Although most 
beliefs at least seem to confer a few benefits or advantages, close scrutiny 
usually reveals that those advantages are far outweighed by the costs.
Here’s an example of how Roberto carries out a cost/benefit analysis of his 
success-busting belief about himself:
Roberto is an engineer in his late twenties. Other than work, he lives a 
very solitary life. He has always felt different from others and avoided 
making friends because he assumes others won’t like him. Roberto suf-
fers from Hoarding OCD (see Chapter 16). He feels driven to collect an 
unimaginable array of useless junk. He has newspapers from the last 
several years. Junk mail, catalogs, rubber bands, paper clips, pencils, 
nuts, bolts, tools, wires, and nails overflow his garage and have overtaken 
many of his other living spaces. He stopped inviting anyone over months 
ago out of shame.
But he feels inadequate to the task of cleaning up his house. He can’t even 
seem to get any part of his collections organized. He feels overwhelmed 
by the task and incapable of making changes. However, Roberto contem-
plates taking a shot at his OCD. He realizes that his success-busting belief 
of inadequacy stands in his way. So he carries out a cost/benefit analysis 
of this belief, as shown in Table 6-2.

99
 Chapter 6: Overcoming OCD Obstacles to Change
Table 6-2  Cost/Benefit Analysis of Roberto’s Inadequacy Belief
Goal, problematic thought, belief, or decision: I believe I am inadequate.
Benefits
Costs
If I feel inadequate, I don’t 
have to work hard to make 
changes.
If I feel inadequate, I may not have to work at 
making changes, but I won’t make any changes!
Maybe I can get my mother 
to help me with this problem 
if I feel inadequate to do it 
myself.
Feeling inadequate invites my mother to keep 
controlling my life. She makes me feel even more 
stupid when she takes over.
I won’t have to tackle my 
problem and then fail.
If I continue feeling inadequate, I won’t make 
changes. And if I don’t do something, the fire 
department will be called.
By holding onto my belief in my inadequacy, I ruin 
any chance I’d ever have of meeting someone.
Believing in my inadequacy feels awful.
My Reflections: Now I can see how much my belief in inadequacy has been hurting 
me. I need to be on the lookout for that belief. This weekend, I vow to take two garbage 
bags’ worth of stuff out, and I’ll call that psychologist who specializes in OCD.
After Roberto reviews his cost/benefit analysis of his success-busting belief, 
he decides to act as if he were actually adequate. He realizes that staying 
stuck will enable his OCD to keep him down. He grabs the phone book and 
makes an appointment to see a psychologist (see Chapter 7 for ideas about 
finding professional help).
You can find a blank copy of the cost/benefit analysis form in Appendix B. 
Here’s how to design a cost/benefit analysis of your problematic beliefs:
 
1. Either in a notebook or in the form in Appendix B, write down a 
success-busting belief that you think applies to you.
 
2. Underneath the heading “Benefits,” write all the imaginable advantages 
or ways in which your belief feels useful to you.
 
3. Under “Costs,” write down all the ways that your belief may be holding 
you back, costing you, or causing you harm.
 
4. Beneath your table, write “My Reflections” and summarize what you’ve 
discovered from your cost/benefit analysis.
 
You can use a cost/benefit analysis to change a belief, make a decision, rethink 
your perspective, decide about goals, and motivate your efforts. It helps you 
move past contemplating changes and actually start moving forward.

100
Part II: Starting Down the Treatment Path 
If you discover that your cost/benefit analysis results in more benefits or 
advantages for retaining your core belief about yourself, you will likely 
benefit from professional help for continuing your work.
Taking one step at a time
You may think that you’re sick of your OCD and you want to change it and 
change it now. Great! But, be careful. Successful change requires careful 
contemplation, planning, and work. Thinking you can just jump right into 
eliminating your OCD sets you up to have unrealistic expectations. Those 
expectations can cause you to crash quite suddenly if and when your 
attempts falter.
We suggest a slow and steady strategy for tackling OCD. For example, if 
you’re trying ERP therapy (see Chapter 10) to help rid you of your fears of 
contamination, starting out by rubbing the inside of a dumpster with your 
hand probably isn’t a good idea. But you might be able to tackle touching a 
doorknob.
The same advice holds for how you approach this book. We hope the 380 
or so pages don’t overwhelm you. We want to be sure that almost anything 
anyone would want to know about OCD is covered in these pages. But you 
don’t have to read every single chapter, and you certainly don’t need to carry 
out every single exercise. Furthermore, you should take it at your own pace.
 
Resistance to change is not a good option. But taking reasonable risks and 
accepting occasional setbacks in your therapy are good options that can help 
keep you on track to overcoming OCD.

Chapter 7
Getting Help for OCD
In This Chapter
 Knowing the types of help available
 Collaborating with your mental-health professional
 Deciding whether you’ve made the right choice
M
any people who have obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) never 
seek help for their problem. Those who suffer often fail to get help 
because they feel ashamed of their obsessions and compulsions. Unlike the 
worries associated with anxiety or the sadness that comes with depres-
sion, the thoughts and behaviors of OCD can appear quite bizarre to others. 
People with OCD fear that their disorder will make them look crazy, so they 
work hard to hide their symptoms. But OCD can worsen over time if treat-
ment is not sought.
In this chapter, we tell you about the kinds of help available for treating OCD. 
If your symptoms are quite mild, you may want to select one of the various 
types of self-help for your OCD. However, most people with OCD benefit more 
if they also receive some type of professional help. In any case, educating 
yourself about OCD should be part of your treatment plan.
We introduce you to the cast of characters in the mental-health field. More 
importantly, we tell you how to find the right person and what to expect 
when you make an appointment. Finally, we help you evaluate whether your 
choice was a good one for you.
Going After the Types of Help You Need
If your brakes fail, you take your car in to a garage and let the mechanic do 
the repair job. If you have an ear infection, you go to a medical provider and 
get some antibiotics. You can pretty much leave the fixing to the experts. You 
have to cooperate — that is, pay the bill or take the pill — but little personal 
effort is required.

102
Par t II: Starting Down the Treatment Path 
Taking on OCD is different, however. When you fight OCD, you have to go 
into the boxing ring yourself and engage in the battle. You may have some-
one in your corner coaching you, but you’re the one who has to throw the 
punches and bob and weave to avoid getting hit.
If you or someone you care about has OCD, you probably wish the solution 
could be quick and easy. Unfortunately, there are no quick fixes for OCD. But 
don’t despair — highly effective treatments are available.
 
OCD can be severe and is sometimes accompanied by depression (see 
Chapter 3). If you have thoughts of hopelessness or suicidal thoughts, please 
seek immediate help from a health professional. Furthermore, if OCD is 
making it nearly impossible to get to work, sleep, eat, or get along with others, 
you should get professional help without delay.
Educating yourself about OCD
Self-help is a necessary part of any successful OCD treatment, and a huge 
chunk of that self-help is becoming educated about OCD causes and treat-
ments. You may seek professional help in addition to self-help for guidance, 
support, and motivation (see Chapter 6 on overcoming obstacles and resis-
tance to change), or you may be ready to jump-start treatment on your own. 
Either way, you need to actively participate in your treatment program, and 
self-help motivates you to do so.
You can help yourself in two ways — by finding out all you can about OCD 
and by getting support from family, friends, and others. In this section, we 
discuss the education aspect of self-help. (Skip ahead to the next section for 
more on enlisting support.)
Obtaining information about what you’re up against prepares you for the 
battle ahead. Prior to the Super Bowl, the coaches try to find out all they can 
about the opposing team so they’re prepared to make the right moves at the 
right time. In the same way, educating yourself about OCD can help you come 
up with a winning game plan. You can turn to any of the following sources for 
information about OCD:
 
 Audio CDs: You may find it helpful to use the time spent in your car 
driving to and from work to listen to audio CDs. If you can focus on the 
road at the same time, CDs can be a great way to learn about OCD. If 
you ride the subway, you can listen to audio books or podcasts on your 
portable media player. However, not everyone easily retains information 
this way. Last summer, for instance, we tried to learn Spanish while driv-
ing. It didn’t work very well. Qué lástima (what a pity).
 
 Books: We love books. Books are great for self-help, and, of course, we 
hope this book is especially useful. Books are fairly inexpensive, espe-
cially if you buy them used. Owning books about OCD is nice because you 

103
 Chapter 7: Get ting Help For OCD
can refer to them over and over again. If you enjoy reading, try to read 
more than one book about OCD. Repetition helps you retain information.
 
 Television and movies: Because entertainment is usually the purpose of 
television and movies, you have to be cautious about believing everything 
you see. However, as part of our preparation for this book, we watched the 
entire first four seasons of the television show Monk. We were impressed 
with the skill of the actor who played the main character, Tony Shalhoub, 
and his portrayal of OCD. We really enjoyed watching the show. Sitting in 
front of the TV is sure easier than writing books. You may also enjoy vari-
ous movies that portray characters who suffer from OCD, such as As Good 
as It Gets with Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt.
 
 Web sites: Nowadays, you can access virtually unlimited information on 
the Internet. But, be careful about what you find there. Both amateurs 
and professionals alike can offer advice, and it’s often hard to differenti-
ate between the two. Be even more cautious if you come across anyone 
trying to sell quick-fix services or products. A good place to start is with 
the OCD Foundation at www.ocfoundation.org.
 
See Appendix A for our other top selections of books and other media sources 
of good information about OCD.
 
Whether you choose books, CDs, or search the Web, check out the credentials 
of the author or publisher. Buyer beware — especially if the product promises 
quick and easy solutions.
Getting support from family, 
friends, and others
People with OCD are often isolated. Obsessions and compulsions take up 
time and energy. Many people with OCD can barely make it through the day, 
let alone have time to socialize. Yet, getting support can be an integral part of 
getting better. One OCD treatment in particular, exposure and response pre-
vention (ERP — see Chapter 10), may involve getting together with a buddy 
or partner to carry out some of the assignments. Social support can come in 
the form of:
 
 Friends and family: If you have an understanding family or friends, 
they may be willing to pitch in and help. First, they’ll need to become 
educated about the ins and outs of OCD — this book can be a great start 
for them. Once educated, they can serve as assistants to ERP. Typically, 
their assistance should be guided by a professional whom you are 
seeing for your OCD. Friends and family can also serve as gentle coaches 
giving you needed encouragement (see Chapter 22 for more information 
about the role played by family and friends).

104
Par t II: Starting Down the Treatment Path 
 
 Online support: Online chat rooms, forums, and other support groups 
related to OCD allow you to be anonymous, and many people benefit 
from sharing with others online. The good online groups abide by codes 
of conduct — offensive, inappropriate, and unrelated comments are 
discouraged. Some of these groups even have moderators who edit and 
delete prohibited messages. Other groups provide a specific community 
with related news, updates, and a chance to talk with others through 
e-mails only. A few groups even involve professionals who volunteer 
their time to the online community.
 
 Support groups: Groups for people with OCD can provide compassion-
ate support. Some groups involve a mental-health professional who 
leads the discussion, provides education, and offers suggestions. Other 
groups consist of people with OCD and function mainly as places to talk 
about experiences, solve problems, and offer empathy.
 
Be careful about who you share personal information with, and don’t buy into 
what anyone trying to sell you quick-cure products may tell you.
Choosing a professional to help you
Not every mental-health professional is well acquainted with OCD. That’s 
because at one time, OCD was thought to be extremely difficult to treat and 
quite rare. Now we know that these ideas are not true at all — OCD is both 
treatable and fairly common. The bottom line is that you need to ask your 
mental-health professional about his or her experience and training with 
OCD. A qualified person will have received training and education about OCD 
and treated OCD fairly frequently.
 
Anyone you choose should be familiar with the major therapeutic approaches 
to OCD, such as Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT), mindfulness, a specific 
type of CBT known as exposure and response prevention (ERP), and medica-
tions (see Chapters 8, 9, 10, and 11, respectively).
Picking the right professional
You may have to seek services from more than one professional. Although all 
of them should be familiar with the treatment approaches to OCD, not every-
one administers all the OCD treatments. For example, you could obtain ERP 
training from a psychologist and medication from a psychiatrist. Here are the 
types of professionals who sometimes work with OCD sufferers:
 
 Coaches: Coaches or life coaches are fairly new in the area of mental- 
health treatment. Some coaches have good skills (and are also trained 
counselors or psychologists). However, at this time no licensing require-
ments exist for this class of professionals. And coaching doesn’t have a 
lot of science backing it up. We think coaching can be great for setting 

105
 Chapter 7: Get ting Help For OCD
goals and increasing motivation in your personal or business life, but we 
recommend sticking to a licensed practitioner for OCD.
 
 Counselors: Counselors have graduate training in counseling, education, 
theology, or psychology. They obtain a master’s degree and are licensed 
to practice in their state of residence. The backgrounds of counselors 
vary widely and you need to check on the specific training of the coun-
selor that you choose. Many counselors are very well trained and have 
expertise in treating OCD.
 
 Psychiatrists: Psychiatrists attend medical school and obtain an MD 
degree. They follow the attainment of this degree with additional train-
ing in the diagnosis and treatment of emotional disorders. Psychiatrists 
are experts in prescribing medications for OCD. Most psychiatric prac-
tices emphasize biological treatments for emotional disorders and do 
not typically engage in psychotherapy treatments for OCD, such as ERP, 
mindfulness, and CBT.
 
 Psychoanalysts: A psychoanalyst usually starts out as a psychiatrist, 
psychologist, or other therapist and gets additional training. This 
approach looks at deep-seated childhood issues. Treatment usually 
requires several sessions a week for many years and no research that 
we know of has been conducted on its use with OCD. Effective OCD 
treatment targets symptoms directly and usually brings at least some 
relief within a few months or less. Psychoanalysis is not a good fit for 
someone with OCD.
 
 Psychologists: This group of professionals is most likely to have extensive 
training in the various psychotherapies specific to OCD. Psychologists 
have doctoral degrees (PhD or PsyD) in psychology and are licensed by 
the state in which they practice. The psychotherapies they deliver have 
been scientifically proven to be effective. Although most psychologists 
do not prescribe medication for OCD, a few states now allow prescription 
privileges for psychologists who obtain additional training in that area.
 
 Social workers: Social workers attend graduate school and obtain a 
master’s degree in social work. Many social workers also obtain supervi-
sion and training in psychotherapy, including techniques for treating 
OCD. They are licensed by the state in which they practice. Social work-
ers also have training and expertise in case management and helping 
people obtain needed social or governmental services.
You may hear the word therapist or psychotherapist used to describe a 
mental-health professional. “Therapist” is a general word used to describe 
someone who does therapy. Sometimes the word “psychotherapist” is used 
to describe a person who does psychotherapy. A therapist may be a social 
worker, counselor, or psychologist.

Par t II: Starting Down the Treatment Path 
Avoiding the wrong pseudo-professional
 
Lots of people hang shingles on their door proclaiming their expertise in various 
healing arts. They provide a range of services, such as chiropractic healing, mas-
sage, and acupuncture. A few of these approaches work for pain or other disor-
ders, but they have not demonstrated effectiveness for OCD.
In addition, some individuals have strings of letters after their names (desig-
nating something, but we have no idea what) and may not have a license to 
practice anything. They may advertise services such as:
 
 Ear candling
 
 Exposure to low-level magnetic fields
 
 Listening to special sounds while lying on a vibrating table
 
 Past-life regression
We live in New Mexico — trust us, we see lots of interesting alternative 
health practices. By the way, we heard of one guy who listed CCG after his 
name. What the heck is that, we asked? Certified Crystal Gazer.
Asking the important questions
When you decide to call the office of a professional, there are some things 
you’ll probably want to know before making your first appointment. Some of 
these questions can be answered by the office manager or secretary, if there 
is one. These questions include:
 
 How soon can I be seen? If the answer is in several months, you may 
want to keep checking around.
 
 What are the fees, and do you take my insurance plan? Not all prac-
titioners accept all insurance plans, and some do not accept any. You 
need to know the fee schedule upfront.
 
 What are your practice hours? If you require evening or weekend 
appointments, you need to see whether these are available.
 
 Does this person hold a license to practice in this state? If not, we rec-
ommend you seek services elsewhere. You can verify this information 
on the Internet in most cases.
 
With all the complex ins and outs of insurance these days, we strongly advise 
you to call your health insurance plan; that is, assuming you can get through 
to a real, live person! Ask about how many sessions your policy allows, how 
frequently those sessions can occur, and at what rate your policy will reim-
burse for OCD treatment. If your provider does not accept insurance, inquire 
as to whether your insurance carrier will consider reimbursing you for ses-
sions with a receipt from the provider.

107
 Chapter 7: Get ting Help For OCD
 
You may also want to consider the convenience of the professional’s office in 
relation to where you live. However, convenience is relatively less important 
than the person’s experience and skill in working with OCD.
You’ll want to ask the mental-health professional a few questions directly. 
These only require about five or ten minutes of time, and most professionals 
will be willing to answer them on the phone prior to you making your first 
appointment. These questions include:
 
 Do you ever consider administering treatment outside of your office 
for OCD? Although most professionals do not conduct treatment out-
side of their offices for most problems, OCD treatment sometimes calls 
for flexibility.
 
 Do you teach your OCD clients how to administer ERP for themselves? 
A good therapist not only guides you through ERP, but also teaches you 
how to apply it for yourself. See Chapter 10 for information about ERP.
 
 Do you treat and/or evaluate OCD? Not everyone does, so be sure to 
ask. You may not know for sure whether you have OCD, but if you sus-
pect that you do, you need a good evaluation.
 
 Do you treat OCD regularly? You want to hear that the professional either 
regularly treats OCD or will get supervision from someone who does.
 
 Do you use scientifically validated therapies for OCD? You certainly 
want a treatment that has been proven effective in the treatment of OCD. 
The professional should mention at least one of the following therapies: 
CBT, ERP, mindfulness, or medications.
Billions of bucks couldn’t save Howard Hughes
Billionaire Howard Hughes, famous airplane 
designer, pilot, movie maker, and womanizer, 
lived from 1905 to 1976. It is well-known that 
he also happened to suffer from OCD. He had 
various symptoms, including intense fears of 
contamination along with elaborate rituals for 
handling all sorts of objects. His symptoms 
worsened over time, and he disappeared from 
public view in his later years. In those last years, 
he spent his days and nights lying naked in bed 
in darkened hotel rooms — as a way of creating 
what he considered to be a germ-free zone. He 
even burned his clothes if someone near him 
was stricken ill.
Unfortunately, little was known about the 
treatment of OCD in Howard Hughes’ day. It 
wasn’t until the 1970s that ERP was studied 
and found to be an effective treatment for OCD. 
Furthermore, effective medication options for 
OCD weren’t available. Today, Howard Hughes 
could be treated with a good expectation of 
success. You can, too, and you don’t even need 
billions of dollars.

108
Par t II: Starting Down the Treatment Path 
 
 Is your treatment for OCD confined to single, one-hour sessions each 
week? Sometimes effective OCD treatment calls for more frequent and 
longer sessions. These may or may not be covered by your insurance, 
so you may want to ask about that as well. Your provider may be able 
to facilitate obtaining coverage for OCD treatment that exceeds usual 
policy coverage. That’s because the treatments that really work for OCD 
often require more than one standard, 50-minute session per week.
If you receive the answers you hoped to hear, ask yourself how talking with 
that person felt. Were you comfortable? Did you feel rushed? Did the person 
sound interested in treating your problem? If your answers are positive, 
make an appointment! If you talk to someone who doesn’t have a lot of expe-
rience with OCD, ask for a recommendation — many professionals who don’t 
treat OCD themselves know of others who do.
Understanding What 
to Expect in Therapy
When the door closes and the first session begins, feeling a bit nervous is 
normal. Whether you’re going to a psychologist, psychiatrist, social worker, 
or counselor, generally the initial session is one in which you are asked a lot 
of questions. The questions are the start of the assessment process. Your 
therapist is trying to understand you and your symptoms in order to come 
up with a treatment plan. Therapists have different approaches, but generally 
the following areas are covered in the first session:
 
 Problems: What are your current symptoms? How severe are they? How 
often do they occur? Do certain situations make them worse? Do you avoid 
people, places, or situations? Do your obsessions or compulsions interfere 
with your life? How are your moods? How do you handle anger? How do 
you sleep? Has your appetite changed lately? Do you have trouble making 
decisions or concentrating? Do you ever have trouble thinking clearly?
 
 Daily responsibilities: Do you work in or out of the home? How are you 
handling your responsibilities? Have there been any recent changes in 
your job, family, or finances? Do you have trouble following through on 
important tasks?
 
 Safety: Have you ever thought about hurting yourself? Have you ever 
attempted suicide? Do you feel hopeless? Have you ever worried about 
hurting anyone else? Have there been times in your life when you have 
lost control and hurt someone?
 
 History: When did you first notice these problems? Have there been 
times when the symptoms have decreased or increased? Have you had 
other emotional problems in the past? Have members of your family had 
emotional or behavioral problems?

109
 Chapter 7: Get ting Help For OCD
 
 History of treatment: Have you ever seen a therapist before? What was 
your experience like? Did you learn anything useful? Do you have any 
complaints about your past therapy?
 
 Health: Are you healthy? Have you ever had significant health problems? 
Serious injuries? Are you taking any medications? Have you ever taken med-
ication for an emotional problem in the past? If so, was it effective? Do you 
smoke or drink? How much and how often? Do you use any other drugs?
 
 Trauma: Have you ever been abused? Are you afraid of someone hurt-
ing you? Have you ever been exposed to traumatic events? Has anyone 
close to you experienced trauma?
 
 Anything else: Is there anything else that you would like to mention 
during this session?
Don’t expect the first session to be primarily focused on the symptoms of 
OCD. That’s because critical areas like safety, health, and functioning must 
be considered before treating OCD. For example, if you’re feeling suicidal, 
that danger must be addressed immediately. Or there could be significant 
substance abuse that may have to be dealt with before OCD treatment can be 
effective. Furthermore, your therapist may discover that you’re not actually 
suffering from OCD, but something else entirely — or that you have OCD in 
addition to one or more other problems.
The first session is also a time for you to assess how comfortable you are 
talking about your problems. Ask yourself whether you were able to commu-
nicate your concerns and leave the session with hope.
Keeping your therapy private
Maybe you’ve heard the saying, “What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas.” 
The implication is that whatever you choose to do in Las Vegas, no one else 
ever has to know about it. The therapeutic relationship is like this saying in 
that what you say in therapy, stays in therapy.
The relationship that you have with your therapist is unique because of the 
practice of confidentiality — the promise that what you say will not be dis-
closed to others. Without that promise (backed by law), therapy would not 
feel safe, nor would it be very effective. There are only a few exceptions to 
this confidentiality rule, such as:
 
 Abuse: If you tell your therapist that you are abusing someone, your 
therapist may have to inform authorities.
 
 Dangerousness: If your therapist feels that you pose an imminent 
danger to yourself or others, authorities may have to be informed.

110
Par t II: Starting Down the Treatment Path 
 
Having intense worry that you may hurt someone else (but finding the thought 
abhorrent) is not usually considered a sign of dangerousness. In fact, it’s more 
likely a sign of a particular type of OCD (see Chapter 2 and 14). Those people 
are generally at lower risk than most people of actually hurting someone, so 
your therapist won’t be calling authorities if that’s the case for you.
Finally, your therapist could be subpoenaed if you are involved in litigation. 
This issue should be discussed prior to beginning therapy if it is potentially 
relevant to you. Exceptions such as these are rather rare, and you should 
be sure to talk about them in detail with your therapist if you have any con-
cerns. Overall, you can rest assured that what you say in therapy will remain 
in confidence with your therapist.
Digging deep into an OCD diagnosis
Sometimes diagnosing OCD can be pretty difficult. After the first interview, 
the doctor or therapist will often use a more formal checklist, test, or inter-
view to better understand your symptoms. Common instruments include:
 
 Obsessive Compulsive Inventory: This is a questionnaire that assesses 
a broad range of obsessions and compulsions and evaluates the severity 
of the symptoms.
 
 Structured Clinical Interview for the DSM-IV (SCID): This is a compre-
hensive, time-consuming interview that is usually used in research stud-
ies. The questions pertain to a very wide range of symptoms.
 
 The Padua Inventory: This 60-item questionnaire was first developed in 
Italy and is used to assess the level of distress a person with OCD 
symptoms is experiencing.
 
 The Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS): This is prob-
ably the most commonly used interview to nail down the specifics of 
OCD. The Y-BOCS asks about obsessions and compulsions that have 
to do with contamination fears, hoarding, religion, symmetry, sexual 
obsessions, aggressive obsessions, worries about illness, superstitious 
thoughts, rituals, and checking (of locks, appliances, and so on). There 
are several forms of Y-BOCS, including a clinician interview, a self-
report, and a children’s form.
Not all practitioners use all of these instruments, but your therapist is likely 
to ask many questions specific to a wide variety of OCD types. Your therapist 
will also want to know about the triggers that set your OCD off. Be patient; 
the evaluation and assessment process can take up to two or three sessions. 
But that time will pay off by allowing your therapist to know what symptoms 
to target and in what order.

111
 Chapter 7: Get ting Help For OCD
Speaking the truth to your therapist
Lots of people believe that psychologists or psychiatrists have special 
powers and can read the minds of the people they treat. Oh, if only it were 
true. Our job sure would be a lot easier. Although our training and experience 
provide us with the ability to understand, diagnose, and treat emotional 
disorders — and we are usually pretty good at understanding our clients — 
we can be fooled.
Most people who step into a therapist’s office want to be helped. But some-
times they’re embarrassed to discuss their deepest fears, worries, weak-
nesses, or thoughts. It’s human nature to try and present a good front. And 
the thoughts and worries that the OCD brain gives you can feel disturbing.
Nonetheless, we urge you to dig down deep and open up with your mental- 
health professional. Believe it or not, there are very few symptoms that 
professionals experienced in treating OCD haven’t heard about. As you read 
other chapters in this book, you may see that at least a number of your symp-
toms show up. It may help to know you’re not the only person in the world to 
experience troubles like yours.
Evaluating your therapist
After you’ve been to two or three sessions, the evaluation phase is usually 
complete. Soon thereafter, you need to start an evaluation of your own. Does 
your therapist seem like a good fit for you? Does there seem to be a reason-
able game plan for your therapy?
Getting to know you
The relationship between you and your therapist matters. Considerable 
research tells us that the quality of that relationship contributes a lot to the 
amount of progress you’re likely to make. So, what makes a good relationship 
with a therapist? Here are some questions to ask yourself:
 
 Do I feel comfortable telling my therapist almost anything? If the answer 
is no, that’s something you should discuss. If you still feel uncomfortable 
after that discussion, you may not have the right therapist. On the other 
hand, if your own shame is what keeps you from discussing your thoughts 
or feelings with your therapist, that difficulty can also be discussed.
 
 Do I feel judged or criticized? Good therapists are experts at not judg-
ing or criticizing their clients. Your therapist may not think what you’re 
doing is a great idea (such as checking the stove 40 times each hour), 
but you shouldn’t feel put down for that. If you do feel criticized or 
judged, that’s something to discuss.

112
Par t II: Starting Down the Treatment Path 
 
 Does my therapist seem to really listen? If your therapist is playing a video 
game during your session, that’s really not a good sign! But seriously, you 
need to feel truly heard. Signs of being listened to include eye contact, head 
nods, expressions of concern or empathy, and being provided with brief 
summaries of what you’ve said.
 
 Does my therapist speak to me in language I can understand? 
Occasionally therapists use professional jargon. However, most of them 
try to communicate clearly and only use technical words when they 
must. You should feel comfortable asking for clarification of any idea or 
word your therapist uses.
 
 How do I feel talking with my therapist? You should feel that your 
therapist cares about you and wants to help. Therapy is a professional 
relationship and not the same as a friendship. However, like a friend, a 
therapist should be reasonably warm and understanding.
 
The treatment of OCD will likely involve times of discomfort and some struggle. 
Having the support of a therapist who has a good connection with you is 
important. But you also need a good game plan.
Reviewing the game plan
Therapy for OCD involves more than a good relationship, as important as 
that is. In addition, your therapist needs to help you devise a set of goals 
and come up with a plan to reach them. By the third or fourth session, you 
should know whether you have OCD. You should also know whether you 
have problems above and beyond OCD.
You and your therapist should discuss how you plan to address the prob-
lems. Your therapist should be using one or more of the therapies discussed 
in Chapters 8, 9, 10, and 11. You should have some idea of which problems 
are to be tackled, in what order, and with what strategies. If you’re unclear 
about the game plan, ask. Both of you should have some idea of what prog-
ress will look like as well.
 
Occasionally, therapists and clients find that they are not a good match. 
For example, you may feel you’re not being heard or supported, and your 
attempts to discuss the issue don’t improve things. Or you may find that your 
therapist’s training in OCD is lacking and goals are not made clear to you. Or 
maybe your therapist looks exactly like your ex-spouse or mother — possibly 
taking your attention away from a collaborative relationship. In any event, if 
you feel things aren’t working, first discuss the issue with your therapist. If 
that doesn’t work, look for a new therapist.

Part III
Overcoming OCD

In this part . . .
I
n this part we bring you good news. Whereas OCD was 
considered almost untreatable a few decades ago, 
today you have several good options for getting real help. 
These treatments are now backed by solid scientific 
research. In this section, we discuss Cognitive-Behavioral 
Therapy (CBT) as well as mindfulness, exposure and 
response prevention (ERP), and medications. The vast 
majority of people who have OCD will find one or more of 
these approaches quite helpful. We illustrate these treat-
ments with examples primarily related to Contamination 
OCD because it is the most common type of OCD.

C
ognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is based on the relationship between 
your thoughts and the way you feel. The premise is that the way you 
interpret situations (what you think) determines your emotional response 
(what you feel). Hundreds of studies have shown that learning to change the 
way you think can improve the way you feel.
If you have OCD, you tend to misinterpret aspects of your reality in various 
ways. This leads to a sort of misalignment between how you feel about what’s 
going on around you and the actual reality of the situation.
Researchers have identified a number of ways that people with OCD tend to 
interpret or think about situations related to their OCD that are particularly 
problematic. In this chapter, we present seven ways that OCD sufferers mis-
interpret events and provide various CBT-based methods for changing them. 
Modifying these misinterpretations allows you to develop more balanced ways 
of thinking that reduce your OCD and the distress that goes along with it.
Because contamination fears are the most common type of OCD, many of 
the examples in this chapter (as well as Chapters 9 and 10) focus on this par-
ticular type of OCD. Never fear; the material we provide here can be readily 
applied to other types of OCD, and specific chapters are devoted to other 
types of OCD as well.

116
Par t III: Overcoming OCD 
Realigning Interpretations with Reality
While people with OCD interpret many events in their lives rationally, in the 
same way that most people do, they interpret portions of their lives in highly 
distorted ways. The distorted interpretations primarily occur in response to 
events that have something to do with that person’s OCD. So someone with 
Contamination OCD perceives a dirty towel as dangerous, but probably does 
not obsess about running people over on the way to work. And someone with 
symmetry OCD looks at disorder with shock and dismay, but isn’t likely to 
worry about dirty towels.
Seeing common types of OCD distortions
These seven ways of misinterpreting reality show you how the thinking of 
those with OCD is distorted. Regardless of the specific type of OCD one has, 
these misinterpretations are quite common:
 
 Doubting
 
 Exaggerating risk
 
 Viewing thoughts as real
 
 Confusing facts and feelings
 
 Needing perfection
 
 Needing to control thoughts
 
 Being excessively responsible
See Chapter 5 for more information about how these types of thinking inter-
act with and aggravate OCD. Although a few of these types of distorted 
perceptions show up in other emotional disorders as well, they appear espe-
cially troublesome for those with OCD.
Using CBT to correct distorted thinking
CBT applies techniques that aim to improve well-being by bringing about 
specific changes in the way you think and behave (see Chapters 9 and 10 for 
more strategies based on CBT). CBT, when applied to these distorted OCD 
interpretations, helps you more accurately align your feelings with reality.
In this section, we look at seven ways of misinterpreting reality commonly 
associated with OCD (see the preceding section for a list). We also show you 
how CBT can be employed to realign these types of distorted thinking.

117
 Chapter 8: Cleaning Up OCD Thinking with a CBT Reality Check
Defeating unreasonable doubts
The doubts that plague those with OCD are not based on reality, direct evi-
dence, or the actual here and now, but rather on imagined scenarios that are 
concocted in the sufferer’s mind. What all these OCD doubts have in common 
is that they’re not tied to experience and information from the body’s senses, 
that is, sight, touch, sound, smell, and taste. For example, the obsession about 
whether one closed the windows in the house before leaving is not connected 
to not having felt the windows actually click shut. Similarly, those imagined 
microbes emanating from the microwave cannot be seen, felt, or touched.
People with OCD accept a reasonable degree of uncertainty and doubt in 
some areas of their lives. For example, they may assume that the sun will 
rise and set each day, even knowing there could be a slight possibility that 
it won’t. But when the OCD mind takes control over a particular topic or 
concern (for example, contamination, harming others, and so forth) doubt 
permeates, creating a haze that makes seeing reality almost impossible. Even 
though they usually know their thoughts are going against their own common 
sense and gut feelings, OCD sufferers repeatedly lose out to the “what if” 
mentality. In other words, they distrust their own senses and perceptions. So 
they ask themselves:
 
 What if I don’t scrub the counters with bleach?
 
 What if I left the windows unlocked?
CBT: Changing thoughts versus 
changing behaviors
The first highly successful treatment for OCD 
was developed in the late 1960s and was a 
specific cognitive behavioral technique called 
exposure and response prevention (ERP). See 
Chapter 10 for more information about ERP. 
Subsequent research over several decades has 
consistently demonstrated that ERP works very 
well. There’s just one problem — many people 
refuse ERP and/or drop out of the treatment 
before they complete it.
Why do people drop out of or even refuse ERP 
altogether? Well, it’s icky, yucky, and sometimes 
downright disgusting. For example, people with 
worries about dirt and germs may find them-
selves instructed by their therapists to touch 
dirt, doorknobs, toilet seats, urine, and maybe 
even the inside of a dumpster. People who fear 
hurting somebody may be asked to talk about 
stabbing loved ones, pick up knives, and carry 
babies they fear they may harm. As you can 
imagine, not exactly everybody is willing to do 
those things — even with the guidance of a 
trusted, competent therapist.
Because of these concerns, behavioral scien-
tists have searched for other ways to treat OCD. 
Early research findings support the idea that 
Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) techniques 
primarily aimed at improving thinking are effec-
tive for OCD, and for some may be as effective 
as the specific CBT strategy known as ERP. CBT 
thinking techniques are often combined with 
ERP as well.

118
Par t III: Overcoming OCD 
 
 What if I lose control and shove that person I am walking behind?
 
 What if I take that knife out and stab my dog?
 
 What if that microwave is emitting radioactive microbes?
Obsessive thoughts that cause distress are usually based on a premise that 
something really bad may happen. Doubt lurks behind almost all obsessions. 
Maybe, just maybe the obsession will come true if action is not taken to 
prevent it.
Distinguishing doubts from what’s real
Most true dangers have elements that can be directly sensed. Natural gas comes 
with an added smell of rotten eggs to serve as a warning. And if something is 
burning on your stove, you can see or smell smoke coming from the kitchen.
Of course, some dangers are not easily detectable by the average person’s 
senses. In many of these cases, warning signs are posted, such as, “Danger: 
High Voltage,” “Danger: Radioactive Materials,” or “Warning: Non-Potable 
Water.” Or a loud siren may be sounded to warn of tornados in the area. 
Those warning signs are put there by people who are knowledgeable about 
the risks and whose senses (often aided by scientific instruments) enable 
them to assess specific risks that others might not be aware of. The signs 
themselves, though, are directly observable by your senses.
The OCD mind creates warning signs based entirely on made-up, fanciful 
material. The story of doubt becomes grabbing and compelling because it 
can’t be disconfirmed absolutely. But as the story departs from that which 
can be confirmed by your senses, it also drifts far from any likely reality.
Dismissing unrealistic doubts
The first step toward changing the way you think is becoming aware of the 
basis for your thoughts. If you’re plagued by OCD doubts, ask yourself the fol-
lowing questions to help you realize that these doubts are not realistic:
 
 Are your doubts based on direct information from your senses (sight, 
sound, smell, taste, or touch)?
 
 Does your doubt seem to have a life of its own and keep coming back, 
even without new evidence to support it?
 
 Is there anything about your doubt that other people would see as illogical?
 
 Is there anything that would convince you that your doubt is likely false?
Realistic doubts are based on evidence from the senses, they don’t keep 
returning without new supporting evidence, other people see them as rea-
sonable, and they can be disproved or proved. Realistic doubts keep you safe 
from danger, but OCD doubts only keep you upset.

119
 Chapter 8: Cleaning Up OCD Thinking with a CBT Reality Check
The following story about Pam and Debbie shows you how realistic doubts 
and OCD doubts are as different as night and day.
Pam and Debbie are sales representatives for a large pharmaceutical 
company. Their jobs require weekly travel. A few months earlier, they 
both came down with a case of food poisoning after eating hamburgers in 
a messy airport restaurant. Pam happens to have OCD and Debbie does 
not. Since the illness, Pam’s OCD goes into hyper-drive whenever she 
travels. She no longer eats at restaurants, opting to carry her own food 
wherever she goes.
At a sales conference, Pam and Debbie are seated at the same table for a 
company luncheon. They reminisce about their previous bad experience 
at the restaurant together. Debbie tells Pam that she had a few qualms 
and doubts for a little while about eating in airport restaurants, and tends 
to avoid ordering rare hamburgers now; plus she checks the place out for 
general cleanliness.
Pam says, “That doesn’t do it for me. I haven’t gone into a restaurant ever 
since that happened.” She then pulls out her can of liquid meal replace-
ment for her lunch while she wipes the table top with a bleach towelette.
Debbie asks, “Are you on a diet?”
Pam says, “No, but this place is crawling with germs. You never know 
what the waiters have touched. Lots of times they don’t even wash their 
hands after going to the bathroom.”
Debbie responds, “It looks pristine and clean to me. What are you talking 
about?”
“You can’t see the microbes on the glasses, but I know they’re there. You 
should know too; we both got sick that way once. Some waiters carry 
hepatitis C. Do you know how horrible that is? You can catch it from 
unclean plates. That’s not going to happen to me — ever!”
An important point to take away from Pam and Debbie’s story is that some-
times OCD fears do come true. However, Debbie’s doubts are realistic and 
based on evidence from her senses. She now takes precautions to avoid 
undercooked meat and messy-looking restaurants. Pam, on the other hand, 
has interpreted events related to food and restaurants with extreme, non–
reality-based doubts and a refusal to accept any uncertainty. She avoids all 
restaurants and imagines microbes and diseases that cannot be seen.
How can you tell the difference between the two types of doubt? Filtering 
doubts through the series of questions we present earlier in this section can 
help you determine whether your doubts are reasonable or not. We do this 
with Debbie’s and Pam’s doubts in Table 8-1.

occasional qualm, 
but those have 
gotten much better 
with time.
Yes. The more Pam 
thinks about her 
doubts, the more they 
seem to grow. She 
does more and more 
things to avoid pos-
sible contamination.
Is there anything about your 
doubt that other people would 
see as illogical?
No. It is reasonable 
to avoid unclean 
restaurants and 
undercooked meat.
Yes. Most people 
know that eating in 
restaurants carries 
a slight risk, but they 
don’t make assump-
tions about unseen 
microbes and dis-
eases.
Is there anything that would 
convince you that your doubt 
is likely false?
Debbie uses evi-
dence about how 
restaurants look 
and cook their meat. 
She only had food 
poisoning once in 
her life and knows it 
could happen again, 
but probably not for 
a long time.
Because she can’t 
see the imagined 
microbes and dis-
eases, nothing can 
convince Pam that 
restaurants are 
essentially safe.
The answers to the questions in Table 8-1 illustrate how OCD doubts are not 
based on reality that is observable. And when doubts are not based on solid 
evidence and logic, the quest to disconfirm them never ends — because they 
simply cannot be totally disconfirmed. In fact, if you try to disprove OCD 
doubts, they only intensify because they can’t be absolutely proven as false.

121
 Chapter 8: Cleaning Up OCD Thinking with a CBT Reality Check
 
The OCD mind directs you to eliminate all doubts and uncertainty, especially 
in areas related to your OCD (such as contamination, imagined catastrophes, 
harming others, and symmetry). But doubt and uncertainty can never be fully 
eliminated and must be accepted as an inherent part of life.
Ending exaggerating risk
When thinking about their OCD-related concerns, OCD sufferers inflate the 
risks. And should any of those worries actually come true, the OCD mind sub-
stantially exaggerates the degree of suffering that is likely to result. This way 
of interpreting the world keeps anxiety and distress levels high.
Most people without OCD know that touching a doorknob could conceivably 
allow a cold virus to infect them. However, they proceed to touch many door-
knobs each day knowing that the actual risk they incur each time is rather 
small. And they know that catching a cold is hardly catastrophic.
However, for someone with OCD contamination obsessions, each and every 
doorknob is crawling with millions of highly contagious viruses of all kinds — 
flu, HIV, colds, tuberculosis, SARS, you name it. A touch of a doorknob sets 
off emergency warning sirens in the OCD mind. These sirens urge the person 
to take immediate action to eliminate the viruses and avoid illness. Even the 
possibility of a cold becomes greatly feared because there’s at least some 
chance that a cold could turn into pneumonia and ultimately result in death.
Doubting Thomas
The term doubting Thomas refers to a 
skeptic — one who is not easily convinced. The 
expression “doubting Thomas” comes from 
the biblical account of a disciple of Jesus. After 
Jesus was crucified, Thomas did not believe 
that Jesus had risen from the dead. Although 
other disciples told Thomas that Jesus had 
appeared to them, he wanted evidence. The 
following week, Jesus appeared to Thomas 
and allowed him to touch his wounds. After 
that, Thomas became a believer. He was able 
to see and touch Jesus. People with OCD have 
doubts as well. However, they don’t look to real 
evidence to check out their doubts.
Religious practices are largely based on faith 
rather than direct evidence from one’s senses. 
Faith is known to be extremely helpful for bil-
lions of people worldwide. However, faith and 
OCD don’t mix. OCD does not enhance people’s 
lives. So if you want to act on faith, do it with 
respect to spirituality, not to deal with obses-
sions and compulsions.

122
Par t III: Overcoming OCD 
One way to deal with the tendency of OCD to exaggerate risks is to check 
the evidence and logic of one’s obsessive fears. You may find that this helps 
you reevaluate the exaggerated risks that your OCD mind is fooling you with. 
Working with a therapist can greatly facilitate this process. Consider answer-
ing these questions:
 
 Do I have any direct evidence that is contrary to my fears?
 
 Do I have any direct evidence to confirm my fears?
 
 How often have my fears of this risk come true (versus not coming true) 
in the past?
 
 Is there anything about the risks I’m imagining that other people would 
likely see as illogical?
The following story of Blair illustrates how OCD can exaggerate risks and how 
her therapist helps her.
Blair is a 39-year-old CPA. She has struggled with OCD that’s focused on 
contamination and germs for years. Blair worries about contamination 
that may emanate from health-care facilities. There is a clinic near her 
workplace, and she walks several blocks out of her way in order to avoid 
coming close to the clinic.
Her therapist asks her to estimate the probability that serious, potentially 
lethal contaminates could be picked up simply by walking near the clinic. 
She tells him the risk is about 10 percent — not exactly a certainty, but 
rather troubling for the likelihood of contracting a serious, life-threatening 
infection. Her therapist guides her to a reexamination of her estimated 
risks. He asks her to search for any evidence or logic she can think of that 
might change her estimated risks. She comes up with the following 
evidence and logic:
 
 If the real risk was 10 percent, that would mean that a full 10 percent of 
those who walk by the clinic would die. Hard to imagine that someone 
wouldn’t have noticed that.
 
 If walking by a clinic incurs a 10 percent risk, then working there would 
probably kill off half of the employees within a short time. Blair assumes 
that’s not happening.
 
 Blair figures that she’s probably walked by hundreds, if not thousands, 
of doctors’ offices, hospitals, and clinics without even realizing it. If her 
estimate was real, she’d be dead by now.
Blair’s new evidence allows her to re-estimate her risks as far less than 1 percent. 
She is more ready to try her therapist’s next suggestion of walking by feared 
places like health clinics (ERP therapy; see Chapter 10 for more information).

123
 Chapter 8: Cleaning Up OCD Thinking with a CBT Reality Check
 
After you have scrutinized your OCD mind’s ways of misinterpreting risk, 
re-rate that risk once, and only once, for any given thought. Do not keep 
returning to this exercise. If you do, the technique can actually become a com-
pulsion that you are using to reassure yourself (see Chapter 5 for the problem 
with reassurance with OCD). Used once, and only once, for any particular OCD 
thought, this strategy can help you see that risks are much smaller than you 
think and allow you to work on accepting a certain amount of uncertainty in 
your life.
Rethinking the idea that 
thoughts have real power
If you have OCD, you may give thoughts far more importance than they merit. 
Just because you think something weird, strange, immoral, or cruel, does not 
mean that you are bad, crazy, or mean. All people have weird thoughts once 
in a while. That’s perfectly normal. When that happens to most people, the 
thoughts are quickly dismissed or forgotten. Not so in OCD. The OCD mind 
takes thoughts way too seriously, thereby causing anxiety, guilt, shame, and 
revulsion.
Calculating real probabilities
About 5,000 people die each year from food
poisoning in the United States. No wonder con-
cern about contaminated food is common among 
those with OCD — nothing seems illogical about 
that. However, let’s turn to a little basic math to 
see how dangerous our food supply is. At last 
count, over 304 million people lived in the United 
States. Most of those people eat three meals a 
day, 365 times each year. So take 304 million × 3 × 
365, and you get 332,880,000,000 (a little more than 
332 billion) meals consumed each year. Five thou-
sand of these meals kill someone. Thus, your odds 
of dying from any given meal are about one in 
6,657,600. Even over a lifetime that risk only climbs 
to about one in 85,353. So relax, and take another 
bite out of that medium-rare hamburger.
By contrast, only a minority of those with OCD 
focus on fears of dying from heart disease, dia-
betes, respiratory disease, or stroke. However, 
you have almost a 40 percent chance of dying 
from one of those causes.
People are often more concerned about food 
poisoning than these far more likely causes of 
death because the media headlines each and 
every outbreak of salmonella and such every 
time one occurs. By contrast, they do not blare 
announcements about Joe Blow’s heart attack.
Obviously, you want to avoid buying tomatoes 
or spinach when there is a sudden, known out-
break. And you should wash your vegetables 
thoroughly and avoid leaving your mayonnaise 
out on the counter for three hours.
The bottom line: OCD tells you to spend serious 
amounts of time attempting to prevent relatively 
improbable events. Consider spending less time 
on OCD and more time on improving your health 
through exercise and diet.

124
Par t III: Overcoming OCD 
Just because you think something doesn’t make it true. Imagine that you have 
an obnoxious manager at work. After a frustrating day, you think, “I wish I 
could wave a magic wand and make him disappear.”
Pretend that the offensive manager just happens to run away to Tahiti with 
his secretary the very next day (leaving his job, wife, and children). You 
celebrate, throw a party. But someone with OCD may think that the thought 
of wanting someone to disappear caused the occurrence. The OCD mind 
may say, “I had a bad thought; therefore, I am a horrible person. My thought 
caused my manager to run away. I have ruined the lives of his poor wife and 
seven children.”
An obsession is an unwanted, intrusive thought. Everyone has obsessive 
thoughts once in a while. Say you don’t have OCD and you think, “Wow, 
it’s really hot in my office today. I feel like taking off all my clothes!” Do you 
worry that you might start stripping? Probably not. In fact, you may not think 
about the thought at all and go get yourself a cold drink instead.
But if you have OCD and you have the same thought, your OCD mind may 
say something like this: “Oh my, I am really a weirdo. I wonder how many 
other people in the office know what I’m thinking? People must think I’m 
loony. What if I can’t control myself, and I actually rip off my clothes? How 
can I stop myself? I better start counting the ceiling tiles to distract myself 
from that horrible thought. I’m starting to sweat. People will know. I better go 
home. I hope I can make it to the car without losing it completely.”
 
If your OCD mind tricks you into thinking that thoughts are very important, try 
this experiment to help you understand that thoughts don’t equal action:
 
1. Put a glass of water next to this book on a table.
 
2. Stare at the water.
 
3. Now say to yourself, “I think I am going to spill the water on top of this 
book with my thoughts alone.”
 
4. Say it again.
 
5. Think really hard.
 
6. Did you spill the water?
We would safely bet that most readers did not spill the water. You can’t make 
things happen just by thinking them. And if you did spill the water just by 
thinking about it, a visit to Las Vegas may be in order. Be sure to invite us to 
join you.
 
Think up some other experiments to help you remember that bad thoughts 
are not the same as bad actions — that thinking about something does not 
cause it to happen. Be creative. If you’re working with a therapist, this may be 
a very good activity to bring up in a session. Here are a few examples of other 
experiments designed to show you that thoughts don’t cause events:

125
 Chapter 8: Cleaning Up OCD Thinking with a CBT Reality Check
 
 Take out a ten-dollar bill and stare at it. Try to turn it into a 100-dollar 
bill. Command it to change. (Note: It doesn’t count if an unexpected 
check shows up in your mailbox in a few days — that’s just a random 
happening).
 
 Stare at your car and command it to change color. If it’s white, try turn-
ing it to black. Good luck; let us know how you did. Consider starting an 
auto painting business if you succeed.
 
 Stare at the speed-limit signs on your daily commute and command 
them to raise the limit so you can speed your way along. By the way, 
don’t start speeding until they actually change.
Unconfusing facts and feelings
Feelings serve many purposes. For example, feelings may give you joy and 
pleasure or they may warn you of impending danger. But when OCD kicks in, 
feelings lead you astray. That’s because OCD causes the brain to turn on the 
burglar alarm when there’s no actual sign of a break-in (see Chapter 4 for the 
biological explanation of this process).
People with OCD are flooded with feelings of dread and doom when no logical 
cause for alarm exists. However, the OCD mind tells them that there must be 
a real reason for these feelings. And if the feelings are true, whatever meaning 
you associate with those feelings must be true, too. For example:
 
 I feel ashamed, so I must be a sinner.
 
 I feel dirty, so I must be contaminated.
 
 I feel dizzy, so I must have a brain tumor.
 
 I feel guilty, so I must have done something wrong.
 
 I feel out of sorts, so I must be coming down with something.
 
 I feel scared, so there must be real danger.
Feelings like the ones listed above can be very powerful. Anxious, negative 
feelings are merely an indication that your brain’s alarm system has been 
set off — but just like a home burglar alarm system, lots of false alarms can 
occur. Winds, a neighbor’s cat, your teenage son sneaking in late at night, 
and an electrical short can also start the sirens blaring.
To get a grip on your feelings, start reminding yourself that feeling bad 
doesn’t mean you are bad or that something bad is going on. When your 
brain’s alarm system goes off, resist the urge to scream, run, or hide. Hold 
off on making a judgment, and carefully check for evidence. If you can’t find 
clear signs based on what you can see, hear, smell, taste, or feel, consider 
assuming the alarm was false. With lots of practice, you can stop your brain 
from setting off so many false alarms.

126
Par t III: Overcoming OCD 
Overcoming the need for perfection
Perfection permeates the OCD mind by telling you that mistakes are horrible 
and must be avoided at all costs. Perfectionism leads to procrastination and 
avoidance because perfection is impossible to obtain. For example, a student 
may write and rewrite a paper and never turn it in because she knows it must 
contain errors. Although many people without OCD struggle with perfection-
ism from time to time, OCD ups the ante. How can you ever be 100 percent 
sure that
 
 You will never say anything that could offend anyone, ever?
 
 The books are lined up precisely and perfectly?
 
 The kitchen counters have absolutely no microbes or germs of any kind?
 
 The tone of voice and words in your prayer are exactly what God 
demands of you?
If these kinds of concerns plague you, you may want to ask yourself these 
questions:
 
 Does my perfectionism benefit my life?
 
 Does my perfectionism hurt me in any way?
 
 If a friend of mine had such perfectionistic thoughts, what would I tell him?
 
 What would my life be like if I allowed for a little more leniency in the 
way I judge myself?
 
Most perfectionists have far more compassion and understanding for the 
flaws and foibles of others than they have for themselves. Learning to judge 
yourself by the same standards you set for your friends may help you let go of 
the excessively harsh standards you set for yourself.
Sidestepping obsessive thoughts
One of the hallmarks of OCD is that the thoughts, urges, and impulses known 
as obsessions become extremely upsetting and unwanted. Therefore, most 
people with OCD feel driven to rid themselves of their obsessions. The prob-
lem with that strategy is that it flat-out doesn’t work. Not only that, trying to 
suppress thoughts actually intensifies them. And as the thoughts intensify, so 
does the distress.
In the story that follows, Marty is plagued by the obsession that any dirty 
thoughts could alter his brain and actually cause him to contract brain 

127
 Chapter 8: Cleaning Up OCD Thinking with a CBT Reality Check
cancer. Marty believes that his thoughts have special powers (see the earlier 
section, “Rethinking the idea that thoughts have real power”), so this belief 
causes him to work very hard at ridding himself of any dirty thoughts. The 
story shows you what happens as he tries to suppress his thoughts.
Marty works at an electronics store at the mall. He has obsessions 
about the possibility that he could lose control and fondle women inap-
propriately when they walk into his store — abhorrent, dirty thoughts. 
Whenever Marty has those thoughts, he believes his brain begins to 
become contaminated with carcinogens.
From that premise, it’s pretty easy to understand why Marty desperately 
tries to suppress all such thinking. However, the more he tries not to 
have the thoughts, the more they grow. He finds that day after day, he 
spends more time trying to “not think” about these things. He sings to 
himself, he tries to repeat phrases such as “Clean thoughts/clean mind,” 
and he repeatedly counts the inventory even though that task is only 
required once each month. His co-workers start noticing that he seems 
distracted all the time.
Attempting to suppress thoughts causes them to increase for a pretty simple 
reason. When you try to avoid thinking about something, you have to con-
stantly search your mind for any sign of the thoughts that you’re trying to 
avoid. The act of being on the lookout for the unwanted thoughts actually 
causes them to pop up to the surface more easily.
 
If you find yourself trying to control your OCD obsessional thoughts, try this 
experiment. You will see how trying to suppress thoughts usually just adds to 
your difficulties:
 
1. Pick one obsessional thought that you wish you didn’t have. Write that 
thought down in your OCD notebook.
 
2. Spend one day trying as hard as you can not to have the thought at all. 
At the end of the day, estimate how many times the thought managed to 
break through your defenses and pop into your mind and write it down. 
Also rate and record how disturbing the thought felt from 0 (not at all) 
to 10 (highly disturbing).
 
3. Spend the next day allowing the obsessional thought to do whatever it 
wants — pop into your mind or not. Again, write down your estimate of 
how many times the thought came into your mind and how disturbing it 
felt on a scale of 0 to 10.
 
4. Continue alternating days for at least six days (three suppressing days 
with three days of no attempt at suppressing).
 
5. Write down your conclusions and reflections about what attempting to 
suppress your thoughts does to you.

128
Par t III: Overcoming OCD 
You’re likely to discover that the harder you work to stop thinking about 
your obsessions, the more they increase and disturb you. If you find that 
thought control really works for you, go for it. We suspect that it won’t. If it 
does seem to work, most likely the effect will be temporary and partial. We 
suggest you work with a therapist if you discover that you’re continuing to 
struggle with attempts to control your thoughts.
Letting go of feeling excessively
responsible
People with OCD often believe that their thoughts, urges, or images — as 
well as their actions — actually cause harm to others or to themselves. They 
spend lots of time worrying about whether they may have done, said, or thought 
something that may possibly hurt someone. They dwell on the slightest pos-
sibility of causing such harm. Whenever an event has a bad outcome, they 
feel totally, morally responsible, even though they had little or no influence 
on the event and did not want it to happen.
One way to challenge your beliefs about being excessively responsible is to 
develop a picture of how responsible you really are by using a pie chart. The 
pie chart is a graph that illustrates all the factors that generate a particular 
outcome. The process goes like this:
 
1. Estimate the percentage of the bad outcome for which you believe 
you’re personally responsible.
 
2. List any other factors that could conceivably have contributed to the 
event. Assign percentages indicating the extent to which these other 
factors may also be responsible.
 
3. Make a pie chart to graph the percentages from Steps 1 and 2 
accordingly.
 
4. Examine the resulting chart to assess your relative responsibility for 
the outcome.
 
5. Develop a statement that affirms the fact that you are not solely 
responsible, and repeat it to yourself often.
The following example of Raul illustrates this process.
Raul works as a physical therapist at an assisted living facility. He 
obsesses about hurting the residents. He imagines pushing frail, elderly 
people down the stairs, dumping them from their wheelchairs, or suffo-
cating them. Of course he has never hurt any of his patients and finds the 

129
 Chapter 8: Cleaning Up OCD Thinking with a CBT Reality Check
idea totally repugnant, but he has repeated urges, images, and thoughts. 
When any of the residents becomes ill or dies, Raul believes that he is 
fully responsible for the outcome. He thinks he surely could have done 
something to prevent the illness or death. He obsesses over whether he 
failed to wash his hands or maintain perfect care, or whether his thoughts 
alone caused the patient’s condition. He is disgusted with himself and 
believes that someday he will be punished for his horrible obsessions.
Following the death of one of his elderly patients, Raul’s distress is so 
great that he admits to his therapist how he believes he caused the 
death. His therapist, Dr. James, asks him to estimate exactly to what 
extent he owns personal responsibility for the patient’s death. Raul 
responds, “100 percent.” This is illustrated by the pie chart in Figure 8-1.
Dr. James draws a circle on the white board in his office. He labels it 
“Responsibility for Patient’s Death” and writes Raul’s name on it. He then 
turns to Raul and asks, “Are there any other possible factors that could 
have caused the death of this patient?”

Raul responds, “Well she was in her late 90s and she started with a bad 
cold. Then she caught that flu that’s been going around.”
“So Raul,” Dr. James expands, “her age may have been a factor, she had 
the flu, and she was already pretty frail. Let’s add these to the pie chart. 
Were there any other things that may have contributed?”
Raul goes on to say, “Well, she did have advanced chronic obstructive pul-
monary disease (COPD), which greatly increases the chances of dying from 
almost anything. And she’d had congestive heart failure for six years.”
Their conversation ultimately produces a wide variety of potential contribu-
tors to the patient’s death. At the end of the session, Raul and Dr. James 
conclude that he probably did not have much to do with the death of the 
98-year-old woman. The pie chart they develop is shown in Figure 8-2.
Raul remains concerned about his obsessions. Dr. James doesn’t really buy 
that Raul owns even 2 percent of the responsibility for the patient’s death. 
However, Raul still clings to feelings of guilt and shame. He dwells on the 
slight possibility that his 2 percent contribution may have been the tip-
ping point. Thus, Dr. James tells Raul that continued work on his excessive 
responsibility OCD is necessary.

However, this exercise helps Raul understand that his obsessive urges and 
impulses don’t really have the power to hurt others. He still feels somewhat 
responsible, but using the pie chart technique helps him talk back to his OCD. 
He learns to say, “Just because I feel overly responsible, doesn’t mean that I 
am. No one’s care can be perfect, and even if it were, people would still die.”
 
The pie chart technique helps people realize that many factors are involved 
in outcomes. Usually no one person or one reason can be held 100 percent 
responsible when something bad happens.
Pushing Out OCD Thinking 
with New Narratives
Mysteries, horror, and science fiction capture the minds and emotions of 
audiences all over the world. The audience is immersed in a story that may 
be highly unlikely or even illogical, but it appears possible because the audi-
ence suspends judgment and logic for a few hours. When the movie or book 
reaches a conclusion, the audience returns to reality.
Is it a bird? A plane? No, it’s COMET
A Dutch study published in the February 2008 
journal The Behavior Therapist described the 
use of Competitive Memory Training (COMET) for 
a group of people with treatment-resistant OCD. 
The participants in the group had already aver-
aged 30 weeks of Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy 
(CBT) before starting COMET. The premise 
behind COMET is that some people retain nega-
tive emotions in memory that seem extremely 
hard to change. CBT helps counter disordered 
thinking, but some people still feel dreadful after 
CBT. So COMET teaches clients a positive script 
to substitute for negative thoughts when they’re 
feeling bad. In addition, they practice positive 
postures and facial expressions.
For example, a woman with an obsessive 
thought that she was going to harm a loved one 
would be taught to say, “I’m a good person who 
would never hurt anyone.” At the same time, 
she would smile, sit up straight, and recall the 
times that she was helpful to others in the past. 
The training would progress so that whenever 
she had an obsession, she would automatically 
put on a “happy face.”
Results of this small study were spectacular, 
given that they involved people who had failed 
to improve a great deal with standard effective 
therapies. Upon first glance at this article, to us 
it sounded a little like staring in the mirror and 
doing self-affirmations. However, we agree that 
the results appear to be promising and deserve 
more study.

132
Par t III: Overcoming OCD 
OCD grabs your mind and emotions in much the same manner, but the story 
or movie never ends. Logic and reality remain suspended. Endless skewed 
narratives (obsessive thoughts) that misinterpret reality exhaustively plague 
the OCD mind.
It’s as though those with OCD have a fiction writer living in their heads 
churning out compelling narratives, or stories, one after the other. The OCD 
mind sees just enough elements of possibility, to make the story seem totally 
believable. The best way to shut these OCD-fueled stories down is to rewrite 
your mind’s narratives and give them a good dose of reality. This involves a 
three-step process:
 
1. Making up OCD-like stories
 
2. Writing your own OCD narratives
 
3. Assessing and rewriting your OCD narratives
But before you start writing fictitious OCD stories, it’s a good idea to see 
what a typical OCD story looks like. Consider the story of Pam, whom we 
introduce in the earlier section, “Dismissing unrealistic doubts.” Pam has 
doubts about the safety of food, the cleanliness of restaurants, and the pos-
sibility of contracting diseases from waiters. Her OCD story contains many 
OCD misinterpretations. Her therapist suggests that she write out her 
complete OCD narrative. Here’s what she comes up with.
Germs are everywhere. I keep thinking about filth. You never know who 
might be sick or have open sores. If a waiter with hepatitis has a cut 
and then touches my plate, I could easily get hepatitis. If I get hepatitis, I 
could pass it on to my family before I even know I’m sick. I saw a waiter 
smoking a cigarette outside in the parking lot. The parking lot is full of 
germs from rotting food and animal droppings. The waiters can pick up 
dirt and feces on their shoes, and then contaminate their hands when 
they tie their shoes. Then they touch everything on the table. I’m not 
certain that all the glasses, plates, and utensils are sterilized after each 
meal. I look at the plates and feel disgusted; if I feel disgusted, I’m pretty 
sure that means they must be contaminated. Walking into a restaurant 
feels like walking into a cesspool. I was lucky to just get food poisoning. 
If I eat in a restaurant again, I could get something much worse. So, it 
makes sense to carry my own food in sterilized plastic bags. If I have to 
go to a restaurant for work, I just don’t eat. As soon as I’m out of there, I 
shower for at least 30 minutes, and then I sanitize my clothes.
Pam’s OCD narrative has many elements that seem reasonable. Germs are 
everywhere, miniscule amounts of feces are found in food, parking lots are 
dirty, and hepatitis is occasionally transmitted by food handlers. What makes 
this an OCD story is that Pam has no direct evidence to confirm or disconfirm 

133
 Chapter 8: Cleaning Up OCD Thinking with a CBT Reality Check
her concerns about all these contaminants making their way to her dinner 
plate. Her OCD story illustrates the following OCD misinterpretations:
 
 Confusing facts and feelings
 
 Doubting her own senses’ ability to detect cleanliness and safety
 
 Inflating the importance of her thoughts
 
 Overestimating the risk of getting sick
 
 Seeking unobtainable perfectionism (perfect cleanliness)
Due to the type of OCD misinterpretations she uses, her story spins entirely 
out of her OCD mind. You see how to write out your personal OCD stories 
and assess them for misinterpretations in the later sections of this chapter. 
But first, we want you to indulge in a little fantasy.
Creating made-up, OCD-like stories
In order to prepare you for dealing with your personal OCD stories, you may 
find it helpful to create OCD-like stories about things that you normally don’t 
worry about at all. Doing so allows you to see how similar these completely 
made-up stories are to those your OCD mind has already created. You can 
see that there is absolutely no end to such stories, and remind yourself that 
your personal OCD stories are merely fictitious creations of your OCD mind.
These fictitious stories are actually sort of fun to write. But the point of writing 
them is to remind yourself that these fanciful stories are exactly like the OCD 
stories that run through your mind and scare you all the time. Try viewing your 
OCD stories as creative, emotionally interesting, and even a little entertaining. 
Follow this process to author your own work of OCD fiction:
 
1. Think about some mundane, everyday event that causes you no par-
ticular worry or distress.
 
 Examples include walking along a sidewalk, searching for a book on the 
library’s shelves, going to the mall, or sitting in your hot tub. Just be 
sure to choose something that you do with no trouble and that’s unre-
lated to the actual OCD stories that currently run through your mind.
 
2. Include details concerning everything that could conceivably go 
wrong in your story. This can include contamination, death, illness, 
harm to others, imperfections, and so on.
 
3. Read your made-up story, and notice how similar it is to the ones 
that really do scare you. Compare it to the stories that run through the 
movie theater in your mind on a daily basis.

134
Par t III: Overcoming OCD 
 
4. Practice watching how creative the OCD mind can be. Consider writing 
two or three of these stories each day for a while.
 
5. Consider becoming a Hollywood horror-movie author. (Just kidding.)
We think you’ll discover that it isn’t difficult to imagine many conceivable 
scenarios of danger. For example, how worried are you right now, this very 
moment, that your house may ignite into a ball of fire? Probably not very (at 
least until we brought up the possibility).
Now turn on the OCD fiction writer and watch how the story unfolds:
Maybe the electrician who installed the wiring in your home office was 
smoking marijuana that day and crossed a few wires. It’s also possible 
that moisture has accumulated behind the walls and some connections 
are about to short out. Maybe your neighbors haven’t cleaned their fire-
place chimney and an ember could spark, fly out, and land on your roof. 
And the U.S. Navy just shot a satellite out of the sky. You can imagine a 
big chunk falling onto your house, setting it ablaze. It’s been awhile since 
you cleaned out the dryer vent. What if the cat tips over a lamp while 
you’re out and it ignites the curtains? Are you absolutely, positively cer-
tain that you turned off the stove?
The point is that the above scenario is remotely possible. But the OCD story 
is not based on anything that is happening right now. Of course you should 
take reasonable precautions to keep your house safe. But, the OCD fiction 
writer keeps these thoughts churning despite the lack of any objective sup-
porting evidence. And OCD doubt would not be assuaged by cleaning out the 
dryer vent — there’s always something else that could be done to prevent fire. 
In actuality, the list is potentially endless. You could no doubt spend every 
waking moment of each and every day trying to eliminate risks of fire and still 
not succeed 100 percent.
 
There is a small chance that writing fictitious OCD stories could cause you to 
develop a few new worries. If you find that to be the case for you, please stop 
this process and seek professional consultation. If your OCD is fairly severe 
(that is, quite worrisome and disruptive to your life), you should seek such 
consultation before attempting any of the exercises in this book on your own 
at all.
Writing down your OCD narratives
In order to change the endings to the OCD stories that run continuously through 
your mind, you need to write them out. Take some time to start writing your 
personal stories — the ones that actually run through your mind and worry you 
from day to day. Be sure to tell the whole story (or as they say in New Mexico, 

135
 Chapter 8: Cleaning Up OCD Thinking with a CBT Reality Check
“the whole enchilada”), including all your doubts, distorted interpretations, 
beliefs, reasoning, images, and worries — everything your mind tells you 
about your obsessions and compulsions. Here’s how:
 
 Write a complete narrative about every OCD fear or worry that 
bothers you.
 
 You don’t have to do all of these stories at once — you may need several 
writing sessions to complete the task. Write them down one at a time. 
Go back to your story a number of times and add details as they occur 
to you.
 
 Be sure to include all thoughts, images, and urges that run through 
your head as they relate to the OCD story.
 
 Write down what makes you believe in your OCD story — your rea-
soning process (regardless of whether it seems logical).
 
 Don’t forget to include your fears of what may happen if you fail to 
obey your OCD and take actions to avoid bad outcomes.
 
 Include any people or characters that may be involved in your story. 
Often stories revolve around harm to others.
Review your story fairly often and embellish it further if additional details 
come to mind. Don’t worry; we plan to help you change your story. In the 
next section, you find out how to write alternative, non-OCD stories to live 
by. But for now, you need to be aware of the existing stories and hear what 
they’re telling you.
Assessing and rewriting OCD narratives
After you’ve written out your OCD story, you’re ready to rewrite it with a dif-
ferent outcome. There are two steps to rewriting your OCD story:
 
1. Assessing your story
 
2. Creating a balanced story
Assessing your OCD narrative
In order to assess your OCD narrative, you need to determine what types of 
OCD misinterpretations (such as exaggerating risks, doubts, confusing facts 
and feelings, and so forth) your personal OCD story contains. Then you’ll 
have the information you need to write an alternative, balanced story. Here 
are questions that can help you analyze the elements of your narratives:
 
 Does your OCD story involve doubt? If so, is your doubt based on direct 
evidence?
 
 Would other people agree with your story or find it illogical?

136
Par t III: Overcoming OCD 
 
 How great is the risk of your OCD story happening? Are you exaggerating 
the risk?
 
 Are you viewing your thoughts as having special powers or as being real?
 
 Are you confusing your feelings with facts?
 
 Are you too worried about being perfect?
 
 Are you trying to control your thoughts?
 
 Are you being overly responsible and believing that you should be able 
to protect yourself and others from harm?
Write out the answers and take some time to reflect upon them. The answers 
alone will not greatly impact your OCD, but they will prepare you to write a 
new, more balanced story.
To give you a better idea of how this step works, take a look at Tracy’s story. 
Tracy is a 45-year-old elementary school teacher with contamination fears. 
Her story provides an opportunity for you to practice analyzing OCD stories 
for OCD misinterpretations. Then you’ll be ready to analyze your own OCD 
stories and, finally, rewrite them.
The modern world is full of radiation and unknown dangers from cell-
phone towers and other signals in the air. Whenever I spot a tower, I 
feel nervous and my entire body tingles. I am pretty sure it’s due to the 
signals bombarding my body and disrupting nerve cells. The danger lurks 
everywhere. Thousands of satellites beam signals all over the planet. So 
I’ve lined my car roof with aluminum foil. I also had contractors place 
rolls of foil across my entire attic. But I still worry. I wear hats lined with 
foil everywhere for a little extra protection. I try to explain these prob-
lems to my family, but they think I’m crazy. I tell them the things they 
should do to protect themselves. I’d just die if they got cancer when I 
could have prevented it. Sometimes, I try hard not to think about these 
dangers because the thoughts just upset me. But the thoughts keep 
coming back. Maybe my brain has become contaminated, and that’s pre-
venting me from being able to control my thoughts.
Now let’s take a look at Tracy’s story and analyze it for OCD misinterpreta-
tions. Is her story based on faulty logic or thinking? By applying the eight 
questions noted earlier, we can detect any faulty thinking:
 
 Does her OCD story involve doubt? If so, is her doubt based on direct 
evidence?
 
 As far as we can determine, Tracy’s story is full of OCD doubt and not 
based on any clear evidence. Perhaps someday science will figure out 
whether the types of signals Tracy worries about pose any real risk — 
but until that day, no justification exists for her actions.

137
 Chapter 8: Cleaning Up OCD Thinking with a CBT Reality Check
 
 Would other people agree with her story or find it illogical?
 
 Everyone that Tracy has shared her story with finds it quite unlikely.
 
 How great is the risk of Tracy’s OCD story happening? Is she exagger-
ating the risk?
 
 As is typical with OCD, Tracy is profoundly exaggerating risks.
 
 Is Tracy viewing her thoughts as having special powers or as being real?
 
 She believes that merely because she has these thoughts, they must be real.
 
 Is Tracy confusing her feelings with facts?
 
 Yes. She feels tingling in her body, which is probably due to anxiety. She 
then assumes that the tingling represents proof of damage to her body.
 
 Is Tracy too worried about being perfect?
 
 Tracy’s story does not show evidence that she is too much of a 
perfectionist.
 
 Is Tracy trying to control her thoughts?
 
 Yes, but like most people, she finds that attempts to control her 
thoughts just make the situation worse.
 
 Is Tracy being overly responsible and believing that she should be 
able to protect herself and others from harm?
 
 Yes, Tracy is assuming that she can do things to prevent cancer from 
occurring in her family by getting them to take the same actions she has — 
that is, by creating barriers to block signals and radiation.
By answering the preceding questions, you can see the types of OCD misin-
terpretations Tracy has been making. You can assess your own OCD stories 
the same way.
Creating a balanced narrative
Now it’s time to start writing an alternative, non-OCD story. This story will 
stand in sharp contrast to your OCD story. Your new story needs to take 
the opposite view. Consider how someone who doesn’t have OCD might tell 
the story. You probably won’t believe in this new story right away — that’s 
expected. However, with time and practice, you will make slow but sure prog-
ress toward buying into your new story.
 
Writing and rewriting your OCD stories will likely be much easier to do with the 
collaborative help of a therapist. If your OCD is fairly severe, please realize that 
while these exercises are likely to help you, you’ll also need to do many of 
the other strategies presented throughout this book. And we strongly suggest 
professional help.

138
Par t III: Overcoming OCD 
Here’s how to proceed:
 
 Take your time. Don’t expect to write your new story in one sitting.
 
 Include at least as many details in your non-OCD story as you have in 
your OCD story. Add even more details over time.
 
 Make sure your story is based only on evidence that you can see, 
touch, taste, feel, or hear.
 
 Act as if you believe your story. Read it and imagine it to be true sev-
eral times each day. Continue this process for a number of weeks.
 
 Don’t pull out your story to deal with distress that arises when your 
OCD story becomes active. Instead, read your new story repeatedly 
when you’re feeling okay.
 
 As you practice your story, start rating how much you believe in your 
balanced, non-OCD story. Also rate your belief in your OCD story and 
see whether it starts to slowly decline.
Following is Tracy’s new, non-OCD story. (See “Assessing your OCD narra-
tive” for the OCD version.) Because Tracy’s OCD is pretty severe, she enlists 
the help of a therapist to complete this exercise.
I realize that no one is on a mission to contaminate the world. Overall, 
most cancer rates have actually declined a little in the past decade. 
Telephone companies certainly don’t want to kill their customers off. 
Real people work for those companies and those people care about their 
own families and probably other people as well. My house and my car 
are safe, nice places to be. I enjoy spending time driving as well as having 
friends over to my home. I like going to other people’s homes. Their 
homes are as safe as they need to be. Cellphone towers help people stay 
in touch with each other. Satellites allow us to predict the weather, view 
movies on demand, and enjoy modern life.
Tracy reads and imagines scenes from her story regularly. She remembers 
not to pull it out in order to deal with her OCD story when it pops up. With 
lots of support and practice, she discovers that her OCD story feels less and 
less believable. Her new story slowly becomes more comfortable. She finds 
that living her life as if the new story were true feels much better.

Managing the OCD Mind
In This Chapter
 Disengaging from OCD
 Making attitude adjustments
 Practicing mindful meditation
I
n this chapter, we tell you about a treatment for OCD that involves apply-
ing various techniques based on the ancient practice of mindfulness. 
Practicing mindfulness involves adopting a set of attitudes and is a good pre-
cursor to meditation. Research supports the use of meditation and mindful-
ness as adjuncts to Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT).
Mindfulness has been increasingly incorporated into CBT. Exciting research 
on mindfulness-based techniques has shown significant promise. In fact, CBT 
that includes a mindfulness component has demonstrated actual, positive 
changes in brain areas thought to be involved with OCD. We expect many more 
studies on mindfulness to be carried out in the upcoming years. However, to 
date, relatively fewer large controlled studies on this approach exist than on 
the effectiveness of exposure and response prevention (ERP) — the focus of 
Chapter 10.
Separating Your Thoughts 
from Who You Are
The concept of mindfulness means attending to the present moment with 
openness and without judgment. Achieving mindfulness can seem very chal-
lenging when your mind is busily bubbling with obsessions and compulsions. 
You may wonder how you can be accepting of the present moment when the 
present moment feels so distressful and uncomfortable.
 
To achieve mindfulness, you must be able to recognize that the thoughts you 
think and who you are as a person are not one and the same.

140
Par t III: Overcoming OCD 
People with all types of emotional disorders universally fall into a trap set by 
their minds. And in truth, people who do not suffer from clear-cut emotional 
maladies sometimes fall into this same trap. The nature of this trap is that 
the mind tells you to take the thoughts it generates very seriously. The mind 
further dictates that you should believe that you and your thoughts are 
synonymous — one and the same.
But you need to realize that these directives from your mind are erroneous 
illusions. And believing in these illusions can lead you down a very rocky 
path indeed. The only way to avoid this trap is to find a way to step back and 
observe your OCD mind at work.
Here’s an exercise to help you see what we’re getting at. We call it 
“Discovering the Observant You versus Your OCD Thoughts.”
Building bridges from Buddhism 
to Western psychology
In the October 2006 issue of American 
Psychologist, Dr. B. Alan Wallace of the Santa 
Barbara Institute for Consciousness Studies and 
Dr. Shauna L. Shapiro of Santa Clara University 
discussed their views on and approach to inte-
grating Buddhist philosophy and mental-health 
practices. In contrast to traditional psychol-
ogy that often focuses on what is wrong with 
people, Buddhist philosophy is concerned 
with achieving states of balanced well-being. 
Wallace and Shapiro believe that good mental 
health consists of mental balance in four areas. 
Achieving this balance could help relieve OCD 
symptoms. The four areas are
  Conative Balance: Conative behavior 
means purposeful and goal-directed. A 
person must have willful intentions and 
carry them out. These intentions must be 
realistic, and consistent with the well-being 
of one’s self and others. For example, with 
OCD, there must be an intention or willing-
ness to face fear and some discomfort in 
order to benefit from treatment.
  Attentional Balance: Attentional balance 
refers to the ability to attend to and focus 
voluntarily. Lack of attentional control is 
a problem for those who suffer with OCD. 
They can be distracted by their obses-
sions and unable to concentrate on what 
is important. The development of voluntary 
and sustained attention allows a person 
with OCD to practice mindfulness instead 
of dwelling on obsessional thoughts.
  Cognitive Balance: Maintaining cognitive 
balance means having a clear mind that is 
open to experiences and not distorted by 
thoughts or emotions. A person with cog-
nitive balance is grounded in reality. For 
OCD sufferers, this means identifying OCD 
distortions that cloud their thinking (see 
Chapter 8).
  Affective Balance: Affective refers to 
one’s emotions. People with affective bal-
ance experience a full range of emotions 
and respond to reality with appropriate 
emotional expressions. They are empathic, 
compassionate, and joyful as appropriate, 
based on reality, as opposed to those with 
OCD who tend to become overly fearful and 
anxious because of their OCD beliefs.

141
 Chapter 9: Managing the OCD Mind
 
1. Sit down and make yourself comfortable.
 
2. Close your eyes and wait for a thought to pop into your mind — any 
thought at all. Your thought could be about
 
• How you’re feeling (relaxed, anxious, sad, whatever)
 
• The temperature in the room
 
• What this exercise has to do with OCD
 
• What you want to cook for dinner
 
• Wondering when a darn thought is finally going to pop into your 
mind — yes, that’s a thought too!
 
 You may have to wait a few seconds or perhaps a few minutes, but we’re 
pretty confident it won’t take too long for some sort of thought to cross 
your mind. After all, the mind is a master at generating thoughts one 
right after another.
 
 Obsessions are thoughts too. If an obsession is the first thing to pop into 
your mind, consider it a thought.
 
3. Now, ask yourself this question about your thought: Who noticed the 
thought?
The answer to that question is that there is an observant part of you that 
can see your thoughts separately from the part of you that generates your 
thoughts. Thus, you are not your thoughts. With time and practice, you 
can separate yourself from your thoughts — especially your OCD-related 
thoughts. Start listening for those OCD thoughts. Typical examples include
 
 I can’t stand not being certain that things will be okay.
 
 I could die from touching doorknobs.
 
 I could never use a public restroom.
 
 Public telephones are dangerous collectors of germs.
 
 Restaurants are full of contaminants that could kill me.
In Chapter 8, we tell you how to rethink the content of your thoughts — by 
examining the evidence, rewriting OCD stories, looking for OCD misinterpre-
tations, and so on. Now we suggest that you try your hand at viewing your 
OCD thoughts as simply random, meaningless output from your OCD mind. 
These thoughts can be interesting to observe, but they shouldn’t be taken 
too seriously.
Some simple mental exercises can help you put your thoughts into the proper 
perspective and let them go effortlessly. To that end, try the following:
 
 Close your eyes and imagine writing your OCD thought on a leaf. Then 
toss the leaf into a stream. Watch the leaf swirl in the eddies of the water 
as it slowly heads downstream.

142
Par t III: Overcoming OCD 
 
 Close your eyes and imagine you have a magic laser that writes your 
thoughts onto a cloud high in the sky. Just watch the cloud slowly drift.
 
 Repeatedly remind yourself that “thoughts are merely thoughts, nothing 
more.” Repeat this phrase over and over, but don’t let it become a new 
compulsion for dealing with your obsessive thoughts!
The point of treating your thoughts this way is that slowly, but surely, you 
can relate to them differently. You can call upon the observant part of you to 
help you step back from your thoughts. Think of your thoughts as analogous 
to having your hand smashed up against your face, blocking your vision. The 
observant you can help you take the hand away, allowing you to see (think) 
more clearly.
Acquiring the Attitudes of Mindfulness
Mindfulness consists of a set of adoptable attitudes, which we describe in 
this section. Once you embrace these attitudes, you can start ever-so-slowly 
to form a new perspective on life that can help you manage your OCD mind 
instead of allowing it to manage you. These ways of thinking can also prepare 
you for mindful meditation. These attitudes are
 
 Making time
 
 Having patience
 
 Letting go
 
 Learning acceptance
 
 Suspending judgment
 
 Living in the now
Making time to be mindful
Adopting mindful attitudes and becoming skilled at mindfulness require you 
to open up some space and time in your life. Simply put, to change, you have 
to want to change, and you have to make time to change.
We can almost hear you saying, “Okay, but I’m awfully busy. Exactly how 
much time will I need to put in on this?” That question actually comes from 
the OCD part of your mind, which doesn’t want you to spend time on things 
that will take you away from your OCD!
In actuality, you don’t need to practice mindfulness for any absolute amount 
of time. If you’re feeling really pressed, try giving mindfulness ten formal 

143
 Chapter 9: Managing the OCD Mind
minutes a day. As you get used to it and it begins to feel more natural, you’ll 
probably find it easier to devote an increasing amount of time to it. Try to 
work up to 30 to 45 minutes a day.
 
If you’re thinking, “Gasp, I could never devote 45 minutes a day to something 
like this,” don’t forget that less time can be helpful too. You can always try 
being mindful for a couple of minutes ten times a day, or develop some similar 
strategy. The more time you spend on being mindful, the less time you will 
be devoting to your OCD. Most people find that if they can reduce their OCD 
by 50 percent or more, a big chunk of time is freed up that was unavailable to 
them before.
Pursuing patience
Humans tend to be a rather impatient lot. But impatience can derail the most 
determined efforts to change. For example, dieters give up on dieting because 
they don’t see results quickly enough — even though studies indicate that 
the more slowly you lose weight, the better you’ll do in the long run. In the 
same way, impatience causes people to stop physical training when they 
can’t observe results after a few weeks.
You simply cannot rush the process of adopting mindful attitudes. An anal-
ogy we like is that of running a long distance race using the wrong motiva-
tion. Somewhere along the way, after running for what seems like an eternity, 
you realize you have not yet reached the finish line. To prod yourself to do 
better and run faster, you start smacking yourself on the head. We hope you 
can see the futility in this approach. It is only by accepting where you’re at 
now that you can move forward.
OCD often devours hours of time and mental energy every day, so it’s very 
understandable that you want quick relief. Be patient. Don’t expect immediate 
balance and absolute well-being after a few days of practicing mindfulness.
Letting go of striving for striving’s sake
In the Western world, and especially in the United States, people tend to 
emphasize hard work and striving for a purpose. The message is usually that 
if you aren’t where you want to be in life, all you have to do is work harder, 
and you’ll get there. Still not getting the results you want? Work even harder. 
Whew! We’re tired just from thinking about it! What about working smarter 
with mindfulness?
Adapting a mindful attitude may feel very strange indeed if you, like most 
people, belong to the “work hard and then work some more” school of thinking. 
Mindfulness just doesn’t happen that way. Rather, unlike almost everything else 

144
Par t III: Overcoming OCD 
you do, mindfulness comes from letting go of working harder. In a sense, you 
want to strive to not strive. You allow mindfulness to come in while allowing 
yourself to let go of striving for striving’s sake.
You could easily conclude that we are suggesting that hard work is a bad 
thing. But that’s not the case at all. For example, the treatment of OCD usu-
ally involves hard, difficult work. Most people will need to participate in some 
type of psychotherapy in order to get better. That means going to sessions, 
talking about difficult topics, and even doing things that may be really hard 
(see Chapters 8 and 10 for more information). But our experience with people 
is that when they work too hard at therapy and become, well, obsessive, then 
progress can be slowed.
Discovering acceptance
Most of our clients start therapy wanting to change something about them-
selves or their world. They come for help because they’re uncomfortable and 
feeling great distress. They want something different in their lives. They want 
to feel better. Although we can help them feel better, we cannot eliminate all 
the bad stuff they will encounter the rest of their lives. If we could do that, 
we’d do it for ourselves first, and then implement world peace!
Certainly, if you suffer from OCD, you want change — change from suffering 
and change from feeling overtaken and overwhelmed. What if we tell you that 
the only way out of suffering is to accept that you will suffer? But the pain of 
your suffering will impact you far less when you practice acceptance.
Life is difficult. If you live a long life, you will necessarily experience pain, 
loss, and sadness. We all do! But, you may wonder, why do some people fall 
apart when bad things happen while others march on or even benefit from 
hardship?
Lots of factors play a role in how people respond to life’s bumps in the road. 
People are made stronger by having supportive family and friends, enjoying 
productive work, and being strong mentally and physically. But something 
else protects against misfortune. People who are shocked and surprised 
when the inevitable obstacle shows up have a harder time handling it than 
do people who acknowledge and anticipate distress. Knowing and accepting 
that some moments in life are going to be uncomfortable, and even expecting 
those moments, make those difficult moments less, well, difficult.
Acceptance means cultivating a willingness to experience life as it comes 
your way. Allow bad feelings in when they arrive, and embrace them. The 
more you fight, the bigger the battle. That is the paradox of acceptance. Thus, 
acceptance is neither pessimistic nor optimistic. Acceptance is realistic.

145
 Chapter 9: Managing the OCD Mind
Okay, enough of the philosophical chatter. Here, in a nutshell, is what accep-
tance has to do with you and your OCD: When you struggle against your own 
thinking, your mind bubbles over with even more obsessive thoughts. This 
means the more you can’t stand to have an obsessive thought, the more 
likely that obsessive thought is to materialize.
Here’s an exercise to make the point clearer. Think of a pink elephant. Bright 
pink, big, and fat. Concentrate. Picture that big, fat, pink elephant in your 
mind. Now, stop. Stop thinking about that pink elephant. Think about paying 
your bills or something. Seriously, we mean it! Whatever you do, don’t think 
about that elephant. Don’t let any thought of pink elephants enter your mind 
for the rest of the day. Tell yourself that the absolute worst thing you can do 
is think about pink elephants.
Did it work? Did you succeed in having absolutely no thoughts about that 
pink elephant? Probably not. That’s because it is pretty hard to stop yourself 
from thinking. Active attempts to suppress thoughts usually boomerang.
By contrast, when you accept your thoughts for what they are — just 
thoughts — they lose some of their stranglehold over your OCD mind and 
dissipate more quickly. See, you’ve probably already stopped thinking about 
that pink elephant. Oh, sorry.
 
Mind you, acquiring acceptance takes time. Most humans will never be fully 
and readily accepting of whatever happens to them 100 percent of the time. 
For example, if you suffer a serious loss, we aren’t suggesting that you simply 
accept the loss and instantly move on. That’s not fair. Rather, it’s important to 
accept the grief into your life. Feel it, observe it, and don’t try to push it away. 
This approach will gradually guide you toward a healthy resolution of the loss. 
If you try to simply squelch difficult thoughts and feelings (whether related to 
loss or OCD), they will hang around far longer. Acceptance acknowledges the 
loss, the grief, and the lessening of the pain over time.
Suspending judgment about emotions
The vast majority of OCD thoughts that produce difficult emotions, such as 
anxiety, distress, sadness, stress, and controllable urges, include making 
strong judgments about the thought or events. The powerful emotions 
brought on by these judgments frequently trigger troubling episodes of OCD. 
The process is cyclical and looks something like this:
 
1. A thought enters your awareness or an event occurs.
 
2. You make an OCD-biased judgment about the thought or event.
 
3. Your judgment of the thought or event triggers an emotion.
 
4. You make an OCD-biased judgment about the emotion.

146
Par t III: Overcoming OCD 
 
5. Your judgment of the emotion triggers OCD behavior.
 
6. As it says on the shampoo bottle, lather, rinse, and repeat. . . .
With practice, you can learn to release judgments and harsh evaluations of 
yourself and the world. Here are a few common OCD-related judgments and 
evaluations of the self and the world that you may want to watch for so that 
you can defend yourself against them:
 
 I am a defective person who must always be on the lookout. Otherwise, I 
am bound to seriously harm or kill someone.
 
 I could never forgive myself if I failed to keep my kitchen 100 percent 
clean and someone in my family came down with food poisoning.
 
 If I mess up in any way at all, I am a truly horrible person.
 
 No sane person would ever have thoughts like mine. I’m a disaster!
So how do you defend yourself against these kinds of judgments and evalua-
tions? As an alternative, try realizing that all humans are an incredibly mixed 
bag of actions that can be judged positively or negatively. We’re not saying 
that people are not responsible for intentional, immoral, illegal, and unkind 
actions. However, devoting much of your time to negatively judging yourself 
or others only makes you miserable and provides further fuel for your OCD 
mind. As Forrest Gump said, “Stuff happens!” When it does, remember that 
emotions are neither right nor wrong — they just are.
 
Please realize that suspending judgment and acquiring self-acceptance is an 
ever-evolving process. As with all mindful attitudes, you’ll never achieve per-
fection with it. But that’s okay, because considerable research has shown that 
people who struggle for perfection wind up feeling much worse than those 
who can accept themselves as they are.
 
Try to avoid judging your attempts at becoming nonjudgmental! Of course 
you will make many slips along the way. Just remember that no one is keeping 
score — other than the OCD part of your mind.
Living in the now
Everyone tends to worry now and then about things that haven’t happened, 
and in many cases never will. For those with OCD, this kind of worrying is 
persistent, with one thought leading to another. What if I lose my job? What 
if that table is contaminated? What if I can’t control myself? Or, you may feel 
guilty or depressed about what has happened in the past. Why did I say or do 
that? I wish I could go back in my life and do something better with my rela-
tionships. If only my childhood had been better.

 Chapter 9: Managing the OCD Mind
Even though we write lots of books on how to think better, we’re not always 
masters of our thoughts. Much of the time when we’re thinking, we’re not 
focused on the here and now. Instead, we’re somewhere else in time, often in 
the future. But we’re always aware that we are living in the here and now, and 
that we’re not time-traveling in our thoughts.
If you suffer with OCD, thinking about the future can feel like being in the future. 
This can lead to experiencing the emotion of dread toward the future, even 
though the event has not and may not occur. So, if today is sunny and warm, yet 
you are focused on tomorrow’s forecast of cold and rain, you miss the joy of the 
good day that is and experience the dread of the rainy day that may or may not 
actually occur. After all, the TV weather people are not infallible!
The following example is taken from our own experience and illustrates what 
focusing on anticipated dread versus present moments does:
Friday mornings we travel down the road to a small gym near our home. 
There, we are met by our personal torturer, uh, we mean personal trainer. 
All the way there in the car we gripe about how early it is and how we 
didn’t have enough coffee. Our minds are spinning and spewing negative 
thoughts. We begin to conjecture. What if
 
• She makes us go up on our weights this time?
 
• She makes us stand on one leg and twist into a pretzel?
 
• We fall over and everyone laughs?
 
• We have to jump rope for three minutes and can only do two?
 
• We stop breathing and die?
Still, when we arrive at the gym, we drag ourselves out of the car, con-
tinuing to dread what is coming next.
Our trainer greets us, smiling. “Hi, I’ve been taking some great continu-
ing education classes. I’ve got some new routines that involve abs, core 
strength, triceps, and biceps. Oh yeah, and the gluteus too!”
Oh goodie, we think.
But, then something happens. As we give ourselves to the magic of rig-
orous, physical exercise, within just a couple of minutes, the dreadful 
thoughts disappear. Attention focuses purely on how to balance, coor-
dinate, and sustain the muscles necessary to complete each set. The 
“now” we are experiencing is really not that bad, and its aim is to keep 
us healthy. The mind calms. After the workout, smiles and happy moods 
prevail. See you next week!
This example from our own lives shows you how absurdly self-defeating 
thoughts about the future are typically poor predictors of actual experience 
(like those faulty weather reporters). The OCD mind is particularly good at 
this kind of catastrophic thinking about the future.

148
Par t III: Overcoming OCD 
However, the mind becomes still when you fully engage with the present 
moment and live in the now. When you pay attention — full attention — to 
what is in front of you rather than what is behind you or ahead of you, your 
mind fully engages in the now.
Minding Meditation
Acquiring mindful attitudes (see the preceding sections) greatly enhances 
your ability to engage in what’s known as meditation. Both being mindful and 
practicing meditation can help relieve your OCD.
OCD involves intolerance of distress, discomfort, urges, and uncertainty. 
Meditation teaches you to tolerate these frustrations. Meditation also 
increases your concentration and helps OCD sufferers view intrusive 
thoughts as less important.
The really great thing about meditation is that it’s not especially complicated 
or expensive — you don’t even need formal lessons or classes, although 
many people find them helpful. You can get started just by setting aside a few 
minutes each day.
There are many types of meditation. You may be instructed to focus on a 
candle or pay attention to each breath. Some forms of meditation ask you to 
concentrate on your body as you walk. Yoga is considered by many to be a 
type of meditation.
Which form of meditation is the best one for OCD? No one knows, and 
we rather suspect almost any one of them will work as well as any other. 
Although large studies on meditation for OCD are lacking, we think future 
studies will ultimately demonstrate that meditation works for OCD. We show 
you the basics of two easy-to-learn forms in the next two sections.
 
One form of meditation uses mantras (a word, phrase, or meaningless sound 
that you repeat over and over in order to focus and block out thoughts). You 
can use this approach to meditation, but if you do, be sure not to use it in 
direct response to an obsession. If you do, you run some risk of the mantra 
becoming a type of compulsion — in other words, something you feel com-
pelled to do in order to reduce the distress brought on by your obsession. 
Definitely not something we recommend for those with OCD.
Breathing meditation
Breathing meditation is a common type of meditation. We recommend you do 
this one while sitting down in the following manner:

149
 Chapter 9: Managing the OCD Mind
 
 Find someplace pleasant where you will be undisturbed. This place can 
be inside or outside. Quiet is nice too, but less important than finding a 
place where you won’t be interrupted.
 
 Find something to sit on. Many people choose to purchase formal mats 
and pillows called zabutans and zafus for their meditation. But you can 
also use a chair or couch.
 
 Experiment with a sitting position. You can assume any of quite a 
few different postures while meditating — nothing is especially magi-
cal about any of them. Try to maintain the posture you choose for a 
period of time. Practice remaining still. Not many people find this easy 
to do, but you’ll get better with practice. Physical training and/or yoga 
are great for strengthening your body so that you can remain still for 
increasing amounts of time.
 
 Invite all feelings in, including discomfort. Yep, that’s right. Notice 
little feelings of unease, discomfort, anxiety, obsessions, and urges. Sit 
with them a while. Stay connected with these feelings, and try not to 
judge them. You’ll see over time that you can tolerate these feelings 
longer and longer if you don’t evaluate them as “horrible” or “awful.”
 
 Allow whatever thoughts you have to go through your mind — 
including your obsessions. Some people think meditation involves block-
ing thoughts out. But meditation actually teaches you to relate to your 
thoughts differently — dispassionately observing them rather than taking 
them so seriously. So if you hear an obsession or other negative thought 
calling, just notice the thought. Allow it to pass, as eventually it will.
 
 Don’t hold onto positive thoughts. Everyone enjoys positive thoughts, 
but this instruction involves just noticing your positive thoughts. They 
too will pass, and that’s okay.
 
 Focus on your breathing. Notice the air as it passes through your nose 
and down into your lungs. Take slow, deep breaths. Allow the tension 
in your muscles to release. Let go of any tightness you sense. Scan your 
entire body and allow it to relax. Let your eyes and face soften.
 
 Be kind and accepting of yourself. Realize that no one finds meditation 
immediately rewarding and beneficial. If you struggle with meditation, 
give it more time. You can take a class later if it continues to be difficult. 
Results come slowly. But studies show it has benefits well beyond OCD. 
Improvements may occur in blood pressure, chronic pain, anxiety, and 
general health.
 
Engaging in regular meditation enhances the mindful attitudes discussed in 
the previous sections. And mindful attitudes aid your efforts with meditation.
 
In a few cases, people find that meditation triggers especially troubling feel-
ings, such as anxiety or panic. Although meditative practices call for allowing 
and noticing difficult feelings, don’t let things get out of hand. If you find the 
approach too disturbing, stop immediately! You still may want to learn 

150
Par t III: Overcoming OCD 
meditation, but in these cases, you should get assistance from a mental-health 
professional who is also trained in meditation. This distressing reaction is less 
common with walking meditation, described next.
Walking meditation
Consider observing people scurrying about on a busy sidewalk or in a shop-
ping mall. Notice how they rush to and fro. Take a glance at their faces and 
bodies — furrowed brows, tense foreheads, and arms swinging wildly. Many 
folks rush through their days, never noticing their own keyed-up states.
Mindful walking meditation can help you let go and refocus. Walking medita-
tion is probably one of the easiest meditation methods around, so it’s often a 
good way to start. And the great thing is that you can do it almost anywhere. 
Here’s how walking meditation works:
 
1. Pause for a moment before you start, and take a deep breath. Focus on 
the air as it flows through your nose and lungs.
 
2. Start walking. The pace doesn’t matter much, but don’t rush.
 
3. Focus on the sensations in your body as you walk. Pay attention to 
your leg muscles, feet, thighs, ankles, calves, and the rhythmic swinging 
of your arms.
 
 If thoughts, obsessions, or bad feelings intrude, allow some space for 
them. Notice those thoughts and feelings, but do not judge them. When 
you can, shift your focus back to the sensations in your body.
 
4. Concentrate on your feet for a while. Focus on how they strike the 
ground as your heel hits first, your foot rolls, and you use your toes and 
the ball of your foot to push off. Just notice these sensations.
 
 Again, thoughts, obsessions, and bad feelings are welcome. Do not judge 
them negatively.
 
5. Focus again on the flow of air as you breathe. Inhale slowly and exhale 
as you notice the rhythm of your breath.
 
6. Focus on any sights, smells, or sounds that you encounter on your 
walk. Do this without judgment or evaluation.
 
7. Shift your focus back to the muscles in your body and the rhythm of 
your walking.
 
 If any of your obsessions come in, allow and notice them, but resist 
acting on them. You can tell yourself that when the walking meditation 
is over, you can engage in a compulsion if you feel you must — but con-
tinue the walking for at least 15 minutes.

151
 Chapter 9: Managing the OCD Mind
That’s it. Consider practicing walking meditation every day for 15 or 20 min-
utes. The exercise from the walking can’t hurt, and the meditation is likely to 
help you.
The “Four R’s” approach
Jeffrey M. Schwartz, M.D., began working 
with OCD patients at the U.C.L.A. School of 
Medicine in the mid 1980s. In a book he coau-
thored with Sharon Bagley, The Mind and the 
Brain: Neuroplasticity and the Power of Mental 
Force, Schwartz expressed concerns about 
what he considered to be the highly distress-
ing and objectionable nature of exposure and 
response prevention (ERP) therapy, “. . . with its 
visits to public toilets and patients wiping urine-
impregnated paper over themselves.” As an 
alternative to ERP, Schwartz and his team devel-
oped what they call the “Four R’s” approach 
to OCD treatment. He considers his approach 
to be cognitive-behavioral, with an emphasis 
on mindfulness techniques. He describes this 
treatment in the previously mentioned book as 
well as in Brain Lock (both published by Harper 
Perennial). The Four R’s approach consists of 
four steps, as follows:
 1. Relabel: When you have a compulsion or 
an obsession, you want to label it as exactly 
that — an obsession or a compulsion at 
work. Thus, if you touch something and fear 
getting AIDS from it, you need to remind 
yourself that the thought is an obsession.
 2. Reattribute: When you notice an obsession 
or a compulsion, you not only realize that it 
is an obsession or compulsion, but you also 
tell yourself that it is being generated by 
faulty wiring and chemicals in your brain.
 3. Refocus: After you have relabeled and reat-
tributed, make a decision to focus on some-
thing else, such as reading a book, taking 
a walk, or playing a game. The key in this 
part of the program is that you delay any 
compulsive act at least 15 minutes.
 4. Revalue: This step slowly evolves from 
repeatedly going through Steps 1 through 3. 
Dr. Schwartz advises that you can become 
an impartial, nonjudgmental observer of 
your mind. Over time, you can come to real-
ize that your obsessions and compulsions 
are not who you are, but merely stem from 
your OCD mind. You will come to see that 
your obsessions and compulsions have no 
actual value for you. They are the equiva-
lent of brain junk and ought to be ignored.
Dr. Schwartz’s program has generated a lot of 
excitement, and we also see it as quite inter-
esting and promising. We do, however, have 
reservations about abandoning ERP totally and 
replacing it with the Four R’s as some have sug-
gested, for the following reasons:
  Large, randomized, controlled studies 
supporting the effectiveness of the Four 
R’s treatment are lacking, unlike other 
approaches for OCD, such as ERP, medica-
tion, and cognitive therapy.
  The Four R’s plan actually includes a few 
elements of exposure and, ultimately, 
response prevention.
  ERP as usually practiced only rarely 
requires some of the horrid, more extreme 
exposures Dr. Schwartz describes.

152
Par t III: Overcoming OCD 
 
There is no absolute, correct way to do breathing or walking meditation. You 
can experiment with varying what you decide to focus on, but generally you 
want to concentrate on bodily sensations and your breath. Finally, with medi-
tation, you do not want to block out thoughts, including obsessions. Rather, 
you want to relate to them differently, by allowing them to come in and pass 
through as they will.

Chapter 10
Tackling OCD Behavior with ERP
In This Chapter
 Understanding exposure and response prevention (ERP)
 Executing ERP
 Troubleshooting ERP
O
ver the past 30 years or so, we’ve consulted with clients who previ-
ously had received many years of treatment for their OCD — including 
various medications, all types of psychotherapy, and even electroconvulsive 
shock therapy — to virtually no avail. Sometimes OCD had not been correctly 
assessed and diagnosed. Other times the diagnosis was on target, but the 
therapies and medications were ill-chosen. A few of these cases had even been 
described as hopeless, and family members had been told to expect a lifetime 
of serious disability, if not institutionalization. We’re happy to report that we 
were able to provide significant relief for the vast majority of these cases.
Fortunately, in recent years the outlook for OCD clients has been improving. 
Many more mental-health professionals are aware of how to recognize OCD 
and accurately diagnose it, as well as which treatments work and which ones 
don’t. Of the available treatments for OCD, the specific type of Cognitive-
Behavioral Therapy (CBT) called exposure and response prevention (ERP) 
stands as the most widely researched and accepted treatment strategy.
In this chapter, we explain what ERP is, why it works, and how to implement this 
strategy. Unless your OCD is very mild, you will want to collaborate with a pro-
fessional in using ERP. In fact, it may be best to consult with a therapist before 
using ERP alone in any case. This chapter lays out the essentials and can help 
you prepare to work with your therapist. See Chapter 7 for information about 
seeking the services of a professional with appropriate training in ERP.
Exposing the Basics and Benefits of ERP
Don’t panic! The “exposure” part of ERP doesn’t mean we’re going to suggest 
that you take off your clothes and walk around in public nude — that’s not 

154
Par t III: Overcoming OCD 
what ERP is about! But exposure is involved. ERP is pretty straightforward, 
and can be broken out into two parts:
 
 Exposure: The exposure part of ERP involves putting yourself in contact 
with the situations, cues, events, and triggers that lead to your obsessional 
fears (frequently recurring thoughts, images, or urges that are unwanted 
and cause considerable distress). For example, if you fear touching 
numerous everyday objects like telephones, doorknobs, and kitchen 
counters, you’re asked to gradually start touching these feared surfaces.
 
 As you make contact with these triggers, you’re asked to pay close atten-
tion to how you feel, which will likely involve some distress. However, 
that distress will diminish as you continue making contact. In fact, you 
will be expected to repeatedly come in contact with these triggers and 
cues until your distress does diminish. It may take a while for you to feel 
better, but you will.
 
 Response prevention: The response prevention part of ERP simply 
refers to resisting the urge to engage in or carry out your usual com-
pulsions (behaviors or mental acts that you use to reduce the distress 
caused by an obsession) in response to the discomfort you feel from 
making contact with the triggers. In the preceding example, after touch-
ing objects, you’re likely to want to wash your hands (a compulsion), 
but while practicing ERP, you’re instructed to work very hard to avoid 
hand-washing.
The description of ERP initially may sound like we’re simply saying, “Just 
stop having your obsessions and compulsions!” We understand that reaction. 
But we suspect if you could, you would have already stopped your OCD.
So how is ERP more than an instruction to “just stop”? Well, with ERP you are 
carefully guided to systematically — slowly but surely — make contact with 
your problematic triggers while gradually building up your ability to resist 
engaging in your compulsions.
 
It seems to us that psychologists are pretty much addicted to acronyms, but 
they don’t particularly agree on which ones to use. Exposure and response 
prevention is sometimes referred to as ERP, but you may also see acronyms 
such as E&RP, EX/RP, and ERPT used to refer to the same thing. Occasionally, 
you may see the terms Behavior Therapy (BT) or Cognitive-Behavioral 
Therapy (CBT) used to refer to ERP, but those are actually much more general 
types of therapy that may or may not include ERP.
Understanding why and how ERP works
People learn best through repeated, direct experience and practice. The 
more times you do something, the more ingrained the learning becomes. 
Your OCD is well practiced and deeply ingrained. ERP helps you unlearn your 

155
 Chapter 10: Tackling OCD Behavior with ERP
OCD behaviors by reconditioning your responses to an increasing hierarchy, 
or staircase, of stimuli (triggers). You start with the least problematic trigger 
and progress to the most challenging one.
Ringing in change with ERP
In the late 1890s, a Russian scientist by the name of Ivan Pavlov conducted 
experiments that demonstrated a learning principle that helps explain how 
ERP works. Pavlov noticed that dogs begin to salivate upon seeing the person 
who normally feeds them. He then decided to see if he could teach the dogs 
to associate the same response with the sound of a bell (something that dogs 
would normally never salivate in response to). He rang a bell and closely 
followed the sound with giving the dogs food. Soon the dogs began to drool 
merely in response to the bell — even without receiving food. Even more 
importantly, he discovered that this response could be unlearned (essen-
tially, that the association could be broken) by repeatedly sounding the bell 
over and over again without following the sound with food.
Humans also have used dinner bells for centuries to announce that dinner 
is ready. The users of dinner bells find that they, like Pavlov’s dogs, begin 
to salivate in response to the bell — and sometimes even bells other than 
dinner bells. But if someone continuously rang bells with no food to follow, 
humans would also unlearn the response.
The first principle of why ERP works is based on this same idea. The triggers, 
cues, situations, and events (what shrinks call stimuli) that set off your obses-
sions and compulsions have a powerful negative emotional charge — in other 
words, you associate them with great distress. So if touching a doorknob trig-
gers an obsession about contamination, you feel freaked out. Just looking at a 
doorknob may even make you feel upset.
However, if you make repeated, prolonged contact with doorknobs, you can 
actually unlearn this association. The association is broken or unlearned 
because the anticipated horrible outcome doesn’t occur. In other words, you 
hold onto the doorknob until your freaked-out feelings diminish — and they 
will with enough time and repetition.
 
It may take you a while to believe that nothing bad will happen during expo-
sure to fearful, distressing stimuli — which is why many, if not most, people 
need some assistance in going through ERP.
Reconditioning behavior with ERP
For those people who have both obsessions and compulsions (the vast 
majority of those with OCD), an additional principle explains why ERP works. 
That principle is known as reinforcement. Reinforcement refers to the fact 
that people tend to do more of almost anything that makes them feel better 
(see Chapter 5 for a more detailed explanation of both positive and negative 
reinforcement). Thus, if what you do results in either pleasurable feelings or 

156
Par t III: Overcoming OCD 
marked reductions in anxiety or distress, you have a strong incentive to keep 
doing more of what leads you to these feelings.
Compulsions are powerfully reinforced because they temporarily make you 
feel better. ERP therapy instructs you not to carry out your compulsions so 
that your brain won’t remain stuck in the OCD loop of an obsession causing 
distress and a compulsion reducing that distress, which reinforces the cycle.
See Chapter 4 for a description of how the brains of those with OCD differ a 
little from the brains of those without OCD. In OCD, certain brain areas are 
enlarged and others show increased activity. Particularly exciting research 
shows that ERP (as well as medications) can restore these alterations to 
normal. Remind yourself repeatedly that with each ERP trial, you are literally 
rewiring and normalizing the way your brain works. That’s actually the best 
incentive we can give you for undergoing ERP.
Seeing the upsides and downsides of ERP
ERP has been extensively studied as a treatment for OCD since the 1970s. 
These studies have consistently demonstrated that ERP is highly effective as 
a treatment for OCD, as long as the patient stays the course.
The major downside of ERP (and it’s significant) is that it has a moderately 
high dropout and/or refusal rate. Some people just won’t consider doing ERP, 
and others drop out after they start. Combining cognitive therapy or medica-
tion with ERP appears to reduce the rate of refusal, but it’s unclear whether 
fewer people ultimately drop out of such combined treatments. More studies 
are needed on this issue.
However, the positives of ERP, when you follow through, are many. Here are 
the major findings at this time:
 
 ERP appears to be at least as effective as medication and may be even 
more so, although the literature on this issue is mixed. A combination of 
ERP and medication does not lead to dramatic improvements over either 
one alone, but is generally recommended for those with severe cases.
 
 The effectiveness of ERP appears to be similar to that of other CBT tech-
niques for OCD (see Chapter 8 and 9), but those techniques have not 
been studied as extensively. Furthermore, most studies of CBT for OCD 
to date have included at least some component of ERP. And ERP usu-
ally has a few elements of CBT. Therefore, the jury is still out regarding 
the overall comparable effectiveness of CBT alone for OCD or, for that 
matter, ERP with no other elements of CBT.
 
 ERP can be done in a therapist’s office or in a patient’s home environment. 
There’s no rule as to which works better, but our clinical impression is that 
home applications sometimes appear useful.

157
 Chapter 10: Tackling OCD Behavior with ERP
 
 ERP usually works better when guidance is provided by a trained 
professional. However, self-directed ERP seems to work fairly well for 
some people, especially those with mild cases.
 
 ERP works better than psychological treatments aimed only at anxiety 
reduction (like progressive muscle relaxation and deep-breathing 
techniques).
 
 ERP works over the long term, and those who practice it appear to resist 
relapse for a number of years (if not longer). By contrast, medication 
alone leads to rapid relapse if discontinued.
Exploring an alternative when 
ERP isn’t appropriate
Real-life exposure generally works best whenever carrying it out is practical. 
However, a lot of people with OCD experience obsessive thoughts or images 
having to do with worries about engaging in violent, inappropriate, danger-
ous, or immoral behaviors. For example, some people with OCD obsess about 
shouting obscenities out loud and compulsively chant to prevent them from 
losing control. ERP would not have those people shout obscenities at a reli-
gious service.
Obviously, exposure is inappropriate when obsessions have to do with horri-
ble or socially inappropriate things, such as murder, rape, or doing something 
indecent in public. However, another approach to exposure can be used for 
these kinds of problems. This alternative is called imaginal exposure.
 
A very small percentage of those with OCD report experiencing obsessive 
thoughts without any compulsive mental or behavioral actions. Some of these 
people may have horrible images of hurting someone else without any com-
pulsive actions to keep them from doing so. Imaginal exposure also can work 
for this issue when regular exposure would be impractical.
Imaginal exposure strategies include:
 
 Scripts: With this approach, you write out a vivid story about your obses-
sions. For example, you might write out a scene involving catching a 
terrible disease from eating contaminated food. Or, if your OCD theme is 
about harming other people, your script might include detailed descrip-
tions of you losing control and doing what you fear, such as stabbing all 
your family members to death. The scripts are usually one to five minutes 
in length. Scripts should be listened to or read multiple times.
 
 Video: Sometimes you can find a scene closely related to your OCD 
theme from a horror movie that you can play repeatedly.

158
Par t III: Overcoming OCD 
 
 Imaginal hierarchies: You can also arrange a set of specific scenes into 
a hierarchy, or staircase. You proceed with imagining each stair on your 
hierarchy again and again until your Ugh Factor Ratings drop substan-
tially. Then you move onto the next stair on your hierarchy. (We discuss 
hierarchies, staircases, and Ugh Factor Ratings later in this chapter.)
 
If your obsessions are highly disturbing and include themes about harming 
yourself or others, engaging in violence, or doing illegal activities, we strongly 
recommend that you consult a therapist. Although those with OCD are at lower 
risk than most people for actually engaging in such behavior, you need a mental-
health professional to assess your risks and provide an actual diagnosis.
Working through ERP Therapy
Setting up and working through ERP involves a series of five steps. Although 
you can read most of this book in any order you want, if you’re ready to con-
sider ERP, we recommend you start with Step 1 and proceed through Step 5. 
Most people find going through ERP is easier when working with a therapist.
 
1. Find your OCD theme.
 
2. List your OCD triggers and their Ugh Factor Ratings.
 
3. Build an ERP staircase.
 
4. Warm up to ERP.
 
5. Work through your triggers by doing ERP.
Determining your OCD theme
Although obsessions and compulsions vary widely from one person to another, 
in almost all cases, OCD consists of one or more unifying themes or subjects. 
These themes are often referred to as OCD types (see Chapter 2 for more spe-
cific information). The most frequent themes are fears and worries about:
 
 Collecting and hoarding
 
 Contamination
 
 Doing something inappropriate (usually sexual or aggressive)
 
 Doubts (or checking)
 
 Physical health
 
 Sinning
 
 Symmetry

159
 Chapter 10: Tackling OCD Behavior with ERP
The first step in ERP is to determine the main theme or type of your OCD. 
That isn’t difficult to do. Simply review the list above and/or look through 
Chapter 2 and find the types of OCD concerns that give you the most trouble. 
You may identify more than one.
Because contamination is the most common OCD theme, we focus on it in 
this chapter as well as the previous two. However, you will see these same 
principles applied to other OCD themes in Chapters 13–19. So don’t feel left 
out if your OCD theme is a little different — we’re likely to have you covered.
Tallying up your OCD triggers and 
assigning Ugh Factor Ratings
Once you know the theme or themes surrounding your obsessional thoughts 
and worries, the next step is to look for all the triggers, actions, events, cues, 
and situations (also known as stimuli) that set your whole OCD cycle off. These 
triggers include a variety of situations that you probably avoid much of the 
time right now. For instance, if your obsessional theme is contamination, you 
may stay away from public bathrooms or avoid touching doorknobs, dirt, 
kitchen counters, or telephones. A trigger is something that sets off your desire 
to use a compulsion (like washing your hands) if you encounter it.
 
The nature of a given person’s OCD may involve triggers that don’t lend them-
selves to standard ERP in real-life situations. For example, someone who fears 
exposure to radioactive material would not be encouraged to actually take a 
field trip to the national labs at Los Alamos, New Mexico, and walk into a room 
labeled: “Warning! Highly Radioactive Material Inside!” If your OCD involves 
impractical triggers like this example, see the earlier section, “Exploring an 
alternative when ERP isn’t appropriate.”
After you’ve made your list of problematic OCD triggers, actions, cues, 
events, and situations, rate each one for the amount of difficulty it would 
cause you if you were to make contact with it. We like to whimsically call 
these Ugh Factor Ratings. We like to use Ugh Factor Ratings because the word 
“Ugh” captures the essence of distress and upset.
 
The technical term that most psychologists use is Subjective Units of Distress 
or SUDS. Only psychologists would come up with an acronym like SUDS. These 
ratings are personal and arbitrary — basically, good guesses. SUDS sounds 
important, but it just means a good guesstimate.

160
Par t III: Overcoming OCD 
Here are the steps to follow for listing and rating your OCD triggers.
 
1. Make a list of about 10 to 20 distressing situations — the events, cues, 
actions, and triggers for your OCD.
 
 All items in your list should relate to your particular OCD theme, such as 
contamination. Make a separate list for each theme or type of OCD you 
struggle with. As you create your list, consider the following guidelines:
 
• Include situations that you normally completely avoid, but that 
would upset you if you were to encounter them. Thus, if you never 
go into public restrooms (and you fear doing so), that would go on 
your list.
 
• Try to include items on your list that vary in the difficulty they 
would cause you if you were to make contact with them. Have 
several relatively easy items, a few that would cause you moderate 
distress, and some that would be very difficult.
 
• Don’t include items that would require almost no effort at all 
(those with an Ugh Factor Rating below 20 or 25).
 
• Unless you’re working with a professional therapist, do not include 
items that someone without OCD would probably be unwilling to 
do. For example, most people would be pretty reluctant to touch 
the inside of a dumpster or the inside of a public toilet.
 
2. Go through your list and give each item an Ugh Factor Rating on a 0 to 
100 point scale of difficulty.
 
 On this scale, a 0 indicates that you would anticipate no distress what-
soever, while a 100 indicates that nothing imaginable could cause more 
distress. Thus, a 25 would cause you mild distress, a 50 would start feel-
ing intense, and a 75 would set off strong negative feelings.
Gil’s story illustrates the process of making a list of OCD triggers related to con-
tamination fears and assigning an Ugh Factor Rating to each item on the list.
Gil is a 19-year-old college student majoring in physics. Since he was 
about 10 years old, Gil has worried about germs and becoming ill, and he 
fears exposure to all kinds of possible environmental toxins. Through an 
ad in the school newspaper, he discovers that the student mental-health 
clinic on his campus happens to have a clinic for treating OCD. Gil recog-
nizes himself in the ad’s description of OCD, and makes an appointment 
at the clinic. A therapist interviews him carefully, gives him some ques-
tionnaires about OCD and concludes that Gil indeed has OCD.
The therapist then suggests that Gil list his problematic OCD triggers 
(events, situations, and cues). He recommends that Gil rate each item on 
his list in terms of the Ugh Factor. Table 10-1 shows Gil’s list and associ-
ated Ugh Factor Ratings.

Gil’s therapist is pleased with his list and Ugh Factor Ratings. However, 
the therapist notices that there are no items in the range between 30 and 
50. Because that’s quite a jump, they work together to come up with two 
items that are a little tougher than a 30 and easier than a 50 — specifi-
cally, shaking hands (40) and checking out at the grocery store (45).
Gil’s list is typical of someone with the OCD theme of contamination. Now 
he’s ready to turn his list and ratings into an ERP staircase.
 
Each person’s list will differ both in content and Ugh Factor Ratings. For 
example, one person with contamination fears may not feel any distress at all 
in touching doorknobs while someone else may dread doing so. Compiling 
your list and rating each item is likely to take you a little time and creativity — 
don’t rush the process.
 
Developing and rating your list can cause anxiety. In a way, that’s good 
because the process actually represents the beginning of the exposure task — 
just writing down the items and rating them is a type of exposure. However, if 
you experience overwhelming anxiety, get professional assistance.

162
Par t III: Overcoming OCD 
Placing your OCD triggers 
on an ERP staircase
Now it’s time to take your OCD triggers and construct an OCD exposure stair-
case. Look for the item with the lowest Ugh Factor Rating and put it on the 
bottom stair, as illustrated in Figure 10-1. Continue to fill in the staircase with 
items, progressing from the least difficult on the bottom stair to the most dif-
ficult on the top stair. See Appendix B for a blank staircase form for your use, 
and feel free to make extra copies as the need arises.
 
Steps in your staircase should have reasonably even spacing between them in 
terms of their Ugh Factor Ratings. So if you have two steps that are more than 
10 or 15 Ugh Rating points apart, try to come up with another one to place in 
between them. Try breaking a difficult item into two or three parts. For exam-
ple, if the thought of touching the doorknob of a health clinic feels terrifying, 
consider starting with a glove on. Then work up to touching the knob with the 
back of your hand — anything that makes it easier, so long as you keep going 
after you master the easier item.
 
If you are trying ERP on your own, you definitely want to use a carefully con-
structed staircase, one step at a time. However, if you are working with an 
experienced professional with ERP, you may find that a formal staircase (also 
called a hierarchy) may not be utilized. If the therapist determines you can do 
it, a more fluid, rapid approach is sometimes employed.
In Figure 10-1, Gil’s OCD triggers from the preceding section have been 
turned into an OCD exposure staircase.

 Chapter 10: Tackling OCD Behavior with ERP
Now that Gil has his staircase in hand, he’s ready to start climbing his stairs. 
Well, almost ready. First, he has to look out for the responses (compulsions) 
he usually tries to use as a way to reduce his distress. (We address this later 
in the section “Preventing the response to compulsions.”) But before we 
move on to compulsions, you should know that variability exists within each 
OCD contamination type or theme.
Seeing variations on the contamination theme
Some people with the contamination type of OCD worry about germs from 
dirty surfaces. Others have fears about environmental contaminants. The 
actual content of each person’s hierarchy, or staircase, will vary somewhat, 
not only due to having slightly different themes, but also because each OCD 
mind is unique in what it chooses to fear. The following example illustrates a 
staircase for someone concerned about toxins.
Corwin has always tended to be anxious. Some of her friends have teased 
her in the past about her obsessive concerns regarding toxic chemicals. 
Corwin stays away from pesticides, uses environmentally friendly clean-
ing products, and refuses to microwave her food. She has trouble keeping 
a job because of her excessive concern about toxins. She even carries her 
own paper products that have been produced organically without expo-
sure to “unnatural chemicals.”
Corwin takes a new job at a busy call center. She enjoys talking to the 
customers, but the stress of her new position starts to get to her. She 
finds herself thinking more and more about what contaminants she 
might pick up at work. She has always cleaned her headset with her 
spray bottle of alcohol before putting it on — not to eliminate germs or 
viruses, but because she believes the alcohol removes toxic fumes from 
the plastic — at least for a little while. Now she is beginning to feel the 
need to spray the headset many times a day. She’s also starting to worry 
about getting sick from using a phone all day. She imagines that the 
phone puts out some kind of toxic radio waves.
One day she observes the cleaning crew using harsh chemicals to clean 
the employee bathroom. She begins to worry about the chemical con-
taminants pulsing through the air. Her ability to concentrate on the job is 
decreasing by the minute. On the day she wears a surgical mask to work 
(to avoid breathing in imagined toxins from cleaning supplies), her super-
visor asks her to come to his office to discuss the problem.
Rather than get fired again, Corwin decides to get help for her OCD. 
Figure 10-2 shows her staircase.

Corwin’s

Touching my desk without wiping off toxins (70 Ugh Factor Rating)
Eating snack food from the machine in the break room (75 Ugh Factor Rating)

Using the toilet paper from the employee restroom (75 Ugh Factor Rating)
Using a headset without cleaning to remove toxins (90 Ugh Factor Rating)
Eating a donut from the employee lounge (95 Ugh Factor Rating)
As you can see, Corwin’s staircase is quite different from Gil’s. A couple of 
the items actually look rather similar to Gil’s, but the underlying obsessional 
worry has to do with fear of toxins rather than viruses and germs, as is the 
case for Gil.
Preventing the response to compulsions
When you look at your staircase, your first reaction will likely be “Ugh.” 
That’s perfectly normal. Ask yourself what you want to do when you see 
those stairs. Most people feel compelled to engage in a compulsion when an 
obsessive worry is activated. Compulsions come in two forms:
 
 Actions: Examples include washing your hands, spraying disinfectants, 
touching or moving in a certain way, or arranging things in a certain order.
 
 Mental acts: Examples include counting, praying, chanting, or having 
certain good thoughts.
Are toxins OCD or real?
Global warming, greenhouse gases, pesticides, 
Escherichia coli (E. coli) in the food supply, air 
pollution — all represent legitimate concerns. 
People get sick and die from environmental con-
taminants. So when do normal concerns about 
toxins cross the line into OCD? You probably 
don’t want to hear this, but there is no absolute, 
definitive line. Perhaps some people viewed 
Al Gore as a little OCD when he began to rail 
against the dangers of global warming. Others 
thought he was visionary, and today most of the 
scientific community sees him as the latter.
Al Gore’s interest in the environment was pas-
sionate, welcomed, and under his deliberate 
control — all signs that he wasn’t suffering 
from OCD. If your concerns are based on clear 
warning signs or a body of consistent, scientific 
evidence, they probably don’t constitute OCD. 
On the other hand, if your concerns feel out of 
your control, highly disturbing, life disrupting, 
and intrusive, they are more likely to be indica-
tive of OCD.

165
 Chapter 10: Tackling OCD Behavior with ERP
Compulsions may seem logically connected to the OCD triggers, as in the 
case of wanting to wash your hands after touching something you see as 
contaminated, or they may have no clear logical connection to the trigger at 
all — they may simply feel like the right thing to do in order to alleviate your 
discomfort. Thus, after touching a doorknob you may feel compelled to think 
certain “clean thoughts” over and over as a way of neutralizing your obses-
sional fears — that may not be logical, but somehow it makes you feel better.
In either case, compulsions bring a sense of temporary relief and are there-
fore very rewarding. Some people with OCD describe the compulsive act as 
somehow protecting them or their loved ones from danger. Others say that 
performing a compulsion neutralizes the obsession.
Very good reasons exist for preventing your compulsions. They include the 
following:
 
 In the long run, the feelings of relief are short-lived while compulsions 
usually take more and more of your time.
 
 Compulsions prevent you from discovering that obsessions are merely 
obsessive and rarely, if ever, come true.
 
 Compulsions can involve other people and make you feel foolish.
 
 Compulsions ultimately make OCD worse.
 
 Compulsions often hurt your self-esteem. They don’t mean you are 
crazy, but they can sure make you feel that way.
Developing an awareness of the compulsions that your OCD mind urges 
you to do is essential. After making your staircase, list any and all actions 
(whether mental or physical) that you feel compelled to do when encounter-
ing any of those OCD triggers. This is your compulsion list — a list of the 
things you want to work very hard not to do.
In Gil’s case (see the preceding sections), after going over his OCD exposure 
staircase, he realizes that he has a variety of compulsions, including
 
 Counting backwards from 100 to 0 slowly
 
 Disinfecting what he’s touched
 
 Repeating the phrase “I’m clean” seven times
 
 Showering four or five times each day
 
 Washing his hands

166
Par t III: Overcoming OCD 
Your list of compulsions may be quite short, such as only wanting to wash 
your hands, or you may have a lengthy list of compulsions that you turn to. 
Jot down any and all compulsions that you notice yourself tempted to do in 
order to feel better. Keep your list handy — you may find that you discover 
new compulsions popping up. If you do, add them to your list.
 
The “RP” in ERP stands for response prevention. That means not engaging in a 
compulsion.
Preparing to engage in ERP
For many people, starting ERP feels like standing at the end of the highest 
diving board before taking the plunge (of course, if you’re an Olympic diving 
champion, this is not a good metaphor). Nevertheless, we have a couple of 
tips for boosting your courage before you make the dive. You can think of 
these as warm-up exercises. They’re not as intense as the real thing that 
comes next, but they’re a great start.
 
 Take a few deep breaths and delay your compulsive act. Put it off for 
15 minutes, then, later, put it off for 30 minutes. Even later, go for an 
entire hour. Pay attention to how you feel during your delay time.
 
 Do something different — alter your compulsions in some way. If you 
usually have to count to 10 six times, count to 10 five times. Or perform 
your compulsion at top speed one time and at slow speed the next. Clean 
with a different hand if cleaning is your problem. Wash your hands in cold 
water or with just a trickle coming from the faucet. In other words, the 
more you change up your compulsion, the better. Again, pay attention to 
how you feel. These altered compulsions aren’t likely to feel as satisfying 
to you, but they prepare you for living without compulsions altogether.
 
 Remind yourself that you are not your OCD. You will get better. You’ve 
started to reprogram and rewire the OCD part of your brain.
Stepping up through your 
triggers with ERP
Take a look at your OCD staircase as well as your list of usual compulsions. 
Set aside a couple of hours, because ERP takes some time to work. That 
doesn’t mean you’ll hold onto a doorknob for two hours straight. Rather, you 
will touch a doorknob while not using any compulsions. Then you’ll keep 
touching the doorknob frequently, but not constantly.
Realize that ERP is hard work, and that you need to be prepared to feel some dis-
comfort. However, you’re quite likely to find that you can tolerate that discomfort. 

167
 Chapter 10: Tackling OCD Behavior with ERP
Exposure is sort of like jumping into a cool swimming pool on a hot day — it feels 
freezing at first, but you get used to it. Acclimating to exposure takes a lot longer 
than getting used to the temperature of a pool, but you get the point.
 
You’ll find that the discomfort involved with ERP is well worth the effort 
because your symptoms will decrease greatly — and in some cases, a nearly 
complete cure is possible.
Here’s how you proceed with your staircase and list of usual compulsions:
 
1. Pick the lowest stair on your OCD staircase.
 
 Some therapists recommend starting on a stair that has an Ugh Factor 
Rating of at least 50. You can do that, but we like the idea of starting 
slow, especially if you’re doing this on your own.
 
2. Write the label for the stair you’re working on in the “Checking Your 
ERP Progress” form.
 
 Refer to Table 10-1 to see Gil’s progress form for an example. See 
Appendix B for a blank progress form for your use.
 
3. Step on the stair.
 
 In other words, make contact with the OCD trigger. The nature of your 
contact very much depends upon the nature of the specific trigger. 
Thus, if your trigger involves touching doorknobs, you’ll remain in close 
proximity to doorknobs and actually touch them repeatedly and often, 
but not for a single, extended period of time. If your trigger involves 
eating a certain food or shaking someone’s hand, obvious time limits will 
be necessary. Frequent, repeated contact is what usually matters most. 
If you’re uncertain how to proceed, consult a professional.
 
4. Record your Ugh Factor Rating (refer to Table 10-1) when you first 
make contact with your stair. Stay in close contact with the trigger for 
about ten minutes or so.
 
 Refrain from resorting to a compulsion.
 
5. Re-rate your Ugh Factor Rating every ten minutes.
 
 This rating may increase for a while, but stay in contact with your trig-
ger anyway.
 
6. Remain in close contact with your trigger until your Ugh Factor Rating 
decreases.
 
 Ideally, you want it to come down by 50 percent before you move on to 
another step or conclude your ERP session. But don’t be rigid about the 
amount of the drop — any truly significant improvement in your feelings 
can suffice if the ERP has gone on for over an hour.
As you go through the process of ERP, keep the following guidelines in mind:

168
Par t III: Overcoming OCD 
 
 Be on the lookout for subtle compulsions that you find yourself tempted 
to do in order to decrease your distress. You want to avoid coming up 
with a new compulsion, such as wanting to count in your head or 
repeatedly say a poem or prayer.
 
 Don’t try to suppress your obsessions. Go ahead and let yourself worry 
about contamination or whatever. Notice the thoughts, but don’t try 
to suppress them. In fact, it’s a good idea to actively imagine the most 
feared and dire outcomes you can think of actually occurring — such as 
being stricken with a horrible disease and dying a slow, torturous death.
 
 Sometimes you may be able to climb two, three, or more steps in a single 
exposure session. Other times, one step will feel like plenty. You may even 
need to stay with one step for several sessions. Use drops in your Ugh 
Factor Ratings as your guide — slow and steady works just fine.
 
 Conduct at least two or three exposure sessions each week — the more 
the better.
Gil’s OCD exposure staircase began with three stairs that had Ugh Factor Ratings 
of 25, 30, and 30. He recorded each of these triggers in his “Checking Your ERP 
Progress” form. His first exposure session required about 2 hours, but he only 
needed to work on his next stair for about 30 minutes for his Ugh Factor Ratings 
to drop a great deal. His third step took him two separate sessions that each 
lasted close to two hours. You can see Gil’s progress in Table 10-2.

Gil’s “Checking Your ERP Progress” Form

Gil’s “Checking Your ERP Progress” form demonstrates several important 
issues:
 
 Sometimes your initial Ugh rating is inaccurate and you discover that 
your distress is considerably higher (or lower) than you thought it 
would be. That’s no problem. If any step is utterly too intense for you, 
try to come up with another, easier step. If it’s way too easy (such as 
Gil’s stair involving driving by a homeless person), move on to another 
step quickly.

169
 Chapter 10: Tackling OCD Behavior with ERP
 
 Your Ugh Factor Ratings will likely go up and down during your expo-
sure session, though they will generally diminish over time.
 
 Notice that Gil’s third exposure session (involving walking on lawns) did 
not result in a 50 percent reduction in his Ugh Factor Rating. Therefore, 
he repeated the session on another day.
 
 Gil found that tracking his progress in this manner gave him incentive 
for continuing his exposure sessions.
Managing the ERP Process
Successfully carrying out ERP involves paying attention to a variety of important 
issues. It’s easy to find yourself tempted to cheat, so you need to know what’s 
cheating and what’s not. You’ll probably want to enlist support from a helper 
so you need to keep a few things in mind when you do (see Chapter 22 for more 
information about bringing family and friends into the picture). When things 
go wrong, we have some tips for dealing with the problems. And don’t forget 
to pat yourself on the back when you pull all this off — ERP is hard work and 
you deserve some credit.
Did you wash your hands?
How many times did you hear that growing up? 
Parents are always telling their kids to wash 
their hands. If you work around food or in a 
healthcare setting, you’re frequently reminded 
to wash your hands — in such cases, you 
should follow the rules that have been designed 
for those specific settings. Frequent hand-
washing is one of the best ways to prevent get-
ting sick and spreading germs to others. No 
wonder one of the most common compulsions 
of OCD is hand-washing. In ERP, the idea is to 
stop compulsive behavior. However, we don’t 
want people to stop washing entirely. Therefore, 
if you have OCD involving fears of contamina-
tion, you probably need a few rules to know 
when and how washing your hands is okay.
  How to wash your hands: Wash your hands 
with clean water and soap. Rub your hands 
together for about 20 seconds (singing 
“Happy Birthday” to yourself takes about 
that long). If soap is not available, using 
hand sanitizer is okay. Rinse your hands 
well, but briefly. Dry your hands with a 
clean towel.
  When to wash your hands: After using 
the bathroom, before preparing food, after 
changing a diaper, after coughing or sneez-
ing, before and after being around someone 
who shows obvious signs of illness, after 
picking up after or playing with an animal, 
after handling garbage, or after handling 
something that is visually dirty.

170
Par t III: Overcoming OCD 
Knowing what’s cheating and what’s not
Your OCD mind will want to come up with clever ideas for helping you deal 
with the distress that ERP involves. Consuming alcohol, smoking pot, and 
taking other illegal drugs to numb you before engaging in ERP are definitely 
forms of cheating. But you need to be on the lookout for other interesting, 
but misguided, strategies. Ultimately, caving in and using any of these tactics 
will sabotage your efforts at ERP.
Staying above the fray with dissociation
You may attempt to neutralize or diffuse your distress by dissociating, or 
finding ways to remove yourself psychologically from what’s going on. Some 
people try to numb their feelings. Others imagine that they’re removed from 
their bodies and are viewing the ERP process from a distance. Both tech-
niques may make you briefly feel a little better, but they block ERP’s benefits.
Getting propped up with reassurance
You may want to seek reassurance from other people that everything will be 
okay. This strategy seems reasonable and helpful, but it’s actually just like 
the other forms of cheating. Obtaining reassurance makes you feel better, but 
only briefly, and it ruins the effects of ERP. So, if you’re using a friend or helper 
with your ERP (see Chapter 22 for much more information about how helpers 
can do and say the right things), ask them specifically not to reassure you by 
saying things like “It will be alright,” “You’re perfectly safe,” and so on.
Dabbling in distraction
We generally recommend that clients not use distraction to keep themselves 
from engaging in mental compulsions. So you typically want to avoid watch-
ing television, talking on the phone with a friend, or surfing the net during 
exposure tasks. Distraction that almost completely takes you away from feeling 
any discomfort is not a good idea. You don’t learn to break the associations 
between your OCD triggers and the discomfort if you aren’t really “there.”
However, if all else fails, distraction is better than using the compulsion. So 
if you have an uncontrollable mental obsession (such as constant images 
of germs invading your body), studies say that using simple distraction by 
focusing on everyday tasks is better than using your usual mental or behav-
ioral compulsions, such as washing or repeating certain phrases. The key is 
that if you do use distraction, try to maintain at least some attention on the 
exposure task and your feelings of distress.

171
 Chapter 10: Tackling OCD Behavior with ERP
Finding fair relief
So is there anything you can do to reduce your distress during ERP if it feels 
really awful? In a limited way, yes. If you’re already on prescribed medication 
for OCD, keep taking it. Also, you may consider using a brief relaxation strat-
egy, such as the following:
 
1. Inhale slowly and deeply.
 
 Do so by pushing out your abdominal muscles in order to fill the bottom 
part of your lungs first.
 
2. Hold your breath for a few seconds.
 
3. Slowly exhale as you pull your abdominal muscles in.
 
 Exhale to a slow count of eight while making a very slight noise with the 
air in between your lips.
 
4. Repeat up to ten times or so.
This brief breathing/relaxation strategy should be considered a temporary 
stopgap. You can use it for your initial contacts with any given step on your 
OCD staircase. However, you want to stop using the breathing for subsequent 
contact. You should not use this breathing to eliminate your distress, but 
rather to merely help you cope with it for a little while.
 
Brief breathing/relaxation can be an effective strategy for dealing with many 
feelings of stress. Thus, you may want to use it while stuck in traffic and feeling 
frustrated. However, you want to be sure not to allow this strategy to turn into a 
compulsive response associated with your obsessions and/or your OCD triggers.
Troubleshooting ERP
We wish we could tell you that ERP works, that it works every single time, 
and that it works extremely well each time. Ah, but this is the real world, 
isn’t it? It’s true that ERP usually works and, for the most part, improvement 
is quite dramatic when it does. But, just like your car and everything else in 
life, sometimes things misfire. This section is about knowing what to do when 
problems arise in carrying out ERP.
Struggling with getting out of the starting blocks
It’s not uncommon for people with OCD to hear about ERP and respond, 
“Thanks, but no thanks.” That’s because it can sound pretty scary. We would 
say, “Trust us; it’s not that bad and you’ll be able to do it,” but we have a feel-
ing you may not believe us.

172
Par t III: Overcoming OCD 
So instead of just trusting us on this one, we suggest you do something else 
first. If you find yourself unable to get out of the starting blocks with ERP, 
read or reread Chapters 8 and 9 first. These approaches may work for you 
by themselves, or they may simply help you feel more ready to tackle ERP. If 
that doesn’t work, seriously consider medication for your OCD (which is, of 
course, always an option and an especially good one for severe cases).
In addition, if you find ERP particularly scary, see if someone (such as a ther-
apist or good friend assisting you) would be willing to model or demonstrate 
the ERP steps for you before you try them. If they do this, it’s very important 
that you continue the work without their modeling at some point. However, a 
demo or two can provide a boost to get you started. The reason the demon-
strations need to cease at some point is that you could easily start to rely on 
them for excessive reassurance (see the previous section, “Knowing what’s 
cheating and what’s not”).
Finally, work on accepting the idea that nothing — not ERP, medication, or 
anything else — will ever totally remove all uncertainty for you. The OCD 
mind desperately wants to eliminate uncertainty, and ERP looks pretty dubi-
ous and uncertain to many people. Remind yourself often (but not obses-
sively) that one must accept a certain amount of uncertainty.
Constructing huge hierarchies and endless staircases
Many people with OCD construct huge exposure hierarchies with staircases 
that seem to rival the tallest buildings! They want to be certain that they 
don’t miss anything that could be relevant. We’ve seen lists that run many 
pages in length. However, ERP hierarchies work best when the number of 
items runs in the range of about 10 to 20.
So what do you do if your hierarchy has gotten out of hand in length? Try 
condensing your list. Select items that have high priority. You do not need 
to include everything in order to make excellent progress. When people make 
progress on one item, like doorknobs, they usually find that similar things, 
like shaking hands or touching plates, get a little easier too. Finally, make 
sure that the items in your hierarchy all relate to a single OCD theme, such 
as contamination. If another theme appears to be involved, make a separate 
hierarchy for that theme.
Avoiding avoidance
Always be on the lookout for whether you’re engaging in subtle forms of 
avoidance and/or reassurance seeking. Maybe you give your friend or thera-
pist a “certain look” to solicit reassurance that things will be safe and okay. 
Or you may try to avoid ERP by putting it off and procrastinating for reasons 
that may seem good, but are really designed for avoidance.

 Chapter 10: Tackling OCD Behavior with ERP
When progress bogs down
If your progress stalls along the way (or even if your progress is slow from 
the get-go), there are a few things you can do. First, make sure your ERP 
sessions are long enough and frequent enough. Sessions lasting 90 to 120 
minutes usually work pretty well. We’ve found on occasion that prolonging 
the exposure even more can help — anywhere from half a day to several days 
straight in a few cases. With prolonged exposure sessions, you obviously 
won’t remain in constant contact with your triggers, but you will hit many 
triggers repeatedly without engaging in your compulsions.
Another possibility to improve progress is to take a short step backwards. 
In other words, go back to earlier steps and redo them until your Ugh Factor 
Ratings diminish even further. Then proceed ahead once more. If you find 
that one of the steps involves much more distress than you anticipated, you 
can always design a new step to fit in between.
Sometimes progress slows because compulsions crop up despite your best 
efforts to refrain from them. Probably the most difficult compulsions to keep 
from enacting are the mental ones — such as counting inside your head, 
repeating comforting phrases, or mentally trying to either burn or blow up a 
disturbing obsessive image. In this case, your best strategy is to actively refo-
cus on the disturbing obsessive image or thought.
 
Mental compulsions are not the same as obsessions. Obsessions are 
unwanted, feel out of your control, and are highly disturbing. Mental compul-
sions, on the other hand, are the things you do inside your mind to reduce 
your distress and discomfort. The goal is to prevent mental compulsions, 
while remaining in contact with your mental obsessions.
If you get stuck and can’t get going again, that’s the time to get some help. Most 
people with OCD can use help — sometimes from family and friends and quite 
often from professionals. See Chapter 7 for more info on getting help.
Wavering motivation
If you find that your motivation for engaging in ERP wavers, we suggest that 
you jot out a cost/benefit analysis for doing ERP. Make a list of all the advan-
tages and disadvantages of continuing with ERP. Appendix B gives you a 
cost/benefit analysis form that’s designed for dealing with problematic OCD 
beliefs. Your lack of motivation qualifies as a problematic belief. You may 
also want to read or reread Chapter 6 on overcoming obstacles to change.
Coping when bad stuff really happens
People do get robbed; illness happens; houses catch on fire; cars do run over 
people; people die — that’s life, and such events cannot be avoided with or 

174
Par t III: Overcoming OCD 
without OCD. However, if bad luck strikes during your exposure treatment, 
it can set you back. You may conclude that your OCD thinking was right on 
target after all. In such cases, a therapist can help you cope.
Rewarding yourself
Fighting OCD with ERP can be hard work. Appreciate yourself and your 
efforts. When you have completed a particularly hard exposure or success-
fully resisted engaging in a compelling compulsion, do more than give your-
self a pat on the back. Reward yourself with a treat.
Deliberately decide on a reward. Set a goal to complete two (or more) ses-
sions of ERP, and then pay yourself. Think of some activities that are special, 
such as getting a massage, going out to dinner, watching a performance, or 
taking some time to relax — whatever gives you pleasure. Congratulations on 
your hard work — you deserve it!
Limiting ERP
The idea of ERP is to push yourself pretty hard and do some things you find 
quite difficult to do. You’re expected to keep at it until you feel substantial 
improvement in your OCD, and then do a little more. However, we do not 
recommend that you include items on your OCD staircase that most people 
would find extremely difficult or dangerous. For example, we don’t think it’s 
a good idea for you to lick toilet seats or share needles with someone who 
has HIV. If you’re unsure whether a given exposure item is “over the top,” ask 
your therapist or a healthcare provider.

Considering Medications for OCD
In This Chapter
 Figuring out what makes sense for you
 Weighing the pros and cons of taking medication
 Taking a closer look at medications that may help
S
ome people are good candidates for medication and others are not. For 
those who are, certain antidepressant medications have been found to be 
effective in treating OCD. Fortunately, for those who either fail to benefit from 
medication or cannot take it, good alternative treatments are out there (see 
Chapters 8, 9, and 10). In this chapter, we guide you through the information 
you need in order to make an informed decision about taking medication.
Many people are helped by psychotherapies that are useful in the treatment 
of OCD — treatments like exposure and response prevention (ERP), Cognitive 
Therapy, and mindfulness, as well as various combinations of these strate-
gies. Rest assured that the purpose of this chapter is not to pit medication 
against these treatment options. The use of medication doesn’t preclude 
other treatments; on the contrary, many people combine the use of medica-
tion with psychological treatment.
Deciding whether Medication 
Is Right for Your OCD
The decision to take medication for your OCD needs to be a cooperative 
effort between you and your healthcare provider. In order to play an active 
role in the decision-making process, you should be well-informed of the pros 
and cons involved. Your doctor will need access to your health history, and 
will do a complete physical exam to assess your current health status.

176
Par t III: Overcoming OCD 
Getting a thorough check-up
In order to help you determine whether taking medication is right for you, a 
thorough physical exam is in order. Your primary healthcare provider should 
coordinate a comprehensive evaluation of your current health and health 
history. Appropriate laboratory and diagnostic tests should be conducted 
to rule out physical causes of or contributors to your OCD symptoms. Your 
primary care doctor can also be someone to turn to for advice and recom-
mendations for specialists in treating OCD.
 
Some primary care providers do not feel comfortable prescribing medications 
for OCD because they have limited experience in dealing with the problem. 
Be sure to ask your primary care provider whether a referral to a psychiatrist 
who specializes in OCD would be a good idea.
Coming clean with your doctor about 
your health and medications
Medications that affect your mind and your mood are powerful agents. If you 
and your healthcare provider decide to use them as a tool to help alleviate 
symptoms of OCD, you must work in close collaboration. If you are honest 
and open, you can expect your doctor to be respectful and nonjudgmental.
Before you begin taking any new medication, talk with your doctor about the 
following:
 
 Inform your doctor of any other health problems you have, including 
allergies, a history of heart problems, head injuries, seizures, problems 
with blood pressure, diabetes, glaucoma, or substance addiction.
 
 Be open about other problems you may be having such as insomnia, 
poor appetite, or fatigue. Be sure to let your provider know if you have 
ever been diagnosed with a mood disorder.
 
 Discuss concerns you have about taking medication.
 
 Provide a list of all other medications, either prescribed or over-the-
counter, that you take. Include any herbs or supplements you are taking 
in this list.
 
 Tell your doctor if you are pregnant, considering getting pregnant, or 
breastfeeding.
 
 Be honest about habits such as drinking, smoking, or using other drugs.

177
 Chapter 11: Considering Medications for OCD
If you decide to give medication a try, keep the following tips in mind:
 
 Take your medication as prescribed. If you decide to discontinue your 
medication, talk to your healthcare provider before you actually stop 
taking it. You may experience significant side effects from abrupt discon-
tinuation.
 
 Discuss any side effects you may be feeling. Let your doctor know if you 
are feeling more depressed, suicidal, agitated, or uneasy, or if you’re 
experiencing any sexual side effects.
 
 Be patient. Positive treatment effects may not be noticeable for a while — 
up to twelve weeks in some cases. Furthermore, your dosage may need to 
be adjusted, or you may need to try different medications before you find 
what works best for you.
Looking at reasons for 
medicating your OCD
Most experts in OCD agree that psychological treatment is the preferred 
choice for most cases of OCD, especially for OCD in children. However, in 
some cases, psychological treatment may not have the desired effect, or it 
may not be enough in and of itself. Medication may be a good choice when
 
 Your OCD is severe. If your symptoms are ruining your life and you cannot 
work, function at home, or be independent, medication may decrease your 
symptoms enough so that you can start psychological treatment. You’re 
still likely to benefit from ERP treatment (see Chapter 10).
 
 Your OCD is combined with depression. Most people with OCD have 
at least some symptoms of depression, and about 2/3 of sufferers have 
had a major depressive disorder at some point in their lives. Depression 
alone can be treated by psychological treatment and/or medication. 
However, when you add OCD to the mix, both forms of treatment may 
prove to be necessary.
 
 Your OCD is accompanied by suicidal thoughts. If you feel hopeless 
and have thoughts of suicide, you must get help immediately. If you’re 
unable to reach a mental-health professional, go to the emergency room 
of a hospital or call 911. Don’t wait. Help is available.
 
 You have bipolar disorder. Most people with bipolar disorder need 
medication management. Your best bet is to consult with a psychiatrist 
who has expertise in both OCD and bipolar disorder.

178
Par t III: Overcoming OCD 
 
 You see or hear things that others do not see or hear. These symptoms 
are quite serious and almost certainly require medication. You will likely 
need a psychiatrist to evaluate your condition and prescribe treatment.
 
 Your thinking is very confused. If you can’t seem to concentrate or 
think rationally, medication may be appropriate. We still recommend a 
mental-health therapist to support you with psychotherapy.
 
 You refuse to try ERP. A significant number of people with OCD can’t 
stand the thought of ERP. For those people, medication may help take the 
edge off so that later they can try exposure. Or, in a few cases, they may 
discover that medication works so well that they feel little need for ERP.
 
 You’ve tried therapy and it hasn’t worked. Some people don’t benefit 
from the various OCD-specific psychotherapies (see Chapters 6, 8, 9, 
and 10). Medication can sometimes decrease symptoms sufficiently so 
that therapy can work.
 
 You can’t find a therapist nearby or one that you can afford. 
Unfortunately, some areas do not have sufficient numbers of trained 
therapists who can do ERP or cognitive therapy. Some insurance plans 
do not pay for mental-health services.
 
 If money is a factor in your treatment, you may be able to find a univer-
sity, community mental-health clinic, or a few private practitioners who 
provide services on a sliding fee scale — you just have to ask.
 
 You can’t find the time in your schedule for psychotherapy. We hope 
this isn’t the case. But we realize that some people don’t have the 
time. Frankly, if you can’t find a couple of hours a week for therapy, 
that may be part of the problem. Stress can certainly make OCD worse. 
Furthermore, OCD steals considerable amounts of time from your day. 
Think of how much more time you will have without obsessions and 
compulsions. That said, medication, if it works, takes less time.
The story of Max illustrates a positive use of medication. Max’s thinking was 
too confused for him to benefit from psychological treatment. For Max, taking 
medication was necessary to get him on the path to recovery.
Max believes that food purchased at restaurants and grocery stores is 
contaminated by fecal matter in the groundwater. Max used to think 
shopping at an organic grocery store was safe, until a couple of years 
ago, when he read about organic spinach being contaminated by fecal 
matter. Max’s OCD has caused him to lose his job and his friends, and to 
isolate himself from his family.
One day, his brother shows up at his apartment and is appalled to see 
Max, emaciated, with several pots of boiling water on his stove. Max has 
restricted his food intake to boiled potatoes and boiled ground beef. He 
boils each for 45 minutes. Max seems to be out of touch with reality, so 
his brother takes him to the emergency room.

179
 Chapter 11: Considering Medications for OCD
There, Max is given a prescription for an antidepressant and an appoint-
ment with a psychiatrist. Family members make sure that he keeps his 
appointments. After two months, Max no longer believes that the food 
supply is contaminated. However, he still has many OCD symptoms. The 
psychiatrist keeps him on the medication and refers him to a psychologist 
for ERP.
Understanding the side effects 
and risks of medications
If popping a pill once or twice a day can help rid you of OCD, why not? There 
are downsides to taking medications, which can vary from person to person. 
Here are some issues for you to ponder before starting medication:
 
 Side effects: Antidepressants can have very distressing side effects. Dry 
mouth, weight gain, constipation, tremors, diarrhea, insomnia, nausea, 
headaches, and dizziness are all commonly reported. For most people, 
these effects decrease over time. And your doctor can sometimes rec-
ommend other medications to decrease your discomfort. Unfortunately, 
the side effects cause many people to stop taking medication before it 
has a chance to work.
 
 Sexual problems: This one can be pretty bothersome. Some people report 
loss of sex drive and others have trouble achieving an orgasm. These symp-
toms usually go away or can be treated with other medications.
 
 Discontinuation Syndrome: People on antidepressants sometimes 
have a difficult time stopping their medication. Some report feeling out 
of sorts or anxious; others feel like they have the flu. These symptoms 
can usually be avoided by slowly tapering the dosage of the medication 
under the guidance of your healthcare provider.
 
 Pregnancy and breastfeeding: No long-term, well-controlled studies 
have been done on the effects of many medications during pregnancy or 
breastfeeding. We urge caution. Psychotherapeutic alternatives should 
be considered first.
 
 Concern about relapse: When medications work for treating OCD, they 
generally work very well, though rarely do they accomplish a complete 
remission of OCD symptoms. And if a person decides to stop medica-
tion, the symptoms usually return. Psychological treatments, on the 
other hand, provide greater protection against relapse.
 
 Suicide risk: The FDA warns that there may be a slight increase in the 
risk of suicidal thoughts in children, adolescents, and young adults who 
start antidepressant medication. Because of this risk, people who start 

180
Par t III: Overcoming OCD 
on antidepressant medication should be seen regularly and encouraged 
to call their healthcare provider if they experience any of the following:
 
• Thoughts about dying
 
• Thoughts about suicide
 
• Worsening depression
 
• Agitation
 
• Irritability
 
• Aggression
 
• Unusual behaviors
 
• Inability to sleep
Looking at Your OCD Medication Options
Medications that are used to treat OCD are all antidepressants that increase 
the availability of serotonin and, sometimes, other chemical messengers, or 
neurotransmitters, in the brain. Serotonin supports communication between 
neurons in the brain. It affects your mood, your level of anxiety, your percep-
tion of pain, your memory, and your ability to control impulses. See Chapter 
4 for more information about the brain’s role in OCD.
Yikes I feel a yawn coming on
Decreased libido and inability to have an 
orgasm are quite common side effects of many 
medications for OCD. However, extremely rare, 
unexpected, spontaneous orgasms have also 
been linked to certain antidepressant medica-
tions. Some researchers suspect that many of 
these cases aren’t being reported to the pre-
scribing doctor. No kidding.
Case studies reported in the Canadian Journal 
of Psychiatry and the Journal of Biological 
Psychiatry have documented these unusual 
side effects. One woman reported a three-hour 
orgasm while shopping! Wow. She found the 
experience pleasurable, but a tad socially awk-
ward. Incredibly, there have been numerous 
reports of yawning spells with simultaneous 
orgasm while taking antidepressants. Yawning 
can occur at any time and the orgasm appears 
to be uncontrollable. This can be particularly 
uncomfortable for men when accompanied by 
ejaculation. On the other hand, obviously this 
reaction can also be quite pleasant. So, if you 
are being treated with antidepressants, and 
you want to feel good, try watching reruns of 
Green Acres. Yawn.

181
 Chapter 11: Considering Medications for OCD
People with OCD usually require higher doses of these drugs than the amounts 
typically prescribed for treating depression. Prescriptions are often started 
at a low dose and gradually increased. Furthermore, medications for OCD fre-
quently require six to twelve weeks to significantly improve OCD symptoms, 
whereas these same medications sometimes work a little faster when used for 
depression.
Generally, medication treatment continues for about a year — after which a 
gradual discontinuance is sometimes attempted. However, many people find 
that they need to go back on medication, frequently for a lifetime, for suc-
cessful OCD treatment. The odds of long-term success with medication with-
drawal are improved greatly if ERP has been provided at some point.
Seeking serotonin with SSRIs
The first choice of medication for most people with OCD is one of the selec-
tive serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). SSRIs appear to work by increas-
ing the level of serotonin that’s available to the nerve cells. Exactly how that 
increased availability impacts OCD specifically is an unresolved issue.
These drugs have been extensively studied and found to be effective in 
decreasing symptoms of OCD. Currently the SSRIs that have been found 
to be effective for OCD and officially sanctioned by the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) include:
 
 Luvox (Fluvoxamine): This antidepressant was the first SSRI to receive 
FDA approval for the treatment of OCD. Luvox is somewhat sedating. 
Therefore, it often provides immediate relief from the anxiety part of 
OCD. However, you may have more gastrointestinal side effects.
 
 Paxil (Paroxetine): This medication works for anxiety and depression. 
It tends to be sedating and is associated with weight gain. Some find dis-
continuing this medication very uncomfortable.
 
 Prozac (Fluoxetine): This antidepressant boosts energy for many 
people. When beginning treatment, you may experience an increase in 
anxiety and have difficulty sleeping. Withdrawal symptoms tend to be 
milder with Prozac than for the other SSRIs.
 
 Zoloft (Sertraline): Like Prozac, this antidepressant is associated with 
increased energy. It is often considered the best choice for people with 
heart disease.

182
Par t III: Overcoming OCD 
Other antidepressant medications that affect not only serotonin but also a few 
other brain neurotransmitters (see Chapter 4 for more information about neu-
rotransmitters) appear to work for OCD as well. However, they haven’t received 
as much study as the ones listed above. A few of these options include:
 
 Celexa (Citalopram): This SSRI medication may have fewer negative 
interactions with other medications.
 
 Lexapro (Escitalopram): Similar to Celexa, this SSRI may work faster 
than some of the others.
 
 Effexor (Venlafaxine): Effexor boosts both serotonin and norepineph-
rine. It sometimes appears to work for OCD when other SSRIs don’t. This 
drug can boost energy. Effexor sometimes increases blood pressure. It is 
not suggested for those with heart problems.
Trying tricyclics
An older antidepressant, Anafranil (Clomipramine), was the first antidepres-
sant medication found to be effective for OCD. Clomipramine is still used, 
especially when other SSRIs have not worked. The primary reason that 
Clomipramine is sometimes avoided is that an overdose can be fatal. It is 
at least as effective as the SSRIs, but it has more unpleasant side effects. 
Clomimpramine also carries some risk of inducing seizures, increased heart 
rate, and problems with withdrawal.
Clomimpramine belongs to the class of antidepressants known as tricyclics. 
Tricyclic refers to the chemical structure of the drugs in this class rather 
than the effects they have on neurotransmitters, as is the case with SSRIs. 
Clomimpramine appears to affect various neurotransmitters, including sero-
tonin and norepinephrine.
 
Other than Clomimpramine, tricyclic antidepressants (such as Imipramine or 
Amitriptyline) do not appear to be helpful in the treatment of OCD, nor does 
the class of antidepressants known as MAO inhibitors.
Adding other medications
Prescribing medicine is part science and part art. At this point, the under-
standing of exactly how antidepressants work and which one is best for a 
particular person is pretty primitive. Patients frequently have to try multiple 
antidepressant medications in order to find the one that works for them. For 
unknown reasons, one SSRI may do nothing for a particular individual, yet 
another one will prove to be quite helpful.

183
 Chapter 11: Considering Medications for OCD
Sometimes, other medications are added to the first to augment the effects of 
the first medication. Furthermore, many people with OCD have other prob-
lems such as depression, attention problems, or another anxiety disorder 
(see Chapter 3). In those cases, other drugs may be used to treat the co-
occurring disorder. Be willing to work with your doctor in order to find the 
best regimen for you. Some of those drugs include:
 
 Buspar (buspirone): This medication helps reduce anxiety symptoms. It 
does not cause dependence or problems with withdrawal. It is considered 
relatively safe and does not cause severe sedation. However, effects may 
not be noticeable until you’ve taken the drug for a week or more.
 
 Clonazepan (Klonopin): Like Buspar, this drug decreases anxiety. The 
effects can be felt immediately, but unlike Buspar, this medication can 
cause dependence.
 
 Lithium carbonate (Eskalith): Lithium and other mood stabilizers (Depakote, 
Tegretol, Neurontin, Topamax, Lamictal) are used when OCD occurs 
with bipolar disorder. They are also used to enhance the effectiveness 
of antidepressant medications.
Biological Alternatives to Medication
A few people with OCD are not able to ben-
efit from standard treatments. These people 
are severely impaired and not able to function 
because of their disorder. In these cases, there 
have been multiple trials of antidepressant 
medications, as well as other types of medica-
tions. For some of these people, ERP as well as 
cognitive techniques have been tried without 
success. This type of OCD is called treatment 
refractory, meaning it is resistant to ordinary 
means of treatment.
When all else fails, brain surgery is a contro-
versial option. These surgeries are very rare 
and involve destroying a small amount of the 
brain. This destruction interrupts the circuit of 
the brain that has been implicated in ODC (see 
Chapter 4). For obvious reasons, there are no 
“controlled” studies where people with OCD 
are randomly assigned to brain surgery or other 
treatment. Therefore, the success of these sur-
geries is based on case reports. Unfortunately, 
over half of those treated with brain surgery 
continue to have OCD.
A less extreme option, but still a last resort, is 
deep brain stimulation. A few case reports have 
found this technique to reduce OCD symptoms. 
These results are promising and this technique 
does not require destruction of brain tissue. As 
knowledge of the brain increases, treatments 
that are less invasive and more specifics will 
likely be discovered.

184
Par t III: Overcoming OCD 
 
 Other medications: There are numerous other drugs that your doctor 
may try to help reduce your symptoms. Stimulant medications can be 
used to improve attention. However, stimulants can increase anxiety, 
which many of those with OCD already have in abundance. Atypical 
antipsychotics are sometimes given when there is severe depression or 
disordered thinking.
 
Many of the drugs listed above have not been studied specifically for use with 
people suffering from OCD. However, specialists have used different combina-
tions successfully to treat their patients with OCD and other disorders.

R
elapse is part of the treatment process. Most OCD sufferers experience 
a recurrence of OCD symptoms at some point during or after their 
treatment. But take heart: Relapses are normal, and with patience and persis-
tence, you can continue on your road to recovery.
By the conclusion of treatment, many people have successfully reduced their 
OCD symptoms by 50 to 75 percent. Occasionally, people succeed in com-
pletely eliminating their symptoms. Even moderate reductions in symptoms 
usually result in more time for pleasurable pursuits, enhanced relationships, 
and a substantially higher overall quality of life. These benefits are obtain-
able for most folks with OCD — even for many whose symptoms are severe.
Regardless of where you are in treatment, the information in this chapter can 
be useful. Maybe you want to know about relapse risks before you even begin 
treatment for your OCD. Or maybe you know someone who is recovering 
from the disorder. After all, forewarned is forearmed!
In this chapter, we give you the straight dope on relapse and OCD, like 
which treatments have a higher rate of relapse, what to do if relapse comes 
knocking at your door, and how you can reduce the risk of relapse.

186
Par t III: Overcoming OCD 
Knowing the Risks of Relapse
Relapse occurs with varying frequency after successful treatment of most 
emotional disorders, and OCD is no exception. Relapse from OCD treatment 
can be very high, but the risk greatly depends on the type of treatment you 
receive as well as how you handle your relapse. The sections that follow give 
you an idea of what you may encounter as far as OCD relapse challenges.
Medication relapse rates
As discussed in Chapter 11, various medications have a good track record 
for demonstrating the ability to greatly reduce OCD symptoms. But for a host 
of reasons, many people with OCD choose to discontinue their medications. 
Sometimes they want to become pregnant and worry about possible effects 
on the developing fetus. Other times, they experience distressing side effects, 
such as weight gain, dizziness, nausea, loss of sexual desire and/or inabil-
ity to experience orgasms. And for some, discontinuing medication simply 
reflects a personal philosophical preference.
 
If you have experienced success with medications and decide to discontinue 
them, you should do so only under a doctor’s supervision. That’s because 
abruptly stopping certain medications can cause discontinuation syndromes 
that involve various distressing physiological reactions, depending on the 
type of medication involved and the individual person.
Be prepared to experience an increase in your OCD symptoms — especially 
if medications were the only thing you used to treat your OCD. Relapse rates 
following medication discontinuation are disturbingly high — estimates vary 
widely, but can run from 75 to 90 percent or so if you had no other type of 
treatment for your OCD.
If you choose to go off your medication, you can reduce the risk of relapse by 
heeding the following advice:
 
 Continue medication for at least a year or two before considering dis-
continuance. Taper off your medication slowly and under your doctor’s 
supervision. If symptoms return, consider going back on medication, 
perhaps even for a lifetime.
 
 Seriously consider exposure and response prevention (ERP) therapy, 
either while you’re on medication or when you start to taper off of it. 
Studies suggest that if you combine medication with ERP, your risk of 
relapse plummets.

187
 Chapter 12: Responding to and Recovering from Relapse
ERP relapse rates
We have some pretty good news about ERP and the risk of relapse. If you 
successfully treat your OCD with ERP therapy, your odds of relapse are fairly 
low. A number of large studies have shown that if you respond well to ERP, 
you have a very good chance (perhaps as much as 70 to 80 percent) of main-
taining your gains after treatment is completed — possibly for several years. 
Your improvement may even last much longer — we simply don’t have a lot 
of studies that have followed participants for more than a few years.
If you took medication in combination with ERP, no problem. Most studies 
suggest that medication does not increase your risk of relapse following suc-
cessful combined treatment. However, adding medication to ERP doesn’t 
substantially improve the relapse rates once medication is discontinued. It’s 
possible that your odds of maintaining gains may improve somewhat if you 
remain on medication for a lifetime.
CBT and mindfulness relapse rates
Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and mindfulness techniques (see 
Chapters 8 and 9) are two approaches that have similar strategies and goals. 
Unfortunately, the data on relapse risk with these approaches is rather thin — 
we need more studies before we can make definitive statements about the 
relapse risks associated with these two forms of OCD treatment. Given that 
early studies have shown that CBT and mindfulness appear to work pretty 
well for OCD, at least in the short term, we suspect future research is likely to 
show that they help reduce relapse risks as well.
This is particularly true if the track records of these treatments’ success in 
treating depression are any indication. When used to treat depression, CBT 
has been shown to substantially reduce the risk of relapse as compared to 
medication. Similar evidence suggests that mindfulness may also reduce the 
risk of depression relapse.
Responding Well to Relapse
Only a few people who are treated for OCD are truly, 100 percent cured. Just 
because relapse happens doesn’t mean your treatment is not successful. 
The vast majority of people continue to have some mild symptoms that are 
occasionally irritating or annoying. Others have a few lapses here and there, 
especially when under stress. Another group of people (we don’t have the 

188
Par t III: Overcoming OCD 
long-term studies to say exactly how many) suffer a full-blown return of their 
OCD. (See the later section, “Knowing the difference between a lapse and a 
relapse,” for a more detailed explanation.) So what should you do if your OCD 
symptoms return? Here are three approaches for dealing with relapse:
 
 Do what worked for you before. If you used ERP, do that again. You 
can try ERP on your own or go back to a therapist. Treatment is usually 
more efficient the second time around because you already know what 
to expect. If you took antidepressant medication, try going back on it.
 
 Try something new. If you go back and find that what worked before 
is no longer effective, other treatment alternatives are available. From 
what we know, ERP is probably the best bet for long-term manage-
ment of OCD. So, certainly, if you were only taking medication and you 
experience a relapse, we strongly suggest trying ERP (see Chapter 10). 
If you’ve previously done ERP, consider reviewing Chapters 8 and 9 for 
additional ideas. If you’ve tried ERP and/or CBT but not medication, by 
all means, review Chapter 11 for medication options.
 
 Accept a little OCD in your life. Is OCD always bad? Not necessarily. 
Millions of talented people — artists, writers, scientists, and other good 
people all over the world — have OCD. (Oh, and did we mention book edi-
tors?) A little OCD can encourage creativity, hard work, and carefulness.
OCD can be an enemy of well-being. But a little OCD once in a while can be 
okay. The more you can embrace OCD as a friend, maybe as a pesky friend, 
but nevertheless a friend — the less OCD will overtake you.
Strategies for Reducing Relapse
The best defense against relapse is getting the right treatment (or combina-
tion of treatments) for your OCD to begin with. Although medication alone 
works well (see Chapter 11), you can reduce your relapse risk substantially 
by either remaining on your medication for a very long time (perhaps for life) 
or by combining medication with ERP. Also, combining ERP with CBT and/or 
mindfulness can help.
Nevertheless, relapse happens no matter what the problem is or what ther-
apy is being used. In the following sections, we discuss steps you can take, or 
at least be aware of, to help you guard against OCD relapse.

 Chapter 12: Responding to and Recovering from Relapse
Knowing the difference between 
a lapse and a relapse
Chapter 8 tells you that the way you interpret events makes a huge difference 
in the way you end up feeling. That principle holds for an occasional return 
of obsessions and compulsions. A lapse can be defined as a mild slip involv-
ing a mild increase in symptoms. By contrast, a relapse is considered to be a 
major regression toward pre-treatment functioning. We give you examples of 
each of these in the following sections.
Looking at a lapse
A lapse is usually mild and transient. In the following example, Jeremy gets 
treatment for his OCD and then experiences an occasional obsession, which 
indicates a lapse.
Jeremy suffers from OCD that centers on the theme of contamination. He 
avoids public restrooms and restaurants. He is first referred for help when 
his primary care provider notices that his hands are raw and bleeding. 
Jeremy confesses that he often spends an hour in his shower and washes 
his hands hundreds of times during the day.
After 12 sessions of ERP, Jeremy’s symptoms are under control. Jeremy 
continues to have moments when obsessive thoughts return. He reminds 
himself that the obsessions are normal and to be expected. He purposely 
waits until the thoughts pass and does not engage in compulsive wash-
ing. Most days Jeremy feels that he is leaving OCD behind him.
Jeremy had been told by his therapist that thoughts that seem like obses-
sions occur in everyone from time to time (see Chapter 2 for information 
about how people without OCD frequently have thoughts that look much like 
obsessions — but they just don’t take them all that seriously). And Jeremy 
had been informed that such thoughts would no doubt pop back into his 
mind from time to time. Armed with that information, Jeremy understands 
that his obsessions are normal, expected, and something that he can handle. 
He knows if they happen to worsen, he now has skills and tools for dealing 
with them. Such brief visits from his old obsessional thoughts are merely 
mild, temporary lapses — not a full-blown return of his OCD.
Revealing a relapse
A relapse can begin with a lapse and then spiral downward from there, 
resulting in a full-blown return of obsessions and compulsions.
In the following example, Todd initially makes a good decision to seek help 
for his compulsive hand-washing. However, when he encounters a normal 
uncomfortable situation — the flu — his obsessions return.

190
Par t III: Overcoming OCD 
Todd has OCD focused on contamination concerns. He is a compulsive 
washer and avoids public places as much as he can. His washing takes 
up hours of his day. Todd talks about this with his primary care doctor, 
who tells Todd about different kinds of treatment. Todd and his doctor 
choose to try an antidepressant to see whether that will help. Todd’s 
doctor reminds him that the medication can take a while to have an 
effect. Todd is relieved to know that he may get better. After about eight 
weeks, his symptoms seem to lessen. He doesn’t always think about con-
tamination, and his compulsions to wash have lessened.
An early flu season hits, and Todd comes down with the flu. He finds him-
self obsessing about what may have made him sick. The more he thinks 
about it, the more he begins to avoid public places and engage in compul-
sive washing. Todd calls his doctor to complain that the medication is no 
longer working. The doctor encourages Todd to stay on the medication 
and consider seeing a psychotherapist for ERP therapy. Todd throws 
the pills away and hangs up the phone. Within a few weeks, Todd is back 
where he started with OCD controlling his life.
Todd’s story illustrates how a lapse can turn into a relapse. The lapse began 
when Todd started to obsess a little about how he got the flu. The relapse 
came when he became discouraged and threw away his pills — resulting in 
a return of his symptoms with a vengeance. Todd would probably have ben-
efited from psychological treatment in the form of CBT, mindfulness, or ERP 
in order to help him understand and deal with his setback.
 
An OCD lapse need not turn into a full-blown relapse. It all depends on what 
you do with it.
Prolonging treatment
Realtors have a saying that success all comes down to three words — loca-
tion, location, location. When it comes to OCD treatment, we like to say suc-
cess boils down to persistence, persistence, persistence — no matter where 
you are in your treatment process. As we explain in the section “Medication 
relapse rates,” if you choose medication to treat your OCD, you should be 
willing to continue taking it for at least a year or two, and perhaps a lifetime.
If you treat your OCD with ERP, CBT, mindfulness, and/or medication, with 
luck and considerable effort you will see a great deal of improvement within 
a few months. Many people see significant, sustained improvement within 
four or five months. On the other hand, sometimes severe cases and/or OCD 
that’s combined with other problems can require prolonged treatment. Some 
people benefit from working on their problem over several years. In almost 
all of those cases, we suggest multi-pronged treatments involving most of the 
strategies we discuss in this book.

191
 Chapter 12: Responding to and Recovering from Relapse
Phasing out your sessions gradually
The relationship between you and a therapist is unique. Therapy is a time 
when you can be open about your weaknesses, fears, and secrets. Within this 
relationship there is trust, confidentiality, and safety. You have the undivided 
attention of someone who wants to help. That can feel pretty good.
However, usually a point is reached when therapy can and should be termi-
nated. Most of the time, this happens when the client and therapist agree 
that the goals of treatment have been met. Nevertheless, when you realize 
that progress has been made, you may worry that you won’t be able to main-
tain it on your own. When that time is approaching, the following suggestions 
can ease the process.
 
 Taper off the frequency of your sessions slowly. When you’re close to 
reaching your goals, try seeing your therapist every other week and then 
monthly.
 
 Have your therapist help you develop a relapse plan. How will you 
handle upsetting times or increased symptoms?
 
 Be sure to talk about how you can be your own therapist. You can 
engage in ERP on your own. You can also return to using other CBT 
strategies, such as Cognitive Therapy and mindfulness described in 
Chapters 8 and 9.
 
 See whether your therapist can offer you limited contact. We some-
times set up occasional e-mail contact or a brief follow-up phone call. 
These can cut off trouble before it gets out of hand.
 
You should also know that you usually can return to therapy for a tune-up. 
The nice thing about a brief return to your previous therapist is that you don’t 
have to start from square one.
Staging a fire drill
If you work in a school or hospital, you probably run through fire drills from 
time to time. That way, if a real fire ever breaks out, everyone knows what to 
do. We recommend you do the same for your OCD.
Fire drills for OCD start with making a list of high-risk situations — anything 
that may trigger a return visit from your OCD obsessions and compulsions. 
Depending upon the focus or theme of your OCD concerns, the following may 
trigger your OCD:
 
 A burglary occurs in your neighborhood, causing obsessions about 
checking your locks.

192
Par t III: Overcoming OCD 
 
 A fire breaks out somewhere and triggers obsessions about your home’s 
fire-safe worthiness.
 
 You have a thought about harming someone and fear you may act on it.
 
 You run over an unexpected bump in the road that you didn’t see and 
fear that you may have run someone over.
 
 You shake hands with someone you later learn has cancer, and fear 
you may have caught it (even though cancer isn’t transmitted this way, 
those with OCD sometimes have this fear).
 
 You step in a pile of dog poop and worry about becoming contaminated.
As you can see, we could list dozens, hundreds, maybe thousands of such 
items. Gosh, that would make filling up the rest of the pages of this book 
really easy. Hmm, we’re guessing our editors wouldn’t particularly like that 
idea though.
The point of making such a list is to be prepared. Expect to encounter such 
situations. When you expect the inevitable, you won’t be shocked or sur-
prised when it happens, and you can have a plan ready. Perhaps you’ll want 
to try some mindfulness or a brief regimen of ERP (see Chapters 9 and 10).
Finally, it’s not a bad idea to read about all the various types of OCD themes 
discussed in Chapters 13 through 19. You’re not very likely to develop a new 
type of OCD, but it can happen. If it does, you’ll already have some ideas 
about how to handle it.
Remaining vigilant
Very few people will eliminate their OCD virtually 100 percent and not expe-
rience an occasional setback. You can nip these setbacks in the bud if you 
catch them early. Therefore, we suggest that following successful treatment, 
you actually create a log and track your obsessions and compulsions. You 
don’t have to keep this log all the time — start by tracking once a month for a 
few days at a time.
If your symptoms remain low, that’s great. You may then reduce your moni-
toring to a day or two every few months. If your obsessions and compulsions 
even start to creep up, take them seriously. Check out the earlier section 
“Responding Well to Relapse” for ideas.

193
 Chapter 12: Responding to and Recovering from Relapse
Zeroing in on especially 
problematic beliefs
We have found that two specific beliefs frequently seem to creep into the 
mind following successful OCD treatment, and these beliefs can pave the way 
for relapse. We discuss both of these beliefs so you can be on the lookout for 
them. (See Chapter 8 for more info on beliefs that provide fuel for OCD.)
Feeling as if something is true when you know it isn’t
After your symptoms have been substantially reduced, you very well may 
find yourself thinking things like:
 
 “I don’t believe that using a public telephone is a threat to my health, 
but it still feels like it could be.”
 
 “I understand that walking into an Alzheimer’s ward isn’t going to make 
me demented, but it feels like it might.”
 
 “Well, sure I now know that I can’t really get toxic contaminants into my 
body by touching drywall, but I feel like I can.”
 
Obsessions and compulsions love to try sneaking in the back door. And it’s 
easy to have thoughts like, “Big deal, so what if I cave into a few of my obses-
sions?” On the one hand, it isn’t a huge problem if you slip a little. On the 
other hand, if you start having strong feelings that run counter to what your 
observant, rational mind tells you (see Chapter 9), this contradiction can 
serve as an important warning sign that your OCD mind is attempting a come-
back. We recommend you conduct a cost/benefit analysis of buying into the 
OCD part of your mind rather than the observant, rational mind. See Chapter 9 
for information about how to conduct such an analysis.
 
You may also find it useful to ask yourself whether these feelings are based 
on clear evidence that most people would agree is valid. Generally speaking, 
such evidence should be based on things that you can clearly see, touch, hear, 
smell, or taste.
Feeling as if you must avoid all negative feelings
Please realize that negative feelings absolutely cannot be avoided in life. If 
you try to avoid all such feelings, relapse may be waiting around the next 
corner, ready to pounce. We find that physical training provides an excellent 
analogy for helping you think about this issue.

194
Par t III: Overcoming OCD 
Most people, including us, find that intense physical exercise causes a few 
discomforts — shortness of breath for a while, soreness, stiffness, sweating, 
and so on. However, the more you exercise, the more you feel the benefits — 
including less negative feelings. These benefits include:
 
 Enhanced sense of well-being
 
 Increased endurance
 
 Increased flexibility
 
 Increased mobility
 
 Increased strength
 
 Reduced pain
Tolerating the discomfort associated with obsessions works exactly the same 
way. In the short run, you feel distress, anxiety, and frustration. Sometimes 
those feelings can be quite intense. But the more you resist caving into the 
discomfort with your usual compulsions, the more your tolerance increases 
and the less discomfort you feel.
Recognizing events that trigger relapse
There are no guarantees in life. Roadblocks, setbacks, detours, and crashes 
inevitably occur. When these events happen, OCD symptoms may return. 
Increased stress decreases your ability to stay mentally healthy. Watch out 
for times of high stress that could trigger relapse, such as:
 
 Getting sick or injured
 
 Losing a friend
 
 Losing a job or failing to get an expected promotion
 
 Sleeping poorly
 
 Suffering a loss
 
 Watching the stock market tank and your 401K evaporate
 
 Working too hard
What some people don’t realize is that even positive life events and changes 
can also trigger relapse. Whenever the status quo changes — even for the 
better — don’t be shocked if some of your symptoms return. Most people 

195
 Chapter 12: Responding to and Recovering from Relapse
with OCD struggle with the unpredictability and uncertainty that come with 
almost any type of change. The following events can trigger stress, and 
therefore, OCD:
 
 Getting married
 
 Graduating
 
 Having a baby
 
 Getting a new job
 
 Retiring
If a major life transition occurs shortly before a return of your OCD symp-
toms, you may find that it’s very important to deal with the implications of 
that event prior to working on your OCD again.
 
Just because a negative or positive event occurs doesn’t mean you are 
compelled to respond compulsively.

themes and concerns. The chapters in this part

Training (HRT) for some of the cousins of OCD.

W
orry wears you out. People with the doubting and checking type 
of OCD feel uneasy and worried much of the time. Many of their 
concerns have a remote chance of happening, but a few are extremely 
bizarre and unrealistic. More than a few people focus on worries about 
illness and disease. Normal body fluctuations, such as muscle soreness 
after exercise, turn into an esoteric, degenerative neurological disease 
in their minds. For some people, these fears and behaviors occur hundreds 
of times each day.
Doubting comes in the form of an obsession: an unwanted image, urge, or 
thought. The doubt is intense, realistic, and vivid. These obsessions center 
on things such as damage being done to your house or harming someone, 
all through some imagined negligence on your part.
Checking is the compulsive part. There is a compelling need to see whether 
the lights are on, the door is open, or someone got hurt. See Chapter 2 
for more information about the differences between obsessions and 
compulsions.
In this chapter, we provide more detail about the doubting and checking 
types of OCD. We give you specific strategies for dealing with doubt and 
resisting checking.

200
Part IV: Targeting Specific Symptoms of OCD 
Defining Categories of Doubting
Doubt means uncertainty. Doubt leads to questions, hesitation, and, in the 
case of OCD, checking. Doubt is associated with many of the other types of 
OCD, but in the doubting and checking type, doubt towers over reason and 
logic. The individual, specific doubts of Doubting and Checking OCD vary 
endlessly but seem to cluster together into several areas of concern:
 
 Obsessions about the home
 
 Worry about harming others
 
 Obsessions having to do with unintentionally running someone over
 
 Personal health concerns
The next sections give examples of each area of concern.
Harming your home through negligence
One area of doubting involves concerns with harm befalling where you live. 
People with this concern worry about something terrible happening to their 
homes because of their own carelessness. The feelings of doubt are so 
intense that they lead to nearly endless loops of compulsive checking.
Those who are obsessed with such matters worry about fires breaking out, 
roofs falling in, and termites consuming their walls until they collapse. 
They worry about explosions from gas leaks and asphyxiation from carbon 
monoxide. They obsess about faucets that may have been left turned 
on resulting in flood damage. This type of OCD is difficult to overcome 
because you can never absolutely rule out the possibility of damage or harm 
occurring to your home — no matter how many times you check.
The following example illustrates the vicious cycle of Doubting and Checking 
OCD as it relates to household safety.
Carl turns the oven knob to the off position. Actually, he turns it on, then 
off, then on, and then off. He looks to make sure it is still off. He leaves the 
house. But he fears the knob may have slipped back on. He goes back 
inside and checks. It’s off. He leaves the house and gets in the car. But as 
he pulls out of the driveway, he wonders whether there’s a chance that 
the oven could still be on. Maybe, just maybe, he thinks, it is. He pulls 
back in, gets out of the car, and goes back in the house. Checks the knob. 
It’s off. Whew! He opens the oven door to see whether the oven is warm. 

201
 Chapter 13: Dealing with Doubting and Checking OCD
He thinks it is. He checks the knob. He closes the door. He checks the 
knob. He leaves the house. Gets into the car. Starts the car. Looks back. 
Was that smoke? Is the oven on? He stops the car. Goes back to the 
house. And checks everything all over again.
Just reading about Carl’s doubting is exhausting! The pattern is difficult to 
stop. Doubt, check, doubt, check. . . .
Harming others through negligence
Another concern of people with Doubting and Checking OCD is fear that their 
behavior or negligence will somehow harm someone else. The specific con-
tent of the fear ranges infinitely. But the belief is one of hyper-responsibility 
for other people’s welfare and safety. The afflicted person must constantly be 
on guard to make sure that something really bad doesn’t happen.
This type of OCD worry escalates, with sufferers taking more and more 
drastic steps to keep others safe. Their attempts to protect others consume 
more of their time as the concerns go on. The following example illustrates 
how someone with this type of OCD concern attempts to protect people, but 
actually accomplishes little or nothing for her efforts.
Naomi believes that she is responsible for warning her friends and family 
about bad weather. This problem gets worse after she hears about a 
child dying in a tornado that briefly touched down in her town. Her 
obsession causes her to constantly monitor the weather station. When 
there are reports of storms in the area, she calls each person on her list 
of 45 people. At first, she only calls when the storms are serious and 
imminent, but after a while she calls when there are mere threats of rain.
Friends and family no longer answer their phones when they see her 
number on the caller ID. She leaves messages when they fail to answer, 
but worries that the voice mail won’t get picked up in time. And if it isn’t, 
and someone gets hurt, she feels she will be personally responsible. She 
begins driving to the house of each person on her list who doesn’t 
answer the phone. Upon arriving, if no one answers the door, she leaves 
a note warning of the impending doom.
Naomi’s story shows how the sense of responsibility inflates to incredible 
proportions. There is virtually no end to the efforts people with this type of 
OCD will make in order to protect the safety and well-being of those they 
love. Sometimes they expend this energy on protecting perfect strangers. But 
these efforts require huge amounts of time and fail to add significant safety to 
the lives of those they worry about.

202
Part IV: Targeting Specific Symptoms of OCD 
Harming others with your 
car through negligence
The hit-and-run focus is actually a variant of the “harming others through 
negligence” concern discussed above. However, hit-and-run is such a 
common form of doubting and checking that it deserves some special 
attention. Those who dwell on hit-and-run issues greatly fear hitting someone 
with their car. Therefore, they interpret every bump in the road, unexpected 
honk, or random movement detected in their peripheral vision as evidence 
that they have run someone over.
Once they make that interpretation, they feel driven to go back and check on 
the victims or, more hopefully, find evidence that they did not actually cause 
a horrible accident. Sometimes they go back to the scene dozens of times — 
even causing them to be late. Additional ways these folks check on what they 
may have done include:
 
 Asking for reassurance from passengers in their car
 
 Calling hospital emergency rooms to inquire about recent arrivals
 
 Carefully rubbing the surface of their cars for signs of dents from 
an impact
 
 Listening to police scanners for calls on accidents
 
 Reading obituaries in the newspaper
 
 Scrutinizing the exterior of their cars for any signs of blood
No one really knows why this concern appears so often. Some have 
speculated that it stems from the importance of cars in modern society as 
well as the fact that automobiles cause many thousands of deaths and 
injuries each year.
Another contributor to the cause of Hit-and-Run OCD may be the fact that 
every so often a news story about someone backing out of the driveway and 
running over a child pops up in the newspaper or on TV. Almost always 
the person driving was unaware of the child’s presence and the act was a 
tragic accident.
The following exercise asks you to put yourself in the shoes of someone who 
has actually experienced such a tragedy. Doing so gives you an idea of what 
this type of OCD feels like to those who have it.
Imagine you are backing out of your driveway, maybe thinking about 
a grocery list or a dinner date. You feel a slight bump of the wheels. 
Then you hear the screams of neighbors. People are running toward your 

203
 Chapter 13: Dealing with Doubting and Checking OCD
car, pointing. The realization that something is horribly wrong floods 
your mind. You desperately wish that you could go back in time, but you 
can’t. You stop the car, open the door, and there, on the driveway, lies a 
lifeless child.
People with Hit-and-Run OCD repeatedly have such images — with feelings 
to match — most days of their lives. The horror seems real and the urge to 
check irresistible. Paradoxically, a few people with Hit-and-Run OCD have 
been hurt or caused real accidents because of their compulsive need to stop 
and turn around in traffic to check.
Harming your health through negligence
People with Doubting and Checking OCD frequently have excessive concerns 
about their own health or sometimes the health of loved ones. Usually the 
health fear is specific to one condition or disease and often makes little sense 
to others. The following example shows you how someone with this OCD 
concern thinks.
Jack believes that fibers from synthetic clothing contain carcinogenic 
material. He avoids wearing anything except cotton or wool. He calls 
stores and clothing manufacturers around the country asking about what 
types of thread they use for sewing on buttons. He inquires about the 
machines used to cut and sew the material to see if they are also used on 
the dreaded synthetic fabrics. If he is not fully assured that the machines 
are used only to manufacture natural materials into clothes, he won’t buy 
the brand in question.
He checks all fabric tags repeatedly before he puts on his clothes. He gets 
very upset when someone walks by too closely, fearing that synthetic 
fibers from clothes can jump from person to person. He monitors his 
body constantly for what he believes are possible signs of cancer, such 
as bloating, blemishes, swollen sinuses, and headaches.
Jack’s story may seem pretty wacky to you. But that’s how OCD works 
sometimes. OCD stories don’t always make a whole lot of logical sense. Other 
examples of people with OCD health concerns include:
 
 A mother frequently fears she may poison her children by undercooking 
their meat, so she routinely burns their dinner.
 
 A father worries about his kids’ health so much that he home-schools 
them to avoid exposure to contagions.

204
Part IV: Targeting Specific Symptoms of OCD 
 
 A teenage boy obsesses about being killed by natural disasters. He con-
vinces his parents to buy enough supplies to last for two months in case 
of an emergency. That’s not such a bad idea, but his OCD is revealed 
by the fact that the boy does an inventory of the supplies each day. He 
also pressures his parents to move to Nevada because it has a lower 
incidence of natural disasters than California, which is where they live.
Categorizing Approaches to Checking
The compulsion to check momentarily decreases doubt, and that feels like 
a relief. But the doubt quickly returns. That’s the nature of OCD. Checking 
is a very temporary solution because absolute certainty never replaces 
doubt. To the OCD mind, there is always a chance that something bad 
might happen. Over the long haul, continued checking produces increased 
uneasiness, frustration, and doubt.
Checking usually happens when the person with OCD is alone and further 
increases when the person feels stressed or unhappy. Checking falls into one 
of three forms: obvious or overt, mental, or assisted. The following sections 
describe each form in more detail.
Obvious or overt checking
These compulsions are active and can be seen — like clicking the car key 
fob again and again to make sure the car doors are locked or checking to see 
that the dryer is turned off. Obvious checking is also apparent when a driver 
turns around and goes back to the area where a bump in the road seemed 
suspicious. Another example of this type of checking is when a person scans 
the news for accident victims or repeatedly calls friends to make sure that 
they are okay.
Mental checking
Mental checking refers to thinking about or reviewing something over and 
over. Someone may think about all the details of driving to work repeatedly 
to check for the possibility of harming someone. Or, one may mentally review 
each step taken to make sure that the windows at home are closed. Still 
others may repeatedly review each conversation from the day in order to be 
sure that they said nothing offensive to anyone.

205
 Chapter 13: Dealing with Doubting and Checking OCD
Getting others to check
One way to get others to help check is simply to ask. A man might call his 
roommate and ask him to check and see that the stove is off. A woman might 
ask a passenger in the car if he felt that bump. Another way of getting others 
involved is through reassurance seeking (see Chapter 5). A woman might ask 
her spouse whether he thinks she looks sick. A child might repeatedly ask his 
parents whether they think the house will be safe from intruders.
Taking Steps to Defeat Doubting 
and Control Checking
Treating Doubting and Checking OCD is relatively straightforward. However, 
it takes effort, a willingness to do a few uncomfortable things, and persever-
ance. In addition, you need to be very self-observant in order to pick up 
on all the important nuances that your OCD may involve. The following five 
sections take you through a typical treatment game plan, step by step.
If you don’t feel ready to tackle your Doubting and Checking OCD, seriously 
consider reading Chapter 6 on overcoming resistance first. If the material in 
that chapter doesn’t make you feel fully prepared, consult a mental-health 
professional for assistance. You should also make an appointment with 
a professional if your own efforts begin to stall at any point.
Note: You need a notebook or something to write on as you work through the 
following steps.
1. Searching for signals, 
triggers, and avoidance
The first step in treating Doubting and Checking OCD involves a little 
detective work. You must monitor your environment, actions, and behaviors 
carefully in order to determine what triggers (problematic situations and 
events) set off your doubting and checking cycle. Assessing and listing 
anything and everything that you find yourself avoiding is a good way to 
discover these triggers. But try not to be too obsessional in your search.

206
Part IV: Targeting Specific Symptoms of OCD 
For example, if you have trouble leaving your home due to fear of burglaries, 
the need or desire to go out into the world may trigger a cascade of obses-
sions about the security of your doors and windows. Similarly, if you avoid 
watching television out of fear that you’ll fail to hear someone breaking 
in, then turning on the television and perhaps other noisy appliances may 
trigger your OCD. Additional common triggers for Doubting and Checking 
OCD include driving, traffic, being in crowds, sneezing, feeling nauseous, and 
listening to news stories. Actually, the list of possible triggers goes on and on 
and on, but for now, choose ten or so items from your list so you won’t feel 
overwhelmed. Write these items in your notebook.
Occasionally, your problematic triggers may seem to strike from out of the 
blue. However, usually when you look hard enough, you find something that 
likely triggered your OCD cycle. Typically, the trigger is a fairly clear-cut 
event or happening. Other times, it may be something a little more vague 
such as increased stress at work or having had a poor night’s sleep.
2. Identifying obsessional doubts
The second step in treating your Doubting and Checking OCD is to figure out 
what you fear will happen if you stop avoiding your OCD triggers. These fears 
constitute your obsessions or doubts. Usually, whatever consequence you 
fear is rather horrible. That’s why it’s so hard to give up on checking.
For example, if you went ahead and drove in congested areas and over 
speed bumps, what do you think the consequence would be? If you have hit-
and-run worries, the consequence is likely to be pretty clear — you fear that 
you will cause someone’s death or serious injury. Write down the obsessions 
or feared consequences of encountering your triggers in your notebook.
3. Compiling compulsions
A critical component of your Doubting and Checking OCD treatment is 
making a list of your compulsions. These compulsions include checking and 
safety behaviors. Checking compulsions involve all the things you do to see 
whether your worst fears have actually occurred or not, such as:
 
 Checking your locks
 
 Returning to the scene of a feared accident
 
 Going to the doctor to check out your latest physical symptom

 Chapter 13: Dealing with Doubting and Checking OCD
Safety behaviors are another type of compulsion and encompass things you 
do to prevent your fears from occurring. These include rituals such as check-
ing your stove exactly 14 times while counting out loud from 1 to 14. Other 
safety compulsions include repeating certain words or phrases to prevent 
bad things from happening and carrying lucky charms to accomplish the 
same goal. Safety behaviors often have a superstitious or magical flavor to 
them (see Chapter 17 for OCD that actually focuses on superstitions and 
other magical thinking).Write down your list of compulsions and safety 
behaviors in your notebook.
Robyn’s story illustrates how someone with severe Doubting and Checking 
OCD goes about finding the triggers, obsessions (feared consequences), and 
checking compulsions for her OCD cycle.
Robyn has Doubting and Checking OCD that focuses on worries about 
harming others with her car (see the section “Harming others with your 
car through negligence”). Her OCD has progressively worsened over 
the past few years. Today, she can rarely manage to drive anywhere at 
all. Robyn identifies the actual events, situations, and triggers for her 
hit-and-run concerns. She comes up with this list of triggers:
 
• Driving in congested areas
 
• Driving near bike lanes
 
• Driving near crosswalks
 
• Driving near sidewalks
 
• Driving on bumpy roads
 
• Driving with passengers in the car due to the distraction
 
• Going over speed bumps
Robyn ponders the obsessional fears that she believes will occur if she 
stops avoiding her OCD triggers. The answer is pretty obvious — she 
assumes that the likelihood of her harming or killing someone with her 
car will skyrocket. 
She reflects on the following obsessions or feared consequences of 
encountering her OCD triggers:
 
1. She runs someone over.
 
2. The police pull her over and arrest her.
 
3. She is driven to jail in handcuffs.
 
4. She appears in court.

208
Part IV: Targeting Specific Symptoms of OCD 
 
5. She is found guilty of negligent manslaughter, and is sentenced to ten 
years in jail.
These obsessions cause Robyn to engage in an array of compulsive checking. 
She does this by:
 
 Returning to the place of the perceived accident over and over again 
until she feels she can go on
 
 Examining the exterior of her car for an hour twice each week
 
 Having her car washed twice a week to facilitate her examination
Her compulsions also include safety behaviors:
 
 She drives only on certain uncongested roadways.
 
 She repeats the words “break a leg” as she drives.
 
 She drives five miles an hour below the speed limit.
With these lists of triggers, obsessions, and compulsions in hand, Robyn is 
prepared to take on the next step in her OCD treatment — disputing doubts.
4. Disputing obsessional doubts
If you suffer from the doubting and checking type of OCD, it is distressing for 
you. This type of OCD centers on obsessional worries about caring for 
others, keeping the home safe, and staying healthy. Checking feels like a 
logical response because the imagined consequences of harming others, 
watching a home burn down, or becoming seriously ill are harsh. The fact 
that you and others with this type of OCD may resist direct challenges to 
these worries is understandable. Resistance is a common response to 
exposure and response prevention (ERP) therapy (see the next section).
However, if you start by learning to rethink the way you view doubt, you 
may feel better prepared to undergo ERP (which is the next step). OCD 
doubts are not based on evidence. In contrast, realistic doubts stem from log-
ical information. To help you figure out whether your doubts are realistic or 
based on your OCD, ask yourself the following questions (see Chapter 8 for 
more on this and other strategies for rethinking doubts):
 
 Are your doubts based on direct information from your senses 
(sight, sound, smell, taste, or touch)? Most OCD doubts are not based 
on one’s senses.

209
 Chapter 13: Dealing with Doubting and Checking OCD
 
 Does your doubt seem to have a life of its own and keep coming back, 
even without new evidence to support it? OCD doubts typically do 
continually return over and over without fresh evidence.
 
 Is there anything about your doubt that other people would see as 
illogical? If your doubt is OCD, people likely see it as very illogical.
 
 Is there anything that would convince you that your doubt is likely 
false? If you have OCD, you likely can’t be convinced that your doubt is 
false, no matter what the evidence says.
 
Obsessional doubts come from your OCD mind. They are not grounded by 
rational thinking. If your doubts persist in spite of contradictory evidence, 
then OCD is at work.
For example, in the preceding section we discussed Robyn, whose obses-
sional doubts center on the fear of running someone over with her car, being 
arrested, and going to jail. Following are her answers to these questions:
 
 Are your doubts based on direct information from your senses 
(sight, sound, smell, taste, or touch)?
 
 I’ve never experienced hitting someone with my car, so I guess I don’t have 
any direct information about these doubts.
 
 Does your doubt seem to have a life of its own and keep coming back, 
even without new evidence to support it?
 
 Yes, my worry continues even when I avoid lots of dangerous intersections 
and congested traffic. I’ve had no accidents and nothing has happened 
that logically would suggest that I might be at special risk for running 
someone over.
 
 Is there anything about your doubt that other people would see as 
illogical?
 
 I don’t talk about this with most people. But my close friends think it’s 
pretty crazy. I guess I don’t talk about it with more people because I know 
they would think it’s crazy.
 
 Is there anything that would convince you that your doubt is 
likely false?
 
 I’ve never thought about this question before. I guess I can’t think of 
anything that would make me stop believing in my worries.
Robyn reviews her answers and concludes that it’s pretty obvious that her 
doubts are coming from her OCD mind. She still feels wary, but is now more 
willing to consider that these doubts are groundless. And she feels more 
prepared to engage in ERP, as discussed in the next section.

5. Applying ERP to doubting and checking
 
In Chapter 10, we discuss ERP in depth. Please read that chapter prior to 
attempting to use ERP for your Doubting and Checking OCD. It contains 
step-by-step ERP instructions and guides for troubleshooting problems.
Here we provide you with three sample exposure hierarchies or staircases 
relevant to Doubting and Checking OCD. See Chapter 10 for more about con-
structing hierarchies and staircases and assigning Ugh Factor Ratings to 
obsessions for virtually any OCD concerns.
Hit-and-Run OCD exposure staircase
As discussed earlier in this chapter, the fear of hitting someone with your car 
is a relatively common form of Doubting and Checking OCD. Robyn’s example 
in the preceding two sections typifies this concern.
She and her psychologist work out an exposure staircase together, as 
shown in Figure 13-1. Notice that they include a couple of imaginary steps. 
Obviously someone with this OCD concern cannot use exposure steps of 
actually running over a pedestrian! After she completes her hierarchy, she 
carries out ERP as discussed in Chapter 10.

Going over speed bumps (70 Ugh Factor Rating)
Driving near bike lanes (80 Ugh Factor Rating)
Driving in congested areas (85 Ugh Factor Rating)
Imagining the worst case – hitting someone and going to jail (90 Ugh Factor Rating)
Burning down the house
Fears about home safety dominate the thoughts of some people with 
Doubting and Checking OCD. If this reflects your concerns, here’s a sample 
hierarchy for developing a staircase. Please realize that your own specific 
hierarchy or staircase could contain a very different list of specific items with 
different Ugh Factor Ratings.
 
 Imagining the house burning down (95 Ugh Factor Rating)
 
 Leaving the coffeepot unattended and turned on (with coffee in it) for 
one hour (90 Ugh Factor Rating)
 
 Imagining a small kitchen fire (85 Ugh Factor Rating)

211
 Chapter 13: Dealing with Doubting and Checking OCD
 
 Imagining someone actually breaking into the house (80 Ugh Factor 
Rating)
 
 Locking the doors and leaving the house without checking the locks 
(75 Ugh Factor Rating)
 
 Checking the door locks only once when leaving the house (60 Ugh 
Factor Rating)
 
 Checking the door locks only twice when leaving the house (50 Ugh 
Factor Rating)
 
 Leaving the toaster oven plugged in (40 Ugh Factor Rating)
 
 Leaving the coffeepot plugged in at night (35 Ugh Factor Rating)
 
 Leaving the television plugged in (25 Ugh Factor Rating)
Healthy or not
Fears about the state of one’s health plague the minds of some of those with 
Doubting and Checking OCD. Here’s a sample exposure hierarchy for this 
concern. Your particular list could contain very different items and ratings.
 
 Imagining dying a slow, painful death from cancer (90 Ugh Factor Rating)
 
 Exercising intensely with an elevated heart rate (85 Ugh Factor Rating)
 
 Volunteering at a hospice (85 Ugh Factor Rating)
 
 Exercising moderately with a slightly elevated heart rate (80 Ugh 
Factor Rating)
 
 Being around old people (75 Ugh Factor Rating)
 
 Imagining coming down with a serious, chronic illness (70 Ugh Factor 
Rating)
 
 Failing to check yourself for injuries after handling sharp knives (65 Ugh 
Factor Rating)
 
 Going for a week without asking anyone for reassurance about your 
health (60 Ugh Factor Rating)
 
 Going for a day without asking anyone for reassurance about your 
health (50 Ugh Factor Rating)
 
 Not taking your blood pressure for a day (40 Ugh Factor Rating)
 
 Not listening to your heart with a stethoscope for a week (25 Ugh 
Factor Rating)
Check with your healthcare provider once for clearance on any items that 
call for changing your exercise or monitoring your health status. Don’t keep 
going back to the doctor for reassurance about these issues.

Chapter 14
Subduing OCD-Driven Shame
In This Chapter
 Reviewing the types of shame
 Changing shameful thinking
 Exposing and experimenting with shame
G
enerally speaking, those with OCD are unusually caring, moral, 
kind, and decent folks. Unfortunately, those with a type of OCD 
called Shaming OCD believe quite the opposite of themselves. Their minds 
fill up with obsessional images involving blatantly immoral, shameful, 
inappropriate, and humiliating actions. They believe that because those 
images enter their minds, they will actually put those thoughts into actions.
People with Shaming OCD feel so ashamed of their thoughts that they often 
keep them secret. Therefore, many people with this problem suffer for years 
and fail to seek help. That’s a shame, because treatment works.
In this chapter, we describe the major themes of Shaming OCD, and we 
tell you how to go about treating this problem. We discuss ways to think 
differently about your worries. Then we show you how to behave in ways 
that help tackle your Shaming OCD.
 
This chapter includes examples involving gruesome and horrific scenes. We 
are not trying to be sensational or to shock you. The reason we include this 
material is because people with OCD often have these terrible thoughts and 
worry that this means they may be dangerous or crazy. If you are plagued by 
gruesome obsessions, realize that you are not insane or a terrible person — 
you have Shaming OCD.
Surveying Shaming OCD
Shaming OCD draws on a deep well of self-distrust. People afflicted with this 
problem vary greatly in terms of the specific themes upon which they base 
their concerns. However, they all share a profound fear that they may act in 

214
Part IV: Targeting Specific Symptoms of OCD 
ways that will bring them great shame. Thus, one person may believe that 
she is likely to kill all her loved ones, another may think he will sexually 
abuse children, and someone else may imagine that she is an immoral sinner 
who offends God.
In the sections that follow, we review the three most common areas of 
concern for those who suffer from Shaming OCD. Those concerns are
 
 Fearing loss of control
 
 Questioning sexual identity
 
 Adhering to extreme religious rules (scrupulosity)
Being afraid of losing control
Many of those with Shaming OCD fear that their thoughts will ultimately 
turn into actions. They envision themselves acting out uncontrollably. 
Three areas stand out as concerns for those with the losing-control issue — 
aggression, sexually acting out, and losing control of bodily functions 
in public.
When horrible thoughts come into their minds, people with this type of OCD 
become very judgmental and self-critical. They often say to themselves, “If I 
have these bad thoughts, then I must be a bad person.”
Shame versus guilt
Feelings of shame and guilt are reminders that 
some action or behavior is not acceptable — 
either morally, legally, or ethically. Although 
both emotions are negative, they help people 
know when they have done something wrong. 
Most people use the words shame and guilt 
pretty much interchangeably. However, social 
scientists usually make a distinction between 
the unpleasant emotions of shame and guilt.
Shame is a personal feeling about one’s self 
and is usually all-encompassing: “I am ashamed 
of myself” thus means, “I am a bad person.” 
People who are ashamed tend to avoid others, 
get angry, or become depressed. They appear 
to be less likely to do something positive to 
make up for their deeds. On the other hand, guilt 
is more specific and adaptive: “I feel guilty that 
I ran that red light. Next time I’ll try to pay 
more attention,” or “I feel guilty about getting 
angry with my brother.” Those who feel guilty 
are more likely to try to fix the problem or do 
something to make amends.
The bottom line is that a little guilt isn’t all that 
bad as long as it motivates you to do better in 
the future. If you feel guilty here and there, 
you probably have a good, well-functioning 
conscience. By contrast, shame is rarely help-
ful because it doesn’t point the way to improved 
behavior.

215
 Chapter 14: Subduing OCD-Driven Shame
Struggling with thoughts of aggression
Thinking you may be a mass murderer is a whole lot better than actually 
being a mass murderer. But, even the contemplation that you may lose 
control and harm someone else can be quite disturbing.
People with this concern worry that they will snap and do something terrible 
to someone else. The target of the aggressive impulse could be a stranger or 
a loved one. Some common worries include
 
 What if I am swimming and I hold my child’s head under water?
 
 What if I kill my pet?
 
 What if I push down someone who is handicapped?
 
 What if I slap my boss?
 
 What if I walk near a knife, pick it up, and stab someone?
Baby obsessions
The birth of a baby is a time of great joy for most 
families. It is also a time when many new par-
ents experience obsessive thoughts. A study at 
the Mayo Clinic reported that more than a third 
of new mothers and more than half of new 
fathers experience these temporary obses-
sions. The obsessions are repugnant and con-
tradict the parents’ love and concern for their 
child. Thoughts can be accompanied by vivid 
images. Thoughts usually center around health, 
safety issues, intentional harm, sexual thoughts, 
and worries about contamination.
  Am I sexually attracted to this baby?
  What if I abuse the baby?
  What if I am walking by a sharp object and 
stab the baby?
  What if I drop the baby?
  What if I fall down the stairs and kill the 
baby?
  What if my baby catches a disease because 
I didn’t clean properly after changing?
  What if the baby slides down into the water 
and drowns?
The increased responsibility of caring for a 
newborn child and the stress involved (not to 
mention sleepless nights) are believed to 
make this a prime time for the mind to generate 
these weird thoughts. Obsessions about 
harming a baby usually don’t last long. They do 
not become diagnosable OCD unless the 
thoughts become increasingly frequent, lead to 
significant distress, and involve considerable 
amounts of time.
Obsessional thoughts about harming a baby are 
almost never carried out. People are generally 
frightened and disgusted by obsessions. Having 
these thoughts means nothing about the person. 
However, there are extremely rare cases that 
involve loss of touch with reality and irrational 
thinking in which violence can occur. Anytime 
obsessional thoughts feel out of control 
or very disturbing, please seek help from a 
mental-health professional.

216
Part IV: Targeting Specific Symptoms of OCD 
Wrestling thoughts of acting out sexually
One common concern of those with Shaming OCD is the fear that they may 
act out sexually deviant behavior at some point. We aren’t just talking about 
acceptable, though perhaps unusual, sexual practices between consenting 
adults. When OCD is involved, the feared sexual acts are typically considered 
highly immoral by the sufferer and even dangerously illegal. Some of the top 
worries of those with Shaming OCD involving sexual concerns include
 
 Thoughts about pedophilia: This issue involves worrying that one 
may sexually abuse a child. Mind you, these people do not want to abuse 
a child and actually find the idea utterly abhorrent. However, they 
have obsessional thoughts about the possibility and constantly check 
on themselves to determine whether this could really happen. They 
interpret minor, meaningless bodily sensations in the genital region 
as proof positive that they actually are aroused by children. These 
concerns often cause them to avoid being around playgrounds, schools, 
and other places where children congregate.
 
 Thoughts about rape: Those with this concern fear that they may lose 
control and rape someone. Although occasional rape fantasies are not 
uncommon, most people don’t worry that they’ll actually act them 
out. Those with Shaming OCD who have this problem have a different 
perspective. They believe that even a brief image of a rape scene 
floating through their minds means they are at real risk of acting it 
out. Therefore, these folks often avoid being around anyone they can 
imagine raping.
 
 Thoughts about bestiality: People who worry about this issue believe 
that they may actually engage in sex with an animal. They respond to 
any thought or image about sex with animals as though it means they 
are actually sexually attracted to animals. Like those with concerns 
about rape and pedophilia, these people find their thoughts about sex 
with animals disgusting. They typically avoid being around animals in 
order to control their imagined urges.
Worrying over losing control of bodily functions
Another interesting theme among those with Shaming OCD is the fear of 
losing control of bodily functions. Those with this affliction fear doing one of 
the following two distressing things:
 
 Losing bladder or bowel control in public. People suffering with this 
OCD issue constantly fret that they may wet or mess themselves in a 
public place. This feeling of uncertainty plagues people with elimination 
obsessions. The thoughts and accompanying feelings become so 
pressing that going out is avoided as much as possible. They monitor 
their bodies for slight changes and believe that they won’t be able to 
control themselves.

217
 Chapter 14: Subduing OCD-Driven Shame
 
 When forced to leave the house, their first step is to find the nearest 
bathroom. They end up going to the bathroom at every opportunity — 
even when it’s completely unnecessary — just to avoid having a 
humiliating accident.
 
 Vomiting spontaneously in public. Others with Shaming OCD obsess 
about the possibility of vomiting in public. Images come into their minds 
of uncontrollable projectile vomiting in crowded restaurants, at work, or 
in class.
 
 To avoid such horrific happenings, those plagued with this concern 
often stop eating out. They also avoid other possible triggers for their 
concerns, such as opening their mouths to speak in public. These 
avoidance behaviors can make them seem strange. Finally, they com-
monly resort to safety behaviors such as taking antacids and anti-nausea 
drugs prior to going out.
Questioning established sexual identity
The sexual identity theme in Shaming OCD calls the very essence of a 
person’s sexuality into question. Unlike the fear of sexually acting out, this 
worry does not involve aggressive or illegal acts. However, those with 
this torment feel considerable shame and distress, because the obsessional 
fears raise questions about their established sexual identity. These fears 
and thoughts are irrational and come out of the blue.
The example that follows describes someone with this issue.
Estabelle, a happily married woman, begins to wonder whether she’s 
gay. The woman enjoys a healthy sexual relationship with her husband 
but worries that she is attracted to other women. She starts to study her-
self for signs that she is aroused by women. She begins looking at lesbian 
pornography to see if she finds it arousing — and interprets almost any 
thought or bodily change as evidence of her newfound orientation. She 
constantly asks her husband for reassurance that he finds her attractive. 
She is so self-conscious about her sexuality that she finds herself dis-
tracted during sex. For the first time, she is unable to have an orgasm. 
This problem gives her OCD more fuel to question her sexual orientation.
Estabelle’s example portrays someone who feels ashamed and extremely 
confused by the possibility that she may be gay. She is not aroused by 
thoughts of sexual encounters with women. These thoughts seem to 
have come out of the blue. Her obsessions are unwanted, frequent, and 
uncontrolled. And she’s not gay.

218
Part IV: Targeting Specific Symptoms of OCD 
Being homosexual is not a sign of an emotional problem. However, having 
obsessions about being gay — when you’re not — is considered a form 
of OCD. People with this problem usually have some strategies to deal 
with their obsessions. Some repeatedly ask for reassurance from others 
about being gay or looking gay. Some challenge themselves by looking 
at pornography or going to gay bars. Many avoid situations in which they 
think they may be tempted to act on their thoughts. These coping strategies 
can be considered compulsive.
Taking religious or moral 
beliefs to the extreme
The category of Shaming OCD that deals with religion involves adhering to an 
overly demanding religious or moral code. Those with this form of “religious” 
Shaming OCD, which is also known as scrupulosity, obsess over perceived 
sins, fear losing control of their behavior in religiously inappropriate ways, 
or endlessly fret over failing to please God. They attempt to relieve the 
obsessions through compulsive acts such as praying, chanting, asking for 
reassurance, or confessing. Scrupulosity takes many forms; the following are 
a few examples:
 
 A woman repeats Bible verses over and over because she doubts that 
she says them correctly.
 
 A man at church sees a statue of the Virgin Mary and imagines having 
sex with her. Now he finds that every time he goes to church he has sim-
ilar thoughts and images. He believes that merely having these thoughts 
is blasphemous. He frequently goes to confession for reassurance, 
which helps for only a short time.
 
 During Yom Kippur, a woman discovers that she has mindlessly chewed 
on the end of her pencil. Because her religion calls for fasting during 
this time, she believes that she has sinned. She views many such 
“transgressions” similarly.
 
 A teenager sits through church service believing that he will suddenly 
shout out obscenities against God. He resists going to church because 
of this fear, but then feels he has committed a horrible sin by not going 
to church.
Scrupulosity can also involve slavish adherence to moral codes that are not 
based on religion. These codes of conduct go far beyond what most people 
consider necessary. Thus, those with this concern may review all their 
actions for the slightest hint of a possible indiscretion or wrongdoing. Some 
rebuke themselves for giving a compliment that is not 100 percent true. 

219
 Chapter 14: Subduing OCD-Driven Shame
Others think they’ve committed an unforgiveable act if they fail to count their 
change from a cashier and later realize that they walked away with a nickel 
too much change.
Treating Shaming OCD
Shaming OCD involves thoughts, feelings, and behavior. The thoughts are 
usually distorted and highly judgmental. The feelings include self-disgust, 
shame, humiliation, anxiety, and guilt. Rarely, if ever, does anyone actually 
act out the behaviors they fear they will. Instead, they avoid situations they 
think could lead them into trouble. They engage in various safety behaviors 
and compulsive attempts to neutralize their obsessive thoughts.
Treatment targets both thoughts and behaviors — with the result being an 
improvement in the way the person feels. The following two sections discuss 
specific strategies designed to treat Shaming OCD thinking and behaving, 
respectively.
Changing OCD thinking by 
challenging the evidence
The primary approach to changing your Shaming OCD thoughts is what’s 
known as “checking the evidence.” This strategy has also been successfully 
applied to other emotional problems, such as depression and anxiety. It is 
particularly useful for Shaming OCD because the thinking component of this 
type of OCD is especially prominent.
Checking the evidence involves carefully reviewing and responding to a 
variety of questions that help you to challenge your OCD-related thoughts. 
These questions include the following:
 
 Do people I like and respect sometimes have bad thoughts too? (Hint: If 
you don’t know, consider asking a few very trusted friends.)
 
 Have any of my obsessions gone up and down in frequency and intensity 
over time? If so, what happened in terms of my actual behavior, and why 
do I think my obsessions varied over time?
 
 How many times have my thoughts actually caused me to engage in 
unacceptable behavior?
 
 What would happen if I used the same standards for myself that I have 
for other people?

220
Part IV: Targeting Specific Symptoms of OCD 
 
 What would I tell a good friend of mine who told me about having 
thoughts just like mine?
 
 When I am excessively critical of myself, do I end up feeling better 
or worse?
We encourage you to take some time considering these questions and writing 
out your answers. Keep a copy of your answers handy. When you have an 
obsessive thought, take a look at your responses. Read them out loud. Don’t 
expect an immediate change; continue to work by completing the behavioral 
exercises in the section that follows on ERP. Here’s an example that repre-
sents how someone with Shaming OCD may respond to the questions:
Tamara, the mother of a 10-month-old boy, had been treated for 
Contamination OCD as a teenager and had recovered. She began having 
strange thoughts shortly after the birth of her baby. She changes a 
diaper and notices a rash. The thought that the rash is caused by her 
sexually abusing him flashes in her mind. After that first thought, she 
feels disgusted and repulsed. But why would that thought come to her 
mind? Maybe she wants to abuse him, or maybe she is sexually aroused 
by him. She starts to avoid looking at his genitals when she changes him, 
but this leads to her not getting him clean and his rash gets worse. He 
gets more and more fussy. Tamara can barely make herself hold him 
because she fears that she will act on her obsessions. Tamara’s mind 
floods with horrible images and thoughts.
Her family members notice how disturbed she is becoming and suggest 
she check in with her former therapist. Her therapist explains that she 
has had a relapse of her OCD. He tells her that because she responded 
to treatment before, she will likely get better fast. Together, they collect 
evidence regarding her new obsession. Here are her answers:
 
 Do people I like and respect sometimes have bad thoughts too?
 
 I know a lot of people have OCD. And I read in OCD For Dummies that 
most people sometimes have thoughts that are just like the thoughts that 
those of us with OCD have. So probably most of my friends have similar 
thoughts here and there. They just don’t take them as seriously as my OCD 
mind does.
 
 Have any of my obsessions gone up and down in frequency and 
intensity over time? If so, what happened in terms of my actual 
behavior, and why do I think my obsessions varied over time?
 
 Oh, yes. At one time I was afraid of contamination from all kinds of 
things — dirt, oil, food, you name it. I think stress had something to do 
with it. In any case, I guess I can see it’s “all just OCD.”
 
 How many times have my thoughts actually caused me to engage in 
unacceptable behavior?
 
 Well, in truth, it’s never actually happened. I don’t absolutely know that it 
won’t, but it hasn’t yet.

221
 Chapter 14: Subduing OCD-Driven Shame
 
 What would happen if I used the same standards for myself that I have 
for other people?
 
 I never thought of that. I suppose it would make me less self-critical. Maybe 
my OCD would drop a little too.
 
 What would I tell a good friend of mine who told me about having 
thoughts just like mine?
 
 I would tell a friend that she was just having OCD. My OCD from the past 
tells me that much. I’d tell her to repeat “There goes my OCD again” each 
time she had those thoughts.
 
 When I am excessively critical of myself, do I end up feeling better 
or worse?
 
 Definitely worse. My OCD jumps up and I just spiral down. I guess trying to 
be more self-forgiving might help.
After completing the “checking the evidence” questions, Tamara feels 
significant relief. She still has work to do in therapy, but feels more 
emboldened to take on her OCD. She and her therapist work on some of 
the techniques described in the next sections.
Using ERP to change shaming 
OCD behavior
Changing your OCD-related behavior is probably the most powerful way to 
combat your Shaming OCD. The primary tool in your OCD toolkit is seen 
throughout this book and is called exposure and response prevention (ERP).
 
We cover ERP in considerable detail in Chapter 10. Please read that chapter 
thoroughly before you proceed further. There you will see exactly how to 
carry out ERP and what to do if and when you encounter trouble.
The purpose of this section is to present you with several ERP hierarchies 
(or staircases) for use with ERP. ERP hierarchies are lists. ERP staircases are 
pictorial representations of the hierarchies. Each places the item with the 
lowest Ugh Factor Rating at the bottom and moves progressively up the 
hierarchy or staircase, so the item with the highest Ugh Factor is at the top.
 
You won’t know what to do with these hierarchies unless you read about ERP 
in Chapter 10 first. If you were to attempt something without that information, 
you could easily make things worse for yourself. And please see a professional 
trained in ERP if you encounter any snags or difficulty. Finally, consult a 
professional if you have scrupulosity OCD or any Shaming OCD issues that 
concern illegal or highly immoral acts. You need a proper diagnosis as well as 
careful guidance — but you can be helped! For religious issues, your therapist 
may want to collaborate with a spiritual advisor.

Part IV: Targeting Specific Symptoms of OCD 
Losing bladder or bowel control in public
If worries about urinating and/or defecating in public pervade your mind, 
here’s an ERP hierarchy involving this theme. Please realize that your 
personal concerns will vary somewhat (or even greatly) from these items. 
However, reviewing this sample should help you devise your own hierarchy.
Some people struggle with various medical conditions that may cause actual 
embarrassing moments. If that’s the case for you, various medical treatment 
options may be available. Unfortunately, for some, the only solution is the 
use of adult diapers. These do manage to control the embarrassment, but we 
recommend checking into medical treatments first.
Some people with this form of OCD wear adult diapers not because of any 
medical condition, but to protect themselves from their worries about 
accidents — which they typically have never experienced. That’s why we 
include going without adult diapers in our hierarchy — this is not advice for 
someone with a true medical condition to follow.
 
 Imagine peeing in my pants in a crowded mall — everyone stares (90 
Ugh Factor Rating)
 
 Go to a public restroom without checking myself for possible “drips” 
(80 Ugh Factor Rating)
 
 Get on an airplane without going to the bathroom within 20 minutes of 
takeoff (75 Ugh Factor Rating)
 
 Go without adult diapers for an entire day (60 Ugh Factor Rating)
 
 Go out in public after drinking two full glasses of water (55 Ugh Factor 
Rating)
 
 Avoid going to the bathroom when out in the world for at least 30 
minutes (45 Ugh Factor Rating)
 
 Go to a new mall without looking on the map for the restrooms (45 Ugh 
Factor Rating)
 
 Go to a restaurant without asking where the restroom is (35 Ugh 
Factor Rating)
 
 Avoid going to the bathroom for an hour while out in public (30 Ugh 
Factor Rating)
 
 Go without adult diapers for one hour (25 Ugh Factor Rating)
 
Don’t get so compulsive with your ERP that you actually cause yourself severe 
pain and distress from avoiding voiding.

223
 Chapter 14: Subduing OCD-Driven Shame
Notice that a hierarchy can contain items that occur only in the mind as well 
as some that you actually carry out. That’s because carrying some of these 
situations out with real actions would indeed be pretty darned embarrassing! 
Fortunately, you don’t have to venture out into the world and truly pee in 
your pants.
Vomiting in public
Now it’s time to review a nauseating hierarchy. Just for the record, we’re 
pretty sure that most people don’t especially enjoy vomiting. However, those 
with this kind of Shaming OCD worry about vomiting every day. They avoid 
eating out and anything else that could possibly make them feel nauseous 
and vomit.
 
It is possible that carrying out this exposure hierarchy could result in you 
becoming somewhat nauseous and even vomiting. If a given staircase item 
starts to make you quite nauseous, you may want to back away from that stair 
and try an easier one. However, it’s okay if you get nauseous or vomit. People 
do vomit, and the consequences of doing so are not nearly as horrific as 
your OCD mind tells you. If you find the tasks too scary, enlist the help of a 
professional.
 
 Put “vomit soup” in your mouth and spit it out — see sidebar for special 
recipe and instructions! (100 Ugh Factor Rating)
 
 Imagine walking into an alley behind a bar late at night and inhaling the 
smells (90 Ugh Factor Rating)
 
 Imagine vomiting on a subway train and causing everyone else to start 
vomiting (90 Ugh Factor Rating)
 
 Actually imitate vomiting/gagging sounds (85 Ugh Factor Rating)
 
 Actually listen to tapes of gagging sounds (80 Ugh Factor Rating)
 
 Actually go on an amusement park ride that spins (75 Ugh Factor Rating)
 
 Actually look at pictures of vomit on the Internet (60 Ugh Factor Rating)
 
 Actually let your mouth fill with saliva (55 Ugh Factor Rating)
 
 Actually go out to eat at a restaurant and eat the entire meal (55 Ugh 
Factor Rating)
 
 Actually spin in an office chair (55 Ugh Factor Rating)
 
 Imagine vomiting in your own bathroom (45 Ugh Factor Rating)
 
 Actually pull your stomach muscles in and out rapidly (35 Ugh 
Factor Rating)

Complementary Treatments 
for OCD Shaming
The preceding strategies are your primary tools for use against Shaming 
OCD. However, we’ve found a few techniques to be useful add-ons. You can 
think of these techniques as experiments. Try them out and see what data 
comes in.
Revealing to others
Those with Shaming OCD usually hide their OCD thoughts from others. They 
work hard to conceal what they label as their hidden shame. That’s because 
they’re convinced that others would be repulsed and/or would reject them 
outright.
However, hiding your Shaming OCD prevents you from hearing a more 
reasonable perspective. Therefore, we suggest that you start by marshaling 
your courage and finding a therapist. Therapists are highly trained in being 
nonjudgmental.
Eeew, gross: Vomit soup
If you can carry out this instruction, you’re very 
likely to make great strides with your vomiting-
in-public worries. Note that this item lies at the 
very top of the vomit exposure hierarchy. 
Some therapists with considerable expertise in 
treating this issue concoct a brew that has 
much the same look and feel of vomit. Here’s 
our own recipe.
The base of any good vomit recipe is soup. You 
can choose your own brand. We recommend a 
vegetable soup such as green pea, minestrone, 
or plain old vegetable. Make sure the soup has 
some color and good chunks in it. Next, you 
need a little more texture. Soft curd cottage 
cheese is always good. Exact portions are not 
important, but a little more than a quarter cup is 
enough. Add a little carbonated beverage of 
your choice to give the mix a few bubbles (we 
don’t recommend champagne for this one 
unless you’re also trying to give that up).
Mix some of this lovely potion up. Then fill your 
mouth with it while in a bathroom. Roll it around, 
make a good gagging sound and spit it out into 
a toilet. If you spill a bit on the toilet seat, that’s 
great. This is true exposure. Repeat as needed 
until your anxiety drops significantly or until you 
can’t stop laughing. Yum.

225
 Chapter 14: Subduing OCD-Driven Shame
Once you reveal your hidden thoughts to a therapist, the two of you can 
work out a plan to open up with a few highly trusted people in your life as 
well. Doing so enables you to see whether they interpret your OCD thoughts 
in a more benign, less judgmental way. If you open up with three or four 
close, trusted friends, the odds are you’ll see that they attach less signifi-
cance to your thoughts than you do. Hopefully, this information will help you 
see that your thoughts are not as meaningful as actions and that they stem 
from the OCD part of your mind.
 
Of course, it’s always possible that you may pick a judgmental, rejecting 
person to reveal your thoughts to. But accepting a degree of uncertainty is 
part of treating OCD. If you do encounter a bad reaction, a therapist can help 
you through the incident. And one final word of advice: Don’t continually seek 
the counsel of others because doing so can morph into reassurance seeking — 
something we frequently warn against.
Experimenting with being “off duty”
Most people with Shaming OCD vigilantly monitor their thoughts and behav-
iors in order to prevent themselves from actually carrying out their feared, 
shameful actions. They mistakenly believe that it is only this monitoring that 
stands in the way of them engaging in one of these acts, such as shouting out 
obscenities in church, acting out sexually, or vomiting in public.
We owe a debt of gratitude to Dr. Stanley Rachman for the following idea. He 
suggests experimenting with periods of “off duty” for this type of OCD. “Off 
duty” is a time span during which you consciously cease vigilant monitoring 
of yourself for the possibility that you might engage in some shameful act. 
You can start with an hour in which you decide not to monitor yourself at all. 
Then try extending that time period to three hours, a full day, and so on.
After each “off duty” period of time, jot down whether anything catastrophic 
occurred or whether you actually lost control. Then try experimenting with 
times of “ultra vigilance.” During those times, try to control and actively 
monitor every single thought and action. After the “ultra vigilance” period, 
jot down whether you felt safer and whether you felt more in control or out 
of control.
Most of the time, this experiment leads people to conclude that their 
excessive vigilance does nothing to protect them. It doesn’t make them feel 
safer or better. In fact, most people feel much worse during their periods of 
“ultra vigilance.” The paradoxical lesson from this exercise is that you will 
feel more in control as you let go of your need to be in control.

226
Part IV: Targeting Specific Symptoms of OCD 
Experimenting with self-critical 
versus self-accepting views
Those afflicted with Shaming OCD almost always believe that they suffer from 
severe deficiencies in control and morality. They seem to believe they are 
inherently defective as human beings. They manage to “prove” their inherent 
defectiveness by examining everything they do from a highly critical, 
judgmental perspective.
But what would happen if you experimented with turning this cycle on its 
head? That’s what we ask you to do here. First, designate a full day to engag-
ing in harsh, critical scrutiny of each and every thing you do. For example, 
right now, we could beat up on ourselves for not typing fast enough or failing 
to word each sentence in the best possible way. Similarly, you could berate 
yourself for failing to read fast enough or understand the full meaning of each 
word and sentence.
Jot down notes here and there during your “critical” day. Notice how you 
feel and whether your Shaming OCD concerns increase or decrease. We’re 
betting that your concerns will rise.
Then choose a full day in which you decide to view yourself in a neutral, 
benign way. When you have OCD thoughts, merely say to yourself, “There 
goes my OCD mind again, how interesting.” If a disturbing image floats 
through your mind, do the same. If you make a mistake, say, “I guess that 
makes me human.” View all your OCD thoughts as though they are as 
meaningless as particles of dust.
Again, jot down notes on how you feel during your neutral, self-accepting 
day. See if you feel better or worse when you drop your self-critical stance. 
If you feel better, and we think you will, consider extending these periods 
to a week, then a month, and, ultimately, for the rest of your life.

Chapter 15
Messing with “Just So” OCD
In This Chapter
 Working to make things just right
 Getting stuck with symmetry
 Thinking differently about order
 Messing things up
S
ymmetry refers to pleasing balance and proportionality. Symmetry is 
found in classical art and architecture. Faces, leaves, and butterfly wings 
are generally balanced and symmetrical. People normally feel comfortable 
when surrounded by order and symmetry. Having a place for everything and 
seeing everything in its place can be reasonably satisfying. But, life has a way 
with messing with our neatly ordered garages, kitchens, and office desks. 
Most people are okay with this.
Some people with OCD crave order and symmetry all the time in everything. 
They are not satisfied or comfortable until certain things are done or ordered 
correctly, precisely, or “just so.” Their concerns vary; some arrange books or 
cupboards; others rewrite letters or numbers. However, they share the same 
feeling of discomfort when things don’t feel right, “just so,” or complete.
In this chapter, we describe the common concerns of those with what we call 
“Just So” OCD. Then we tell you how to change your thinking surrounding 
this type of OCD. Changing your thinking helps you prepare for changing your 
behaviors. After you’ve changed your thoughts and behaviors, you’re likely 
to start feeling better, even when things are out of place.
Being Driven to Make Things 
“Just So” All the Time
“Just So” OCD frequently begins in childhood. You can see elements of this 
issue in many normal childhood activities. Lots of children arrange their toys 
in special ways, enjoy reading the same book over and over again, and have 

228
Part IV: Targeting Specific Symptoms of OCD 
bedtime rituals. Usually, these patterns, which help provide a needed sense 
of security and comfort, slowly fade over the years. As children grow and 
mature, they recognize that the comfort and security they experienced was 
not created by the patterns, but rather by parents and caregivers. But in 
some children, either because of biology or learning (see Chapters 4 and 5), 
OCD takes over.
For children with “Just So” OCD, the urge to find symmetry, order, and 
feelings of “just so” increases over time instead of fading. Their lives begin 
to fill with distress and rituals designed to make them feel better. This 
pattern can continue for a lifetime.
“Just So” OCD often exists along with other forms of OCD. For example, 
someone may believe that arranging the closet “just so” is necessary to 
please God. This driven, excessive need to please God stems from Shaming 
OCD that focuses on religious issues (see Chapter 14). Another person may 
arrange the closet just so in the belief that it’s necessary in order to keep the 
family safe. In this case, the person has Doubting and Checking OCD along 
with the “just so” type. Finally, people with just the “Just So” OCD may 
arrange their closets because they feel driven to have their clothes “just so.”
Unfortunately, research is currently lacking for the treatment of “Just So” 
OCD. In part, this neglect in literature appears to be due to the fact that many 
of those with this type of OCD don’t seem as interested in changing as those 
afflicted with other OCD types. They view their need for symmetry and order 
as the right way to be. This belief may be held in spite of family and friends 
complaining, teasing, or even getting angry with the “just so” behaviors.
Yet, some folks with this problem do want to do something about their OCD. 
They may want to change because they realize how much time “just so” takes 
or because they are responding to others’ complaints. If the desire to change 
describes you or someone you care about, read on. On the other hand, if you 
have this type of OCD and don’t want to do anything about it, maybe you’ll 
find what comes next in this chapter interesting.
 
Most obsessions and compulsions are not welcome by the person who has 
them. The technical term for this offensiveness is ego-dystonic. On the other 
hand, ego-syntonic refers to the feeling that one’s obsessions and compulsions 
are appropriate and merely reflect one’s values. Symmetry, or “Just So” OCD, 
is often ego-syntonic.
In the rest of this section, we look at the two primary expressions of 
“Just So” OCD:
 
 Arranging: Seeking order
 
 Repeating: Seeking perfection

229
 Chapter 15: Messing with “Just So” OCD
Enforcing order and symmetry on life
If you suffer with the arranging expression of “Just So” OCD, you are focused 
on arranging the environment in certain ways. You want particular things 
around you to be perfectly symmetrical, smooth, clean, or orderly. This need 
for order can take on any number of areas. Here are a few examples:
 
 Books: Some people spend hours each day ordering their books by 
size and shape. Others consume time by precisely measuring the 
distance between the edge of the shelf and each book. Some order 
books alphabetically by author or, oddly enough, the first word that 
appears in the book. Still others dust each book every day or arrange 
them by color. There’s no end to the permutations of these arrange-
ments, but everyone with this concern feels driven to arrange books in 
some special, personally meaningful way.
 
 Carpet fibers and fringe: This concern is surprisingly common. More 
than a few folks straighten the fringe on their rugs many times each day. 
You can imagine how easily a few pieces of fringe can be disturbed by a 
cat, the wind, or people walking around. Others repeatedly vacuum and 
pick at any stray fibers. They want each and every strand of carpet to 
stand up straight and in the same way. Yikes.
Shifting gears and symmetry
The symptoms of OCD are quite varied. Some 
people with OCD have obsessions and compul-
sions about harming others; others collect use-
less junk, while others have obsessions and 
compulsions requiring order and symmetry. 
These different forms of OCD may involve differ-
ent areas of the brain.
A study reported in the 2006 journal 
Neuropsychology looked at the way people 
with and without OCD were able to shift their 
attention from one thing to another. They also 
looked at how types of OCD differently affected 
the performance of tasks that required this abil-
ity. Shifting attention or set shifting involves 
responding to information from the environment 
by changing your focus. Set shifting is involved 
when you learn from your mistakes or solve 
problems through trial and error.
What they found was that people with the need 
for order and symmetry, what we call “Just So” 
OCD, had more trouble than others shifting 
attention. So how might this play out in real life? 
People with trouble shifting attention may have 
difficulty changing from one activity to another, 
multi-tasking, using feedback, or solving prob-
lems. And perhaps some of them have trouble 
shifting away from the need for order, symme-
try, and “just so.”

230
Part IV: Targeting Specific Symptoms of OCD 
 
 Food: People with this focus arrange food in their refrigerators, cup-
boards, and pantries in various and sundry ways. The arrangement may 
be alphabetical or by size, shape, color, nutritional content, or weight. 
Another food-related compulsion is the need to arrange food on the 
plate or table in very specific ways — we aren’t talking about a “nice 
presentation” here, but a precise, rigid pattern based on unusual rules. 
And after sitting down to eat, some people feel driven to eat in a fixed 
pattern — again, based on arbitrary ideas about what constitutes the 
right order.
 
 Money: Of course, many people like to arrange their wallets with the 
ones, fives, tens, and twenties in consecutive order. However, people 
with this OCD concern repeatedly arrange, smooth, and check their 
bills. Sometimes they even iron them each day. Others keep their 
change on their dressers in peculiar, precise, patterns.
 
 Other stuff: As we note earlier, the particular items that must be 
arranged, straightened, ordered, or made “just so” varies greatly. 
Pictures on the wall must be perfectly level and aligned. The hangers in 
the closet must be evenly spaced (see the picture on this book cover). 
Clothes, whether on hangers or in drawers, may have to be arranged in 
special orders by color, function, or texture. Items on a desk may need 
to be arranged in idiosyncratic ways. Shoes must shine without the 
slightest scuff.
Speaking of symmetry, we just bought new blinds that come down from the 
top or up from the bottom. Have you ever tried to make blinds perfectly even 
with each other? Across one room, we have eight blinds to line up. Enough to 
drive you crazy even if you don’t have diagnosed OCD!
 
In order for concerns about symmetry and keeping things “just so” to be 
considered OCD, they must consume a lot of time and interfere with your life 
significantly. Many people have a dollop of fussiness without having OCD.
Trying to get it right by 
repeating and redoing
If you suffer with the repeating expression of “Just So” OCD, you focus on the 
need to repeat and redo actions until they feel just right. There are no objec-
tive criteria for what constitutes “just so” because it’s based on a purely sub-
jective feeling. If you ask people with this type of OCD how they know when 
something is “just so,” they’re likely to answer, “I just know; I can feel it.” 
Sometimes the repeating and redoing goes on for hours. Examples of the 
repeating and redoing expression include:

231
 Chapter 15: Messing with “Just So” OCD
 
 Dressing: This routine involves dressing and arranging one’s clothes 
over and over again, until it all feels and looks just right. Picking just the 
right clothes can be part of this pattern, but the person may not know 
what’s going to feel just right until everything is on.
 
 Evening up: This issue has to do with a need for achieving a feeling of 
evenness. Someone with this concern may feel a need to open doors 
with the left hand as often as the right hand. Some people feel driven to 
chew their food as much on the right side of their mouth as the left side. 
Still others work hard to make sure that their socks come up to exactly 
the same height on each ankle. A few folks try to keep conversations 
evened up by tracking how long each person speaks and trying to 
match them in duration. All of these actions require lots of repeating 
and redoing before that perfect feeling of evenness is achieved. And, of 
course, the feeling doesn’t last.
 
 Reading and writing: Reading redoing entails the need to read, reread, 
and reread until the person feels that the material has been completely 
and fully absorbed and understood. Mind you, the person probably 
understands the material well enough on the first read; it’s just based on 
a “feeling.” Worry about the slightest ambiguity or imperfection in one’s 
written work can cause someone to redo his or her writing many times 
over. It’s a darn good thing we don’t suffer from this problem!
 
 Showering or washing routines: You may think that long cleaning 
rituals sound like contamination OCD (see Chapter 2). But in this case, 
the worry isn’t so much about contamination as it is in getting things to 
feel right. Therefore, the person scrubs and washes different body parts 
in certain sequences and ways until the feeling of “just right” occurs. 
This process can take hours.
The list for repeating and redoing potentially goes on and on and on. We 
could include more items, but this feels just right.
Taking Steps to Change “Just So” OCD
Earlier in this chapter, we note that many people with the “Just So” type 
of OCD waffle on whether or not they want to do something about the 
problem — or whether they view it as a problem at all. If that description fits 
you, we urge you to read Chapter 6 first on the topic of overcoming OCD 
obstacles. That’s where you find ways of exploring and possibly enhancing 
your motivations for change if you indeed want to consider changing. If loved 
ones or others around you are indicating that you may have an issue, then 
working with a therapist to determine your need for change may be helpful.

232
Part IV: Targeting Specific Symptoms of OCD 
Assuming you do find the motivation for change, you should know that there 
are two primary approaches to treating “Just So” OCD:
 
 By addressing ways to change your OCD thinking
 
 By tackling your OCD behavior
We generally recommend employing both strategies for this and other types 
of OCD. Medication is also an option (see Chapter 11), though medications 
may not be quite as effective for this specific type of OCD.
Rearranging your thinking
Chapter 8 reviews many of the ways that the thinking of those with OCD 
becomes distorted. That distorted thinking usually worsens OCD symptoms. 
Interestingly, many of these thought distortions do not seem to play a 
large role in those plagued with the “Just So” type of OCD. Thus, those with 
“Just So” OCD do not tend to exaggerate risk, struggle with uncertainty, feel 
excessive responsibilities, or confuse their thoughts with what’s real.
However, those with “Just So” OCD do have some beliefs that get them in 
trouble and keep them bogged down. These beliefs are about
 
 Self-image
 
 Handling difficult emotions
We discuss each one in the sections that follow.
Rethinking self-image
At some level, most of those with “Just So” OCD feel that the directives from 
their OCD minds are the way things and they should be. You may feel like 
you wouldn’t be you without your OCD. Papers should be orderly, books in 
their place, and everything smooth, perfect, and even. And within limits, a 
little order does feel good.
However, if you think that just maybe your “just so” issues have gone too far, 
try answering the following questions:
 
 Does the time I spend making everything “just so” take away important 
time for other, more meaningful activities?
 
 Would I tell someone I care about that this (ensuring that everything is 
“just so”) is a good way to spend lots of time? Would I tell them that the 
OCD is about who they are as a person?

233
 Chapter 15: Messing with “Just So” OCD
Heather’s example shows how pondering these questions helps motivate her 
to work on this problem because she begins to see her OCD as OCD and not 
as herself.
Heather keeps a clean house. Each day, she cleans every room from top 
to bottom. Each dish, food item, decoration, picture, and book has its 
own place. All the closets in her house are organized by type of clothing 
and hangers are 1/2-inch apart. Heather spends hours keeping her house 
clean; she rarely goes out. Her teenage children are never home because 
they prefer to spend time at homes where the parents are less uptight.
Heather is shocked to learn that her oldest son has been arrested for 
shoplifting. She is required to attend family counseling. Here are the 
answers she comes up with concerning her belief that she just wouldn’t 
be herself without her “Just So” OCD.
 
 Does the time I spend on making everything “just so” take away 
important time for other, more meaningful activities?
 
 I’d estimate that my “Just So” OCD takes me at least a couple hours each 
day. If I spent just a few of those hours each week on quality time with my 
family, everyone would be happier. The feelings are powerful, but so is the 
value in trying to overcome this problem.
 
 Would I tell people I care about that this (ensuring that everything is 
“just so”) is a good way to spend lots of time? Would I tell them that 
the OCD is about who they are as a person?
 
 No way. I’d tell my friends, my husband, or my kids to do anything and 
everything they could to stop spending time this way. I know doing the 
things I do is pointless and silly. I’d tell them that spending time this way 
will detract from their lives, as I can see it has from mine. This OCD stuff 
isn’t about who they are or who I am as a person; it just feels that way 
sometimes to me.
These questions help Heather step back a little from the directives coming 
out of her OCD mind. She can now see that the time she spends on her OCD 
costs her a lot and that she would never recommend that anyone else do 
what she does. She can also see that the OCD is not about who she is as a 
person; it’s just her OCD mind talking when she thinks otherwise. She starts 
making progress with her “just so” behavior.
Rethinking emotional responses
You may believe that you just can’t tolerate having things unfinished, incom-
plete, or out of order. It no doubt does feel like you can’t stand the feelings 
you have when things seem this way. If you have this problem, you likely feel 
unbalanced, tense, anxious, and out of it, along with a sense of urgency to 

234
Part IV: Targeting Specific Symptoms of OCD 
bring your feelings back to “normal.” Once things are back in order, you feel 
significant relief for a while, but the out of sorts feelings soon return. Try 
answering these questions about not being able to stand these feelings.
 
 Have you ever had prolonged pain from an injury, dental work, or 
illness? If so, were you able to stand it, and was it as difficult as your 
OCD urges?
 
 Do you think the urges would continue at the same intense level forever 
if you kept yourself from caving into them?
 
 Were there ever things in the past that you detested doing, yet found 
ways to tolerate? Is it possible that your “Just So” OCD urges would 
be similar?
Jackson’s story involves a slightly different form of “Just So” OCD, and he 
uses these questions to help him see that he probably can stand having some 
uncomfortable feelings for a while.
Jackson has “Just So” OCD and focuses on a variety of ordering issues 
as well as redoing concerns. He has very specific ways that everything 
on his nightstand must be lined up or he feels he cannot go to sleep. 
He also reads notes about his job assignment for the next day each night. 
However, he feels he must read and reread until he has completely 
understood each and every part of the assignment. He knows this reading 
should require about five or ten minutes, but he usually can’t stop until 
he’s read the material at least ten times — a process that takes him an 
hour and a half most nights. He believes that stopping his driven OCD 
behaviors would drive him crazy and that he simply couldn’t stand going 
through each day any other way.
 
 Have you ever had prolonged pain from an injury, dental work, or 
illness? If so, were you able to stand it, and was it as difficult as your 
OCD urges?
 
 I remember playing on my college football team. I got injured often, but 
once I broke my ankle in two places. It hurt for weeks while I hobbled 
around. I’d have to say that the pain from that injury actually felt worse 
than the feelings of incompleteness I have when I resist my OCD for 
a while.
 
 Do you think the urges would continue at the same intense level 
forever if you kept yourself from caving into them?
 
 It does sort of feel like they would continue forever. But now that I think 
about it, I can recall a few times when I resisted the urges for a few hours 
and the feelings actually started to come down a little. Maybe if I continued 
that work, the feelings would come down even more.

235
 Chapter 15: Messing with “Just So” OCD
 
 Were there ever things in the past that you detested doing, yet found 
ways to tolerate? Is it possible that your “Just So” OCD urges would 
be similar?
 
 I remember that for years I absolutely hated paying bills and balancing my 
checkbook. I almost couldn’t get myself to do it at all. It’s funny, but now I 
don’t mind those tasks. Sometimes I even look at balancing the checkbook 
as a challenge when it seems a little off at first. I get the point; maybe if I 
work really hard at it, my “Just So” OCD could be a little like my hating to 
pay bills and balance my checkbook. Over time, it just might get better.
Jackson’s work on these questions helps him to see that feelings can change 
over time. And he now realizes that he can stand all sorts of uncomfortable 
feelings for a while. He feels more confident that if he tolerates the discom-
fort, his urges will slowly but surely fade. He happens to be right.
Redoing your responses to repeating
Exposure and response prevention (ERP), described in Chapter 10, is widely 
considered the most effective treatment for OCD. Refer to that chapter for 
detailed instructions on carrying out ERP. Here we give you some sample 
exposure staircases for “Just So” OCD.
 
The example ERP staircases and hierarchies are just that — examples. The 
actual content for your particular staircases will vary considerably. However, 
these staircases can give you ideas for how to construct your own.
 
Many people with “Just So” OCD may need some extra support in their 
attempts at ERP. We suggest getting help from a mental-health professional 
trained in ERP.
In the sections that follow, we give you examples of ways to use ERP to 
address the two primary expressions of “Just So” OCD: arranging and 
repeating.
Applying ERP to ordering and symmetry
Sometimes, being organized and having a place for everything is pretty nice. 
But when this type of OCD gets out of hand, life can become pretty miserable 
for the person with this arranging expression and any family members 
who are involved. Figure 15-1 presents an example of an ERP staircase for 
someone with order and symmetry concerns. In simple terms, you start on 
the bottom stair and move up as each “step” is successfully overcome.

Applying ERP to repeating and redoing
Repeating and redoing can become time consuming and interfere greatly 
with functioning. This can be especially problematic if you are required to 
read or produce written products at school or work. Having to do things over 
and over again slows you down. Here is a sample exposure hierarchy for this 
type of concern. (Hierarchies are the same as staircases; the only difference 
is that a hierarchy is a list, whereas a staircase is the list represented in a 
graphic.)

M
ost people have some sort of collection in their homes, whether it is 
coins, stamps, or souvenirs. But those with Hoarding OCD acquire, 
accumulate, and purchase in staggering proportions — while rarely throwing 
anything out. Their homes eventually bulge at the seams.
In this chapter, we describe the mysterious nature of Hoarding OCD. A 
surprising number of people with this problem are found dead, seriously ill, 
or injured — victims of the consequences of their hoarding, which include 
the creation of unsafe or unsanitary conditions. Hoarders typically hide their 
problem from others and, rather than seek treatment, they are discovered 
by family members, police, social workers, and landlords. In fact, if hoarders 
do seek treatment, they usually wait until about the age of 50.
Hoarding seemed almost untreatable at one time, but that has changed. 
Today, hoarding presents a more hopeful picture, which we share in 
this chapter.
Defining Hoarding OCD
Professionals are increasingly considering Hoarding OCD to be a unique type 
of OCD. In fact, someday hoarding may have its own special category in the 
manual that professionals consult for determining official diagnoses of those 
who have various types of emotional disorders.

238
Part IV: Targeting Specific Symptoms of OCD 
Hoarding OCD differs from other types of OCD in that sufferers frequently 
have low motivation for change. They also seem to think differently than 
those with other types of OCD (see the section “Uncovering problems in 
thinking,” later in this chapter). But for the time being, hoarding is most 
frequently considered a type of OCD. Besides that, it’s really interesting, so 
we’d hate not to include it in this book!
 
Like other types of OCD, Hoarding OCD has an inheritable component. But 
whereas non-hoarding OCD, like brown eyes, is a dominant trait, Hoarding 
OCD, like blue eyes, appears to involve a recessive gene. Hoarding also 
involves slightly different areas of the brain than other types of OCD (see 
Chapter 4). Thus, hoarding may be a biologically distinct type of OCD.
Describing characteristics of hoarding
So just exactly what is Hoarding OCD? Drs. Gail Steketee and Randy Frost 
have studied this problem for years and suggest that it has three defining 
characteristics:
 
 People accumulate huge quantities of possessions that have trivial 
value. At the same time, they may mix items into their piles of junk that 
do have value — jewelry, legal papers, and so forth. But it is the piles of 
items without real value that define this characteristic.
 
 Homes become so cluttered that the living areas can no longer be used 
for their original purposes (such as dining, watching television, bathing, 
or cooking).
 
 Those who acquire these possessions either feel very distressed by the 
effects of their hoarding or they show signs of impaired ability to work 
or carry out their lives in a normal manner.
Note that the third characteristic involves either distress or impairment — 
thus, one can have Hoarding OCD without actually feeling distressed about 
it. And not feeling concerned about the problem is quite common. The lack 
of distress is surprising, though, because Hoarding OCD causes substantial 
disability.
Hoarders usually begin acquiring things in adolescence. The accumulation of 
junk gradually increases over time. Mind you, lots of people collect things — 
sometimes far more than they need. But we’re not talking about coin and 
stamp collections here. And we’re not talking about an overstuffed garage, 
stacks of paper on your desk, or overflowing closets. If that were the case, far 
too many people would qualify as hoarders.

239
 Chapter 16: Throwing Out OCD: Hoarding
We’re talking about useless junk piled in mounds so high that space is no 
longer useable or livable. See Figure 16-1 for a picture of a typical hoarder’s 
living area. And that picture is not as bad as it gets. To understand how bad 
conditions can become, read on.
Seeing the consequences of hoarding
The consequences of having Hoarding OCD can be quite harsh and severe. 
As noted earlier in this chapter, some hoarders are found dead or injured 
as a result of malnutrition or poor home safety conditions. The clutter and 
resulting unsanitary conditions can result in high risk for:
 
 Chronic breathing problems
 
 Fire
 
 Gas or water leaks
 
 Insect and rodent infestations
 
 Tripping and falling
The tragic hoarding of the Collyer brothers
One of the strangest and saddest stories of 
hoarding involves the reclusive brothers 
Langley and Homer Collyer. Their story was 
covered by newspapers throughout the world. 
Sons of a doctor and an opera singer, the 
Collyer brothers inherited a 12-room townhouse 
in New York City. They had both graduated from 
Columbia University. While Homer worked for a 
time as a lawyer, Langley became increasingly 
reclusive. At some point, Homer became blind, 
apparently from various health issues. He was 
unable to work, and was totally dependent on 
Langley for his care. They filled their home with 
newspapers, magazines, broken furniture, thou-
sands of books, 14 pianos, and junk. They kept 
their doors locked. Eventually utilities were 
turned off because of unpaid bills.
The brothers became increasingly paranoid 
and set booby traps so that anyone breaking in 
would be crushed by the rubble. Someone 
called the police in 1947 because of a horrible 
smell. A single officer was unable to get in — 
he faced a solid wall of broken furniture and 
newspapers. It took a squad of seven men to 
finally get through and then discover Homer 
dead from cardiac arrest, likely caused by mal-
nutrition and dehydration. It took several weeks 
to find Langley. Police speculated that he’d 
been attempting to deliver food and water to his 
invalid brother when he was crushed by one of 
his own booby traps. More than 100 tons of 
hoarded stuff were cleared from the four-story 
building, which had to be demolished.

Hoarders eventually stop inviting people to their homes. The stove may 
stop working, but they fear calling an appliance repairman because someone 
entering their house might alert health or welfare officials. Even a pizza 
delivery could result in a report to the police.
Sometimes homes suffer structural damage because of leaky water faucets. 
Insects or rodents feed on rotting food. Feces or urine often accumulate from 
rodents, large numbers of animals, or the unusual act of hoarding one’s own 
excrement. If someone turns a hoarder in, officials may hospitalize or evict 
him. Cleanup when hoarders are discovered can be extremely costly — and 
is usually covered by tax dollars.
Perhaps not surprisingly, hoarders tend to be single. They develop an 
attachment to “stuff” rather than people. Those who do marry have a high 
divorce rate.
Those afflicted with Hoarding OCD often show profound signs of various 
other disabilities. They have an increased occurrence of depression, anxiety, 
and most other emotional problems. They miss more work than most people, 
and they often have many other health problems.
 
If you or someone you care about has Hoarding OCD, there’s a good chance 
that another emotional problem such as depression or anxiety is also present. 
If you think that may be the case for you, please consult a mental-health 
professional. We also recommend reading two other books authored by us 
and published by Wiley: Overcoming Anxiety For Dummies and Depression 
For Dummies.

241
 Chapter 16: Throwing Out OCD: Hoarding
Uncovering problems in thinking
Hoarders show some unusual types of thinking and a heightened, intense 
attachment to objects and possessions. Other types of OCD thinking tend 
to focus on doubts and uncertainty (see Chapter 5). The minds of hoarders 
are relatively less dominated by doubts and uncertainty. They work hard 
to maintain control over their collections and feel quite upset if anyone 
threatens to clean things up or throw anything away.
The kinds of things hoarders collect usually appear extremely illogical to 
others. But hoarders feel strongly that their collections are necessary, 
reasonable, and important. For example, a female hoarder may save an 
8-year-old Christmas catalog from a department store because she likes one 
of the dresses, but wants to wait until she loses 50 pounds before she buys 
it. If someone points out that the store probably doesn’t carry that dress any 
longer, she replies that they’re likely to carry other items she’d like since 
they had that dress before. And she doesn’t want to forget about the store. 
Never mind that that Christmas catalog probably lies under 4 feet of other 
papers, mail, bills, and miscellaneous junk.
Piling up pets
Animal hoarding is a strange but relatively 
common type of Hoarding OCD. Over a thou-
sand new cases are discovered each year. Yet, 
most animal hoarders go undetected, so we 
really don’t know how many exist. Animal 
hoarders accumulate large numbers of animals, 
fail to provide adequate care, seem unaware of 
the poor health of their animals, and are oblivi-
ous to the horrible state of their environment. 
Many animal hoarders keep dead animals in 
their homes, don’t attempt to clean up their 
waste, and avoid contact with other people. 
Animal hoarders usually live alone, lack basic 
sanitation, and are very resistant to treatment. 
After being caught, most animal hoarders 
immediately return to collecting. Here are four 
examples:
  A New Jersey couple living in a multimillion-
dollar, 12,000-square-foot house was 
charged with hundreds of counts of animal 
cruelty. A delivery man contacted police 
after smelling an intense odor through an 
open window. The home was filled with 
boxes and bags of dead cats. Sixty-two sick 
cats were confiscated as well as six dogs. 
More cats were living between the walls of 
the home.
  A New Mexico woman was found dead of 
natural causes in her home. Some of the 33 
cats and 4 dogs were feeding off of her 
body. There was at least a foot of filth and 
feces in every room.
  In Tucson, Arizona, authorities discovered 
800 dogs (the majority Chihuahuas) in a triple-
wide mobile home. In addition, 80 parrots 
inhabited the premises. Not surprisingly, the 
animals were in poor health.
  A psychiatrist was arrested when police 
discovered that not only was she hoarding 
cats and dogs at her home, but she rented 
a hotel room for 21 cats. Tragically, most of 
the animals found in these environments 
are euthanized.

242
Part IV: Targeting Specific Symptoms of OCD 
Hoarders usually demonstrate deficits in the way their brains think and pro-
cess information. Several of these cognitive problems have been identified 
through psychological testing and research. They include:
 
 Attention: Hoarders tend to be distracted easily by inconsequential 
sights, sounds, and events. For example, they’ll zero in on the color or 
shininess of a piece of paper and save it because of how it looks rather 
than what it contains. They struggle to focus on what’s truly important.
 
 Categorizing: Those with Hoarding OCD have profound trouble figuring 
out how to file things in a logical manner. They struggle to determine 
reasonable categories. Organizational strategies as simple as creating 
piles for unpaid bills versus paid bills or important legal papers versus 
interesting newspaper articles are not easy concepts for them to grasp.
 
 Decision-making: Hoarders have great trouble making even trivial 
decisions. They may ponder whether to drink out of the red glass or 
the blue glass. They can’t decide what to eat. And they certainly can’t 
decide what’s truly important to keep or throw away.
 
 Memory: Hoarders can remember things, but they lack confidence in 
their memories. They tend to rely on the visual mode of remembering. 
For example, a man may be able to tell you that a given paper lies about 
“two feet down in a pile next to his sofa.” He feels that he needs visual 
cues in order to remember. Putting things out of sight in a filing cabinet 
would feel like putting them out of mind.
Assembling uncommon collections
Hoarders hoard lots of different things. Their collections have personal 
meaning to them as individuals. Some hoarders save objects that may have 
small, possible — but dubious — future utility. Others report wanting to save 
things because they have sentimental value. They fear losing the slightest bit 
of conceivably useful information. In addition, they can’t stand the idea of 
wasting anything, so they hold onto everything. Other objects are saved 
because they look interesting, beautiful, or unusual. Hoarders buy, find, or 
steal their collectibles in dumpsters, the mail, on the Internet, stores, or on 
the street — pretty much anywhere. Each hoarder’s collection is unique, but 
some of the most common collections include:
 
 Books and articles
 
 Bottles, cans, bottle caps
 
 Cats, dogs, or other animals
 
 Cleaning supplies

243
 Chapter 16: Throwing Out OCD: Hoarding
 
 Clothes, shoes, jewelry
 
 Coins, money (not rare collectibles)
 
 Food items
 
 Mail — junk, bills, or catalogs
 
 Matches, lint, aluminum foil, gum wrappers
 
 Newspapers, magazines, or comic books
 
 Paper bags, plastic bags, or cardboard boxes
 
 Photographs, mementos, souvenirs
 
 Screws, nails, tacks, hooks
 
 Staples, paper clips, rubber bands, pens, pencils
 
 Tissue paper, wrapping paper, greeting cards
 
 Tools, batteries, parts of appliances and cars
 
 Toys
 
 Urine, feces, saliva, blood
 
 Yarn, string, cloth
Hoarders find comfort in these virtually useless collections. They even derive 
their identity from their collections. But at the same time, they realize that 
their possessions may be excessive and are embarrassed when others 
discover their piles of stuff.
 
People who collect items of significance in terms of either monetary or senti-
mental value, such as rare coins, license plates, wine bottle corks, rare or 
interesting stamps, matchbook covers, and so on, are not necessarily suffering 
from Hoarding OCD — even when their family members see their collections 
as silly or annoying. True collectors do not allow their collections to overtake 
their lives. They tend to maintain their collections in well-organized contain-
ers. They enjoy talking about and showing off their collections with other 
like-minded folks. They’re not embarrassed about their collections, but feel 
pride instead. Although their collections may take up some space, they do not 
overflow halls, block doorways, or envelop appliances.
Treating Hoarding OCD
Until recently, treatments for Hoarding OCD had a dismal track record. 
Psychotherapies such as exposure and response prevention (ERP) did not 
seem to be as effective for this type of OCD as they had been for other 

244
Part IV: Targeting Specific Symptoms of OCD 
types of OCD. And medications, at best, have demonstrated a minimal impact 
on the problem (see Chapter 11 for more information about medications 
and OCD).
Fortunately, the picture is improving. It now appears that treatments 
encompassing strategies for improving both thinking and behavior as they 
relate to Hoarding OCD appear to work pretty well, although they require 
more time (often close to a year of fairly intense work) than treatments for 
other types of OCD. So you may need to be a little patient, but if you have 
Hoarding OCD, you can probably improve your living situation significantly.
 
If you have severe Hoarding OCD and have lost major portions of your living 
space to your various collections, you should seek professional help. We 
also strongly recommend that you check out the Compulsive Hoarding and 
Acquiring Workbook by Drs. Gail Steketee and Randy Frost (Oxford University 
Press) to use in collaboration with your therapist. The book presents a 
comprehensive treatment approach for Hoarding OCD.
 
The information in this chapter may prove helpful to you if you suffer from 
mild to modest hoarding problems, and may even help you get started if you 
have more serious difficulty. Interested family and friends may also find this 
material informative. Additionally, millions of people suffer not from true 
Hoarding OCD (see “Defining Hoarding OCD,” earlier in this chapter), but from 
definite issues with over-accumulation of junk. Thus, even we have learned 
how to toss out many unworn clothes from our closets by using some of the 
rules discussed in this section.
Tackling your OCD behavior involves four areas, which we discuss in the fol-
lowing sections:
 
 Weighing costs and benefits
 
 Challenging hoarding beliefs
 
 Recognizing what is essential
 
 Learning how to organize
 
If you are a friend or family member of someone with Hoarding OCD, please 
realize that pressure typically only makes things worse. You can suggest 
that someone with this problem consider conducting a cost/benefit analysis 
similar to what follows, but aggressive confrontation is not advisable.
Tallying up the costs and benefits
If you have Hoarding OCD, you usually have trouble with many decisions, 
and the decision to seek treatment is an especially difficult one. Ambivalence 
concerning change is quite common. You may be able to resolve that 
ambivalence with a cost/benefit analysis.

245
 Chapter 16: Throwing Out OCD: Hoarding
A cost/benefit analysis is pretty much what it sounds like. First you review all 
the possible benefits that your hoarding entails — every way in which you 
believe that hoarding improves your life or feelings in some manner. Then 
you list every imaginable cost — all the ways in which you believe that 
hoarding may negatively impact your life and emotions. Finally, you reflect 
on these two lists and ask yourself which one feels most persuasive to you. 
The following steps explain how to proceed. See Appendix A for a blank form 
you can use to conduct your own cost/benefit analysis.
 
1. On a piece of paper or in a notebook, designate space for the creation 
of two columns plus a block of space after the columns for writing a 
summary.
 
 Label the first column “Benefits.” Label the second column “Costs.” 
Label the block of space “My Reflections.”
 
2. Under “Benefits,” write down all the imaginable advantages of 
hoarding and the ways in which it feels useful to you.
 
 Include how it makes things easier or better and/or how it may help you 
feel better, safer, or more secure.
 
3. Under “Costs,” write down all the ways that your hoarding may hold 
you back, cost you something, or cause you harm.
 
 Don’t forget to include how hoarding may cause negative emotions, such 
as shame or embarrassment.
 
4. Under “My Reflections,” summarize what you can deduce from your 
cost/benefit analysis.
 
 Which argument seems more formidable — the costs or the benefits of 
your hoarding?
Matt’s example in the following story demonstrates how someone with 
Hoarding OCD feels horribly ambivalent about whether or not he wants to 
seek treatment. A cost/benefit analysis helps him find the answer.
Matt hoards lots of things — tools, car parts, batteries, nails, screws, 
paper clips, rubber bands, scrap metal, wood of almost any type, 
old shingles, broken glass, string, wire, and scraps of plastic. He is a 
handyman and never wants to find himself without exactly the right item 
for any project he undertakes. His collections overflow his entire garage 
and recently have overtaken his living room and kitchen from floor to 
ceiling. He also feels attached to all of these “treasures.” He picks up a 
copy of OCD For Dummies and decides to fill out a cost/benefit analysis 
for his hoarding, as shown in Table 16-1.

246

I never find myself without the 
right tool or part.
I can’t always find what I need in all of 
these piles.
I’m not embarrassed by not having 
what I need.
I am deeply embarrassed to have anyone 
see my home.
I never run out of things.
I can barely get through my house lately.
I save time by not having to run 
to the store for every little thing I 
need.
I spend huge amounts of time going through 
all my stuff in order to remember what I 
have and where it is.
Throwing things away makes me 
feel nervous. 
I’m starting to fear that if someone sees my 
house, they might call me in to the health 
department.
Having all this stuff makes me feel 
more like a true handyman. 
I can’t have friends over because they’d 
think that I’m crazy.
I could never date anyone seriously 
because of how my house looks.
Some of the piles are so tall that I’m afraid 
they could fall and hurt my cat.
My Reflections
Wow. This is difficult. I don’t want to start throwing things away. But I can see from 
this exercise that my hoarding is really starting to cost me a lot. It’s getting out of 
hand. I’d feel horrible if my cat got hurt by a pile of junk falling on her. And if I ever 
do run out of something, it wouldn’t be horrible to go and buy it. Also, I miss having 
people over. I want to feel like a normal person again.
As a result of weighing the costs against the benefits, Matt chooses to go 
ahead and seek treatment. Besides, he knows he can always stop the 
treatment if he just can’t stand it. He believes that treatment looks worth 
undertaking. Now he’s ready for the next step in dealing with his Hoarding 
OCD — challenging his beliefs about hoarding.
Questioning beliefs about hoarding
If you have Hoarding OCD, you probably carry around some interesting 
beliefs in your mind that give you reasons for continuing your hoarding. 
Following, we list a few of the most important of these beliefs. Then we give 
you a list of questions that you can use to challenge them. With practice, 
you’re likely to find that these beliefs start losing their ability to control your 

247
 Chapter 16: Throwing Out OCD: Hoarding
hoarding behavior. Two additional beliefs frequently associated with 
hoarding (perfectionism and being excessively responsible) can be found 
in Chapter 8.
 
 Hoarding gives me comfort. This concern focuses on the discomfort 
hoarders usually feel when they throw possessions out. They feel they 
cannot stand to let go of their stuff.
 
 I need to see things in order to remember them. This belief comes 
about because many of those with Hoarding OCD don’t trust their 
memories. They believe that they must keep things in sight or they will 
forget them.
 
 My collections define who I am. Those with this hoarding belief think 
that their possessions define who they are. They worry that tossing 
things out will cause them to lose part of their identity.
 
 My possessions have real value. This compulsive credo tells the 
person that all possessions have value even if that value is small. If 
you have fallen prey to this idea, you’re probably capable of assigning 
value to almost anything. Thus, losing something feels like it could be 
calamitous.
We recommend that you review these beliefs and figure out which ones 
(if any) apply to you. If one or more do (and they likely will!), then subject 
your beliefs to further scrutiny by asking yourself the following questions:
 
 Can I think of any evidence or past experiences that might contradict 
this belief?
 
 Can I think of anything illogical about this belief and consider a more 
logical alternative? Would other people see this belief as illogical?
 
 Would I be willing to consider testing this belief out by throwing things 
away (see the later section “Developing New Strategies for Keeping and 
Tossing Things”) and seeing whether my fears actually come true?
Teresa suffers from the common hoarding belief that her possessions have 
real value. The following example shows you how she uses the preceding 
questions to evaluate her belief.
Teresa has hoarded magazines, newspapers, books, flyers, and ads for 
years. She also accumulates cleaning supplies at an astounding rate. Her 
apartment is filled to the bursting point. She goes to a therapist after she 
discovers herself unable to use her dining room to eat or her kitchen to 
cook. Her therapist asks her to confront her belief about the value of her 
possessions. Here are her responses:

248
Part IV: Targeting Specific Symptoms of OCD 
 
 Can you think of any evidence or past experiences that might 
contradict this belief?
 
 Well, I have to admit that I haven’t used very many of the things I have 
accumulated. I’d guess that about 98 percent of the items in my piles never 
actually get used, so their real value must be a little questionable.
 
 Can you think of anything illogical about this belief and consider 
a more logical alternative? Would other people see this belief as 
illogical?
 
 I know that other people see my belief as illogical. I guess I do know in my 
head that no one would buy these papers, so they must be less valuable 
than I feel they are.
 
 Would you be willing to consider testing this belief out by throwing 
things away and seeing whether your fears actually come true?
 
 It’s gotten to the point where I think I have to try. I fear losing these things 
and the effects of tossing them out. But I guess I don’t actually know that 
any disasters will occur by eliminating these things. So, yes, it’s time to take 
a run at this thing and confront my beliefs head on.
Tackling thoughts that fuel accumulating
Many folks with Hoarding OCD acquire their piles by buying or searching for 
huge quantities of stuff. If you tend to pursue the procurement of possessions 
endlessly, the problem may be related to difficulty in distinguishing between 
needs and wants. We suggest that you ask yourself these questions prior to 
making almost any purchase:
 
 Do I actually have the time to deal with this purchase (in relation to 
books, magazines, camera equipment, and anything else that requires 
time, study, or involvement)?
 
 Do most people have this item and consider it essential?
 
 Will I feel substantially happier three months from now if I obtain 
this item?
 
 Will this item enhance the quality of my life significantly?
 
 Would not having this thing put my safety, health, or well-being 
in danger?
We suspect that answering these questions will help you see that many 
of the things you find yourself desiring or wanting are actually of limited 
importance to your life. And because almost everything consumes space, 
resources, and/or time, perhaps you’re better off without many of these 
things. Distinguishing between wants and needs helps prepare you for the 
later section, “Developing New Strategies for Keeping and Tossing Things.”

249
 Chapter 16: Throwing Out OCD: Hoarding
Learning to organize
This final hoarding rethinking strategy also helps you prepare for tackling 
your hoarding behavior. Because those with Hoarding OCD frequently strug-
gle with organization, we recommend that you compile a list of categories for 
your possessions. Then go through each category and make a decision about 
where you want to keep items in that category. For example, keeping canned 
foods in your kitchen pantry makes sense.
We recommend that you make a list of 20 or 30 categories for your stuff. 
Table 16-2 provides some ideas for these categories, but you’re free to come 
up with your own list as long as it makes sense.

Developing New Strategies for 
Keeping and Tossing Things
Behavioral techniques for Hoarding OCD start with setting specific goals and 
then slowly moving forward, one at a time. One reason that hoarders often 
resist treatment is because they worry that someone’s going to come by 

250
Part IV: Targeting Specific Symptoms of OCD 
with a dumpster during the first session. But the idea behind exposure and 
response prevention (ERP), the most commonly used treatment, is to start 
with tasks that are not unbearable and build up tolerance. In this section, we 
give you some ideas on how to do that.
 
Before you attempt ERP, refer to the complete, step-by-step directions we 
provide in Chapter 10.
Resisting accumulating
Figure 16-2 illustrates an exposure staircase that involves resisting accumu-
lating. If a hoarder keeps getting more stuff, the problem becomes pretty 
daunting to solve in a hurry. Some people with Hoarding OCD accumulate 
by not throwing out junk mail, newspapers, or trash. Others accumulate 
largely through buying things compulsively. The staircase in Figure 16-2 deals 
with the latter. See Figure 16-3 in the section “Doing a real cleanup” for an 
illustration of an exposure staircase that deals with tossing things out. Your 
staircases will contain different items and ratings — ours are intended to give 
you an idea of how to proceed.
 
If you have trouble going into stores, flea markets, or surfing the Internet 
without buying something, ask yourself the following questions: “Do I really 
need this?” “Do I already have this?” “Will I use this?” “Would I get sick or 
die without this?” “Am I buying this just to make myself feel better?”

Imagining tossing stuff out
Some exposure hierarchies can be done in the imagination. Starting with an 
imaginary hierarchy can help warm you up for a real life exposure hierarchy, 
which you’ll need to do next. For most people, a therapist or a trained coach 
needs to be present to assist in the exercise. The assisting person can ask 

251

questions, add details, and keep track of the time and the Ugh Factor Ratings. 
The following example gives you an idea of some possible steps for this type 
of exposure hierarchy.

Doing a real cleanup
The biggest challenge is actually sorting, giving away, and discarding things. 
Just imagining the job often causes anxiety. The task of cleaning a house 
stuffed with stuff can be overwhelming. Therefore, breaking the tasks into 
small steps and tackling the easier areas first are very important.
 
Before you start your own cleanup, decide what you’ll do with your items — 
list which items you’ll throw away, give to charity, sell, recycle, give to a 
friend, and put in storage. You must make a decision. Not making a decision is 
making a decision to keep hoarding.
The exposure staircase in Figure 16-3 can provide you with some ideas on 
how to approach the process of cleaning up, but the staircase you create 
should be consistent with your own hoarding habits.

252
Part IV: Targeting Specific Symptoms of OCD 
When you begin working on your exposure staircase, don’t try to do too 
much in one day. Regularly working for short periods of time is better than 
working until exhaustion. Plan to work about an hour or two on sorting, 
throwing away, and storing items. Then take the rest of the day off to do 
something pleasant (not getting more things). Keep at this until you can 
reclaim your life.
 
Consider writing out some reminders on index cards to carry with you when 
you are sorting, discarding, or storing, for example, “I must donate, throw 
away, or store,” “I have never used this,” “People are more important than 
things,” and “I will benefit from living a simpler life.” Let these messages 
become mantras.
What papers to keep
Regardless of whether you have a problem with 
hoarding, there are lots of papers that have to 
be kept and filed in a lifetime. The IRS says that 
if you don’t file a tax return or you file a fraudu-
lent tax return, there’s no limit to how long they 
can come after you. So keep those records of 
your fraudulent activity forever. Hmmm, hope-
fully that situation doesn’t apply to you. But the 
IRS says that if you filed a return but forgot to 
report a quarter of your income or if you claimed 
a loss from a worthless security (but it wasn’t 
clearly fraudulent), they have seven years to 
challenge you. So keeping your tax-related 
records for seven years is probably a good idea. 
For most people, the IRS says that tax records 
need to be kept for three years. That’s how long 
the IRS has to come after you for typical audits 
or challenges. But if you like to play it safe and 
you aren’t a crook, we suggest maintaining tax 
records for seven years.
Keep certificates and papers related to birth, 
marriage, divorce (and settlement agreements), 
adoptions, custody, citizenship, military service, 
wills, advance directives, current passports, 
social security, employment records, and death 
in safe places permanently. House- and car-
related documents (such as ownership papers, 
deeds, and contracts) should be kept while you 
own the property and until the tax conse-
quences have been addressed. For example, if 
you sell a home and claim a tax deduction, you 
need to keep the papers three years past the 
time you file your tax return (unless you do 
something fraudulent — then keep the papers 
forever, but again, we don’t really recommend 
fraud).
Stocks, bonds, bank accounts, certificates of 
deposit, insurance policies, and securities 
should be kept during your ownership or for up 
to seven years for tax purposes. Cancelled 
checks that have no relation to taxes can be 
tossed after three years. Pay stubs can be 
thrown out at the end of each year after you’ve 
compared them to your W-2. Throw out credit 
card slips and sales receipts after 30 days 
unless there are applicable warranties or tax 
implications.
Other paper (or video) documentation that 
should be stored in a safe place includes a list 
of all the valuables in your home, such as jew-
elry, appliances, art, and so on. You should also 
develop a list of contacts (family, attorney, phy-
sician) that you can leave with a trusted friend 
should anything happen to you.

G
od bless you! Gesundheit (which is German for “good health”)! These 
phrases are examples of the custom of giving a blessing to others 
after they sneeze. Most people say something when in the company of a 
sneezer, even if they aren’t sure why. Such responses to sneezing, like many 
superstitions, probably have some origins that make a little sense.
The expression “God bless you” may have begun during the bubonic plague 
in Europe. Sneezing could be the first sign of an illness that often led to 
death. The blessing was an attempt to stop the disease or provide some 
spiritual comfort if, in fact, the sneezer was infected. Other beliefs about 
sneezing include that when someone sneezes, the soul tries to escape, the 
heart stops, or the devil tries to inhabit the body. What we really know is 
that sneezing causes zillions of germs to spew out of your nose at about 100 
miles an hour!
In this chapter, we discuss Superstitious OCD. Lots of people have supersti-
tions. We tell you the difference between “normal” beliefs, superstitions, and 
OCD superstitions. We discuss the most common superstitions associated 
with Superstitious OCD, and we give you techniques for challenging 
Superstitious OCD thinking and behavior.
Seeing When Superstitions 
Constitute OCD
A popular old song asks the question, “Do you believe in magic?” You 
probably base most of your beliefs on what you observe, what you can 
prove, and what you have been taught. So you observe that the sky is 

256
Part IV: Targeting Specific Symptoms of OCD 
blue, you can prove that apples fall to the ground, and you have been taught 
that Abraham Lincoln was the president of the United States during the 
Civil War.
You’ve probably heard that some people consider the number 13 to be 
associated with bad luck. Do you believe that? If you do, then what do you 
base your belief on? If you think about it, you can’t observe, prove, or base 
a belief that the number 13 is connected to bad luck on any real or factual 
evidence. When a belief is disconnected from any proof or facts, it is very 
likely a superstition.
Maybe the number 13 makes you a bit uncomfortable, but you really don’t 
live most of your life thinking about the number 13. If that’s the case, your 
superstition about the number doesn’t interfere with your life. Thus, you 
have a superstition, but it’s not Superstitious OCD.
If you have Superstitious OCD and view 13 as something to be avoided, 
you may refuse to go outside on the 13th day of each month. You may feel 
compelled to avoid looking at the number 13 or refuse to exit the elevator 
onto the 13th floor. You may find yourself avoiding groups of 13 people at 
meetings or restaurants. You strongly believe that the number 13 must be 
avoided or it will in some way hurt you or people you care about. You may 
struggle to get through this paragraph because of all the number 13s that 
appear in it. We thought about making this Chapter 13, but decided not to 
take the risk!
The difference between general superstition and Superstitious OCD is 
that OCD consumes your mind and steals significant time from enjoying 
your life. Think of a continuum of belief. At one end is not taking something 
too seriously (like bad luck associated with the number 13); at the other 
end is believing in something wholeheartedly despite a lack of evidence 
or experience — and then taking time-consuming actions to avoid the 
superstition.
 
Those with Superstitious OCD have unwanted obsessions — thoughts, images, 
or urges — about their superstition. They also have compulsions — mental 
rituals or patterns of actions — that they perform in order to neutralize or 
decrease the discomfort of the obsession.
 
Various types of OCD overlap with each other. Seeing elements of 
Superstitious OCD associated with other types of OCD is particularly common. 
However, we present Superstitious OCD separately because some people 
suffer primarily from this type of OCD and show few or no signs of other types 
of OCD.

 Chapter 17: Shrinking Superstitious OCD
Revealing Common OCD 
Superstitions and Rituals
Like most expressions of OCD, those involving superstitions are infinite 
and mostly unique. Obsessions and compulsions often start with common 
superstitions, such as thinking that 13 is unlucky, but become odder and 
increasingly complex. A few superstition themes are particularly common. 
Here are some examples, along with a few of the ways that people try to 
neutralize them through various compulsive rituals:
 
 Cats: Cats are a common worry among those with Superstitious OCD. 
Black cats, of course, stand out and are seen as inflicting bad luck or 
harm when they cross one’s path. Some also believe that cats can suck 
the breath out of babies if left unattended for even a moment around 
an infant. Those with Superstitious OCD sometimes feel inclined to 
“undo” the effects of cat encounters by carrying lucky symbols, turning 
in circles seven times, or saying “tac” seven times in their minds in 
order to cancel out the cat because tac is cat spelled backwards.
 
 Cemeteries and death: Cemeteries, words related to death, and symbols 
of death often create consternation for many of those with Superstitious 
OCD. These folks typically avoid driving by funeral homes and cemeter-
ies. They try to avoid passing by a hearse or even letting their eyes 
pass over the obituary section in a newspaper. When they do have the 
misfortune of confronting one or more of these death-related objects or 
symbols, they feel driven to neutralize the event. Some may need to 
chant the word “life” over and over again. Others may need to plant nine 
new flowers in their gardens — you can imagine how full those gardens 
become.
 
 Colors: For many, black means death and evil. Red represents blood and 
injury or ill health. If these colors are thought about or encountered, the 
person may feel a need to neutralize them by performing any number 
of rituals, such as tapping a foot, praying, imagining another color, or 
spelling the color backwards.
 
 Numbers: Those with Superstitious OCD commonly believe in lucky 
numbers and unlucky numbers. Numbers can have any kind of signifi-
cance. For example, a man may read license plate numbers and have 
to stop his car whenever he encounters a plate with the number three 
in it. A woman may fear the number four and worry that thinking about 
the number or encountering it in her daily life will cause harm to herself 
or her family unless she finds a way to neutralize the number. When she 
sees or thinks about four, she must walk in counterclockwise circles 
eight times to neutralize the number’s effects.

258
Part IV: Targeting Specific Symptoms of OCD 
 
 Symbols: Some carry around grave concerns about the meaning of 
various symbols that, like certain words, can convey either positive or 
negative powers. Symbols frequently associated with positive energy 
and good luck include four-leafclovers, rabbits’ feet, ankhs, horseshoes, 
rosary beads, shamrocks, and swallows. Symbols viewed as bad 
or evil include the inverted pentagram, the zodiac, a goat’s head, an 
upside-down cross, and a hand held in a horned position. When people 
encounter negative or evil symbols, they often feel compelled to 
neutralize their effects either by bringing out a positive symbol or by 
engaging in one or more rituals, such as chanting “God please protect 
me and those I love” 14 times.
 
 Words: Some people believe that certain words transmit good energy 
and other words have bad, or even evil, power. Words often thought to 
be infused with inherent good energy include: “good,” “God,” “benefi-
cent,” “love,” “sharing,” “kindness,” “soothe,” and “relax.” Sometimes 
bad words actually have no inherently negative meaning at all for most 
people. They become seen as bad because they are associated with 
an unpleasant event in the person’s life. For example, a woman may 
associate the word “table” with hearing about a loved one’s death 
because she was sitting at a table when she was told about the death. 
Thus, she may feel compelled to cross herself three times whenever she 
hears that word.
The preceding list is very incomplete. Superstitions come in a dizzying 
array of forms. Following are just a few miscellaneous superstitions to give 
you an idea:
 
 Breaking a mirror brings seven years of bad luck.
 
 Leaving your shoes upside down causes bad luck to visit.
 
 Dropping a pair of scissors causes your spouse to be unfaithful.
 
 Failing to compensate anyone who gives you a knife or anything 
sharp causes harm to come to you.
 
 Walking under a ladder brings bad luck.
 
 Failing to lift your feet up when driving over a railroad track causes 
bad luck.
Those with Superstitious OCD take these superstitions very seriously and 
feel compelled to do all kinds of strange things to undo them when the feared 
events occur. We give you only a few sample rituals. Trying to think up a 
ritual that no one actually uses is a little like trying to find a username that no 
one else has ever used.

259
 Chapter 17: Shrinking Superstitious OCD
When people use neutralizing rituals, they typically believe that they must be 
performed with perfect precision. If anything goes wrong in the execution of 
a ritual, it must be repeated over and over until it feels perfect. This repeat-
ing until perfect is similar to “Just So” OCD, which we discuss in Chapter 15.
Changing Thinking about 
OCD Superstitions
People with Superstitious OCD are pretty darned convinced that giving up 
their ways will result in harm to others or themselves. Because they believe 
that not adhering to their superstitious beliefs and behaviors will allow 
something bad to happen, they don’t often volunteer for treatment. Why step 
on that crack when you never know if the one time you do . . . oops, there 
goes your mother’s back. The point is that because people tend to avoid 
checking out, challenging, or testing the validity of their superstitions, they 
never find out whether or not they’re true.
A problem with Superstitious OCD is that the feared consequence is usually 
vague, can’t be disproven, or lies in the distant future. Maybe you worry 
that opening an umbrella inside, seeing an open umbrella, or hearing the 
word “umbrella” in your home will cause bad luck. As a result, you basically 
never go out of the house when it rains and avoid watching the weather on 
the news.
Evil in Washington, D.C.?
The Washington Post reported on a superstition 
that some people believe about the capitol 
of the United States — Washington, D.C. 
Apparently, these folks believe that the city 
harbors profound satanic forces because one 
can draw a demonic pentagram by connecting 
the dots formed by these important landmarks: 
Dupont Circle, Logan Circle, Mount Vernon 
Square, the White House, and Washington 
Circle. Others add to this “evidence” by 
pointing to the fact that the Freemasons had an 
important hand in designing major structures 
throughout the city. They assume that the 
Freemasons collaborated with Satan. Like many 
Americans, we’re not all that pleased by some 
of what goes on in Washington, but we sort of 
doubt it has a lot to do with landmark configura-
tions and Freemasonry. We won’t presume to 
speak for Satan!

260
Part IV: Targeting Specific Symptoms of OCD 
On Tuesday, you hear the word “umbrella” on the lead into the local news; 
you immediately engage in elaborate exorcisms, turning on all the lights in 
the house, arranging the hangers in your closet in a particular way, and 
chanting a prayer 32 times. But, after all that, you go outside and see that the 
car has a flat tire. Your OCD mind convinces you that the flat tire was caused 
by hearing the word “umbrella.” Wow. That brain is pretty clever. Even if 
your tire isn’t flat, you aren’t off the hook. You go to work and at the lunch 
table, a colleague mentions that her cousin has been diagnosed with cancer. 
Your OCD mind tells you the cancer is caused by the utterance of “umbrella.”
You can challenge superstitions in a couple of ways:
 
 One way is to make up competing superstitions and create playful 
scenes.
 
 Another is to learn to handle moderate feelings of discomfort.
We discuss these two change strategies in the next two sections.
 
All OCD change strategies have a slight risk of making you feel worse for a 
little while. That’s especially true for exposure and response prevention 
(ERP), which we discuss in detail in Chapter 10. If you experience any 
excessive uptick in your distress or harbor any concerns or worries about 
conducting any of these exercises, please consult a mental-health professional 
for additional help.
Creating competing superstitions
One way to challenge your Superstitious OCD thinking is to make up compet-
ing stories and practice them. We assume that you have a few troubling 
superstitions in your head. When you are exposed to these superstitions, you 
feel uncomfortable. You have some neutralizing rituals like chants, tapping, 
and counter words.
The idea here is to create what essentially are “fake” superstitions. You 
choose the object of this fake superstition and you decide how it works. 
Because you are making up these competing superstitions, you know they 
really can’t impact you or anyone else. However, by examining these fake 
superstitions and pretending how you would feel if they were real, hopefully 
you’ll gain insight into how to overcome your active superstitions.
 
Make this fun. Be creative and silly.
Get out your notebook and try the following exercise:

261
 Chapter 17: Shrinking Superstitious OCD
 
1. Pick a neutral word, event, color, or happening that is not connected 
to your superstitions in any way.
 
2. Write a few sentences (purely fiction) that turn these words, events, or 
happenings into superstitions.
 
3. Choose a few bad outcomes for encountering this word, event, or 
happening.
 
4. Write out the actions or mental rituals that are necessary in order to 
protect you from the new superstition.
 
 Make sure these actions are not ones you use for your current, active 
superstitions.
 
5. After you’ve completed Steps 1 through 4, reflect on how you feel.
 
 Can you think differently about your active superstitions? Are your real 
superstitions any more logical than the fake one you made up? Yet, 
does the fake one feel a little less worrisome? If so, what does that tell 
you? Write down your reflections.
 
6. Consider designing three, four, or more of these new, fictional 
superstitions.
Being silly with neutral, fake superstitions can loosen up your thinking. 
You’re probably not ready to give up your active superstitions, but maybe 
you’re closer. The next example shows you how one woman used this 
exercise. It also illustrates how Superstitious OCD can become quite quirky.
Kate is required by her OCD to drive at a certain speed that always 
involves her lucky number 6. The speed depends on what is on the radio 
when she starts her car. If there is music, she drives 6 miles faster than 
the posted speed limit. If there is news or talk, she drives 6 miles slower 
than the speed limit. If she does not follow this rule, she believes her 
children will be kidnapped. You can imagine how many times she is 
harassed while driving, which increases her discomfort, as well as her 
certainty that many bad drivers out there may be watching her in order 
to take her children.
Kate consults a psychologist who suggests that she try designing new 
superstitions. This idea sounds a little strange to Kate at first, but she 
decides to give it a try. Here are two brand new superstitions she comes 
up with:
New superstition #1: Yellow lines must be avoided. This is because 
white lines are suggestive of cocaine, an illegal and immoral drug, 
plus, yellow is the color of urine. Yellow lines, therefore, are a double 
whammy. They are both contaminated and evil. If you encounter a yellow 
line, you must cross yourself eight times while thinking, “blue square, 
blue square, blue square . . . .” Saying “blue square” neutralizes the 
yellow line by symbolically blocking its path and turning it green.

262
Part IV: Targeting Specific Symptoms of OCD 
New superstition #2: If you go through the left door to a store, you will 
lose all your money. The reason? “Left” sounds like “leave.” You may 
leave your wallet or purse in the store. So you must enter through the 
right door. If that door is locked, you need to go to another entrance. If 
that isn’t possible, you must not go to that store. Even when you go 
through the right door, you may have bad luck because some of your 
energy may have gone in the left door. Thus, you need to touch eight 
things using your right hand to prevent bad things from happening.
Kate concludes by thinking about what this exercise has taught her. She 
tells her psychologist, “I can see how these new superstitions are almost 
identical to the nature of my real superstitions. I was surprised how easy 
it was to come up with them. Yet, these new ones don’t really bother me 
all that much because I know I made them up. I guess the point is that my 
OCD mind came up with my original superstitions too. Maybe I can start 
challenging these things.”
Kate’s story shows you how easily the mind can spin into superstitious 
thinking. You can make up these things out of thin air. If you try your hand 
at this, you’re likely to see how creative your OCD mind really is. Creative, 
but wrong.
Managing discomfort differently
At the beginning of this chapter, we talk about the way most people automati-
cally respond when they hear a sneeze. Most people do some sort of blessing 
that doesn’t really have much to do with religious belief, superstition, or 
consideration of the other person. Saying “bless you” when someone nearby 
sneezes is a habit.
Nothing is inherently wrong with habits. Habits can be useful. You may brush 
your teeth every day without really thinking about what you’re doing. That’s 
a good habit. If you’re like most people, not engaging in a habit is somewhat 
uncomfortable. For instance, if you’re unable to brush your teeth before you 
go to bed, you probably don’t feel right. And if you have the habit of saying 
“bless you” after a sneeze, then stopping yourself from saying “bless you” 
after someone sneezes is difficult, if not uncomfortable — try it and see.
Smoking cigarettes is often a habit and one that is very hard to break. People 
struggle for years and suffer significant discomfort when attempting to quit 
smoking, partly because smoking is a habit and partly because nicotine is 
highly addictive, which compounds the problem.

263
 Chapter 17: Shrinking Superstitious OCD
Superstitious OCD can be thought of as a habit, too. This superstitious habit 
is not so helpful. If you don’t comply with what your OCD mind tells you 
to do, you’re likely to feel some discomfort — sometimes a lot of discomfort 
at first.
To manage the discomfort you encounter while working to overcome your 
Superstitious OCD, constantly remind yourself of the following points:
 
 All discomfort lessens as you continue to cease your old habitual rituals.
 
 Tolerating discomfort is like building muscles — you have to feel the 
burn and increase weights slowly over time — no pain, no gain.
 
 No one has ever died as a result of confronting their superstitions.
Yes, bad habits and superstitions are hard to break. But persistence and 
willingness to tolerate discomfort will eventually break them down. Consider 
reading Chapter 9 on mindfulness for ideas about how to tolerate discomfort.
Deflating the Power of OCD 
Superstitions with ERP
Exposure and response prevention (ERP) is the cornerstone for the treat-
ment of most types of OCD. And that’s the case for Superstitious OCD as well. 
ERP involves facing your OCD triggers head on, but don’t worry; you won’t 
crash. Odds of success are high when using ERP. However, most people will 
experience greater success if they work in collaboration with a mental-health 
professional trained in this approach.
 
We discuss ERP in considerable detail in Chapter 10. Please review that 
chapter prior to attempting ERP for your Superstitious OCD.
Facing off with scary superstitions
Here we present a typical exposure hierarchy/staircase that exemplifies the 
use of ERP in dealing with suspicions. (The difference between an exposure 
hierarchy and a staircase is simply that an exposure hierarchy is a list of 
steps to be taken, while a staircase is an illustration of this list.) The exact 
nature of your staircase will depend very much upon the nature of your 
individual Superstitious OCD. However, this example hierarchy gives you an 
idea of how to proceed.

Defeating the power of 
superstitious charms
Not all superstitions are scary. For example, wishing someone good luck is 
not necessarily a bad thing and it conveys a positive sentiment. Charms don’t 
make luck, but many people carry them just in case.
Most people with Superstitious OCD believe in the power of good-luck sym-
bols. However, they often turn to good-luck charms in compulsive ways — as 
a means of reducing distress associated with their obsessional, superstitious 
fears. Since overcoming OCD typically involves letting go of compulsions, we 
have a strategy for dealing with these superstitious symbols — even though 

265
 Chapter 17: Shrinking Superstitious OCD
they may appear positive at first glance. This exercise could appear silly to 
those who don’t have Superstitious OCD, but those who suffer from it will 
find it difficult.
Figure 17-1 illustrates some good-luck charms, which are quite likely to apply 
if you have almost any type of Superstitious OCD.
We want you to do something very different than what your OCD mind wants 
you to do with these illustrations. We suggest that you spend some serious 
time on the following exercise:
 
1. Carefully look at, review, and read each and every symbol, picture, 
or word.
 
2. Say the words out loud.
 
3. When you feel ready, cross off the words. You may even consider 
cutting up a photocopy of the page.
 
 (Please don’t deface the book if it doesn’t belong to you — for example, 
if you’ve borrowed it from a library.)
 
4. As you cross the words out (or cut up the page), notice your feelings.
 
5. Stay with this exercise until your feelings of distress are reduced.
 
 You can either make multiple copies of the page and slowly destroy 
each one, or you can continue to cross the words out, over and over. 
You can even repeat phrases such as “I don’t want good luck!” again and 
again. Try to stay with the exercise until your feelings come down by 50 
percent or more.
 
6. Consider making an alternative, bad-luck page with the help of a 
therapist.
 
 You can make this page by surfing the Internet for all kinds of bad-luck 
symbols and words that give you trouble with your Superstitious OCD.
 
7. After you’ve made your alternative page, expose yourself to each 
word and symbol the way you did with the good-luck symbols.
 
 However, in this case, you don’t destroy the page, but rather, you 
expose yourself to it. Read the words and observe the evil symbols. 
You may even consider rubbing the page over your arms and hands.

Chapter 18
Uncovering OCD Accomplices
In This Chapter
 Counting compulsively
 Tapping and touching
 Dwelling on doodling
 Taking too long to do things
C
ounting, touching, doodling, and compulsive slowness often accompany 
the other specific types of OCD we cover in earlier chapters. For exam-
ple, some people with hit-and-run issues who fear running someone over 
with their car may count compulsively while driving in order to shut out their 
obsessive images. Others with Doubting and Checking OCD may feel a need 
to repeatedly touch door handles in specific ways in order to check whether 
the door is locked. Or, someone with Contamination OCD may take slow, 
hour-long showers in order to feel clean enough.
In all such cases, the counting, doodling, touching, and slowness are not 
really distinctly separate types of OCD, although they occasionally present 
as the primary symptom. These symptoms are quite common and often 
difficult to treat. Furthermore, counting, doodling, touching, and compulsive 
slowness tend to capture so much of people’s attention and resources that 
they find themselves unable to carry out important tasks in their lives. So we 
pay special attention to them in this chapter.
We describe people who suffer from these particular OCD symptoms. Each of 
these four types of behaviors can be treated using a two-step approach that 
involves changing how the behaviors are done and then not doing them!
Concerning Counting
The staircase to our private practice offices has 19 stairs. How did we know 
this fascinating fact? Well, umm, as we were writing this chapter, we lapsed 
into a discussion about how common counting compulsions are among those 
with and without full-blown OCD. In our discussion, we discovered that we 

268
Part IV: Targeting Specific Symptoms of OCD 
both count steps from time to time. And we recognized that we do so more 
often at times when we’re feeling a little worried about something, such as 
running late for an appointment or having work pile up on us.
Many people count stairs, steps, and ceiling tiles. Frequently, counting 
does not result in a diagnosis of OCD because it doesn’t take lots of time or 
cause major interference with a person’s life. It may serve to reduce or 
distract people from worrisome, anxious thoughts, or it may just alleviate 
the boredom of sitting in a doctor’s waiting room.
At other times, counting grows to the point that it greatly disrupts a person’s 
life. Those who have this problem count all kinds of things, such as:
 
 Books on a bookshelf
 
 Cars passing
 
 Change and money
 
 Letters in words, names, sentences, or paragraphs
 
 Highway markings and signs
 
 Lines in the sidewalk
 
 Streetlights
Some people count consecutively; others like to count in sets of specific 
numbers, such as groups of four or seven. For example, a man may count 
four sets of seven steps. Or a woman may look out the window and feel 
compelled to count cars in sets of five until she has logged six sets.
Counting effectively blocks out other thoughts. That’s not a problem as long 
as it’s brief or occasional. When counting gets out of control, however, the 
person cannot focus on work or other important life tasks. Counting becomes 
a disturbing compulsion in those cases.
 
Preparation for combating compulsive counting involves self-monitoring. Jot 
down notes about what it is you actually find yourself counting and when you 
usually do it. You may need to spend a few days collecting data to catalog 
your counting.
After you’ve collected information about what and when you count, you’re 
prepared to tackle your counting head-on. We have a couple of strategies for 
you to try in the following two sections:
 
 Misdirecting counting behavior through miscounting
 
 Stopping counting by resisting counting
By the way, how many “c’s” appeared in the past two paragraphs? Well, 
maybe you shouldn’t answer that question.

269
 Chapter 18: Uncovering OCD Accomplices
Miscounting on purpose
One of the best ways to mess up your counting problem is to practice the art 
of miscounting. Miscounting involves intentionally screwing up. Thus, you 
could skip counting a few steps, count one step as three, or count totally out 
of order. The OCD mind doesn’t like messing up in this manner. If you 
attempt this technique, be sure to
 
 Miscount for ever increasingly large blocks of time.
 
 Expect some discomfort and rate that discomfort (see Ugh Factor Rating 
in Chapter 10) each time you miscount.
 
 Pat yourself on the back for each successful attempt to miscount.
Once you’ve experienced some success and a decrease in discomfort from 
miscounting, you’re ready for the next step — resisting counting (see the 
next section).
 
If you do not experience success, consider seeking professional help.
Resisting the act of counting
Resisting counting is rather similar to exposure and response prevention 
(ERP — see Chapter 10 for details). However, unlike most other compulsions, 
counting crops up almost anywhere, anytime. This makes it harder to design 
a set of increasingly difficult steps for an ERP hierarchy or staircase.
Instead, we recommend that you set aside blocks of time when you do not 
count. You can start with brief periods, perhaps as short as five minutes if 
you’re currently counting almost all the time. Then aim for successively 
larger blocks of time in which you resist all counting. Try to do this exercise 
as often as you can — at least several times a day. If you do find yourself 
starting to count, stop. Don’t get upset with yourself; just gently remind your 
OCD mind that you are in charge and will not count for now. Remind yourself 
that the counting isn’t “you,” but merely a product of your OCD mind.
 
In Chapter 8 and elsewhere, we warn about not attempting to suppress 
obsessive thoughts because they will merely increase if you do. Resisting 
compulsive counting is not the same thing as thought suppression. That’s 
because obsessions are unwanted, intrusive thoughts that really can’t be 
effectively suppressed. However, counting is a mental compulsion that is 
designed to decrease anxiety and distress. This kind of compulsion can be 
effectively resisted.

Part IV: Targeting Specific Symptoms of OCD 
Taking Charge of Touching
If you’ve ever watched the popular television series Monk, you may have 
seen detective Monk touch various objects such as parking meters or posts 
while walking down the street. Many people without OCD ritualistically touch 
a series of items from time to time. Again, touching only becomes OCD when 
it takes lots of time or interferes with your life.
Troubling touching can consist of constant tapping of fingers in certain 
sequences, touching every third railing and needing to go back if one is 
missed, tapping wood ritualistically, rubbing smooth or rough surfaces over 
and over, or complicated combinations of foot tapping and hand movements.
 
Distinguishing between motor tics (see Chapters 3 and 19) and touching 
symptoms of OCD can be tricky. Motor tics involve quick, uncontrollable 
movements of various types, but are usually not accompanied by obsessive 
thoughts. You may want to consult a professional trained in OCD diagnosis 
and treatment for help with making this distinction.
The first step in taking charge of your touching is self-monitoring. Spend a 
day or two noticing all the ways in which you ritualistically touch, tap, or rub 
various items or surfaces. Take notes and record when, where, and how you 
touch. Then you can apply a two-step method for addressing OCD touching:
 
 Mixing up your touching patterns
 
 Stopping touching
Messing with your touching
Similar to miscounting noted earlier in this chapter, messing with your 
touching entails changing your touching patterns. Thus, you can:
 
 Change the rhythm of your tapping.
 
 Change the typical surfaces you rub.
 
 Instead of tapping your right foot, try tapping your left foot.
 
 Intentionally miss tapping a few items in a sequence (like lampposts).
 
 Tap harder than usual.
 
 Tap more slowly than you want to.
Notice how you feel when you change your touching patterns. Expect some 
discomfort at first, and be aware that the discomfort is highly likely to 
decrease as you continue.

271
 Chapter 18: Uncovering OCD Accomplices
Discontinuing touching
After you’ve mastered messing with your touching, as we describe in the 
preceding section, you’re ready for the next step, discontinuing touching. 
When you feel like touching something, don’t do it! Of course, it isn’t quite 
that simple. You will probably find it useful to start by not engaging in your 
compulsive touching for an hour or so. Write down your success. Then up 
your goal to an hour and a half, then two hours, then three. You get the idea. 
Ultimately, your compulsion to touch will decrease after you’ve made it 
through an entire day or two. However, you will need to remain vigilant, 
because touching OCD loves to creep back in through the back door when 
you’re not looking.
Doing Away with Doodling
Everyone doodles now and then. Harmless, right? Well, yes, in some cases. 
But with OCD, things tend to run out of control. And it happens with doodling 
just like it does with other OCD symptoms. Compulsive doodlers sometimes 
have favorite themes for their doodling, such as circles, weapons, or mazes.
Those with a doodling problem often become so wrapped up in their doo-
dling that the rest of the world is shut out. This symptom often shows up in 
students. They sit at their desks doodling and may not even hear the lecture 
they’re attending. Even if they do, they certainly can’t take notes. The same 
problem shows up at the office. Some office workers doodle their days away 
and run into trouble with their supervisors for a lack of productivity.
The techniques for doing away with doodling look much like the strategies 
we outline for counting and touching earlier in this chapter. Start by jotting 
down how often, where, and when you doodle. Get a feel for just how much 
trouble it causes you. Then try the following two techniques:
 
 Doodle differently.
 
 Don’t doodle.
Doodling in different ways
Change your doodling patterns in every way you can think of. Most people 
who doodle compulsively have preferred pens, pencils, paper, designs, and 
patterns for their doodling. Regularly change all these things in some way 
or another. The goal is to make doodling as unsatisfying to your OCD mind 
as possible.

272
Part IV: Targeting Specific Symptoms of OCD 
Denying the urge to doodle
Stopping doodling is best executed after you’ve been doodling differently 
for a time. The strategy of just saying no to doodling demands increasing 
amounts of time in which you consciously resist the urge to doodle. You 
slowly build up your tolerance while taking notes, working on your tasks, 
and so on. It helps if you monitor your successes as well as the amount 
of discomfort you feel when you don’t doodle for each block of time 
(see Chapter 10 for details on the Ugh Factor Rating).
Speeding Up Slowness
OCD inevitably slows people down, if for no other reason than because it 
consumes so much of their time. However, sometimes slowness becomes 
the primary problem. Showering can take over an hour — or until all the hot 
water is used up. Getting ready for work can require two or three hours, 
making you chronically late for work. Eating a meal can drag on and on, and 
not just because you’re savoring the food. Some people with compulsive 
slowness speak . . . very . . . very . . . ever so very . . . slowly. You can imagine 
how slowness not only interferes with completing life’s tasks, but also can be 
exquisitely annoying to others.
Those with this OCD symptom are not particularly slow thinkers per se. 
Typically, their slowness represents an attempt to reduce their doubts and 
uncertainty and/or obtain perfection. These people want to make sure they 
complete tasks in a correct or “just so” manner.
 
A few neurological disorders include symptoms of motor slowness as a 
prominent feature. These include Parkinson’s disease and Binswanger’s 
disease, which is a form of vascular dementia. If you or someone you love 
demonstrates problems with compulsive slowness, check it out with your 
family doctor, who may choose to refer you to a neurologist.
Compulsive slowness is a little tricky to treat with standard ERP. However, 
you can address the issues of doubting, uncertainty, and perfectionism 
(which frequently drive this problem) by working carefully through Chapter 
8. Just don’t take too long to work through your issue!
Two types of exposure strategies can be successfully applied to problems 
with slowness — mixing things up and speeding things up.

273
 Chapter 18: Uncovering OCD Accomplices
Mixing things up
Each person’s slowness problem is unique. There are more variations on this 
theme than books in the library. However, most people who live in slow 
motion are looking for certainty and perfection. Therefore, it’s often helpful 
to experiment with an exposure staircase that pushes you to engage in the 
activities that you’re slow at with increasing amounts of uncertainty and 
imperfection.
 
Before you begin, read Chapter 10 for important instructions on how to use 
exposure staircases / hierarchies within ERP. Austin’s story illustrates how he 
uses an exposure hierarchy to speed up his life.
Austin is a freshman in college. He is gifted, but graduated from high 
school with only mediocre grades because of his compulsive slowness. 
He’s often late to class because he is so slow getting ready to leave — he 
combs each hair into place, straightens his clothes, and polishes his 
shoes to perfection. He takes notes slowly and retraces each word to 
make sure that it’s clear. However, this note-taking strategy prevents him 
from getting much of the important material on paper. He passed high 
school because he was bright enough to get away with this inefficiency. 
But now he finds that his notes don’t give him the information he needs 
to pass his tests. His slowness also bogs him down because he reads and 
rereads all his textbook assignments out of fear of not understanding 
everything. He’s behind in all his classes. He seeks counseling at the 
student mental-health center. His therapist persuades him to try an 
exposure hierarchy. Here’s what they come up with:
 
 Not combing my hair at all and going out in public (Ugh Factor 
Rating 90)
 
 Taking really sloppy notes with misspelled words (Ugh Factor Rating 85)
 
 Reading a section in my textbook only once (Ugh Factor Rating 80)
 
 Intentionally mussing up my clothes (Ugh Factor Rating 75)
 
 Taking notes quickly without tracing over letters (Ugh Factor Rating 70)
 
 Polishing one shoe and not the other (Ugh Factor Rating 70)
 
 Turning in a paper that I briefly edit only once (Ugh Factor Rating 65)
 
 Reading a section in my textbook only twice (Ugh Factor Rating 65)
 
 Not folding my underwear (Ugh Factor Rating 50)
 
 Wearing one blue sock and one brown sock (Ugh Factor Rating 45)
 
 Not ironing my bluejeans (Ugh Factor Rating 35)

274
Part IV: Targeting Specific Symptoms of OCD 
Austin completes his hierarchy, which helps him speed up because it gives 
him practice with making mistakes and engaging in imperfection — both of 
which fuel his slowness. Austin’s treatment also involves talking about his 
experiences with the exposure exercises.
Speeding things up
Survey a few close friends or family members and ask them how long they 
spend doing basic tasks such as eating, showering, shaving, brushing teeth, 
getting dressed, grooming, or whatever it is that you’re slow at. Then write 
down the average of their reports and make it your goal to meet or beat 
those lengths of time. Each time you succeed, be sure to reward yourself.
The key here is to try and not go um, er . . . too fast! What we mean is, try and 
speed up about 10 to 20 percent with each attempt until you’ve reached your 
goal. You don’t have to accomplish the goals all at once, but neither do you 
need to take forever getting there.
Here are a few of our suggestions for goals on some basic life tasks. These are 
not set in granite and not based on scientific research — just common sense.
 
 Baths: Under 20 minutes unless you’re wanting an occasional 
relaxing treat
 
 Eating most meals: 30 minutes
 
 Putting on make-up: Under 15 minutes
 
 Selecting clothes and getting dressed: Under 15 minutes
 
 Showering: Under 10 minutes
 
 Brushing your teeth: 2 minutes (a typical electric toothbrush times 
out then)
Other tasks that involve slowness, like writing or reading, are more difficult 
to assign exact goals to. Review your own particular slowness issues and 
try to design some common-sense solutions. If you have trouble doing so, 
consider seeing a therapist for some help.

Chapter 19
Dealing with OCD-Related 
Impulsive Problems
In This Chapter
 Looking at impulsive problems like tics and habits
 Undoing problematic behaviors and thinking
 Halting these behaviors with Habit Reversal Training (HRT)
T
ics, Tourette’s syndrome, trichotillomania, skin-picking, and nail-biting 
all fall under the category of impulsive problems — tics and habits that 
are driven by sudden impulses. Tics are repetitive, rapid vocalizations or 
movements that are difficult to suppress. Such noises include grunts, groans, 
barks, and swear words, whereas movements may involve rapid head jerks, 
eye blinks, facial grimaces, and so on. Impulsive habits are repetitive and 
difficult to suppress, including pulling out one’s hair (trichotillomania), 
picking at one’s skin, and biting one’s nails. (See Chapter 3 for more detailed 
descriptions of each of these disorders.)
Many experts believe that these problems have some connection to OCD, 
but they are not officially considered to be part of OCD at this time. They 
do, however, frequently co-occur with OCD. Like OCD, people report that 
they have great difficulty stopping these behaviors. Unlike OCD, these 
behaviors are largely thought to occur as a way of self-soothing or obtaining 
a pleasurable feeling rather than reducing fear, anxiety, and distress. 
However, some people with these habits report engaging in them as a way 
of reducing distress, so the distinction may not hold for everyone.
In this chapter, we review the primary strategies for undoing these problem-
atic behaviors and habits. Most importantly, we tell you about a treatment 
that was developed in the 1970s by Drs. Nathan Azrin and Gregory Nunn 
called Habit Reversal Training (HRT). Today HRT remains one of the most 
widely employed treatment approaches to these issues. We conclude with a 
discussion of important thinking habits to acquire in order to succeed and 
maintain your gains.

276
Part IV: Targeting Specific Symptoms of OCD 
We review other cousins of OCD in Chapter 3 that we do not discuss in 
this chapter because treating them entails greater complexity. These 
problem areas include body dysmorphic disorder, eating disorders, patho-
logical gambling, kleptomania, hypochondriasis, pyromania, and various 
paraphilias. If one of these problems seems to apply to you, we recommend 
that you seek professional help.
Changing Behavior to Reduce 
Impulsive Problems
Addressing OCD-related impulsive problems can be difficult. That’s because 
these impulsive habits tend to occur with little or no conscious thought or 
awareness. They are well-ingrained habits, and most people have them for 
years before they attempt to change them.
Habit Reversal Training (HRT) has been the most heavily researched strategy 
for these problems and usually works quite well. HRT, like exposure and 
response prevention (ERP) therapy (see Chapter 10), involves extended 
periods of time in which the person refrains from the problematic behavior. 
However, unlike ERP, it attempts to instill a new behavior that competes with 
the habit.
HRT consists of four major components:
 
 Increasing your awareness of when your problematic behaviors and 
habits are occurring.
 
 Many people report that they are almost completely unaware of when 
they have tics, pull their hair, or pick at their skin.
 
 Learning how to relax as a way of handling stressors that sometimes 
set off problematic behaviors and habits.
 
 Learning new, alternative behaviors.
 
 This strategy is particularly important.
 
 Seeing how to keep yourself motivated with self-rewards.
 
Some professionals used to believe that if you eliminated problematic behav-
iors such as tics and hair pulling, you would simply find another bad habit 
to replace it. However, studies have consistently failed to verify this concern. 
Thus, if you succeed in ridding yourself of a problem behavior, you are good 
to go.

277
 Chapter 19: Dealing with OCD-Related Impulsive Problems
Increasing awareness of your 
impulsive problems
Increasing awareness of your tics and habits helps prepare you for the 
rest of HRT. We recommend at least a week of careful monitoring. Although 
it’s something of a pain, make note of the following during that time:
 
 The time of day you feel an urge.
 
 Where you are when an urge strikes.
 
 How you feel when you have an urge (happy, sad, anxious, angry, 
and so on).
 
 What you are doing when you feel an urge (watching television, reading, 
and so forth).
 
 How you feel after you engage in your tic or habit, or how you feel if you 
don’t engage in the problematic behavior.
 
 Describe your behavior in detail. If it’s a tic, note which part of the body 
is moving or what sound is made. If it’s hair-pulling, note where you’re 
pulling the hair from and whether you use one hand or two.
 
Some people worry that increasing awareness of their tics, urges, and habits 
will make them all increase. If you have that concern, relax. Studies show that 
increasing awareness does nothing to increase symptoms and sometimes 
reduces them somewhat, at least for a while. However, you need to carry out 
the rest of HRT in order to reduce symptoms permanently.
Relaxing away impulsive problems
The second step in HRT is what’s known as progressive muscle relaxation 
training. Dr. Edmund Jacobsen developed this strategy more than 50 years 
ago. Literally hundreds of studies have shown that this technique can 
improve anxiety and health in numerous ways, although among the four 
components of HRT, relaxation may be the least important. Here is a set of 
instructions for progressive muscle relaxation that appeared in our earlier 
book, Overcoming Anxiety For Dummies (also from Wiley):
 
1. Take a deep breath, hold, imagine, and let the tension go.
 
 Pulling the air in from your abdomen, breathe deeply. Hold your breath 
for three or four seconds and slowly let the air out. Imagine your whole 
body is a balloon losing air as you exhale and let tension go out with the 
air. Take three more such breaths and feel your entire body getting 
more limp with each one.

278
Part IV: Targeting Specific Symptoms of OCD 
 
2. Squeeze your hands tight and then relax.
 
 Squeeze your fingers into a fist. Feel the tension and hold it for six to 
ten seconds. Then, all at once, release your hands and let them go limp. 
Allow the tension in your hands to flow out. Let the relaxation deepen 
for 10 to 15 seconds.
 
3. Tighten your arms and relax.
 
 Bring your lower arms up almost to your shoulders and tighten the 
muscles. Make sure you tense the muscles on the inside and outside of 
both the upper and lower arms. If you’re not sure you’re doing that, use 
one hand to do a tension check on the other arm. Hold the tension a 
little while and then drop your arms as though you cut a string holding 
them up. Let the tension flow out and the relaxation flow in.
 
4. Raise up your shoulders, tighten, and then relax.
 
 Raise your shoulders up as though you were a turtle trying to get into 
its shell. Hold the tension and then let your shoulders drop. Feel the 
relaxation deepen for 10 to 15 seconds.
 
5. Tighten and relax the muscles in your upper back.
 
 Pull your shoulders back and bring your shoulder blades closer 
together. Hold that tension a little while . . . and let it go.
 
6. Scrunch up your entire face and then relax.
 
 Squeeze your forehead down, bring your jaws together, tighten your 
eyes and eyebrows, and contract your tongue and lips. Let the tension 
grow and hold it . . . then relax and let go.
 
7. Tighten and relax your neck in the back of your head.
 
 Without causing any pain, gently pull your head back toward your back 
and feel the muscles tighten in the back of your neck. Notice that ten-
sion and hold it, let go, and relax. Feel relaxation deepening and repeat it 
if you want.
 
8. Contract the front neck muscles and then loosen.
 
 Gently move your chin toward your chest. Tighten your neck muscles 
and let the tension increase and maintain it; then relax. Feel the tension 
melting away like candle wax.
 
9. Tighten the muscles in your stomach and chest and maintain the 
tension. Then let it go.
 
10. Arch your back, hang on to the contraction, and then relax.
 
 Be gentle with your lower back and skip it entirely if you’ve ever had 
trouble with this part of your body. Tighten these muscles by arching 
your lower back, pressing it back against the chair, or tensing the 
muscles any way you want. Gently increase and maintain the tension, 
but not too much. Now, relax and allow the waves to roll in.

279
 Chapter 19: Dealing with OCD-Related Impulsive Problems
 
11. Contract and relax your buttocks muscles.
 
 Tighten your buttocks so as to gently lift yourself up in your chair. Hold 
the tension. Then let tension melt and relaxation grow.
 
12. Squeeze and relax your thigh muscles.
 
 Tighten and hold these muscles. Then relax and feel the tension draining 
out; let the calm deepen and spread.
 
13. Contract and relax your calves.
 
 Tighten the muscles in your calves by pulling your toes toward your 
face. Take care; if you ever get muscle cramps, don’t overdo. Hold the 
tension . . . let go. Let tension drain into the floor.
 
14. Gently curl your toes, maintain the tension, and then relax.
 
15. Take a little time to tour your entire body.
 
 Notice whether you feel different than when you began. If you find any 
areas of tension, allow the relaxed areas around the tense areas to come 
in and replace them. If that doesn’t work, repeat the tense-and-relax 
procedure for the tense area.
 
16. Spend a few minutes enjoying the relaxed feelings.
 
 Let relaxation spread and penetrate every muscle fiber in your body. 
Notice any feelings you have. You may feel warmth, or you may feel a 
floating sensation. Perhaps you’ll feel a sense of sinking down. Whatever 
it is, allow it to happen. When you want, you can open your eyes and go 
on with your day, perhaps feeling like you just returned from a brief 
vacation.
CDs and recordings of progressive muscle relaxation techniques are available 
on the Internet and in bookstores. Some people like to record their own 
version — if you want to go that way, feel free to use or change our wording 
and make your own, personalized recording.
Practice relaxation every day for at least a couple of weeks. As you get more 
skilled, you may discover that you can relax more quickly by condensing 
several muscle groups into one. For example, you could tighten your hands, 
arms, and shoulders together and relax them at the same time. Then you 
could tighten your upper back, face, and neck muscles simultaneously and 
relax them. After a while, you may find that you can completely relax within a 
few minutes.
 
You can find a number of additional relaxation techniques in Overcoming 
Anxiety For Dummies. No definitive studies suggest that one approach is far 
superior to others. What’s important is finding a strategy that really works for 
you. Feel free to experiment.

If your impulsive problem involves any kind of intentional cutting on your 
body until bleeding occurs, you should seek professional help for the 
problem. HRT may ultimately play some role, but consulting a trained 
mental-health professional will likely be very helpful. We also recommend 
professional consultations if you do not make good progress on your own for 
any of the problems we describe in this chapter.
Sidetracking impulsive problems 
with something different
Possibly the most crucial aspect of HRT is designing a new response to 
compete with the old habit or behavior. Ideally, this new response uses 
virtually the same muscles as the tic or habit. It also needs to be something 
you can do in public without appearing obvious. It’s best to take each tic or 
habit one at a time — after you’ve succeeded with one, you can move on to 
another one.
You may wonder what these competing responses look like. Table 19-1 shows 
you an array of possibilities. You may want to use one or more of these, but 
your own particular tic or habit may not be included. In that case, you can 
probably design your own by using these as a guide.
Table 19-1 
Examples of Impulsive Problems and 
 
Suggested Competing Responses
Compulsive Problem
Competing Responses
Hair-pulling (habit — trichotillomania)
Make a fist; squeeze a soft ball; 
squeeze the arms of your chair
Facial grimace (tic)
Tighten your lips together; clench your 
teeth
Eye-blinking (tic)
Open your eyes as wide as possible
Nail-biting (habit)
Make a fist; squeeze a soft ball; 
squeeze the arms of your chair
Noises — grunts, groans, barks, and so 
on (tics)
Keeping your mouth closed, inhale 
slowly and deeply through the nose, 
then exhale slowly
Shoulder shrugs (tic)
Push shoulders back against chair; 
make a fist and push it into the palm of 
the other hand
Head jerks (tic)
Tilt head down toward the chest
(continued)

Competing Responses
Hand and arm jerks (tic)
Make a fist and push it into the palm of 
the other hand with some force
Skin-picking (habit)
Make a fist; squeeze a soft ball; 
squeeze the arms of your chair
Once you’ve designed and planned your competing responses, you’re ready 
to start using them. Whenever you feel an urge or strong desire to engage in a 
tic or habit, immediately begin your competing response. Maintain that 
response for several minutes — later you can shorten the time to a minute or 
less. Try not to stop until the urge has lessened.
Reinforcing positive gains in overcoming 
impulsive problems
Now for the good part. Reinforcing or rewarding your good efforts is 
important. Of course you can always treat yourself in various ways such as 
indulging in a favorite food, going out to a movie, reading a great book, or 
buying yourself something special.
However, the best way of keeping your motivation high is to enlist the help of 
some trusted friends or family. Tell them what you’re doing and ask them to 
encourage you and remind you to keep at it. See Chapter 22 for ideas about 
how to use coaches and support people — you certainly don’t need them 
nagging you!
Changing Thinking to Reduce 
Impulsive Problems
Tackling tics and habits doesn’t make any “Top Ten” lists of the “Easiest and 
Most Fun Things You Can Do.” Rather, ridding yourself of these scoundrels 
takes hard work and determination. We find that it helps if you tinker with 
your thinking as a way of obtaining and maintaining momentum. In the follow-
ing sections, we recommend a little work on four particular areas of thinking. 
These areas are:
 
 Choosing to change

282
Part IV: Targeting Specific Symptoms of OCD 
 
 Confronting hopelessness
 
 Setting unfairness aside
 
 Being self-supporting
Finding reasons to change
Many people we see report that their tics or habits have hung around their 
necks since they were bordering on pubescence. And they come to us for 
help when they are middle-aged adults, meaning they have waited several 
decades or longer to finally deal with the issue. Such long delays in seeking 
treatment usually occur due to deep shame over the problem. Other people 
wait because they attempt to minimize the issue and pretend that it’s no 
big deal.
In either case, you’re likely to benefit from developing a list of reasons for 
dealing with your problematic habit or tic. Think of every imaginable motiva-
tion you have for finally loosening the chokehold your habits and tics have 
on your life. Here are a few such incentives that people have mentioned to us:
 
 I hate it when someone notices my problem and asks me about it.
 
 I live in constant fear of embarrassment and rejection.
 
 I no longer want to feel the constant pressure to hide and cover up my 
problem.
 
 I want to feel in charge of my life rather than feeling like my tics 
(or habits) have the upper hand.
 
 These habits distract me from tasks that I need to accomplish.
You get the idea. You likely have many reasons for making these changes. 
Remind yourself what those reasons are as you proceed. If your motivation 
happens to wane at any point, consider reading or rereading Chapter 6 for 
ideas on how to overcome obstacles and resistance to change.
Pushing hopelessness aside
Many people report slipping into thoughts of hopelessness when they try 
to break stubborn habits. If you find yourself having thoughts such as, “I’ll 
never overcome this,” “I thought I was getting somewhere, but this slip 
obviously means I haven’t learned a thing,” or “I can’t even imagine getting 

283
 Chapter 19: Dealing with OCD-Related Impulsive Problems
over this problem,” you need to jump on such self-defeating thoughts. You 
can start by answering the following questions:
 
 Have I ever tackled my tics or habits with professional assistance 
before?
 
 Have I ever experienced an extended time when I successfully dealt with 
my habits? If so, is it possible I can build upon that experience?
 
 Have I ever succeeded at anything that seemed impossible at the time?
 
 Have I ever tried HRT or ERP for these problems?
Scott has a vocal tic in which he constantly clears his throat, and he bites 
his nails. He has had both of these problems since he was an adolescent 
and feels terribly embarrassed about them. He used the preceding 
questions to overcome his thoughts of hopelessness because he’d made 
a number of attempts to overcome these problems, but had failed each 
time. Here are Scott’s answers to these questions:
 
 Have I ever tackled my tics or habits with professional assistance 
before?
 
 My doctor put me on medication for smoking, but it didn’t help. I have 
never seen a therapist for this stuff, but maybe that could help.
 
 Have I ever experienced an extended time when I successfully dealt 
with my habits? If so, is it possible I can build upon that experience?
 
 I did manage to quit smoking after about 20 tries. And I did stop my 
nail-biting for three months once. So maybe if I keep at it . . . .
 
 Have I ever succeeded at anything that seemed impossible at 
the time?
 
 Yes, I recall getting through graduate school. I never thought I’d make it.
 
 Have I ever tried HRT or ERP for these problems?
 
 I’d never heard of HRT or ERP before I read Obsessive-Compulsive 
Disorder For Dummies. Maybe it can help.
Answering these questions helped Scott realize that changing habits is not a 
hopeless undertaking. He now feels more hopeful about making difficult, but 
desired, changes.

Part IV: Targeting Specific Symptoms of OCD 
Undoing unfairness worries
Sometimes people defeat themselves by dwelling on how terribly unfair and 
unjust it is that they have one or more of these problems and have to work so 
hard to change them. They typically feel angry about the fact that the world 
has dealt them such a lousy hand.
If any of this thinking sounds like something you hear rattling around in your 
head, try to reconsider. Every person we’ve ever known struggles with 
difficult issues. Traumas, death, financial setbacks, and emotional struggles 
present formidable foes for everyone at one time or another throughout a 
lifetime. Focusing on the unfairness and injustice of it all merely takes your 
eye off the ball. Remind yourself, “Of course it isn’t ‘fair’ that I have this prob-
lem, but I need to dwell on doing something about it, not on how unfair it is.”
Designing supportive self-statements
Sometimes preparing a few straightforward self-statements helps you stay 
focused. Self-statements are simply thoughts that you say to yourself as 
reminders and motivators. Here are a few that you may find useful. Feel free 
to use our examples, change the wording a little, or design your own:
 
 I know I am entering a situation that sets my habit off; get ready!
 
 Urges are tough, but each and every time I resist them, I build up more 
strength.
 
 I want to take charge of my life again!
 
 Control takes time; patience is the key.
 
 When I “fail,” I can still learn from the process if I simply don’t beat up 
on myself.
Consider jotting down one or more of these statements on a 3"-x-5" card. 
Carry the card around with you as a reminder. You can do this!
Applying ERP to Impulsive Problems
Although far less studied than HRT for tics, ERP has shown promising results 
for this problem. Essentially, people with tics are asked to undergo multiple 
two-hour sessions in which they are exposed to situations that represent 
a high risk of causing tics to occur. The usual staircases are not used here 

285
 Chapter 19: Dealing with OCD-Related Impulsive Problems
because the high-risk situations typically are often not easily distinguished in 
terms of difficulty.
During these exposure sessions, the individuals try to suppress the tics 
and are also asked to concentrate on the body areas involved with their tics. 
Therapists usually act as coaches at first, and then clients are asked to 
practice religiously at home.
Treating Impulsive Problems 
with Medication
 
If you are considering taking medication for an impulse control disorder, 
make sure you go to a physician who has training and experience in managing 
these problems. The doctor may have to try several different drugs or drug 
combinations before finding the best treatment for you.
Tourette’s syndrome and tics are difficult to treat with medication. 
Antipsychotic drugs are often helpful in controlling tics. However, the long-
term use of these drugs can result in tardive dyskinesia, a serious disorder 
characterized by involuntary movements. These movements are repetitive 
and may include facial grimacing, sticking out the tongue, lip smacking, 
or purposeless movements of the arms, legs, or fingers. You can imagine 
that a person who already has tics is not going to want to suffer from these 
side effects.
Other newer drugs called atypical antipsychotics are also used. Side effects 
appear to be less severe, but concerns about the long-term use of these 
medications still exist. Clonidine, a drug designed to lower high blood pres-
sure, sometimes works to control tics. The side effects can include fatigue, 
dry mouth, and dizziness.
Hair-pulling, skin-picking, and nail-biting have not been as well researched 
as tic disorders. Often, people with these habits have other problems going 
on as well, such as social anxiety, depression, or OCD. Selective serotonin 
reuptake inhibitors have been used with some success to treat the latter 
conditions, but not so much for hair-pulling, skin-picking, and nail-biting.
The best advice: Try working on your impulse control problem by using 
a behavioral treatment such as HRT. Work hard and get help from a 
therapist. If that doesn’t work, then consider consulting with a psychiatrist, 
neurologist, or other physician who specializes in these problems.

Your Child Has OCD
In This Chapter
 Recognizing symptoms

 Discovering what isn’t OCD
 Finding help
M
illions of adults throughout the world suffer from OCD, and for most 
of them, the signs and symptoms began in childhood or adolescence. 
Unfortunately, OCD is under-diagnosed in children, just as it is in adults. 
Because kids with OCD often go untreated, they frequently experience bullying 
and social rejection by peers. Other kids often label their behavior “weird” or 
“crazy.” The time consumed by obsessions and compulsions and their highly 
distracting nature often cause kids with OCD to do poorly in school.
In this chapter, we give you information about what OCD looks like in chil-
dren and point out some common childhood disorders that can be confused 
with OCD. If you think your child may have OCD, we tell you where to go 
in order to know for sure. Although we can’t tell you how to diagnose your 
child, we can give you information that should help you know whether your 
concerns should be checked out further.
Understanding Childhood OCD
Kids don’t go to their parents saying, “I’ve been having lots of trouble with 
terrible obsessions and compulsions.” In fact, they typically try to hide their 
symptoms out of shame and embarrassment. Sometimes they even think they 
might be crazy.

290
Par t V: Assisting Others with OCD 
 
Obsessions are recurrent, unwanted thoughts, images, or urges. Compulsions 
are the actions (either mental or behavioral) that are practiced to decrease 
distress or neutralize obsessive thoughts.
Children may not be able to talk about obsessions because they don’t have 
the vocabulary or insight necessary to do so. They describe obsessions only 
as powerful feelings of fear or of things just not being right. Compulsions are 
more likely than obsessions to be observed by parents.
Recognizing possible symptoms
If kids aren’t likely to discuss their obsessive worries or compulsive actions, 
how can you, as a parent, know whether your child has OCD? Well, you can 
look for various signs. Don’t become too obsessed with this list. All kids have 
a few of these sorts of problems from time to time. Nevertheless, the following 
signs and symptoms may be worth checking out:
 
 Asking parents or family members to repeat a phrase over and over
 
 Counting out loud repeatedly
 
 Demanding symmetry in objects, dinnerware, and furniture
 
 Being excessively concerned about their appearance and clothing
 
 Showing an excessive interest in feces or urine, including collecting them
 
 Spending an excessive amount of time getting ready for bed at night
 
 Worrying excessively about religion or going to hell
 
 Keeping completely unorganized collections of largely worthless stuff
 
 Displaying extreme irritability or anger when their usual routines are 
disrupted
 
 Fearing unlucky numbers and showing considerable interest in lucky 
numbers
 
 Needing frequent reassurance regarding their own health
 
 Worrying frequently about the fire alarms or home safety
 
 Making lots of erasures on schoolwork
 
 Being overly concerned with getting dirty
 
 Questioning parents about sanitation or cleanliness
 
 Checking door locks or windows repeatedly
 
 Asking questions repeatedly about parents’ health and well-being
 
 Going through doorways over and over
 
 Touching items repeatedly in a ritualistic way

291
 Chapter 20: Determining Whether Your Child Has OCD
 
 Tracing over words repeatedly on schoolwork
 
 Repeating the same phrase over and over
 
 Needing an increasing amount of time to get ready in the morning
 
 Having trouble completing tests on time at school
 
 Spending unusually long periods of time washing hands or showering
 
 Adhering very strictly to routines
 
 Worrying about contamination from radiation or other toxins
 
This list is not exhaustive, nor does a single item allow for a diagnosis of OCD 
to be made. The difference between OCD and normality can be subtle. Plus, 
a fair amount of subjectivity is involved in discerning what is excessive or 
unusual as opposed to what’s reasonable and normal. The key is to determine 
whether these issues are starting to interfere with your child’s or your family’s life. 
If you feel worried about the signs your child is demonstrating, you need to 
consult with a mental-health professional.
Ruling out normal growth 
and health issues
Rituals that are transient (meaning they fade over time) are a normal part of 
childhood around the ages of three to seven. For example, most kids enjoy 
specific bedtime routines. They also like to line up toys in specific patterns 
and even “order” their parents to sit in certain seats. Children typically out-
grow these behaviors, and the behaviors don’t significantly interfere with the 
family or the children’s lives.
Childhood OCD most often starts before adolescence. In boys, it usually starts 
showing up by around the second or third grade. Girls typically show signs of 
OCD a little later. If symptoms start before the age of five, something else may 
be going on (see the sidebar “These PANDAS are not cute”), and you should 
check with your pediatrician.
Sorting through other childhood disorders
Diagnosing OCD can be complicated because the symptoms of OCD can look 
like symptoms of other childhood disorders, and children with OCD are likely 
to have other problems. That’s why it is especially important to have your 
child assessed by a mental-health professional experienced in the diagnosis 
and treatment of OCD. OCD can either accompany or sometimes be confused 
with the following:

292
Par t V: Assisting Others with OCD 
 
 Anxiety disorders: Although OCD is considered to be one of the anxiety 
disorders, other problems like separation anxiety (extreme fear of leav-
ing a parent), social anxiety (extreme shyness and fear of rejection), or 
generalized anxiety (excessive worrying about many things) frequently 
accompany OCD.
 
 Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD): When children are 
consumed by obsessive thoughts and compulsive rituals, they fail to pay 
attention. Children are commonly given a diagnosis of ADHD when OCD 
is the real culprit. ADHD can also accompany OCD. Common symptoms 
of ADHD include distractibility, impulsivity (talking and behaving with-
out thinking), and inattentiveness.
 
 Behavior disorders (including Oppositional Defiant Disorder and 
conduct disorders): Kids with one of these problems demonstrate defi-
ance, disobedience, and disruptiveness. They break rules and are easily 
angered. Children with OCD sometimes seem defiant, but that’s usually 
because parents, siblings, and teachers fail to understand their unusual 
behaviors and beliefs. For example, children can become very angry and 
stubborn when their parents push them to do homework, get ready for 
school or bedtime, and interrupt their compulsive routines.
 
 Depression: Kids with OCD may withdraw from others because they are 
embarrassed by their symptoms and that withdrawal may be mistaken 
as depression. On the other hand, kids with OCD may become clinically 
depressed as a result of or in addition to their OCD. Typical signs of 
depression include sadness, loss of interest, withdrawal, low energy, 
appetite changes, and problems with sleep.
These PANDAS are not cute
Antibodies are designed to attack germs and aid 
in recovery. Sometimes these antibodies get out 
of control and attack normal, healthy parts of the 
body. The result of this phenomenon is called 
autoimmune disease. Strep throat, a common 
childhood illness, can produce antibodies that 
attack normal, healthy structures. This attack 
results in PANDAS or pediatric autoimmune 
neuropsychiatric disorders associated with 
streptococcal infection. Although there are no 
specific lab tests for PANDAS, a positive strep 
throat culture is one of the diagnostic criteria.
The symptoms mimic OCD. They come on 
quickly after the infection, are usually severe, 
and often include tremors, twitches, clumsi-
ness, sensitivity, and extreme fear and anxi-
ety. PANDAS can be successfully treated with 
medication and Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy 
(CBT). However, in several successful clinical 
trials, children have received treatment that 
removes the strep antibodies — resulting in a 
dramatic reduction of symptoms.

293
 Chapter 20: Determining Whether Your Child Has OCD
 
 Learning disabilities: Kids with OCD can look like they have problems 
learning because they’re not completing schoolwork or paying atten-
tion. Therefore, they may have poor grades. Learning disabilities are 
neurologically based problems and are diagnosed by a school or clinical 
psychologist.
 
 Pervasive developmental disorders (including Asperger’s Disorder and 
autism): This set of problems involves severe impairment of social inter-
actions and restricted interests. Thus, children with one of these prob-
lems may show unusual, keen interest in specific topics, such as airplanes 
or dinosaurs, but not in pleasing or getting to know other people. Kids 
with these pervasive developmental disorders also often have trouble 
with changes and transitions in routines and activities. The rigid interests 
and routines can sometimes look like obsessions and compulsions.
 
 Tic disorders (including Tourette’s syndrome): Tics are sudden, recur-
rent motor movements or vocalizations (such as grunts, groans, snorts, 
words, barks, obscenities) that occur spontaneously and involuntarily. 
They can be suppressed for a little while, but are largely out of the per-
son’s control. OCD very often accompanies tics and Tourette’s, but most 
of those with OCD do not have tics or Tourette’s. Sometimes compulsive 
routines in OCD that involve tapping, making certain noises, or saying 
phrases can seem like tics.
 
 Other disorders: OCD symptoms can mimic or be confused with other 
disorders of childhood.
 
• OCD can disrupt eating. Children with OCD may not eat particular 
foods fearing contamination or even believing that the foods are 
somehow unlucky or that eating those foods could cause someone 
else harm. They may also need to line up their foods in strange pat-
terns or orders. These problems with eating need to be carefully 
differentiated from eating disorders such as bulimia and anorexia. 
Bulimia and anorexia are serious and require professional treat-
ment. You may want to get a copy of Eating Disorders For Dummies 
by Susan Schulherr (Wiley).
 
• Children with OCD can have problems with elimination, including 
a fear of using public toilets. This can result in toileting accidents 
and be confused with encopresis or enuresis (failure to control 
bowel movements and urine).
 
• Selective mutism is a disorder of childhood in which the child does 
not speak, except to close family members. Though unusual, chil-
dren with OCD may behave in similar ways because of an obses-
sional fear of talking to strangers.
 
• Some children who have been separated from their parents, 
abused, or neglected develop attachment disorders in which they 
have trouble becoming securely attached to their caregivers. Kids 
with OCD may look like they have these problems because they’re 
afraid that showing affection may cause harm or contaminate them 
or their parents in some way.

294
Par t V: Assisting Others with OCD 
 
You can see that the diagnoses of childhood disorders can be quite compli-
cated. If you’re concerned about your child, make sure you choose a mental-
health professional who has experience in assessment and diagnosis.
 
Some professionals are experts in assessment and diagnosis of emotional, 
neurological, learning, and behavior disorders. These professionals clarify 
the diagnosis, make specific recommendations, and then refer their clients to 
others for treatment.
Observing the Effects of OCD
The way OCD plays out in different contexts, settings, and relationships can 
vary, adding more difficulty to a diagnosis. As a parent, being aware of what’s 
going on with your child in settings both in and out of your home is impor-
tant. The next three sections show you how OCD affects home life, school 
performance, and relationships with peers. At least half of all kids with OCD 
find that one or more of these areas become highly impaired.
Having problems at home
OCD disturbs not only the kids who have it, but all of their family members 
as well. Morning routines can evolve into disasters. OCD makes kids take too 
long to wash, dress, eat, or gather materials for the day. When parents start 
to push or nag, children with OCD get extremely angry and sometimes throw 
tantrums. Bedtime can also be horrible, with rigid routines and rituals steal-
ing time from homework. These delays also cause children to lose sleep and 
then feel tired the next morning. Tension, worry, and stress cause many kids 
with OCD to feel sick to their stomachs and have headaches or muscle aches.
OCD sucks in family members like an industrial-strength vacuum cleaner. 
Parents and/or siblings may become involved in supporting OCD rituals. For 
example, the kids may ask their parents to wash ostensibly contaminated 
clothes repeatedly. They may demand that meals be served in odd orders 
or containers. Brothers or sisters may be recruited to check doors and win-
dows. And all family members may be required to provide frequent reassur-
ance. We tell you what to do about all of these demands in Chapter 21.
On occasion, teachers report that they see none of the problems at school 
that the parents of OCD kids report seeing at home. When parents hear that 
their kids are doing just fine at school, they mistakenly assume that their kids 
are just being defiant. This assumption makes the parents irritated, which only 
worsens the situation. It’s important to realize that OCD can show up only at 
home and still be OCD.

295
 Chapter 20: Determining Whether Your Child Has OCD
Experiencing problems at school
Although less common, OCD can appear at school and be minimally obvious 
at home. When OCD overtakes the mind, school can become a nightmare.
Children with OCD are usually bright and try to be well-behaved. Yet they 
may get into trouble for not paying attention, not completing work, and being 
off task. Teachers may not understand what is going on and believe that the 
OCD child is being disrespectful, uncooperative, and oppositional.
Children with OCD have recurring, distressing thoughts that keep them from 
paying attention to class work. These kids frequently have fears of making 
mistakes and are extreme perfectionists. They are tortured by the possibility 
of errors and therefore erase and redo the same problem over and over. This 
over-concern often keeps them from completing assignments.
Those children with fears about contamination may worry obsessively about 
getting sick from touching objects or other children. They may demand 
frequent bathroom breaks to wash. They may also refuse to participate in 
required classroom activities (such as cleaning up or collecting papers) due 
to fear of contact with dirt or germs.
Furthermore, children with OCD often have additional disorders, such as 
depression, attention deficit disorder, or tic disorders, that also interfere 
with learning. We discuss these other disorders in the section “Sorting 
through other childhood disorders.”
Having difficulties with friends
Children with OCD are often isolated from others. They may have unusual 
rituals or behaviors, causing other children to tease or ridicule them. Full of 
fear, they are often victims of bullying.
Obsessions and compulsions take considerable time. Children with OCD 
don’t have time to make and keep friends. Repetitive thoughts and rituals 
keep OCD children prisoners of their minds and outcasts among peers.

Par t V: Assisting Others with OCD 
Finding the Right Help for Your Child
If you have a child who may have OCD or another disorder that is causing prob-
lems at home or at school, you must become informed and educated about the 
services in your area. We talk about the various professionals in Chapter 7, and 
in Appendix A, we list specific organizations and resources for you.
The good news is that research indicates that the first line of treatment for 
childhood OCD is CBT. Medications can be considered when risks and ben-
efits are carefully weighed and follow-through is sufficient. We illustrate how 
these treatments can be applied to children in Chapter 21.
The bad news is that some mental-health professionals lack training and 
experience in the delivery of these research-backed, effective treatments. 
Finding a good therapist for your child depends on you doing some work. 
Talk to others, get referrals from your healthcare provider, check out the 
lists of resources in Appendix A, and then call providers and ask questions. 
If a provider does not answer phone calls, that’s not a great sign. Here are 
some questions you may want to ask:
 
 Are you willing to cooperate with my child’s physician, teacher, or 
school counselor?
 
 Are you willing to provide extra sessions, longer sessions, or sessions 
out of the office?
 
 Do you do exposure and response prevention (ERP) with children?
 
 Do you have training and experience in CBT for OCD?
 
 Do you work with children or adolescents?
 
 Will you develop work to complete outside of the therapy?
If you are satisfied with the answers to the questions above, then make 
arrangements to meet with the mental-health professional. Make sure that 
you feel comfortable and respected.
 
Your child may resist going to therapy at first, and may even throw a tantrum. 
After all, confronting fears and worries can be pretty scary. You have to bal-
ance your need to protect your child with what is best for your child. If your 
child needed a shot of antibiotics to treat a bad infection, you wouldn’t hesi-
tate to go to a doctor for the shot — even if it meant dragging your kicking, 
screaming child all the way to the doctor’s office. OCD is a treatable disorder. 
Without treatment, it’s likely to get worse and make your family’s life more 
miserable. Be firm, and get your child help.

aybe you’ve thought that your child has OCD, and a professional

your child. After all, obsessive-compulsive disorder sounds ominous, if not 
overwhelming. But take heart — all is not lost. Lots of famous, highly suc-
cessful people have struggled with this problem.
 
If your child has been diagnosed with OCD, search the Internet together for

OCD is not only common, but doesn’t need to stand in the way of a successful

In this chapter, we first explain how important it is to separate the way you 
view your child from the way you view your child’s disorder. Then we tell 
you how to negotiate your relationship with your child, and we explain your 
role in therapy. We also give important tips on the delicate dance between 
providing needed help versus attempting to rescue a child with OCD, how-
ever well-intended those misguided attempts may be.
Separating Who Your Child Is 
from the OCD
In order to prepare you for the hard work ahead to help your child emerge 
from OCD, it’s important first to understand the difference between OCD and 
your child — they are not one and the same.

If your child has the measles, you can see the outbreak on his body. Any 
irritability and bad behavior are easily understood to be a reaction to how 
uncomfortable he feels. You can get specific medical help and medicines to 
treat the measles and ease your child’s discomfort. When the disease is gone, 
so is the outbreak, and your child’s behavior returns to normal. Through the 
entire ordeal, you are able to clearly distinguish between what the disease is 
doing to your child and who your child is as a person.
OCD is expressed not only through the behavior of your child, which you can 
see, but also through his thoughts, which you can’t. Unlike a disease such as 
the measles or the mumps, OCD is more personal and intimate, meaning that 
it impacts and is expressed through the personality of the child. Yet, OCD 
should not define the personality of your child.
Take the measles again, for example. In some ways, OCD is like the measles. 
Although OCD is not usually caused directly by a virus, a mixture of biologi-
cal factors does contribute to its development (see Chapter 4). Just as with 
the measles, your child clearly did not ask for or desire to have OCD.
Yet, when OCD afflicts your child, it can seem as though your child is choos-
ing to intentionally act in childish, oppositional, and defiant ways such as:
 
 Displaying new, hard-to-explain fears
 
 Refusing to get out of the shower
 
 Having difficulty getting ready on time
 
 Taking forever to do homework
 
 Insisting on elaborate mealtime rituals
On the surface, these behaviors seem easy enough to change, and for many 
kids without OCD, they are. If your child has OCD, however, demanding 
immediate cessation of these symptoms is like insisting your child cure him-
self of the measles — now! Change is possible, but much more challenging. 
The good news is that a child with OCD who works hard has a good chance of 
substantial, if not virtually complete, recovery.
Think of it this way: Say your child was in an accident that broke his legs. 
You were told that recovery was possible, but that he might not be able to 
walk or do much of anything for weeks. Surgery was required to reset the 
bones and treat other injuries. Then he needed months of physical therapy 
to fully regain the use of his legs. He worked hard with the physical therapist 
and today finally walks with only a barely discernible limp. You certainly 
wouldn’t blame him for the accident or for his residual limp. And you’d be 
darn proud of him for how brave he was during the long, sometimes painful 
recovery process.

 Chapter 21: Helping Your Child Overcome OCD
Your child’s OCD is no more under his control than being injured in an acci-
dent would be. The expressions of OCD that you see are not who your child 
truly is, just as injuries are not. With time and treatment, your child can 
emerge from the OCD, like the proverbial butterfly from the cocoon, to be the 
healthy person he really is deep down inside. That’s the child you need to 
keep your eye on as you both work through his treatment.
 
If your child receives a diagnosis of OCD from a mental-health professional, 
it’s important to understand that the OCD is not easily controlled by your 
child. It’s not your fault or your child’s fault. Blame and anger only make 
things worse.
Helping Your Child and Working 
with the Therapist
If you read this book carefully, you will have a good understanding of OCD 
and the treatment options that are available for it. You may think you have 
everything you need to treat your child on your own, but we don’t recom-
mend this. Certainly, you play an important role in your child’s recovery, 
but we suggest you enlist the help of an experienced, professional therapist 
as well. Together, you and your child’s therapist can be more effective than 
either of you working alone. In this section, we explain the advantages of 
enlisting a therapist’s help and discuss your role in the recovery process. We 
explain the pitfalls to avoid when helping your child — falling into them is 
easy if you don’t know what to look out for. Then we suggest some ways to 
boost your child’s chances of a very successful outcome.
Note: We base our advice on the assumption that your child is receiving 
Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) that includes exposure and response 
prevention (ERP). Refer to Chapters 8 and 10 for more information on these 
forms of therapy.
Parenting differently and 
not being the therapist
 
Although some self-help books seem to suggest that parents serving as their 
children’s therapists can work, we strongly advise against this. We’ve seen 
very few parents who can deal with the emotional complexities and subtleties 
of attempting to serve as their own child’s therapist. Simply put, parents love 
their children far too much to be able to have the necessary objectivity for 
planning and delivering treatment.

300
Par t V: Assisting Others with OCD 
As a parent or caregiver of a child with OCD, you know your child more 
deeply, and under all sorts of circumstances, far better than a therapist 
who may only see your child a few dozen times. You want help, and when it 
comes to your child, you ultimately know what’s best. But you may not know 
how to get there.
That’s because you probably aren’t an expert in treating OCD. Furthermore, 
the treatment of OCD does not always seem to make sense. So it’s no wonder 
many parents feel uncomfortable when a therapist guides their children through 
exercises like sifting through garbage, walking on cracks, changing up bedtime 
routines, or wearing different colored socks. Sometimes, children find these 
tasks frightening and turn to their parents to help. How can anyone expect a 
parent to turn away from a child who is crying and in obvious distress?
Thus, you very well may feel tempted to argue with your child’s therapist 
by suggesting that your child isn’t ready or “just can’t take it.” Or you may 
undermine the therapist by comforting and reassuring your child every step 
of the way. These are natural parental instincts at work. And you must work 
hard to avoid these pitfalls. A few guidelines follow:
 
 Avoid overprotection. You have to keep your protective instincts in 
check. After thoroughly checking out your therapist (see Chapter 7 for 
how to do this), trust that the therapist knows how to treat OCD and 
trust that your child will be strong enough to gradually stand up and 
talk back to OCD. As your child progresses, the fear and anxiety will 
decrease.
 
 Avoid impatience. Positive results from treating OCD do not occur 
instantaneously. With children, the therapist may need a little more 
time to build up trust. And a few sessions of supportive therapy may be 
required to establish rapport before the real work begins.
 
 Avoid rescue. Parents feel sorry for their children with OCD; that’s per-
fectly understandable. And, in fact, kids with OCD may need a little more 
help and structure at home and at school. However, it is not a good 
idea to rescue your child from activities such as cleaning up messy art 
projects, completing assignments on time, or doing chores around the 
house. Work with a therapist to develop reasonable expectations and 
then stick with them. Mastering the art of “not rescuing” is likely to take 
some practice.
 
Do your homework and make sure you pick a good therapist who is experi-
enced in CBT, and then let the therapist take charge of the treatment.
 
If, even after checking your child’s therapist out carefully, you develop alarm-
ing concerns about the therapy, get a second professional opinion before inter-
fering with the therapy. If you feel it’s necessary, you can put the therapy on 
temporary hold while getting that additional opinion.

301
 Chapter 21: Helping Your Child Overcome OCD
Managing your emotions
Parenting any child is a difficult job. Parenting a child with OCD can be 
extremely hard. You don’t always know what your child is thinking, and OCD 
behaviors can be frustrating, irritating, and annoying. At times you no doubt 
feel sorry for your child and cave in to demands — unfortunately, that only 
makes OCD worse.
Managing your own emotions will certainly help your child battle OCD. We 
suggest taking some deep breaths and calming down when you get upset. 
Here are a couple of the common feelings that parents of children with OCD 
experience and some ideas about what to do with them:
 
 Anger: Parents can get frustrated or angry because a child with OCD 
interferes with family life. There may be battles about getting ready to 
go somewhere, eating, or sleeping. Kids with OCD may demand certain 
foods, ask their parents to engage in rituals or special cleaning tasks, 
and have meltdowns for no reason. It is easy to see how even the most 
patient parent can get irritable. Another source of frustration for parents 
comes when their kids seem able to control aspects of their OCD for a 
while and then suddenly can’t. Anger makes the whole situation worse. 
Try to understand, and get help from your child’s therapist on how to 
handle these times. Reminding yourself that the OCD — rather than your 
child — is at work here may help.
 
 Embarrassment: Kids with OCD can look strange to other people. 
Imagine a child who starts to scream because a stranger accidentally 
bumps into him. Or a case where an unexpected sneeze triggers a frantic 
rush to a public restroom and elaborate cleansing rituals to decontami-
nate. Kids with OCD may have peculiar, inexplicable rituals that must be 
performed in order to go through doorways. Some children with OCD 
refuse to sit in car seats, can’t climb certain stairs, refuse to dress for 
gym class, or spend hours mumbling to themselves. The public acting 
out of obsessions or compulsions can be quite difficult for a parent to 
handle or understand. Acceptance comes with education about the dis-
order. Again, reminding yourself that these behaviors are about OCD — 
and are not a reflection on you as a parent — can help.
Working with the therapist
How a therapist structures therapy with your child depends on many factors, 
such as your child’s age, maturity, conversational skills, shyness, and inde-
pendence. Some therapists have both parents and child together in the office 
throughout each session. Other therapists break the session up, having the 
child come in first and following with a summary for the parents. Teenagers 
are usually seen alone, with parents attending sessions only occasionally.

302
Par t V: Assisting Others with OCD 
The bottom line is that therapy is built on a collaborative, confidential relation-
ship between the client (child) and the therapist. The child must be comfort-
able confiding anything to the therapist. In general, parents need to know what 
is going on and what progress is being made, but it’s counterproductive in 
most cases for them to be privy to all the details. Don’t worry that your child 
may be talking about family embarrassments (such as the last fight you had 
with your spouse). Good therapists are not judgmental and keep information 
confidential. Furthermore, most therapists don’t believe everything they hear.
 
When your child leaves the therapist’s office, ask an open-ended question like, 
“How do you feel today?” rather than “What did you talk about?” Don’t press 
your child for details about the therapy.
Collaborating on goals
Parents need to collaborate with their child and their child’s therapist in set-
ting appropriate goals. OCD is a formidable foe and is best tackled in small, 
sequential steps. Everyone needs to know what those steps will be and when 
they are going to occur. In most cases, some kind of exposure staircase (see 
Chapter 10) will be developed and times set aside for climbing each stair.
Parents can help the therapist by recording their kid’s progress. They should 
also make note of any setbacks and/or distressing, unanticipated resistance 
shown by their child during this work. Furthermore, parents can usually be 
good historians and inform therapists about their child’s early symptoms and 
how those have waxed and waned over the years.
Providing appropriate incentives
Everyone, including adults, feels more motivated to keep working on tasks 
when they can perceive some sort of payoff or incentive for all their hard 
work. For adults and even some mature teenagers, that payoff may be some-
thing intangible, such as taking pride in a job well done. Younger children 
often need more concrete, clearer rewards, such as special outings, a later 
bedtime, praise, money, stickers, or other treats. Most therapists who work 
with children have an array of interesting ideas for incentives that may work 
with your child.
 
Much as rewards may be useful in keeping your child on track, watch out for 
these pitfalls when designing your child’s incentive plan:
 
 Don’t overemphasize rewards and become excessively enthusiastic 
about each and every small gain. Kids sometimes learn to resist the 
pressure they feel when parents get too excited or push too hard — 
even with incentives.
 
 Rewards must not be the centerpiece of your child’s OCD treatment plan. 
They are only a way to nudge along and encourage good, solid effort.
 
 Part of your reward plan needs to include ignoring lack of progress, 
off-task behavior, and even OCD backslides. Let the therapist deal with 

303
 Chapter 21: Helping Your Child Overcome OCD
these issues. You will become too emotionally entangled if you get 
involved with telling your child to stop OCD behaviors.
 
 The younger your child, the more quickly you need to provide small 
rewards for specific efforts. Older children can be expected to work longer 
to obtain larger, less frequent rewards. Again, your child’s therapist can 
provide a lot of guidance here.
 
Properly-designed reward plans are not bribes. Bribery is involved when parents 
dangle rewards and incentives in front of their kids with constant reminders and 
cajoling to obtain them. You don’t want to remind your child about the reward 
plan very often at all.
Giving appropriate reassurance
A very common practice among children and adults with OCD is asking other 
people for reassurance. These questions are often repeated dozens of times 
every day. Examples of the type of questions asked include:
 
 Are the doors locked?
 
 Are you and daddy mad?
 
 Are you okay?
 
 Do I look sick?
 
 Do you still love me?
 
 Do you think a storm is coming?
 
 Do you think I hurt somebody?
 
 Is that dish really clean?
We recommend that you collaborate with your child’s therapist in developing 
an automatic response to each of these questions. Also, tell your child ahead 
of time what the answer will be. Possible examples of such responses that 
avoid the reassurance trap include:
 
 I understand that you’re worried, but I can’t answer that.
 
 That’s your OCD talking, what can you say back to it?
 
 You have to find the answer for that yourself.
 
 You know I can’t answer that.
 
 You know the answer to that.
Perhaps these answers sound like they lack empathy and compassion to you. 
However, providing reassurance to an OCD child who asks for it only fuels 
OCD. Letting your child know that you understand his or her feelings is fine, 
but giving reassurance only ends up reinforcing your child’s OCD.

304
Par t V: Assisting Others with OCD 
 
Telling your child in advance what your responses will be helps reduce frus-
tration on everyone’s part and allows you as a parent to feel less guilt about 
not providing the reassurance that’s been requested. Remind yourself of the 
old adage that sometimes you have to be just a little “cruel to be kind.”
Acting as a coach and a cheerleader
We discourage parents from being therapists to their children with OCD. But 
in reality, parents are obviously involved and must take on some role. After 
all, parents spend many hours a day with their children. We like parents to 
act as coaches. Not as mean coaches who scream, discourage, and push, nor 
as coaches who overly praise and cajole. Rather, we suggest that parents be 
kind coaches who motivate through noticing progress and keeping a posi-
tive focus, while setting reasonable limits on OCD. Table 21-1 provides some 
ideas on what coaches should and shouldn’t say.

 Chapter 21: Helping Your Child Overcome OCD
As you can see in Table 21-1, bad coaches and good coaches behave differ-
ently. Bad coaches criticize, whereas good coaches refrain from criticism. 
Bad coaches go over the top with praise, cajoling, and reminders about 
incentives. Other times, they let their anger go out of control.
Good coaches praise with restraint and don’t focus too much on rewards. 
Good coaches are leaders and role models for emotional control. They also 
set reasonable limits on their kids and their kids’ OCD. Finally, they express 
positive expectations, but without undue pressure. Your child’s therapist can 
help you figure out how to do all of that because it isn’t always easy!
Explaining OCD to Family, 
Friends, and Schoolmates
Children with OCD work desperately hard to keep people from knowing 
about their problem. Only rarely do they fully succeed. And when others 
do see their OCD behaviors, they often fail to understand what’s going on. 
All too often the net result is that the child with OCD experiences a lack of 
understanding, teasing, and social rejection. Feeling ostracized can lead to 
depression, anxiety, and failures in school.
So the questions become whom to tell, what to tell, and how to tell others 
about OCD. Unfortunately, there are no hard and fast rules. However, con-
sider the following points:
 
 Brothers and sisters: There’s no way that brothers and sisters living 
in the same household won’t at some time and in some way know that 
their sibling has OCD, or at least some pretty odd behaviors. Sometimes 
brothers and sisters feel angry because they fear what others will think 
of them for having a sibling with OCD. They may also feel angry or jealous 
about the attention paid to the OCD or the fact that their sibling seems 
to get away with behaviors that they can’t. And other times, they worry 
about catching the OCD. Acknowledging all of these feelings is important, 
yet limits must be set on how anger and jealousy get expressed.
 
 Explaining what OCD is all about is equally important. First, tell siblings 
of the child with OCD that OCD is no one’s fault. Explain that the brain of 
the child with OCD misfires for various reasons. Further note that OCD 
is treatable, nothing to feel ashamed about, and that you can’t “catch” 
OCD from someone else. Finally, try to spend a little special time with 
the siblings who don’t suffer from OCD.

306
Par t V: Assisting Others with OCD 
 
 Relatives and close family friends: Many people do not understand 
OCD very well. If your friends and family really want to be helpful, sug-
gest that they educate themselves about OCD — reading this book is 
one way they could do that. However, if they don’t want to spend that 
much time, you can at least explain a few things. Tell them the same 
things that siblings need to know: OCD involves a misfiring of the brain, 
it’s usually very treatable, and it’s not contagious. If relatives or close 
friends are directly involved with child care, you probably want to 
explain how treatment works in more detail so they don’t inadvertently 
get in the way of what you’re trying to do. If they show interest in help-
ing, you may suggest that they read Chapter 22.
 
 Schoolmates: First, check with your child, your child’s teacher, and the 
school counselor to see whether schoolmates are causing any problems, 
such as teasing or bullying due to your child’s OCD. Some children have 
OCD and don’t show much of it overtly at school. In that case, leave it alone. 
However, if problems do crop up, they can be handled a couple of ways:
 
• The school counselor may either give a talk about OCD to your 
child’s class or recruit an expert to do so.
 
• If an individual child is causing problems with bullying and teasing, 
the counselor can probably deal with that.
 
 Your child’s therapist can collaborate with the counselor as well. What’s 
important is to protect your child from becoming victimized.
 
OCD can easily affect your child’s relationship with siblings, friends, and rela-
tives. Help your child realize that any teasing or rejection is really about a 
misunderstanding of OCD, not about your child. Work with your child to fight 
back against the OCD.
 
In a few cases, OCD interferes significantly with learning and achievement 
in school. Usually, accommodations can be made for a while in the regular 
classroom. These accommodations may include providing a little extra time 
to complete tests or written work, seating the child near the front of the class 
to help with focus, and allowing extra breaks to check in with the counselor. 
If those accommodations are not sufficient and the child lags behind, a multi-
disciplinary evaluation can be requested. Your child’s therapist will no doubt 
want to be consulted on all of these accommodations and will help the school 
team provide needed help without inadvertently reinforcing the OCD.

In This Chapter
 Knowing about OCD in order to help

T
ackling OCD takes a team, and every team needs a coach — often more 
than one. If you’re interested in helping a friend or family member over-
come OCD, understand that it is not an opponent for the faint of heart or a 
single individual, no matter how brave. That’s why we don’t advocate a pure 
self-help approach in this book. It’s not that people can’t help themselves, 
but maintaining the focus, drive, and objectivity required to tackle OCD is 
easier and more effectively done with the help of others. For most OCD suf-
ferers, that help includes one or more mental-health professionals as well as 
possibly friends or family. For a few, that help may come only from friends or 
family members who can serve as “coaches.”
In this chapter, we tell you what you need to know if you’re interested in help-
ing a friend, loved one, child, or relative who suffers from OCD. We explain the 
task that lies ahead for you, including figuring out whether you’re the right 
person to do the job and knowing what to look out for. We help you assess 
your coaching capabilities as well as offer techniques for effective coaching.
Discerning What It Takes to Be a Coach
One of the trendier terms in mental health, business, personal development, 
and physical fitness circles nowadays is “coach.” When you think of the word 
“coach,” you think of someone who listens, watches, provides feedback, 

308
Par t V: Assisting Others with OCD 
models behavior, and instructs. That’s a good analogy for the role that a 
friend or family member may play in helping someone with OCD. But there 
are two important points we want to clarify before we get into the nitty-gritty 
of coaching:
 
 You don’t have to be a professional to be a coach. You don’t need any 
sort of professional degree or license. Family and friends who agree to 
serve as coaches may be of great value in helping someone implement a 
game plan for fighting OCD.
 
 Your role is to help implement — not develop — a treatment plan. 
Unless those acting as coaches are trained and licensed mental-health 
professionals, they should not be responsible for developing an actual 
treatment plan for OCD. What we’re discussing in this chapter is helping 
your friend or family member carry out a treatment plan that has been 
developed in cooperation with a therapist.
To be an effective coach, you need to understand the game that’s being 
played. In this case, that means you need to become educated about OCD. Of 
course, we recommend reading this book — it really does provide a whole lot 
of information about OCD. It’s also a good idea to find out about the specific 
type of OCD the person you’re helping has. (See Chapter 2 as well as relevant 
chapters on specific types of OCD.)
Whatever type of OCD the person you care about has, your coaching will 
likely focus on helping that person to implement exposure and response pre-
vention (ERP). We explain ERP fully in Chapter 10, and that chapter should be 
read carefully. There, you not only see what ERP is, but we also provide lots 
of examples, as well as advice on troubleshooting.
In brief, ERP involves guiding someone through a series of steps that all 
involve triggers for the OCD. The steps start out fairly easy and become 
sequentially more difficult. Although to a layperson some of the steps may 
look silly or easy, trust us — OCD can make them appear like Mt. Everest.
People with OCD must climb each step, one at a time. It’s most helpful if they 
stay on that step until their distress levels (what we call Ugh Factor Ratings) 
come down a little. For example, imagine you’re helping your friend Pete with 
Contamination OCD. Pete fears shaking hands and feels compelled to wash 
his hands for an hour if he happens to be forced into a handshaking encoun-
ter. The first step on the staircase may involve Pete agreeing to briefly shake 
hands with someone who has just washed up. Pete’s next step may call for 
him to not wash his hands for one full hour. Your role as coach is to assist in 
that process — read on to discover how to do that right.

309
 Chapter 22: Helping Family and Friends Overcome OCD with Coaching
Understanding how OCD challenges you
Good coaches know which side they’re on. If you’re coaching a friend or 
relative with OCD, you take the side of that person and you work against the 
OCD. Sounds pretty obvious, doesn’t it?
But sometimes OCD makes people act in ways that hook you into working 
against them. That happens when OCD hijacks someone’s mind so much that 
the person fears and resists treatment of the OCD (see Chapter 6 for exam-
ples of such resistance).
Naturally, as a coach and helper, you want to see the person fight OCD with 
unbridled zeal and enthusiasm. Your intense desire to help may cause you 
to push, pressure, and prod your friend to increase effort and fight harder. If 
you see signs of hesitation or reluctance, you may want to confront, cajole, 
and conquer your friend’s reluctance. That’s a good idea, right?
Actually, it isn’t. Psychologists now know that confronting and pressur-
ing people to change typically causes them to dig in their heels and resist 
changing all the more. They may run from such “help” and avoid treatment 
entirely. Thus, if you push too hard, you actually end up serving your friend’s 
OCD mind, not your friend.
Coaches don’t coach people who don’t want to be coached. They wait for 
people to seek their services. If resistance pops up, it’s important to accept 
that position. Tell your friend or relative that you’re ready to help when he or 
she wants it — not one minute before that.
 
The more you can accept people for who and where they are now, the more 
likely they are to accept the idea of making changes.
Assessing whether you’re 
the right person to coach
Not everyone is born to coach. You may care about your friend or relative a great 
deal; yet, you may not be the right person to help implement OCD treatment. 
So how do you know if you’d be a good coach? Here are a few considerations:
 
 Compassion: You have to realize that OCD is a disorder that’s not 
caused by weakness of character or malicious intentions. The person 
with OCD truly suffers and needs your empathic support (but not so 
much that you assuage and reassure).

310
Par t V: Assisting Others with OCD 
 
 Humor: It really helps if you can laugh with the person you’re coaching. 
Obviously, you don’t want to laugh at the person you’re coaching but 
rather at some of the humorous moments that pop up. Some exposure 
tasks can get a little silly, and it’s okay to laugh so long as you’re laughing 
together.
 
 Temperament: ERP requires great patience. Those with OCD can also 
test your mettle. If you’re easily frustrated or have a short fuse, you 
probably ought to cheer from the sidelines rather than coach on the 
playing field.
 
 Time: Coaching takes some time. Depending on the case, ERP may con-
sume a few hours each week for quite a few weeks or as much as a full day 
or two each week over a shorter time period. Sometimes ERP is scheduled 
to occur on a daily basis. Be clear about how much time is being asked of 
you and be certain you can commit without feeling resentful.
 
Think about how you and your life fit into the role of a coach. Don’t volunteer 
if you aren’t pretty sure you can follow through. It’s okay to be a supportive 
bystander.
Knowing your limits
Until a few decades ago, OCD was thought to be a largely untreatable con-
dition. Even today, sometimes OCD comes in a highly treatment-resistant 
mode. Although the odds are good that treatment will help, it can be difficult 
and require a lot of time and energy.
Don’t take responsibility for the success or failure of the treatment plan. If 
you feel too personally involved, you may need to back off. You are facilitat-
ing, not taking over.
Know your own limits. If your frustration runs too high, it’s time to walk 
away. You can still care and even cheerlead a little from the sidelines.
Applying Appropriate 
Coaching Techniques
If you choose to be a coach, you may become part of a team that includes 
your friend or relative, probably a mental-health professional, and perhaps 
other coaches. All of you will likely meet together and collaborate on the 
game plan. Feel free to toss out a few of your own ideas, but realize that 
responsibility for designing the game plan lies with the professional and the 
one who has OCD.

311
 Chapter 22: Helping Family and Friends Overcome OCD with Coaching
If you feel uncomfortable with any aspect of the ERP plan, express that dis-
comfort. You don’t want to agree to something that doesn’t resonate with 
you. You may discover that the therapist uses some professional jargon that 
you don’t follow. If that happens, don’t hesitate to ask questions — it doesn’t 
mean you’re stupid. Sometimes professionals lapse into using shorthand that 
others shouldn’t be expected to know.
Recognizing OCD’s dirty tricks
As a coach (or supportive family member or friend), keep your eye on the 
ball. In this case, the opponent (OCD) is always trying to steal the ball. One 
way OCD tries to overtake the coach is by enticing the coach or other people 
to help perform checking or rituals or to provide reassurance. For example:
 
 A father repeatedly reassures and reasons with his daughter who has 
Superstitious OCD (see Chapter 17). He patiently explains that numbers 
have no power over events and that certain symbols and words cannot 
cause harm. He feels gratified when she feels temporarily relieved, not 
realizing how much fuel he has provided for her superstitions.
 
 A mother agrees to rewash the dishes and rerun the laundry for her son 
who has Contamination OCD (see Chapters 8, 9, & 10). The mom goes 
along because her son is so distraught if she doesn’t.
 
 A teenager has his parents praying certain prayers with him before bed. If 
they don’t do them “just so,” he demands that they repeat the prayers. The 
parents comply so that their son goes to bed without screaming at them. 
Again, a simple act of kindness does nothing but make OCD stronger.
 
 A woman worries about her appearance. She repeatedly asks her hus-
band whether she looks okay, whether her wrinkles are deeper, and 
whether he still finds her attractive. He wants her to feel better and con-
sistently reassures her that he thinks she’s beautiful. He doesn’t realize 
that he’s simply feeding his wife’s OCD.
 
 Another person may have obsessions about closing up the house after 
leaving for work. That person calls a spouse or even a neighbor to check 
again. A half-hour later, the brief relief from the reassurance fades.
 
 Someone who repeatedly checks to see that appliances are off before 
going to bed may ask a concerned family member to check one more 
time. Rather than get into a squabble, that family member gives in. 
Unfortunately, giving in does not help the person with OCD. Rather, it 
empowers OCD. Although the person with the OCD feels temporarily 
assuaged and reassured, OCD doubts quickly return and grow stronger 
than ever.

Par t V: Assisting Others with OCD 
Coaches must refrain from helping the person actually carry out checking or 
rituals. They also need to avoid reasoning with the person, no matter how 
rational doing so seems. OCD doesn’t go away with reasoning; rather, it deep-
ens. With permission from the person with OCD, coaches can also inform 
therapists about other friends or family members who are unwittingly feed-
ing the OCD. The therapist can help design strategies to help everyone stop 
this vicious cycle.
Coaching with kindness
You’ve seen sports movies that portray really mean, arrogant coaches — 
sometimes they succeed and pull off miracles. But OCD coaching doesn’t 
work with anything other than a kind, supportive approach. We discuss how 
to coach with kindness in the following sections.
Refraining from criticizing
ERP involves hard work. Some of the steps provoke a lot of distress and 
anxiety. The last thing people with OCD need to hear is that they aren’t doing 
things right.
We’re not suggesting that you can’t provide a little corrective feedback, 
but any such messages must be worded carefully and gently. For example, 
instead of saying, “You didn’t wait the full 30 minutes before washing,” you 
could say, “You made it 20 minutes, that’s good. The step calls for 30 min-
utes, and I’ll bet you can get there next time.”
 
Most people with OCD are quite intelligent, and they didn’t ask to have OCD. 
The person you’re coaching is probably working hard to get to a better place. 
Criticism undermines confidence.
Providing encouragement
It’s not only okay, but also useful to express belief in your friend’s or rela-
tive’s ability to tackle OCD. A small dose of persuasion can do wonders too, 
but only if it is used very judiciously. You want to encourage and help the 
person to maintain a focus on each goal. But if you let your encouragement 
turn into pressure, it can be like trying to take a mountainous hairpin curve 
at high speed — you can easily fly off the edge of the road.
Leaving decision-making alone
People with OCD frequently ask for advice on what to do, when to do it, and 
how to do it — it’s actually part of their OCD. If you’re the coach, don’t fall 
for this one. You want to keep firmly in your mind that part of good OCD 
treatment is to keep decision-making in the hands of the person with OCD.

313
 Chapter 22: Helping Family and Friends Overcome OCD with Coaching
For example, a woman with Shaming OCD may worry that she’ll shout 
obscenities in public, or even worse, at church. Her exposure task is to go to 
a movie while actively focusing on and thinking about obscenities. She may 
ask you whether she should leave the movie if her anxiety becomes too great. 
Don’t make that decision for her. It’s okay to tell her that the general princi-
ple is to stay with an exposure step until distress comes down some, but how 
long she actually does so is always completely her decision to make.
Eliminating surprises by asking for permission
As a coach, keep in mind that treatment should be predictable and under the 
control of the person with OCD. Thus, if an exposure step calls for your friend 
to smear motor oil on her arm, you don’t want to surprise her by unexpectedly 
sullying her arm with Penzoil. Rather, you should discuss the step and ideally 
allow her to do the dirty work. If she just can’t bring herself to do it and asks 
you to, then you can. Her next step can then involve doing it herself.
Furthermore, you want to be sure you’re both on the same page. Perhaps 
you’re working with someone who has Hoarding OCD (see Chapter 16). If you 
go to that person’s home, you’ll probably encounter huge stacks of useless 
junk. Useless to you, perhaps, but likely seen as invaluable by the one you’re 
coaching. The rule of thumb is: Don’t touch a thing or toss out the most triv-
ial, unusable item you’ve ever seen without explicit permission.
 
Those who have OCD don’t give up their fundamental rights when they 
undergo treatment. Coaches can be effective only when they allow the people 
they are helping to control the steps being taken.
Avoiding arguing at all costs
Being a coach is tricky business. Sometimes the person you’re coaching 
will suddenly balk and declare himself unable to take the next step. Perhaps 
you’ve actually seen him take steps that appear quite similar to the one he’s 
resisting. Under such circumstances, you may be tempted to argue and con-
vincingly demonstrate that his perspective is flawed. But whether he’s right 
or wrong doesn’t really matter.
A good coach doesn’t take the bait. A good coach simply says, “You’re ready 
when you’re ready. You tell me when that is.” Accept the position of the 
person you’re helping and even express a little empathy.
You could easily think we’re saying that you should never disagree with the 
person you’re helping, but that’s not quite true. We’re saying that you should 
avoid arguing at almost any cost. You can express disagreement if you do 

314
Par t V: Assisting Others with OCD 
so ever so gently — whether directly or with a question. Following are a few 
ways to express disagreement if you think doing so may be useful:
 
 “I hear you saying that you feel you’re at an impasse. And clearly, you’re 
only ready when you’re ready. However, I wonder whether that’s your 
OCD mind talking. What do you think?”
 
 “I know you feel rather hopeless right now. I’d feel frustrated too if I was 
in your shoes. Have you felt hopeless at other times and felt more 
hopeful later?”
 
 “You’re right; the OCD does seem to be in charge right now. However, I 
do believe in you, and I suspect you’re going to find a way to get where 
you want to be.”
 
Sometimes you word your disagreement beautifully and your friend or relative 
still manages to argue back. When that happens, it’s best to let go of the issue 
and allow the therapist to deal with it.
 
Coaches are not serving as therapists. It is not up to you as a coach to force the 
person you’re coaching to stick with the treatment plan. You can express encour-
agement and belief in the person, but arguing is always counterproductive.
Sidestepping the word “should”
Dr. Albert Ellis was a psychologist who virtually made a career out of rail-
ing against the word “should.” He aptly noted that there are few behaviors 
that people absolutely “should” or “should not” do. Obviously, many of us 
would argue that murder, stealing, and abuse belong on the “should not” do 
list. However, people have a strong proclivity to use the word “should” in an 
array of situations that really don’t call for the harsh, judgmental tone the 
word conveys.
Most of the time, other words or phrases do the job of “should” without sound-
ing so evaluative. If you plan to coach someone with OCD, we recommend that 
you start monitoring your use of the word “should.” Try substituting other 
phrases, such as, “It would be better if . . . ,” “I suspect you’d want to . . . ,” or 
“It would be nice if . . .” The bottom line is that you don’t want to tell those with 
OCD how they “should” feel, what they “should” be ready for, or what they 
“should” do. Check out the following list of some “should” statements, along 
with some improved ways of stating things:
“Should” statement: You should stay with this step for at least 30 minutes.
Improved statement: It has been 23 minutes. Just seven more to go. See if 
you can hang in there.
“Should” statement: You shouldn’t feel that way.
Improved statement: I can tell you’re feeling upset.

315
 Chapter 22: Helping Family and Friends Overcome OCD with Coaching
“Should” statement: You shouldn’t wash your hands so much. They’re 
starting to bleed!
Improved statement: I know it’s hard, but it would help if you could stick 
with the plan of reducing that hand-washing.
“Should” statement: You shouldn’t worry about numbers all the time; 
that’s really silly.
Improved statement: I suspect you don’t enjoy getting hooked by those 
number superstitions. It would be nice if you could work a little longer on 
this number repetition exercise.
 
Don’t beat yourself up for occasionally lapsing into using the word “should.” 
We’re sure you can find instances where we use it — it’s ingrained in the 
human psyche. But do try to lessen your usage and, in general, avoid being 
judgmental.
Keeping difficult emotions in check
Watching someone you care about struggle with OCD can be frustrating. OCD 
is neither logical nor rational. When you see people being irrational, you 
may want to shake some sense into them. You may feel angry, upset, or dis-
tressed.
Try to appreciate the fact that the person you’re coaching is likely to be con-
sumed with fighting OCD and doesn’t understand your turmoil. Furthermore, 
if you express your distress, things will only get worse. We suggest you read 
the earlier section in this chapter, “Knowing your limits,” if you find yourself 
overwhelmed with negative emotions.
Developing alternatives to reassurance
In the section “Recognizing OCD’s dirty tricks,” we note that reassurance, 
assuaging, and giving into OCD demands only gives the OCD part of some-
one’s mind more fuel. But how do you not reassure someone you care about 
who is in distress and begging for reassurance?
In fact, you’ll probably find yourself unable to stop giving reassurance at first. 
Most kind people are programmed to provide reassurance to those who are 
in distress and ask for it. That’s probably not a big problem for the average 
person. But OCD changes the game.
Work with the person you’re coaching and the therapist on this issue. 
Everyone needs to know that you plan to respond differently from here on 
out. We recommend designing a list of automatic responses — ones that 
you can memorize and use reflexively. Table 22-1 provides a few examples 
of reassurance requests that may be asked of you and some reassurance-
busting responses.

Contamination 
Do you think this table 
was wiped clean 
enough? 
There’s always a 
chance that germs 
remain anywhere, 
including on this table.
Checking and doubting
Do you think that bump 
we hit was a person?
Remember that your 
therapist said to say that 
it’s always possible you 
did hit someone. Beyond 
that, I don’t know.
Shaming
Will I go to hell?
I don’t know.
Checking and doubting
Are you still attracted to 
me?
You know I can’t answer 
that for you.
Shaming 
Do you think I’m gay?
I can’t answer that.
Superstitious
Do you think that hearse 
will bring us bad luck?
Probably.
 
Your list of reassurance busters needs to be planned in advance and agreed 
upon by the therapist and the person you’re coaching. These are not pulled 
out as a surprise. And they’re not intended to be sarcastic. Feel free to use 
judicious humor, but not disrespect.

 Handling flare-ups
 Counting small steps
 Remembering your OCD doesn’t define you
A
 variety of chapters in this book give you detailed, comprehensive plans 
for dealing with your OCD. But sometimes you just want to make it 
through a minute, an hour, or a day. This chapter gives you some quick tips for 
dealing with your OCD. Use these tips to ease your journey.
Breathing Better
Breathing strategies can help you manage difficult feelings. Whether your 
feelings involve fear, anxiety, sadness, or urges, concentrating on your breath 
can decrease the intensity of your distress. First, take a deep breath through 
your nose. Notice the air going into your nostrils and flowing into your lungs. 
Fill the lower part of your lungs first by expanding your abdomen and your 
diaphragm. Hold that breath for a slow count of five. Then slowly release the 
air to a slow count of eight.
Many people find that making a slight hissing noise through their lips helps 
them slow down the exhalation. Continue breathing this way for five or six 
breaths. Notice how the breathing affects your feelings. Deep, slow breathing 
is a great alternative to other ways of trying to avoid feelings through 
compulsions.

320
Par t VI: The Par t of Tens 
Considering a Delay
Especially if you’re early in the process of working on your OCD, stopping 
your compulsions may seem to border on the absurd or the impossible. That’s 
okay — just delay. In other words, put off your compulsive behavior (such as 
hand-washing, chanting, arranging things, or cleaning) for 10 or 15 minutes. 
Later, try delaying for half an hour, then an hour. Give yourself credit for each 
and every delay. Soon you’ll find yourself ready for full-blown exposure and 
response prevention (ERP — see Chapter 10).
Distracting Yourself
Although not an ideal strategy in the long run, distracting yourself during 
early ERP can help you get through the first steps. Try focusing on another 
competing activity, such as:
 
 Eating
 
 Going for a walk
 
 Knitting
 
 Reading
 
 Watching TV
After a while, we recommend that you drop your distraction strategies. But 
distraction can help get you started.
Accepting Discomfort
The OCD mind attempts to avoid discomfort of almost any kind all the time. 
The mind also labels discomfort as terrible and unacceptable. However, 
these attempts to avoid discomfort at all costs inevitably create even more 
discomfort in the long run.
Instead, open up a little room for discomfort in your life. When you feel dis-
tress, notice it and merely study it for a while, as though you were going to 
write a report about emotional upset. Remind yourself that some discomfort 
is inevitable in life. As you embrace negative feelings, you’ll find that they 
paradoxically lessen their hold on you and your life.

321
 Chapter 23: Ten Quick OCD Tricks
Counting Every Exposure
Whether your ERP task is easy or difficult, takes 20 minutes or all day, appre-
ciate the fact that every single success matters. Don’t look at the big picture. 
Instead, focus on each attempt in and of itself. If you haven’t done ERP for a 
few days, don’t beat up on yourself; instead, design one small task and 
complete it.
Realizing It’s Not You, It’s Your OCD
OCD is not the same thing as who you are. OCD takes control of your brain 
and compels you to do things you don’t like or want to do. OCD makes you 
feel that these actions are necessary, but you wouldn’t choose to do them on 
your own. So it’s important to remind yourself that you are not full of doubt, 
uncertainty, and avoidance of all risks — that’s your OCD mind talking. As 
you step back and realize that it’s just your OCD mind, you’ll gain strength, 
confidence, and resolve.
Making Flashcards
When you’re mired in the throes of an episode of OCD urges, thinking ratio-
nally and remembering what you’re supposed to do is pretty hard. Therefore, 
we recommend that you write out a few ideas on some flashcards. Consider 
the following possibilities:
 
 Bad feelings eventually pass; just give them some time.
 
 Having bad thoughts doesn’t make me a bad person.
 
 I’ve experienced this before and lived through it.
 
 The longer I delay a compulsion, the better off I’m going to be.
 
 Thoughts are just thoughts; just because I think something doesn’t make 
it true.

322
Par t VI: The Par t of Tens 
Going to an Online Support Group
As you’re working on your OCD, you’ll experience your share of both suc-
cesses and difficult times. When you feel discouraged, alone, or down, seek-
ing some support is never a bad idea. One great place you can go almost 
anytime is online. We don’t have any particular online support group to rec-
ommend to you — you need to explore and find one that feels like a good fit 
to you. Various networks online offer encouragement, education, and advice. 
Of course, they’re not a substitute for professional help, but they can support 
your efforts. Always take care in terms of revealing personal information and 
data online that can reveal your identity.
Minding Meditation
Your OCD brain is primed to set off alarms excessively and in ways that 
feel outside of your control. Meditation teaches you to take control of your 
mind and focus it willfully. The skill of meditation can be acquired by almost 
anyone. Meditation is not an all or none phenomenon, but rather a skill that 
exists along a long continuum. We recommend that you consider an adult 
continuing education class and/or read Meditation For Dummies, 2nd Edition, 
by Stephan Bodian and Dean Ornish (Wiley) or other books on this topic.
Taking a Hot Bath
OCD got you down? Feeling stressed, frazzled, and out of control? Unless you 
have contamination OCD, we recommend you try a time-tested technique: 
Take a long soak in a hot bath, perhaps with oils, scents, or bubbles added. 
For those with contamination OCD, try throwing a handful of dirt into the tub 
and call it an exposure task!

O
bsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) seriously damages the quality of 
the lives of those who suffer from it. Many people with OCD report that 
much of their day focuses on their obsessions and compulsions that involve 
cleaning, fears of contamination, checking on safety, and various superstitious 
worries and behaviors. Their OCD slams the door on more positive pursuits 
such as hobbies, recreation, charitable work, and social connections — most 
of what makes a life feel full and worthwhile.
However, the odds are high that you’ll be able to substantially reduce the 
hold that OCD has over your life. Assuming you do, you’ll have time and 
resources that you haven’t had available to you in many years. You may find 
this new freedom confusing and not know what to do with it. This chapter 
gives you ten ideas for filling up the void.
Forgiving Yourself
Most people with OCD have a tendency to berate themselves for having the 
disorder in the first place. Making matters worse, they beat themselves up 
after they’ve improved from the OCD — often believing they have wasted 
years mired in their OCD and should be punished for doing so.

324
Par t VI: The Par t of Tens
Being angry with yourself only keeps you from finding peace. Finding a way 
to forgive yourself is important. First, remember that you did not ask for your 
OCD. OCD is a complicated problem with many causes (see Chapters 4 and 5 
for more information about the causes of OCD). For many decades no effec-
tive treatments even existed for OCD — proving just how formidable a foe 
OCD can really be.
You had to work hard to battle your OCD. If you have experienced significant 
success, you deserve praise, not punishment. Therefore, when you notice 
self-punishing thoughts going through your head, try answering back with 
one of these self-forgiving phrases:
 
 I am not the same as my OCD.
 
 I didn’t ask for my OCD, but I did battle it well.
 
 I’ve made great progress; beating myself up will only make me backslide.
 
 If a friend of mine worked hard on his OCD, I’d praise him, not pummel him.
 
 It’s time to focus on future successes, not past struggles.
Searching for Meaning
Many sufferers from OCD report that they feel as though their lives have no 
meaning outside of dealing with their OCD. But again, if you experience even 
partial success in battling your OCD, the possibility for discovering new mean-
ings begins to emerge.
Think about what you want to be remembered for — it probably goes beyond 
your OCD. Do you want to be remembered for your clean house or your kind 
heart? You may find sources of meaning and ways you’d like to be remembered 
by considering the following possibilities:
 
 Advancing knowledge
 
 Being generous
 
 Being grateful
 
 Helping others who are less fortunate
 
 Improving the environment
 
 Taking care of rescue animals
 
 Teaching others
In addition, honor your personal faith. Believe in something larger than your-
self or your OCD.

325
 Chapter 24: Ten Steps to Take After You Get Better
Strengthening Family Ties
OCD has a way of creating rifts in families. Friends and relatives of those 
with OCD often become frustrated and upset because they don’t understand the 
disorder. And those who have OCD feel unfairly maligned and misunderstood.
If you’ve managed to overcome much of your OCD, it’s time to mend those 
fences. Try having a monthly potluck with all family members invited. If 
you live some distance away, try to arrange family reunions every couple of 
years. If your family is willing to listen, you may want to explain OCD to them 
or suggest that they read this book. If your family is reasonably close, they 
may consider the value of family therapy — it can help. If you don’t have a 
family, or your family is uninterested in reengaging, read the following sec-
tion on finding friends.
Finding Friends
Your OCD may have dominated so much of your time and attention that you 
weren’t able to develop good friendships. And finding friends, especially as an 
adult, can be difficult. People are busy with their jobs and immediate families.
Yet, the value of having a circle of friends is considerable. People with the 
support of friends tend to be much healthier, happier, and fulfilled. Friends 
give you a source of advice, enjoyable times, and encouragement.
Though the task may sound challenging, you can find friends if you work 
at it. Consider joining a neighborhood association and actively participating. 
Search for continuing education classes (see the section “Learning New Skills”) 
and talk with your fellow classmates during breaks or after class. You can find 
social support groups at churches, synagogues, and mosques. Participate in 
politics. Be creative; you can do this.
Reaching Out to Others with OCD
If you’ve gone through exposure and response prevention therapy (ERP, 
see Chapter 10), you could make a great coach for someone else. Look for 
OCD support groups in your area. You can find them in your local news-
paper or on the Internet (be sure to check out the OCD Foundation at www.
ocfoundation.org).

326
Par t VI: The Par t of Tens
Go to one of these support groups and tell them about your successes. You 
can also offer to coach. If someone takes you up on the offer, be sure to read 
Chapters 10 and 22 first.
 
Don’t try to serve as a therapist for someone; that’s the job of a mental-health 
professional.
Helping Others
You can help people who don’t suffer from OCD, too! The benefit of helping 
someone else is reciprocal — you feel good and so does the person you’re 
helping. The possibilities are endless, depending on what skills and interests 
you have, where you live, and what needs stand out in your community. 
Some suggestions for ways to help others include:
 
 Working with the American Cancer Society
 
 Joining Big Brothers or Big Sisters and mentoring a child
 
 Helping kids with their homework through Boys and Girls clubs
 
 Judging a school science fair
 
 Serving as a docent at a local museum
 
 Teaching English as a second language
 
 Teaching someone to read (whether a child or an adult) at your local 
community college
 
 Working with the local food bank
You can also go to www.volunteermatch.org. You enter where you live 
and your interests, and they match you up with available opportunities.
Benefiting from Exercise
OCD frequently takes up so much time that the thought of making time for 
exercise feels as likely as a cow jumping over the moon. But if you have reduced 
your OCD, you now have time available to you that you haven’t seen in years. 
Now is the time to take advantage of it, and fill what used to be consumed by 
obsessions and compulsions with something much more positive — exercise!

327
 Chapter 24: Ten Steps to Take After You Get Better
The benefits of exercise abound. They include improved health, better sleep, 
increased energy, enhanced moods, and feeling more in control of your life.
 
If you haven’t exercised regularly in quite some time, be sure to check with 
your doctor before you start an exercise regimen. Don’t keep checking over 
and over, but do get your doctor’s clearance.
Your options for exercise are numerous, but we recommend that you seek a 
mix of aerobic exercise (exercise that increases your heart rate) and anaero-
bic exercise (exercise focused on strength training). Many health clubs offer 
personal trainers who can design an individualized exercise plan. You can 
either carry out the plan on your own or, if you’re lucky enough to be able to 
afford it, have your personal trainer work with you on a regular basis.
Learning New Skills
Another great way to put new, hard-won time to use is to learn a new skill. 
New skills keep your brain sharp and enhance your sense of mastery. You 
may even find that they help you in the workplace. Either way, learning is fun.
Consider taking classes at your local community college or university depart-
ment of adult continuing education. The costs are usually reasonable. The 
choices are amazing — you can find classes on photography, writing, travel, 
dance, assertiveness, meditation, history, art, poetry, collecting (hmm, 
maybe not if you have Hoarding OCD), or bird-watching.
Pursuing Hobbies
What’s a hobby? Hobbies are activities that you enjoy and that typically are 
not all that serious. A hobby can involve almost anything at all. You can look 
into arts and crafts, scrapbooking, painting, pottery, games (such as bridge, 
scrabble, or chess), gardening, aquariums, model railroads or airplanes, 
music, or genealogy. Collections can also be hobbies, but again, let us remind 
our Hoarding OCD readers to avoid this one.
The point of pursuing hobbies is that they can provide you with considerable 
enjoyment that you haven’t experienced in quite a while. You may need to try 
a variety of hobbies in order to find one that fits you. Many hobbies are hard 
to appreciate until you take them out for a test ride.

328
Par t VI: The Par t of Tens
Finding Healthy Pleasures
Pursuing pleasures is not only enjoyable, but good for you too. Numerous 
studies have shown that including a healthy dose of pleasures in your life 
decreases chronic pain, improves overall health, decreases risk of heart 
attacks, combats stress, and increases life expectancy. What pleases you is 
a rather idiosyncratic enterprise. Of course, hobbies (see preceding section) 
may please you, but other pleasurable activities may include eating a great 
meal; going to movies; reading great books; reading less-than-great, trashy 
books; taking long walks; and playing with your dogs.
 
Ben Franklin advised us about the need for moderation in all things. So if you 
love ice cream, great — just don’t make it your main pleasurable pursuit. 
However, most people’s scales tilt toward too little pleasure — especially 
people with OCD.

Ten Dirty Little Secrets about Dirt
In This Chapter
 Digging up dirt
 Utilizing dirt
 Eating dirt
D
irt has a bad name. Those with OCD (especially the Contamination 
type) often view dirt as their arch enemy. They view each speck of dust 
with disdain and fear. But as the saying goes, you should “know your enemy.” 
Read on to find out more about dirt.
Defining Dirt
The word “dirt” (or “dirty”) generally has negative connotations. Dirt is filthy, 
squalid, obscene, corrupt, or malicious. Sometimes the term “dirt” refers to 
unseemly information about someone. Other times it is used to describe excre-
ment, unsanitary conditions, dust, and general uncleanness. Soil is also a form of 
dirt, but obviously has more positive meanings. We need soil to grow crops. Soil 
consists of humus and disintegrated bits of rock. So, dirt isn’t always a bad thing.
Living Dirt
Soil isn’t simple, bland, or inert. Soil contains an entire ecosystem in a con-
stant state of change. A square yard of soil can contain several hundred 
worms. Furthermore, bacteria, actinomycetes (disease-producing bacteria), 
fungi, micro-algae, nematodes (parasites), protozoa, and other organisms 
live, grow, and die in soil.

330
Par t VI: The Par t of Tens 
Digging Dirt
Preschoolers can spend hours digging in dirt and parents spend hours clean-
ing it up. At least a little dirt may actually help build up immune systems in 
children and protect them from getting allergies, asthma, and autoimmune 
diseases. Kids who have pets, a big family, or attend daycare in the first year 
of life are at lower risk of having allergies and asthma than kids brought up in 
pristine environments. Bet you didn’t know that.
Dirt Just Isn’t What It Used to Be
Don’t take dirt for granted. Although scientists have developed super seeds 
that can increase food production across the world, people continue to starve. 
The main reason? Poor dirt. Over the years, nutrients have been taken from 
the soil and not put back. Without good soil, improvements in agriculture do 
little to increase the food supply to poor countries.
Chimps Who Eat Dirt
Although babies and toddlers often eat dirt, parents usually try to discourage 
the practice. However, in nature, chimpanzees have been observed eating 
dirt before and after eating certain plants. Researchers have found that the 
mixture of dirt and leaves boosts the chimps’ immunity to malaria. Neither 
the dirt nor the leaves by themselves confer any anti-malaria properties.
Speaking of Washing Off Dirt
The American Society for Microbiology studied the hand-washing habits 
of 7,836 bathroom-goers in New York, Chicago, Atlanta, New Orleans, and 
San Francisco. Apparently, hand-washing is down since the previous study 
done in 1996. Less than half the men and slightly more than half the women 
observed washed their hands after using the public bathrooms. Overall, 
only 49 percent washed their hands compared to 60 percent in 1996. The 
researchers also asked people on the phone whether they washed their 
hands after using the bathroom. Of those who answered, 95 percent reported 
that indeed they do wash every time — an obvious exaggeration of the truth. 
However, we don’t have reports of widespread contagions emanating from 
our decreased hand-washing.

 Chapter 25: Ten Dirty Little Secrets about Dirt
Building with Dirt
People have used dirt as a building material for thousands of years. Clay, 
sand, and straw are mixed to form adobe bricks. Sometimes dung is even 
used instead of straw — apparently using dung repels insects. An adobe wall 
can make a surprisingly durable structure that’s fireproof and insulating. 
Adobe structures have survived earthquakes and hundreds of years of expo-
sure to the elements.
People Who Eat Dirt
Everyone consumes a little dirt — probably quite a few pounds of it over 
a lifetime. No matter how thoroughly you wash your veggies, a little dirt 
remains. However, some people actually eat dirt intentionally because, well, 
umm, they say they like it! Apparently, pregnant women are especially prone 
to this practice, which goes by the name of geophagy. Typically, they are 
most drawn to consuming clay. Why they crave clay is an open question. 
However, speculations include that dirt, and especially clay, contains vari-
ous critical minerals such as iron, magnesium, and calcium — all of which 
may be needed in greater abundance during pregnancy. Furthermore, some 
clays contain kaolin, which used to be a major ingredient in Kaopectate. 
Apparently, many white clays are thus especially good at calming episodes of 
morning sickness.
So, are we recommending that you start chowing down on dirt or clay? Well, not 
really. See the next section for some of the potential downsides to geophagy.
Kids Who Eat Dirt
Mud pie. Really. Most kids eat dirt from time to time. In fact, it’s considered 
quite normal for a toddler to ingest about 500 mg of dirt in one sitting. In case 
you haven’t been around a toddler, they pretty much stuff everything they 
find into their mouths — dirt, paper, dog food, or dust. For the most part, 
this practice is harmless. But there are some exceptions. If you live on top of 
a landfill where nuclear waste, products with lead, gasoline, pesticides, old 
batteries, spent bullets, or other toxic waste products have been discarded, 
it’s best not to let your young child eat dirt. Furthermore, if you have ani-
mals that use your garden or lawn for elimination, the dirt may contain some 
contaminates that could hurt your child. For the most part, letting little ones 
explore in a safe place, like clean sand, is a better idea.

332
Par t VI: The Par t of Tens 
Pica
A compulsion exists that causes kids to eat dirt that’s not okay, as opposed 
to “normal” dirt eating (see the preceding section). This compulsion is called 
pica. Pica is the persistent eating of things that are not food. The word pica 
comes from the Latin word for magpie, a bird that picks up and eats anything. 
In order to be diagnosed with pica, a child must eat non-food items for longer 
than a month and in a greater-than-normal quantity. In fact, the child’s eating 
habits must be really out of the ordinary. Many young children eat stuff that 
they pick up from the floor in the normal course of learning and crawling. 
To be diagnosed with dirt pica (also known as geophagy — see the section 
“People Who Eat Dirt”), a child must eat about 1 gram or more of dirt a day. 
Other substances that are ingested during bouts of pica include leaves, 
stones, paint, plaster, string, hair, insects, animal droppings, or cloth. Yum.

Appendix A
Resources for You
I
n this appendix, we provide a list of books, Web sites, and organizations 
that can give you important information about obsessive-compulsive dis-
order (OCD). We include resources for other emotional problems that often 
accompany OCD. Of course, this list cannot be a comprehensive compen-
dium of every source of help, but it’s a good start.
If you or someone you care about has OCD, information and education is 
critical to recovery. As comprehensive as this book is, we still recommend 
that you find out as much as you can about the disorder.

Appendix B
Forms to Use Against OCD
T
his appendix contains a few forms for your personal use. Feel free to 
make copies. Included are instructions on using these forms. We also 
note the chapter in which each form is first referenced in the book.
Cost/Benefit Analysis
In Chapter 6, we first suggest the value of what is called a cost/benefit 
analysis. You also see references to cost/benefit analysis in other chapters 
because it’s a versatile, powerful strategy. When you think about changing or 
making a decision, reluctance and ambivalence often creep into your mind. A 
cost/benefit analysis can clarify the issue and motivate you to move forward.
You can use a cost/benefit analysis to change a belief, make a decision, 
rethink your perspective, decide about goals, and motivate your efforts. The 
process helps you to move past contemplating changes and actually start 
moving forward. Here’s how to design a cost/benefit analysis for your issue 
or concern:
 
1. At the top of the form, write a goal, problematic thought, or decision 
that you’re pondering.
 
2. In the left-hand column, write about all the conceivable costs of 
making the changes you want to make.
 
 Write out all the downsides and negatives for making this change that 
you can think of.
 
3. In the right-hand column, write down all the potential benefits that 
your contemplated change could result in.
 
 Dare to be creative.
 
4. Under My Reflections, record conclusions, thoughts, and feelings that 
your cost/benefit analysis taught or clarified for you.
 
 You can also write out any strategies for minimizing the costs in this 
section.

My Reflections:
Monitoring Self-Handicapping
When people start out to make changes, they often find themselves self-
handicapping their efforts. See Chapter 6, where we discuss the various ways 
that people limit their efforts in order to have an excuse just in case they fail 
to make progress. These self-limitations obviously slow down improvement 
and change. Therefore, it’s important to monitor your self-handicapping and 
design reasons for stopping this oppositional behavior.
 
1. Write down the dates that you are monitoring your self-handicapping.
 
2. On the right side, indicate what behaviors or thoughts you had that 
indicated some type of self-handicapping.
 
 Although you don’t have to explicitly label your self-handicapping, you’ll 
probably find it useful to review the list of ways people engage in self-
handicapping found in Chapter 6.
 
3. Respond to your self-handicapping by talking back to that part of your 
OCD mind. Formulate a reason not to engage in that type of self-
handicapping.
 
4. After you have recorded your self-handicapping for at least a week, 
write down what you’ve learned from the exercise.

Par t VII: Appendixes 
Exposure Staircase
As first discussed in Chapter 10, you can take your OCD triggers and turn 
them into an OCD exposure staircase. Figure B-1 provides a blank staircase 
for you to fill in. Look for the item with the lowest Ugh Factor Rating and put 
it on the bottom stair. Continue to fill in the staircase with items from least 
difficult at the bottom of the staircase to most difficult at the top. Feel free to 
make extra copies as needed for your personal use.
 
Steps in your staircase should have reasonably even spacing between them in 
terms of their Ugh Factor Ratings. So if you have steps that are more than 10 
or 15 Ugh Rating points apart, try to come up with another one to fit between 
them. Try breaking a difficult item into two or three parts. For example, if the 
idea of touching the doorknob of a health clinic feels terrifying, you can try 
starting with a glove on. Then work up to touching the knob with the back of 
your hand — anything that makes it easier, so long as you keep going after 
you master the easier item.
 
Figure B-1:

exposure 
staircase.
 
Climbing and Checking Your 
ERP Progress Form
After you’ve completed filling in the steps, proceed with your staircase as 
follows:
 
1. Pick the lowest stair on your OCD staircase.

343
 Appendix B: Forms to Use Against OCD
 
 Some therapists recommend starting on a stair that has an Ugh Factor 
Rating of at least 50. You can do that, but we like the idea of starting 
slow, especially if you’re doing this on your own.
 
2. Write the label for the stair you’re working on in the “Checking Your 
ERP Progress Form.”
 
 A blank progress form follows for your use. See Chapter 10 for an example.
 
3. Step on the stair.
 
 In other words, make contact with the OCD trigger.
 
4. Record your Ugh Factor Rating when you first make contact with 
your stair.
 
 Refrain from resorting to a compulsion.
 
5. Re-rate your Ugh Factor Rating every ten minutes.
 
 This rating may increase for a while, but stay in contact with your trig-
ger anyway.
 
6. Remain in contact with your trigger until your Ugh Factor Rating 
decreases.
 
 Generally, you’ll find that takes anywhere from ten minutes up to an 
hour or so. Ideally, you want it to come down by 50 percent (or to an 
actual Ugh Factor Rating of 30 or below if your stair initially was 50 or 
above) before you move on to another step.
As you work through the preceding steps, keep the following tips in mind:
 
 Be on the lookout for subtle compulsions that you find yourself tempted 
to do in order to decrease your distress. For example, you may come up 
with a new compulsion such as wanting to count in your head or repeat-
edly say a poem or prayer.
 
 Don’t try to suppress your obsessions. On the contrary, go ahead and 
let yourself worry about contamination or whatever. Notice the thoughts, 
but don’t try to suppress them. In fact, it’s a good idea to actively imagine 
the most feared and dire outcomes you can think of actually occurring — 
such as being stricken with a horrible disease and dying a slow, torturous 
death.
 
 Sometimes you may be able to climb two, three, or more steps in a single 
exposure session. Other times, one step will feel like plenty. You may even 
need to stay with one step for several sessions. Use drops in your Ugh 
Factor Ratings as your guide — slow and steady works just fine.
 
 Conduct at least two or three exposure sessions each week — the more 
the better.
