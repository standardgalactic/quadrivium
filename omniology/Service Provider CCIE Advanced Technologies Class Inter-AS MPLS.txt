Inter--AS MPLS Overview
AS MPLS Overview
• MPLS VPNs can span multiple providers
– Geographically diverse sites
– Redundancy requirements
• Inter-AS considerations
– How much control does each SP want
• How do SPs want to exchange routing 
information?
• Label exchange required?
– LDP/TDP typically not feasible
– RSVP would require (n*(n-1)/2)
– BGP offers alternative

Typical Inter--AS MPLS Designs
AS MPLS Designs
• Back-to-Back VRF Exchange (Option 1)
– SPs use one link per VRF needed
– SP1 treats SP2 like another customer site
• PE-CE routing (really PE-PE routing)
– No label exchange, IPv4 packets only
• VPNv4 BGP Exchange (Option 2)
– Connected SP PEs peer VPNv4 BGP
– VPNv4 exchanges labels
• LSP end-to-end
• Multihop VPNv4 BGP Exchange (Option 3)
– Non-connected SP PEs peer VPNv4 BGP
– IPv4 BGP exchanges labels at SP edge
– Implies SPs must share internal routing information

Back VRF Exchange
• Pros
– SPs do not need to exchange internal routing 
information
– SPs control own VRF import & export policies
• Route distinguishers and route targets locally significant
– Simple configuration
• Treated just like any other VPN site
• Cons
– Requires PE-PE IGP protocol
– PE to PE routers must have all VRFs configured 
locally
• Must maintain VPNv4 peerings with all internal PEs
• Must maintain VRF routing tables

VPNv4 BGP Exchange
VPNv4 BGP Exchange
• Considerations
– Route-target filtering on edge by default
• no bgp default route-target filter
– LSP is end to end
• QoS considerations
• Pros
– SPs do not need to exchange IGP routes
• IPv4 BGP typically already running between border routers
• Cons
– PE to PE routers must have all VPNv4 information
• Must maintain VPNv4 peerings with all internal PEs (or with 
internal VPNv4 route reflectors)

• Considerations
– PE routers must have IGP route for remote PE routers to…
• Allow transport for VPNv4 session
• Allow building of IGP transport label
– LSP is end to end
• PE to PE routers exchange labels via IPv4 BGP
– Route reflection and next-hop processing
• Pros
– VPNv4 information only exchanged between devices with that 
VRF
– VPN PE routers need not run BGP with anyone else
• Cons
– SPs must exchange internal routing info
• Internal addressing may not be routable
• Possibly exposes core routers to Internet

Carrier Supporting Carrier (CSC)
• CSC used when one provider needs to use 
other provider as transparent transit
– Tier 2 ISP has customers in New York and LA but no 
nationwide infrastructure
– Tier 2 ISP uses Tier 1 ISP as transit between POPs
• Backbone Carrier & Customer Carrier
– Backbone carrier provides MPLS VPN service to 
customer carrier
• Customer carrier may or may not be MPLS 
enabled
– Backbone carrier only switches based on topmost 
label

CSC Considerations
CSC Considerations
• Backbone carrier runs CSC_PE –
CSC_CE IGP with customer carrier
• Customer carrier peers BGP between 
CSC_CEs
• CSC_PE and CSC_CE must exchange 
MPLS labels to build end to end LSP 
between CSC_CE and CSC_CE
