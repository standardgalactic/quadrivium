About the Authors
John Moore grew up in the foothills of Western North Carolina. He attended
the University of North Carolina at Asheville, where he received his bache-
lor’s degree in chemistry. He earned his master’s degree in chemistry from
Furman University in Greenville, South Carolina. After a stint in the United
States Army, he decided to try his hand at teaching. In 1971, he joined the
chemistry faculty of Stephen F. Austin State University in Nacogdoches,
Texas, where he still teaches chemistry. In 1985 he started back to school
part time and in 1991 received his doctorate in education from Texas A&M
University. For the last five years has been the co-editor (along with one of
his former students) of the “Chemistry for Kids” feature of The Journal of
Chemical Education. In 2003, his first book, Chemistry For Dummies, was pub-
lished, soon to be followed by Chemistry Made Simple. John enjoys cooking
and making custom knife handles from exotic woods.
Richard Langley grew up in southwestern Ohio. He attended Miami University
in Oxford, Ohio, where he received bachelor’s degrees in chemistry and miner-
alogy and then a master’s degree in chemistry. His next stop was the University
of Nebraska, where he received his doctorate in chemistry. Afterwards, he took
a postdoctoral position at Arizona State University in Tempe, Arizona, followed
by a visiting assistant professor position at the University of Wisconsin at River
Falls. In 1982, he moved to Stephen F. Austin State University. For the past sev-
eral years, he and John have been graders for the Free Response portion of the
AP Chemistry Exam. He and John have collaborated on several writing pro-
jects, including 5 Steps To A 5 on the AP: Chemistry and Chemistry for the Utterly
Confused. Rich enjoys jewelry making and science fiction.

Introduction
W
elcome to Biochemistry For Dummies!
We are certainly happy you have decided to delve into the fascinating world
of biochemistry. Biochemistry is a complex area of chemistry, but under-
standing biochemistry isn’t really complex. It takes hard work, attention to
detail, and the desire to know and to imagine. Biochemistry, like any area of
chemistry, is not a spectator sport. You must interact with the material, try
different explanations, and ask yourself why things happen the way they do. 
Work hard and you will get through your biochem course. More importantly,
you might grow to appreciate the symphony of chemical reactions that take
place within a living organism, whether it be a one-celled organism, a tree, or
a person. As each individual instrument contributes to an orchestra, each
chemical reaction is necessary, and sometimes its part is quite complex.
However, when you combine all the instruments, and each instrument func-
tions well, the result can be a wonder to behold and hear. If one or two instru-
ments are a little out of tune or aren’t being played well, the orchestra still
functions — but things are a little off. The sound isn’t quite as beautiful, or
there is a nagging sensation of something being wrong. The same is true of an
organism. If all the reactions occur correctly at the right time, the organism
functions well. If a reaction or a few reactions are off in some way, the organ-
ism may not function nearly as well. Genetic diseases, electrolyte imbalance,
and other problems may cause the organism to falter. And what happens
then? Biochemistry is often where ways of restoring the organism to health
are found.
About This Book
Biochemistry For Dummies is an overview of the material covered in a typical
college-level biochemistry course. We have made every attempt to keep the
material as current as possible, but the field is changing ever so quickly. The
basics, however, stay the same, and that is where we concentrate our efforts.
We also include information on some of the applications of biochemistry that
you read about in your everyday life, such as forensics, cloning, gene ther-
apy, genetic testing, genetically modified foods, and so on.

As you flip through this book you will see a lot of chemical structures and
reactions. Much of the biochemistry revolves around knowing the structures
of the molecules involved in biochemical reactions. If you are in a biochem-
istry course, you probably have had at least one semester of organic chem-
istry. You will recognize many of the structures, or at least the functional
groups, from your study of organic chem. You will see many of those mecha-
nisms that you loved/hated here in biochemistry.
If you bought this book just to gain general knowledge about a fascinating sub-
ject, try not to get bogged down in the details. Skim the chapters. If you find a
topic that interests you, stop and dive in. Have fun learning something new.
Conventions Used in This Book
We have organized this text in a logical progression of topics that might be
used in a biochemistry course. We have made extensive use of structures 
and reactions. While reading, try to follow along in the associated figures,
whether they be structures or reactions. The icons point out things to which
you should pay particular attention, for various reasons. If you are taking a
biochemistry course, use this rather inexpensive book to supplement that
very expensive biochemistry textbook.
Icons Used in This Book
If you have ever read other For Dummies books (such as the wonderful
Chemistry For Dummies) you will recognize the icons used in this book, 
but here are their meanings anyway:
This icon is a flag for those really important things that you shouldn’t forget
as you go deeper into the world of biochemistry.
We use this icon to alert you to a tip on the easiest or quickest way to learn a
concept. Between the two of us, we have almost 70 years of teaching experi-
ence. We’ve learned a few tricks along the way and we don’t mind sharing.
The Real World icon points out information that has direct application in the
everyday world.

The Warning icon points to a procedure or potential outcome that can be
dangerous. We call it our Don’t-Try-This-At-Home icon.
What You’re Not to Read
Don’t read what you don’t need. Concentrate on the area(s) in which you need
help. If you are interested in real-world applications of biochemistry, by all
means read those sections (indicated by the Real World icon). However, if
you just need help on the straight biochemistry, feel free to skip the applica-
tions. You don’t have a whole lot of money invested in this book, so don’t feel
obligated to read everything. When you’re done, you can put it in your book-
shelf alongside Chemistry For Dummies, The Doctor Who Error Finder, and 
A Brief History of Time as a conversation piece.
Foolish Assumptions
We assume — and we all know about the perils of assumptions — that you
are one of the following:
 A student taking a college-level biochemistry course.
 A student reviewing your biochemistry for some type of standardized
exam (the MCAT, for example).
 An individual who just wants to know something about biochemistry.
 A person who has been watching way too many forensic TV shows.
If you fall into a different category, we hope you enjoy this book anyway.
How This Book Is Organized
Here is a very brief overview of the topics we cover in the various parts of
this book. Use these descriptions and the Table of Contents to map out your
strategy of study.

Introduction

Part I: Setting the Stage: Basic
Biochemistry Concepts
This part deals with basic aspects of chemistry and biochemistry. In the first
chapter you find out about the field of biochemistry and its relationship to
other fields within chemistry and biology. You also get a lot of info about the
different types of cells and their parts. In Chapter 2 we review some aspects
of water chemistry that have direct applications to the field of biochemistry,
including pH and buffers. Finally, you end up with a one-chapter review of
organic chemistry, from functional groups to isomers.
Part II: The Meat of Biochemistry: Proteins
In this part we concentrate on proteins. You are introduced to amino acids,
the building blocks of proteins. Having the building blocks in hand, in the
next chapter we show you the basics of amino acid sequencing and the differ-
ent types of protein structure. Finally, we will finish this part with a discus-
sion of enzyme kinetics, both catalysts (speeding up reactions) and inhibitors
(slowing them down).
Part III: Carbohydrates, Lipids, 
Nucleic Acids, and More
In this part we show you a number of biochemical species. You’ll see that car-
bohydrates are far more complex than that doughnut you just ate might lead
you to believe, but we do show you some biochemistry that is just sweet!
Then we jump over to lipids and steroids. Next are nucleic acids and the
genetic code (Da Vinci, eat your heart out!) of life with DNA and RNA. Then
it’s on to vitamins (they are involved more than once a day) and hormones
(no humor here — it would be just too easy).
Part IV: Bioenergetics and Pathways
It all comes down to energy, one way or another. In these chapters we look at
energy requirement and where that energy goes. This is where you meet our
friend ATP and battle the formidable Citric Acid Cycle. Finally, since you will
be hot and sweaty anyway, we throw you into the really smelly bog of nitro-
gen chemistry.

Biochemistry For Dummies 

Part V: Genetics: Why 
We Are What We Are
In this part we tell you all about making more DNA, the processes of replica-
tion, and several of the applications related to DNA sequencing. Then it’s off
to RNA and protein synthesis. We also spend some time talking about the
Human Genome Project.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
In this final part of the book we discuss ten great applications of biochemistry
to the everyday world and reveal ten not-so-typical biochemical careers.
Where to Go from Here
The answer to this question really depends of your prior knowledge and goals.
As with all For Dummies books, this one attempts to make all the chapters
independent, so that you can pick a chapter containing material you are
having difficulty with and get after it, without having to have read other 
chapters first. If you feel comfortable with the topics covered in general and
organic chemistry, feel free to skip Part I. If you want a general overview of
biochemistry, skim the remainder of the book. Dive deeper into the gene pool
when you find a topic that interests you.
And for all of you, no matter who you are or why you are reading this book, we
hope that you have fun reading it and that it helps you to learn biochemistry.

f you are enrolled in a biochemistry course, you may want to skip this
chapter and go right to the chapter(s) where we discuss the material you
are having trouble with. But if you are thinking about taking a course in bio-
chemistry or just want to explore an area that you know little about, keep
reading. This chapter gives you basic information about cell types and the
parts of the cell — which are extremely important in biochemistry.
Sometimes it’s easy to get lost in the technical stuff and forget about the big
picture. This chapter sets the stage for the details.
Why Biochemistry?
We suppose the flippant answer would be “Why not?” or “Because it is
required.”
That first response is not too bad an answer, actually. Look around. See all
the living or once living things around you? The processes that allow them 
to grow, multiply, age, and die are all biochemical in nature. Sometimes we sit
back and marvel at the complexity of life, the myriad of chemical reactions
that are taking place right now within our own bodies, how all these biochem-
ical reactions are working together so that we can sit and contemplate them.
When John learned about the minor structural difference between starch and
cellulose he remembers thinking: “Just that little difference in the one linkage

between those units is basically the difference between a potato and a tree?”
It made him want to learn more, to delve into the complexity of the chemistry
of living things, to try to understand. We encourage you to step back from the
details occasionally and marvel at the complexity and beauty of life.
What Is Biochemistry and 
Where Does It Take Place?
Biochemistry is the chemistry of living organisms. Biochemists study the
chemical reactions that occur at the molecular level of organisms. Normally 
it is listed as a separate field of chemistry. However, in some schools it is part
of biology, and in others it is separate from both chemistry and biology.
Biochemistry really reaches out and combines aspects of all the fields of
chemistry. Because carbon is the element of life, organic chemistry plays a
large part in biochemistry. Many times biochemists study how fast reactions
occur — that’s physical chemistry. Often metals are incorporated into bio-
chemical structures (such as iron in hemoglobin) — that’s inorganic chem-
istry. Biochemists use sophisticated instrumentation to determine amounts
and structures — that’s analytical chemistry. Biochemistry is similar to 
molecular biology; both study living systems at the molecular level, but 
biochemists concentrate on the chemical reactions that are occurring.
Biochemists may study individual electron transport within the cell, or they
may study the processes involved in digestion. If it’s alive, biochemists will
study it.
Types of Living Cells
All living organisms contain cells. A cell is a prison of sorts. The working
apparatus of the cell is imprisoned within the “bars” — known as the cell
membrane. Just as a prison inmate can still communicate with the outside
world, so can the cell contents. The prisoner must be fed, so nutrients must
be able to enter every living cell. There is a sanitary system for the elimina-
tion of waste. And, just as inmates may work to provide materials for society
outside the prison, a cell may produce materials for life outside the cell.
There are two types of cells: prokaryotes and eukaryotes. (Viruses also bear
some similarities to cells, but these are limited.) Prokaryotic cells are the
simplest type of cells. Many one-celled organisms are prokaryotes.
10
Part I: Setting the Stage: Basic Biochemistry Concepts 

The simplest way to distinguish these two types is that a prokaryotic cell 
contains no well-defined nucleus, whereas the opposite is true for a eukary-
otic cell.
Prokaryotes
Prokaryotes are mostly bacteria. Besides the lack of a nucleus, there are few
well-defined structures inside a prokaryotic cell. The prison wall has three
components: a cell wall, an outer membrane, and a plasma membrane. This
wall allows a controlled passage of material into or out of the cell. The mate-
rials necessary for proper functioning of the cell float about inside it, in 
a soup known as the cytoplasm. Figure 1-1 depicts a simplified version of a
prokaryotic cell.
Eukaryotes
Eukaryotes are animals, plants, fungi, and protists. You are a eukaryote. In
addition to having a nucleus, eukaryotic cells have a number of membrane-
enclosed components known as organelles. Eukaryotic organisms may be
either unicellular or multicellular. In general, eukaryotic cells contain much
more genetic material than prokaryotic cells.

Chapter 1: Biochemistry: What You Need to Know and Why

Animal Cells and How They Work
All animal cells (which are, as you now know, eukaryotic cells) have a number
of components, most of which are considered to be organelles. The primary
components of animal cells are listed in Table 1-1. (These components, and a
few others, are also present in plant cells.) Figure 1-2 illustrates a simplified
animal cell.

Part I: Setting the Stage: Basic Biochemistry Concepts 

The plasma membrane separates the material inside the cell from everything
outside the cell. The plasma or cytoplasm is the fluid inside the cell. It is impor-
tant for the health of the cell to prevent this fluid from leaking out. However,
necessary materials must be able to enter through the membrane, and other
materials, including waste, must be able to exit through the membrane.
Transport through the membrane may be active or passive. Active transport
requires that a price be paid for a ticket to enter (or leave) the cell. The cost
of the ticket is energy. Passive transport does not require a ticket. Passive
transport methods include diffusion, osmosis, and filtration.
Centrioles behave as the “train conductors” of the cell. They organize micro-
tubles, which help move the parts of the cell during cell division.
The cell can be thought of as a smoothly running factory. The endoplasmic
reticulum is the main part of the cell factory. There are two basic regions to
this structure, known as the rough endoplasmic reticulum and the smooth
endoplasmic reticulum. The rough endoplasmic reticulum contains ribo-
somes, and the smooth endoplasmic reticulum contains no ribosomes (more
about ribosomes and their function is coming up in this chapter). The rough
endoplasmic reticulum, through the ribosomes, is the assembly line of the
factory. The smooth endoplasmic reticulum is more like the shipping depart-
ment, which ships the products of the reactions that occur within the cell, to
the Golgi apparatus.
The Golgi apparatus serves as the postal system of the cell. It looks a bit like a
maze, and within it, materials produced by the cell are packaged in vesicles,
small membrane-enclosed sacs. The vesicles are then mailed to other
organelles or to the cell membrane for export. The cell membrane contains
“customs officers” (called channels), who allow secretion of the contents
from the cell. Secreted substances are then available for other cells or organs.
Lysosomes are the landfills of the cell. They contain digestive enzymes that
break down substances that may harm the cell (Chapter 6 has a lot more
about enzymes). The products of this digestion may then safely reenter 
the cell. Lysosomes also digest “dead” organelles. This slightly disturbing
process, called autodigestion, is really part of the cell digesting itself.
The mitochondria (singular mitochondrion) are the cell’s power plants, where
the cell produces energy. Mitochondria use food, primarily the carbohydrate
glucose, to produce energy, which comes mainly in the form of adenosine
triphosphate (ATP — to which Chapter 13 is dedicated).
13
Chapter 1: Biochemistry: What You Need to Know and Why

Each cell has a nucleus and, inside it, a nucleolus. These serve as the control
center of the cell and are the root from which all future generations originate.
A double layer known as the nuclear membrane surrounds the nucleus. Usually
the nucleus contains a mass of material called chromatin. If the cell is enter-
ing a stage leading to reproducing itself through cell division, the chromatin
separates into chromosomes.
In addition to conveying genetic information to future generations, the nucleus
produces two important molecules for the interpretation of this information.
These molecules are messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) and transfer ribonucleic
acid (tRNA). The nucleolus produces a third type of ribonucleic acid known as
ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA). (Chapter 9 is all about nucleic acids.)
Ribosomes contain protein and ribonucleic acid subunits. It is in the ribosomes
where the amino acids are assembled into proteins. Many of these proteins are
enzymes, which are part of nearly every process occurring in the organism.
(Part II of this book is devoted to amino acids, proteins, and enzymes.)
The small vacuoles, or simply vacuoles, serve a variety of functions, including
storage and transport of materials. The stored materials may be for later use
or may be waste material no longer needed by the cell.
A Brief Look at Plant Cells
Plant cells contain the same components as animal cells — plus a cell wall, a
large vacuole, and, in the case of green plants, chloroplasts. Figure 1-3 illus-
trates a typical plant cell.

Part I: Setting the Stage: Basic Biochemistry Concepts 

The cell wall is composed of cellulose. Cellulose, like starch, is a polymer of
glucose. The cell wall provides structure and rigidity.
The large vacuole serves as a warehouse for large starch molecules. Glucose,
which is produced by photosynthesis, is converted to starch, a polymer of
glucose. At some later time, this starch is available as an energy source.
(Chapter 7 talks a lot more about glucose and other carbohydrates.)
Chloroplasts, present in green plants, are specialized chemical factories. These
are the sites of photosynthesis, in which chlorophyll absorbs sunlight and
uses this energy to combine carbon dioxide and water to produce glucose
and release oxygen gas.
The green color of many plant leaves is due to the magnesium-containing
compound chlorophyll.
Now that you know a little about cells, press on and let’s do some

In This Chapter
 Understanding the roles and properties of water
 Exploring the differences between acids and bases
 Examining acid-base equilibria with the Brønsted-Lowry theory
 Controlling pH with buffers
W
ater is one of the most important substances on earth. We swim,
bathe, boat, and fish in it. It carries our waste from our homes and is
used in the generation of electrical power. We drink it in a variety of forms:
pure water, soft drinks, tea, coffee, margaritas, and so on. Water, in one form
or another, moderates the temperature of the earth and of our bodies. 
In the area of biochemistry, water is also one of the lead actors. Our bodies
are about 70 percent water. Water plays a role in the transport of material to
and from cells. And many, many aqueous solutions take part in the biochemi-
cal reactions in the body.
In this chapter, we examine the structure and properties of the water mole-
cule. We explain how water behaves as a solvent. We look at the properties of
acids and bases and the equilibria that they may undergo. Finally, we discuss
the pH scale and buffers, including the infamous Henderson-Hasselbalch
equation. Sit back, grab a glass of water, and dive in!
The Fundamentals of H2O
Water is essential to life; in fact, human beings are essentially big sacks of
water. Water accounts for 60–95 percent of our living cells, and 55 percent 
of the water in the human body is in intracellular fluids. The remaining 
45 percent (extracellular) is divided between the following:
 Plasma (8 percent)
 Interstitial and lymph (22 percent)
 Connective tissue, cartilage, and bone (15 percent)

Water also is necessary as a solvent for the multitude of biochemical reactions
that occur in the body:
 Water acts as a transport medium across membranes, carrying sub-
stances into and out of cells.
 Water helps maintain the temperature of the body.
 Water acts as a solvent (carrying dissolved chemicals) in the digestive
and waste excretion systems.
Healthy humans have an intake/loss of about two liters of water per day. The
intake is about 45 percent from liquids and 40 percent from food, with the
remainder coming from the oxidation of food. The loss is about 50 percent
from urine and 5 percent from feces, with the remainder leaving through
evaporation from the skin and lungs. A water balance must be maintained
within the body. If the loss of water significantly exceeds the intake, the body
experiences dehydration. If the water loss is significantly less than the intake,
water builds up in the body and causes edema (fluid retention in tissues).
Let’s get wet! Physical properties of water
The medium in which biological systems operate is water, and physical prop-
erties of water influence the biological systems. Therefore, it is important to
review some properties of water that you learned in general chemistry.
Water is a polar molecule
Because it’s polar, water has a tendency to “wet” substances, like grandma’s
fine dining-room table or a baby’s diaper. It’s also a bent molecule , not linear
(see Figure 2-1). The hydrogen atoms have a partially positive charge (δ+);
the oxygen atom has a partially negative charge (δ–). This charge distribution
is due to the electronegativity difference between hydrogen and oxygen atoms
(the attraction that an atom has for a bonding pair of electrons). The water
molecule in Figure 2-1 is shown in its bent shape with a bond angle of 
about 105°.
Normally, such partial charges result in an intermolecular force known as a
dipole-dipole force, in which the positive end of one molecule attracts the neg-
ative end of another molecule. The very high electronegativity of oxygen
combined with the fact that a hydrogen atom has only one electron results 
in a charge difference significantly greater than you’d normally expect. This
leads to stronger-than-expected intermolecular forces. These unexpectedly
strong intermolecular forces have a special name: hydrogen bonds.
18
Part I: Setting the Stage: Basic Biochemistry Concepts 

The term hydrogen bond doesn’t refer to an actual bond to a hydrogen atom,
but to the overall interaction of a hydrogen atom bonded to either oxygen,
nitrogen, or fluorine atoms with an oxygen, nitrogen or fluorine on another
molecule (intermolecular) or the same molecule (intramolecular). Hence the
term intermolecular force. (Note that although hydrogen bonds occur when
hydrogen bonds to fluorine, you don’t normally find such combinations in
biological systems.)
Water has strong intermolecular forces
Hydrogen bonds in oxygen- and nitrogen-containing molecules are very impor-
tant in biochemistry because they influence reactions between such molecules
and the structures of these biological molecules. The interaction between
water and other molecules in which there may be an opportunity for hydrogen
bonding explains such properties as solubility in water and reactions that
occur with water as a solvent.
The term hydrogen bond doesn’t refer to an actual bond to a hydrogen atom,
but to an overall interaction.
One environmentally important consequence of hydrogen bonding is that,
upon freezing, water molecules are held in a solid form that’s less dense than
the liquid form. The hydrogen bonds lock the water molecules into a crys-
talline lattice that contains large holes, which decreases the density of the
ice. The less-dense ice — whether in the form of an ice cube or an iceberg —
floats on liquid water. In nearly all other cases where a solid interacts with
water, the reverse is true: The solid sinks in the liquid. So, why is the buoy-
ancy of ice important? Ask ice fishermen! The layer of ice that forms on the
surface of cold bodies of water insulates the liquid from the cold air, protect-
ing the organisms still living under the ice.
Water has a high specific heat
Specific heat is the amount of heat required to change the temperature of a
gram of water 1° Celsius. A high specific heat means it isn’t easy to change
the temperature of water. Water also has a high heat of vaporization. Humans
can rid their bodies of a great deal of heat when their sweat evaporates from
their skin, making sweat a very effective cooling method. We’re sure you’ll
notice this cooling effect during your biochem exams.

Chapter 2: Dive In: Water Chemistry

As a result of water’s high specific heat and heat of vaporization, lakes and
oceans can absorb and release a large amount of heat without a dramatic
change in temperature. This give and take helps moderate the earth’s tem-
perature and makes it easier for an organism to control its body temperature.
Warm-blooded animals can maintain a constant temperature, and cold-blooded
animals — including lawyers and some chemistry teachers — can absorb
enough heat during the day to last them through the night.
Water’s most important biochemical 
role: The solvent
The polar nature of water means that it attracts (soaks up) other polar mate-
rials. Water is often called the universal solvent because it dissolves so many
types of substances. Many ionic substances dissolve in water, because the
negative ends of the water molecules attracts the cations (positively charged
ions) from the ionic compound (compound resulting from the reaction of a
metal with a non-metal) and the positive ends attract the anions (negatively
charged ions). Covalently bonded (resulting from the reactions between 
non-metals) polar substances, such as alcohols and sugars, also are soluble
in water because of the dipole-dipole (or hydrogen-bonding) interactions.
However, covalently bonded nonpolar substances, such as fats and oils are
not soluble in water.
Polar molecules, because of their ability to interact with water molecules, are
classified as hydrophilic (water-loving). Nonpolar molecules, which don’t
appreciably interact with (dissolve in) water, are classified as hydrophobic
(water-hating). Some molecules are amphipathic because they have both
hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions.
Figure 2-2 shows the structure of a typical amphipathic molecule. The mole-
cule appears on the left, with its hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions shown.
The alternate portion of the figure is a symbolic way of representing the mol-
ecule. The round “head” is the hydrophilic portion, and the long “tail” is the
hydrophobic portion.
Certain amphipathic molecules, such as soap molecules, can form micelles,
or very tiny droplets that surround insoluble materials. This characteristic 
is the basis of the cleaning power of soaps and detergents. The hydrophobic
portion of the molecule (a long hydrocarbon chain) dissolves in a nonpolar
substance, such as normally insoluble grease and oil, leaving the hydrophilic
portion (commonly an ionic end) out in the water. Soap or detergent breaks
up the grease or oil and keeps it in solution so it can go down the drain.
A micelle behaves as a large polar molecule (see Figure 2-3). The structure 
of a micelle is closely related to the structure of cell membranes.

Hydrogen Ion Concentration: 
Acids and Bases
In aqueous solutions — especially in biological systems — the concentration
of hydrogen ions (H+) is very important. Biological systems often take great
pains to make sure that their hydrogen ion concentration — represented as
[H+] or by the measurement of pH (the measure of acidity in a solution) —
doesn’t change.

Chapter 2: Dive In: Water Chemistry

Even minor changes in hydrogen ion concentration can have dire conse-
quences to a living organism. For example, in our blood, only a very small
range of hydrogen ion allows the body to function properly. Hydrogen ion
concentrations higher or lower than this range can cause death.
Because living organisms are so dependent on pH, let’s take a few moments
to review the concepts of acids, bases, and pH.
Achieving equilibrium
When the concentrations of hydrogen ion (H+) and hydroxide ion (OH–) are
the same, the solution is neutral. If the hydrogen ion concentration exceeds
the hydroxide ion concentration, the solution is acidic. If the hydroxide ion
concentration is greater, the solution is basic. These chemical species are
related through a chemical equilibrium.
Acidic solutions, such as lemon juice, taste sour. Basic solutions, such as
tonic water, taste bitter. (The addition of gin doesn’t change the bitter taste!)
The equilibrium of hydrogen ions is present in all aqueous solutions. It may
or may not be the major hydrogen ion source (usually it isn’t). Water is a con-
tributor to the hydrogen ion concentration because it undergoes autoioniza-
tion, as shown by the following equation:
H2O(l) H+(aq) + OH–(aq)
You often see H+(aq) represented as H3O+.
The double arrow ( ) indicates that this is an equilibrium; as such, there must
be an associated equilibrium constant (K). The equilibrium constant in the
preceding equation is Kw. The value of Kw is the product of the concentrations
of the hydrogen ion and the hydroxide ion:
Kw = [H+] [OH–] = 1.0 × 10–14 (at 25°C)
The value of the constant Kw, like all Ks, is only constant if the temperature is
constant. In the human body, where T = 37°C, Kw = 2.4 × 10–14.
In pure water, at 25°C, [H+] = 1.0 × 10–7 M (1.6 × 10–7 M at 37°C). The hydroxide
ion concentration is the same as the hydrogen ion concentration, because
they are formed in equal amounts during the autoionization reaction.
M is a concentration term, the molarity. Molarity is the number of moles of
solute per liter of solution.
22
Part I: Setting the Stage: Basic Biochemistry Concepts 

Sour and bitter numbers: The pH scale
It isn’t always convenient to report hydrogen ion concentrations in an expo-
nential form, such as 1.0 × 10–7. Thankfully, you have a way of simplifying the
representation of the hydrogen ion concentration: the pH. You can calculate
the pH for any solution by using the following equation:
pH = –log [H+]
For instance, in the case of a solution with a hydrogen ion concentration of
1.0 × 10–7 M, the pH would be
pH = –log (1.0 × 10–7) = 7.0
Table 2-1 gives similar calculations for my hydrogen ion concentrations.

Chapter 2: Dive In: Water Chemistry

If a solution has a pH less than 7, it’s acidic. Solutions with a pH greater than
7 are basic. Solutions whose pH is 7 are neutral. The pH of pure water is 7. 
Be careful, though: Not every solution that has a pH of 7 is pure water! For
example, if you add table salt to water, the pH will remain at 7, but the result-
ing solution is certainly not pure water.
The pH scale is an open-ended scale, meaning you can have a pH greater than
14 or less than 0. For example, the pH of a 1.0 × 101 M solution of hydrochlo-
ric acid is –1. John loves to ask questions based on this topic to his advanced
chemistry students! The 0–14 scale is a convenient part of the pH scale for
most real-world solutions — especially ones found in biochemistry. Most bio-
logical systems have a pH near 7, although significant deviations may exist
(the pH in your stomach is close to 1).
Calculating pOH
You can calculate pOH in a similar manner to the pH calculation. That is, you
can use the equation pOH = –log [OH–]. You can calculate the hydroxide ion
concentration from the hydrogen ion concentration and the Kw (equilibrium
constant) relationship:
[OH–] = Kw ÷ [H+]
A useful shortcut to get from pH to pOH is the following relationship: pH +
pOH = 14.00 for any aqueous solution (14.00 = pKw = –log Kw = –log 1.0 × 10–14).
For example, if a solution has a [H+] = 6.2 × 10–6, its pH would be
pH = –log [H+]
pH = –log [6.2 × 10–6]
pH = 5.21
The calculation for the pOH of that solution becomes pretty simple: 
14.00 – pH = 14.00 – 5.21 = 8.79.
Now, if you have the pH or pOH, getting the corresponding [H+] or [OH–]
becomes a pretty simple task:
[H+] = 10–pH and [OH–] = 10–pOH
For example, a solution with a pH of 7.35 has a [H+] = 10–7.35 = 2.2 × 10–7.

Strong and weak: Brønsted-Lowry theory
Since the acidity (pH) of the biological medium is so very important, let’s
take a look at one of the most accepted theories concerning acids and 
bases – the Brønsted-Lowry theory. According to this theory, acids are 
proton (H+) donors, and bases are proton acceptors.
Strong and weak acids
Acids increase the hydrogen ion concentration of a solution (they lower the
pH, in other words). Some acids, known as strong acids, are very efficient at
changing hydrogen ion concentration; they essentially completely ionize in
water. Most acids — particularly biologically important acids — aren’t very
efficient at generating hydrogen ions; they only partially ionize in water.
These acids are known as weak acids.
Bases accept (react with) rather than donate hydrogen ions in solutions. Bases
decrease the hydrogen ion concentration in solutions because they react
with these ions. Strong bases, although they can accept hydrogen ions very
well, aren’t too important in biological systems. The majority of biologically
important bases are weak bases. 
The Brønsted-Lowry theory helps to explain the behavior of acids and bases
with respect to equilibrium. A Brønsted-Lowry acid is a hydrogen ion (H+)
donor, and a Brønsted-Lowry base is a hydrogen ion acceptor. Acetic acid, 
a weak acid found in vinegar, partially ionizes in solution, evidenced by the
following equation:
CH3COOH H+ + CH3COO–
The double arrow indicates that the acetic acid doesn’t completely ionize.
(For a strong acid, complete ionization would occur, and a single arrow would
be present.) The equilibrium arrow ( ) indicates that all three chemical
species are present in the solution: the acetic acid, the acetate ion, and the
hydrogen ion, along with the water solvent.
In the Brønsted-Lowry theory, you consider the acetate ion to be a base
because it can accept a hydrogen ion to become acetic acid. According to
this theory, two substances differing by only one hydrogen ion — such as
acetic acid and the acetate ion — are members of a conjugate acid-base pair.
The species with one additional hydrogen ion is the conjugate acid (CA), 
and the species with one less hydrogen ion is the conjugate base (CB). 
25
Chapter 2: Dive In: Water Chemistry

You can express the equilibrium from the acetate example, like all equilibria,
by using a mass-action expression — as long as a balance among the species
is present. This expression is also known as a reaction quotient and as an equi-
librium constant. For acetic acid, this expression is as follows:
The a subscript means that this expression represents an acid. The square
brackets refer to the molar equilibrium concentrations of the species pre-
sent. You can express the Ka as a pKa. The calculation of pKa is similar to the
calculation of pH: 
pKa = –log Ka
In terms of conjugate acids and bases, every Ka expression appears as
No variations are allowed in this equation other than the actual formulas of
the conjugate acid and base.
Like an acid, a base has a Kb value (the subscript b meaning base). A weak
base, like ammonia, is part of the following equilibrium:
NH3 + H2O OH– + NH4
+

As with a Ka expression, a Kb expression has no variations other than the
actual formulas of the conjugate acid and base.
Every conjugate acid has a Ka, and its corresponding conjugate base has a 
Kb. The Ka and the Kb of a conjugate acid-base pair are related by the Kw — 
the ionization constant for water. For a conjugate acid-base pair, KaKb = Kw = 
1.0 × 10–14. In addition, you can use the following shortcut: pKa + pKb = 14.00.
The Kb for the acetate ion, the conjugate base of acetic acid, is
CH3COO– + H2O OH– + CH3COOH
The Ka for the ammonium ion, the conjugate acid of ammonia, is
NH4
+
H+ + NH3
An acid may be capable of donating more than one hydrogen ion. A biologi-
cally important example of this type of acid is phosphoric acid (H3PO4),
which is a triprotic acid (meaning that it can donate three hydrogen ions).
This acid is capable of donating three hydrogen ions, one at a time. The equi-
libria for this acid are

Acid or base? They just can’t decide
Some substances can’t make up their minds about what they are; they can
act as either an acid or a base. Chemists classify these substances as
amphiprotic or amphoteric substances. For example, the bicarbonate ion
(HCO3
–) can act as either an acid or a base:
HCO3
– H+ + CO3
2–
HCO3
– + H2O OH– + H2CO3
Biochemically important molecules may also exhibit amphiprotic behavior.
Amino acids contain both a basic amine (–NH2) group and an acidic carboxyl
(–COOH) group. Therefore, they can act as either acids or bases. For exam-
ple, glycine (H2N–CH2–COOH) may undergo the following reactions:
H2N–CH2–COOH H+ + H2N–CH2–COO–
H2N–CH2–COOH + H2O OH– + +H3N–CH2–COOH

In fact, amino acids may undergo proton transfer from the carboxyl end to
the amine end, forming an overall neutral species that has a positive and 
negative end. Species such as these are called zwitterions:
H2N–CH2–COOH 
+H3N–CH2–COO–
Buffers and pH Control
A solution that contains the conjugate acid-base pair of any weak acid or
base is a buffer solution. A buffer solution resists changes in pH when either
an acid or a base is added. Therefore, buffers control the pH of the solution.
Buffer solutions are important in most biological systems. Many biological
processes proceed effectively only within a limited pH range. The presence 
of buffer systems keeps the pH within this limited range.
Identifying common physiological buffers
In the human body, the pH of various body fluids is important. The pH of
blood is 7.4, the pH of stomach acid is 1–2, and the pH in the intestinal tract
is 8–9. If the pH of blood is more than 0.2 pH units lower than normal, a condi-
tion known as acidosis results; a corresponding increase in pH is alkalosis.
Acidosis and alkalosis may lead to serious health problems. There are two
general causes of acidosis and of alkalosis:
 Respiratory acidosis is the result of many diseases that impair respiration.
These diseases include pneumonia, emphysema, and asthma. These dis-
eases lead to inefficient expulsion of carbon dioxide. This leads to an
increase in the concentration of the acid H2CO3.
 Metabolic acidosis is due to a decrease in the concentration of HCO3
-.
This may be the results of certain kidney diseases, uncontrolled dia-
betes, and cases of vomiting involving nonacid fluids. Poisoning by an
acid salt may also lead to metabolic acidosis.
 Respiratory alkalosis may be the result of hyperventilation, as there is
an excessive removal of carbon dioxide, which leads to a decrease in the
H2CO3 concentration. Immediate treatment may include breathing into 
a paper bag, thus increasing the carbon dioxide concentration in the
inhaled air and therefore in the blood.
 Metabolic alkalosis may result from excessive vomiting of stomach acid.
To resist these pH problems, the blood has a number of buffer systems. These
include several proteins in blood plasma and the bicarbonate buffer system.
29
Chapter 2: Dive In: Water Chemistry

The bicarbonate buffer system is the main extracellular buffer system. This
system also provides a means of eliminating carbon dioxide. The dissolution
of carbon dioxide in aqueous systems sets up the following equilibria:
CO2 + H2O H2CO3 + H+ + HCO3
-
The presence of the conjugate acid-base pair (H2CO3 and HCO3
-) means this is
a buffer system. The conjugate acid-base ratio is about 20:1 at a pH of 7.4 in
the bloodstream. This buffer system is coupled with the following equilib-
rium (nstrumental in the removal of carbon dioxide in the lungs):
CO2(blood) CO2(g)
The second ionization of phosphoric acid, Ka2, is the primary intracellular
buffer system. The pH of this conjugate acid-base pair (H2PO4
- and HPO4
2-) 
is 7.21 for a solution with equal concentrations of these two species. 
Calculating a buffer’s pH
To determine a buffer’s pH, you may use a Ka or Kb calculation, discussed pre-
viously, or the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, which gives a shortcut.
There are two forms of the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:
and
The terms in either form are the same as defined earlier. For example, sup-
pose we wanted to calculate the pH of a buffer composed of 0.15 M pyruvic
acid and 0.25 M sodium pyruvate. Looking at Table 2-2, you see that the Ka
of pyruvic acid is 3.2 × 10-3.

The pKa would be 2.50. Therefore:
The greater the values of [CA] and [CB], the greater the buffer capacity of the
solution is. The buffer capacity indicates how much acid or base may be added
to a buffer before the buffer ceases to function.

ost biologically important molecules are composed of organic com-
pounds, which means compounds of carbon. Therefore, the student of
biochemistry must have a general knowledge of organic chemistry, which is
the study of carbon compounds, in order to understand the function and
reactions of biochemical molecules. In this chapter we review the basics of
organic chemistry, including the various functional groups and isomers that
are important in the field of biochemistry.
The Role of Carbon in the Study of Life
Long ago, scientists believed that all carbon compounds were the result of
biological processes, which meant organic chemistry was synonymous 
with biochemistry under this Vital Force theory. In the mid-1800s, though,
researchers debunked that long-held notion — the synthesis of urea from
inorganic materials showed that there were other paths to the production 
of carbon compounds. Organic chemists now synthesize many important
organic chemicals without the use of living organisms; however, biosynthesis
is still an important source of many organic compounds.

Why are there so many carbon compounds? The answer lies primarily in two
reasons, both tied to carbon’s versatility in creating stable bonds:
 Carbon bonds to itself. Carbon atoms are capable of forming stable
bonds to other carbon atoms. The process of one type of atom bonding
to identical atoms is catenation. Many other elements can catenate, but
carbon is the most effective at it. There appears to be no limit to how
many carbon atoms can link together. These linkages may be in chains,
branched chains, or rings, as shown in Figure 3-1.
 Carbon bonds to other elements. Carbon is capable of forming stable
bonds to a number of other elements. These include the biochemically
important elements hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur. The latter
three elements form the foundation of most of the functional groups
(reactive groups of a molecule) necessary for life. Bonds between
carbon and hydrogen are usually unreactive under biochemical condi-
tions; thus, hydrogen often serves as an “inert” substituent.
It’s All in the Numbers: Carbon Bonds
Carbon is capable of forming four bonds. In bonding to itself and other ele-
ments, carbon uses a variety of types of hybridization — when it bonds to
another carbon molecule, for example, these may have four single bonds, 
a double and two single bonds, two double bonds, or a triple and a single
bond. Double bonds to oxygen atoms are particularly important in many 
biochemicals. Table 3-1 shows the number of bonds carbon may have with
some selected non-metals, along with the hybridization of those bonds.

Sticky Chemistry: Bond Strengths
Covalent bonds are important intramolecular forces (forces within the same
molecule) in biochemistry. Intermolecular forces (forces between chemical
species) are also extremely important. Among other things, intermolecular
forces are important to hydrophilic (water-loving) and hydrophobic (water-
hating) interactions.
Everybody has ‘em: Intermolecular forces
All intermolecular forces are van der Waals forces, that is they are not true
bonds in the sense of sharing or transferring electrons, but are weaker attrac-
tive forces. These forces include dipole-dipole forces, hydrogen bonding, and
ionic interactions.
35
Chapter 3: Fun with Carbon: Organic Chemistry

Dipole-dipole forces
Dipole-dipole forces exist between polar regions of different molecules. The
presence of a dipole means that the molecule has a partially positive (δ+) end
and a partially negative (δ–) end. Opposite partial charges will attract each
other, whereas like partial charges will repel. In most cases, biological sys-
tems utilize a special type of dipole-dipole force known as hydrogen bonding
(see next section).
Hydrogen bonding
Hydrogen bonding, as the name implies, involves hydrogen. The hydrogen
atom must be bonded to either an oxygen atom or a nitrogen atom. (In non-
biological situations, hydrogen bonding also occurs when a hydrogen atom
bonds to a fluorine atom.) Hydrogen bonding is significantly stronger than a
“normal” dipole-dipole force and is very much stronger than London disper-
sion forces (very weak and short-lived attractions between molecules that
arise due to the nucleus of one atom attracting the electron cloud of another
atom). The hydrogen that is bonded to either a nitrogen or oxygen atom is
strongly attracted to a different nitrogen or oxygen atom. Hydrogen bonding
may be either intramolecular or intermolecular.
Ionic interactions
In biological systems, ionic interactions may serve as intermolecular or
intramolecular forces. In some cases, these may involve metal cations, such
as Na+, or anions, such as Cl-. In many cases, the cation is an ammonium ion
from an amino group, such as RNH3
+; the anion may be from a carboxylic
acid, such as RCOO-. Oppositely charged ions attract each other strongly. 
Water-related interactions: Both 
the lovers and the haters
The predominant factor leading to hydrophobic (water-hating) interactions is
the presence of portions of a molecule containing only carbon and hydrogen.
Hydrocarbon regions are nonpolar and are attracted to other nonpolar regions
by London dispersion forces.
In general, the presence of any atom other than carbon and hydrogen makes
a region polar. Oxygen and nitrogen are the most effective elements in bio-
chemistry for making a region of a molecule polar. Sulfur is least effective of
the common biologically important elements at imparting polar character.
Dipole-dipole, hydrogen bonding, and ionic interactions are all hydrophilic
interactions. London dispersion forces are hydrophobic interactions.
36
Part I: Setting the Stage: Basic Biochemistry Concepts 

The more carbon and hydrogen atoms, without other atoms, the more impor-
tant the hydrophobic nature of a region becomes in defining the properties 
of the molecule. Note that a molecule may have both a hydrophilic and a
hydrophobic region, and both regions are important to the behavior of the
molecule. The formation of a micelle is an example of using molecules with
both hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions. 
How bond strengths affect physical 
properties of substances
The physical properties of biological substances depend on the intermole-
cular forces present. The sequence of strength is: ions > hydrogen bonding >
dipole-dipole > London. The strongest types of intermolecular forces involve
ions. Next strongest is hydrogen bonding. Polar substances interact through
dipole-dipole forces, which are weaker than hydrogen bonds. All biological
substances containing oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, or phosphorus are polar.
London forces, the weakest intermolecular forces, are important in nonpolar
situations. The hydrocarbon portion of biological molecules is nonpolar. 
Melting points, boiling points, and solubility
As the strength of forces decreases, so do the melting points, boiling points,
and solubility in water. Besides that, the vapor pressure and the solubility in
nonpolar solvents also increases.
Substances that have a high solubility in water are hydrophilic, and sub-
stances with a low solubility in water are hydrophobic.
A molecule may have both hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions. The region
that represents a greater portion of the molecule will predominate. For this
reason, for example, CH3COOH is more hydrophilic than CH3CH2CH2CH2CH2
CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH. In addition, HOCH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2OH is more
hydrophilic than CH3CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2OH.
Odors
Many functional groups have distinctive odors. Small carboxylic acids smell
like acetic acid (vinegar), while larger ones have unpleasant odors. Most
esters, if volatile, have pleasant odors — that is why esters are used exten-
sively in the flavor and perfume industry. Most sulfur-containing compounds
have strong unpleasant odors. Small amines have an ammonia odor, whereas
larger amines have a fishy odor or worse.
37
Chapter 3: Fun with Carbon: Organic Chemistry

Defining a Molecule’s Reactivity:
Functional Groups
Most carbon compounds have one or more reactive sites composed of a 
specific grouping of atoms in their structure. It is at these sites that chemi-
cal reactions occur. These specific grouping of atoms that react are called
functional groups. These functional groups contain atoms other than carbon
and hydrogen and/or double or triple bonds and define the reactivity of the
organic molecule.
Hydrocarbons
Alkanes are hydrocarbons — compounds containing only carbon and hydro-
gen, with no traditional functional groups. For this reason, they are not very
reactive. Alkenes and alkynes are also hydrocarbons. They contain a carbon-
carbon double and triple bond, respectively. The presence of more than one
bond makes them more reactive. Aromatic hydrocarbons, normally ring struc-
tures with alternating single and double carbon-to-carbon bonds, contain one
or more aromatic systems, which are much less reactive than other systems
containing double bonds. Alkynes are not very common in biological sys-
tems. Figure 3-2 shows the structure of these compounds.
Functional groups with oxygen and sulfur
Many functional groups contain oxygen, including alcohols, ethers, aldehy-
des, and ketones, which appear in carbohydrates. In carbohydrates, many
ether groups are known as glycoside linkages. In addition, carboxylic acids
and esters are important functional groups that appear as fatty acids and in
fats and oils.

Alcohols and ethers contain only singly bonded oxygen atoms. An alcohol
group attached to an aromatic ring is a phenol. Aldehydes and ketones con-
tain only doubly bonded oxygen atoms. Carboxylic acids and esters contain
both singly and doubly bonded oxygen atoms. The combination of a carbon
atom connected to an oxygen atom by a double bond is a carbonyl group. 
Sulfur, the element immediately below oxygen on the periodic table, may
replace oxygen in both alcohols and ethers to give thiols (mercaptans) and
thioethers. Many of these sulfur-containing compounds really stink! Sulfur
may also form a disulfide where there is a bond between two sulfur atoms.

Chapter 3: Fun with Carbon: Organic Chemistry

Functional groups containing nitrogen
Amines and amides are two important functional groups containing nitrogen.
Amines are present in amino acids and alkaloids. Amides are present in pro-
teins, where they are known as peptide bonds.
The difference between an amine and an amide is that amides have a carbonyl
group adjacent to the nitrogen atom. Amines are derivatives of ammonia, NH3,
where one or more organic groups replace hydrogen atoms. In a primary
amine, an organic group replaces one hydrogen atom. In secondary and 
tertiary amines, two and three organic groups, respectively, replace two or
three hydrogen atoms. Figure 3-4 shows these compounds.
Alkaloids are basic compounds produced by plants. Examples include nico-
tine, caffeine, and morphine.
Functional groups containing phosphorus
Phosphorus is also an important element in biological systems and is nor-
mally present as part of a phosphate group. Phosphate groups come from
phosphoric acid, H3PO4. The phosphate groups may be alone, part of a
diphosphate, part of a triphosphate, or part of a phosphate ester.
Phosphates appear in teeth and bone and are a part of the energy transport
molecules ATP and ADP (see Chapter 12 for more on these). Figure 3-5 illus-
trates phosphorous-containing functional groups.

Reactions of functional groups
As you study the different biochemical molecules and their functions within
the living organism, you see that the way a certain molecule reacts is primar-
ily determined by the functional groups in the molecule’s structure. Take a
few minutes and refresh your organic chemistry knowledge about the typical
reactions of the various functional groups.
Alcohols
Alcohols are subject to oxidation. Mild oxidation of a primary alcohol (where
the –OH is attached to an end carbon) produces an aldehyde, which may
undergo further oxidation to a carboxylic acid. Under similar conditions, a
secondary alcohol (–OH is attached to a carbon bonded to two other car-
bons) will yield a ketone, and a tertiary alcohol (–OH attached to a carbon
bonded to three other carbons) will not react. This behavior is important in
the chemistry of many carbohydrates.

Chapter 3: Fun with Carbon: Organic Chemistry

The presence of the OH leads people mistakenly to assume that alcohols are
bases. Nothing could be further from the truth! Alcohols, under biological
conditions, are neutral compounds. Phenols, though, are weak acids.
Aldehydes and ketones
Aldehydes easily undergo oxidation to carboxylic acids, but ketones do not
undergo mild oxidation. With difficulty, it is possible to reduce aldehydes and
ketones back to the appropriate alcohols.
Reducing sugars behave as such due to mild oxidation of the carbonyl groups
present. Tollen’s test uses silver nitrate, in which a reducing sugar generates
a silver mirror on the walls of the container. Both Benedict’s and Fehling’s
tests use copper compounds, and a reducing sugar produces a red precipi-
tate with either of these tests. These simple organic qualitative tests find
some use in biochemical tests described later in this book.
The carbonyl group of an aldehyde or ketone may interact with an alcohol 
to form acetals and hemiacetals. (Modern terminology only uses the terms
acetals and hemiacetals — you may sometime see the terms hemiketal, which
is a type of hemiacetal, and ketal, a type of acetal.) See Figure 3-6 for an illus-
tration of these.
Carboxylic acids
Carboxylic acids, along with phosphoric acid, are the most important biologi-
cal acids. Carboxylic acids react with bases such as the amines to produce
salts. The salts contain an ammonium ion from the amine and a carboxylate
ion from the acid.
Carboxylic acids combine with alcohols to form esters and can indirectly
combine with amines to form amides. Hydrolysis of an ester or an amide
breaks the bond and inserts water. An acid, base, or enzyme is needed to

catalyze it. Under acidic conditions, it is possible to isolate the acid and
either the alcohol or the ammonium ion from the amine. Under basic condi-
tions, you can isolate the carboxylate ion and either the alcohol or the amine.
Thiols and amines
Under mild oxidation, two thiols join to form a disulfide. Mild reducing condi-
tions, catalyzed by enzymes, reverse this process. Such formation of disulfide
linkages is important in the chemistry of many proteins, such as insulin.
Amines are the most important biological bases. As bases, they can react
with acids. The behavior is related to the behavior of ammonia.
NH3 + H+ (from an acid) →NH4
+ (ammonium ion)
NRH2 + H+ (from an acid) →NRH3
+ (ammonium ion)
NR2H + H+ (from an acid) →NR2H2
+ (ammonium ion)
NR3 + H+ (from an acid) →NR3H+ (ammonium ion)
Many medications have amine groups. In order to make them more readily
soluble, it is necessary to convert many of these amines to ammonium ions.
For example, the reaction of the medication with hydrochloric acid forms 
the chloride, which often appears on the label as the hydrochloride.
It is possible to replace all the hydrogen atoms from an ammonium ion, NH4
+,
to produce a quaternary ammonium ion, NR4
+.
Phosphoric acid
Phosphoric acid, H3PO4, may behave like a carboxylic acid and form esters.
The esters will have an organic group, R, replacing one, two, or three of the
hydrogen atoms. The resultant compounds are monoesters, diesters, and tri-
esters. The hydrogen atoms remaining in the mono- and diesters are acidic.
pH and functional groups
Many of the biological functions of substances are pH dependent. For this
reason, it is important to know which functional groups are acidic, basic, or
neutral. Neutral functional groups behave the same no matter what the pH is.
Table 3-3 lists the functional groups and whether or not they are acidic, neu-
tral, or basic. In addition, we list whether they are of medium weakness, weak,
or very weak. The weaker a substance in terms of pH, the less likely it will be
affected by its solution pH.

Same Content, Different 
Structure: Isomerism
Isomers are compounds that have the same molecular formula, but different
structural formulas. Some organic and biochemical compounds may exist 
in different isomeric forms. Many times, especially in biological systems,
these different isomers have different properties. The two most common
types of isomers in biological systems are cis-trans isomers and isomerism
due to the presence of a chiral carbon.
44
Part I: Setting the Stage: Basic Biochemistry Concepts 

Cis-trans isomers
The presence of carbon-carbon double bonds leads to the possibility of having
isomers present. Double bonds are rather restrictive and limit molecular
movement. Groups on the same side of the double bond tend to remain in
that position (cis), whereas groups on opposite sides tend to remain across
the bond from each other (trans). See Figure 3-7 for an illustration.
If the two groups attached to either of the carbon atoms of the double bond
are the same, cis-trans isomers are not possible. Cis isomers are the normal
form of fatty acids, whereas food processing tends to convert some of the 
cis isomers to the trans isomers.
Cis-trans isomers are also possible in cyclic systems. The cis form has similar
groups on the same side of the ring, whereas the trans form has similar groups
above and below the ring.
Chiral carbons
Trying to put your gloves on the wrong hands is kind of like another property
of biological systems: handedness. There are left-handed molecules and right-
handed molecules.
Identifying chiral molecules
The presence of an asymmetric, or chiral, carbon atom is sufficient to produce
a “handed” molecule.
A chiral carbon atom has four different groups attached to it. The majority 
of biological molecules have one or more chiral carbon atoms and, for this
reason, they are chiral. Figure 3-8 shows the chiral nature of glucose.

Determining the chiral form: Enantiomer or sterioisomer?
All substances have a mirror image (okay, except vampires); however, if there
is a chiral carbon atom present, the mirror images are nonsuperimposable.
Hold out your left and right hands, palms up — they are nonsuperimposable
mirror images. These two mirror images are called enantiomers. The different
chiral forms differ from each other in two aspects:
 How they affect light
 How they interact with other chiral substances (usually only one chiral
form will be biologically active)
To determine how a particular form affects light, it is necessary to use plane
polarized light, in which all the light waves vibrate in the same plane. When
you use this kind of light, a chiral substance rotates the vibrational plane of
the light — one form (the dextrorotatory, d, (+) isomer) rotates the plane 
to the right, while the other (the levorotatory, l, (–) isomer) rotates the 
plane to the left. The d and l forms are stereoisomers and are optically active. 
Illustrating the chiral compound: Fisher projection formulas
A chemist named Emil Fischer developed a method of drawing a compound
to illustrate which stereoisomer was present. These Fischer projection for-
mulas are very useful in biochemistry. In a projection formula, a chiral
carbon is placed in the center of a + pattern. The vertical lines (bonds) are
pointing away from the viewer, and the horizontal lines are pointing toward
the viewer. Fischer used the D designation if the most important group (the
group whose central atom had the largest atomic number) was to the right of
the carbon, and the L designation if the most important group (lowest atomic
number) was to the left of the carbon. Figure 3-9 shows two Fischer projec-
tion formulas.

The d and l symbols are not necessarily the D and L forms respectively; thus,
confusion may occur and lead to incorrect predictions. For this reason, the
use of d and l is diminishing. The use of D and L is gradually being replaced
by the R and S system of designating isomers. This system is particularly
useful when more than one chiral carbon atom is present. For a description
of this system, see Organic Chemistry For Dummies by Arthur Winter (Wiley).

Amino Acids: The Building

In This Chapter
 Looking at the structure and properties of amino acids
 Examining the common amino acids
 Finding out about the interactions of amino acids
 Seeing how amino acids combine
A
ll cells contain thousands of types of proteins, and amino acids are the
building blocks of these proteins. The sequential order, number, and
chemical identity of the amino acids in the protein determine the structure 
of the protein as well as how the protein functions. That’s why it’s important
to understand the chemical properties of amino acids before you can under-
stand the behavior of proteins.
Amino acids are relatively simple molecules containing both an amine group
and an acid group. The biologically important amino acids are the α-amino
acids that have the amine and acid groups attached to the same carbon atom.
There are more than 100 known natural amino acids; however, only 20 of them
are used in protein synthesis. Francis Crick (who with James Watson deter-
mined the structure of DNA) labeled this set of amino acids the magic 20.
Other amino acids are found in certain proteins, but in almost all cases these
additional amino acids result from the modification of one of the magic 20
after the protein formed.
In this chapter, we examine the structure and properties of amino acids, espe-
cially the more common ones, and show how they interact and combine.

General Properties of Amino Acids
Like any organic compound, the properties of the molecules are largely deter-
mined by the functional groups present. In biological systems, the important
properties of the amino acids include the following:
 They can join to form proteins. The average molecular weight of an
amino acid is about 135. Proteins have molecular weights ranging from
about 6,000 to several million. Thus, a large number of amino acids must
be joined together to produce a protein.
 They all have both an acid and a base. The α-carbon (end carbon) not
only has an amine group (–NH2) and a carboxylic acid group (–COOH),
but also two additional groups: a hydrogen atom and an R– group. The
side chain, R group, identifies the amino acid.
 They all have variations in what part of the structure is protonated
depending on the pH of the solution and the structure of the rest of
the molecule.
 They all, except glycine, have a chiral nature, influencing the reactions
that the compound will undergo.
Amino acids are positive and negative: 
The zwitterion formation
The presence of both an acid and a base (amine) in the same molecule leads
to an interaction between the two. This interaction results in a transfer of a
hydrogen ion from the acid portion to the base portion of the molecule. An
amino acid with both positive and negative regions is a called a zwitterion.
The net charge of the zwitterion is 0. This leaves the acid end of the amino
acid with a negative charge (–COO-) and a positive charge at the base end
(–NH3
+). The deprotonated portion (portion that has lost a hydrogen ion) is a
carboxylate group, and the protonated group (group that has gained a hydro-
gen ion) is an ammonium group. The presence of a charge on the amino acid
makes them water-soluble. Figure 4-1 shows zwitterion formation.

The unionized amino acid molecule shown in Figure 4-1 does not actually
exist. However, many books and instructors draw the unionized form as a
simplification, as if the ionization did not occur.
Protonated? pH and the isoelectric point
How amino acids react, because of their acid-base nature, is dependent on
the pH of the solution in which they are found. Here we look at some of the
implications of this pH dependency. The zwitterion is the predominant form
at a particular pH, which is designated the isoelectric point (pI). The isoelec-
tric point is midway between the two different pKa values. Under most 
physiological conditions, isolated amino acids exist in their zwitterion form
(Figure 4-2 (a)). Pure amino acids are also in the zwitterion form — and, for
this reason, are ionic solids.
 At a pH below the isoelectric point, some of the carboxylate groups
will be protonated. (See Figure 4-2 (b).) The pH required to cause this
protonation of the carboxylate group depends on the Ka of the acid. For
this reason the pKa of the carboxylic acid group is important. Typical
values are between 1 and 3. If, for example, the pKa is 2.5, at a pH of 2.5,
50 percent of the carboxylate groups will be protonated. The net charge
of the protonated form is +1.
 At a pH above the isoelectric point, some of the ammonium groups
will be deprotonated. (See Figure 4-2 (c).) The pH required to cause this
deprotonation of the ammonium group depends on the Ka of the ammo-
nium group. For this reason, the pKa of the ammonium group is impor-
tant. Typical values are between 8 and 11. If, for example, the pKa is 10,
at a pH of 10, 50 percent of the ammonium groups will be deprotonated.
The net charge of the protonated form is –1.
Some of the side chains are also acidic or basic. In these cases, an additional
pKa becomes significant in the reactions of these molecules and will obviously
complicate the pH behavior of the amino acid.

Chapter 4: Amino Acids: The Building Blocks of Protein

Asymmetry: Chiral amino acids
In a typical α-amino acid, four different groups are attached to the α-carbon
(–COOH, –NH2, –R, and –H). This makes the α-carbon asymmetric or chiral.
The only exception is the amino acid glycine, where the R– group is a hydro-
gen atom. The presence of two hydrogen atoms on the α-carbon means that,
in the case of glycine, the carbon atom is achiral. Chiral materials are opti-
cally active; the different forms affect light in different ways. (See Chapter 3
for more on what makes a molecule chiral.)
The arrangement of the groups around a chiral carbon atom is important.
Just as your left hand only fits into your left glove, only certain arrangements
of the groups will fit (because of what is called handedness).
There are two different forms of the chiral amino acids: the D- and the L- forms.
Only the L- forms are constituents of proteins. The D- forms appear in some
antibiotics and in the cell walls of certain bacteria. Fischer projections, as we
explain in Chapter 3, are commonly used to represent the arrangement about
the chiral carbon. Figure 4-3 illustrates some different ways to draw the Fischer
projections of the structure of amino acids.
A few amino acids contain two asymmetric carbon atoms. In these cases,
there are four possible isomers. Biological activity is usually limited to only
one of these four isomers.

The Magic 20 Amino Acids
Amino acids are subdivided into four subgroups based on the nature of the
side chain (groups attached to the the α-carbon) and the general behavior 
of the amino acid:
 Nonpolar (hydrophobic) and uncharged
 Polar (hydrophilic) and uncharged
 Acidic (polar and charged)
 Basic (polar and charged)
The properties of the side chains are not only important to the behavior of
the individual amino acids but also to the properties of the proteins resulting
from the combination of certain amino acids.
In the following section we examine the structures of the individual amino
acids. It is possible to represent each of the amino acids by either a three-
letter or a one-letter abbreviation. Like the chemical symbols for the elements,
these are fixed abbreviations. The three-letter abbreviations are easier to
relate to the name of the specific amino acid. For example, we use glu for glu-
tamine. The one-letter abbreviations are shorter, but not always related to
the name. For example, we use Q for glutamine.
Nonpolar (hydrophobic) amino acids
The nonpolar amino acids are as follows:
 Alanine (ala, A)
 Valine (val, V)
 Leucine (leu, L)
 Isoleucine (ile, I)
 Proline (pro, P)
 Methionine (met, M)
 Phenylalanine (phe, F)
 Tryptophan (trp, W)
Figure 4-4 shows these amino acids.
55
Chapter 4: Amino Acids: The Building Blocks of Protein

Proline has an unusual cyclic structure, which has a significant influence on
protein structure. Tryptophan is a borderline case because the –NH from the
ring system can interact with water to a limited extent.

Polar and uncharged (hydrophilic) 
amino acids
The polar and uncharged amino acids, other than glycine, can hydrogen bond
to water. For this reason, they are usually more soluble than the nonpolar
amino acids. The amino acids in this group are as follows:
 Glycine (gly, G)
 Serine (ser, S)
 Asparagine (asn, N)
 Glutamine (gln, Q)
 Threonine (thr, T)
 Tyrosine (tyr, Y)
 Cysteine (cys, C)
Glycine seems to be an unexpected member of this group. The small size of
the R group in the case of glycine leads to the predominance of the amino
and carboxylate functional groups, giving glycine’s similarity to other amino
acids in this group. The amide, alcohol, and sulfhydryl (–SH) groups of the
remaining members of this group are very polar and neutral. At very high pH
values, the phenolic group on tyrosine ionizes to yield a polar charged group.
Figure 4-5 shows these amino acids.
Acidic amino acids
The acidic amino acids are as follows:
 Aspartic acid (asp, D)
 Glutamic acid (glu, E)
In both of these amino acids, the side group contains a carboxylic acid group.
This secondary carboxylic acid group is a weaker acid (higher pKa) than the
primary carboxylic acid group. This additional carboxylate group leads to a
net –1 charge at a pH where the “normal” zwitterion has a 0 net charge. The
carboxylate side chain is important in the interaction of many proteins with
metal ions, as nucleophiles (an electron-rich group replacing some group
attached to a carbon) in many enzymes, and in ionic interactions. Figure 4-6
shows these amino acids.

Basic amino acids
The basic amino acids are as follows:
 Histidine (his, H)
 Arginine (arg, R)
 Lysine (lys, K)
All of these are classified as basic amino acids, but dramatic changes in pH
can affect their reactivities. This is especially true of histidine.
In all three of these amino acids, there is a basic group capable of accepting a
hydrogen ion. In the case of lysine, this is a simple ammonium ion. Arginine
forms the guanidinium group. Histidine forms an imidazolium group. As in
the case of the acidic side chains, these side chains have a pKa value. Both
arginine and lysine are usually protonated at physiological pH values. In
these cases, there is a net +1 charge present. In proteins, this net charge may
be part of an ionic interaction. The pKa of the side chain of histidine is lower
than other basic groups. Protonation of histidine becomes significant at
much lower pH values. In many proteins, histidine is not protonated, but is
important in many enzymes in hydrogen ion transfer processes. Figure 4-7
shows these basic amino acids.
Lest We Forget: Rarer Amino Acids
In a few cases, an amino acid may undergo modification once it is incorpo-
rated into a protein. Collagen and gelatin, for example — proteins present in
higher vertebrates — contain hydroxylysine and hydroxyproline. These two
amino acids contain an additional –OH group on the side chain.

Chapter 4: Amino Acids: The Building Blocks of Protein

Certain amino acids do not occur in proteins. The neurotransmitter γ-
aminobutyric acid — GABA — is one example. Citrulline is the amino 
acid that serves as a precursor of arginine. Ornithine, homocysteine, and
homoserine are important as metabolic intermediates. Figure 4-8 shows a
couple of these amino acids.
Rudiments of Amino Acid Interactions
Amino acids are the ingredients used in the recipe in making a protein. Just
as the individual ingredients in a recipe lead to distinct characteristics of
what eventually shows up on the dinner table, the amino acids present con-
tribute properties to proteins. And just as you cannot replace the flour in a
recipe with pepper, you generally cannot replace one amino acid in a protein
with another. In both cases, the final product will be different. In the next sec-
tion, we show you some of the ways that amino acids interact. These interac-
tions set the stage for our discussion of bonding among the amino acids.

Intermolecular forces: How an amino 
acid reacts with other molecules
Amino acids can interact with other molecules — and we mean any other mole-
cules, including fluids, other amino acids, and other biological molecules — in
a variety of ways. We cover intermolecular forces in general in Chapter 3, but 
in this section we show you how they play out when amino acids are involved.
The carboxylic acid and amine parts of the amino acids define much of the
reactivity of the molecule, but the side chains can also interact with other mol-
ecules. There are three general ways in which they can interact.
 Hydrophobic interactions: The nonpolar side groups are hydrophobic
and are attracted to each other through London dispersion forces.
Nonpolar groups tend to clump together and exclude not only water but
also all other types of side chains. 
 Hydrophilic reactions: The polar and uncharged side groups are
hydrophilic. The presence of a number of these groups increases the 
solubility of a protein. These groups hydrogen bond not only to water
but also to each other. Polar groups tend to interact strongly and “push”
the nonpolar groups out.
 Ionic interactions: The presence of acidic or basic side chains leads to
ionic charges — opposite charges attract. A carboxylate group from one
side chain is attracted to the ammonium ion of another side chain through
an ionic interaction. This ionic bond is very strong.
The amino acid cysteine can interact with a second cysteine molecule through
a different type of interaction (Figure 4-9). The mild oxidation of two cysteine
sulfhydryl groups leads to the formation of cystine. A disulfide linkage joins
the two amino acids with a covalent bond. Mild reduction can reverse this
process.

A hair perm utilizes an oxidation reduction reaction creating disulfide linkages.
The greater the number of disulfide linkages, the curlier the hair!
Altering interactions by changing 
an amino acid’s pH
As we discuss in Chapter 3, the function of many substances, especially bio-
chemical ones, is dependent on pH. If you change the pH, you change some 
of the interactions. In this section we show how those changes affect interac-
tions involving amino acids.
Just like any other molecule, an amino acid has two or three functional groups,
depending on the amino acid. Those functional groups include those with
oxygen and sulfur, those with nitrogen, and those with phosphorus. A change
in pH affects one to three of those functional groups in terms of interactions.
So if an amino acid has a functional group that changes from a dipole-dipole
interaction to an ionic interaction.
One example of the dipole-dipole to ionic interaction change is the process of
milk curdling. If you add an acid to milk, it coagulates. Casein has an isoelec-
tric point at 4.6 pH, so that adding an acid causes the formation of ionic bonds
among the molecules. This works against the dipole-dipole interactions with
water, so that the protein precipitates. 
The pKa values for the various groups present in the different amino acids are
shown in Table 4-1. If the pH of the solution matches one of these values,
then half the species is in the protonated form and half is in the deprotonated

form. At a lower pH, more than half is protonated, whereas at a higher pH
more than half is deprotonated.
The pH dependence of the protonation of amino acids aids in their separa-
tion and identification. Because the amino acids use the carboxylic acid and
amine ends when they join to form a protein, only the pKa values of the side
chains are important in additional interactions and reactions.

Chapter 4: Amino Acids: The Building Blocks of Protein

Combining Amino Acids: How It Works
A protein is a string of at least 150 amino acids (residues) joined. We cover
the fundamentals about protein creation in Chapter 5, but before you dive
into that topic, this section gives you a solid understanding of how two
amino acids join together in the first place, and how additional amino acids
link onto the chain gang. The process is reversible (as in digestion).
When drawing the chemical structures of amino acids and their bonds, the
standard convention is to first draw the structures from the ammonium
group of the first amino acid (the N-terminal residue), starting at the left, 
and continuing the drawing to the right, ending with the carboxylate group
(C-terminal residue) of the last amino acid. 
The peptide bond and the dipeptide
One of the most important types of bonds in all of biochemistry is the peptide
bond. As you will see, it is this type of bond that will be used in the synthesis
of proteins. The interaction of two amino acids at the body’s pH results in the
formation of a peptide bond as illustrated in Figure 4-10.
The two residues react to expel a water molecule, the same dehydration you
used so much in organic chemistry. The reverse of this condensation reaction
is hydrolysis. The resultant amide group is a peptide bond. The presence of
two amino acid residues means the product is a dipeptide.

Part II: The Meat of Biochemistry: Proteins 

The peptide bond is a flat (planar) structure. It is stabilized by our old organic
friend, resonance. Figure 4-11 illustrates the stabilization. The resonance
increases the polarity of the nitrogen and oxygen. This increase in polarity
leads to hydrogen bonds that are much stronger than most other hydrogen
bonds. The double bond character between the carbon and the nitrogen
restricts rotation about this bond. That’s why the peptide bond is planar.
Tripeptide: adding an amino 
acid to a dipeptide
A repetition of the process illustrated in Figure 4-10 joins a third amino acid
to produce a tripeptide. For example, combining glycine, alanine, and serine
yields the illustration in Figure 4-12. Notice that everything begins with the 
N-terminal residue and ends with the C-terminal residue. (You could designate
this tripeptide as gly-ala-ser using the three letter abbreviations.)
The repetition of the process of linking amino acids hundreds or thousands
of times produces a protein. In the next chapter, we cover that topic in full.

n Chapter 4, we show you how amino acids combine through the use of a
peptide bond, and we mention there that if at least 150 or so amino acids
join hands, they rise to the rank of a protein. However, distinguishing an
amino acid chain as a protein isn’t exactly simple — just as written English 
is an extremely diverse set of words made by combining letters from an
alphabet of just 26 letters, proteins are an extremely diverse set of biochemi-
cals made by combining 20 different amino acids.
In this chapter, we show you more about these proteins, including the four
types of protein structure that determine a protein’s function and the sequence
of amino acids in a particular protein.
There are two general categories of proteins: 
 Fibrous proteins are found only in animals. They usually serve as struc-
tural entities — for example, connective tissue, tendons, and muscle
fiber. They are normally insoluble in water. 
 Globular proteins usually do not serve a structural function — they act
as transporters, like hemoglobin, and are often enzymes. They are usu-
ally water-soluble.
Proteins are utilized in living organisms in a number of ways, such as:
 Structure: Skin and bone contain collagen, a fibrous protein.
 Catalysis: These proteins, called enzymes, allow reactions to occur in
the organism under mild conditions and with great specificity.
 Movement: Proteins make up a large protein of muscle fiber and help in
the movement of various parts of our bodies.

 Transport: These proteins transport small molecules through the 
organism. Hemoglobin, the protein that transports oxygen to the cells, 
is a transport protein.
 Hormones: Proteins called hormones help regulate cell growth.
 Protection: Proteins called antibodies help rid the body of foreign 
proteins.
 Storage: These protein help store other substance in the organism. For
example, iron is stored in the liver in a complex with the protein ferritin.
 Regulation: These proteins help mediate cell responses, such as the pro-
tein rhodopsin, found in the eye and involved in the vision process.
The function that a particular protein assumes is, in many cases, directly
related to the structure of that protein. Proteins may have as many as four
levels of structure (key word being levels, not different structures), each of
which places the components into a position where these intermolecular
forces can interact most advantageously. The levels are simply labeled pri-
mary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary. Primary is the most fundamental
level that all proteins have, and quaternary is the most specific level that
only some proteins have. Intermolecular forces themselves are important to
the function of a protein, of course, but the arrangement of the molecules is
even more significant.
If present, the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of a protein may
be destroyed — in a number of ways:
 Heating (cooking) can break hydrogen bonds.
 Changing the pH can protonate or deprotonate the molecule and interrupt
ionic interactions.
 Reducing agents can break disulfide linkages.
In some cases, the process may be reversible.
Primary Structure: The Structure 
Level All Proteins Have
The primary structure of a protein is simply the sequence of amino acids
comprising the molecule. The primary structure of a protein is the amino
acid sequence within the molecule. All proteins have a primary structure,
because all proteins by definition consist of a sequence of amino acids. The
primary structure serves as the foundation upon which all higher levels of
protein structure build.
68
Part II: The Meat of Biochemistry: Proteins 

Next we take a look at how a protein is assembled from its building blocks,
the amino acids.
Building a protein: Outlining the process
During the synthesis of a protein, the chain of amino acids is built one link at
a time, roughly as follows:
1. The transfer RNA (tRNA) molecule transfers specific amino acids to
the mitochondria of the cell to connect to the growing chain. 
2. Each amino acid joins to the chain through the formation of a peptide
bond. (See Chapter 4 for more on peptide bonds.)
3. The first peptide bond joins two amino acids to form a dipeptide. 
4. The second peptide bond joins three amino acids to produce a 
tripeptide. 
5. This process continues hundreds, if not thousands, of times to produce
a polypeptide — a protein. 
When two or more amino acids combine, a molecule of water is removed. What
remains of each amino acid is called a residue. They lack a hydrogen atom on
the amino group, or an –OH on the carboxyl group, or both.
The cell’s DNA ultimately controls the sequence of amino acids. This informa-
tion goes from the DNA to the messenger RNA (mRNA), which serves as the
template for the creation of the primary structure of the protein. It is neces-
sary to supply energy, as we will see later, to synthesize the protein.
Organizing the amino acids
One end of the primary structure has an amino group, and the other end has
a carboxylate group. By convention, the end with the amino group is consid-
ered the “beginning” of the protein. Drawing, naming, numbering, and other
treatments of the primary structure always begin with the amino end (called
the N-terminal) and stop with the carboxylate end (the C-terminal). For exam-
ple, in the hexapeptide Met-Thr-Ser-Val-Asp-Lys (see Chapter 4 for a list of the
amino acids and their abbreviations), methionine (Met) is the N-terminal
amino acid, and lysine (Lys) is the C-terminal amino acid. Note that reversing
the sequence to Lys-Asp-Val-Ser-Thr-Met also gives a hexapeptide with the
same composition but with different chemical properties because you ini-
tially started with a different amino acid. Therefore an amino acid that lost a
hydrogen in one sequence will lose an –OH in the other.
69
Chapter 5: Protein Structure and Function

The polypeptide chain has a backbone consisting of the same, rather simple,
repeating unit. Variations take place in the form of side chains — the R groups
of the amino acids. You can see this repeating sequence in Figure 5-1. Notice
that the repeating unit (indicated by the brackets) is the amino-carbon-
carbonyl sequence and that there can be different R groups attached to 
the carbon unit of this backbone.
The protein backbone has many places where hydrogen bonds may form.
Every residue — other than the amino acid proline — has an NH, which may
serve as a donor to a hydrogen bond. And every residue has a carbonyl group,
which can serve as the acceptor of a hydrogen bond. The presence of donors
and acceptors leads to the possibility of forming numerous hydrogen bonds. 
Each of the peptide bonds exhibits no free rotation about the carbon-nitrogen
bond because of the contribution of the resonance form, which has a double
bond. Thus, there is a planar unit of four atoms, and in almost all cases, the
oxygen atom is trans to the hydrogen atom. The remainder of the backbone
can rotate. The ability to rotate or not influences how the three-dimensional
structure of the protein is established. There are restrictions to this rotation
because the side-chains can “bump” into each other — called steric hindrance.
The rigidity of the peptide bond and rotation restrictions lower the entropy
of the three-dimensional structure of a protein relative to a random chain of
amino acids. Lowering the entropy helps stabilize the structure.
Example: The primary structure of insulin
The first determination of the primary structure of a protein was that of bovine
insulin, the structure of which appears in Figure 5-2. Since this landmark deter-
mination, the primary structures of more than 100,000 proteins have been
determined. In all cases, the protein has a unique primary structure.

Secondary Structure: A Structure 
Level Most Proteins Have 
It is possible for one peptide bond to form a hydrogen bond to another pep-
tide bond. In general, the formation of these hydrogen bonds leads to the 
secondary structure of a protein. The secondary structure is the result of
many hydrogen bonds, not just one. The hydrogen bonds are intramolecular,
that is between segments of the same molecule, as shown in Figure 5–3:
The α-helix and β-pleated sheet are the secondary structures that result from
this hydrogen bonding. Secondary structures may be only a small portion of
the structure of a protein or can make up 75 percent or more.

Chapter 5: Protein Structure and Function

The α-helix
In the α-helix, the primary structure twists into a tightly wound, spring or
rod-like structure. Each turn consists of 3.6 amino acid residues. These turns
allow hydrogen bonding between residues spaced four apart. Every peptide
bond participates in two hydrogen bonds: one from an NH to a neighboring
carbonyl, and one from a neighboring NH to the carbonyl (Figure 5-4).
Structurally, the helices may be either right-handed or left-handed (see
Chapter 3 for more on handedness). Essentially all known polypeptides are
right-handed. Slightly more steric hindrance is present in a left-handed helix,
and the additional steric hindrance makes the structure less stable. Keratin —
the protein of fur, hair, and nails — consists of three right-handed α-helices
wrapped around each other in a left-handed coil.

Part II: The Meat of Biochemistry: Proteins 

Certain amino acids destabilize the α-helix. Proline, for example, creates
bends or “kinks” in the primary structure, which inhibit the formation of a
regular pattern of hydrogen bonds. A group of isoleucine residues disrupts
the secondary structure because of the steric hindrance caused by their
bulky R groups. The small R group of glycine, only an H, allows too much free-
dom of movement, which leads to a destabilization of the helix. A concentra-
tion of aspartic acid and/or glutamic acid residues also destabilizes the
structure because the negative charges on the side chains repel each other.
Other residues that destabilize the helix, for similar reasons, are lysine, argi-
nine, serine, and threonine.
The β-pleated sheet
The β-pleated sheet, or simply the β sheet, is the other major secondary pro-
tein structure. Here, the primary structure is extended instead of tightly
winding into a helix. There are two forms of this structure, known as the par-
allel β-pleated sheet and the anti-parallel β-pleated sheet. Again, hydrogen
bonds are the source of these structures. A β-pleated sheet forms when two
or more strands link by hydrogen bonds. The strands are different parts of
the same primary structure.
In the parallel structure, the adjacent polypeptide strands align along the
same direction from N-terminal end to C-terminal end. In the anti-parallel
structure, the alignment is such that one strand goes from N-terminal end 
to C-terminal end, while the adjacent strand goes from C-terminal end to 
N-terminal end (Figure 5-5).
In the β-pleated sheet structures, the side chains of adjacent amino acids
point in opposite directions. The hydrogen bonding pattern in the parallel
structure is the more complicated. Here, the NH group of one residue links to
a CO on the adjacent strand, whereas the CO of the first residue links to the
NH on the adjacent strand that is two residues down the strand. In the anti-
parallel structure, the NH and CO groups of one residue link to the respective
CO and NH groups of one residue on the adjacent strand.
Schematically, broad arrows indicate the presence of β-pleated sheets. If the
arrows point in the same direction, it is the parallel structure, and if they
point in opposite directions, it is the anti-parallel structure. The sheets are
typically 4 or 5 strands wide, but 10 or more strands are possible. The
arrangements may be purely parallel, purely anti-parallel, or mixed (refer 
to Figure 5-5).
73
Chapter 5: Protein Structure and Function

β-turns and the Ω-loops
There are additional secondary structures involving hydrogen bonding
between peptide bonds; these are much smaller units. The best known are
the β-turn — or hairpin bend — and the Ω-loop. The hairpin bend is simply a
bend in the primary structure held in place by a hydrogen bond. The Ω-loop
gets its name because of the loose similarity of its shape to the Greek letter.
Both are found on the exterior of proteins.

Tertiary Structure: A Structure 
Level Many Proteins Have
The overall shape of a protein is determined by its primary and secondary
structures along with interactions between the side chains. This gives rise 
to what is called the protein’s tertiary structure. Nonpolar side chains are
hydrophobic and, although repelled by water, are attracted to each other.
Polar side chains attract other polar side chains through either dipole-dipole
forces or hydrogen bonds.
For example, both aspartic acid and glutamic acid yield side chains with a
negative charge that are strongly attracted to the positive charges in the side
chains of lysine and arginine. Two cysteine residues can connect by forming a
disulfide linkage — a covalent bond (Figure 5-6).

Chapter 5: Protein Structure and Function

What induces a protein to adopt a very specific tertiary structure? Examination
of the structures of many proteins shows a preponderance of nonpolar side
chains in the interior with a large number of polar or ionic side chains on the
exterior. In an aqueous environment, the hydrophobic (nonpolar) groups
induce the protein to fold upon itself, burying the hydrophobic groups away
from the water and leaving the hydrophilic groups adjacent to water. The
result is similar in structure to a micelle.
Quaternary Structure: A Structure 
Level Some Proteins Have
The quaternary structure found in some proteins results from interactions
between two or more polypeptide chains — interactions that are usually 
the same as those that give rise to the tertiary structure. These interactions
include hydrogen bonding and disulfide bonds. This quaternary structure
locks the complex of proteins into a specific geometry. An example is hemo-
globin, which has four polypeptide chains. There are two identical α-chains
and two identical β-chains. (The designations α and β simply refer to two dif-
ferent proteins and not to secondary structures.) 
Dissecting a Protein for Study

Chapter 5: Protein Structure and Function
Additional information about the structure of a protein comes from immunol-
ogy. An animal generates an antibody in response to a foreign substance
known as an antigen. Antibodies are proteins found in the blood serum.
Exposure to diseases, certain chemicals, and allergies induce the formation
of specific antibodies. These antigens collect on the surface of red blood
cells. Every antigen has a specific antibody. 
Antibodies are very specific and have a strong affinity for their specific anti-
gens, recognizing specific amino acid sequences on the antigens. Animals
have a large number of antibodies present in their bodies, based on their
environmental history. One application of antibodies and antigens is in the
analysis of bloods, specifically in the field of forensics investigations (see
nearby “Forensics: Analysis of bloodstains” sidebar).
Separating proteins within a 
cell and purifying them
There are thousands of different proteins in each cell. In order to examine
and study one of them, you need to separate it from all the others. The meth-
ods of separating proteins are, in general, applicable to all other types of 
biochemicals. Initially, simple filtration and solubility can remove gross impu-
rities, but much more needs to be done before the sample is pure. The key
separation and purification methods depend on two physical properties of
the proteins: size and charge.
Separating proteins by size
Methods relying on separation by protein size and mass include ultrafiltration,
ultracentrifugation, and size exclusion chromatography. Ultrafiltration is a
modification of dialysis in which molecules smaller than a certain size diffuse
through a semipermeable membrane, and larger ones don’t. Ultrafiltration can
separate smaller molecules from larger impurities or larger molecules from
smaller impurities. 
In ultracentrifugation, a powerful centrifuge causes heavier molecules to sink
faster and, which allows their separation — much as the lighter water is sepa-
rated from the heavier lettuce in a salad spinner. Ultracentrifugation also
gives the molar mass of the protein. 
In size exclusion chromatography, also known as molecular sieve chromatogra-
phy or gel filtration chromatography, a solution passes through a chromatogra-
phy column filled with porous beads. Molecules that are too large for the
pores pass straight through. Molecules that may enter the pores are slowed.
The molecules that may enter the pores undergo separation depending on
how easily they can enter.

Forensics: Analysis of bloodstains
The study of proteins has many applications to
forensics. One of them is the examination of
bloodstains, blood being the most common form
of evidence examined by a forensic serologist.
The presence of blood can link a suspect to both
a victim and a crime scene. Bloodstain patterns
can also give evidence of how a violent attack
took place. Criminals recognize the significance
of this evidence and often try to conceal it.
Blood is mostly water, but it also contains a
number of additional materials including cells,
proteins, and enzymes. The fluid portion, or
plasma, is mostly water. The serum is yellowish
and contains platelets and white blood cells. The
platelets, or red blood cells, outnumber the white
blood cells by about 500 to 1. White blood cells
are medically important, whereas red blood cells
and, to a lesser extent, serum are important to
the forensic serologist. Because blood quickly
clots when exposed to air, serologists must sep-
arate the serum from the clotted material. The
serum contains antibodies that have forensic
applications, and red blood cells have sub-
stances such as antigens on their surfaces that
also have forensic applications. Antibodies and
antigens are the keys to forensic serology: Even
identical twins with identical DNA have different
antibodies. As you know from this chapter, anti-
bodies, and some antigens, are proteins, and this
is why methods of studying proteins are impor-
tant to their analysis.
Analysis of bloodstains initially attempts to
answer five questions.
 Is this a blood sample? To answer this ques-
tion, the investigator can use a number of
tests. The generic term for a test of this type
is a presumptive test. The Kastle-Meyer test
uses phenolphthalein, which, when it comes
into contact with hemoglobin, or a few other
substances, forms a bright pink color from
the release of peroxidase enzymes. The
luminol test is useful in detecting invisible
bloodstains because, in contact with blood,
or a few other chemicals, luminol emits light,
which can be seen in a darkened room. The
Wagenhaar, Takayama, and Teichman tests
take advantage of the fact that long-dried
blood will crystallize or can be induced to
crystallize.
 Is the blood from a human or an animal? The
forensic investigator answers this question
(and the next one, if applicable) by means of
an antiserum test. It is important to know
whether the blood came from a human or an
animal such as a pet. The standard test is the
precipitin test. Injecting human blood into an
animal results in the production of antibod-
ies in the animal’s bloodstream, and isolating
these antibodies from the animal’s blood
yields an antiserum. If human antiserum cre-
ates clotting in a blood sample, the sample
must be human.
 If the sample is from an animal, what is the
species? It is possible to create animal anti-
serums in an analogous manner, and test for
each type of animal.
 If the blood is from a human, what is the
blood type? The procedure for answering
this depends on the quantity and quality of
the sample. If the quality is good, direct
typing is done — otherwise, indirect typing
is used. (Direct typing, to classify blood in the
A-B-O system, is discussed in this chapter’s
other sidebar.) A dried bloodstain normally
requires indirect typing. The most common
indirect typing method is the absorption-
elution test. Treatment of a sample with 
antiserum antibodies gives a solution which,
upon addition to a known sample, causes
coagulation.

Separating proteins by charge
Methods of separating proteins relying on the charge of the protein include
solubility, ion exchange chromatography, and electrophoresis. Each of these
methods is pH dependent.
Proteins are least soluble at their isoelectric point. (The isoelectric point is the
pH where the net charge on the protein is 0.) At the isoelectric point, many pro-
teins precipitate from solution. At a pH below the isoelectric point, the protein
has a net positive charge, whereas a pH above the isoelectric point imparts a
net negative charge. The magnitude of the charge depends on the pH and the
identity of the protein. Therefore, two proteins coincidently having the same
isoelectric point will not necessarily have the same net charge at a pH that is
one unit lower than the isoelectric point.
Both ion exchange chromatography and electrophoresis take advantage of
the net charge. In ion exchange chromatography, the greater the magnitude 
of the charge, the slower a protein moves through a column — this is similar
to the ion-exchange process that occurs in water-softening units. 
In electrophoresis, the sample solution is placed in an electrostatic field.
Molecules with no net charge do not move, but species with a net positive
charge move toward the negative end, and those with a net negative charge
move toward the positive end. The magnitude of the net charge determines
how fast the species moves. Other factors influence the rate of movement, but
the charge is the key. There are numerous modifications of electrophoresis.
In protein analysis, rarely do biochemists use only one single technique.
They commonly use several in order to confirm their findings.
Digging into the details: Uncovering 
a protein’s amino acid sequence
Once a pure sample of protein is available, it is possible to begin determining
its amino acid sequence, in order to identify the specific protein. The general

Chapter 5: Protein Structure and Function
 Is it possible to determine the sex, race,
and age of the source of the blood? Here
the answers become less precise. Clotting
and crystallization indicate age. Testing for
testosterone levels and chromosome test-
ing can determine sex. And certain contro-
versial, racial genetic markers based on
protein and enzyme tests may indicate
race.
Other body fluids may contain the same
antibodies and antigens found in blood.
Therefore, similar tests work on these fluids
as well.

procedure for doing so, with slight modification, works for other biochemicals
as well:
Step 1: Separating and purifying the polypeptide chains
If you determine that more than one polypeptide chain is present in the pro-
tein, you need to separate and purify the chains so you can sequence them
individually. (Because many proteins only have one polypeptide chain, this
step is not always necessary.) Denaturing the protein, disrupting its three-
dimensional structure without breaking the peptide bonds, using pH extremes
will normally suffice. If disulfide linkages are present between the chains,
apply the procedure outlined in Step 2 to separate the chains for isolation.
Step 2: Slashing intrachain disulfide linkages
Step 2 requires breaking (cleaving) the disulfide linkages. A simple reduction
accomplishes this. However, the linkages may reform later, so it is necessary
to cleave the linkages and prevent their reformation via reductive cleavage
followed by alkylation. Oxidative cleavage, where oxidation of the sulfur to
–SO3
– occurs, also prevents a reversal of the process.
Step 3: Determining amino acid concentration of the chain
Step 3 is easily accomplished using an amino acid analyzer, an automated
instrument that can determine the amino acid composition of a protein in
less than an hour. The instrument requires less than a nanomole of protein.
The analyzer’s output is the percentages of each of the amino acids present.
Step 4: Identifying the terminal amino acids
Step 4 not only identifies the terminal amino acids but also indicates whether
more than one chain is present. A polypeptide chain only has one N-terminal
and one C-terminal amino acid. Therefore, if more than one N- or C-terminal
amino acid is present, there must be more than one polypeptide chain.
It is possible to identify the N-terminal residue in a number of ways. In gen-
eral, procedures begin by adding a reagent that reacts with the N-terminal
amino acid and tags it. Subsequent hydrolysis destroys the polypeptide,
allowing separation of the tagged residue and its identification. Such methods
use Sanger’s reagent, dansyl chloride, and leucine aminopeptidase. The
method of choice nowadays is called the Edman degradation. This method,
as do other methods, tags the N-terminal residue; however, only the terminal
amino acid is cleaved from the chain, so the remainder of the chain is not
destroyed as in other methods. It is possible to repeat the procedure on the
shortened chain to determine the next residue. In principle, repetition of the
Edman degradation can yield the entire sequence, but, in most cases, deter-
mination of the first 30 to 60 residues is the limit.
80
Part II: The Meat of Biochemistry: Proteins 

It is also possible to determine the C-terminal residue by tagging. The akabori
reaction (hydrazinolysis) and reduction with lithium aluminum hydride tag
the C-terminal residue. It is also possible to selectively cleave the C-terminal
residue using the enzyme carboxypeptidase, a variety of which are available.
Unfortunately, the enzyme doesn’t stop with one cleavage — given sufficient
time, it proceeds down the entire polypeptide chain.
Steps 5 and 6: Breaking the chain into smaller pieces
In Step 5, you cleave the polypeptide into smaller fragments and determine
the amino acid composition and sequence of each fragment. Step 6 repeats
Step 5 using a different cleavage procedure to give a different set of fragments.
Steps 5 and 6 break the chain into smaller pieces to ease identification.
Most of the methods here employ enzymes; however, other less-specific
methods are useful in some cases. Partial acid hydrolysis randomly cleaves
the protein chain into a number of fragments. Trypsin, a digestive enzyme,
specifically cleaves on the C-side of arginine or lysine. Using trypsin gives
additional information that the total number of arginine and lysine residues
present is one less than the number of fragments generated. The digestive
enzyme chymotrypsin preferentially cleaves residues containing aromatic
rings (tyrosine, phenylalanine, and tryptophan). It slowly cleaves other
residues especially leucine. Clostripain cleaves positively charged amino
acids, especially arginine. It cleaves lysine more slowly. Fragments with a 
C-terminal aspartic acid or glutamic acid form from the interaction of staphy-
lococcal protease on a protein in a phosphate buffer. In the presence of bicar-
bonate or acetate buffer, only C-terminal glutamic acid fragments result. A
number of less specific enzymes can complete the breakdown of the fragments,
including elastase, subtilisin, thermolysin, pepsin, and papain.
Chemical methods of breaking up the fragments include treatment with
cyanogen bromide, hydroxylamine, and heating an acidic solution. Cyanogen
bromide specifically attacks methionine. Hydroxylamine specifically attacks
asparagine-glycine bonds. If a solution at pH = 2.5 is heated to 40°C, selective
cleavage of aspartic acid-proline bonds occurs.
It is possible to apply the Edman degradation on each of the fragments. This
can simplify the determination of the sequence of a large protein.
Step 7: Combining information to get the total sequence
Step 7 is where the information from the various procedures comes together.
For example, look at a simple octapeptide fragment from a protein. This frag-
ment gave, upon complete hydrolysis, one molecule each of alanine (Ala),
aspartic acid (Asp), glycine (Gly), lysine (Lys), phenylalanine (Phe), and valine
(Val), and two molecules of cysteine (Cys). The following fragments were 
81
Chapter 5: Protein Structure and Function

isolated after partial hydrolysis: Gly-Cys, Phe-Val-Gly, Cys-Asp, Cys-Ala, Lys-
Cys, and Cys-Asp-Lys. Now we match the fragments, deduce the amino acid
sequence in the octapeptide, and write a primary structure for the peptide:

Basics of blood typing
The determination of blood type in the A-B-O
system, first begun in 1901, is based on antigen-
antibody reactions. Over the years, additional
reactions have been discovered. More than 256
antigens are known, leading to 23 different
blood groups. Each blood group is defined by
the antibodies present in the serum and the
antigens present on the red blood cells.
In basic blood typing, one needs two antiserums,
labeled anti-A and anti-B. Adding a drop of one of
these to a blood sample causes coagulation if
the appropriate antigens are present. Anti-A
interacts with both A and AB blood. Anti-B inter-
acts with both B and AB blood. Neither interacts
with type O blood. The approximate distribution
of the different blood types is: 43–45 percent type
O; 40–42 percent type A; 10–12 percent B; and
3–5 percent AB. Subgrouping is also possible
with designations such as O1 and O2. There are
other very rare types as well.
The Rh factor provides an additional means of
subdividing blood. The Rh factor (the name
comes from the rhesus monkey) is an antigen
on the surface of red blood cells. A person with
a positive Rh factor contains a protein (anti-
body) that is also present in the bloodstream of
the rhesus monkey. About 85 percent humans
are Rh positive. A person lacking this protein is,
naturally, Rh negative. Assigning a blood
sample as Rh positive or Rh negative is a useful
simplification. There are about 30 possible com-
binations of factors. 
Additional factors can determine whether blood
belongs to a specific individual: the identifica-
tion of other proteins and enzymes present in
the blood. A forensic serologist (see this chap-
ter’s other sidebar for more) does this level of
testing in every case where the quality of the
sample allows. One of the characteristics of
proteins or enzymes in the blood is polymor-
phism, or the ability to be present as isoen-
zymes. Polymorphism means that the protein
may exist in different forms or variants. One
well-known example is the polymorphism of
hemoglobin into the form causing sickle cell
anemia. Some well-recognized polymorphisms
are:
Adenyl kinase

Adenosine deaminase

rows down the number of possible individuals.

Step 8: Locating the disulfide linkages
Step 8 does not specifically deal with the primary structure of the protein,
but it is related. If the disulfide linkages are left intact by skipping Step 2, dif-
ferent fragments result. x-ray diffraction analysis can locate each amino acid
residue. This can be used to determine the overall shape of a protein. In
some cases, more detailed structural information can be determined by
sophisticated instrumental analysis techniques.

nzymes are complex biological molecules, primarily or entirely protein,
which behave as biological catalysts. As catalysts, they alter the rate of 
a chemical reaction without themselves being consumed in the reaction.
Enzymes are normally very specific in their action, often targeting only one
specific reacting species, known as the substrate.
This specificity includes stereospecificity, the arrangement of the substrate
atoms in three-dimensional space. Stereospecificity is illustrated by the fact
that if the D-glucose in your diet were replaced by its enantiomer, L-glucose,
you would not be able to metabolize this otherwise identical enantiomer.
Enzymes occur in many forms. Some enzymes consist entirely of proteins,
whereas others have non-protein portions known as cofactors. The cofactor
may be a metal ion, such as magnesium, or an organic substance. We call an
organic cofactor a coenzyme (there is no specific term for a metallic cofactor).
An enzyme lacking its cofactor is an apoenzyme, and the combination of an
apoenzyme and its cofactor is a holoenzyme. A metalloenzyme contains 
an apoenzyme and a metal ion cofactor. A tightly bound coenzyme is a pros-
thetic group. (Wow! We know that this is a lot of terminology, but hang in there.
The key is the enzyme.)
One region on the enzyme, the active site, is directly responsible for interact-
ing with the reacting molecule(s). When a reacting molecule, the substrate,
binds to this active site, a reaction may occur. Other materials besides the
enzyme and substrate, may be necessary for the reaction to occur.

In many cases, the cell initially produces the enzyme in an inactive form called
a proenzyme or zymogen, which must undergo activation for it to function. The
enzyme trypsin illustrates why it is sometimes necessary to generate an inac-
tive form of an enzyme. Trypsin is one of the enzymes present in the stomach
that is responsible for the digestion of proteins. Its production, as an inactive
form, occurs in the cells of the stomach walls, and activation occurs after its
release into the stomach. If trypsin were produced in the active form, it would
immediately proceed to begin digesting the cell that produced it. Eating your-
self is not a good thing.
The activation of the inactive form of an enzyme serves as one form of enzyme
control. Inhibition is another method of enzyme control. The two general types
of inhibition are competitive inhibition and noncompetitive inhibition. In 
competitive inhibition, another species competes with the substrate to interact
with the active site on the enzyme. In noncompetitive inhibition, the other
species binds to some site other than the active site. This binding alters the
overall structure of the enzyme so that it no longer functions as a catalyst.
Enzyme Classification: The 
Best Catalyst for the Job
Ever wonder who gets to name chemicals? Well, the answer varies, but 
for enzymes it’s the Enzyme Commission of the International Union of
Biochemistry that’s responsible. Common names for enzymes begin with
some description of its action plus an -ase suffix. (Enzymes that were named
before the implementation of the -ase system, such as trypsin, do not follow
this convention.) The Enzyme Commission has also developed a numerical
system for classifying enzymes. The names begin with EC, for Enzyme
Commission, and end with four numbers, separated by decimal points,
describing the enzyme. An example of this nomenclature is EC 2.7.4.4. 
The first number in the EC name refers to the major enzyme class, and there
are six major enzyme classes, summarized in Table 6-1. To continue with our
example, the 2 in EC 2.7.4.4 designates the enzyme as a transferase. The
second number, the 7, indicates what group the enzyme transfers. The third
number, the first 4, indicates the destination of the transferred group. And the
last number, the second 4, refines the information given by the third number.

Oxidoreductases catalyze a simultaneous oxidation and a reduction. An 
oxidation involves the increase in the oxidation state of an element, whereas
a reduction involves the decrease in the oxidation state of an element. It is
impossible to have one without the other. Examples of the types of reactions
that qualify as oxidation and reduction reactions are in Table 6-2. In general,
the substrate undergoes either oxidation or reduction, while the enzyme tem-
porarily does the opposite but eventually returns to its original form.

removes two hydrogen atoms from an alcohol to produce an aldehyde. The
general form, unbalanced, of these reactions is as follows:
You don’t belong here: Transferases
The purpose of a transferase is to catalyze the transfer of a group from one
molecule to another. Aminotransferase transfers an amino group, and phos-
photransferase transfers a phosphoryl group. The general form, unbalanced,
of these reactions appears in Figure 6-1.
Water does it again: Hydrolases
Hydrolases catalyze the cleavage of a bond through the insertion of a water
molecule (as an H and an OH). There may be a pH dependence, which results
in the subsequent loss of a hydrogen ion. A phosphatase catalyzes the hydrol-
ysis of a monophosphate ester, and a peptidase catalyzes the hydrolysis of a
peptide bond. The general form of these reactions appears in Figure 6-2.

Shuffling the deck: Isomerases
Racemase and epimerase are isomerases. Isomerase enzymes catalyze the
conversion of one isomer to another. The racemase illustrated at the top of
Figure 6-4 catalyzes the racemization of enantiomers. An epimerase, like the
one at the bottom of Figure 6-4, catalizes the change of one epimer to
another. Like all catalyzed reactions, these are equilibrium processes.
Putting it together: Ligases
Ligase enzymes catalyze reactions leading to the joining of two molecules in
which a covalent bond forms between the two molecules. The process often
utilizes high-energy bonds such as in ATP. Figure 6-5 illustrates the action 
of two ligases, pyruvate carboxylase and acetyl-CoA synthetase. Pyruvate
carboxylase catalyzes the formation of a C-C bond. Acetyl-CoA synthetase
catalyzes the formation of a C-S bond.

Enzymes as Catalysts: When 
Fast Is Not Fast Enough
The action of an enzyme begins with the formation of an enzyme-substrate
complex. In this formation, the substrate in some way binds to the active site
of the enzyme. The interaction between the enzyme and the substrate must,
in some way, facilitate the reaction, and it opens a new reaction pathway.
The active site is typically a very small part of the overall enzyme structure.
The amino acid residues comprising the active site may come from widely
separated regions of the protein (primary structure), and it is only through
interactions leading to higher structure levels that they are brought close
together. Amino acid residues not in the active site serve many different 
functions that aid the function of the enzyme. 
Models of catalysis: Lock and 
key versus induced-fit
The first attempt at explaining this process led to the Lock and Key Model,
in which the substrate behaves as a key that fits into a lock, the enzyme
(Figure 6-6). The Lock and Key Model, to a certain degree, explains the speci-
ficity of enzymes. Just as only the right key will fit into a lock, only the right
substrate fits into the enzyme.

Chapter 6: Enzymes Kinetics: Getting There Faster

One limitation of the Lock and Key Model is that it does not explain why the
reaction actually occurs, and another is that enzymes are flexible and not
rigid as this theory implies.
The Induced-Fit Model overcomes some of the limitations of the Lock and Key
Model. In this model, the substrate still needs to fit into the enzyme like a
key, but instead of simply fitting into the “keyhole,” some type of modification
is induced in the substrate, enzyme, or both. The modification begins the
process of the reaction. Figure 6-7 illustrates how the Induced-Fit Model
applies to the formation of the same enzyme-substrate in Figure 6-6. 
All About Kinetics
As you know, all reactions involve energy. The reactants begin with a certain
level of energy, an additional quantity of energy is absorbed to reach the tran-
sition state (∆G*, where the asterisk indicates the transition state), and then
energy is released to reach the products. The difference in the energy
between the reactants and products is ∆G.
If the energy level of the products is greater than that of the reactants (energy
is absorbed), the reaction is endergonic, and nonspontaneous. If the energy
level of the products is less than the reactants (energy is released), the
process is exergonic, and spontaneous.

But just because a reaction is spontaneous does not mean it will occur at an
appreciable rate. The rate depends on the value of ∆G*. The greater the value
of ∆G*, the slower the reaction is. An enzyme, like any catalyst, lowers the
value of ∆G* and consequently increases the rate of the reaction. The differ-
ence between the reactants and products remains unchanged, as does the
equilibrium distribution of the reactants and products. The enzyme facili-
tates the formation of the transition state (Figure 6-8).

Chapter 6: Enzymes Kinetics: Getting There Faster

A species has two possible fates in the transition state: It may lose energy and
return to the reactant form, or it may lose energy and move to the product
form. These two fates lead to two equilibria. One of the equilibria involves 
the reactant (substrate) and the transition state, and the other involves the
product(s) and the transition state. Rapid removal of the product(s) does 
not allow establishment of the reverse process that leads to the equilibrium.
Removal of the product simplifies the analysis of the kinetic data.
Enzymes, like all catalysts, catalyze both the forward and the reverse reac-
tion. The lowering of ∆G* accelerates both reactions. The ultimate equilib-
rium concentrations of substrate and products will be the same whether an
enzyme is present or not — the enzyme merely changes the amount of time
necessary to reach this state.
Enzyme assays: Fixed time and kinetic
An enzyme assay is an experiment to determine the catalytic activity of an
enzyme. It is possible to measure either the rate of disappearance of the sub-
strate or the rate of appearance of a product. The experimental mode of
detection depends on the particular chemical and physical properties of the
substrate or the product, and the rate is the change in concentration per
change in time. In fixed time assay, you simply measure the amount of reac-
tion in a fixed amount of time. In kinetic assay, you monitor the progress of a
reaction continuously. Once you determine the rate of change in concentra-
tion of any reactant or product, it is possible to determine the rate of change
of for any other reactant or product of the reaction
It is important to control the conditions precisely. Minor changes in variables
such as the temperature or the pH can drastically alter the catalytic activity
of an enzyme. For example, the study of enzymes important to humans
should be carried out at 37°C, because this is normal body temperature.
Rate determination: How fast is fast? 
It is important to control kinetic experiments closely. Once you determine the
basic conditions, you can run a series of experiments using a fixed enzyme
concentration and varying concentrations of substrate. Up to a point, an
increase in substrate concentration results in an increase in rate. The 
rate increases until the enzyme is saturated. This saturation point is where 
all the enzyme molecules are part of an enzyme-substrate complex. When
this occurs, an increase in the substrate concentration yields no increase 
in the rate, because there are no enzymes available to interact with the 
94
Part II: The Meat of Biochemistry: Proteins 

additional substrate molecules. For most reactions, the rate of the reaction
approaches the saturation level along a hyperbolic curve. Theoretically, the
reaction rate will only reach saturation at infinite substrate concentration.
A plot of the reaction rate, V, versus the substrate concentration, [substrate],
supplies several bits of useful data (see Figure 6-9). The experiment is at con-
stant enzyme concentration. One piece of useful data is the maximum reac-
tion rate, Vmax. The rate approaches Vmax asymptotically. At low substrate
concentrations, the reaction approaches first-order kinetics, where the rate
of reaction depends only on the concentration of one reactant. At high con-
centrations, the reaction approaches zero-order kinetics, where the rate of
reaction is independent of reactant concentration. (Later in this chapter you
will see that this graph varies with less simple enzyme-substrate interac-
tions.) In the region between the zero-order region and the first-order region,
the kinetics are mixed and difficult to interpret. Important values in the low-
concentration region (first-order region) are 1⁄2 Vmax and KM. The value 1⁄2 Vmax is
one-half the Vmax value. KM is the Michaelis constant, which corresponds to
the substrate concentration producing a rate of 1⁄2 Vmax. The Michaelis con-
stant, measured in terms of molarity, is a rough measure of the enzyme-
substrate affinity. KM values vary widely.

Chapter 6: Enzymes Kinetics: Getting There Faster
Enzymes in medical diagnosis and treatment
Enzyme levels may indicate medical problems,
and that makes enzyme assays useful for both
the diagnosis and treatment of medical prob-
lems. For examine, creatine kinese (CK) is an
enzyme that aids in the synthesis and degrada-
tion of creatine phosphate.
CK exists as three different isoenzymes. Each is
composed of two polypeptide chains. In the
case of muscle CK, the chains are identical, and
it’s labeled CK-MM. CK found in the brain also
has identical polypeptide chains, but they are
different from the ones associated with muscle
CK and are labeled CK-BB. Finally, the CK found
in the heart is a hybrid of the two with one M
chain and one B chain: CK-MB.
Normal blood serum contains a little CK-MM
and almost no CK-BB and CK-MB. When tissue
undergoes injury, though, some of the intracel-
lular enzymes leak into the blood where they
can be measured. Elevated levels of total CK (all
three isoenzymes) may be indicative of sketal-
muscle trauma or myocardial infarction (MI, or
heart attack). Analysis of the individual isoen-
zymes may give additional clues.
For example, an individual falls off a ladder and
suffers several broken bones. He is taken to the
hospital, where his blood serum CK is mea-
sured. It is elevated as expected, but the physi-
cian also orders a CK-MB level determination.
It turns out to also be highly elevated, indicating
that the reason the man fell off the latter to
begin with was that he was suffering a heart
attack (CK-MB). This knowledge allows the
doctor to start a regime of treatment that helps
to minimize permanent heart damage.

At low substrate concentrations, there is an approximately linear relationship
between [substrate] and V. At high substrate concentrations, though, V is
nearly independent of [substrate]. The low substrate region is useful in the
application of the Michaelis-Menten equation (see the next section).
In an uncatalyzed reaction, increasing the substrate concentration does not
lead to a limiting Vmax. The rate continues to increase with increasing sub-
strate concentration. This indirect evidence leads to the conclusion that
there is an enzyme-substrate complex, a tightly-bound grouping of the enzyme
and the substrate. The limit occurs when all the enzyme molecules are part
of a complex so that there are no free enzyme molecules available to accom-
modate the additional substrate molecules. Various x-ray and spectroscopic
techniques provide direct evidence to confirm the formation of an enzyme-
substrate complex.
Measuring Enzyme Behavior: The
Michaelis-Menten Equation
One of the breakthroughs in the study of enzyme kinetics was the develop-
ment of the Michaelis-Menten equation. It is possible to interpret the behav-
ior of many enzymes by applying the equation to kinetic data. (There are
exceptions, and they do not give a graph similar to the one appearing back in

Figure 6-9.) In general, the results of the kinetics experiments are for allosteric
enzymes. The Michaelis-Menten equation is as follows:
In this equation, V is the rate of the reaction, [S] is the substrate concentra-
tion, Vmax is the maximum reaction rate, and KM is the Michaelis constant. As
seen in Figure 6-9, the rate of catalysis, V, increases linearly at low substrate
concentration, but begins to level off at higher concentrations. Interpretation
begins with examining the following general reaction pathway:
In this pathway, E refers to the enzyme, S is the substrate, ES is the enzyme-
substrate complex, and P is the product. The various instances of k refer to
the rate constants of the various steps — a negative rate constant is for the
reverse process. In the first step, the separate enzyme and substrate combine
to form the enzyme-substrate complex (transition state). The rate of forma-
tion of ES is k1. After ES forms, it may break down to E and S (k-1) or it may
proceed to product (k2). (Note: Some texts refer to k2 as kcat.)
Because the enzyme will catalyze the reverse process, E and P may combine
to reform the complex (k-2). Ignoring the reverse reaction (k-2) simplifies the
interpretation of the data. This is not an unreasonable assumption if data col-
lection is near the beginning of the reaction, where the concentration of P is
low. The assumption that k-2 is negligible leads to a simplification of the pre-
ceding equation to:
Through this simplification, the chemists Leonor Michaelis and Maud Menten
were able to propose a model that explains the kinetics of many different
enzymes. Through their work, an expression relating the catalytic rate to the
concentrations of the enzyme and substrate and to the individual rates was
developed. The starting point for this expression is the relationship between
the rate of the reaction and the concentration of the enzyme-substrate 
complex:

Similarly, the rate of formation of ES is k1[E] [S], and the rate for the breakdown
of ES is (k-1 + k2) [ES]. Throughout most of the reaction, the concentration of ES
remains nearly constant. This is the steady-state assumption, which assumes
that during a reaction the concentrations of any intermediates remain nearly
constant. This assumption means that the rate of formation of ES must be
equal to the rate of breakdown of ES, or:
This equation rearranges to:
The combination of the three rate constants yields a new constant: the
Michaelis constant, KM, which is independent of the enzyme and substrate
concentrations and is an important characteristic of enzyme-substrate 
interactions. Using the Michaelis constant, the concentration of ES is:
When the enzyme concentration is much lower than the substrate concentra-
tion, the value of [S] is very close to the total substrate concentration. The
enzyme concentration, [E], is equal to the total enzyme concentration, [E]T,
minus the concentration of the enzyme-substrate complex, or [E] = [E]T – [ES].

Rearranging this equation gives:
Substituting this relationship into V = k2[ES] or (V = kcat[ES]) gives:
The maximum rate, Vmax, occurs when all the enzyme molecules are associ-
ated with substrate. That is, [ES] = [E]T. This changes V = k2[ES] to Vmax =
k2[ES]T. This relationship changes the preceding equation to the Michaelis-
Menten equation:
This equation accounts for the information depicted in Figure 6-9. At very low
concentrations, [S] << KM, we see V = (Vmax / KM) / [S], and when [S] is greater
than KM (high [S]), V = Vmax. When [S] = KM it leads to V = Vmax / 2.
Ideal applications
The Michaelis-Menten equation explains the behavior of many enzymes. It is
relatively easy to determine both the KM and Vmax values, and this is normally
done graphically using computer programs that generate the best-fit curve.
The KM values vary widely. The value depends on the identity of the substrate
and on a variety of environmental factors such as temperature, ionic
strength, and pH. Because KM indicates the substrate concentration required

to fill half of the active sites on the enzyme, it gives an indication of the mini-
mum substrate concentration for significant catalytic activity to occur. It is
possible to determine the fraction of sites filled, fES, from the value of KM:
KM also gives information about the rate constants for the reaction.
In the special case where k-1 is significantly greater than k2, KM = k-1 / k1, which
relates to the equilibrium constant for the dissociation of the enzyme-
substrate complex:
Under these special conditions, KM is a measure of the binding in the enzyme-
substrate complex. A high KM value indicates that the binding is weak, whereas
a low value indicates that the binding is strong.
Don’t forget: These conclusions only apply under the special conditions of 
k-1 >> k2.
The value of Vmax supplies the turnover number of the enzyme. The turnover
number gives the number of substrate molecules transforming to products
per unit of time for a fully saturated enzyme. You can determine k2 from this
value. (The constant k2 is also known as the catalytic constant, kcat.) If the
concentration of active sites, [E]T, is known, this relationship applies:

Realistic applications
The ideas in the preceding section provide useful information about the
behavior of many enzymes. In cells, however, the enzymes are seldom satu-
rated with substrate. Under typical conditions [S] / KM is usually between 1.0
and 0.01. If KM is much greater than [S], the catalytic rate kcat (or k2) is signifi-
cantly less than the ideal value because only a small portion of the active
sites contain substrate. The ratio kcat / KM allows you to compare the sub-
strate preferences of an enzyme.
The maximum rate of catalytic activity is limited by the rate of diffusion to
bring the enzyme and substrate together. Some enzymes can exceed this limit
by forming assemblages. In these groups, the product of one enzyme is the
substrate for a closely associated enzyme. This allows a substrate to enter
the group and pass from enzyme to enzyme as if it were in an assembly line. 
Another complication is that many enzymes require more than one substrate.
It is possible to utilize these multiple substrates through sequential displace-
ment or through double displacement. In sequential displacement, all sub-
strates must simultaneously bind to the enzyme before the release of the
product. In this type of displacement, the order in which the substrates bind
is unimportant. In double displacement, or ping-pong, situations, one or more
products leave before all the substrates bind. Double displacement mecha-
nisms temporarily modify the enzyme.
Here we go again: Lineweaver-Burk plots
Once upon a time, before the invention of computers, the determination of 
KM and Vmax was a tedious process. Today curve-fitting programs allow rapid
analysis of the data to determine these values. However, a relatively simple
method allows a relatively accurate determination of these two constants.
This method is to construct a Lineweaver-Burk plot, also known as a double-
reciprocal plot. The basis of a Lineweaver-Burk plot comes from the manipula-
tion of the Michaelis-Menten equation to the form:
This equation has the form y = mx + b, and describes a straight line. A plot of
the reciprocal of the rate, 1 / V, versus the reciprocal of the substrate concen-
tration, 1 / [S], gives a line with a y-intercept equal to 1 / Vmax and an x-intercept
of –1 / KM. An example of this type of plot appears in Figure 6-10.

Plotting V versus V / [S] gives a straight-line.
Enzyme Inhibition: Slowing It Down
Inibitors are substances that decrease the activity of an enzyme, and they
come in two general classes: competitive inhibitors, which compete with the
substrate, and noncompetitive inhibitors, which do not compete. (Mixed inhi-
bition has characteristics of both competitive and noncompetitive inhibition.)
In general, these processes are reversible, but there are also irreversible inhib-
iters that permanently alter the enzyme or bind very strongly to the enzyme.
All inhibition may serve as a method of regulating enzymatic activity. There
are also many medical applications of this form of inhibition. Examples
include anti-epileptic and chemotherapy drugs, along with the ever-popular
Viagra. The action of many poisons is also through inhibition.

Chapter 6: Enzymes Kinetics: Getting There Faster

Competititive inhibition
A competitive inhibitor enters the active site of an enzyme and, thus, pre-
vents the substrate from entering. This prevention results in a decrease in
the number of enzyme-substrate complexes that form, and, hence, a decrease
in the rate of catalysis. In most cases, a portion of the inhibitor mimics a por-
tion of the substrate. An increase in the substrate concentration overcomes
this inhibition because of the increased probability of a substrate molecule
entering the active site than an inhibitor molecule. 
Noncompetitive inhibition
Noncompetitive inhibitors do not enter the active site but instead bind to
some other region of the enzyme. These species usually do not mimic the
substrate. This type of inhibitor reduces the turnover number of the enzyme.
Unlike competitive inhibition, an increase in the substrate does not overcome
noncompetitive inhibition. This type of inhibition takes many different forms,
so there is no simple model.
Graphing inhibition
Lineweaver-Burk plots are useful in the study of enzyme inhibition. Figures
6-13 and 6-14 illustrate how the graph changes in the presence of a noncom-
petitive and a competitive inhibitor. The plot of enzyme inhibition allows us
to quickly determine the type of inhibition. In noncompetitive enzyme inhibi-
tion, the value of KM remains unchanged. In competitive inhibition, however,
it is 1/Vmax that remains unchanged.
Enzyme Regulation
In general, an increase in the concentration of a substrate, if unregulated, will
induce an increase in the rate of reaction. An increase in the concentration of
a product will, in general, have the reverse effect. Product regulation is a type
of feedback control. In many cases, it is necessary to regulate the activity of
enzymes more precisely. There are four general types of enzyme regulation:
 Allosteric control
 Multiple enzyme forms
 Covalent modification
 Proteolytic activation

Chapter 6: Enzymes Kinetics: Getting There Faster

Allosteric control
An allosterically regulated enzyme has a regulatory site. When a small mole-
cule, called a regulator, binds to the regulatory site, it induces a conforma-
tional change in the enzyme, making it into its active form.
Multiple enzyme forms
Some enzymes have multiple forms known as isozymes or isoenzymes. There
are slight differences in the structures of the forms. These differences lead to
differences in the KM and Vmax values, and, therefore, in the general activity.
Covalent modification
In this form of regulation, the attachment of a group, often a phosphoryl group,
alters the activity of the enzyme. This process is a reversible form of control.
Protein kinases catalyze this type of activation, whereas other enzymes cat-
alyze deactivation.
Proteolytic activation
In this form of regulation, an inactive form of an enzyme — a proenzyme or a
zymogen — often undergoes irreversible conversion to the active form, often
through the hydrolysis of one or more peptide bonds.

Where the money is: Enzymes and industry
The industrial implementation of enzymes origi-
nated from studies in the food, wine, and beer
industries. Scientists, such as Louis Pasteur, laid
much of the groundwork for these applications. 
Many of the applications of enzymes to industry
involve immobilized enzymes. An immobilized
enzyme is covalently bonded to an insoluble
matrix such as cellulose or glass beads. The
immobilization of an enzyme stabilizes it and
allows prolonged use. Some useful commercial
enzymes are as follows:

What We Crave: Carbohydrates
In This Chapter
 Finding out about carbohydrates
 Checking out monosaccharides
 Reviewing oligosaccharides
A
dmit it: You love your carbohydrates. From simple sugars to complex
carbohydrates, a day without carbs is a boring day. And carbs are plen-
tiful: In terms of mass, carbohydrates are the most abundant biochemical.
Carbohydrates are a product of photosynthesis, where inorganic carbon diox-
ide becomes organic carbon with the utilization of solar energy, accompanied
by the release of oxygen gas. The conversion of solar energy to chemical
energy produces carbohydrates, which are the primary energy source for
metabolic processes. Carbs are not only an important energy source but also
are the raw materials for the synthesis of other biochemicals. They have
structural uses and are a component of nucleic acids.
The term carbohydrate originally referred to “hydrates of carbon” because
the general formula of these compounds was CnH2nOn or Cn(H2O)n. However,
some materials with this general formula are not carbohydrates, and some
carbohydrates do not have this general formula. It is better (though not
much more conversational) to define carbohydrates as polyhydroxyaldehydes
and polyhydroxyketones and their derivatives.
Natural carbohydrates are subdivided into monosaccharides, or simple sugars
containing three to nine carbon atoms, polysaccharides, or polymers of mono-
saccharides, and an intermediate category of oligosaccharides, with two 
to ten monosaccharide units joined. The most important oligosaccharides to
humans economically and biologically are the disaccharrides.

Properties of Carbohydrates
In general, the names of most carbohydrates are recognizable by an -ose suffix.
An aldose, for example, is a monosaccharide where the carbonyl group is an
aldehyde, whereas in a ketose the carbonyl group is a ketone. Chemists also
use roots referring to the number of carbon atoms. Pentoses, five-carbon
atoms, and hexoses, six-carbon atoms, are very important. Trioses, tetroses,
and so on are also found in nature. It is possible to combine these generic
names to give terms such as aldohexose and ketopentose.
They contain one or more chiral carbons
Chiral carbons are those that have four different groups, atoms or groups of
atoms, attached to them. Most carbohydrates contain one or more chiral 
carbons. For this reason, they are optically active, rotating polarized light in
different directions and many times having different activity in biological sys-
tems. Fischer projections are useful in indicating the asymmetry around each
of the chiral carbon atoms. Figure 7-1 illustrates the construction of a Fischer
projection. In the Fischer projection, the vertical lines project back, and the
horizontal lines project forward. There are two arrangements of groups
around a chiral center: These arrangements are called enantiomers and repre-
sent nonsuperimposable mirror images, like left and right gloves. The enan-
tiomers comprise a D/L pair, where the D form rotates polarized light to the
right, and the L form rotates polarized light to the left.
Fischer projections are not only useful for representing chiral carbons, but
they are useful in identifying which enantiomeric form is present in a sample.
To determine whether two projections are enantiomers or just simply two
representations of the same molecule, it is necessary to compare the 
or
Figure 7-1:

the three-
dimensional
structure
and the

projection. 
112
Part III: Carbohydrates, Lipids, Nucleic Acids, and More 

two drawings. During this comparison, rotate one of the projections by 180°
about an axis perpendicular to the plane of the paper (in other words, turn
the paper while it’s lying on a table). If the diagrams are identical after this
rotation, then they are simply two representations of the same molecule. If
the diagrams are not identical, they represent a pair of enantiomers.
They have multiple chiral centers
Because many carbohydrates have more than one chiral center (more than
one chiral carbon), there can be more than two stereoisomers. The number
of stereoisomers is 2n, where n is the number of chiral carbons. For example,
if the compound has two chiral carbons, there are a total of four stereoiso-
mers — two pairs of enantiomers. Although the members of each pair are
enantiomers, members of the different pairs are referred to as diastereomers.
The structure for D-glucose, a typical monosaccharide, appears in Figure 7-2.
In this figure (a Fischer projection), all the carbon atoms except the ones at
the top and bottom are chiral — a common way of representing monosaccha-
rides. The carbon atoms appear as a vertical chain with the carbonyl carbon
as near the top as possible (it is at the top for an aldose). Numbering the
carbon atoms begins at the top, as indicated with the top carbon labeled C1.
The highest-numbered chiral carbon in this case is number five. By conven-
tion, if the –OH on this carbon atom appears on the right, it’s the D form of
the monosaccharide; if it is on the left, it’s the L form.

Chapter 7: What We Crave: Carbohydrates

Any change in the relative positions of the groups attached about any of the
chiral carbon atoms in a Fischer projection produces either a different enan-
tiomer or a diastereomer (assuming that the result is not simply a different
way of drawing the original structure). In the case of D-glucose, with 4 chiral
centers, there are 16 structures. One is D-glucose, and another is its enan-
tiomer: L-glucose. The remaining 14 structures are diastereomers consisting
of 7 enantiomeric pairs. Each of the enantiomeric pairs consists of a different
monosaccharide. In the case of glucose, you have glucose, allose, altrose,
mannose, gulose, idose, galactose, and talose, shown in Figure 7-3. The 
different D-ketohexoses are in Figure 7-4.
A Sweet Topic: Monosaccharides
The monosaccharides, or simple sugars, are an important class of biochemi-
cals. For example, glucose, one of the most common monosaccharides, is 
the primary form of energy storage in the body. Most monosaccharides taste
sweet. The relatively large number of hydroxyl groups and the polar carbonyl
group mean that most of these compounds are water-soluble. And, as men-
tioned earlier, most are optically active.
The most stable monosaccharide structures:
Pyranose and furanose forms
The most important monosaccharide is D-glucose (one form of D-glucose
appears back in Figure 7-2). This form exists in equilibrium with two slightly
different ring forms. The ring form results from an internal cyclization reac-
tion, where a two groups on the same molecule join forming a ring. (The rings
appear as planar structures even though the actual structures are not planar.)
This cyclization involves a reaction between the carbonyl group and the high-
est-numbered chiral carbon, producing one of the following structures: a
hemiacetal, an acetal, a hemiketal, or a ketal. In the case of D-glucose a pyra-
nose ring forms. Haworth projection formulas are useful when representing
the ring forms of a monosaccharide (Figure 7-5).

Chapter 7: What We Crave: Carbohydrates

There are two possible structures for the pyranose structure of D-glucose
(see Figure 7-6), and other monosaccharides. If we examine the Fischer 
projection for D-glucose, we can see why:
 Structure 1: Hydroxyl group on one carbon in the up position.
 Structure 2: Hydroxyl group on the corresponding carbon in the down
position.
If you “bend” the carbonyl group around and then allow a reaction with the
highest numbered chiral carbon, you have two choices: right or left. This
gives two forms known as anomers. The anomers are labeled α and β. The
carbonyl carbon — C1, in this case – is the anomeric carbon, which should be
on the right side of a Haworth projection. The relative positions of –H and
–OH about the anomeric carbon determine whether it is the α or β form. The
hydroxyl group points down in the α form, and the hydroxyl group points up
in the β form. (Reversing the drawing of the rings may give a structure with
the opposite orientation of the groups about the anomeric carbon.) In solu-
tion, each of the anomers is in equilibrium with the open chain form repre-
sented by the Fischer projection. Therefore, there is an interconversion
between the α and β forms known as mutarotation.
It is also possible to form a five-membered ring, called a furanose ring. A sim-
plified furanose structure appears in Figure 7-7. Ribose is an example of a
monosaccharide that may form a furanose ring.

The pyranose and furanose forms are the thermodynamically more stable
forms of the monosaccharides. In general, in the equilibria involving ring 
and open forms, less than ten percent of the molecules are in the open form.
Fructose is a ketose that may form a furanose ring. Structures of D-fructose
are shown in Figure 7-8.
Chemical properties of monosaccharides
Many aldoses, because of the aldehyde group, are reducing sugars — that is,
they are reducing agents in certain redox reactions. A number of tests for
reducing sugars, include using Fehling’s solution or Benedict’s solution. 
These tests are useful to check for glucose in the urine of a diabetic.
The reaction of a monosaccharide with methanol, CH3OH, in the presence of
hydrochloric acid, HCl, replaces the hydrogen atom of the hydroxyl group on
C1 with a methyl group, forming a glycosidic bond. (Nitrogen may also be part
of a glycosidic bond.) Once the glycoside forms, the ring is “locked,” meaning
it will not reopen; therefore, mutarotation will no longer take place. A formerly
reducing sugar will no longer be a reducing sugar.

Derivatives of the monosaccharides
A variety of derivatives of the monosaccharides are formed through the
alteration of one or more of the functional groups present. In this section we
examine some of these derivatives using D-ribose as the parent monosaccha-
ride. Two forms of the structure of D-ribose appear in Figure 7-9.
The reduction of the carbonyl group to an alcohol yields a reduced sugar
(polyhydric alcohol). The reduction of D-ribose forms D-ribitol (Figure 7-10).

It is also possible to oxidize a monosaccharide to a carboxylic acid. There are
two important oxidations: oxidation of an aldehyde (aldose) to an aldonic
acid, and oxidation of the alcohol on the highest-numbered carbon atom to 
a uronic acid. In the case of D-ribose, it is possible to form D-ribonic acid
(Figure 7-11) or D-ribouronic acid (Figure 7-12).
Monosaccharides, like all alcohols, may react with acids to form esters. The
combination with phosphoric acid (phosphate sugar) is a biologically impor-
tant reaction. Any of the alcohol groups may react. Figure 7-13 shows one
example: D-ribose-1-phosphate. (The “1” refers to the attachment of the 
phosphate group to C1.)

The most common monosaccharides
Glucose, or blood sugar, is also known as dextrose. The anomeric carbon is
part of a hemiacetal, and the name of the pyranose structure is glucopyranose.
Blood is commonly tested for blood glucose levels, which are controlled by
the hormone insulin, produced within the body in the pancreas. In a healthy
human, blood glucose levels rise slightly after eating. The pancreas then
releases insulin in order to keep the levels from rising too high. A healthy
individual has a fasting blood sugar of 70–99 milligrams of glucose per
deciliter of blood and 70–145 mg/dL two hours after eating. The American
Diabetes Association associates blood glucose levels of 126 mg/dL (fasting)
or 200 mg/dL (two hours after eating) with diabetes — the inability of the 
pancreas to produce enough insulin.
The simplest aldose is glyceraldehyde, and the simplest ketose is dihydroxy
acetone. Figure 7-14 shows the structures of these two compounds.

The beginning of life: Ribose 
and deoxyribose
The monosaccharides D-ribose and D-deoxyribose are important components
of the nucleic acids. They are present in these complex molecules in the form
of a furanose ring. In addition, they are present as the β anomer. The difference
between these two monosaccharides is that there is one less oxygen atom pre-
sent in deoxyribose, hence the “deoxy.” The “missing” oxygen atom is at C2.
The structures of these two sugars appear in Figure 7-15.
Sugars Joining Hands: Oligosaccharides
The joining of two or more monosaccharides forms an oligosaccharide, with
two to ten monosaccharide units, or a polysaccharide, a polymer having many
more monosaccharide units. One or more glycoside linkages hold the mono-
saccharides together. The simplest, and most common, oligosaccharides are
the disaccharides.

Keeping it simple: Disaccharides
A disaccharide is an oligosaccharide composed of two monosaccharide units.
The best-known disaccharide (and surely the most well liked) is probably
sucrose, which you know as table sugar or cane sugar. Each molecule of this
sugar is a combination of a glucose molecule and a fructose molecule. There
are many other important disaccharides — among them, maltose, malt sugar,
and lactose, milk sugar, each of which contains two molecules of glucose.
Due to its simplicity,where two identical monosaccharides are joined, we will
use maltose to illustrate several points concerning disaccharides, and, by
implication, other oligosaccharides and polysaccharides. The structure of
maltose appears in Figure 7-16.
The oxygen atom joining the two glucose rings of the maltose molecule in
Figure 7-16 is a glycoside linkage — an α(1-4) linkage. The α refers to the
anomeric form of the ring on the left. If β-D-glucose were present instead,
then lactose would result (see Figure 7-17). The 1-4 indicates that C1 of the
left ring links to C4 of the right ring. The loss of a water molecule accompa-
nies the formation of the linkage, which locks the left ring so that mutarota-
tion is no longer possible. The locked ring is also no longer a reducing sugar.
But mutarotation can still occur on the right ring.

Sucrose, table sugar, is a disaccharide like maltose. It forms when D-glucose
links to a D-fructose by a α(1-2) linkage. This situation locks both rings so
that mutarotation of neither ring can occur. The formation of sucrose appears
in Figure 7-18.
If the sweetness of sucrose is 100, then the sweetness level of glucose is 74,
and that of fructose, 173. Fructose, found in corn syrup, is the sweetest
common sugar — meaning you need less of it to make foods taste sweet. Less
sugar translates to fewer calories. There are also naturally occurring, sweet-
tasting proteins, some of which are hundreds of times sweeter than sugar.
Quite a few artificial sweeteners are used in commercial products. The best
known are saccharin (about 500 times as sweet as sucrose, aspartame (200
times as sweet as sucrose), and sucralose (marketed as Splenda) — which is 
a whopping 600 times as sweet as sucrose. Sucralose is created by replacing
three of the hydroxyl groups of sucrose with chlorines.

Starch and cellulose: Polysaccharides
The two most important polysaccharides are starch and cellulose. Both of
these are polymers of D-glucose. The basic difference between these two
polymers is the linkages between the glucose units. Starch is related to mal-
tose and cellulose is related to lactose.
Bread, pasta, and potatoes: Starches
Of all the carbohydrates, we think starches are our favorite. Bring on the
potatoes and pastas! The different types of these lovely, delicious polysac-
charides are very closely related by the linkages between their monomer
units. Starch is a polymer of α-D-glucose. There are three common types of
starch: amylase, amylopectin, and glycogen. Amylase is the combination 
of α(1-4) glucose groups. Amylopectin, like amylase, has α((1-4) glucose link-
ages, but, in addition, it has α((1-6) branches. Glycogen, animal starch, is sim-
ilar to amylopectin except that it has more branches. All three are useful in
storing glucose, and all three give an intense dark blue color in the presence
of iodine — a simple and useful test.
Keeping the termites happy: Cellulose
Ever wonder why you can eat a potato but not a tree? Cellulose is similar to
starch except that the linkages are β(1-4) glucose. The primary use of cellu-
lose in nature is structure. Cleavage of the linkages is only possible with
enzymes produced by certain bacteria or fungi. For this reason, only certain
creatures, such as termites, and ruminants like cows, who have these bacte-
ria in their GI tracts, can digest and utilize cellulose as an energy source.
Cellulose is one of the most abundant biochemicals on earth.
Biological connective tissue: Acidic polysaccharides 
One of the major uses of polysaccharies in the body is the area of connective
tissues, the compounds that hold our parts together. This group of tissue
includes tendons, ligaments, and collagen. (Fuller lips, anyone?) Acidic poly-
saccharides are important to the structure and function of connective tissue.
The repeating units of these polysaccharide derivatives are disaccharides.
One of the components of the disaccharide is an amino sugar (where an
amino group substitutes for an alcohol group). One or both of the compo-
nents of the disaccharide unit have a negatively charged group (either a 
sulfate or a carboxylate). Examples are hyaluronic acid and heparin. The
hyaluronate and heparin repeating units appear in Figure 7-19.
Heparin is used to treat and prevent blood clots from forming, especially in
the lungs and legs. It is commonly used after dialysis, after surgery or when
the patient has been unable to move for extended periods of time. It acts as
an anticoagulant by binding to one of the anti-clotting proteins, increasing its
efficiency up to a thousand-fold.
125
Chapter 7: What We Crave: Carbohydrates

Glycoproteins
Most of the proteins occurring in blood serum are glycoproteins, which are
proteins with carbohydrates attached. The presence of the carbohydrate
tends to increase the hydrophilic nature of the protein. In general, the linkage
is by attachment to an asparagine, serine, or threonine residue. Some soluble
proteins and some membrane proteins are glycoproteins. We will see glyco-
proteins again at various times in later chapters.

Lipids and Membranes
In This Chapter
 Living with lipids
 Examining triglycerides
 Finding out about membranes
 Seeing how steroids and other lipids operate
A
long with cholesterol, lipids tend to have a bad reputation in today’s
world, even though they are absolutely necessary to good health. The
lipids are an exceedingly diverse group of biologically important materials
that are distinguished by solubility. A lipid is a member of a group of com-
pounds that are not soluble (or only sparingly soluble) in water but that are
soluble in nonpolar solvents or solvents of low polarity. The nonpolar nature
of lipids is due to the fact that a large portion of the molecule contains only
carbon and hydrogen. If there were significant amounts of oxygen or nitrogen
in the structure, the substance would be more polar and hence more soluble
in water. 
Lovely Lipids: An Overview
Lipids have many important biological roles, including being highly concen-
trated energy sources, membrane components, and molecular signals. There
are lots of kinds of lipids. Figure 8-1 provides a diagram showing the relation-
ship between many of the different categories of lipids. Arachidonic acid, a
fatty acid, appears in Figure 8-1 twice — once as the precursor (compound
leading) to leukotrienes and prostaglandins and again as a member of the
fatty acid group. We double-listed arachidonic acid this way because of its
very different roles in these two chemical pathways.

In the body, lipids provide energy storage and structure (cell membranes)
and regulate bodily functions. Many of the lipids work like soap and deter-
gents. Like soaps, lipids have a nonpolar region — usually a fatty acid — and
a polar region. Figure 8-2 shows a representation of the structure of a soap.
In water, soap forms a micelle, (see Figure 2-3 in Chapter 2) in which the non-
polar portions of the different molecules coalesce and leave the polar por-
tions on the outside next to the water. If there is any other nonpolar material
present, such as grease from dirty dishes, it tends to migrate to the interior
of the micelle. With the polar portions of the soap molecules on the outside,
the micelle appears as one large polar molecule instead of a number of
smaller molecules that have polar and nonpolar regions. 
The dual solubility nature of soap is why it removes grease or oil from your
skin or clothes. The grease or oil is nonpolar and, therefore, is not soluble in
water. The soap forms a micelle that surrounds the grease/oil in the nonpolar
portion of the micelle. The polar end of the soap micelle is soluble in water,

allowing the grease and oil to be removed during rinsing. Although many dif-
ferent types of lipids exist, our discussion in this chapter focuses on the 
following four types of lipids: 
 Fatty acids and derivatives (esters): Fats, oils, and waxes
 Complex lipids: Phosphoglycerides and sphingolipids
 Steroids
 Arachidonic acid devivatives: Prostaglandins, thromboxanes, and
eukotrienes
Lipids are important not only as individual molecules but also in terms of
their interactions with other lipids and non-lipids in the formation of lipid
bilayers or cell membranes. These interactions occur both at the cell bound-
ary and around some interior structures. The fatty acids portions of the lipids
are especially important in their physical and chemical properties. The natu-
rally occurring fatty acids have a few key features:
 They are all straight-chained with generally 10–20 (but sometimes more)
carbon atoms.
 They have an even number of carbon atoms. 
 If carbon-carbon double bonds are present, only the cis-isomer is present.
Table 8-1 lists a few of the common fatty acids.

Chapter 8: Lipids and Membranes

A wax is a simple ester of a fatty acid and a long-chain alcohol. The fatty acid
typically contains at least 10 carbon atoms, whereas the alcohol portion is
typically 16–30 carbon atoms. In general, a wax, such as the wax in your ears,
serves as a protective coating. Because they tend to be somewhat unreactive,
we do not discuss waxes in much detail in this book.
A Fatty Subject: Triglycerides
Fats (and oils) are triglycerides or triacylglycerols. That is, they are triesters of
fatty acids with glycerol. Glycerol is a trihydroxy alcohol (see Figure 8-3). In a
fat, each of the three alcohol groups becomes part of an ester through the
reaction with a fatty acid. The fatty acids may or may not be the same.
Properties and structures of fats
The basic difference between a fat and an oil is that a fat is a solid at room
temperature and an oil is a liquid. That said, two important structural factors
distinguish a fat from an oil. One is the size of the fatty acids, and the other is
the presence or absence of double bonds. The longer the fatty acid chain, the
higher the melting point. The greater the number of carbon-carbon double
bonds, the lower the melting point. 
A saturated fat consists of fatty acids with no carbon-carbon double bonds. An
unsaturated fat has a double bond while a polyunsaturated fat has multiple
double bonds.
There are more than 70 known naturally occurring fatty acids. In most natural
fats, there is a cis geometry about the double bonds. The presence of double
bonds puts “kinks” in the carbon chain, which prevent the fatty acid chains
from stacking together as roughly parallel chains. The inability of unsatu-
rated fatty acid chains to stack together inhibits the fat’s ability to solidify.
The treatment of an unsaturated fat or oil with hydrogen in the presence of a
catalyst such as nickel will lead to hydrogenation of some or all of the carbon-
carbon double bonds, forming carbon-to-carbon single bonds. This proce-
dure changes an unsaturated fat into a saturated fat. In most cases, only

partial hydrogenation takes place, and the hydrogenation raises the melting
point of the compound. By this procedure, it is possible to convert an oil
(liquid) into a fat (solid). Incomplete hydrogenation may change some of 
the cis arrangements into trans arrangements, producing a transfat.
Figure 8-4 shows the structure of a typical fat. Note that that the two upper
fatty acid chains (saturated) “stack” next to each other, but the lower chain
(unsaturated) does not.
Cleaning up: Breaking down a triglyceride
For centuries, the treatment of a fat (commonly animal fat) with a strong base
catalyst (generally lye — sodium hydroxide) has been used to produce soap.
John’s grandmother made soap by boiling hog fat with wood ashes — which
contain potassium and sodium hydroxides. She then skimmed off the soap
and pressed it into cakes. Unfortunately, Granny wasn’t very good at getting
all the proportions just right and tended to use too much base, making the
soap very alkaline. In this kind of reaction, called a saponification reaction,
hydrolysis of the ester groups in the presence of a base yields glycerol and
the carboxylate ions of the three fatty acids. A soap is really a sodium or
potassium salt of a fatty acid. The calcium and magnesium analogues, on the
other hand, are insoluble. If the soap is used with hard water (containing cal-
cium or magnesium ions), it precipitates as a greasy scum: bathtub ring. 
Acids also catalyze the hydrolysis of a fat to produce glycerol and a fatty acid.
Acid hydrolysis is reversible, whereas the presence of excess base inhibits the
reverse of saponification. During digestion, lipases break down triglycerides,
and bile salts make the fatty acid portions soluble. A lipase is an enzyme that
catalyses the decomposition of a fat. Bile salts are oxidation products of cho-
lesterol that act as detergents to make the products of the breakdown soluble.
In humans, absorption of the products occurs in the small intestine.

Chapter 8: Lipids and Membranes

No Simpletons Here: Complex Lipids
So far, we have been discussing simple lipids. However, some lipids are some-
what more complex. In general, complex lipids are esters of glycerol or some
other alcohol. The two major categories of complex lipids are the phospho-
glycerides and the sphingolipids. The phosphoglycerides are the plasmalogens
and the phosphatidates. The sphingolipids are the glycosphingolipids and the
sphingophospholipids. (Further subdivision is shown back in Figure 8-1.) 
A phospholipid is either a phosphoglyceride or a sphingophospholipid.
Phospholipids are major components of membranes. Any carbohydrate-
containing lipid is a glycolipid. The classifications of lipids overlap. (As you
may have noticed, nothing in biochemistry is ever truly simple.) For this
reason, a lipid may fall into more than one subcategory.
Phosphoglycerides 
The alcohol here is glycerol, to which two fatty acids and a phosphoric acid
are attached as esters. This basic structure is a phosphatidate. Phosphatidate
is an important intermediate in the synthesis of many phosphoglycerides.
The presence of an additional group attached to the phosphate allows for
many different phosphoglycerides. 
By convention, structures of these compounds show the three glycerol carbon
atoms vertically with the phosphate attached to carbon atom number three
(at the bottom). The occurrence of phosphoglycerides is almost exclusive to
plant and animal cell membranes. Plasmalogens and phosphatidates are
examples. These are also known as glycerophospholipids. 
Plasmalogens
Plasmalogens are a type of phosphoglyceride. The first carbon of glycerol has
a hydrocarbon chain attached via an ether, not ester, linkage. Ether linkages
are more resistant to chemical attack than ester linkages are. The second
(central) carbon atom has a fatty acid linked by an ester. The third carbon
links to an ethanolamine or choline by means of a phosphate ester. These
compounds are key components of the membranes of muscles and nerves.
Phosphatidates
Phosphatidates are lipids in which the first two carbon atoms of the glycerol
are fatty acid esters, and the third is a phosphate ester. The phosphate serves
as a link to another alcohol — usually ethanolamine, choline, serine, or a car-
bohydrate. The identity of the alcohol determines the subcategory of the
phosphatidate. There is a negative charge on the phosphate and, in the case
of choline or serine, a positive quaternary ammonium ion. (Serine also has a
negative carboxylate group.) The presence of charges gives a “head” with an
132
Part III: Carbohydrates, Lipids, Nucleic Acids, and More 

overall charge. The phosphate ester portion (“head”) is hydrophilic, whereas
the remainder of the molecule, the fatty acid “tail”, is hydrophobic. These are
important components for the formation of lipid bilayers.
Phosphatidylethanolamines, phosphatidylcholines, and other phospholipids
are examples of phosphatidates. Figure 8-5 illustrates examples of a phos-
phatidylethanolamine and a phosphatidylcholine.
The structures of some of the alcohols present in lipids appear in Figure 8-6.
Phosphatidylethanolamines
These are the most common phosphoglycerides in animals and plants. In ani-
mals, many of these are the cephalins, which are present in nerves and brain
tissue. They are also factors involved in blood clotting. Recall that the phos-
phate has a negative charge and that the nitrogen of the enthanolamine is a
quaternary ammonium ion with a positive charge.

Chapter 8: Lipids and Membranes

Phosphatidylcholines
These are the lecithins. Choline is the alcohol, with a positively charged 
quaternary ammonium, bound to the phosphate, with a negative charge.
Lecithins are present in all living organisms. An egg yolk has a high concen-
tration of lecithins — which are commercially important as an emulsifying
agent in products such as mayonnaise. Lecithins are also present in brain
and nerve tissue.
Other phospholipids
There are many other phospholipids, some of which are glycolipids. The gly-
colipids include phosphatidyl sugars where the alcohol functional group is
part of a carbohydrate. Phosphatidyl sugars are present in plants and certain
microorganisms. A carbohydrate is very hydrophilic due to the large number
of hydroxyl groups present. 
Sphingolipids
Sphingolipids occur in plants and animals, and are especially abundant in brain
and nerve tissue. In these lipids, sphingosine (Figure 8-7) replaces glycerol.
The alcohol groups in the sphingosine may form esters just like the similar
groups on glycerol. The amino group can form an amide. The combination of
a fatty acid and sphingosine, via an amide linkage, is a ceramide, which is an
intermediate in the formation of other sphingolipids.
Glycosphingolipids
A glycosphingolipid is an important membrane lipid containing a carbohydrate
attached to a ceramide. The carbohydrate serves as a polar (hydrophilic)
head. The carbohydrate may be either a monosaccharide or an oligosaccha-
ride. The carbohydrate sequence in the oligosaccharide is important in helping
these compounds recognize other compounds in biochemical reactions
sequences. The carbohydrate portion is always on the outside of the 
membrane.
Cerebrosides
A cerebroside consists of a monosaccharide attached to a ceramide. The car-
bohydrate is either glucose or galactose. Cerebrosides are present in nerve
and brain cells, though most animal cells contain some of these compounds.

Gangliosides
Gangliosides are sphingolipids with complex structures. The ceramide has an
oligosaccharide, containing three to eight monosaccharide units, attached.
The monosaccharide units may or may not be substituted. They are very
common as part of the outer membranes of nerve cells, where the sugar
sequence leads to cell recognition and communication. Small quantities of
gangliosides are part of the outer membranes of other cells. When present 
in a membrane, the carbohydrate portion is always extracellular.
Sphingophospholipids
Sphingophospholipids contain sphingosine, a fatty acid, phosphate, and
choline. An example is sphingomyelin, which is an important constituent of
the myelin sheath surrounding the axon of all nerve cells. Multiple sclerosis,
among other diseases, is a consequence of a fault with the myelin sheath.
Sphingomyelin is the most common of the sphingolipids, and it is the only
sphingosine phospholipid found in membranes.
Membranes: The Bipolar and the Bilayer
One use of lipids is in the construction of membranes. Membranes are used to
separate regions both in and around cells — a typical membrane, as shown in
Figure 8-8, is a lipid bilayer or bimolecular sheet. The polar portions of the
lipids, the heads, are on the outside edges of the bilayer, whereas the nonpo-
lar portions, the tails, are in the interior. The heads of the lipids appear as cir-
cles in our illustrations, and the tails appear as strings. The tails are usually
long fatty acid chains. The hydrophilic heads, often with a charge, are in 
contact with aqueous material, and the hydrophobic tails are away from the
aqueous material. Interactions between the hydrophobic tails are the key 
factors leading to the formation of lipid bilayers. Lipid bilayers tend to form
closed structures or compartments to avoid having exposed hydrophobic
edges. The membranes tend to be self-sealing.

Chapter 8: Lipids and Membranes

Actual cell membranes are not as symmetrical as the one shown in Figure 8-8.
This asymmetry is due in part to the presence of other components, and in
part to differences between the intracellular and extracellular surfaces. If the
fatty acid portions are not saturated, the tails will not form parallel structures,
and there will be “holes” present within the bilayer. These holes are an essen-
tial feature leading to membrane fluidity. Other components include proteins
and cholesterol. The carbohydrate portion of glycolipids is on the extracellu-
lar side of the bilayer instead of the intracellular side.
Polar materials cannot readily pass through the hydrophobic region of mem-
branes, and nonpolar materials cannot readily pass through the hydrophilic
outer region. Water, due to its small size and high concentration, can trans-
verse the bilayer faster than ions and most other polar molecules. In actual
cells, certain mechanisms allow material to cross the bilayer but require
other components to be present in the bilayer. These components, mostly
proteins, give selective permeability of the membranes. In addition, other
materials, such as cholesterol, are necessary to serve other functions, such
as stiffening the membrane.
Membranes may contain roughly from 20 to 80 percent protein, which may be
peripheral (on the surface of the membrane) or integral (extending into or
through the membrane). Integral proteins interact extensively with the
hydrophobic portion of the bilayer, as illustrated in Figures 8-9 and 8-10.

Part III: Carbohydrates, Lipids, Nucleic Acids, and More 

Peripheral proteins typically bind to the surface through electrostatic or
hydrogen bonding, although covalent interactions are possible. Proteins are
important for most membrane processes. If the protein is a glycoprotein, the
carbohydrate portion lies on the external side of the membrane and is impor-
tant to intercellular recognition.
Crossing the wall: Membrane transport
A lipid bilayer is, by its nature, impermeable to polar molecules and ions
(hydrophilic species). Nevertheless, cells need to be able to bypass this fea-
ture and get hydrophilic materials in and out. There are two ways to circum-
vent impermeability: A pump involves active transport using energy to work
against a concentration gradient, and a channel involves passive transport or
facilitated diffusion using a concentration gradient.
Nonpolar molecules are lipophilic and dissolve in the lipid bilayer. In general,
lipophilic materials pass through the membrane by simple diffusion along a
concentration gradient. Channels and pumps are mainly to allow hydrophilic
species to transverse the hydrophobic region of the bilayer.
Pumps
Pumps require energy to function. In many cases, the hydrolysis of ATP pro-
vides the needed energy. The generic name for this type of pump is a P-type
ATPase. The name derives from the transfer of a phosphate from an ATP to 
an intermediate, a step that is essential to the action of the pump. Pumps can
transfer other species than ions. 
137
Chapter 8: Lipids and Membranes
When is a solid a liquid? The fluid mosaic model
The lipid bilayer structure gives much insight into
the structure of membranes but little information
about their function. Many functions of the mem-
brane depend upon its fluidity, best described by
using the fluid mosaic model. In this model, the
membrane serves as a permeability barrier and
as a solvent for the integral proteins. Diffusion
along the plane of the membrane — lateral dif-
fusion — of the membrane components is often
rapid. In general, lipids move more rapidly than
proteins, with some proteins being essentially
immobile. Diffusion of membrane components
across the membrane — transverse diffusion —
is usually slow.
The fluidity of the membrane depends on a
number of factors. Bacteria adjust the fluidity by
utilizing fatty acid chains — longer chains are
less fluid than are shorter chains. The presence
of double bonds makes the membrane more
fluid. In animals, cholesterol controls the fluidity:
The greater the cholesterol concentration, the
less fluid the membrane. The transition from the
rigid to the fluid state occurs at a temperature
known as the melting temperature, Tm. 

Most animal cells have a high potassium ion and a low sodium ion concentra-
tion relative to the extracellular environment. It requires energy to generate
and maintain this gradient. The transport system is the Na+-K+ pump, also
referred to as Na+-K+ ATPase. Hydrolysis of ATP provides the energy to trans-
port potassium ions into the cell and sodium ions out of the cell. Both the
sodium and potassium ions must be simultaneously bound to the pump. The
pump simultaneously transports three sodium ions out of the cell as it trans-
ports two potassium ions in. 
Not all pumps require the hydrolysis of ATP to supply energy. Some utilize
the transport on one species to facilitate the transport of another. The trans-
port of one species with the concentration gradient can pump another
against the concentration gradient. The responsible membrane proteins are
the cotransporters or secondary transporters. Cotransporters may be either
symporters or antiporters. In a symporter, both transported species move in
the same direction, whereas in an antiporter, the species move in opposite
directions. The sodium-calcium exchanger is an example of an antiporter,
which pumps three sodium ions into a cell for every two calcium ions pumped
out. Some animal cells use a symporter to pump glucose coupled with sodium
ions into the cells.
Channels
A channel provides a means of passively transporting a species across a
membrane. It is possible to transport a species through a channel more 
than 1,000 times as fast as a pump’s. A channel is technically a tube running
through the membrane, but its behavior is significantly more complicated.
Channels are highly selective. Some select on size — sodium is smaller than
potassium — whereas others differentiate between anions and cations. A
channel exists in an open state to allow transport and a closed state to
inhibit it. Some type of regulation is required to convert a channel between
an open and a closed state. When a chemical potential regulates the channel,
it is a voltage-regulated gate. The regulation may be due to specific chemi-
cals. Chemically controlled regulation is ligand-gated. After the appropriate
regulator is removed, the open channels will spontaneously close.
The best-known ligand-gated channel is the acetylcholine receptor. This channel
is important for the transmission of nerve impulses. When a nerve impulse
reaches the junction between one nerve and the next — the synapse — it 
triggers the release of acetylcholine, which transverses the small gap to the
next nerve and attaches to acetylcholine receptors. This attachment opens
the channel, leading to inward sodium ion diffusion and outward potassium
ion diffusion. The change in the ion concentrations transmits the nerve
impulse into the second nerve cell. 
138
Part III: Carbohydrates, Lipids, Nucleic Acids, and More 

The increase in the sodium ion concentration in the second nerve cell trig-
gers a mechanism to remove sodium ions from the nerve cell. Later another
gate brings potassium ions back into the cell.
Steroids: Pumping up
Steroids are another class of lipids. All steroids have the basic core shown in
Figure 8-11. A, B, C, and D are common labels for the rings. Different steroids
have additions to this basic structure; these may include side chains, other
functional groups, and unsaturation or aromaticity of the rings.
Cholesterol is the most abundant steroid. It is a membrane component and
serves as the source of other steroids and related materials. Cholesterol
comes from the diet, but if insufficient cholesterol is available there, it is syn-
thesized in the liver. The steroid hormones are regulators produced from
cholesterol.
Bile salts (mentioned earlier) are a group of materials produced by the oxida-
tion of cholesterol. Unlike cholesterol and the other lipids, bile salts are 
soluble in water. They are useful as “detergents” to aid in digestion.
The steroids you hear about in the news being used by athletes and body-
builders are anabolic steroids, which increase the body’s ability to prevent
muscle breakdown and to actually increase the ability to produce muscle.
They have structures similar to testosterone, whose function is to enhance
male characteristics such as facial hair and muscle mass. However, steroids
in large doses have serious side effects: impotence, reduced testicle size,
liver tumors, enlargement of the heart, enlargement of the breasts in men,
aggressive behavior, and so on. (Sounds great, doesn’t it?) Their use without
a valid prescription has been illegal since 1991.

Prostaglandins, Thromboxanes, 
and Leukotrienes: Mopping Up
Arachidonic acid, a 20-carbon, polyunsaturated fatty acid, serves as the direct
or indirect starting material for the formation of prostaglandins, thromboxanes,
and leukotrienes. Cells synthesize both leukotrienes and prostaglandins from
arachidonic acid. Additional prostaglandins and thromboxanes come from the
prostaglandin derived from arachidonic acid. All three classes of compounds
are local hormones. Unlike other hormones, they are not transported via the
bloodstream. They are short-lived molecules that alter the activity of the cell
producing them and neighboring cells.
All of these compounds are extremely potent chemicals that serve as hormone
mediators. They also have many other medical applications and can cause
medical problems. They are also known as eicosanoids — from the Greek for
twenty, which alludes to the presence of 20 carbon atoms (Figure 8-12).
The name prostaglandin came from the belief that the prostate gland was its
source because they were first isolated from seminal fluid in 1935. Now we
know that they are produced in a very wide variety of cells. Prostaglandins
differ slightly from each other, but they all contain a five-carbon ring. These
minor difference lead to distinct behaviors, although all prostaglandins lower
blood pressure, induce contractions in smooth muscles, and are part of the
inflammatory response system.
A number of medications are synthetic prostaglandins. For example, deriva-
tives of the prostaglandin PGE2 are useful in inducing labor. Prostaglandins
associated with inflammation are the main cause of the associated redness,
pain, and swelling. The half-life of many prostaglandins is only a few minutes
or less. Platelets in the blood generate thromboxanes to serve as vasocon-
strictors and to induce aggregation of the platelets, two steps leading to the
formation of a blood clot. Thromboxane A2 is an example of one of these
agents that induces blood clotting. White blood cells, leukocytes, and other
tissues produce leukotrienes, whose name refers to where they were first dis-
covered (leukocytes) and to the presence of three conjugated double bonds
(triene). Leukotrienes are associated with allergy attacks.
Aspirin interferes with the synthesis of prostaglandins and thromboxanes.
Aspirin is an anti-inflammatory agent because it counters the inflammation
induced by prostaglandins. The interference with the formation of thrombox-
anes may be part of the reason why low doses of aspirin help prevent heart
attacks and strokes. Low thromboxane levels would inhibit blood clotting.
Another anti-inflammatory drug, cortisone, inhibits the release of arachi-
donic acid from cell membranes, which, in turn, inhibits the formation of 
the eicosanoids. The fatty acids in fish oils inhibit the formation of the more
potent leukotrienes and thromboxanes.

ucleic acids get their name because they were first found in the nuclei
of cells. DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) — the most famous nucleic acid —
is part of the chromosomes, which contain the genes. And the genes are ulti-
mately responsible for the synthesis of proteins. Most, if not all, of these pro-
teins are enzymes, each catalyzing a specific chemical reaction occurring in
the organism. Indeed, there is a one-gene-one-enzyme hypothesis, where each
gene is responsible for the synthesis of one enzyme.
DNA has two direct purposes: It must generate new DNA (replication) so that
new generations of cells will have the information necessary to their survival.
And it must generate RNA (ribonucleic acid). The RNA is involved in the direct
synthesis of proteins, called translation. These proteins are essential for the
maintenance of life.
Nucleotides: The Guts of DNA and RNA
Both DNA and RNA are polymers of nucleotides. A nucleotide is a combina-
tion of a nitrogen base, a 5-carbon sugar, and a phosphoric acid. There are
five different bases present in a nucleotide, and two different sugars. We take
a closer look at the components of these nucleotides and then show you how
they all fit together.
Reservoir of genetic info: Nitrogen bases
The bases fall into two categories, the general defining structures of which
appear in Figure 9-1.

 The purines (adenine and guanine), composed of two fused rings incor-
porating two nitrogen atoms in each ring and
 The pyramidines (cytosine, thymine, and uracil), composed of a single
ring with two nitrogen atoms in the ring structure
Adenine (A), guanine (G), and cytosine (C) occur in both DNA and RNA.
Thymine (T) is only found in DNA, whereas uracil (U) only occurs in RNA.
There are modified forms of some of these bases present in some nucleic
acid molecules. The circled hydrogen atoms shown in Figure 9-1 are lost
when combining with other components to produce a nucleic acid. The com-
plete structures of the five bases are shown in Figure 9-2. It is the sequence of
these bases that stores the genetic information.
The nitrogen and oxygen atoms present on the nitrogen bases provide a
number of sites where hydrogen bonding is possible. Hydrogen bonding is
most effective and easily formed between certain combinations of nitrogen
bases. Because of this, certain combinations will form, and it is this pattern
that is responsible for the transmission of information. The atoms on the
nitrogen bases normally use a regular numbering system, whereas the atoms
in the sugar component use primed numbers.

Chapter 9: Nucleic Acids and the Code of Life

The sweet side of life: The sugars
The 5-carbon sugars found in the nucleic acids are D-ribose and D-deoxyribose.
The difference between these two sugars is that deoxyribose is missing an
oxygen atom on carbon atom number 2’. The structures for these two sugars
appear in Figure 9-3. The arrows in the figure point to the alcohol group on
carbon atom number 1’, the anomeric carbon. This is where the nitrogen base
will attach. Both sugars adopt the β form of the furanose ring. Numbering of
the sugar begins with the anomeric carbon (1') and proceeds clockwise with
the –CH2OH carbon being 5'.
The sour side of life: Phosphoric acid
The third component of a nucleotide is a phosphoric acid (Figure 9-4). At
physiological pH it does not exist in the fully protonated form shown in the
figure. It is responsible for the “acid” in nucleic acid.

Tracing the Process: From Nucleoside 
to Nucleotide to Nucleic Acid
Remember Legos and Tinker Toys? Putting together the pieces to get some-
thing new? That’s what goes on in the construction of nucleic acids. Nature
first joins a nitrogen base and a 5-carbon sugar to form a nucleoside; then
that nucleoside joins with phosphoric acid to form a nucleotide; finally, the
combination of these nucleotides produces a nucleic acid.
First reaction: Nitrogen base + 
5-carbon sugar = nucleoside
The combination of a nitrogen base with a 5-carbon sugar is a nucleoside. The
general reaction appears in Figure 9-5. It is a condensation reaction. Remember
the condensation reactions you studied in ester formation in organic chem-
istry? This is exactly the same type. Here a compound containing hydrogen
(the nitrogen base) approaches another molecule containing an –OH group 
(a sugar). The hydrogen combines with the –OH to form water, which is
expelled. A bond forms in the remaining fragments.

Chapter 9: Nucleic Acids and the Code of Life

The name of the nucleoside comes from the nitrogen base if the sugar is
ribose; it has a prefix if the sugar is deoxyribose. For example, adenine com-
bines with ribose to form adenosine and combines with deoxyribose to form
deoxyadenosine. The structure for the nucleoside adenosine is in Figure 9-6.
The hydrogen atom lost from the base was the one circled in Figure 9-1.
Second reaction: Phosphoric acid + 
nucleoside = nucleotide
The combination of a phosphoric acid with a nucleoside produces a
nucleotide, which is a phosphate ester, as seen in Chapter 3, of a nucleoside.
The formation involves a condensation reaction between the phosphoric 
acid and the alcohol group on carbon number 5, the –CH2OH (Figure 9-7).
Adenosine monophosphate (AMP) is an example of a nucleotide (Figure 9-8).
Nucleotides are the monomers from which nucleic acids form. AMP is not
only one of the “Legos” that makes RNA but is also very much involved in 
the energy transfer process in the cells (much more on AMP in Part IV).

If the sugar is ribose, then the result is one of four ribonucleotides. If the
sugar is deoxyribose, the result is one of the four deoxyribonucleotides.
Third reaction: Nucleotide 
becomes nucleic acid
Nucleic acids form by joining nucleotides using the same condensation reac-
tions we’ve mentioned. This condensation reaction involves the phosphate 
of one nucleotide reacting with the alcohol group on carbon atom number 
3' of another nucleotide. Figure 9-9 illustrates. Note that the lower –OH, in the
circle, is from the phosphoric acid, attached to carbon-5'. The upper –H in
the circle is from the alcohol on carbon-3'.
The starting end of the polymer is 5', whereas the terminal end is 3'. Figure
9-10 illustrates the 5' and 3' carbon atoms on adenosine monophosphate.
A Primer on Nucleic Acids
Nucleic acids are responsible for storing and directing the information our
cells use for reproduction and growth. They are large molecules found in the
cell’s nucleus. The genetic information is contained in the DNA, in terms of its
primary and secondary structure. As a cell divides and reproduces, the
genetic information in the cell is replicated to the new cells, which must be
done accurately and precisely — no mistakes must be made. RNA’s role is to

DNA and RNA in the grand scheme of life
Both DNA and RNA are polymers composed of nucleotide subunits. However,
DNA is a much larger molecule than RNA. DNA molecules typically have mole-
cular weights in the billions. The human genome contains about 3 billion
nucleotides.
As a simplification, the structure of a particular nucleic acid may be repre-
sented as 5'-C-G-T-A-3'. This abbreviation indicates that we begin at the 5' end
and end at the 3' end (as always), and the nitrogen bases on the nucleotides
are, in order, cytosine (C), guanine (G), thymine (T) and adenine (A). There are
three different types of RNA, and each one has a specific use:
 Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is the most common: 75–80 percent occurs within
the ribosomes of the cell.
 Transfer RNA (tRNA) accounts for 10–15 percent.
 Messenger RNA (mRNA) makes up the remainder.
All three types are important to protein synthesis — which occurs in the
ribosomes, home of ribosomal RNA (rRNA). The amino acids necessary for
protein synthesis are transferred to the ribosomes by transfer RNA (tRNA).
The message instructing the ribosomes how to assemble the protein travels
from the DNA to the ribosome via messenger RNA (mRNA). This message
tells the ribosome the sequence of amino acids to make a specific protein.
Transfer RNA contains the fewest nucleotides: 70–90. The average mRNA has
about 1,200 nucleotides. There are three subcategories of rRNA ranging from
about 120 to over 3,700 nucleotides. (DNA typically has between 1 million and
100 million nucleotides, though viral DNA tends to be smaller.) Ribonucleotides
have other uses in addition to building RNA. They are present in energy mole-
cules (ATP), in intracellular hormone mediator (cyclic AMP), and in certain
coenzymes (FAD and NAD+). Plants and animals contain both DNA and RNA.
Viruses can contain either DNA or RNA.
Nucleic acid structure
The structure of a particular nucleic acid controls its function within the
organism. For example, the structure of a particular tRNA determines which
specific amino acid it will transfer to the ribosome for protein synthesis. In
fact, the difference between DNA and RNA resides in the structure of the mol-
ecules. Because of the complexity of these types of molecules, there may be
more than one key type of structure present.
151
Chapter 9: Nucleic Acids and the Code of Life

The primary structure of the nucleic acids is the sequence of nucleotides, the
order in which the individual nucleotides have been joined. This sequencing
determines which hydrogen bonds form, and this, in turn, controls much of
the function of the nucleic acid. DNA also has an important secondary struc-
ture, a consequence of hydrogen bonding between the nitrogen bases on the
DNA strands. The result is that DNA consists of a double helix — which looks
like a ladder twisted lengthwise — where hydrogen bonds (the rungs in the
ladder) hold the two primary structures together. 
The hydrogen bonds between the two stands of DNA make the two strands
complementary (paired). Every A is complementary to a T, and every G is
complementary to a C in base pairing. Base pairing is essential for the func-
tion of the nucleic acids.
The two DNA strands are antiparallel, which means that the 5' end of one
strand connects to the 3' end of its complementary strand. This pairing also
places the more polar (more hydrophilic) sugar and phosphate groups on the
outside and the less polar (more hydrophobic) nitrogen bases on the inside.
(Note that hydrophilic and hydrophobic as used here are relative terms.) The
antiparallel nature affects how DNA produces new DNA (the replication
process) and new RNA (the transcription process).
Although each of the nitrogen bases is very efficient at forming hydrogen
bonds, certain combinations are extremely effective. In DNA, an adenine is
capable of forming two hydrogen bonds to thymine (Figure 9-11), and guanine
can form three hydrogen bonds to cytosine (Figure 9-12). 
Adenine is also able to form hydrogen bonds with uracil when DNA interacts
with RNA or when two RNA molecules interact. The interaction between 
adenine and uracil is shown in Figure 9-13.

The ability to form these specific combinations is important in real life — 
this is the genetic code we all have heard so much about. The sequencing of
nucleotides in the nucleic acids and the sequencing of amino acids in the pro-
teins all depend on these hydrogen bonds. Without them, the appropriate
information would not be transferred precisely, and you might produce 
kittens instead of kids. The result? DNA, the structure of life (Figure 9-14).

A
n organism must absorb a variety of materials to live, many of which fall
into the category of food, certainly one of our favorite categories, espe-
cially John’s. These foodstuffs required by an organism for life and growth are
classified as nutrients. Nutrients are the substances in the diet necessary for
growth, replacement, and energy. Here are the six general classes of nutrients:
 Carbohydrates
 Lipids
 Proteins
 Vitamins
 Minerals
 Water
Digestion converts large molecules in food into smaller molecules that can be
absorbed. During digestion, carbohydrates (with the exception of the mono-
saccharides), lipids, and proteins are broken down into their components.
These components are often used by the organism directly for growth and
replacement. For animals, energy comes primarily from carbohydrates 
and lipids, but proteins can also serve as an energy source. 
Vitamins are other organic materials required by an organism, and minerals
are inorganic materials required by an organism. In addition, all living organ-
isms require water to survive. Water is a wonderful substance. For more
about the unusual properties of water, check out Chapter 2 in this book or
Chemistry For Dummies by John T. Moore (Wiley).

More than One-a-Day: 
Basics of Vitamins
Vitamins are organic compounds that are required, in small quantities, for
normal metabolism. The term active form is used to describe the structural
form of the molecule, in this case vitamins, that performs its function
(exhibits activity) within the organism. In general, humans cannot synthesize
sufficient quantities of vitamins; thus, vitamins must come from other
sources — through the diet and/or in pill form. A deficiency of a vitamin in
the diet leads to a health problem. The general symptoms for any vitamin
deficiency include frequent illness, slow healing of wounds, and tiredness. 
It was not until the early 1900s that the need for trace nutrients such as vita-
mins and minerals was first established.
There are two categories of vitamins: water-soluble and fat-soluble. Water-
soluble vitamins include vitamin C and the B vitamins. Vitamins A, D, E, and K
comprise the other category, the fat-soluble vitamins. Water-soluble vitamins
tend to have more oxygen and nitrogen in their structure than fat-soluble vit-
amins, which have significant hydrocarbon portions in their structure. The
majority of water-soluble vitamins either act as coenzymes or are important
in the synthesis of coenzymes. Fat-soluble vitamins serve a variety of bio-
chemical functions.
The body can easily eliminate an excess of the water-soluble vitamins, nor-
mally in the urine. The bright yellow of the urine of a person taking large
doses of vitamin C attests to that fact. Because the body does not store
water-soluble vitamins, continual replacement is necessary. The body can
store excess amounts of a fat-soluble vitamin in the body’s fatty tissue, and
therefore elimination is not very easy. Unfortunately, this can lead to an accu-
mulation of these vitamins, sometimes to toxic levels. One should consider
this before consuming mega quantities of the fat-soluble vitamins.  
To B or Not to B: B Complex Vitamins
The B vitamins — or B complex — comprise a number of water-soluble vita-
mins that are found together in a number of sources. Originally, this mixture
was thought to be only one vitamin (vitamin B). With the possible exception
of vitamin B6, these appear to be relatively nontoxic. In general, the B complex
is important for healthy skin and nervous systems.
156
Part III: Carbohydrates, Lipids, Nucleic Acids, and More 

Vitamin B1 (thiamine)
Thiamine is important to carbohydrate metabolism. Like the other B vita-
mins, the body does not store it. In addition, prolonged cooking of food can
destroy it. Once absorbed in the body, thiamine is converted to a form that is
biologically active through the attachment of a pyrophosphate (diphosphate)
group to give thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP). The structures of vitamin B1
and thiamine pyrophosphate are shown in Figure 10-1.
TPP is a coenzyme used in decarboxylating pyruvate to acetyl-CoA and 
α-ketoglutarate to succinyl-CoA. In addition, TPP is necessary for the synthe-
sis of ribose.
A deficiency in thiamine leads to beriberi, which causes deterioration in the
nervous system. Beriberi was prevalent in regions where rice was a major
food source. Rice, particularly polished rice, is low in thiamine. Using brown
rice, which has more thiamine, alleviates this problem. Nursing infants are
particularly at risk when their mothers have a thiamine deficiency. Many
alcoholics also suffer from this condition because many “foods” high in alco-
hol are particularly low in vitamins.

Good dietary sources of thiamine include liver, spinach, green peas, navy and
pinto beans, whole-grain cereals, and most legumes. 
Vitamin B2 (riboflavin)
Riboflavin is essential to the synthesis of flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and
flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD). The structures of these materials are
shown in Figure 10-2. FMN and FAD are important coenzymes involved in a
number of biochemical redox processes. The name riboflavin alludes to the
presence of ribitol, an alcohol derived from ribose. The other part of
riboflavin is the ring system isoalloazine, a flavin derivative.

No deficiency diseases are associated with riboflavin; however, a deficiency
does lead to burning and itchy eyes, dermatitis, and anemia. Dietary sources
of this vitamin include soybeans, liver, milk, cheese and green leafy vegeta-
bles. Riboflavin is stable during cooking, but is broken down by light.
Vitamin B3 (niacin)
The term niacin applies to two compounds: nicotinic acid and nicotinamide.
These two compounds along with nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)
appear in Figure 10-3. Nicotinamide is part of the coenzymes NAD+ and nicoti-
namide dinucleotide phosphate (NADP+). These coenzymes work with a
number of enzymes in catalyzing a number of redox processes in the body. 
Niacin is one of the few vitamins that the body can synthesize. The synthesis
utilizes tryptophan and is not very efficient.
Pellagra is a niacin-deficiency disease. Symptoms include loss of appetite,
dermatitis, mental disorders, diarrhea, and possibly death. It was common in
the southern United States in the early 1900s because many people had a diet
of corn, which is neither a good source of niacin or tryptophan.
There are many dietary sources for niacin, including most meats and vegeta-
bles, milk, cheese, and grains.
Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine)
This vitamin consists of three components: pyridoxine, pyridoxal, and pyri-
doxamine. All three need to be converted to pyridoxal phosphate, a form that
is biologically active in the organism. The structures for these compounds
appear in Figure 10-4. Pyridoxal phosphate serves as a coenzyme in a variety
of processes, including the interconversion of α-keto acids and amino acids.
Avocados, chicken, fish nuts, liver, and bananas are especially good food
sources of vitamin B6. Heating decreases its concentration in food.
There is no pyridoxine-deficiency disease known; however, low levels can
lead to irritability, depression, and confusion. Unlike the other water-soluble
vitamins, there is evidence that large doses of vitamin B6 may lead to health
problems. The symptoms of excess vitamin B6 consumption include irre-
versible nerve damage.

Biotin
Biotin is a coenzyme important to many carboxylation reactions. Biotin is the
carbon transporter in both lipid and carbohydrate metabolism.
Bacteria in the intestinal track synthesize biotin in sufficient quantities to
minimize the chances for a deficiency. However, antibiotics can inhibit the
growth of these bacteria and induce a deficiency. In these circumstances, 
the symptoms include nausea, dermatitis, depression, and anorexia. Biotin 
is stable to cooking. Its structure is shown in Figure 10-5.
Folic acid
Bacteria in the intestinal track also produce folic acid; however, green leafy
vegetables, dried beans, and liver are also sources. Reduction of folic acid
yields tetrahydrofolic acid, the active form. Both structures are shown in
Figure 10-6. The coenzyme transports a carbon, usually as a methyl or formyl,
in the synthesis of heme, nucleic acids, choline, and several other compounds.
Although cooking easily destroys the compound, intestinal bacteria normally
produce sufficient quantities.
Folic acid is critical to the prevention of malformations of the brain (anen-
cephaly) and spine (spina bifida). A deficiency of folic acid affects the synthe-
sis of purines — symptoms include gastrointestinal disturbances and anemia.
Pregnant women are normally advised to take a vitamin high in folic acid to
help in the normal development of the fetus, especially the spine and brain.
Sulfa drugs interfere with the formation of folic acid by some pathogens via 
a form of competitive inhibition.

Pantothenic acid
Pantothenic acid’s name derives from a Greek word meaning “from every-
where.” As you might expect, then, it has numerous sources, including whole
grains, eggs, and meat. Deficiency is virtually unknown. The vitamin is not
destroyed by moderate cooking temperatures, but it is not stable at high
cooking temperatures. Its structure appears in Figure 10-7.

Pantothenic acid is necessary in the biosynthesis of coenzyme A. Coenzyme
A is an exceedingly important substance in many biological processes
because this coenzyme transfers acyl groups.
The wonders of vitamin B12
Vitamin B12 is the only known natural organometallic compound. It does not
occur in higher plants, and apparently only bacteria are capable of synthesiz-
ing it — bacteria who live in their hosts in a symbiotic relationship.
Unfortunately, higher animals including human beings do not have these
types of bacteria. Thus, it is necessary to obtain vitamin B12 from food. The
name cyanocobalamine refers to the presence of cyanide. The cyanide is an
artifact of the isolation of the compound and is not naturally present. Vitamin
B12 is necessary to the formation of two coenzymes: methylcobalamin and 
5'-deoxyadenosylcobalamin. The structure of methylcobalamin is shown in
Figure 10-8.

Both coenzymes assist in reactions involving rearrangements.
Methylcobalamin is useful in methyl transfer reactions. The coenzyme 
5'-deoxyadenosylcobalamin works in some rearrangement reactions where 
a hydrogen atom and a group attached to an adjacent carbon exchange 
positions.
Pernicious anemia usually results from poor absorption of vitamin B12. Normal
stomach cells produce a glycoprotein that aids in the absorption of the vita-
min in the intestine. It is the lack of this intrinsic factor that leads to the vita-
min deficiency and not the lack of the vitamin in the diet. Elderly people may
have difficulty in generating sufficient quantities of the intrinsic factor, and
strict vegetarians also may develop symptoms. The symptoms of pernicious
anemia include lesions on the spinal cord leading to a loss of muscular coor-
dination and gastrointestinal problems. The blood contains large, fragile, and
immature red blood cells. Dietary sources include meat, eggs, milk and cere-
als. This vitamin is stable to cooking.
Vitamin A
Vitamin A is not a single compound — a number of compounds are biologi-
cally active, that is they undergo biological reactions within the organism.
The parent compound is 11-trans-retinol, found in milk and eggs. Vitamin A is
exclusive to animals, and the plant pigment β-carotene can serve as a precur-
sor (Figure 10-9). As a precursor, it is a provitamin. Cleavage of β-carotene
yields two vitamin A active species. Any β-carotene that doesn’t become 
vitamin A is used as an antioxidant.

Vitamin A is especially important to vision. Part of the vision process involves
the absorption of light. This absorption causes the geometry on the double
bond between carbon atoms 11 and 12 to change from cis to trans. The iso-
merization triggers a series of events, giving rise to a nerve impulse. An
enzyme reverses the isomerization so the molecule may be reused. In addi-
tion to being directly involved in vision, vitamin A also promotes the develop-
ment of the epithelial cells producing the mucous membranes, which protect
the eyes and many other organs from infections and irritants. Vitamin A also
helps in the changes in the bone structures that occur as an infant matures.
A deficiency in vitamin A begins with night blindness, followed by other eye
problems, which could lead to blindness. An extreme deficiency may lead to
xerophthalmia, inflammation of the eyelids and eyes, which can cause infec-
tions and blindness. Young animals require vitamin A for growth, and adults
are capable of storing several months’ supply of it, primarily in the liver. The
livers of some animals, such as polar bears and seals, may have such a high
vitamin A concentration that they are toxic to humans. Excessive dosages of
vitamin A may lead to acute toxicity, and as a fat-soluble vitamin, it is not
easily eliminated. Symptoms include nausea, vomiting, blurred vision, and
headaches. Large doses have been linked to birth defects and spontaneous
abortions. The provitamin, β-carotene, is not toxic. 
Vitamin D
Vitamin D is sometimes called the sunshine vitamin. It can be produced in the
body through the action of sunlight, which is ultraviolet radiation. Individuals
walking around outside nude or semi-nude normally have very little trouble
with vitamin D deficiency. The rest of us, however, depend on vitamin 
D-fortified foods, especially milk.
Several compounds exhibit vitamin D activity. Only two of them — actually
provitamins — occur commonly in food: ergosterol and 7-dehydrocholesterol.
Irradiation with ultraviolet light converts ergosterol into vitamin D2, ergocalif-
erol. Ultraviolet irradiation, particularly in the skin of animals, converts 7-
dehydrocholesterol into vitamin D3, cholecalciferol. (A little confusingly,
vitamin D1 is a mixture of vitamin D2 and vitamin D3.) The structures of ergos-
terol, vitamin D2, 7-dehydrocholesterol, and vitamin D3 appear in Figure 10-10. 
The body’s ability to absorb calcium and phosphorus is tied to vitamin D.
Teeth and bone have large amounts of these two elements and are the first
parts of the body affected by a vitamin D deficiency. Osteomalacia, a condi-
tion in which a softening of the bones may lead to deformities, may also
result. (In infants and children, osteomalacia is called rickets.) A vitamin D
166
Part III: Carbohydrates, Lipids, Nucleic Acids, and More 

deficiency is more serious in children than in adults because growth requires
larger quantities of calcium and phosphorus. Persons with some portion of
their skin routinely exposed to sunlight seldom develop a deficiency.

Symptoms of excessive amounts of vitamin D include nausea, diarrhea,

Vitamin E
The tocopherols are a group of compounds that exhibit vitamin E activity. The
most effective is α-tocopherol (see Figure 10-11). Vitamin E comes from a
number of sources, vegetable oils, nuts, whole grains, leafy vegetables, to
name a few. Deficiencies are rare except in individuals on a no-fat diet or 
who, for medical reasons, cannot efficiency absorb fat. Cystic fibrosis may
interfere with fat absorption.
Vitamin E serves as an effective anti-oxidant. Anti-oxidants are necessary to
minimize the damage caused by oxidants present in the body — many prob-
lems associated with aging are apparently due to oxidants. Vitamin E may
also help prevent cholesterol deposits in the arteries. There are no well-
documented problems with the use of large doses; however, some recent
studies, although disputed, warn against taking mega doses of vitamin E.
Vitamin K
Vitamin K1 (Figure 10-12) is one of many compounds that exhibit vitamin K
activity and differ in the side-chains attached to the ring system. One chain 
is usually a methyl; the other typically has at least 20 carbon atoms.

Vitamin K is necessary to produce the proenzyme prothrombin, which helps
blood clot. A vitamin K deficiency is uncommon because intestinal bacteria
normally produce sufficient quantities, although several foods are also good
sources, including green leafy vegetables, cauliflower, broccoli, organ meats
(love that liver!), milk, soybeans, avocados, and bananas. Two tablespoons of
parsley contains almost twice your recommended daily amount of vitamin K.
Prolonged use of antibiotics can decrease the number of these vitamin K-
producing bacteria and lead to a reduction in vitamin K in the body. One
symptom of a deficiency is an increase in the time necessary to form a blood
clot, and such individuals are prone to develop serious bruises from even
minor injuries. Infants with a deficiency have been known to die from brain
hemorrhage. Increasing the vitamin K intake of the mothers decreases the
likelihood of this occurrence.
Vitamin C
Vitamin C is another name for ascorbic acid (Figure 10-13). Dehydroascorbic
acid also has vitamin C activity. Vitamin C is water-soluble — thus the body
can readily eliminate excess, and large doses are not toxic.

A deficiency in vitamin C leads to the disease scurvy, symptoms of which
include a weakening of the collagen — an important protein in connective 
tissues such as ligaments and tendons. Many foods contain vitamin C, 
especially plants and citrus fruits, so it is easy to prevent scurvy. For years,
British ships carried limes as a source of vitamin C (leading, incidentally, to
the slang term limey to refer to a British sailor). Many mammals (other than
humans) synthesize vitamin C from glucose. Cooking, especially prolonged
cooking, destroys vitamin C. Vitamin C is an antioxidant. Like vitamin E, it
helps prevent damage produced by oxidants. It also helps in the absorption
of iron, and keeps the iron in the +2 state. Vitamin C helps convert some of
the proline in collagen C to hydroxyproline, which stabilizes the collagen.

Be Quiet: Hormones
In This Chapter
 Examining the structures of hormones
 Finding out about some important hormones
 Discovering how hormones function
W
e know with this chapter title you are expecting several jokes, but we’ll
try to restrain ourselves and play it straight.
Hormones are materials produced in one area of the body and used in a 
different area. They are molecular messengers that are created in certain
glands in the body and then travel through the bloodstream to the target
organ. Other substances, called paracrine factors or growth and differentiation
factors (GDFs), also convey biochemical information within a particular organ
(a bit like passing a note in class). This conveyance is accomplished by
simple diffusion over a small distance. Some biochemical substances may be
both a hormone and a paracrine factor.
The endocrine glands produce most — but not all — hormones. Endocrine
glands include the hypothalamus, pituitary, pancreas, adrenal, liver, testes,
and ovaries. Now surely that got your attention! Some glands produce a single
hormone, whereas others produce more than one. The simplified viewpoint
(and we are all about keeping it simple) is that the pituitary gland acts as the
central control for the endocrine system. Hormones from the pituitary gland
do cause other glands to produce hormones that affect other systems — 
however, there are glands that have the same effect on the pituitary gland.
Structures of Some Key Hormones
There are three groups of hormones:
 Proteins, such as insulin
 Steroids, materials derived from cholesterol
 Amines, such as epinephrine

These materials allow one part of the body to influence what occurs elsewhere.
These molecules are so efficient that only very low concentrations, typically
10-7 to 10-10 M, are necessary. That’s a really small amount! The low concentra-
tions make identification and isolation of these substances difficult.
Proteins
The protein, or polypeptide, hormones, typically produced by the pituitary
and hypothalamus glands, vary greatly in size — from simple tripeptides to
larger molecules with more than 200 amino acid residues. Protein hormones
are a diverse collection of molecules, including insulin (the structure of
which you can see in Chapter 5).
Others include the thyrotropin-releasing factor, which induces the release or
production of a biochemical (thyrotropin, in this case). The thyrotropin-
releasing factor hormone is a tripeptide containing glutamine (modified), 
histidine, and proline (modified). Another one is the growth-hormone-release-
inhibitory factor, which inhibits the release or production of a chemical
species. Together (Figure 11-1), these types of hormones provide a mecha-
nism to start and stop an action. The idea is to maintain a tight biochemical
control of biochemical processes, such as growth. 
Steroids
You have no doubt read about steroid use among athletes, where it is used to
increase muscle mass — to “pump-up,” in other words. Steroid hormones,
produced by the body’s ovaries, testes, and adrenal glands, are cholesterol
derivatives of about the same size as the parent molecule. They include the
estrogens (female sex hormones), the androgens (male sex hormones), and
the adrenal cortical hormones, such as aldosterone and cortisol. The estro-
gens and androgens are responsible for the development of the secondary
sex characteristics of both females and males, respectively. These character-
istics include enlargement of the breasts of females and development of facial
hair in males.
174
Part III: Carbohydrates, Lipids, Nucleic Acids, and More 

The adrenal cortical hormones (Figure 11-2), which include the glucocorti-
coids and the mineralocorticoids, have a variety of functions. The glucocorti-
coids, such as cortisol, are important to several metabolic pathways. The
mineralocorticoids, such as aldosterone, are important to the transport of
inorganic species, such as sodium or potassium ions.

Amines
The amine hormones, typically produced by the thyroid and adrenal glands,
are small molecules, many of which are derivatives of tyrosine. These hor-
mones include thyroxine and triiodthyronine, produced by the thyroid gland,
and epinephrine and norepinephrine produced by the adrenal gland. Figure 11-3
illustrates the structures of these hormones. Thyroxine and triiodothyronine
are important metabolic-rate regulators. In fact, thyroxine is one of the most
important substances in the body. It influences carbohydrate metabolism as
well as protein synthesis and is involved in cardiovascular, brain, and renal
function. Epinephrine and norepinephrine are important to control heart
rate, blood flow, and metabolic rate.

Chapter 11: Be Quiet: Hormones

Before and After: Prohormones
The synthesis of some hormones, like some enzymes, does not begin by pro-
ducing the molecule in its active form. Instead, a prohormone forms, which
remains unreactive and dormant until activated — sort of like us in the morn-
ing until we get our first cups of coffee. This process allows the body to build
a store of a hormone for quick activation. Activating the prohormone requires
less time than would the total synthesis of the molecule.
Proinsulin
Proinsulin is an example of a prohormone. Insulin is the hormone responsible
for controlling blood sugar levels. Too much insulin results in a low blood
sugar level (hypoglycemia), whereas too little insulin leads to elevated blood
sugar levels (hyperglycemia). Your body needs to have a supply of insulin
readily available for when you eat a piece of candy, such as a large chocolate-
hazelnut truffle. If all of this insulin were already in your bloodstream, upon
eating the candy you would become hypoglycemic. If the insulin were not
present at all, you might become hyperglycemic until your body was able 
to synthesize sufficient insulin from the individual amino acids. Both hypo-
glycemia and hyperglycemia can lead to serious medical problems. The pres-
ence of a quantity of inactive insulin, ready to jump into action at a moment’s
notice, is the solution.
Bovine insulin (insulin produced from cows) contains two polypeptide chains,
A and B, linked by disulfide linkages, with a total of 51 amino acid residues.
Bovine proinsulin has 30 more amino acid residues than insulin does.
Proinsulin is a single polypeptide chain with the insulin disulfide linkages. 
By removing a polypeptide sequence from the central region of this chain
(residues 31–60), insulin forms. The excised portion originally connected one
end of the A chain of insulin to the end of the B chain. The conversion of proin-
sulin to insulin requires the cleavage of two peptide bonds.
Angiotensinogen
Angiotensinogen is the prohormone of angiotensin II, a hormone that signals
the adrenal cortex to release aldosterone. (In addition, angiotensin II is the
most potent known vasoconstrictor.) The conversion of the prohormone to
the hormone requires two steps. The first step uses the enzyme rennin. This
peptidase, produced in the kidney, specifically cleaves a peptide bond between
two leucine residues, the result of which is the decapeptide angiotensin I.
178
Part III: Carbohydrates, Lipids, Nucleic Acids, and More 

The second step utilizes the peptidase known as the angiotensin-converting
enzyme. This enzyme, which occurs primarily in the lungs, cleaves the 
C-terminal dipeptide from angiotensin I to yield angiotensin II. These bio-
chemical reactions can occur very rapidly, ensuring that the hormone can 
be quickly activated when needed by the body.
Fight or Flight: Hormone Function
The endocrine system, which generates the hormones, consists of a number
of apparently unrelated organs: the liver, the ovaries or testes, the thyroid,
the pancreas, and a number of other glands — components that are part of a
complex, integrated network. A malfunction of one affects others. 
Opening the letter: Hormonal action
Several mechanisms lead to the regulation of hormones. A control loop is the
simplest. In many cases, one hormone stimulates the production of others so
that many actions may occur before some type of control occurs.
Simple control loops
We are all familiar with control loops. You study for a test, but get a so-so
grade. So you study harder for the next exam. Your grade provides feedback,
causing your study habits to (hopefully) change. In the body, a control loop
process begins with an external stimulus signaling a gland to generate a hor-
mone. This hormone then influences its target site. Action by the target leads
to a change, which signals the gland to stop. The action of the hormone caus-
ing the stop signal provides a negative feedback. An example of this type of
loop is the production of insulin by the pancreas. The presence of high glu-
cose levels in the bloodstream signals the pancreas to release insulin. The
released insulin lowers the glucose level in the bloodstream. The reduced
glucose level signals the pancreas to stop releasing insulin. The low glucose
level is the negative feedback. This is a simplification; other factors may trig-
ger the release of insulin. In addition, high glucose levels can trigger other
biochemical functions, such as the synthesis of glycogen in the liver.
Hypothalamus-pituitary control
The hypothalamus-pituitary system is a very complex example of the other
extreme of hormone control. The hypothalamus and the pituitary glands are
in such close proximity that they behave almost as a single unit. 
179
Chapter 11: Be Quiet: Hormones

Initially, the central nervous system signals the hypothalamus to release a
hormone called a hormone-releasing factor, which signals the pituitary. The
pituitary, thus signaled, releases another hormone into the bloodstream. This
hormone may target a specific organ or signal another part of the endocrine
system to secrete yet another hormone. The presence of this final hormone
serves as a negative feedback signal to the hypothalamus to stop secreting
the hormone-releasing factor to the pituitary. Again, this is a simplistic view
of a complicated system. An analogy might be your parents seeing your so-so
exam grade. They freak out and force you to study harder. You are being influ-
enced by an external force, in this case, your parents.
Figure 11-4 gives a more detailed representation of this system. Although the
pituitary gland is known as the “master gland,” this figure indicates that it is,
in fact, the hypothalamus that deserves this honor.

Models of hormonal action 
Two models have been proposed to account for the molecular action of hor-
mones. The first is the two-messenger hypothesis, which applies primarily to
polypeptide and amine hormones. The other, steroid hormonal action, applies
primarily to steroids. We use a simplistic approach (the KISS rule: Keep It
Simple, Silly) for each model to emphasize their basic concepts. The actual
processes involve many more changes.
The two-messenger model: Like the mail
Studies into the hormonal action of epinephrine (adrenaline) led to the devel-
opment of this model. Later work indicated that the model applies to other
hormonal systems as well. In the two-messenger model, a hormone binds to 
a receptor site on the exterior of a cell. This binding induces the release of
another agent within the cell. The hormone is the first messenger, and the
other agent in the second messenger.
For example, the adrenal medulla releases epinephrine, the “fight or flight”
hormone, in vertebrate animals. This release initiates a number of responses,
including glycogenolysis, the breakdown of glycogen. Glycogenolysis releases
glucose for use in rapid energy production. As with other hormones, the con-
centration of hormone required is very low. For epinephrine, it is about 10-9 M.
The released epinephrine acts as the first messenger (the extracellular one).
Molecules of epinephrine bind to specific receptor sites on the surface of the
target cells — primarily the skeletal muscles and, to a lesser extent, liver. The
binding of epinephrine to the outside of liver cells induces the enzyme adeny-
late cyclase, bound to the interior of the cell membrane, to synthesize cyclic
AMP (see Figure 11-5). Cyclic AMP, or cAMP, is the second messenger (the
intracellular one). The second messenger initiates a series of events terminat-
ing in the release of glucose (glycogenolysis).
Initially, the cAMP binds to the regulatory subunit of protein kinase, and this
activates the membrane-bound enzyme. The released protein kinase then
activates phosphorylase kinase. This process requires calcium ion and ATP.
(Muscular action releases calcium ion, which aids the process.) Phosphorylase
kinase, with aid of ATP and magnesium ion, converts inactive phosphorylase
b to active phosphorylase a. The increased presence of this enzyme acceler-
ates the breakdown of glycogen with the release of D-glucose-1-phosphate.
Phosphoglucomutase then converts D-glucose-1-phosphate to D-glucose-
6-phosphate. Finally, D-glucose-6-phosphatase catalyzes the loss of the phos-
phate to release glucose, which may be used in the cell or, more importantly,
may enter the bloodstream. Whew!
181
Chapter 11: Be Quiet: Hormones

The enzyme protein kinase also catalyzes the conversion of glycogen syn-
thase (active) to phosphor-glycogen synthase (inactive). Thus, while the
level of protein kinase is high, the production of new glycogen ceases. The
inhibition of glycogen synthesis also means that more glucose will be avail-
able for rapid actions, such as running away from an angry pit bull.
Steroid hormonal action
Unlike hormones in the two-messenger system, steroid hormones cross the
membrane and enter the cell. This mechanism applies to other hormones as
well, such as thyroid hormones, in addition to the steroid hormones.
The first system described by this model was the action of estradiol on uter-
ine tissue in mammals. The estradiol, an estrogen, enters the cell where it
binds to an estrogen-receptor protein. The binding does not involve covalent
bonding, but induces instead a conformational change in the protein. The
change in the shape of the protein allows it to pass through the “door” into
the cell nucleus. The hormone-protein complex then enters the cell nucleus
where it binds to a specific site on a chromosome. This binding to the chro-
mosome stimulates transcription to produce mRNA, which, in turn, exits the
nucleus and synthesizes protein molecules through translation.
Three basic factors differentiate the steroid system from the two-messenger
system. First, in the steroid system the hormone enters the cell. Second,
there is a specific receptor molecule within the cytosol, the fluid inside the
cell. Finally, the hormone action is at the chromosome level.

or anyone to do anything requires energy, and this is
where we focus on the way life obtains and uses it.
Here we take a gander at energy needs and follow the trail
of where that energy goes and why. The main character in
this part is your good buddy ATP, and running through this
episode is where you’ll find the citric acid cycle. Finally, we
tackle nitrogen chemistry.

he chapters in this part examine metabolism — all the processes involved
in maintaining a cell. Metabolism has two components: catabolism and
anabolism. Catabolism deals with the breaking down of molecules, whereas
anabolism deals with the building up of cells. Both processes take place in
the mitochondria. All metabolic processes involve energy: They either absorb
energy (endergonic) or produce it (exergonic).
The key energy molecule is adenosine triphosphate, abbreviated ATP, which
forms as a product of the common catabolic pathway. 
ATP: The Energy Pony Express
Determining the basic reaction processes involved in the production and use
of energy is called bioenergetics. This study has developed bioenergetic prin-
ciples that allow us to examine energy at the microscopic level.
Fortunately, ATP is recycled within the body. The typical daily requirement
for an adult is over 140 pounds of ATP per day. However, the amount of ATP
present in your body at any one time is only about one-tenth of a pound. That
means each ATP molecule in your body is recycled about 1,400 times each day.
Now that is effective recycling — and you don’t even have to put anything into
a blue container.

ATP and free energy
The free energy content (G) is the intrinsic energy present in a molecule. In a
reaction, the change in this energy is written as ∆G. The change in energy is
equal to the energy of the products minus the energy of the reactants. The
value of ∆G is the key: If a reaction produces energy, ∆G represents the maxi-
mum possible amount of energy that the reaction may produce. If a reaction
requires energy, ∆G represents the minimum possible amount of energy that
a reaction will require. Reactions producing energy have a negative value of
∆G and are spontaneous. Reactions requiring energy have a positive value of
∆G and are nonspontaneous.
Spontaneity bears no relation to speed. Spontaneous reactions may be very
rapid or very slow.
The conditions under which a reaction occurs may alter the value of ∆G. (The
“ideal” or standard value of ∆G is ∆G°.) The formula for modifying the free
energy for the equilibrium reaction A B is:
∆G = ∆G° – RT ln [B] / [A] = ∆G° – RT ln K
According to this relationship, the free energy change, ∆G, comes from a
modification of the standard free energy value. R is the universal gas constant
(8.314 J × mol-1K-1 or 1.987 cal × mol-1K-1). T is the absolute temperature. K is
the equilibrium constant found by dividing the concentration of the product,
[B], by the concentration of the reactant, [A].
In many bioenergetic studies, calories are the unit instead of joules (J). The
relationship is 1 calorie = 4.184 J (exactly) or 1 kilocalorie = 4.184 kJ.
In research, it is often better to use ∆G°'. This modification of ∆G stems from
the use of the biologically more realistic value of pH = 7 ([H+] = 10-7 M) instead
of the standard pH = 0 ([H+] = 1 M). Some relationships between K and ∆G°'
are shown in Table 12-1.

Table 12-1 shows that the larger K is, the more exergonic (spontaneous) the
reaction. For example, if K = 1000, the concentration of the product, [B], is
1,000 times that of the reactant, [A], and 17 kJ per mole will be released. It is
important to remember that, in biological systems, variations in [A] and [B]
must be taken into account in addition to ∆G°'. For example, increasing the
reactant concentration promotes the reaction, whereas increasing the prod-
uct concentration inhibits the reaction.
ATP as an energy transporter
Cells utilize exergonic processes to provide the energy necessary for life
processes, and the key supplier of this energy is ATP (Figure 12-1). ATP sup-
plies the energy required to force endergonic reactions to take place, to pro-
vide mechanical energy (muscle movement), light energy (in fireflies), and
heat energy (to maintain body temperature).
Hydrolysis of the terminal phosphate of ATP yields ADP and inorganic phos-
phate, indicated as Pi. The structure of ADP is shown in Figure 12-2. This
hydrolysis releases 30.5 kJ × mol-1.

It is also possible to go directly from ATP to AMP, cleaving a pyrophosphate,
P2O7
4–, from the phosphate chain. Biochemists use PPi to indicate pyrophos-
phate. This furnishes slightly more energy then a simple hydrolysis to release
Pi (about 33.5 kJ × mol-1). Under physiological conditions, the phosphate 
portions of ATP and ADP form a complex with magnesium ions. In certain 
circumstances, manganese (II) ions, Mn2+, may take the place of Mg2+ ions.

The removal of the last phosphate involves the loss of the least amount of
energy (14.2 kJ•mol-1). This hydrolysis involves the cleavage of an ester bond
instead of an anhydride bond. In general, the hydrolysis of an ester bond
involves less than half the energy of the hydrolysis of an anhydride bond.
It’s Relative: Molecules Related to ATP
A few other biomolecules can provide energy equivalent to that which comes
from the hydrolysis of ATP. GTP is an example of such a molecule. There are
also a few molecules that supply more energy. Table 12-2 compares some of
the high-energy molecules to ATP, and Figure 12-5 shows their structures.

Phosphopyruvate, 1,3-bisphosphogylcerate, and acetyl phosphate are impor-
tant for the transfer and conservation of chemical energy. Phosphoarginine
and phosphocreatine are important molecules for storing metabolic energy.
Phosphocreatine is stored in muscles and can be quickly converted to ATP 
to give energy for muscle contraction. Production of phosphocreatine occurs
when ATP concentration is high — high ATP concentration is needed to over-
come the energy deficit of 12.8 kJ × mol-1. The reverse, phosphate transfer to
form ATP from ADP, occurs at low ATP concentrations. Phosphoarginine
behaves similarly in certain invertebrates.
The nucleoside triphosphate family
The predominant energy transfer molecule, as we have been saying, is ATP.
But other nucleoside triphosphates (such as CTP, GTP, TTP, and UTP) may
also serve this energy transfer function. These five molecules also supply
part of the energy necessary for DNA and RNA synthesis. All the nucleoside
190

triphosphates have about the same energy yield. (Note that ATP is necessary
for the synthesis of the remaining nucleoside triphosphates.)

Chapter 12: Life and Energy

The biosynthesis of the ribonucleoside triphosphates, in general NTP, begins
with the production of the appropriate monophosphate, NMP. The stepwise
addition of the next two phosphate groups requires two enzymes of low
specificity. These enzymes are nucleoside monophosphate kinase and nucle-
oside diphosphate kinase. (The term kinase refers to a transferase enzyme
that transfers a phosphate group of a nucleoside triphosphate.) The general
reactions are shown in Figure 12-6.
The formation of the deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates, dNTP, follows two
different paths. In one path, a multienzyme system converts the appropriate
nucleoside diphosphate to the corresponding deoxyribonucleoside diphos-
phate. Then nucleoside diphosphate kinase catalyzes the formation of the
deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate. The other path occurs in certain micro-
organisms where there is a direct conversion of NTP to dNTP.
As easy as 1, 2, 3: AMP, ADP, and ATP
It is possible to hydrolyze ATP either to ADP plus phosphate, Pi, or to AMP
plus pyrophosphate, PPi. (The pyrophosphate will undergo further hydrolysis
to two phosphates, 2 Pi.) ADP and Pi are the immediate precursors for the
reformation of ATP. To produce ATP starting with AMP utilizes the enzyme
adenylate kinase. This enzyme catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group
from an ATP to an ADP. This reaction results in the formation of two ADP 
molecules. (Adenylate kinase also catalyzes the reverse reaction.) 
The easy transfer of phosphate groups between nucleotides creates a meta-
bolic network for the transfer of energy. The key to this network is the inter-
cellular production of ATP.

Where It All Comes From 
One of the purposes of the food we eat, of course, is to supply energy, with
carbohydrates and fats being the major sources of energy. Digestion breaks
polysaccharides into glucose and other monosaccharides, whereas fats are
broken into glycerol and fatty acids. Catabolism converts these energy sources
primarily to ATP. Proteins are broken into amino acids, which usually do not
serve as energy sources. (We explain the details of these reactions later in
this book.) Glucose produces 36 ATP molecules. This is an average of 6 ATPs
per carbon. The step-by-step energy change for glucose is in Table 12-3. Other
carbohydrates give a similar yield.

Each fat molecule hydrolyzes to a glycerol and three fatty acid molecules.
Glycerol produces 20 ATPs per molecule. The energy production from a fatty
acid will vary with the identity of the particular acid. Stearic acid, C18H36O2,
produces a total of 146 ATPs per molecule. This amounts to an average of 8.1
ATPs per carbon. The step-by-step energy change for stearic acid is shown in
Table 12-4. Other fatty acids give a similar yield.

Starvation is the total deprivation of food. Here is
what happens during starvation: Initially, the
body utilizes its glycogen reserves. Then it moves
on to its fat reserves — the first ones are those
around the heart and kidneys. Finally, the body
relies on the reserves found in the bone marrow.
Early in a total fast, the body metabolizes protein
at a rapid rate. The amino acids are converted to
glucose, because the brain prefers glucose.
These proteins come from the skeletal muscles,
blood plasma, and other sources in a process
that produces a quantity of nitrogen-containing
products, which need to be excreted. Excretion
requires large quantities of water, and the result-
ing loss of water may lead to death by dehydra-
tion. If the starvation continues, the brain
chemistry adjusts to accept fatty acid metabo-
lites, which uses the last of the fat reserves.
Finally, the body resorts to structural proteins,
systems begin to fail rapidly, and death follows
quickly.

ere we examine a number of general processes that either produce or
consume energy. Breaking down molecules often produces energy. The
breakdown of one molecule is often coupled with the synthesis of another,
and this other synthesized molecule is often adenosine triphosphate, or ATP.
Catabolism is the breaking down of molecules to provide energy. Anabolism is
the building of molecules. These two processes combine to give metabolism.
Metabolism comprises all reactions in biological systems.
As you can see in Chapter 12, the “currency” in biological systems is ATP.
There are other energy-containing molecules, but the rate of exchange to 
ATP is the reference. The breakdown of certain molecules produces the cur-
rency of ATP, and there is a cost involved in the synthesis of other molecules.
Polysaccharides and fats are like “banks” that store energy for later use. 
Metabolism I: Glycolysis
The Embden-Meyerhof pathway, or glycolysis, is a primitive means of extract-
ing energy from organic molecules. The process converts glucose to two
lactic acid molecules in an anaerobic (without oxygen) process. Nearly all
forms of life, whether a person or a jellyfish, utilize glycolysis. All carbohy-
drates follow this pathway. Aerobic (utilizing oxygen) processing of carbohy-
drates uses pyruvate derived from glycolysis. (Alcoholic fermentation also
produces pyruvate from glucose. The glucose is converted to two ethanol
molecules and two CO2 molecules.) Glycolysis is a two-part process, which
we label Phase I and Phase II. Figures 13-1 and 13-2 help illustrate the upcom-
ing, ahem, rather involved discussion. You may want to refer back to these
figures as you read.

Glucose: Where it all starts
As we mentioned, glycolysis occurs in two phases: Phase I and Phase II.
Phase I
As glucose enters the cell, it undergoes immediate phosphorylation to glucose-
6-phosphate — the first step in Phase I. The phosphate comes from ATP, and
the enzyme hexokinase, with the aid of Mg2+, catalyzes the transfer. Thus, the
first step in the production of energy requires an investment of energy, which
is necessary to activate the glucose in a reaction that is not easy to reverse.
In addition, the presence of the charged phosphate group makes it difficult
for this and other intermediates to diffuse out of the cell.
The enzyme phosphoglucose isomerase then catalyzes the isomerization of
glucose-6-phosphate to fructose-6-phosphate. This results in a compound
with a primary alcohol group, which is easier to phosphorylate than the
hemiacetal originally present. Fructose-6-phosphate then reacts with another
molecule of ATP to form fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. The enzyme for this step
is phosphofructokinase — (try saying that ten times fast!) — and this enzyme
requires Mg2+ to be active. This is the major regulatory step in glycolysis. ATP
inhibits this enzyme, whereas AMP activates it.
Aldolase enzymatically cleaves the fructose-1,6-bisphosphate into two triose
phosphates. These triose phosphates are dihydroxyacetone phosphate and
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate. The dihydroxyacetone phosphate isomerizes to
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate to complete Phase I. Triose phosphate iso-
merase catalyzes this isomerization. (You see why we suggested following
along with Figures 13-1 and 13-2?)
The net result of Phase I is the formation of two molecules of glyceraldehyde-
3-phosphate, which costs two ATP molecules, and produces no energy.
Phase II
Phase II begins with the simultaneous phosphorylation and oxidation of glyc-
eraldehyde-3-phosphate to form 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate. Glyceraldehyde-3-
phosphate dehydrogenase catalyzes this conversion. Inorganic phosphate is
the source of the phosphate. NAD+ is the coenzyme and oxidizing agent. NAD+
reduces to NADH.
There is a high-energy acyl phosphate bond present in 1,3-bisphosphoglycer-
ate. Phosphoglycerate kinase, in the presence of Mg2+, catalyzes the direct
transfer of phosphate from 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate to ADP. This results in
the formation of ATP and 3-phosphoglycerate. Because the formation of ATP
involves direct phosphate transfer, this process is called substrate-level phos-
phorylation to avoid confusion with oxidative phosphorylation (discussed
later). Phosphoglyceromutase then catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate
198
Part IV: Bioenergetics and Pathways 

group from C-2 to C-3, thus converting 3-phosphoglycerate to 2-phosphoglyc-
erate. After that, dehydration occurs to form phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP),
which contains a nigh-energy phosphate bond. The enzyme catalyzing the
reaction is enolase.
The final, irreversible step is a second substrate-level phosphorylation. Here,
an ADP molecule receives a phosphate group from the PEP. The enzyme pyru-
vate kinase is necessary for this step. This enzyme requires not Mg2+, but also
K+. Pyruvate is the other product. Whew!
During Phase II, two molecules of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (from Phase I)
form two molecules of pyruvate with the formation of four molecules of ATP
and two molecules of NADH.
The pyruvate produced by glycolysis has several fates. When there is plenty
of oxygen, the pyruvate enters the Krebs cycle, the electron transport chain,
and oxidative phosphorylation pathways as Acetyl-CoA. This results in the
production of more ATP and the total conversion to CO2. If oxygen is lacking,
vertebrates (you included) convert pyruvate to a related substance, lactate.
Other organisms, such as yeast, convert pyruvate to ethanol and CO2 — and
that is why we have beer. These latter two possible fates yield less energy
than the oxygen-rich fate.
Miles per gallon? Energy efficiency
Glycolysis is the initial conversion of carbohydrate to energy. After that there
is the production of two ATP molecules, two NADH molecules, and two pyru-
vate molecules. The energy content of the ATP molecules is only 2 percent 
of the total energy present in each glucose molecule. This shows the relative
inefficiency of anaerobic energy production. Fortunately, the pyruvate mole-
cules will undergo further aerobic oxidation to increase this energy yield. The
total energy output of anaerobic and aerobic oxidation of glucose is 30–32
ATP molecules, which accounts for about 30 percent of the total energy pre-
sent in glucose. Much of the remaining energy is available as heat for warm-
blooded animals.
Going in reverse: Gluconeogenesis
Gluconeogenesis is a series of reactions that generate glucose from non-
carbohydrate sources. This pathway is necessary when the supply of carbo-
hydrates is inadequate (something that is rare in our lives). The non-
carbohydrate sources include lactate, pyruvate, some amino acids, and glyc-
erol. In many ways, gluconeogenesis is the reverse of glycolysis. Figure 13-3
summarizes the steps of gluconeogenesis. (The formation of glucose in plants
utilizes the process of photosynthesis.)

The presence of many of the same intermediates enables the use of many of
the same enzymes in both glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. The differences
(four enzymes) between the two systems allow regulation, so that the
processes don’t cancel each other. Regulation is also possible by isolating 
the two pathways in different organs. Other carbohydrates may also form. 
Alcoholic fermentation: We’ll drink to that
Under anaerobic conditions, yeast and other organisms convert pyruvate to
ethanol and carbon dioxide. This process is accompanied by the oxidation of
NADH to NAD+. The NAD+ is used in glycolysis. During this process, there is a
net generation of two ATP molecules.
The first step in alcoholic fermentation is the decarboxylation of pyruvate to
carbon dioxide and acetaldehyde. The enzyme pyruvate decarboxylase, along
with the cofactors Mg2+ and TPP (thiamin pyrophosphate), catalyze this step.
The enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase, along with the coenzyme NADH, cat-
alyzes the conversion of acetaldehyde to ethanol. Makes you really appreci-
ate that shot of tequila, doesn’t it? Figure 13-4 summarizes these steps.

Metabolism II: Citric Acid (Krebs) Cycle
The citric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation are the aerobic processes
of catabolism that produce energy (ATP). The citric acid cycle is also known
as the Krebs cycle and also as the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA). The primary
entry molecule for this series of reactions is acetyl-CoA (short for acetyl-
coenzyme A). The sources of acetyl-CoA are pyruvate from glycolysis, certain
amino acids, or the fatty acids present in fats. The structure of acetyl-CoA is
shown in Figure 13-5. Note: these processes take place in the mitochondria,
the energy factories of the cell.

Part IV: Bioenergetics and Pathways 

Let’s get started: Synthesis of acetyl-CoA
The synthesis of acetyl-CoA is a multi-step process. Figure 13-8 shows a sim-
plified version of this process.
These steps are coupled to preserve the free energy produced by the decar-
boxylation. In the first step, pyruvate combines with TPP (thiamin pyrophos-
phate) and undergoes decarboxylation. The pyruvate dehydrogenase
component of the multi-enzyme complex catalyzes this step. During the
second step, the TPP undergoes oxidation, which yields an acetyl group
(refer back to Figure 13-8). This acetyl group transfers to lipomide. In this
reaction, the oxidant is the disulfide group of lipomide, and acetyllipoamide
forms in this step. The pyruvate dehydrogenase component also catalyzes
this reaction. In the final step, the acetyl group of acetyllipoamide transfer to
CoA to form acetyl CoA. The catalyst for this reaction is dihydrolipoyl
transacetylase. 
However, the process does not end with the formation of acetyl CoA. It is
necessary to regenerate the oxidized form of lopoamide. The enzyme dihy-
drolipoyl dehydrogenase catalyzes this step. The two electrons from the oxi-
dation transfer to FAD and then to NAD+. Some of the important intermediates
in these steps are shown in Figure 13-9.

Three’s a crowd: Tricarboxylic acids
When acetyl-CoA enters the citric acid cycle, it interacts, in the presence of
citrate synthase, with oxaloacetate. This interaction results in the transfer 
of the acetyl group to the oxaloacetate to form citrate. The hydrolysis of the
thioester linkage of the acetyl-CoA releases a large amount of energy. 
The enzyme aconitase, with Fe2+ as a cofactor, catalyzes the isomerization of
citrate to isocitrate. For a time, cis-aconitate, derived aconitase, was thought
to be a part of the citric acid cycle. However, even though the structure of
cis-aconitate is related to the other tricarboxylic acids, it is not part of the
citric acid cycle. The structure of cis-aconitate is in Figure 13-10.
Just a little gas: Oxidative decarboxylation
The next step is the conversion of isocitrate to α-ketoglutarate. The molecule
passes through the intermediate oxalosuccinate. The isocitrate binds to the
enzyme isocitrate dehydrogenase. During this process, the coenzyme NAD+
undergoes reduction. Both ATP and NADH are negative factors in the allosteric
regulation of isocitrate dehydrogenase, whereas ADP is a positive factor. This
is an important mechanism to control the production of ATP.

Production of succinate and GTP
The conversion of α-ketoglutarate to succinate requires two steps. The α-
ketoglutarate must bind to the enzyme to form an α-ketoglutarate dehydroge-
nase complex. This reaction requires the same cofactors as needed for the
formation of acetyl-CoA. The result of this reaction is the elimination of carbon
dioxide and the formation of succinyl-CoA. This process is irreversible under
physiological conditions.
In the second step, succinyl-CoA separates to form succinate and release
energy, which is harnessed by the conversion of GDP to GTP. This substrate-
level phosphorylation is catalyzed by succinyl-CoA synthetase. (GTP contains
about the same energy as ATP and can substitute for ATP.)
Oxaloacetate regeneration
The regeneration of oxaloacetate completes the cycle, requiring three reac-
tions which, together, convert a methylene to a carbonyl group. First, a
hydrogen atom is removed from each of two adjacent carbon atoms, resulting
in the formation of a double bond. Next, a water molecule adds to the double
bond. Finally, the removal of two hydrogen atoms yields the appropriate α-
keto group. Succinate dehydrogenase catalyzes the first of these reactions.
The prosthetic group, FAD, accepts the two hydrogen atoms by covalently
binding to the enzyme. Fumarase catalyzes the next step. The final oxidation
utilizes the enzyme malate dehydrogenase with the coenzyme NAD+. The
oxaloacetate is now ready to begin the cycle again.

Amino acids as energy sources
Although carbohydrates are the most readily available energy source, there
are situations where amino acids can serve as energy sources. This is impor-
tant for carnivores (like ourselves), who live on a high protein diet. The uti-
lization of amino acids as energy sources is also important during
hypoglycemia, fasting, and starvation.
The process begins with the removal of the amino group. This usually occurs
through transamination, which is the transfer of an amino group from one
molecule to another. Any amino acid other than threonine, proline, and lysine
will undergo this process. Usually, the amino group transfers to the keto
carbon of α-ketoglutarate, oxalatoacetate, or pyruvate to form glutamate,
aspartate, or alanine, respectively. Specific transaminases are necessary and
the coenzyme pyridoxal phosphate catalyzes this process. A second transam-
ination is involved in the process of transforming aspartate and alanine to
glutamate.
Oxidative deamination converts glutamate to α-ketoglutarate. This process,
which occurs primarily in the liver, releases an ammonium ion. The reverse
reaction, glutamate synthesis, is one of the few reactions that occurs in ani-
mals in which inorganic nitrogen is converted into organic nitrogen. The
ammonium ion resulting from oxidative deamination may enter one or more
biosynthetic pathways or the urea cycle. Most vertebrates convert the
ammonium ion to urea, which is excreted in the urine. Most marine organ-
isms, including fish, eliminate ammonia directly, whereas birds, insects, and
reptiles convert the ammonium ion to uric acid.
The products of transamination, oxidative deamination, and further modifica-
tion of the remaining portion of the amino acid produce one of the intermedi-
ates in glycolysis or the citric acid cycle. This is the fate of all the amino
acids — some of the amino acids go through one intermediate, whereas
others require more intermediates. Figure 13-11 shows where each of the
amino acids enters glycolysis or the citric acid (Krebs) cycle. Some of 
the amino acids have more than one entry point.

Electron Transport and Oxidative
Phosphorylation
The production of NADH and FADH2 by the citric acid cycle supplies the
materials for the next phase: oxidative phosphorylation. These reduced 
coenzymes transport the electrons derived from the oxidation of pyruvate.
The final fate of these electrons is the reduction of oxygen to water.
The details of oxidation phosphorylation are not as easy to study as glycoly-
sis and the citric acid cycle because the processes take place within the mito-
chondria, where many of the proteins involved are integrated into the walls.
In addition, many of the processes are coupled. The separate components of
a coupled process must not only be in close proximity, but often need to be 
in a specific arrangement.
The electron transport system
A number of species in the mitochondria must undergo oxidation-reduction
reactions. Oxidation involves a loss of electrons, whereas reduction involves
a gain of electrons. These processes are coupled in that the electrons lost
must equal the electrons gained. The reduction potential indicates how easily
a molecule undergoes oxidation or reduction. The molecular players that are
important to the electron transport system are the pyridine-linked dehydro-
genases, flavin-linked dehydrogenases, iron-sulfur proteins, ubiquinones, and
cytochromes.
Off on a tangent: Dealing with reduction potentials
The standard for reduction potentials is the reaction:
2 H+(aq) + 2 e-
H2(g)
Under standard conditions (25°C, PH2 = 1 atm, and [H+] = 1.0 M), the standard
reduction potential is E° = 0.00 V. Under physiological conditions in humans the
value is –0.42 V (designated as E'°), because the conditions are not standard.
Table 13-1 lists a number of physiological reduction potentials. We show you
how to use these entries later. The values in the table are arranged in order of
increasing potential. The higher the value, the better the reaction is at oxida-
tion, and the lower the value, the better the reaction is at reduction.

Each reaction in Table 13-1 is known as a half-reaction. It takes two half-
reactions — one oxidation and one reduction — to produce a complete 
(oxidation-reduction) reaction. The electrons lost (oxidation) must equal 
the electrons gained (reduction). For this reason, electrons only appear in the
half-reaction, but never in the overall reaction.
By convention, the reactions in Table 13-1 all appear as reduction half-reactions.
To convert any of these to an oxidation half-reaction, you must do two things.
First, reverse the reaction, and then reverse the sign of E'°. In an oxidation-
reduction reaction, the overall reaction is created by combining (adding) an
oxidation reaction with a reduction reaction. Before adding the two reactions,
though, make sure that the electrons in each reaction are equal. This may
require multiplying one or both of the reactions by a value to make sure the
211
Chapter 13: ATP: The Body’s Monetary System

electrons are equal. (Multiply the reactions only — do not change the value
of E'° [other than a sign change].) For example, look at the following reac-
tions from the table:
NAD+ + 2 e-
NADH 
–0.32
Cytochrome b-Fe3+ + e-
Cytochrome b-Fe2+
+0.075
Let’s now change the first reaction to an oxidation:
NADH NAD+ + H+ + 2 e-
+0.32
If we now want to combine these reactions, we need to multiply the
cytochrome reaction by two (so both reactions now involve two electrons):
2 Cytochrome b-Fe3+ + 2 e-
2 Cytochrome b-Fe2+ +0.08
The number of electrons lost must equal to electrons gained. Also, notice
that only the reaction is doubled, not the voltage. We can now combine these
two reactions, canceling the electrons from both sides:
NADH NAD+ + H+ + 2 e-
+0.32 V
2 Cytochrome b-Fe3+ + 2 e-  2 Cytochrome b-Fe2+
+0.08 V
NADH + H+ + 2 Cytochrome b-Fe3+
2Cytochrome b-Fe2+ + NAD+ + 2H++0.40 V
The final reaction will have no electrons. Other species may cancel, if they
appear on both sides of the reaction arrow. Any time the sum of the two
potentials is positive, the reaction produces energy. Conversely, a negative
value means the reaction requires energy. The greater the value of the sum,
the greater the amount of energy produced.
Pyridine-linked dehydrogenases
In order for these enzymes to function, the coenzymes NAD+ or NADP+ are
necessary. The coenzymes may be in either the oxidized or the reduced
forms. If the general form of the substrate in the reduced form is Z-H2, and 
in the oxidized form, it is Z, then the reaction will be:
Z-H2 + NAD+ (or NADP+) Z + NADH (or NADPH) + H+
There are more than 200 pyridine-linked dehydrogenases. The majority of
NAD+-linked dehydrogenases are involved in aerobic respiration. Most of 
the NADP+-linked dehydrogenases are involved in biosynthesis.
212
Part IV: Bioenergetics and Pathways 

Flavin-linked dehydrogenases
Enzymes (E) of this type require FAD or FMN as tightly bound prosthetic
groups or coenzymes. Again, the species may be in either the oxidized or 
the reduced forms. The general reactions of this type are:
Z-H2 + E-FAD Z + E-FADH2
Z-H2 + E-FMN Z + E-FMNH2
NADH dehydrogenase, which contains the prosthetic group FMN, is the
enzyme responsible for transporting electrons from NADH to the next 
acceptor in the electrons transport chain. There are other flavin-linked 
dehydrogenases — for example, succinate dehydrogenase.
Iron-sulfur proteins
The chief characteristics of iron-sulphur proteins are the presence of iron
and sulfur, as S2-. The electron transporting ability of these proteins is the
Fe2+/Fe3+ couple. Several of these proteins are associated with the electron
transport chain, where they are complexed to other respiratory species.
Examples include succinate dehydrogenase, with two iron-sulfur centers, 
and NADH dehydrogenase, with four iron-sulfur centers.
Ubiquinones
The ubiquinones are a group of coenzymes that are fat-soluble. Coenzyme Q
(CoQ) is an example of an ubiquinone. The oxidation-reduction center is a
derivation of quinine, and the fat-solubility is enhanced by the presence of a
long hydrocarbon chain, containing a series of isoprene units. Many of the
different ubiquinones differ only in the number of isoprene units present. The
oxidized form of coenzyme Q is simply CoQ whereas the reduced form is
CoQH2. The general structures of both the oxidized and reduced forms of a
ubiquinone appear in Figure 13-12.
Cytochromes
The cytochromes are a group of proteins containing a heme group. Like the
iron-sulfur proteins, the oxidation-reduction couple is Fe2+/Fe3+. The three gen-
eral classes of cytochromes are a, b, and c. The derivation of the class names
relates to spectral studies done during the first isolation of these molecules.
Cytochromes occur in both the mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum.
The heme group, present in all cytochromes, is like the heme groups present
in myoglobin and hemoglobin. In all cases, the central portion of the group is
identical; differences derive from the attachment of side-chains to the heme
core. Figure 13-13 shows the heme core and where the side-chains normally
attach.

Five cytochromes (a, a3, b, c, and c1) have been identified as part of the elec-
tron transport chain of mammals. Cytochrome c, or cyt c, is easy to extract
from cells, and therefore it is the most studied of the cytochromes. The 
structure of cytochrome c from different species is important to the study 
of biochemical evolution. Cytochromes a and a3, cyt aa3, occur together as 
a complex containing not only the expected two heme groups, but also two
copper ions. The copper ions are part of another oxidation-reduction couple
(Cu+/Cu2+). This complex, known as cytochrome oxidase, is the terminal
cytochrome, which transfers electrons to O2.
Interpersonal relationships
The members of the electron transport chain are grouped into four complexes
with coenzyme Q (CoQ) and cytochrome c (cyt c) serving as links. One way
of indicating the sequence of events in the electron transport chain appears
in Figure 13-14. Figure 13-15 illustrates the same sequence emphasizing the
cyclic nature of the steps. The processes take place in four complexes with
linking CoQ and cytochrome c. These complexes are part of the inner mito-
chondrial membrane.

The script: Oxidative phosphorylation
The processes of oxidative phosphorylation and the electron transport chain
are closely coupled. It is only possible to oxidize the reduced forms of the
coenzymes FADH2 and NADH in the presence of ADP. The oxidations couple
with the ADP transforming to ATP (phosphorylation).
If we calculate the oxidation-reduction potentials for NADH and FADH2 reduc-
ing oxygen, we find:
NADH NAD+ + H+ + 2 e-
+0.32 V
1/2 O2 + 2 H+ + 2 e-  H2O
+0.82 V
1/2 O2 + H+ + NADH H2O + NAD+
+1.14 V
And:
FADH2
FAD + 2 H+ + 2 e-
+0.22 V
1/2 O2 + 2 H+ + 2 e-  H2O
+0.82 V
1/2 O2 + FADH2
H2O + FAD
+1.04 V
In both cases, the combination of the potentials is positive. Positive poten-
tials refer to spontaneous processes, and spontaneous processes produce
energy. Each NADH is capable of supplying sufficient energy to produce 2.5
ATP, and each FADH2 can produce 1.5 ATP.
The play: Proposed mechanisms
The current proposed mechanism for oxidative phosphorylation is the
chemiosmotic hypothesis. This hypothesis assumes that the hydrogen ion gra-
dient is a significant factor promoting the conversion of ADP to ATP. The
processes occurring in the four complexes present in the inner mitochondrial
membrane result in a net transfer of hydrogen ions across the membrane.
The hydrogen ion transfer results in an increase in the hydrogen ion concen-
tration in the space between the inner and outer mitochondrial membranes.
It is necessary to move hydrogen ions back across the membrane. This trans-
fer of hydrogen ions is necessary in the synthesis of ATP.
218
Part IV: Bioenergetics and Pathways 

The box office: ATP production
The reactions from the anaerobic oxidation of glucose (glycolysis) and the
aerobic oxidation of glucose result in the production of 32 molecules of ATP
from every molecule of glucose. These reactions are:
Anaerobic:
Glucose + 2 NAD+ + 2 ADP + 2 Pi →2 Pyruvate + 2 NADH + 2 H+ + 2 H2O + 
2 ATP
Aerobic:
2 Pyruvate + 5 O2 + 30 ADP + 30 Pi →6 CO2 + 34 H2O + 30 ATP
Sum:
Glucose + 2 NAD+ + 5 O2 + 32 ADP + 32 Pi →6 CO2 + 36 H2O + 2 NADH + 
2 H+ + 32 ATP
Involving the fats: β-oxidation cycle
Fatty acids may also serve as a source of ATP. Accomplishing this requires a
series of reactions, known as β-oxidation, or the fatty acid spiral, to break
down the fatty acid molecule. This series of reactions is a cyclic process.
Some of the processes are oxidations, which require the coenzymes NAD+
and FAD. This process also occurs in the mitochondria. The initiation of fatty
acid oxidation requires activation of the relatively unreactive fatty acid mole-
cule. The activated form is analogous to acetyl-CoA. In this case, the coen-
zyme A binds to the fatty acid to form a fatty acyl-CoA. Activation requires
acyl-CoA synthetase and one molecule of ATP. The ATP uses two phosphates
and becomes AMP.
At the inner mitochondrial membrane, the fatty acyl-CoA combines with the
carrier molecule carnitine. Carnitine acyltransferase catalyzes this transfer.
The fatty acyl-carnitine transports into the mitochondrial matrix, where it
converts back to fatty acyl-CoA. With the mitochondrial matrix, a series of
four reactions constitute the cycle known as β-oxidation. The name of this
process refers to the oxidation of the second (β) followed by the loss of two
carbons from the carboxyl end of the fatty acyl-CoA. Each trip around the
cycle results in the removal of two carbon atoms, and the cycle continues
until all the carbon atoms are removed. Figure 13-16 illustrates the general
aspects of the cycle.

Part IV: Bioenergetics and Pathways 

The first step in the cycle is an oxidation, with the catalyst being acyl-CoA
dehydrogenase. During this step, coenzyme FAD accepts two hydrogen
atoms. One of the hydrogen atoms is from the α carbon, and the other is from
the β carbon atom. The process is stereospecific, producing the trans form.
Elsewhere, the FADH2 undergoes re-oxidation to FAD with the production of
1.5 molecules of ATP.
The trans-alkene undergoes hydration to form a secondary alcohol in the
second step. The catalyst is the enzyme enoyl-CoA hydratase — a stereospe-
cific enzyme yielding only the L isomer. Next, the secondary alcohol undergoes
oxidation to form a ketone. The oxidizing agent is NAD+. The enzyme catalyzing
this oxidation is β-hydroxy-acyl-CoA dehydrogenase. The re-oxidation of NADH
to NAD+ via the electron transport chain produces two molecules of ATP.
The final step involves the cleavage of the β-ketoacyl-CoA with a molecule of
CoA. This produces acetyl-CoA and a fatty acyl-CoA two carbon atoms
shorter than the original. The enzyme from this step is β-ketothiolase (or
simply thiolase). The new fatty acyl-CoA goes around the cycle to be short-
ened by two carbon atoms. An unsaturated fatty acid also goes through simi-
lar steps, but needs one or two additional enzymes.
The energy yield from a fatty acid is larger than from glucose. The process
begins with the activation of the fatty acid, which costs the equivalent of two
ATP molecules. Each trip around the cycle yields ten molecules of ATP, a mol-
ecule of FADH2, and a molecule of NADH. The NADH and FADH2 ultimately
yield four additional molecules of ATP. Thus, each trip around the cycle pro-
duces 14 molecules of ATP. In addition, the final trip around the cycle pro-
duces not one but two molecules of acetyl-CoA.
Not so heavenly bodies: Ketone bodies
Some of the excess acetyl-CoA will form a group of relatively small molecules
called ketone bodies. This is especially important when there is a build up of
acetyl-CoA. A build up may occur when the rate of production is too high or 
if it is not used efficiently. Two acetyl-CoA molecules combine in the reverse
of the last step in β-oxidation to produce acetoacetyl-CoA. Acetoacetyl-CoA
reacts with water and another acetyl-CoA to form β-hydroxy-β-methylglutaryl-
CoA, which in turn cleaves to acetoacetate and acetyl-CoA. Most of the ace-
toacetate undergoes reduction to β-hydroxybutyrate (a small amount
decarboxylates to acetone and carbon dioxide). These steps appear in 
Figure 13-17.

The other guy
When a fat molecule breaks down, the results are
a glycerol and three fatty acid molecules. The
fatty acid molecules enter the β-oxidation cycle
and produce energy. Catabolism of the glycerol
also serves as a source of energy. First, the glyc-
erol is phosphorylated to glycerol 1-phosphate 
(= glycerol 3-phosphate). This uses one molecule
of ATP. Oxidation of glycerol 1-phosphate gener-
ates dihydroxyacetone phosphate, which can
enter the glycolysis pathway. The net energy pro-
duction is from 16.5 to 18.5 molecules of ATP.

As a group, acetone, β-hydroxybutyrate, and acetoacetate are the ketone
bodies.
This process occurs primarily in the liver, and the β-hydroxybutyrate and
acetoacetate then enter the bloodstream for use by other tissues. During pro-
longed starvation, ketone bodies may serve as the major energy source for
some tissues. The kidneys excrete excess ketone bodies. Normal blood levels
are about 1 mg of ketone bodies per 100 mL of blood.
In starvation or diabetes mellitus, a form of diabetes, cells may not receive
sufficient carbohydrate for energy, leading to an increase in the rate of fatty
acid oxidation to compensate for the energy deficit. As the amount of acetyl-
CoA increases, there is insufficient oxaloacetate in the citric acid cycle avail-
able for oxidation of this acetyl-CoA. (The oxaloacetate concentration is
lower because of the necessity of using it for glucose synthesis.) This leads 
to an increase in the production of ketone bodies and an increase of ketone
bodies in the bloodstream. At 3 mg of ketone bodies per 100 mL, a condition
known as ketonemia arises — a high concentration of ketone bodies in the
urine. Ketonemia and ketonuria are two aspects of ketosis.
Two of the ketone bodies are in the form of acids. The build up of ketone
bodies leads to an overwhelming of the blood buffers. The decrease in blood
pH may reach 0.5 units lower than the normal pH (7.4), leading to acidosis, a
serious condition, which, among other things, leads to difficulty in oxygen
transport by hemoglobin. Dehydration results as the kidneys eliminate large
quantities of liquid trying to remove the excess acid. Severe acidosis may
result in a coma that may result in death.
Mammals cannot convert acetyl-CoA to carbohydrates. It is possible to con-
vert carbohydrates to fats, but not to do the reverse.
Investing in the Future: Biosynthesis
One aspect of metabolism, catabolism, is to produce the energy required for
life. Another aspect, anabolism, is to supply the materials for growth and
replacement. Food supplies the raw fuel for metabolism. A number of path-
ways are available to allow for flexibility. It is necessary to block some 
pathways to overcome Le Châtelier’s Principle, partly because an enzyme 
will catalyze both the forward and the reverse reaction. 
Nearly all intermediates in catabolic processes are also intermediates in ana-
bolic processes. Molecules may easily change from one pathway to another.
In general, anabolic processes require the energy produced by catabolic
processes. We’ve already seen one aspect of anabolism — gluconeogenesis.
Earlier, we saw how this process, related to glycolysis, could generate glu-
cose and other carbohydrates. We examine other biosynthesis processes in
this section.
223
Chapter 13: ATP: The Body’s Monetary System

Fatty acids
Production of the fatty acids is necessary to form the membrane lipids. But
the main reason for fatty acid synthesis is to convert excess dietary carbohy-
drate to fats for storage. The key molecule for this is acetyl-CoA.
The liver is the primary fatty acid synthesis site in humans, and humans can
synthesize all the fatty acids but two: linoleic acid and linolenic acid. Linoleic
acid and linolenic acid are also essential fatty acids, required components of
the diet. Acetyl-CoA from glycolysis or β-oxidation reacts with bicarbonate
ion in a reaction (Figure 13-18) powered by ATP and catalyzed by acetyl-CoA
carboxylase, forming the three-carbon molecule malonyl-CoA.
The release of insulin triggers a series of steps that result in the activation of
acetyl-CoA carboxylase. Release of insulin indicates high food levels. Both
glucagon and epinephrine inhibit the enzyme, through a series of steps. In
mammals, the enzymes necessary to synthesize palmitic acid from acetyl-
CoA and malonyl-CoA are present in a complex known as fatty acid synthase.
In plants and bacteria, the enzymes are present as separate molecules.
Synthesis proceeds two carbon atoms at a time, which is why all the natural
fatty acids contain an even number of carbon atoms.
Synthesis begins when a molecule of acetyl-CoA links to an acyl carrier pro-
tein, ACP, and a malonyl-CoA does the same with another ACP. The two ACP-
linked molecules then join and release a carbon dioxide molecule, an ACP,
and an acetoacetyl-ACP. Next are three steps that are the reverse of the first
three steps of β-oxidation. First, NADPH reduces the ketone group to an

alcohol. Then dehydration of the alcohol leaves a double bond between the
second and the third carbon atoms. The coenzyme NADPH again serves as a
reducing agent to produce butyryl-ACP. The sequence repeats with butyryl-
ACP replacing the acetyl-ACP. These steps are in Figure 13-19.

The series of synthesis steps continues up to palmitic acid (16 carbon atoms).
The overall reaction is:
8 acetyl-CoA + 7 H+ + 14 NADPH + 7 ATP →palmitic acid + 8 CoA + 
14 NADP+ + 7 ATP + 7 Pi
Once the palmitic acid forms, additional reactions, where necessary, can
lengthen or shorten the chain. These require different enzyme systems.
Partial oxidation of a saturated fatty acid yields an unsaturated fatty acid.
Membrane lipids
Like other molecules, it is necessary to synthesize the membrane lipids from
their constituents. In the previous section, we explained how to synthesize
the fatty acids. These fatty acids need to be activated with acetyl-CoA in
order to produce the appropriate acyl-CoA. The reduction of dihydroxyace-
tone, from glycolysis, yields glycerol 3-phosphate. The glycerol 3-phosphate
combines with the appropriate acyl-CoA molecules to yield a phosphatidate
(Figure 13-20). The phosphitidate then reacts with an activated serine or an
activated choline to form the appropriate phosphoglyceride.
The formation of the spingolipids follows a similar path. In this case, sphingo-
sine replaces glycerol. The synthesis of sphingosine begins with the reaction
of palmitoyl-CoA, with serine in the presence of acid. This reaction yields
Coenzyme A, carbon dioxide, and the precursor of sphingosine. Oxidation of
the precursor yields sphingosine (Figure 13-21).
An acyl-CoA can then add a fatty acid to the amine group to produce 
N-acylsphingosine (ceramide). The reaction of the alcohol on the third carbon
of the ceramide with activated phosphocholine yields sphingomyelin.
The reaction of ceramide with an activated monosaccharide begins the syn-
thesis of the glycolipids. To complete the synthesis, it is necessary to add
additional activated monocaccharides (UDP-glucose being one example).
Cholesterol is another membrane lipid. It helps to control the fluidity of cell
membranes and is also the precursor of the steroid hormones. The entire
synthesis takes place in the liver, where acetyl-CoA molecules are joined.
Thus, the cholesterol molecule is built up two carbon atoms at a time.

Arginine is essential for children, but not for adults. Tyrosine is non-essential
in the presence of adequate quantities of phenylalanine. Glutamate is impor-
tant to the synthesis of five amino acids. Glutamate may form by the reduc-
tion of α-ketoglutaric acid, an intermediate from the Krebs cycle. The process
is shown in Figure 13-22.
In the forward direction, this is a synthesis reaction, whereas the reverse
reaction is an important oxidative deamination from the catabolism of amino
acids. Glutamate, when necessary, serves as an intermediate in the biosyn-
thesis of alanine, aspartate, asparagine, glutamine, proline, and serine. The
transamination in Figure 13-23 illustrates the formation of alanine.
Replacing pyruvate in the preceding reaction with oxaloacetate yields 
aspartate.
It is possible to convert excess phenylalanine to tyrosine by a simple oxida-
tion in the presence of phenylalanine hydroxylase (Figure 13-24).

Methionine serves as the source of sulfur for the synthesis of cysteine. Serine
serves as the base of the rest of the molecule. Serine is the product of a three-
step process beginning with 3-phosphoglycerate. The process starts with the
oxidation by NAD+ of the secondary alcohol group. The ketone thus formed
undergoes transamination with glutamate to form 3-phosphoserine. Finally,
hydrolysis of the phosphate ester yields serine (Figure 13-25).
The formation of proline is a four-step process beginning with glutamate. The
process is shown in Figure 13-26.

n this chapter, we investigate the role of nitrogen in biomolecules.
Nitrogen occurs primarily in the amino acids (proteins) and in nucleic
acids (purines and pyrimidines), many of which have a distinctive and gener-
ally unpleasant aroma, hence our chapter title. A few other molecules, such
as hemoglobin, also contain nitrogen. Humans eliminate nitrogen primarily in
the urea.
Ring in the Nitrogen: Purine
Adenine and guanine are nitrogen bases that employ the purine ring system
(Figure 14-1). The formation of these molecules is essential to the synthesis
of both DNA and RNA. The biosynthesis of the purines generates the mole-
cules in their nucleotide forms instead of the free base form.

Biosynthesis of purine
The synthesis of purine begins with the activation of D-ribose-5'- phosphate
through pyrophosphorylation. In this reaction a pyrophosphate group from
ATP is transferred to C-1 of an α-D-ribose-5'-phosphate. This gives a 5-phospho-
α-D-ribose 1-pyrophosphate (PRPP) and AMP. The reaction is unusual because
it involves the transfer of an intact pyrophosphate group (Figure 14-2). PRPP is
also necessary for the synthesis of pyrimidines. 
Inosine synthesis
PRPP goes through a series of ten steps (Figure 14-3) to become inosine 5'-
phosphate or inosinic acid (IMP). Notice that throughout these ten steps the
D-ribose-5'-phosphate portion of PRPP does not change. The ten enzymes
necessary for these steps are in Table 14-1. Two additional, though different,
steps are necessary to convert IMP to either AMP or GMP.

AMP synthesis
To convert IMP into AMP, it is necessary to transfer an amino group from an
aspartate. This transfer requires two steps, and the energy to add aspartate
to IMP comes from the hydrolysis of a GTP. The process is then completed by
the loss of fumarate. The enzyme adenylosuccinate synthetase catalyzes the
first step, and the enzyme adenylosuccinate lyase catalyzes the second.
Figure 14-4 illustrates the process.
GMP synthesis
The conversion of IMP to GMP begins with the IMP dehydrogenase catalyzed
oxidation to xanthosine 5'-phosphate. The coenzyme for this step is NAD+.
GMP synthetase catalyzes the next step — the amine transfer from glutamate.
The energy for this step is supplied by the hydrolysis of ATP (Figure 14-5).

How much will it cost?
The biosynthesis of both AMP and GMP requires the hydrolysis of several
high-energy bonds. To produce IMP from D-ribose 5-phosphate requires the
hydrolysis of five high-energy bonds (one PPi and five ATP). To convert IMP
to AMP requires the hydrolysis of one more high-energy bond (from GTP).
And to convert IMP to GMP requires the hydrolysis of two high-energy 
bonds — one ATP and one PPi.
Anaerobic organisms, such as the bacteria responsible for tetanus or botu-
lism, must oxidize four glucose molecules at two ATP per glucose to meet the
energy requirement. An aerobic organism, like you, for example, needs to oxi-
dize only one glucose molecule at 36 or 38 ATP per glucose. The preceding
processes require a substantial amount of energy. Sometimes this energy
requirement may be lessened by metabolic processes known as the salvage
pathways. In the salvage pathways, nitrogen bases are recycled instead of
synthesized. The nitrogen bases are then converted to nucleotides.
Pyrimidine Synthesis
The biosynthesis of pyrimidines follows a different path from purine synthe-
sis. In this case, synthesis of the base takes place before attachment to the
ribose. Ring synthesis requires bicarbonate ion, aspartic acid, and ammonia.
Although it is possible to use ammonia directly, it usually comes from the
hydrolysis of the side chain of glutamine.
First step: Carbamoyl phosphate
The initial step is to transfer a phosphate from an ATP to a bicarbonate ion to
form carboxyphosphate, which in turn undergoes an exchange where ammo-
nia replaces the phosphate to form carbamic acid. Whew! — got that? A
second ATP transfers a phosphate to carbamic acid to form carbamoyl 
phosphate. Figure 14-6 summarizes these steps.
The primary enzyme for the process in Figure 14-6 is carbamoyl synthetase.
One region of the enzyme is responsible for the synthesis of carbamic acid,
whereas a second region hydrolyzes ammonia from glutamine. A third region
completes the process, and a channel connects the three regions.
Next step: Orotate
The next step in pyrimidine synthesis is the formation of orotate, which will
be joined to a ribose. It begins with the enzyme aspartate transcarbamoylate,
245
Chapter 14: Smelly Biochemistry: Nitrogen in Biological Systems

which joins aspartate to carbamoyl phosphate with the loss of phosphate.
This forms carbamoylaspartate. Carbamoylaspartate cyclizes to dihydro-
orotate, which is oxidized by NAD+ to orotate (Figure 14-2).

Orotate joins with 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP) to form
orotidylate, with pyrophosphate hydrolysis providing the energy necessary.
The enzyme pyrimidine phosphoribosyltransferase is responsible for this
reaction. The enzyme orotidylate decarboxylase catalyzes the decarboxyla-
tion of orotidylate to uridylate (UMP). Figure 14-8 illustrates these steps.

Last step: Cytidine
The final nucleotide, cytidine, forms from uridinemonophosphate (UMP). The
first step is to change UMP into UTP. UMP kinase transfers a pyrophosphate
from ATP to UMP. Figure 14-9 shows this process.
Back to the Beginning: Catabolism 
Catabolism, remember, is the breaking down of molecules to provide energy.
In many cases, a complete breakdown is not necessary, because the products
from a partial breakdown can be reused when necessary.

Nucleotide catabolism
The breakdown of the nucleotides begins with the removal of a phosphate
group (from C-5). Next, a phosphate attaches to C-1 to give the sugar-1-
phosphate, and the base leaves. In humans and many other species, uric 
acid (Figure 14-10) is the product of further degradation of purines. Other
biochemical species further degrade uric acid into other products.
Amino acid catabolism
Hydrolysis of proteins yields the separate amino acids. It is possible to recy-
cle these amino acids, use them in the synthesis of other amino acids, or pro-
duce energy from them. Through transamination it is possible to transfer an
amino group from any amino acid (other than lysine, proline, or threonine),
and an α-keto acid. The general category of enzymes that catalyzes this reac-
tion is a transaminase, and the general reaction is shown in Figure 14-11.
Nitrogen destined for elimination transfers to α-ketoglutarate to form gluta-
mate. Transamination is important in the biosynthesis of alanine, aspartate,
and glutamate.
Oxidative deamination of glutamate forms α-ketoglutarate (to be recycled),
an ammonium ion (to enter the urea cycle) and, indirectly, 3 ATP. Glutamate
dehydrogenase and either NAD+ or NADP+ are necessary for this.
The deaminated amino acid (α-keto acid) is further broken down. The α-keto
acid may be broken down to pyruvate or some other material the body can

use to form glucose. These acids are called glucogenic. The alternative is to
break down the α-keto acid to acetyl CoA and acetoacetic acid. These acids
are called ketogenic. To further confuse you, some amino acids may be both
glucogenic and ketogenic (see Table 14-2). These are the two possible fates of
the carbon skeleton of the amino acids. The degradation of the amino acid
transforms the carbon skeletons into intermediates in the citric acid cycle or
into materials convertible to glucose.

Glucogenic and Ketogenic Amino Acids
Glucogenic: Alanine, arginine, asparagine, aspartate, ccysteine, glutamate, 
glutamine, glycine, histidine, methionine, proline, serine, threonine, valine
Ketogenic: Leucine
Both: Isoleucine, lysine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan
The general process is cyclic, with the various amino acids entering at differ-
ent points. The basic scheme is shown in Figure 14-12.
Heme catabolism 
The other important nitrogen compound in red-blooded organisms is heme.
This species occurs in both hemoglobin and myoglobin. Hemoglobin is
released as aged red blood cells are destroyed. The globin portion hydrolyzes
to the appropriate amino acids. The iron separates from the heme and is
stored in ferritin. Through a series of steps, bilirubin forms from the heme.
The gall bladder temporarily stores bilirubin until the organism eliminates it.
Process of Elimination: The Urea Cycle 
The catabolism of nitrogen-containing compounds yields recyclable nitrogen
compounds and ammonia. Glutamine serves as temporary storage and trans-
portation of the nitrogen — however, even small amounts of ammonia are
toxic to humans. For this reason, ammonia must be converted to a less toxic
form for elimination. The first step involves the conversion of ammonia, as
the ammonium ion, to carbamoyl phosphate. The enzyme utilized for this
conversion is carbamoyl phosphate synthetase. Figure 14-13 illustrates this
reaction. 
250
Part IV: Bioenergetics and Pathways 

Carbamoyl phosphate enters the urea cycle by joining to ornithine to pro-
duce citrulline, with the enzyme ornithine transcarbamoylase catalyzing this
reaction. The enzyme arginosuccinate synthetase, with energy from the
hydrolysis of ATP, joins aspartate to citrulline to form arginosuccinate.
Arginosuccinase then catalyzes the splitting of arginosuccinate to fumarate

Amino Acids Once Again
The synthesis of proteins requires 20 amino acids. If not readily available,
humans can synthesize ten of these amino acids. These are the non-essential
amino acids. The remaining ten amino acids, the essential amino acids, must
come from the diet. Table 14-3 summarizes these amino acids.

* Not essential in adults
A complete protein supplies all essential amino acids. Not all proteins are
complete — many are incomplete proteins. In order to avoid disorders due 
to amino acid deficiencies, the human diet must contain complete proteins.
Transamination is important in the biosynthesis of alanine, aspartate, and
glutamate. It is easy to convert aspartate to asparagines and glutamate to 
glutamine. The synthesis of proline requires four steps beginning with gluta-
mate. The synthesis of serine begins with the glycolysis intermediate 3-
phosphoglycerate, and after three steps serine forms. It is easy to convert
serine to glycine. If sufficient phenylalanine is available, the catalyzed oxida-
tion converts it to tyrosine. If sufficient methionine is available, the body can
convert some of the excess to cysteine. Arginine comes from the urea cycle,
but infants do not get sufficient quantities from this source.

Part IV: Bioenergetics and Pathways 

Metabolic Disorders
When something is out of whack with an organism’s metabolism, problems
arise that must be treated.
Gout
Gout is the result of overproduction of uric acid, which leads to the precipita-
tion of sodium urate in regions of the body where the temperature is lower
than normal (37°C). These low temperature regions are commonly found in
the joints of the extremities. Sodium urate may also precipitate as kidney
stones. Treatment is partially dietary and partly with drugs. Dietary restric-
tions include limiting the intake of foods high in nucleic acids (meats) and
alcohol, which aggravates the conditions. Doctors often prescribe drugs that
inhibit the enzyme that produces uric acid.
Gout may also be the result of faulty carbohydrate metabolism. A deficiency
in glucose-6 phosphatase forces phosphorylated carbohydrates to form
ribose 5-phosphate instead of glucose. Excess ribose 5-phosphate leads to
excess PRPP, which, in turn, stimulates the synthesis of purines. The excess
purines cause the production of more uric acid.
Lesch-Nyhan syndrome
Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is another example of defective purine catabolism
leading to excess uric acid. Patients with this disorder normally excrete 4–5
times as much uric acid as gout patients do. This is a genetic disease that is a
recessive X-linked trait, the trait is carried by the mother and is passed on to
her son. There is no treatment for this disease at the present time.
Albinism
Albinism, a recessive trait, is an inborn error of tyrosine metabolism. Tyrosine
is the precursor of melanin, the pigment responsible for hair and skin color.
In at least one form of albinism, the problem appears to be due a deficiency
of the enzyme tyrosinase. A variation of albinism involves a temperature-
sensitive form of tyrosinase. The enzyme is only effective at lower than
normal temperatures, as found in the extremities. This form of tyrosinase 
is responsible for the coloration of Siamese cats.

Alkaptonuria
Alkaptonuria is a benign condition that manifests itself as a darkening of the
urine. The condition is the result of a problem in the catabolic breakdown of
phenylalanine and tyrosine. A defective enzyme leads to an accumulation,
and subsequent elimination, of one of the reaction intermediates.
Phenylketonuria
Phenylketonuria, or PKU, is the result of a deficiency in the enzyme phenylala-
nine 4-monooxygenase, which results in a problem in phenylalanine metabo-
lism. The consequence is an accumulation of phenylalanine in the blood.
High levels of phenylalanine enhance transamination to form abnormally high
levels of phenylpyruvate. High levels of phenylpyruvate damage the brains of
infants with the condition.
The high levels of phenylalanine lead to competitive inhibition of the enzymes
responsible for melanin production from tyrosine. Because little tyrosine con-
verts to melanin, afflicted infants have light blonde hair and fair skin (similar
to albinism).
Early diagnosis in infants is important to prevent brain damage. One test for
PKU is to add FeCl3 to the patient’s urine. Phenylpyruvate reacts with iron
ions to produce a green color. Another test is to assay for phenylalanine 4-
monooxygenase activity. Treatment consists of maintaining a diet low in
phenylalanine until at least the age of three.

n 1958, Francis Crick postulated what became the “central dogma of mole-
cular biology.” In this postulate, he, and later others, reasoned that DNA
was the central source of genetic information and that it passed on some of
this information to form RNA, which, in turn, passed this information on to
form proteins. This central dogma is an extension of the one-gene one-protein
hypothesis. To achieve this, the DNA must be able to pass on its information
both to later generations (replication), and to RNA (transcription). RNA must
finish the series by forming the appropriate proteins (translation).
Some RNA, especially some viral RNA, can undergo replication and even
reverse-transcription — thus, RNA can produce both RNA and DNA. Genetic
researchers initially thought this was in conflict with the central dogma; but
Crick reasoned that RNA creating DNA was an extension of this postulate. 
Many of the viruses capable of reverse-transcription are cancer causing.
The primary structure of DNA consists of two polynucleotide strands held
together by hydrogen bonds. Adenine forms hydrogen bonds to thymine, and
cytosine forms hydrogen bonds to guanine (Figure 15-1). The sequence of
nitrogen bases contains the genetic information. The DNA molecules wrap
around a protein called a histone — the combination of eight histones with the
associated DNA is a nucleosome. (We talk more about histones in Chapter 16.)

A gene is a portion of a DNA molecule that carries specific information. The
portion of the gene coding for that specific information is called an exon.
The portion of a gene that does not code for specific information is an intron.
Let’s Do It Again: Replication
Replication is the process that produces new DNA molecules. One DNA mole-
cule produce two DNA molecules in a process where the DNA must unwind
and open — kind of like a zipper. New nucleotides bind to the backbone of
each strand of the opened DNA by forming hydrogen bonds to the nucleotides
(the zipper’s “teeth”) that are already present. The process proceeds along
the opening DNA strand until each half of the original DNA has a complemen-
tary strand hydrogen bonded to it. The result is two DNA double helices each
with half old DNA, and half new. It doesn’t sound like much fun, but it works
for DNA. Replication is illustrated in Figure 15-2.
The specific hydrogen bonding forces the new strands to contain a
nucleotide sequence that is complementary to the nucleotide sequence in
the old strand. Therefore, it can create an exact duplicate of the original DNA.
This description of replication is a simplification. It barely scratches the sur-
face of this complicated process, but it should give you enough background
information in order to understand what comes next.
The first step in understanding replication was the discovery of DNA poly-
merase from Escherichia coli. Subsequent studies showed that this enzyme
needed a DNA template and all four deoxyriboside triphosphates (dATP,
dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP). In addition, a short section of RNA called a primer
is also needed. The enzyme prefers a single DNA strand for the template in
order to produce a complementary strand.

During replication, simultaneous duplication of the two strands of DNA occurs.
Because the two strands of DNA are anti-parallel, the mode of synthesis is dif-
ferent for each strand, but the overall process is the same: moving from one
end to the other. For one strand the synthesis is from 5' →3'. On the other
strand it appears to be from 3' →5', but in actuality it is also 5' →3'. There is
a complication on the 3' →5' strand (which we discuss later in this section).
See Figure 15-3. 
The initiation of replication begins at a particular site, and, once initiated, a
series of fragments form discontinuously along one strand and continuously
along the other strand. These discontinuous fragments, known as Okazaki
fragments, contain from 1,000 to 2,000 nucleotides. The synthesis of the frag-
ments is always in the 5' →3' direction. See Figure 15-4. Note that Figures 15-3
and 15-4 appear to be different at first glance. Figure 15-3 represents a simpli-
fied view of the overall process, whereas Figure 15-4 illustrates in more detail
how this overall process occurs.

Chapter 15: Photocopying DNA

Researchers unexpected found that RNA synthesis is a prerequisite for the
replication of DNA. Initially, an RNA primer, typically 20 to 30 nucleotides in
length, forms on a single DNA strand. Once formed, deoxyribonucleotide
nucleotides add to the 3' terminus. Later, it is necessary to remove the
RNA primer and attach the appropriate DNA fragment to produce the com-
pleted DNA.

At least a portion of the double-stranded DNA must be separated before repli-
cation can occur, and the separated portions can serve as templates.
Enzymes known as helicases are responsible for this separation. The energy
needed comes from the hydrolysis of ATP. The mechanism of separation is
not well understood and is still under investigation. Apparently, the helicase
binds more strongly to one strand of the DNA than the other so that the
enzyme squeezes in and pushes the other strand away. ATP hydrolysis pro-
vides the energy necessary to cause the enzyme to move along the one
strand nucleotide by nucleotide. This results in regions of the DNA opening
like the afore-mentioned zipper.
DNA polymerases
DNA polymerases are the enzymes responsible for joining the nucleotide
triphosphate fragments to produce a strand of DNA, acting as the bricklayers
and carpenters in its construction. This process will only occur in the pres-
ence of a DNA template (parent DNA). Before the enzyme can connect a
nucleotide, the nucleotide must bind to the appropriate site on the template.
There may be more than one DNA polymerase present in a cell. For example,
in E. coli three different enzymes perform this task. These enzymes may also
act as exonucleases. An exonuclease has the opposite function as a poly-
merase; that is, it removes nucleotides from the DNA strand.
The addition of the nucleotides is always to the 3' end of a polynucleotide
chain. DNA polymerases cannot start building a nucleotide from scratch —
there must be a polynucleotide already present. In contrast, RNA polymerase
can begin from scratch. RNA polymerase generates the RNA primer, using
ribonucleotides, at the beginning of replication. DNA polymerase then takes
over the task and adds deoxynucleotides to the RNA primer. The polymeriza-
tion requires the presence of two metal ions to enable the joining of the
nucleotide to the polynucleotide.
Replication of DNA needs to be error free to ensure proper transmission of
genetic information, and DNA polymerases are extremely effective in reduc-
ing errors. The enzyme binds tightly to the template and to the incoming
nucleotide. This nucleotide is initially bound to the template through hydro-
gen bonding. If the wrong nucleotide is present, the subsequent binding to
the polymerase is ineffective, and the nucleotide is “rejected.” In addition to
this checking, DNA polymerase also proofreads the preceding nucleotide 
to make sure it is correct. If the wrong nucleotide is present, it does not fit
properly, making it necessary to remove the erroneous nucleotide from the
polynucleotide so that the correct nucleotide may enter. The exonuclease
portion of the polymerases performs this function. The polymerase proof-
reads the polynucleotide chain as polymerization proceeds. Proofreading is
in the reverse direction (3' →5'). There must be a nucleotide already in place
before the polymerase can proofread. (We hope that our proofreader is as
good as the DNA polymerases.)
263
Chapter 15: Photocopying DNA

The current model of DNA replication
In vitro studies show that in E. coli, replication begins when a protein binds a
region of the DNA containing four specific binding sites. This is the origin of
replication site. Once this protein binds, a helicase enzyme attacks the DNA
and begins to unwind and separate the two strands. A third protein enters
and holds the DNA strands open so that replication can continue. This third
protein is the single-strand binding protein. The partially opened DNA and
associated proteins are called the prepriming complex (Figure 15-5).
It is necessary to expose the DNA templates in this manner. A DNA strand may
have more than one origin of replication site — this allows replication to occur
in many places at one time. Simultaneous replication allows the cell to repli-
cate the entire strand in less time.
Replication cannot continue until the exposed template is primed. A type of
RNA polymerase known as primase binds to the prepriming complex in a
region known as the primosome. Primase synthesizes a short RNA segment 
of about five nucleotides. Primase is capable of performing this function
because its proofreading ability is not as efficient as that of DNA polymerase.
For this reason, a nucleotide doesn’t need to already be present to be
checked. Because the primer consists of ribonucleotides instead of deoxyri-
bonucleotides, it is temporary and will be detected and removed later. Once
removed, the appropriate deoxyribonucleotides join to complete the DNA
strand (Figure 15-6).

Part V: Genetics: Why We Are What We Are 

Although both strands of DNA serve as templates, the replication process dif-
fers on each strand. The point where the strands split and replication occurs
is the replication fork. Because the two strands are anti-parallel, and DNA
polymerase only works in the 5' →3' direction, direct replication only works
on one strand — called the leading strand. The other strand is the lagging
strand.
As the DNA strands separate, eventually there is enough room to begin syn-
thesis in the reverse direction on the lagging strand. (The reverse direction
on the anti-parallel lagging strand is still 5' →3'.) Replication on the lagging
strand is discontinuous, and fragments of about 1,000 nucleotides form,
called, as we have already noted, Okazaki fragments. DNA ligase then joins
the fragments to produce a continuous strand.
DNA polymerase III holoenzyme (complete enzyme) simultaneously produces
DNA on both the leading and lagging strands, though the mechanisms on the
two strands are different. On the leading strand the process is continuous,
whereas on the lagging strand it is discontinuous and more complex. To carry
out the polymerization on the lagging strand, this strand loops around so
that polymerization in the 5' →3' direction can take place. After about 1,000
nucleotides — an Okazaki fragment — the polymerase releases the loop and
begins a new loop and fragment. Each Okazaki fragment has a RNA primer.
DNA polymerase I synthesizes DNA in the gaps between the fragments and
removes the primer section. DNA ligase then joins the fragments (Figure 15-7).

Chapter 15: Photocopying DNA

The ends of the DNA strands require a different procedure than does the
majority of the strand, and this procedure is especially important on the lag-
ging strand. If care were not taken, each replication cycle would result in a
shorter DNA strand, eventually leading to the loss of important genetic mate-
rial. To resolve this problem the ends of the DNA strands contain telomeres.
Telomeres are DNA segments containing hundreds of repeating units. In
humans, the repeating units are the hexanucleotide AGGGTT. The enzyme
telomerase, in humans, detects the primer sequence GGTT and repeatedly
attaches the hexanucleotide units, completing the DNA strand.
Mechanisms of DNA repair
All cells have a variety of DNA repair mechanisms, which are necessary to
repair defective DNA and ensure retention of genetic information. Damage to
DNA may occur during replication or by the action of radiation or chemicals.
There is a rare error known as xeroderma pigmentosum, which impairs these
repair mechanisms. Individuals suffering from it are extremely susceptible to
cancers, especially skin cancers. Eventually the skin cancers metastasize,
leading to death. The three general types of repair mechanisms are
 Direct repair
 Base-excision repair
 Nucleotide-excision repair
One example of damage needing repair is the formation of a thymine dimer
(Figure 15-8) by ultraviolet (UV) light. The thymine dimer is an example of a

pyrimidine dimer, and its presence causes distortion of the DNA in the region.
Other problems include base mismatches and missing or additional bases.
Direct repair
Here, the correction of the problem occurs in place. The photoreactivating
enzyme, DNA photolyase, binds to the cyclobutane ring present in a thymine
dimer, using light energy to cleave this dimer into the original bases. 
Base-excision repair
In base-excision repair, the correction of the problem involves removal and
replacement of the base. This is necessary whenever a modified base is pre-
sent. There are various causes of modified bases, such as radiation or certain
chemicals. The presence of a modified base normally results in a recogniz-
able distortion in the DNA molecule. An enzyme, behaving as a glycosylase,
cleaves the glycosidic bond to release the base from the deoxyribose. The
result is an AP site (AP meaning apurinic or apyrimidinic). With apurinic, the
purine base is absent, in apyrimidinic the pyrimidine base is absent. An AP
endonuclease recognizes this site and cuts the DNA backbone adjacent to 
the site. Next, a deoxyribose phosphodiesterase completes the removal of the
remaining deoxyribose phosphate. DNA polymerase I then inserts a replace-
ment nucleotide to match the nucleotide in the complementary DNA strand.
Finally, DNA ligase connects the units to yield the repaired strand — kind of
like an electrician cutting out a bad circuit and splicing a good one in its place.
Nucleotide-excision repair
In nucleotide-excision repair, the correction of the problem involves the
removal of a segment of DNA around the problem followed by its replace-
ment. When this mechanism occurs, a DNA strand on both sides of the error
is cut from the DNA strand. Typically, an exonuclease removes a 12-nucleotide
section. DNA polymerase I then synthesizes a replacement segment of the
strand. DNA ligase then finishes the repair.

Mutation: The good, the bad, and the ugly
Several types of mutations are known. DNA repair mechanisms try to prevent
new mutations — however, such mechanisms are not always effective. Known
mutations include the substitution of one base pair for another, the insertion
of one or more base pairs, and the deletion of one or more base pairs.
Changes, especially subtle ones, may occur during or after replication.
The substitution of one base for another is a common mutation. There are
two types of substitutions. The replacement may be of a purine by the other
purine (Figure 15-9) or the replacement of a pyrimidine by the other pyrimi-
dine (Figure 15-10). This type of error is a transition. The other type of substi-
tution is the replacement of a purine for a pyrimidine or vice versa. This
latter type is a transversion.

Any uncorrected discrepancy in the genetic code will become “normal” in all
future generations. The new genetic code is a mutation. The change in the
base sequence may or may not affect the amino acid for which the codon
codes. For example, changing from GTT (coding for leucine) to GTG (also
coding for leucine) results in no change. However, if the change results in
coding for a different amino acid, the resultant protein will function differ-
ently. If the new protein exhibits improved function, the organism benefits
from the change. But if the new protein exhibits impaired function — the
more likely situation — the organism suffers from the change. Problems from
impaired function are genetic diseases. Table 15-1 lists some of these.

Restriction enzymes
Although not directly related to replication, restriction enzymes are impor-
tant tools in genetic research. Restriction enzymes, or restriction nucleases, are
capable of cutting DNA into fragments. These were first found in prokaryote
cells like E. coli where these enzymes locate and destroy invading DNA, such
as that of a bacteriophage, but leave the cell’s own DNA alone. Recent research
focuses on the fact that it is possible to manipulate these fragments so that
DNA ligases can join the fragments into new DNA. Restriction enzymes are
important in vitro biochemical tools that act as very accurate molecular
scalpels. Cleavage may leave both DNA strands of equal length or one strand
may be longer than the other (a staggered cut).
More than 100 restriction enzymes have been identified and are available for
research. These enzymes recognize specific regions in the DNA and cleave
DNA molecules into specific fragments. Because these fragments are smaller
than the parent DNA is, they are easier to manipulate and analyze. Testing a
strand of DNA with a series of restriction enzymes can provide a fingerprint
of cleaved fragments. In fact, you can map the structure of DNA.
Many times in reading descriptions of genetic determination and modifica-
tion, you will run across the terms in vivo and in vitro. In vivo means in the
cell, whereas in vitro means in a test tube.
Mendel Rolling Over: Recombinant DNA
Recombinant DNA technology allows the synthesis of DNA strands that con-
tain one or more genes not originally present. The addition of new genes
enables an organism to produce new biochemicals. For example, E. coli has
been engineered to produce human insulin. Recombinant DNA technology
also allows biochemists to add a gene to compensate for a defective gene.
Restriction enzymes are capable of removing DNA fragments of interest. It is
then necessary to join one of these fragments to another DNA strand for
replication. The DNA to which the fragment of interest is attached is the
vector. Common vectors include plasmids. A plasmid is a naturally occurring
DNA circle. The first step in adding the fragment is to create a staggered cut
in the DNA of the vector. The longer end of the staggered cut is a “sticky” or
cohesive end. It is possible to attach any DNA fragment to the sticky end if it
has the complementary DNA sequence. The complementary sticky end will
be present if the same restriction enzyme was used to excise the fragment 
of interest. DNA ligase completes the joining of the fragment to the vector
(Figure 15-11).
270
Part V: Genetics: Why We Are What We Are 

It is possible to bond a DNA linker to a DNA molecule to make it susceptible
to a particular restriction enzyme. By this method, the cohesive ends charac-
teristic of any restriction enzyme may be added to almost any DNA molecule.
The completed DNA can undergo replication.
Plasmids are, to a certain extent, accessory chromosomes. They can repli-
cate independently of the host chromosomes. Thus, there may be multiple
copies of a particular plasmid within a cell. This replication, in general,
makes plasmids more useful as vectors than host chromosomes. Thus far,
these plasmids have only been shown to be relevant in bacterial organisms. 
The addition of “new” genes to an organism produces an organism that may
be considered a new species. There is somewhat of a risk that these organ-
isms could infect humans and lead to a new disease for which there is no
known treatment. To minimize potential risks posed by these organisms,
researchers either use enfeebled (weakened) organisms or ones that do not
infect humans.
Patterns: Determining DNA Sequences
Restriction enzymes are a major tool in the determination of the base sequence
in DNA. The cleaved DNA fragments are significantly smaller than the parent
DNA is, making manipulation and analysis significantly easier. To separate the
fragments after cleavage, gel electrophoresis is often used.
Gel electrophoresis is a biochemical technique used to separate and purify
proteins and nucleic acids that differ in charge, size, or confirmation. The
sample is placed into wells within a gel — a polymer that is specifically for-
mulated for the type of analysis. This gel is in the shape of a thin slab. When
separating proteins or small nucleic acids (DNA, RNA, and so on) cross-linked
polyacrylamide is used. For separating larger nucleic acids, agarose, an
extract from seaweed, is used. These gels have the consistency of Jell-O, 
but probably don’t taste nearly as good.

Chapter 15: Photocopying DNA

The gel is immersed in a buffer solution, and an electrical current is applied
to the ends of the gel. The charged species within the sample migrate toward
one or the other of the electrodes. Proteins may have either a positive or a
negative charge, but, at the proper pH, nucleic acids have only a negative
charge. The positively charged species move toward the negatively charged
end of the gel, and the negatively charged species move toward the positively
charged end. Normally a buffer adjusts the pH so that all the species of inter-
est have either a positive or negative charge (Figure 15-12).
Different molecules move at different speeds through the gel. When the
smaller, faster molecules have about reached the end of it, the process is
stopped, and the molecules are stained to make them visible. Sometimes,
agents are added to cause the molecules to fluoresce (glow) under UV light.
Then a photograph of the gel may be taken as it is exposed to the UV light.
When several samples, including a known sample, are run side by side, the
molecular weight of a sample component may be determined. This is one
step in the identification of unknown components.
The separation of DNA fragments by gel electrophoresis readily distinguishes
even minor differences between the fragments. Different gels are useful in
separating large fragments than are useful in the separation of small fragments.
In some gels, it is possible to distinguish between fragments differing by one
base in several hundred. Modification of the electrophoresis method provides
further separation. Each type of DNA gives a different pattern, making it possi-
ble to distinguish between two different samples. Two samples giving identical
patterns must be from the same source or from identical twins.

Part V: Genetics: Why We Are What We Are 

In the analysis and manipulation of genetic material, it is advantageous to be
able to identify whether a certain sequence of nucleotides is present. The
general method for finding a particular  sequence of nucleotides in DNA was
developed by Edwin Southern. It is called Southern blotting. This method uses
radioactive 32P as a label that is easily detectible. This radioisotope is incor-
porated into the phosphate in some of the nucleotides. Determination of a
particular nucleotide sequence in RNA is achieved through Northern blotting,
and protein identification through Western blotting. (The names Northern and
Western do not refer to persons with that name, but are by analogy to
Southern. We don’t know what happened to Eastern.) Alternatively, Southern,
Northern, and Western blotting are DNA, RNA, and protein blots, respectively.
Determining the base sequence
Since the first isolation of DNA, a number of methods have been developed 
to determine the base sequence. In general, the Sanger dideoxy method has
replaced all others. It employs the controlled termination of replication with
modified nucleotides containing dideoxyribose in place of deoxyribose.
DNA fragments produced by employing restriction enzymes are denatured 
to give single-stranded DNA. (Denaturing typically involves heating a DNA-
containing solution to 96°C for a few seconds.) Four samples of this DNA are
treated separately to produce double-stranded DNA through replication, with
each sample containing a small quantity of a different dideoxy nucleotide.
The dideoxy nucleotide contains dideoxyribose (Figure 15-13). The absence
of an additional oxygen atom in dideoxyribose means that there is no 3'
hydroxyl group available to continue replication. Thus, the incorporation of 
a dideoxynucleotide terminates the DNA chain. 
One of the four samples will contain a small quantity of the dideoxy analog of
the nucleotide dGTP. This “defective” unit enters the new DNA strand as the
complement to a cytosine base in the original fragment. Separation of the
new material from the original strand material gives a set of DNA fragments 
of varying length. These fragments are then separated by electrophoresis
according to length (size). The length of each of these fragments locates the
position of each C in the original strand. The other three samples give the
positions of all A, T, and G bases in the original strand.
Fluorescence tagging is a useful modification to this method. Each of the
dideoxy nucleotides has a different fluorescent tag attached. After attaching
the tags, it is possible to conduct all four experiments in one container.
Separating the fragments by electrophoresis and examining the tags gives a
colored pattern showing all the bases in sequence. This method works for
fragments of up to 500 bases.
273
Chapter 15: Photocopying DNA

To do the studies described, you need a sufficient amount of genetic material.
Lack of sufficient quantities of sample has been a problem, especially with
forensic evidence. Therefore, ways of quickly duplicating sufficient quantities
of identical DNA fragments or producing a number of DNA strands from a
very small sample were developed. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR), is a
useful method to amplify specific DNA sequences. It is an in vitro procedure
where it is necessary to know the base sequences, the flanking sequences,
adjacent to a particular target sequence. However, it is not necessary to know
the base sequence in the target region. Denaturation of a DNA sample pro-
vides two separate strands. Two primers are added to the mixture and one
primer will attach to the flanking sequence of each strand. DNA polymerase
begins replication starting at each of these primers. Repeating these steps
quickly generates a large quantity of DNA. After 30 or so cycles, a billion-fold
amplification occurs. Thirty cycles take less than one hour.
The butler did it: Forensic applications
Scientists can identify a species by the isolation and examination of the DNA
sequences unique to that species. For example, DNA analysis is useful in the
identification of organisms, such as bacteria, that may be polluting our water,
food, and other samples. It has been used to establish pedigrees for livestock

breeds as well as identify endangered species in the prosecution of poachers.
However, the application that has received the most publicity is in the area of
forensics.
Because an individual’s DNA comes from both the mother and father, it is
unique to that individual (except in the case of identical twins). Even broth-
ers and sisters, including fraternal twins, with the same parents show some
variation in their DNA. This fact makes DNA analysis very valuable in foren-
sics investigations (as anyone who ever watched an episode of CSI can
attest).
In order to identify an individual, forensic investigators examine 13 regions
(markers) of the DNA sample that vary significantly from individual to indi-
vidual. There is a very small chance that two individuals might have the same
DNA pattern at these 13 regions, but it is only about one chance in a billion.
The investigation of additional markers can improve the discriminating 
ability of the procedure. Investigators then combine the results into a DNA
profile — also known as a DNA fingerprint — of the individual.
You can isolate DNA samples from blood, hair, bone, fingernails, teeth, and
any type of bodily fluid. In a typical crime scene analysis, samples are taken
from the evidence and suspects; the DNA is extracted and then analyzed for
the specific markers. A match of a single marker does not prove that an indi-
vidual was at the crime scene, but the matching of four or five markers indi-
cates a very high probability that the individual was present. PCR may be
necessary if the sample is very small (see preceding section).
Methods of analysis
Several techniques are used in DNA analysis. The three most common are
RFLP, PCR, and STR. In RFLP (Restriction fragment length polymorphism), the
DNA sample is digested with a specific enzyme, a restriction endonuclease.
This enzyme cuts DNA at a specific sequence pattern. The presence or absence
of these sites in a DNA sample leads to variable lengths of DNA fragments. Gel
electrophoresis then separates these fragments.
RFLP was one of the original forensic DNA analysis techniques. However, it
requires relatively large amounts of DNA and samples contaminated with dirt
and mold are difficult to analyze with RFLP. It has been somewhat replaced
with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) enhancement, followed by STR analysis.
PCR (discussed in the earlier section “Determining the base sequence”) is a
useful technique that reduces the sample size requirement of RFLP — in
essence it is a DNA amplifier. PCR quickly makes millions of exact copies of
the DNA sample. Using PCR, DNA analysis can be done on a sample as small
as a few cells and on samples that are extensively degraded. After PCR treat-
ment, it is possible to analyze the sample with RFLP or STR.
275
Chapter 15: Photocopying DNA

In STR (Short tandem repeat) analysis, the DNA sample is quickly examined
for 13 specific regions. The FBI uses this standard STR profile in its CODIS
(Combined DNA Index System) program, which links national, state, and local
databases of DNA profiles from felons, missing persons, and unsolved crime
scenes. CODIS has an index of more than 3 million DNA profiles.
Paternity testing 
Along with crime scene analysis, paternity testing is one of the most widely
used applications of DNA testing. The procedure begins with the collection of
DNA samples from the mother, child, and alleged father(s). The DNA profiles
of the child and mother are first determined. The markers not inherited from
the mother must have come from the biological father. The alleged father’s
DNA profile is then compared to the child. If the man’s DNA profile contains
markers common to the child but not the mother, then the probability that he
is the biological father is great. Figure 15-14 indicates that Alleged Father 2 is
more likely to be the biological father than Alleged Father 1.
Genetic Diseases and Other 
DNA Testing Applications
DNA testing always seems to find new ways of being useful. It has been used
for a number of years, for example, in determining the gender of athletes. In
addition to gender testing, the NFL used a strand of synthetic DNA to mark all
the Super Bowl XXXIV footballs as a way to combat fraud associated with
sports memorabilia. In a different situation, a section of DNA was added 
to the ink used to imprint all official goods marketed at the 2000 Summer
Olympics Games. This same technology is used to tag original artwork, in
addition to sports souvenirs.

Genetic diseases are the result of an abnormal pattern in the DNA of an indi-
vidual. These diseases are inherited, though some individuals are only carri-
ers and not sufferers. Recently quite a bit of research has been done in
determining the genetic pattern that is causing the disease, and ways to
detect the probability of passing on the disease to offspring. However, meth-
ods of treatment for most all of these disease are limited. It is the dream of
researchers to find the means of correcting these genetic diseases through
genetic modifications. Researchers have investigated several of these genetic
diseases in detail. In this section we briefly examine a few of the more well-
known genetic diseases.
Sickle cell anemia
Sickle cell anemia is an inherited genetic disease of the blood’s hemoglobin, a
component of red blood cells. Sickle cell anemia is the result of the change of
a single amino acid in the protein sequence of hemoglobin. This change
involves the substitution of valine (non-polar) for glutamic acid (polar). The
condition affects millions of individuals throughout the world, especially
those whose ancestors came from Africa, South America, Cuba, Saudi Arabia,
and a few other countries. In the United States, it affects about 72,000 people.
Sickle cell happens in about 1 in 500 African American births and about 1 in
1,200 Hispanic American births. 
Hemoglobin is responsible for carrying oxygen from the lungs to the cells. In
an individual with sickle cell anemia, the defective hemoglobin molecules
clump together, causing the red blood cells to assume a sickle shape, hence
the name. These abnormal cells have trouble squeezing through small blood
vessels, causing oxygen depletion in organs and extremities along with
episodes of pain. These sickle cells also have a much shorter lifetime in the
body, leaving the individual with chronic anemia. Many states now test new-
borns for sickle cell disease.
Hemochromatosis
Hemochromatosis, one of the most common genetic diseases in the United
States, is an inherited disease that causes the body to absorb and store far
too much iron. This excess iron is stored in organs, such as the liver, pan-
creas, and skin (yes, the skin is considered an organ!). It is due to a mutation
in the HFE gene, the gene that regulates the absorption of iron from food. 
If this defective gene is inherited from both parents, then the person will
develop hemochromatosis. If the individual inherits the mutated gene from
only one parent, the person will be a carrier but will not necessarily develop
the disease. About 5 Caucasian people in 1,000 carry both mutated genes, and
1 in 10 is a carrier. Genetic testing can detect it about 90 percent of the time.
277
Chapter 15: Photocopying DNA

Cystic fibrosis
Cystic fibrosis is a chronic and normally fatal genetic disease affecting the
body’s mucus glands. It targets the digestive and respiratory systems. About
55,000 individuals worldwide have cystic fibrosis. Most of these individuals
are Caucasians who have ancestors who came from northern Europe. For the
disease to appear it is necessary to inherit the mutated gene responsible for
cystic fibrosis from both parents. Estimates are that 1 in 20 Americans carry
the abnormal gene. Most of these individuals are not aware that they are car-
riers. Genetic testing is only about 80 percent accurate.
Hemophilia
Hemophilia is a genetic disorder caused by the lack of the blood-clotting
factor stemming from a defective gene on the X chromosome. Females have
two X chromosomes, so if there is a defective gene on one, there is little
chance that the other one is also defective. However, she will be a carrier.
Males, however, only have one X chromosome, so if it is defective, then the
individual will develop hemophilia. If a woman is a carrier, she will have a 50
percent chance that her sons will have hemophilia and a 50 percent chance
that her daughters will be carriers. Daughters of a hemophilic male will be
carriers. Genetic testing can detect the presence of the abnormal gene.
Tay-Sachs
Tay-Sachs is an inherited disease in which a fatty-acid derivative, a lipid called
ganglioside, accumulates in the brain — the result of a mutation of a specific
gene. Although found primarily in the Jewish population, some French
Canadians and Louisiana Cajuns also carry the abnormal gene. The symp-
toms most commonly appear in infants. Death normally occurs before the
age of five. Although Tay-Sachs is a very rare disease, it was one of the first
genetic diseases for which extensive and inexpensive genetic screening was
developed. Screening tests were developed in the 1970s, and Israel offered
free genetic screening and counseling. Because of this aggressive testing and
counseling, the disease has been almost totally eradicated from Jewish fami-
lies worldwide.

Ethics of genetic modification and testing
The emerging field of bioengineering has raised
many ethical questions. One has only to listen to
the debates over stem-cell research, gender
selection of children, genetic modification to
enhance certain traits such as athletic ability, and
so on. Public policy decisions related to cost are
also being debated, as genetic modification and
screening are generally expensive. Is it to be
available to only those who can pay, or should
there be equal access? Many gray areas con-
cerning genetic modification exist in the field of
patent law. There are many questions and con-
cerns but no quick answers.
Although the success in eradicating Tay-Sachs is
directly related to genetic testing, such testing is
not without its ethical questions. The major con-
cern is one of privacy. DNA samples and profiles
can be used to determine parentage and suscep-
tibility to certain genetic diseases. Many people
fear that the government, insurance companies,
employers, banks, schools, and other organiza-
tions could use such information for genetic dis-
crimination. In fact, in the United Kingdom, a man
was denied treatment for hemochromatosis
because his insurance company claimed it was a
preexisting condition. Individuals applying for life
insurance have reported other cases of genetic
discrimination. Who gets to request the genetic
screening and who has access to the results?
These are just a few of the questions we will be
debating for many years to come.

ells utilize a number of types of ribonucleic acid — RNA.
Messenger RNA (mRNA), a form that is not very stable, carries information
from the cell nucleus (DNA) into the cell and must migrate to the ribosomes.
Messenger RNA carries the actual genetic information necessary for the syn-
thesis of a specific protein; however, the other forms of RNA are necessary to
complete the process.
Transfer RNA (tRNA) transfers amino acids to the ribosomes for protein syn-
thesis. This is a relatively small form of ribonucleic acid, typically containing
from 73 to 93 nucleotides.
The relatively large ribosomal RNA (rRNA) resides in the ribosomes and has
a direct influence on the synthesis of proteins. This form of RNA has protein
components. There are three types of rRNA (called 23S, 16S, and 5S), and all
three must be present in each ribosome.
Finally, small nuclear RNA (snRNA) serves a number of ancillary functions. 
In this chapter we concentrate upon the synthesis of RNA, which is called
transcription.
Protein synthesis begins with transcription, the process whereby DNA produces
mRNA. First, a portion (a gene) of a DNA double helix opens. Nucleotides can
then bind to the exposed DNA nucleotides through a process similar to replica-
tion. However, this process differs from replication in that only a portion of the

DNA opens, and the entering nucleotides contain uracil in place of thymine.
One gene yields one mRNA, which, in turn, may lead to the synthesis of one 
or more proteins.
The enzyme RNA polymerase joins the nucleotides to produce RNA in a
process that occurs within the cell nucleus. The process begins as an initia-
tion signal toward the 5' end of RNA and goes toward a termination sequence
nearer the 3' end. 
RNA Polymerase Requirements
Three requirements are needed for RNA polymerase to operate. It requires
activated precursors of each of the four ribonucleoside triphosphates (ATP,
CTP, GTP, and UTP) from which to produce the new RNA. (See Figure 16-1.) A
divalent metal ion, either magnesium or manganese, is necessary. Finally, a
template must be present. Single-stranded DNA will work; however, the pre-
ferred template is double-stranded DNA. However, the DNA strands must
open (separate) in order to allow the RNA polymerase access. 
There are many similarities between replication and transcription. In both
processes, the direction of synthesis is 5' →3'. Elongation occurs as the 3'-OH
group of the chain attacks the innermost phosphate of the entering nucleo-
side triphosphate. This is called a nucleophilic attack. The hydrolysis of
pyrophosphate provides the impetus to drive the process forward. However,
there are differences. Unlike its DNA counterpart, RNA polymerase is not
capable of “reviewing” its work and then eliminating a mismatched
nucleotide. RNA polymerase does not require a primer.

Part V: Genetics: Why We Are What We Are 

In simple organisms, such as E. coli, one type of RNA polymerase synthesizes
all forms of RNA. In more advanced organisms, like human beings, there are
different types of RNA polymerase. Usually at least three different types 
are present in mammalian cells.
Making RNA: The Basics
The region of a DNA molecule that codes for a protein is a structural gene.
Other regions are present to regulate the activity of this gene. (We examine
these regulatory regions later in this chapter.) To begin transcription, it is
necessary for RNA polymerase to detect one particular gene present in a long
DNA strand. Detection begins with the enzyme locating a region on the DNA
strand known as a promoter site, which is “upstream” from the actual gene.
(Upstream means on the 5' side.) RNA polymerase tightly binds to the pro-
moter site, and once in place, transcription can begin.
In prokaryotic cells the promoter sites are centered at –10 (the Pribnow box)
and in the –35 region. The Pribnow box has the consensus sequence TATAAT
centered at –10. The other site has the consensus sequence TTGACA. (Not all
organisms have the same consensus sequence.) In eukaryotic cells a promoter
is centered at about –25 (the TATA box or Hogness box), and sometimes cen-
tered near –75 (the CAAT box). The consensus sequence in the Hogness box is
TATAAA. The CAAT box has the sequence GGXCAATCT. In addition, eukaryotic
genes may have enhancer sequences up to several thousand bases away from
the start site and on either side (Figure 16-2).
The position of sequences along the DNA chain begins at the beginning of 
a gene. This position is 0. The first nucleotide of the gene is +1. Counting
upstream (towards the 5' terminus) is negative. Thus, ten nucleotides before
the beginning of the gene would be –10.

Chapter 16: Transcribe This! RNA Transcription

Transcription proceeds as an RNA polymerase moves along the DNA strand.
Eventually, the enzyme encounters a termination signal. In prokaryotic cells,
there are two termination signals. The first is a base-paired hairpin, which
consists of a self-complementary sequence rich in C and G followed by a
sequence of several instances of U. After the sequence forms, the new RNA
detaches from the template. The other method uses a rho protein.
The termination in eukaryotic cells is not very well understood. In eukaryotic
cell, mRNA undergoes further modification after transcription. A “cap” is
attached to the 5' end of the RNA, and a poly(A) tail goes onto the other end.
These modifications increase the lifetime of mRNA.
The stages in RNA synthesis are initiation, elongation, and termination. To
accomplish these tasks, RNA polymerase must perform a series of functions.
The enzyme must travel along a DNA strand until it encounters a promoter
site. As it “sticks” to the promoter site it unwinds a short segment of the DNA
double helix and separates the strands to reach the template. Then the
appropriate ribonucleoside triphosphate enters, and hydrolysis of the phos-
phate occurs in order to supply the needed energy. Each ribonucleoside
triphosphate is brought in as the RNA polymerase moves along the DNA
strand. (The DNA unwinds as the enzyme passes, and rewinds after the
enzymes has passed.) This continues until the RNA polymerase finds a termi-
nation signal. The enzyme also must interact with transcription factors or
trans-acting factors — proteins that act as activators or repressors — to 
regulate the rate of transcription initiation.
The best understood operation of RNA polymerase comes from studies of 
the prokaryotic cells of E. coli. Eukaryotic cells behave in a similar, though
more complicated, manner. One major difference between the two is that in
prokaryotic cells, transcription and translation (protein synthesis) may
occur almost simultaneously, whereas in eukaryotic cells there is a gap
between the two processes while the mRNA moves from the nucleus to the
ribosome. The other major difference is that RNA in eukaryotic cells almost
always requires processing after synthesis. Prokaryotic RNA is usually ready
immediately after synthesis. Processing includes adding a cap, adding a
poly(A) tail, and — in nearly all cases — splicing to remove introns.
Prokaryotic cells
RNA polymerase in E. coli contains four subunits that combine to form a
holoenzyme designated α2ββ'σ. The purpose of the σ subunit is to help find
the promoter and to help initiate RNA synthesis. Once synthesis begins, this
unit leaves the remainder, the core enzyme. The catalytic site in the core
enzyme contains two divalent metal ions, one of which stays with the core
and one that enters with the ribonucleoside triphosphate and leaves with 
284
Part V: Genetics: Why We Are What We Are 

the cleaved pyrophosphate. Three aspartate residues aid in the binding of the
metal ions. Although DNA polymerase and RNA polymerase have very differ-
ent overall structures, their active sites are similar.
In the absence of the σ subunit, RNA polymerase would bind tightly to DNA
at any point. When this unit is present, binding at other than a promoter site
is significantly lower. Due to its reduced affinity, the holoenzyme can slide
along the DNA strand until a σ subunit detects a promoter site. It binds to
this site more strongly than to other positions on the DNA strand. The effi-
ciency of this binding is one form of regulation. A number of σ subunits are
present, each designed to recognize a different promoter site.
It’s almost like tying knots in an anchor rope. A diver could swim upward
holding on to the rope, but a knot signals a spot to stop and decompress.
Once the RNA polymerase arrives at a promoter site, it becomes necessary to
unwind a 17 base-pair segment of the double helix and to unpair the bases.
This unwinding converts a closed promoter complex to an open promoter
complex. RNA polymerase is now ready to begin the RNA chain by incorpo-
rating the first nucleotide triphosphate. (Unlike DNA replication, no primer is
necessary.) This first nucleotide triphosphate is usually a pppG or a pppA,
which remains throughout transcription. This tap is at the 5' end of the new
RNA molecule, and growth begins when a new nucleotide links to the 3' posi-
tion (Figure 16-3).

Chapter 16: Transcribe This! RNA Transcription

Once the first two nucleotides link (through the formation of the linking phos-
phate diester) the σ subunit leaves. This allows the core enzyme to bind
more tightly to the substrate. A transcription bubble now forms that contains
the RNA polymerase, the unwound portion of the DNA, and the rapidly form-
ing nascent RNA. Initially a short segment of the new RNA forms a hybrid
helix with the DNA. This segment normally consists of about eight base 
pairs or one turn of the double helix. The growth rate is on the order of 50
nucleotides per second. (Compare this to DNA replication, which proceeds 
at about 800 nucleotides per second.) It is important to note that RNA poly-
merase does not “proofread” the new RNA. Thus, errors creep in at a higher
rate than in replication. However, because the products do not pass to the
next generation, there is no mutation or lasting effect. In any case, the next
RNA stand to form lacks this defect and behaves correctly. One bad RNA in
several hundred or more copies of the same gene is likely to have a minimal
influence on the cell.
Elongation proceeds until the RNA polymerase encounters a termination
signal, initiating a series of actions. At this point, formation of new phosphate
diesters ceases, the RNA-DNA hybrid separates, the portion of the DNA chain
that is still open rewinds, and the RNA polymerase separates from the DNA.
There are different termination signals. One simple one is a palindromic
(reading the same forward or backwards) GC-rich region followed by an AT
rich region. The palindromic region is self-complementry, and these bases
hydrogen bond to form a hairpin loop. The AT-rich region results in a number
of URNA-ADNA pairs, which have the weakest hydrogen bond interactions of all
types of pairs. The formation of this hairpin and the AT region destabilizes,
and the RNA-DNA hybrid and the nascent RNA begin to leave. See Figure 16-4.

Not all termination signals contain a hairpin and a U-rich segment. In at least
some cases, RNA polymerase needs help. Evidence for this came from the
observation that in vitro RNA chains were often longer than in vivo chains for
the same RNA. Clearly, the in vitro RNA polymerase was unable to terminate
elongation. The missing aid was a protein known as the rho factor (ρ). This
protein wraps about the nascent RNA soon after the RNA exits the transcrip-
tion bubble. In the presence of RNA, the ρ protein hydrolyzes ATP, which 
supplies energy. The protein first attaches to an RNA segment that is poor 
in guanine and rich in cytosine. Rho moves along the nascent RNA until it
encounters the transcription bubble. At this point, it breaks the RNA-DNA
hybrid and separates the nascent RNA. Other proteins serve a similar func-
tion as the rho factor.
In prokaryotic cells, mRNA is either ready or nearly ready to function immedi-
ately after release from the transcription (translation may begin before tran-
scription terminates). However, both tRNA and rRNA require cleavage and other
modifications of the nascent RNA chain. Various nucleases cleave the RNA in a
very precise manner. It is possible to get more than one gene from a long
nascent RNA strand. Processing may require the connection of a number of
nucleotides — for example, all tRNA molecules need a CCA tail to function cor-
rectly. In some cases, there may be modification of the bases or ribose units.
Eukaryotic cells
Unlike prokaryotic cells, transcription and translation occur in different
regions of the cell, leading to greater control of gene expression. Another dif-
ference is that eukaryotic cells extensively process mRNA in addition to rRNA

and tRNA. After RNA polymerase action, mRNA acquires a cap and a poly(A)
tail. Nearly all mRNA molecules are spliced. Splicing involves removal of
introns with the remaining exons being connected. Ninety percent of the
nascent RNA may be introns.
Eukaryotic cells typically contain three types of RNA polymerase. Type I RNA
polymerase (in the nucleolus) produces most forms of rRNA. Type II (in the
nucleoplasm) produces mRNA and snRNA. And type III (in the nucleoplasm)
produces tRNA and small rRNA molecules. (Actually, these polymerases only
produce the pre-RNA forms of these molecules.)
Each of the three polymerases has a distinct type of promoter. These promot-
ers may be in the same upstream sites as in prokaryotic cells, in downstream
sites, or within the genes themselves. In addition to promoters, there may be
enhancers. Enhancers, though not promoters, increase the effectiveness of a
promoter. Enhancers for a single promoter may occur in different positions
on the DNA chain and are important for gene regulation. Both promoters and
most enhancers are on the same side of the DNA chain as the gene they regu-
late; for this reason, they are cis-acting elements. The promoters, as discussed
earlier, are typically a TATA box (usually between –30 and –100), the CAAT
box, and the GC box (both are usually between –40 and –150). Enhancers may
appear upstream, downstream, or within the gene about to undergo tran-
scription. Enhancers that are present on the opposite DNA chain are trans-
acting factors, known as transcription factors, on the other DNA chain. 
The typical series of events is that the transcription factor TFIID binds to the
TATA box (TF stands for transcription factor, and the II means RNA polymerase
II). Binding is the result of a small component of TFIID known as TBP (TATA-
box-binding protein), which has an extremely high affinity for the TATA-box.
When TBP binds to the DNA, substantial changes occur in DNA, including
some degree of unwinding.
Other components utilized in transcription later attach to the TBP. These are,
in order: TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIIF, RNA polymerase II, and finally TFIIE. This final
group is the basal transcription complex. This example illustrates only one 
of numerous transcription factor initiations.
In eukaryotic cells, nearly all, if not all, products of transcription (precursors)
undergo further processing before they reach their final active form. In gen-
eral, tRNA precursors need to have the 5' leader removed, splicing to remove
any and all introns, replacement of the poly(U) tail with a CCA sequence, and
possible modification of some of the bases. Each of these processes requires
one or more enzymes.
The precursors to the various forms of mRNA normally require the most
modification. These precursors need, amongst other things, a 5' cap and a 3'
poly(A) tail. The caps are cap 0, cap 1, and cap 2 — the numbers refer to the
number of methylated ribose sugars (Figure 16-5). Caps are not present on
tRNA, snRNA, or rRNA. 
288
Part V: Genetics: Why We Are What We Are 

Most mRNA has a poly(A) tail not encoded by DNA. Usually, addition of this
tail is preceded by cleavage of an intron portion of the mRNA precursor. The
series AAUAAA signals where the cleavage will occur. This series is only part
of the signal — the other part is uncertain. After cleavage, a poly(A) poly-
merase adds about 250 adenylate residues to the 3' end. The exact purpose of
the tail is uncertain. It appears to enhance translation and increase the life-
time of the mRNA molecule.
In some cases, it is necessary to edit some mRNA precursors. Editing refers to
an alteration of the base sequence other than that caused by splicing. An
example is to chemically change one base into another. An example of editing
occurs in the mRNA that encodes for apolipoprotein B (apo B). The entire
protein contains 4,536 residues. However, a related 2,152-residue form is also
important. The longer form, synthesized in the liver, is useful in the transport
of lipids within the liver. The smaller form, synthesized in the small intestine,
interacts with dietary fats. The same mRNA is responsible for both forms of
the protein. In the small intestine, a deaminase acts on a specific cytosine
and converts it to a uracil, which changes a CAA codon (Gln) to a UAA codon
(stop) — which truncates the protein chain to yield the smaller form.
Splicing is a very common form of modification of all forms of RNA. Splicing
involves the removal of introns and the joining of the exons to yield the final
RNA molecule. Splicing must be very precise, as a miss by one base alters the
entire sequence of codons present.
A number of different introns need to be removed. In eukaryotic cells, the
intron begins with a GU and ends with an AG. Further refinement is present in
vertebrates, where GU is the end of the sequence AGGUAAGU. A variety of
AG sequences are found in higher eukaryotic cells. In general, one end of the
intron loops about and connects to a point (the branch point) on the intron
chain. Joining of the exons present then proceeds. 
Spliceosomes are important in the splicing of mRNA precursors. These assem-
blages contain the mRNA precursors, several snRNAs, and proteins known as
splicing factors. A group of snRNAs labeled U1, U2, U4, U5, and U6 are impor-
tant. U1 binds to the 5' end of the splice site and then to the 3' end. U2 binds
to the branch point, U4 blocks U6 until the appropriate moment, U5 binds to
the 5' splice site, and U6 catalyzes the splicing. There are alternate splicing
procedures.
It should be noted that alternate splicing can lead to production of different
proteins from the same RNA.

To Heck with Da Vinci: The Genetic Code
Just as DNA serves as the template for the generation of RNA, mRNA serves
as the template for the generation of protein. In order to synthesize the
appropriate protein, there needs to be a species that interacts with this tem-
plate to assure the incorporation of the correct amino acid. The interaction
species is tRNA. This relatively small form of RNA has two important regions:
a template recognition site and the appropriate amino acid. The template
recognition site is an anticodon, which corresponds to a codon on the
mRNA. Attachment of the amino acid to the tRNA is by the action of an
aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase. Each of the 20 amino acids has at least one

specific synthetase. This enzyme attaches the specific amino acid to the 3'
terminal adenosine of the tRNA (Figure 16-6).
Codons
The genetic code contains the information necessary for the synthesis of pro-
teins and consists of a set of three-letter words made from an alphabet con-
taining four letters. Each three-letter word is a codon. This vocabulary is
universal as it applies to all known living organisms.
The four letters are as follows:
 A, for adenine
 C, for cytosine
 G, for guanine
 U, for uracil
The four letters give a total dictionary containing 64 words. Sixty-one of these
words code for specific amino acids, and the remaining three words code for
no amino acid. The codons coding for no amino acid are the “stop” signals.
Because there are only 20 amino acids to code for, the presence of 61 codons
means that some amino acids can come from more than one codon.

Analysis of the genetic code shows that two amino acids — methionine (see
Figure 16-7) and tryptophan — only have one codon each. At the other
extreme, three amino acids — arginine, leucine, and serine — each have six
codons. The remaining 15 amino acids have at least two codons each. Amino
acids with more codons are more abundant in proteins. Examining Table 16-1
shows that most synonyms (codons coding for the same amino acid) are
grouped together and differ by a single base, usually the last base in the
codon. Other correlations are present in the table. See what others you can
find. The similarity of synonyms limits potential damage due to mutations.

Alpha and omega
Although tRNA does not read the termination sequences, UAA, UAG, and
UGA, specific proteins known as release factors read them. When a release
factor binds to the ribosome, it triggers the release of the new protein, and
release of the protein signals new synthesis to begin.
The stop signals are rather obvious on the Table 16-1, but what about the
start? What signals the initiation of protein synthesis? The initiation
sequence is usually AUG, the codon for methionine (Figure 16-8). In eukary-
otic cells, additional factors come into play. In many bacteria, fMet (formyl-
methionine) is the initial amino acid (refer to Figure 16-7), which AUG usually
codes for; however, GUG works sometimes.

Chapter 16: Transcribe This! RNA Transcription

The genetic code is nearly universal — the codons correspond to the same
amino acid in most cases. A few exceptions are known. For example, the code
in mitochondrial DNA has several differences from normal DNA. In mitochon-
drial DNA, UGA is not a stop signal, but a codon for tryptophan. 
In prokaryotic cells, coding for proteins is continuous, but this is not always
true in the case of eukaryotic cells. In some mammals and birds, most genes
are discontinuous. For example in the gene encoding for β-globin, there are
regions that do not encode for a portion of protein. The gene contains about
1,660 base pairs — about 250 pairs on each end, plus an additional 500 pair
segment code for the protein. These coding segments are exons. Two seg-
ments, one of about 120 base pairs and one of about 550 base pairs, do not
code for protein. These non-coding regions are introns. The entire gene has,
in sequence, a 240-pair exon, a 120-pair intron, a 500-pair exon, a 550-pair
intron, and a 250-pair exon.
If an mRNA forms from a gene containing introns, it needs to undergo modifi-
cation before it is of use. It is necessary to cut the intron regions from the
mRNA and to splice the exon ends together to form the final mRNA molecule.
In most cases, the intron portion begins with a GU and ends with a pyrimidine-
rich segment ending with an AG. This combination signals the intron domain.
Models of Gene Regulation
The organism does not need to produce all the different proteins all the time.
To control which proteins form at which time requires some form of gene reg-
ulation. When the organism requires a specific protein, it is necessary to
“switch on” a certain gene — and once there is a sufficient quantity of that
protein the gene must be “switched off.” Control may occur either at the 
transcription level (gene regulation) or at the translation level.
In this section we examine processes in prokaryotic cells and then move on
to the more complicated processes that take place in eukaryotic cells. The
examination of the simpler mechanisms in prokaryotic cells gives insight into
the processes in eukaryotic cells — the basic processes are similar.
As usual, our prokaryotic example is E. coli. Insight on gene regulation came
when the diet of the E. coli was changed from glucose-rich to lactose-rich. 
For the cells to utilize this alternate energy source, they must generate the
enzyme β-galactosidase. This enzyme is normally available at very low levels —
a situation that quickly changes after replacing the glucose with lactose. One
clue to the mechanism was that as the levels of β-galactosidase increased, so
did the levels of galactoside permease (which transports lactose into the cell)
and thiogalactoside transacetylase (which detoxifies other materials trans-
ported by galactoside permease). Thus, one change in the environment trig-
gered multiple enzymes. This coordinated triggering of gene expression is
294
Part V: Genetics: Why We Are What We Are 

called an operon. Francois Jacob and Jacques Monad proposed the operon
model to explain gene regulation.
The Jacob-Monod (operon) model
The simultaneous change in the levels of three different enzymes by one
change in the environment suggested a link between the control mechanisms,
and the operon model was created to account for this link. This model
requires a regulator gene that affects a number of structural genes and an
operator site. The operator and associated structural genes constitute the
operon. The regulator gene is responsible for producing a repressor protein.
The repressor protein binds to the operator site and prevents expression of
the structural genes, as shown in Figure 16-9. The lac operon is one of the
better understood operons.
The multiple structural genes produce one large mRNA, and this single RNA
strand is capable of generating a set of proteins. An mRNA that is capable of
encoding for multiple proteins is polygenic or polycistronic.
The lac operon
The lac operon is the model regulatory system that, since its discovery in
1961, has provided extensive insight into how a cell regulates its genome.
Figure 16-10 illustrates the lac operon.

Chapter 16: Transcribe This! RNA Transcription

The lac operator is a palindromic DNA sequence with a twofold symmetry
axis. The repeat is not always a perfect palindrome. (Many protein-DNA inter-
actions involve a matching of symmetry.) The lac operator is as follows, with
the center axis in bold:
TGTGTGGAATTGTGAGCGGATAACAATTTCACACA
ACACACCTTAACACTCGCCTAATGTTAAAGTGTGT
The lac repressor is a dimeric protein that can join to form a tetramer. In the
absence of lactose, the repressor tightly binds to the operator. The presence
of the repressor prevents RNA polymerase from unwinding the DNA strand to
initiate transcription. 
The presence of lactose is not the direct trigger of the lac operon; the trigger
is allolactose. Both lactose and allolactose are disaccharides composed of
galactose and glucose (Figure 16-11). In lactose there is an α-1,4 linkage,
whereas in allolactose the linkage is an α-1,6. Allolactose results when the 
few molecules of β-galactosidase that are normally present in the cell first
encounter lactose. This disaccharide along with a few similar molecules is an
inducer of the lac operon. The inducer binds to the repressor and reduces
the affinity of the latter to operator on the DNA. With its affinity reduced, the
repressor detaches from the operator, and the DNA segment is now open for
business.

When transcription begins, all three structural genes become active, and the
cell begins producing β-galactosidase, galactoside permease, and thiogalacto-
side transacetylase. This continues until the lactose and hence the allolactose
concentration falls so that the repressor proteins are available to reattach to
the DNA.
Other prokaryotic regulators
The pur repressor affects the genes responsible for the biosynthesis of
purines and, to a lesser extent, pyrimidines. This protein is similar in struc-
ture to the lac repressor; however, the pur repressor only binds to the 
operator after another molecule binds to the repressor. Therefore, while the
binding of another molecule releases the lac repressor, the binding of another
molecule causes the pur repressor to bind. The other molecule has an oppo-
site affect. In the case of the pur repressor, the other molecule is a corepressor.
There are also regulators that stimulate transcription instead of repressing it.
The catabolite activator protein (CAP) is one example. This protein interacts
with the promoter and, along with two cAMP molecules, interacts with RNA
polymerase. This interaction leads to stimulating the initiation of transcrip-
tion of certain genes.
Regulation of eucaryotic genes
Although there are similarities, the regulation of genes in eukaryotic cells is
more complex than in prokaryotic cells. One reason for this is that the typical
eukaryotic genome is much larger than the typical prokaryotic genome.
Another source of complexity is that many eukaryotic cells are part of a larger
organism and do not serve the same purpose as other cells do within the same
organism. For example, although some of the proteins are the same, a liver cell
must produce a different overall set of proteins than a heart cell does.
Histones
Eukaryotic DNA has a group of proteins associated with it. These small, basic
proteins are called histones. They are basic because approximately 25 percent
of the amino acid residues present are either arginine or lysine. These are
tightly bound to the DNA and total approximately half of the mass of a chro-
mosome. A complex of the cell’s DNA and associated protein is a chromatin,
and there are five important histones present in chromatin: H1 — and four
that associate with each other: H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. 
A chromatin apparently consists of repeat units consisting of two copies each
of H2A, H2B, H3, and H4, with a strand of DNA consisting of about 200 base
pairs tightly wrapped around this histone octomer. Each of these repeating
units is a nucleosome. The wrapping of the DNA to form a nucleosome yields
a significant compaction of the DNA. Research indicates that about 145 of 
297
Chapter 16: Transcribe This! RNA Transcription

the 200 base pairs are actually associated with the histone octomer, and the
remaining base pairs are linker DNA that link one histone octomer to the
next. Histone H1 usually binds to linker DNA.
The eight histones in a histone octomer are arranged into a tetramer with 
the composition (H3)2(H4)2 and two dimers each with the composition
(H2A)(H2B). All the histone proteins have long tails rich in arginine and
lysine residues that extend out of the core. Modification of these tails is
important for gene regulation.
The structure of chromatin is a factor in eukaryotic gene regulation. For a
gene to be available for transcription, the tightly packed chromatin structure
must open. In addition, the structure regulates access to regulatory sites on
DNA. Enhancers disturb this structure, explaining why enhancers can have
an effect on the expression of a gene even though the enhancer site may be
thousands of base pairs away from the gene. Certain enhancers only occur 
in specific types of cells. Thus, the genes they enhance are only expressed in
these cells. For example, the gene to produce insulin is expressed only 
in pancreatic cells.
A modification of DNA can also inhibit gene expression. Approximately 70
percent of the 5'-CpG-3' sequences in mammals have the cytosine methylated.
The distribution of the methylated cytosines (Figure 16-12) varies with cell
type. Regions in chromatins necessary for gene expression in that cell are
hypomethylated (have fewer methylated cytosines), relative to similar regions
in cells where no expression of the gene occurs. The presence of the methyl
group interferes with the binding of enhancers and promoters.
Mediating transcription
Eukaryotic cells require a variety of transcription factors to initiate transcrip-
tion — no factor can carry out the entire process on its own. This is called
combinatorial control, and it is necessary in organisms with multiple cell
types and helpful in other eukaryotic cells.
A number of nonpolar molecules, such as the steroid hormones, can easily
pass through the hydrophobic cell membrane and bind to receptor proteins.
They are very specific. Estrogen (Figure 16-13) is one example of a steroid
hormone. Such molecules are known as ligands.

The ligand binds to a specific site — called, helpfully, the ligand-binding site —
which is present near the end of a receptor protein. This portion of the protein
contains many nonpolar residues, which have an affinity for hydrophobic mole-
cules. Receptor proteins that bind hormones are called nuclear hormone recep-
tors. There is a DNA binding site near the center of the protein that contains
eight cysteine residues, which are necessary to bind zinc ions, four residues 
for each. The presence of the zinc ions stabilize structure and led to the name
zinc finger domains. (There are other cysteine residues and zinc ions nearby.)
The binding of a molecule to the ligand-binding site causes a significant struc-
tural rearrangement of the protein. This situation would seem to be similar to
the lac repressor in prokaryotic cells; however, experiments indicate that
there is no significant alteration in binding affinity
The next part of the puzzle involves a number of small proteins known as
coactivators. Near the center of each of these are three regions with the pat-
tern Leu-X-X-Leu-Leu. Each of these regions generates a short hydrophobic α-
helix. These three helices bind to a hydrophobic region on the ligand-binding
region. The presence of the ligand appears to enhance the binding of a coacti-
vator. (A receptor protein may act as a repressor, especially in the presence
of a corepressor.)
Just what are the roles of coactivators and corepressors? Their effectiveness
appears to be linked to their ability to covalently bond to the tails of the his-
tones. Histone acetyltransferases (HATs) catalyze this modification of the 
histone tails (a process that is reversed by histone deacetylase enzymes —
see Figure 16-14). This process changes a very polar (positively charged lysine)
to a much less polar (neutral) amide, resulting in a significant reduction in the
affinity of the tail to the associated DNA. To a lesser degree, it reduces the affin-
ity of the entire histone to the associated DNA. The reduction in the affinity
allows access of a portion of the DNA to transcription.

The acetyated lysine residues also affect the acetyllysine-binding domain (the
bromodomain) present in many of the eukaryotic transcription regulatory
proteins. 
There are two important bromodomain-containing proteins: One of these is a
large complex of ten proteins that binds to the TATA-box-binding protein that
is responsible for the transcription of many genes. The other proteins contain-
ing bromodomains are part of large complexes known as chromatin-remodeling
engines. As the name implies, these proteins alter the structure of the chro-
matins, which changes the behavior of the chromatin.
All these factors alter the availability of portions of the DNA structure to tran-
scription. Once the DNA becomes open, the procedures discussed earlier in
the chapter come into play.

Translation: Protein Synthesis
In This Chapter
 Talking about translation
 Looking at protein synthesis 
 Examining eukaryotic cells 
 Discussing the Human Genome Project 
You are no doubt familiar with the process of translation — converting
text from one language into another. The process of translation in bio-
chemistry does exactly the same thing.
Hopefully Not Lost in Translation
Translation is the process where the four-letter alphabet of the nucleic acids
becomes the twenty-letter alphabet of proteins. In doing so, genetic informa-
tion is passed on. Translation occurs in the cell’s ribosomes, which contain
ribosomal RNA (rRNA). The information necessary for translation travels
from the cell nucleus to the ribosomes via messenger RNA (mRNA). The mes-
senger RNA binds to the smaller ribosomal body, and transfer RNA (tRNA)
brings amino acids to it.
Why translation is necessary
The purpose of translation is to put together specific amino acids in a specific
order to produce a specific protein. Messenger RNA provides the template or
blueprint for this process. To utilize this template, something must bring the
amino acids to the mRNA, and that thing is transfer RNA (tRNA). Transfer RNA
has two important sites. One site is for the attachment of a specific amino
acid. For example, only one specific type of tRNA will transfer the amino 
acid methionine. The other site is the recognition site, which contains an 

anticodon. An anticodon is a sequence of three bases that match a codon on
the mRNA. A codon sequence of AUG on the mRNA matches the UAC anti-
codon on a tRNA. All of this takes place in the ribosome, home of rRNA.
Home, home in the ribosome
The ribosome is the factory that produces proteins. Thousands of ribosomes
are present in even the simplest of cells. They are complex units composed of
RNA and protein. It is possible to dissociate a prokaryotic ribosome into two
units. One unit is the 50S, or large unit, and the other is the 30S, or small unit.
The large unit contains 34 different proteins, labeled L1 through L34, and two
RNA molecules, labeled 23S and 5S. The small unit contains 21 different pro-
teins, labeled S1 through S21, and an RNA molecule labeled 16S. The RNA
molecules in the ribosomes act as transfer RNA in translation.
A prokaryotic ribosome contains three rRNA molecules (23S, 16S, and 5S),
one copy of proteins S1 through S21, two copies of L7 and L12, and one each
of the other L1-L34 proteins. L7 and L12 are identical except that L7 has an
acetylated amino terminus. S20 and L26 are identical. Mixing the constituents
in vitro leads to the two subunits reconstituting themselves. A version of the
structure of the 16S form of ribosomal RNA appears in Figure 17-1.
The Translation Team
A number of players, along with the rRNA, must interact in order to form a
protein molecule. In addition, the structure of the ribosome is important to
controlling protein synthesis. Both the rRNA and protein molecules control
this structure. One possibly helpful analogy is the game of football.

Part V: Genetics: Why We Are What We Are 

The team captain: rRNA 
RNA makes up approximately two-thirds of the mass of a ribosome. The three
mRNA units play a key role in the shape and function of the ribosome (the
proteins apparently fine-tune the shape and structure of the ribosome). The
three mRNA form from the cleaving and processing of transcribed 30S RNA. 
A significant portion of each of the rRNA molecules have numerous duplex
regions (short stretches of base-paired RNA).
The 30S and 50S rRNA subunits combine to form a 70S ribosome, which holds
an mRNA in place during translation. There are also three sites for various
tRNA molecules: the E, P, and A sites. The E site is the exit site. A tRNA occu-
pies this position after delivery of its amino acid and just before exiting the
ribosome. The P site is the peptidyl site, which holds the tRNA containing
either the initial amino acid or the C-terminal amino acid of a protein chain.
Finally, the A site is the aminoacyl site, which holds the tRNA attached to the
next amino acid in sequence. When the 30S and 50S subunits join, they create
A and E sites at the interface of the subunits. The P site of the 50S unit is the
opening of a tunnel through which the growing protein chain passes out of
the ribosome.
Here’s the snap: mRNA
The base sequence of the mRNA is read in the 5' →3' direction, and tran-
scription occurs in this same direction. (Prokaryotic cells sometimes take
advantage of this by beginning translation before transcription is over. This
situation cannot occur in eukaryotic cells because the E sites of transcription
and translation are physically separated.) The mRNA resulting from tran-
scription gains a cap and a poly(A) tail before it ventures out of the nucleus
on its trip to the ribosome.
Translation does not begin at the 5' terminus of the mRNA molecule. Just as
there is a “stop” signal to terminate translation, there is a “start” signal. The
5' terminus base-pairs with the 3' terminus of the 16S rRNA. This region is
normally about 30 nucleotides in length (a portion of this region, called the
Shine-Dalgarno sequence, is purine-rich).
Shortly after this sequence is the start signal. In most cases, the start signal
is AUG (methionine), though there are instances where the signal is GUG
(valine). In E. coli, the first amino acid is formylmethionine instead of methio-
nine. The formylmethionine is usually removed soon after translation begins.
In prokaryotic cells, there may be more than one start and stop signal because
many of the mRNA molecules are polygenic (polycistronic) — that is, they
produce more than one protein. The structures of methionine and formylme-
thionine attached to tRNA are illustrated in Figure 17-2.
303
Chapter 17: Translation: Protein Synthesis

Carrying the ball: tRNA
Several features are common to all forms of tRNA. Each form of tRNA is a
single strand containing between 73 and 93 nucleotides. There are between
seven and fifteen unusual bases (not one of the usual four, A, C, G, or U) in
each molecule. Approximately half of the nucleotides present are base-
paired. The activated amino acid is attached to the hydroxyl group at the 3'-
end of the chain. The hydroxyl group is on the adenosine residue of a CCA
segment. The other end, the 5'-end, is phosphorylated. The phosphorylation
usually is a pG. The anticodon is contained in a loop near the center of the
molecule.
Many of the unusual bases are methylated or dimethylated forms of A, C, G,
or U, which are usually the result of post-transcription modification of the
molecule. The presence of the methyl groups interferes with the formation 
of some base pairs, which prevents certain additional interactions. Methyl
groups are nonpolar, so their presence makes regions of the tRNA hydropho-
bic, which affects their interaction with ribosomal proteins and syntheses.
The unusual bases include dihydrouridine, dimethylguanosine, inosine,
methylguanosine, methylinosine, pseudouridine, and ribothymidine. Inosine,
shown in Figure 17-3, is part of the anticodon. Many of these are in or near
the bends in structure of tRNA.
There are five regions, shown in Figure 17-4, that are not base-paired. (Note that
the structure of tRNA shown in Figure 17-4 is not the actual three-dimensional
structure of tRNA.) Starting at the 5'-end, the unpaired regions are, in order, 
the DHU loop, the anticodon loop, the extra arm, the TψC loop, and the 3-CCA
terminus. (The name of the DHU loop derives from the presence of several 
dihydrouracil residues. The anticodon loop contains the segment that recog-
nizes the codon on the mRNA, and the extra arm contains a variable number of

The anticodon is present in the 5' →3' direction, and it base-pairs to a codon
in the 3' →5' direction. This matches the first base of the anticodon with the
third base of the codon. (Don’t forget the convention of writing base
sequences in the 5' →3' direction.)
Charging up the middle: 
Amino acid activation
It is imperative that the correct amino acid attaches to the tRNA because the
presence of an incorrect amino acid or the absence of any amino acid would
be devastating to translation. Connection of the amino acid to the tRNA acti-
vates the amino acid. Joining free amino acids is a nonspontaneous process,
however, connecting the amino acid to the tRNA changes the free amino acid
to a more reactive amino acid ester. The amino acid-tRNA combination is an
aminoacyl-tRNA or a charged tRNA (Figure 17-5).
Specific aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, called activating enzymes, catalyze the
activation reaction. The process begins with an amino acid and an ATP form-
ing an aminoacyl adenylate, which leads to the release of a pyrophosphate.
Figure 17-6 shows an aminoacyl adenylate.
There is a separate aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase for each amino acid.
The two classes of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are denoted Class I
(monomeric) and Class II (usually dimeric). Each class is responsible for ten
amino acids. The CCA arm adopts different structures when interacting with
members of the different classes, and ATP adopts a different conformation
when interacting with members of different classes. Most Class II examples
attach the amino acid as illustrated back in Figure 17-5, whereas Class I exam-
ples attach the amino acid to the alternate linking site. Some aspects of the
structure of tRNA appear in the schematic structure shown in Figure 17-4.
The conversion of an aminoacyl adenylate, once formed, remains tightly
bound to the synthetase until it can form an aminoacyl-tRNA. 
In order to make sure that the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase incorporates the
correct amino acid, the enzyme must take advantage of specific properties of
the amino acids. Examining the amino acids serine, valine, and threonine can
give some insight into the selection process. These three amino acids appear
in Figure 17-7, where they are drawn to emphasize similarities in the side-
chain. (Recall that the threonine side-chain is chiral, but the others are not.)
It is important to realize that there are size differences (–H for –CH3) and
306
Part V: Genetics: Why We Are What We Are 

hydrogen bonding differences (–OH can, but –CH3 cannot). The recognition
site has the proper size and composition to take advantage of these specific
properties. A significant species in this site is a zinc ion, which coordinates to
the enzyme and the amino acid.

Chapter 17: Translation: Protein Synthesis

Even with these differences, serine sometimes replaces threonine. Fortunately,
the enzyme includes an editing feature — the editing site is near the reaction
site, but it is not the same. Similar editing occurs in other aminoacyl-tRNA
synthetases. Amino acids, such as tryptophan, do not have closely similar
analogues; thus, editing is far less important in these cases.
The aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases need to be able to recognize the anticodon
present to make sure they interact with the appropriate tRNA, matching it to
the correct amino acid. The enzymes may recognize other features of the tRNA
structure. These features include the size of the extra arm and the hydropho-
bic character imparted by methylating some of the ribonucleotides.
Hooking Up: Protein Synthesis
The major steps in protein (polypeptide) synthesis are as follows:
 Activation
 Initiation
 Elongation
 Termination
These basics apply to all living organisms — there are no differences between
human translation, fungi translation, or tulip translation. Synthesis proceeds
from the amino to the carboxyl direction of the protein. 
In this section we discuss these in greater detail. These steps involve tRNA,
mRNA, and rRNA — along with a number of protein factors.
Activation
As mentioned earlier in this chapter, during activation an amino acid reacts
with ATP to give aminoacyl adenylate. The aminoacyl adenylate then reacts

with a specific tRNA to give aminoacyl-tRNA plus AMP. This constitutes one
of the players necessary for the translation game. 
Initiation
During initiation, an mRNA attaches to a ribosome by interacting, through the
Shine-Delgarno sequence, to the 30S rRNA subunit. Then the anticodon of the
first tRNA attaches to the AUG (or GUG) codon on the mRNA. This occupies
the P site of the 30S subunit. The amino acid extends into the P site of the 50S
subunit. The 30S and 50S portions of the rRNA combine to produce the 70S
ribosome. The combination of the two subunits allows the tRNA to interact
with both parts.
In order to initiate translation it is necessary to bring the mRNA and the first
tRNA to the ribosome. Three proteins, known as initiation factors, accomplish
this task: IF1, IF2, and IF3. First, the 30S ribosome subunit, IF1 and IF3, form a
complex. The two initiation factors bound to the 30S subunit interfere with a
premature joining of the 30S and 50S subunit without the necessary mRNA.
The remaining initiation factor, IF2, binds to GTP. The IF2-GTP combination
binds to the initiator-tRNA, and the IF2-GTP-initiator-tRNA unit binds to the
mRNA. Interaction of the Shine-Dalgarno sequence and the 16S rRNA manipu-
lates the incoming group into the correct position.
Combining all these units with the 30S subunit gives the 30S initiation com-
plex. Hydrolysis of the GTP as the 50S subunit approaches leads to expulsion
of the initiation factors. With the initiation factors out of the way, the remain-
ing moieties join to give the 70S initiation complex. (Wow, trying say that three
times fast!) Once this complex forms, elongation can begin.
Elongation
During elongation, a second activated tRNA comes into the A site (which is
adjacent to the P site) on the 30S subunit, where it binds to the appropriate
codon. The activated tRNA is brought to the A site by a protein known as
elongation factor Tu or EF-Tu. EF-Tu forms a complex with the activated tRNA
(in the GTP form), and this complex protects the ester linkage holding the
amino acid to the tRNA. In addition, the complex does not allow the activated
tRNA to enter the A site if there is not a codon-anticodon match. EF-Tu inter-
acts with all tRNAs except the initiator-tRNA. The energy needed for the EF-
Tu to leave the tRNA in the ribosome comes from the hydrolysis of the GTP
unit induced by the protein known as elongation factor Ts.
309
Chapter 17: Translation: Protein Synthesis

The two amino acids extend into the peptidyl transferase center of the ribo-
some. The amino group of the aminoacyl-tRNA from the A site is held in posi-
tion to attack the ester linkage of the aminoacyl-tRNA in the P site. The
catalyzed formation of the peptide bond occurs, accompanied by separation
from the tRNA in the P site. The protein is now attached to the A site (30S). 
With the loss of its amino acid, the tRNA no longer interacts in the same way
with the ribosome. The tRNA moves to the E site of the 50S subunit as the
next RNA, with its attached polypeptide, moves to the P (tunnel) site of the
same subunit. The ribosome must now move over (the fancy way to say it is
translocate) by one codon. For translocation to occur, it is necessary to
employ the elongation factor G enzyme (EF-G or translocase is the protein
that aids translocation). The hydrolysis of GTP to GDP supplies the energy
for the move. This move places the polypeptide-tRNA into the P site of the
30S subunit. At the same time, the amino acid–stripped tRNA disengages
from the mRNA and moves into the E site of the same subunit. Throughout
this process, the polypeptide chain remains in the P site of the 50S subunit.
The first tRNA leaves the E site. Now the elongation cycle can begin again
with the entry of another tRNA carrying the next amino acid. The process
continuously cycles until a “stop” signal codon. 
Termination
A “stop” signals termination, which results in the release of the protein, the
last tRNA, and the mRNA. 
Recall that the stop signals are UAA, UGA, and UAG.
Normal cells do not contain tRNAs with anticodons complementary to these
codons. However, proteins known as release factors (RF) recognize these
three codons. Release factor 1, RF1, recognizes UAA and UAG. Release factor
2, RF2, recognizes UAA and UGA. Release factor 3, RF3, is an intermediary
between RF1, RF2, and the ribosome. The release factors carry a water mole-
cule into the ribosome in place of an amino acid. The final reaction, the one
that releases the newly formed protein, is the hydrolysis of the last ester link-
age to a tRNA. The water brought in by the release factors is necessary for
this hydrolysis.
The 70S ribosome remains together for a short time. Dissociation of the com-
plex is mediated by a ribosome release factor and EF-G. GTP supplies the
energy for this process.
310
Part V: Genetics: Why We Are What We Are 

The wobble hypothesis
Experimental studies have found that even pure tRNA molecules are capable
of recognizing more than one codon. Biochemists developed the wobble
hypothesis to explain this behavior, and subsequent work has firmly estab-
lished this hypothesis.
The presence of the unusual base, inosine (shown back in Figure 17-3), in the
anticodon loop is the key to understanding the wobble hypothesis. This base
is capable of base pairing with adenine, cytosine, or uracil, allowing for some
variation, or wobble, in the matching of codon to anticodon. The presence of
inosine increases the number of different codons a particular tRNA can read.
The first two bases in the codon pair to the corresponding bases in the anti-
codon. The third base is the wobble position.
Review the table of codons (Table 16-1 in Chapter 16) and see which amino
acids depend only on the first two bases. Hint: Look at valine.
The base-pairing rules for the wobble hypothesis are shown in Table 17-1.
The presence of an A or C as the first base allows the reading of only one
codon. The presence of a G or U allows the reading of two codons, whereas
an I allows the reading of three codons. Inosine is a useful base for allowing
wobble; however, as Table 17-1 shows, it is only when the first anticodon
base is an A or a C that there is no wobble. In general, the base in the wobble
position forms weaker hydrogen bonds than normal because of the strain in
the environment. The weaker hydrogen bonding aids in the loss of the tRNA
after it delivers its amino acid.

Four codons code for valine, comprising a four-codon family. If you examine
three of the codons for valine: GUU, GUC, and GUA, they would all pair to the
anticodon CAI instead of the anticodons CAA, CAG, and CAU. For this reason,
311
Chapter 17: Translation: Protein Synthesis

one CAI anticodon replaces three other anticodons. The remaining valine
codon is GUG, which requires the synthesis of only two types of tRNA instead
of four. Other four-codon families also work this way.
The only cases where the codons for a particular amino acid differ in the first
two bases are the six-codon families, which are those of arginine, leucine, and
serine. These families require three different tRNAs. 
The presence of wobble reduces the number of necessary tRNAs in a cell
from 61 to 31. However, cells usually have some number of tRNAs between
these extremes. All the tRNAs coding for a specific amino acid require only
one aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase.
Variation in Eukaryotic Cells 
All cells follow the same basic pattern for translation. However, eukaryotic
cells show some variations. More proteins are necessary to mediate transla-
tion, and the steps are, in general, more complicated.
Ribosomes
In eukaryotic cells, the ribosomes contain a 60S subunit and a 40S subunit,
which combine to produce an 80S ribosome. The 40S subunit contains an 18S
rRNA analogous to the 16S in the 30S subunit. There are three rRNA compo-
nents in the 60S subunit: a 5S and a 23S, analogous to the 5S and the 23S of
the prokaryotic 50S subunit, and a unique 5.8S rRNA.
Initiator tRNA 
In eukaryotic cells, the initiator amino acid is methionine instead of formyl-
methionine. As in prokaryotic cells, a special tRNA is necessary for the first
tRNA — a modification of the normal methionine-carrying tRNA.
Initiation 
AUG is the only initiator codon in eukaryotic cells, and this is always the AUG
nearest the 5' end of the mRNA. There is no purine-rich sequence immedi-
ately before this as in prokaryotic cells. The 40S ribosome subunit attaches
to the mRNA cap and moves base by base in the 3' direction until it reaches

The Human Genome Project 
The U.S. Human Genome Project was begun in
1990. It was originally scheduled to last for 15
years but because of rapid advances in the field
of biotechnology it finished two years ahead of
schedule in 2003. The U.S. Department of Energy
and the National Institutes of Health coordinated
the projects.
Goals
The Project had the following goals:
 Identify all the 20,000–25,000 genes in
human DNA.
 Determine the sequences of the approxi-
mately 3 billion base pairs in human DNA.
 Store the information in databases.
 Improve data analysis tools.
 Transfer the developed technology to the
private sector.
 Address the ethical, legal, and social issues
associated with the project.
In addition to human DNA, researchers also stud-
ied the genetic blueprints of E. coli, a common
bacterium found in humans as well as mice and
fruit flies. The goal of transferring the technology
to the private sector was included to develop the
infant biotechnology industry and encourage the
development of new medical applications.
Potential Benefits 
Some potential benefits of the Human Genome
Project include the following:
 Improved disease diagnosis
 Earlier detection of genetic predispositions
to disease
 Drug design and gene therapy
 Creation of new biofuels
 More effective ways of detecting environ-
mental pollutants
 Studying evolution through mutations in 
lineages
 Forensic identification of subjects through
DNA analysis
 Establishing paternity
 Matching organ donors and patients
 Creation of insect- and disease-resistant
crops
 Creation of biopesticides
 Increased productivity of crops and farm
animals
Many of these potential benefits are showing up
in our everyday life already.
Ethical, Legal, and Social Issues 
One of the unique aspects of the Human Genome
Project was that it was the first large scientific
project that studied and addressed potential eth-
ical, legal, and social implications that arose from
the data generated from the study. Questions
such as the following were addressed:
 Who should have access to personal
genetic information?
 Who controls and owns genetic information?
 How reliable and useful is fetal genetic 
testing?
 How will genetic tests be checked for relia-
bility and accuracy?
 Do parents have the right to test their chil-
dren for adult-onset diseases?
 Do people’s genes influence their behavior?
 Where is the line between medical treat-
ment and enhancement?
 Are genetically modified foods safe for
humans?
Many questions have been raised — but, as yet,
few answers have resulted.

an AUG codon. The hydrolysis of ATP by helicases powers this process. Many
more initiation factors are present in eukaryotic cells. A eukaryotic initiation
factor has the symbol eIF instead of IF. 
Elongation and termination 
The EF-Tu and EF-Ts prokaryotic elongation factors have the eukaryotic
counterparts EF1α and EF1βγ. Translocation is driven by eukaryotic EF2 with
the aid of GTP. Only one release factor, eRF1, is present in eukaryotic cells
instead of the two factors in prokaryotic cells. To prevent the reassembly of
the two ribosome subunits, eIF3 functions like the IF3 protein in prokaryotic
cells.

Ten Great Applications 
of Biochemistry
In This Chapter
 Examining tests
 Checking out genetically modified foods
 Considering cloning
I
n this chapter, we briefly look at some of the biochemical applications and
tests that have changed our everyday lives. Although these are just a few
of the hundreds of examples we could have chosen, we feel that all of these
have made and continue to make a significant impact on society. And we
hope you realize that more applications are being discovered almost daily. 
Ames Test
The Ames test is a test that is used to determine whether a substance will
affect (mutate) the structure of DNA. In this test salmonella bacteria is
exposed to the chemical under question (food additives, for example), and
changes in the way the bacteria grows are measured. Many substances that
cause mutations in this bacteria also cause cancer in animals and humans.
Indeed, this test is used today to screen chemicals for their potential ability
to cause cancer in humans.
Pregnancy Testing
There are two types of pregnancy tests — one uses a urine sample and the
other a blood sample. Both detect the presence of the hormone human chori-
onic gonadotropin (hCG). This hormone is produced by the placenta shortly
after implantation of the embryo into the uterine walls and accumulates

rapidly in the body in the first few days after implantation. Home pregnancy
tests, urine tests, are typically around 97 percent accurate if done two weeks
after implantation. Blood tests, performed in a clinic, are more costly but can
detect pregnancy as early as a week after implantation.
HIV Testing
Tests have been developed to screen for the presence of the human immun-
odeficiency virus. These tests may be done on urine, blood serum, or saliva
and detect HIV antigens, antibodies, or nucleic acids (RNA). The nucleic acid
tests (NAT) detect a 142-base sequence located on one of the HIV genes. Most
blood banks use a combination of tests to ensure accuracy. 
Breast Cancer Testing
Most breast cancer is not hereditary, but in 5–10 percent of cases, there is a
heredity linkage. The vast majority of these cases is due to mutations in two
genes: Breast Cancer-1 gene (BRCA1) and the Breast Cancer-2 gene (BRCA2),
which were discovered in 1994 and 1995, respectively. Females who inherit 
a mutation in either one of these genes have a greatly increased chance of
developing breast cancer over their lifetime. Postive tests for these muta-
tions allow the individual to schedule increased screening tests at a more 
frequent rate than the general population.
Prenatal Genetic Testing
Prenatal genetic testing refers to testing the fetus for potential genetic defects.
Tests commonly are performed on blood or tissue samples from the fetus.
This may involve amniocentesis — collection of a sample of amniotic fluid
that contains cells from the fetus — or collection of blood from the umbilical
cord. Tests such as these are used to detect chromosomal abnormalities,
such as Down syndrome or birth defects such as spina bifida.
PKU Screening
Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a metabolic disorder in which the individual is miss-
ing an enzyme called phenylalanine hydroxylase. Absence of this enzyme
allows the buildup of phenylalanine, which can lead to mental retardation. 
318
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

All states in the United States require PKU testing of all newborns. Infants
who test positive are placed on a diet low in phenylalanine, allowing them to
develop normally. Check out cans of soft drinks, and you will find a warning
on many of them that they contain phenylalanine.
Genetically Modified Foods
Biochemists have developed the ability to transfer genes from one organism
into other organisms, including plants and animals. This allows the creation
of crops that are more pest and disease resistant and animals that are more
disease resistant. Genetic modification can also be used to increase the yield
of milk, eggs, or meat. In 1993, the first genetically modified food was given a
license for human consumption from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
It was a new tomato called Flavr Savr, which was resistant to rotting. However,
the public has been slow to accept genetically altered foods and afraid of
unforeseen effects on the population and environment.
Genetic Engineering
Genetic engineering involves taking a gene from one organism and placing it
into another. The recipient may be a bacteria or a plant or an animal. One of
the most well-known examples of genetic engineering involves the hormone
insulin. Diabetes use to be treated with insulin derived from pigs or cows,
and although very similar to human insulin, these animal-derived insulins
were not identical and caused problems for some individuals. Biochemists
solved this problem by inserting the gene for human insulin into bacteria.
The bacteria, through the process of translation, created human insulin. 
(See Chapter 17 for much more on translation.)
Cloning
In 1996, Dolly the sheep was cloned — the first mammal ever cloned from adult
animal cells. The cloned sheep was, of course, genetically identical to the
original adult sheep. This clone was created by taking cells from the udder 
of a 6-year-old ewe and growing them in the lab. They then took unfertilized
eggs and stripped the genetic material from them. Finally, they inserted the
genetic material grown in the lab into these cells and implanted them into the
uterus of another sheep. And Dolly was born. Since Dolly, many other animals
have been successfully cloned. However, there is worldwide debate on the
idea of cloning a human, which will surely continue for decades. 
319
Chapter 18: Ten Great Applications of Biochemistry

Gene-Replacement Therapy
In gene-replacement therapy, a modified or healthy gene is inserted into the
organism to replace a disease-causing gene. Commonly a virus that has been
altered to carry human DNA is used to deliver the healthy gene to the targeted
cells of the patient. This process was first used successfully in 1990 on a 4-
year-old patient who lacked an immune system due to a rare genetic disease
called severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). Individuals with SCID were
prone to life-threatening infections. They lead isolated lives, avoiding people
and commonly taking massive doses of antibiotics. Scientists removed white
blood cells from the patient, grew them in the lab, and inserted the missing
gene into the cells. They then inserted this genetically altered blood back
into the patient. The process allowed the child to develop normally and even
attend school, but the treatment must be repeated every few months.

Ten Biochemistry Careers
In This Chapter
 Cruising careers
 Finding out about professions
 Juggling jobs
B
ecause of recent advances in biochemistry and its related area biotech-
nology, many new professions have been created for the individual
majoring in biochemistry. Those who stop at the B.S. degree often find them-
selves working as technicians in a variety of industries, but for those who go
on for their M.S. or Ph.D. many more opportunities become possible.
Graduates at all levels find positions in a wide variety of career areas includ-
ing forensics, industrial chemistry, molecular biology, pharmacology, techni-
cal sales, virology, horticulture, immunology, forestry, and so on. We have
mentioned several careers throughout the book, so we are including here
careers one might not normally associate with the field of biochemistry.
Research Assistant
A research assistant works in the area of biochemical research and develop-
ment as part of a team. They may investigate new genetic tests, be involved
in genetic engineering or cloning, or help with the development of new drugs
or drug protocols. In addition to performing typical technical biochemical
procedures, the research assistant analyzes data and prepares technical
reports and summaries. Research assistants are often also involved in the
search for inventions that can lead to patents. They may eventually head up
their own research groups.

Plant Breeder
A plant breeder designs and implements plant breeding projects in conjunc-
tion with other research teams. They may be involved in the development 
of disease-resistant strains of crops or may search for ways to increase crop
yields using biochemical and biotechnological techniques. They may also be
involved in personnel management, public relations, and/or advising their
company about future projects and plant-breeding goals.
Quality Control Analyst
The quality control analyst conducts analyses of raw materials and the fin-
ished products coming off the production line. They collect data concerning
quality control test procedures and pinpoint sources of error. Along with
quality control engineers, the analyst ensures that the quality of the product
remains high. This is especially important, as you might imagine, when the
product could be a genetically modified virus or a genetically altered food.
Clinical Research Associate
Clinical research associates design and implement clinical research projects
such as a new drug protocol or the use of a new virus for gene therapy. They
may travel to the various field sites where the clinical trials are being con-
ducted to coordinate and/or supervise the trials. The clinical associate ana-
lyzes and evaluates data from the trials to ensure that clinical protocols were
followed. A background in nursing or pharmacology is useful.
Technical Writer
Anyone who has ever read a poorly written set of directions or technical
manual realizes the importance of a good technical writer. A technical writer
in the biochemical world edits and writes operating procedures, laboratory
manuals, clinical protocols, and so on. They ensure that these documents are
written in a way that meets government regulations. They may develop pro-
fessional development programs for staff members and write news releases.
Part of their job is to take highly technical reports and edit them in such a
way that they are understandable to the company’s administration and the
general public.
322
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Biochemical Development Engineer
The biochemical development engineer takes the biochemical process devel-
oped in the laboratory and scales it up through the pilot plant stage to the
full production plant. They help determine what instrumentation and equip-
ment are needed and troubleshoot problems in the scale-up procedure. They
work to develop more efficient manufacturing processes while maintaining a
high degree of quality control. They may also be involved in technological
advances from another area and apply them to their manufacturing process.
Market Research Analyst
Market research analysts analyze and research the company’s market, the
product mix, and the competition. They perform literature searches and
make presentations on technical areas and new potential markets for the
company. They predict future marketing trends based upon market research
and may even be involved in the preparation of research proposals.
Patent Attorney
A patent attorney coordinates and prepares documentation for patent appli-
cations. They track the company’s research studies and recommend the
timing of patent filings. They collect supporting documentation and negotiate
patent licenses and other legal agreements. They may become involved with
interference and appeal hearings.
Pharmaceutical Sales 
An individual with a degree in biochemistry becomes a natural for a career in
pharmaceutical sales. These sales representatives spend much of their time
on the road, talking to hospital personnel, physicians, pharmacists, and
others. They are quite familiar with their company’s products and try to be
as persuasive as possible in touting their advantages over the competition.
They have to be familiar with statistics and issues of concern in the medical
community in order to successfully communicate with potential clients.

Biostatistician
Biostatisticians are statisticians who work in health-related fields. They design
research studies and collect and analyze data on problems — such as how a
disease progresses, how safe a new treatment or medication is, or the impact
of certain risk factors associated with medical conditions. They may also
design and analyze studies to determine health care costs and health care
quality. They are instrumental in the designing stages of studies, providing
expertise on experimental design, sample sizes, and other considerations.
