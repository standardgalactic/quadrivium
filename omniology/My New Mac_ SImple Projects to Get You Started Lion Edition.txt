Dedication
This book is dedicated to everyone who has ever felt frustrated when trying to use 
a computer. Welcome to the Macintosh. Though you may still run into problems 
no matter what type of a computer you use, problems on a Macintosh will appear 
far less frequently than on any other type of a computer. Get ready—you may soon 
experience trouble-free computing. 
Acknowledgments
This book owes its life to Bill Pollock, the publisher of No Starch Press, who pretty 
much lets me write about anything I want just as long as he thinks there’s a mar-
ket for buying it. Thanks also go to Tyler Ortman for keeping this entire project 
together and to Serena Yang and Riley Hoffman for making sure everything I wrote 
actually made sense and really worked.
Thanks also go to Jack Dunning at ComputorEdge Online (http://www 
.computoredge.com/) for giving me a weekly Macintosh column where I can 
spout off about anything I want just as long as it’s not advocating the overthrow 
of the government or using language unsuitable for children’s eyes. I’d also like 
to thank all the people I’ve met during my twenty-one-year career as a stand-up 
comedian: Steve Schirripa (who appeared on HBO’s hit show The Sopranos) and 
Don Learned for giving me my first break in performing in Las Vegas at the Riviera 
Hotel & Casino, Russ Rivas, Dobie “The Uranus King” Maxwell, Chris Clobber, 
Dante, Darrell Joyce, Tony Scaduto for using me as a human prop, and Leo “The 
Man, the Myth, the Legend” Fontaine. 
I’d also like to thank my former radio comedy co-hosts during the year we 
spent on 103.7 FreeFM in San Diego: Drizz, Rick Gene, Justin Davis, and Dane 
Henderson. We may not have always known what we were doing on the air, 
but every night at the radio station was a complete blast until the radio station 
switched to an all-music format and kicked us off the air. 
Dane Henderson also deserves another round of thanks for starting up a sec-
ond, short-lived radio show where we got to talk about video games and sports on 
ESPN Radio in San Diego. Once again, we had a lot of fun without knowing what 
we were doing, but we got to meet a lot of interesting people including profes-
sional athletes who make their living trying to hurt each other for the amusement 
of everyone else. Plus we got free passes for various video game conventions.
Thanks also go to Michael Montijo for letting me be a part of his wild dream 
of creating a cartoon series called “The Adventures of Pachuko Boy” (http://www 
.pachukoboy.com/). More thanks go to Joe Polish (http://www.joepolish.com/) and 
Mike Koenigs (http://www.mikekoenigs.com/) for letting me inside their crazy world 
of marketing and entrepreneurship. 
Finally, I’d like to acknowledge my wife, Cassandra; my son, Jordan; and 
my cat, Nuit, for putting up with all my time spent sitting in front of the computer 
instead of doing anything else.

Most people don’t care how their computer 
works; they just want to use it. Tell the average 
person how to give commands to his computer’s 
“operating system” and his eyes will glaze over 
with boredom. But tell that same person how to 
have fun and do something useful with his com-
puter and his eyes will light up immediately.
That’s why this is a different kind of com-
puter book. Instead of babbling about every 
possible feature and command and then 
hoping that you’ll find an actual use for that 
information, this book teaches you how to do 
something fun and useful with your Macintosh 
right away. 
With most computers, the biggest problem 
is just getting them to work. With a Macintosh, 
the biggest problem is figuring out all the dif-
ferent ways you can put your computer to work

Introduction
for you and have fun while doing it. People often use a Macintosh for years just to 
write letters or send email and then suddenly discover that they could have also 
been using that Macintosh to organize and edit photos and home videos, watch 
DVDs, or make their own audio CDs containing their favorite songs.
The whole purpose of this book is to teach you how to get the most out of 
your Macintosh without having to buy or download anything extra. If you already 
know how to use a different type of computer, you’ll find that the Macintosh works 
in similar ways. If you’re new to computers altogether, you’ll find that the Macintosh 
can be a friendly, forgiving, and fun tool that will make you wonder why anybody 
in their right mind would ever want to use a different type of computer. No matter 
what your experience with computers may be, you’ll soon learn that the Macintosh 
comes loaded with dozens of neat programs and tools for making your life easier. 
This book won’t just teach you how to use your Macintosh; it will teach you 
how to use your Macintosh to make your life easier without having to become a 
computer expert. After all, you probably bought a Macintosh because you wanted 
a computer that works for you, not the other way around.
Understanding Computer Terms
If you’re already familiar with computers, you can skip this section. If you aren’t 
comfortable using a computer, take the time to learn some common terms that 
you’ll see in this book. Basically, using a computer involves the computer display-
ing information on the screen and waiting for you to select from a limited number 
of choices. Depending on your selection, the computer then displays new informa-
tion and waits for you to choose another option.
To use a computer, you need to know how to decipher the options the com-
puter displays and how to tell the computer what your selection is.
Telling the Computer What to Do
The two most common ways to give a command to a Macintosh are:
>
>
Pointing
>
>
Clicking
Pointing simply means moving the pointer on the screen. If you’re using a 
mouse, you can move the pointer by sliding the mouse on a flat surface. If you’re 
using a trackpad, you can move the pointer by sliding one finger on the trackpad 
surface.
The two main purposes for pointing include:
>
>
Choosing a command
>
>
Selecting something, such as text or a picture that you want to modify
Once you point to something on the screen, the computer won’t do anything 
until you click the mouse or trackpad.

Pointing and clicking are the main ways to tell the computer what to do. 
However, there are five ways you can click the mouse or trackpad:
>
>
Clicking  This means pressing the mouse button once and releasing it, or 
pressing the trackpad with one finger. Clicking often selects a command or 
moves the cursor to a new location.
>
>
Double-clicking  This means pressing the mouse button or trackpad twice 
in rapid succession. Double-clicking is most often used to select a file and 
open it.
>
>
Dragging  This means holding down the mouse button and moving the 
mouse, or pressing the trackpad down and sliding one finger across it. Drag-
ging is often used to move items from one location to another or to select 
two or more items, such as several words in a paragraph.
>
>
Clicking and holding  This means holding down the mouse button or 
pressing down on the trackpad with one finger without moving it. Clicking 
and holding on an icon on the Dock displays a menu.
>
>
Right-clicking  This means either holding down the control key and click-
ing the left mouse button, clicking the right mouse button (on a mouse that 
has two buttons), or pressing on the trackpad with two fingers at the same 
time. Right-clicking typically displays a menu of additional commands from 
which you can choose.
Table 1 lists ways of clicking, double-clicking, dragging, clicking and holding, 
and right-clicking with a mouse or a trackpad.

Introduction
Finding a Command
Your Macintosh displays lists of available commands in menus. The top of every 
Macintosh screen contains a menu bar, which organizes related commands into 
categories with names such as File, Edit, or View, as shown in Figure 1.
Q
Q Note: The menu bar always displays the name of the currently active program, 
which is the program that will accept input from the keyboard. The menu bar 
changes every time you switch to a different program, such as from iPhoto to 
the Safari web browser.
Before you use some pull-down menu commands, you may need to tell your 
Macintosh what you want to modify by pointing to and selecting an item (such as 
dragging the mouse to select several words). After you’ve selected what to modify, 
you can choose a menu command.
As an alternative to pull-down menus, you can also use pop-up menus, which 
appear when you point at an item and right-click the mouse. Pop-up menus sim-
ply display the most common commands you might use on the selected item, as 
shown in Figure 2.
When you choose some menu commands, such as Cut, your Macintosh 
immediately obeys. However, some menu commands may require more informa-
tion. For example, if you choose the Print command, your Macintosh has no idea 
which printer you want to use or how many pages you want to print. When the 
Macintosh needs more information after you choose a command, it displays a list 
of additional options in a small window called a dialog, as shown in Figure 3.
Figure 1: The menu bar at the top of the screen 
lists related commands in pull-down menus.

Figure 2: Pop-up menus display a short list of commands to modify the 
item to which the mouse currently points.
Figure 3: A dialog 
provides additional 
options to define 
how your Macintosh 
should follow a menu 
command.

6	
|	
Introduction
Dialogs often display one or more of the following options:
>
>
Radio button  Lets you choose one out of many available options
>
>
Checkbox  Lets you turn on (or off) certain options
>
>
Text box  Lets you type information, such as a number
>
>
Pop-up menu  Displays a list of valid options you can choose
>
>
Button  Displays a command you can choose by clicking it
Most dialogs also display at least two buttons. One button is labeled Cancel 
and appears white. The second is highlighted in blue and is the default button. It 
has a label specific to the dialog, such as Print, OK, or Save.
Clicking the Cancel button (or pressing the esc key) makes the dialog go 
away and tells your Macintosh, “Oops, I changed my mind and I don’t want you to 
do anything right now.” 
Clicking the blue default button (or pressing the return key) tells your Macin-
tosh, “See all the options I picked in the dialog? Use those options and obey my 
command.” 
Dragging and Dropping
One of the faster ways to perform different actions on your Macintosh is to use 
something called dragging and dropping. The idea is that you drag something on 
the screen and drop it somewhere else to perform some action. For example, you 
can drag a file and drop it over the Trash icon to delete it, drag a file over a pro-
gram icon on the Dock to open that file using that program, or select and drag text 
and drop it in a new location within a word processor document.
Dragging and dropping won’t always work, but experiment with it in differ-
ent programs because it can save you time. The basic steps to dragging and drop-
ping are as follows:
1.	
(Optional) Select the item or items you want to drag.
2.	
Move the pointer over the selected item and drag it to a new location.
3.	
Release the mouse button or trackpad to drop the item over an icon or in a 
new location.
How This Book Is Organized
To help you get started doing something useful right away with your Macin-
tosh, this book is divided into short projects that act like recipes in a cookbook. 
Each project states a common problem you may face when using a computer, 
explains how your Macintosh can help you solve that problem, and then lists all 
the steps you need to follow to solve that particular problem in a way that only a 
Macintosh can.
By teaching you how to do something fun and useful right away, using hands-
on instructions, you’ll learn how to achieve concrete results with your ­Mac­intosh. 
Think of this book as a combination tutorial and reference guide. As a tutorial, this

book can teach you how to use your Macintosh. As a reference guide, it can pro-
vide step-by-step instructions for helping you solve different problems using your 
Macintosh. 
You don’t have to follow this book in any specific order, just as you don’t have 
to follow a cookbook in any specific order. Feel free to jump around—follow along 
with the projects that show you how to do something you find useful, and skip the 
projects that you don’t care about. Nobody really needs to know everything about 
their computer to use it; you only need to know enough to be productive. By fol-
lowing the projects in this book, you just may surprise yourself with how you can 
have fun while learning to use a computer all at the same time.


Part 1
Basic Training


1
To control your Macintosh, you use the mouse 
(or trackpad if you have a laptop or optional 
Magic Trackpad). Both the mouse and the track­
pad control an arrow on your screen called a 
pointer. When you move the mouse or slide 
a fingertip across the trackpad, you move the 
pointer on the screen. The pointer lets you 
choose commands on menus, items in folders, 
the point where you want to start typing text 
in a document, and more. Think of the pointer 
as a virtual finger that tells your Macintosh what 
to select.
Project goal: Learn how to use your mouse 
or trackpad to control your Macintosh.

Use the Mouse 
and Trackpad

Chapter 1
What You’ll Be Using
To learn how to use the mouse and trackpad, you’ll use the following:
>
>
The mouse (or trackpad)
>
>
The Finder program
>
>
The Dock
How to Point and Click the Mouse and 
Trackpad
Your Macintosh always displays a menu bar at the top of the screen. To choose a 
menu to open, move your mouse to move the pointer over a menu title, such as 
File or Edit. (Try it now!) To move the pointer with a trackpad, slide your finger on 
the trackpad surface.
Once you’ve moved the pointer to point to a menu on the screen, you can 
open that menu by pressing and releasing the left mouse button or by pressing 
down on the trackpad. Pressing the left mouse button or trackpad once and 
releasing it right away is known as clicking.
Practice pointing and clicking the mouse or trackpad:
1.	
Move the pointer over 
the Apple menu in the 
upper-left corner of the 
screen.
2.	
Click the left mouse 
button (or press the 
trackpad). A pull-down 
menu appears, as shown 
in Figure 1-1.
3.	
Move the pointer up 
and down over the 
commands in the pull-
down menu. Notice that 
each time you move the 
pointer over a command, 
the command appears 
highlighted. This is the 
Macintosh’s way of ask-
ing you, “Is this the com-
mand you want to choose?”
4.	
Move the pointer anywhere away from the pull-down menu and click the

disappears. (You can also press the esc key on the keyboard to make a pull-
down menu disappear.)

Dragging the Pointer
Another common action is called dragging. Dragging the pointer occurs when you 
click, hold, and move the pointer over something on the screen. To drag with the 
mouse, hold the left mouse button down, move the mouse, and then release the 
left mouse button. To drag with the trackpad, press and hold your finger down on 
the trackpad, slide your finger across the trackpad surface, then lift your finger 
off the trackpad.
Dragging is often used to select multiple items, move or copy an item from 
one location to another, or, in many graphics programs, to draw lines on the screen 
or erase part of a picture, as shown in Figure 1-2.
Dragging can select 
multiple icons.
Dragging can move 
an object from one 
location to another.
Dragging can draw 
or erase lines in a 
picture.
Figure 1-2: Dragging performs different 
actions, depending on the program you use.

Practice dragging with the mouse or trackpad:
1.	
Move the pointer over the Finder icon on the Dock and click the left mouse 
button or press the trackpad. (From now on, this book will give this instruc-
tion in a shorter way: “Click the Finder icon on the Dock.”) The Finder win-
dow appears.
2.	
Click the Home folder icon that appears under Favorites in the sidebar (left 
pane) of the Finder window. (The Home folder displays a house icon along 
with the name of the account.) The Home folder appears highlighted, so you 
know it has been selected. Several folder icons appear in the right pane of 
the Finder window, as shown in Figure 1-3.
Q
Q Note: If the folder icons don’t look like those shown in Figure 1-3, click the 
View menu and choose as Icons (select Viewas Icons), or press the  and 1 
keys simultaneously (-1).
3.	
Move the pointer over any folder (such as the Documents folder), hold down 
the left mouse button, and move the mouse, or press down on the trackpad 
and slide your finger on the trackpad surface. (From now on, we will use a 
shorter way to give this instruction: “Drag the folder.”) Notice that as long 
as you hold down the left mouse button and move the mouse or press your 
finger on the trackpad, a “ghost image” of the folder moves on the screen.
4.	
Move the pointer to position the folder anywhere inside the right pane of 
the Finder window and then release the left mouse button or trackpad. The 
folder now appears in its new location.
Q
Q Note: When dragging the mouse, always keep the left mouse button held 
down as you’re moving the mouse. Trackpad users can hold down one finger 
and drag with a second to click-and-drag.
Figure 1-3: Clicking the Home folder icon displays the contents of 
your account, which contains all your files and programs.

Double-Clicking the Mouse and Trackpad
Double-clicking means pressing and releasing the left mouse button (or trackpad) 
twice in rapid succession. ­Double-clicking is basically a shortcut for eliminating 
multiple single clicks to select an item and then choose a menu command. For 
example, to open a file without double-clicking, you would need to follow four 
steps:
1.	
Move the pointer over the file you want to open.
2.	
Click the file to tell your Macintosh that this is the file you want to perform a 
command on.
3.	
Click the File menu title. A pull-down menu appears.
4.	
Click the Open command. (From now on, this book will explain how to 
choose a menu title and a command by using the shorter description 
“Select FileOpen.”)
Rather than click three different times, you could open a file just by 
double-clicking:
1.	
Move the pointer over the file you want to open.
2.	
Double-click the file to tell your Macintosh that you want to open it.
Right-Clicking the Mouse
Most mice have a left and right button, which perform different tasks. To mimic 
pressing the right mouse button on a trackpad, tap the trackpad with two fingers. 
(If you have an older laptop with a trackpad button, hold down the control key, 
press the trackpad button, and then release both.)
When you point at something on the screen and right-click, a menu called a 
shortcut menu pops up on the screen. This shortcut menu provides a list of com-
mands from which you can choose.
Here’s how right-clicking works:
1.	
Move the pointer over any icon that appears on the Dock.
2.	
Press and release the right mouse button (or press two fingers down on the 
trackpad and release). A shortcut menu appears, as shown in Figure 1-4.
3.	
Move the pointer away from the shortcut menu and click the left mouse but-
ton or press one finger on the trackpad. The shortcut menu disappears. (You 
can also press the esc key to make the shortcut menu disappear.)
Figure 1-4: A shortcut menu appears when you right-click an item.

Using the Scroll Ball
By rolling the scroll ball (or a scroll wheel), you can quickly move the contents of a 
window up and down or left and right. If you’re not using Apple’s Magic Mouse, 
you may only be able to scroll up and down.
Q
Q Note: Laptop trackpads do not have a scroll ball. To simulate scrolling with a 
trackpad on a new Mac laptop, press two fingertips on the trackpad and slide 
both fingers up/down or left/right. You can also scroll by holding one finger-
tip still and sliding a second fingertip up/down or left/right.
Here’s how scrolling works:
1.	
Click the Finder icon on the Dock. The Finder window appears.
2.	
Click Applications in the sidebar of the Finder window. The contents of the 
Applications folder appear in the right pane of the Finder window.
3.	
Roll the scroll ball up and down. Notice as you scroll that the contents of the 
Finder window move up and down.
Q
Q Note: If you were surprised by the direction the icons moved, you can reverse 
your scroll directions. Just click System Preferences on the Dock, then Mouse, 
and then uncheck the box that reads “Move content in the direction of finger 
movement.”
Additional Ideas for Using the Mouse and 
Trackpad
Since the mouse (or trackpad) is the primary way to control your Macintosh, you 
need to know the two most important uses for the mouse:
>
>
Point  Move the pointer by moving the mouse or sliding your finger on the 
trackpad.
>
>
Click  Press the left mouse button or trackpad once and let go.
Start out by pointing and clicking, and when you get comfortable using 
your Macintosh and mouse, experiment with double-clicking, dragging, and right-­
clicking. If you’re worried about messing something up, practice double-clicking, 
dragging, and right-clicking on a Macintosh in a store or on someone else’s Macin-
tosh. That way, if you really mess things up, you can walk away and pretend you 
don’t know what happened.
Q
Q Note: If you use a laptop, remember that you can still use a mouse simply 
by plugging one into your computer. You’ll then have the choice of using the 
mouse or the trackpad to control your Macintosh. A spare mouse can be very 
handy.

If you have a laptop Macintosh (or a Magic 
Trackpad), you can control your computer using 
finger gestures on the trackpad surface. Even if 
you’ve used a trackpad before, you may be sur-
prised by how your Mac’s trackpad behaves—
that’s because it can tell how many fingers are 
on its surface. Apple calls this technology Multi-
touch—if you’ve ever used an iPad or an iPhone 
you may find it familiar. Let’s try it out. 
Project goal: Learn how to use your Mac’s 
trackpad, customize it, and disable the features 
you don’t need (or like).

What You’ll Be Using
To learn how to use finger gestures to control a Macintosh, you’ll use the following:
>
>
A trackpad (either built-in or the 
Magic Trackpad)
>
>
An Internet Connection 
>
>
The System Preferences program
>
>
The Safari web browser
Q
Q NOTE: If you have only a Magic Mouse, skip ahead to “Using Finger Gestures 
with the Magic Mouse” on page 25 to learn its touch gestures.
Using the Trackpad
It takes some time to get used to the trackpad. But you may find it’s easier to use 
than a mouse after a little practice. Let’s try out the most common gestures on a 
web page in Safari, Apple’s web browser. 
1.	
Drag a single finger on the trackpad until it is right over the Safari icon on 
the Dock.
2.	
Press down until you feel a click and then let go (this is equivalent to clicking 
with a mouse). The Safari web browser appears.
3.	
Drag a single finger until your cursor is over the Address bar and click again. 
Type a newspaper’s website like nytimes.com or wjs.com, then press enter. 
The page loads on your screen, as shown in Figure 2-1.
Figure 2-1: Safari supports most of the trackpad’s finger gestures.
Click here 
and then type 
a website’s 
address.

4.	
Put two fingers on the trackpad and try moving them up and down. The 
page scrolls up and down. (This same gesture works side-to-side too!)
5.	
Put two fingers on the trackpad and pinch outward—the text zooms in. 
Reverse the gesture to zoom back out.
6.	
Find the headline of an article you’d like to read and then press down the 
trackpad with two fingers (this is the same as right-clicking). A context win-
dow pops up.
7.	
Choose Open in New Window. A new Safari window appears with your 
article. Try scrolling up and down with two fingers again. 
8.	
Double-tap on the trackpad with two fingers (without clicking). Your screen 
perfectly zooms into a column of text, as shown on the left of Figure 2-2. 
9.	
Find some text that you want to select. Press down on the trackpad and 
hold it—with the trackpad depressed, move your finger up and down. You’re 
clicking-and-dragging to select text. You can also press one finger down, 
and move a second up and down to click and drag. 
10.	
Click a new headline to read, and a new article appears. Swipe to the left 
with two fingers, and the previous story appears, as shown in Figure 2-3. You 
just moved back. Swipe to the right to move forward.
Now that you’ve seen the basics in action, let’s see how to change their 
behavior to suit your preferences.
Figure 2-2: When viewing a web page, double-tap on the trackpad with two fingers to per-
fectly zoom in on a column of text, no matter the size.

Chapter 2
Customizing the Trackpad
For maximum flexibility, you can selectively turn on or off different finger gestures. 
To customize your trackpad, follow these steps:
1.	
Click the Apple menu and choose System Preferences. The System Prefer-
ences window appears. (Alternatively, click the System Preferences icon on 
the Dock.)
2.	
Click the Trackpad icon that appears in the Hardware category. The Track-
pad window appears, as shown in Figure 2-4.
3.	
Change the settings under the Point & Click, Scroll & Zoom, and More Ges-
tures tabs so the trackpad will behave the way you want it to. (See the follow-
ing sections for details on these settings.)
Q
Q NOTE: Depending on your hardware, certain touch gestures may not be 
available.
Figure 2-3: Swiping with two fingers lets you move quickly back-and-forth 
through your browsing history. This gesture won't work in all apps.

Point and Click Gestures
The Trackpad window starts by allowing you to customize Point and Click gestures. 
You can enable or disable four features:
>
>
Tap to click  This feature lets you touch the trackpad surface to click—that 
is, instead of actually depressing the trackpad itself. This is the handiest 
feature to enable—it’s a boon for those with limited hand strength. 
>
>
Secondary click  This lets you press two fingers down on the trackpad to 
represent the right-click on a mouse. If you turn off this Secondary click fea-
ture, you’ll need to right-click by holding down the control key and pressing 
one finger down on the trackpad. 
>
>
Look up  This lets you double-tap with three fingers on the trackpad while 
pointing at a word. This displays a dictionary definition of that word along 
with a list of synonyms and antonyms. Unless you plan to spend a lot of time 
in the dictionary, you can safely turn this feature off. 
Figure 2-4: The Trackpad window lets you turn the different finger 
gestures on and off and adjust the Tracking Speed. If you’re confused 
by Apple’s text descriptions of the touch gestures, just watch the vid-
eos that accompany each description.
Tap here and here to tweak more settings.

>
Three finger drag  This is a great feature to enable for those who hate 
clicking-and-dragging on the trackpad. Just hold three fingers on the track­
pad and you can move windows, drag icons, and more without having to click 
the trackpad. (If you enable this feature, you may need to change some of the 
gestures in the More Gestures tab to be four- instead of three-fingered.)
You can also adjust the Tracking Speed at the bottom of the screen (see 
Figure 2-4). 
Scroll and Zoom Gestures
The Scroll & Zoom tab displays various two-finger gestures for moving through a 
document or manipulating an item on the screen, as shown in Figure 2-5. 
>
>
Scroll direction: natural  This feature lets you slide two fingers vertically or 
horizontally to scroll a document inside a window. Scroll up and the contents 
of the window slide up. Scroll down and the contents slide down. 
When this option is turned off, scrolling behaves like in older versions 
of Mac OS X where scrolling up slides the window contents down and scroll-
ing down slides the window contents up. This seemingly backwards behavior 
stems from mimicking the movement of scroll bars where scrolling the scroll 
box up slides the window content down and scrolling the scroll box down 
slides the window content up. 
Figure 2-5: The Scroll & Zoom trackpad options

>
>
Zoom in or out  This lets you pinch two fingertips in or out across the 
trackpad surface to enlarge or shrink an image on the screen.
>
>
Smart zoom  This lets you tap (not press down to click) two fingers on 
the trackpad to make an image or content expand to fill the entire size of 
the window. This is very handy for reading long articles, or zooming into a 
document. 
>
>
Rotate  This lets you hold two fingertips apart and spin your hand in a cir-
cular motion to rotate an item on the screen. Rotate is especially handy for 
manipulating images such as digital photographs—this gesture doesn’t work 
in all apps, though.
More Gestures
The More Gestures tab displays various two-, three-, and four-finger gestures for 
accessing features such as Mission Control or Launchpad, as shown in Figure 2-6. 
>
>
Swipe between pages  This feature lets you slide two fingers horizontally 
across the trackpad to view content in programs such as Safari or Preview. 
By clicking the downward-pointing arrow underneath this option, you can 
define whether to use two or three fingers for this gesture.

>
Swipe between full-screen apps  This lets you slide three fingers horizon-
tally to view multiple full-screen apps. By clicking the downward-pointing 
arrow underneath this option, you can define whether to use three or four 
fingers for this gesture.
>
>
Mission Control  This lets you slide three fingers up to display Mission 
Control, which displays thumbnail images of your currently open windows 
and virtual desktops (see Chapter 7). By clicking the downward-pointing 
arrow underneath this option, you can define whether to use three or four 
fingers for this gesture.
>
>
App Exposé  This lets you slide three fingers down to display multiple win-
dows of the currently active program as thumbnail images. If you edit a lot of 
documents or photos at once, this is a great way to quickly switch between 
them. By clicking the downward-pointing arrow underneath this option, you 
can define whether to use three or four fingers for this gesture.
>
>
Launchpad  This lets you pinch with your thumb and three fingers to display 
the Launchpad screen. You’ll learn all about Launchpad in Chapter 8.
>
>
Show Desktop  This lets you spread your thumb and three fingers to dis-
play the desktop.
Using all the shortcuts at once can be confusing, so feel free to disable the 
ones you’ll never use. Check out Figure 2-7 for a reminder of what everything does.

Using Finger Gestures with the Magic Mouse
If you have a Magic Mouse, you have a touch surface on the top of the mouse. 
While not as versatile as the Magic Trackpad or the built-in trackpad on laptops, 
the Magic Mouse lets you perform a limited number of gestures that closely 
mimic the trackpad:
>
>
Scroll  Slide one finger vertically or horizontally across the Magic Mouse 
surface.
>
>
Smart Zoom  Double-tap (not click) the top of the Magic Mouse with one 
finger.
>
>
Swipe between pages  Swipe two fingers horizontally across the surface of 
the Magic Mouse.
>
>
Swipe between full-screen apps  Slide two fingers horizontally across the 
surface of the Magic Mouse.
The Magic Mouse is best for people who like the familiarity of a mouse, while 
the Magic Trackpad is best for those who prefer using multi-finger gestures on 
a desktop Macintosh. Of course, you can always use both a Magic Mouse and a 
Magic Trackpad to get the advantages of each device.
Additional Ideas for Using Finger Gestures
You’ll probably need to experiment a bit to find the right settings for your track-
pad. Customizing the trackpad lets you choose the finger gestures you want to 
use most often while turning off those gestures you don’t need. Examine your 
favorite programs that you use most often and see how finger gestures can make 
your favorite program easier to use. You may be surprised how much faster you can 
accomplish tasks just by using your fingers.

Using a computer can be like having a conver-
sation. The computer starts off by asking you 
what you want to do. After deciphering the 
options the computer offers, you tell it what to 
do next. The computer follows your command 
and then asks what you want to do now, and 
so on.
To use a Macintosh, you must first under-
stand the choices that are provided to you. 
Then you must tell your Macintosh what to do 
based on those choices.
You use the mouse, trackpad, and keyboard 
to respond to information that is displayed on 
the screen to communicate with and control 
your Macintosh. That might mean clicking a 
menu and selecting a command, or clicking 
icons or buttons.
Choosing 
Commands on 
the Menu Bar

Chapter 3
Since your Macintosh organizes most commands in menus, you first need to 
know how to find and use the commands stored in the menu bar, which appears at 
the top of the screen.
Project goal: Learn to choose commands from the menu bar to control your 
Macintosh.
What You’ll Be Using
To learn how to communicate with the Macintosh user interface, you’ll use the

The keyboard
Understanding the Menu Bar
When you visit a restaurant, the waiter hands you a menu. Likewise, when you turn 
on your Macintosh and run an application, it offers you menus of commands in its 
menu bar. But unlike that restaurant menu, you can select only one item at a time, 
and you must decide which menu to access to select the item you want.
The menu bar always appears at the top of the screen—it only offers com-
mands for the program you have in front of you. Because the menu bar doesn’t 
have enough room to display every command on the screen at once, it organizes 
related commands into categories, called menu titles. Two commonly used menu 
titles are File and Edit.
The File menu lists commands you use when working with files. Nearly every 
program creates files to store data on your Macintosh. A file can be a word pro-
cessor document, a picture, or a spreadsheet of your budget. Typical commands 
found on the File menu let you open or print data stored in a file. The Edit menu 
contains commands for modifying data, such as copying or deleting.
To keep your screen from getting cluttered, the menu bar hides the list of 
available commands until you click a menu title. A menu typically displays three 
types of commands, as shown in Figure 3-1:
>
>
Commands
>
>
Submenu commands
>
>
Ellipsis commands
Commands appear as a word or series of words, such as Get Info or New 
Folder. To select a command, just point to it and click. When you select a com-
mand from a menu, your Macintosh does something in response.
Most commands can also be accessed using keyboard shortcuts, which are 
displayed on the right edge of a menu, using symbols to represent different keys 
on the keyboard (see Table 3-1). To choose a command like Open, you could press 
the Command key () and the O key at the same time. 
Most keyboard shortcuts require pressing down two or more keys at the 
same time. By memorizing these keyboard shortcuts, you can choose common

commands without the hassle of using the menus. However, not all commands 
offer keyboard shortcuts. If you don’t see any keystrokes listed to the right of a 
command in a menu, that particular command doesn’t have a keyboard shortcut.

Submenu commands always appear as a descriptive word or phrase with a 
triangle pointing to the right. To open a submenu, place your mouse over the com-
mand and wait for the submenu to pop up, as shown in Figure 3-2. This submenu 
lists additional commands from which you can choose.

Chapter 3
Ellipsis commands appear as a word or phrase followed by an ellipsis ( ... ). To 
select an ellipsis command, place your mouse over the ellipsis command and click. 
After you click the mouse, you’ll see a box with additional options, called a dialog. 
You use dialogs to give your Macintosh more information so it can complete some 
particular task. For example, as you’re working on a new file in an application, if 
you select Save (a common ellipsis command) from the File menu, a Save dialog 
pops up, asking you to type a name for the file, as shown in Figure 3-3.
Figure 3-2: Submenus always list additional commands from 
which you can choose.
Figure 3-3: Choosing an ellipsis command always displays a dialog.

One of the most important commands for any program is Quit, which exits 
or closes the program when you select it. Quit always appears in the application 
menu (the menu with the name of the application you’re currently using, such as 
iPhoto or Safari).
Understanding Dialogs
A dialog typically contains one or more of the following items, as shown in 
Figure 3-4:

>
Buttons
>
>
Text boxes
>
>
Pop-up menus
Buttons can be clicked to open another dialog or to perform a single action. 
If a dialog displays multiple buttons, one button may be highlighted to identify it 
as the default button. To choose the command displayed by a default button, you 
can either click the button with your mouse or press the return key on your key-
board. If you decide not to perform any action, you can click the Cancel button or 
press the esc key.
Figure 3-4: Common parts of a dialog; note 
that the default button here is the Print 
button, which is highlighted.

Text boxes provide a space for you to type information, such as the number 
of copies or page numbers to print.
Pop-up menus provide a fixed list of possible options from which you can 
choose, as shown in Figure 3-5. 
A dialog may appear condensed or expanded. A condensed dialog shows 
you the basic options available, and an expanded dialog lets you choose addi-
tional options. To condense or expand a dialog, click the Expand or Collapse but-
ton, as shown in Figure 3-6.

Understanding the Parts of the Menu Bar
The menu bar consists of three separate parts, as shown in Figure 3-7:
>
>
The Apple menu
>
>
The Application menu
>
>
Menulets
The Apple menu always 
appears on the left edge of the 
menu bar. It displays commands 
that provide information, let you 
customize Macintosh settings, 
or let you shut down your Macin-
tosh, as shown in Figure 3-8.
The application menu con-
sists of the name of the currently 
running program along with 
menus that contain commands 
used for that program.
No matter how many 
programs you may have running, 
only one menu bar appears at a 
time on the Macintosh. (If you’re 
familiar with the Microsoft Win-
dows user interface, you're used 
to every program window displaying its own menu bar.)
When two or more programs are running on your Macintosh, the applica-
tion menu will show commands only for the active program (or application)—the 
program you’re working with at that particular time. For example, when you’re 
using Safari, the application menu displays Safari on the menu bar next to the 
Apple menu. If you’re using iCal, the application menu displays iCal. If you’re using 
Keynote, the application menu displays Keynote. Figure 3-9 shows these sample 
menu bars.

Chapter 3
Menulets are little menus designed for controlling a single part of your 
Macintosh, such as the clock, the volume of your speakers, or battery and energy 
settings. They appear on 
the far right of the menu 
bar and typically contain 
simple menus or sliders 
that control different 
parts of your Macintosh, 
as shown in Figure 3-10. 
Since menulets are meant 
to give you one-click 
access to controlling 
important parts of your 
Macintosh, they always 
appear on the menu bar, 
no matter which pro-
gram may be running. 
Using the Keyboard
Most of the time, you’ll use the mouse or trackpad to control your Macintosh and 
use your keyboard to type numbers and letters. However, you can also use the key-
board to use pull-down menus. This can be handy in case your mouse isn’t working 
or you don’t want to take your fingers away from the keyboard. 
To access the pull-down menus with the keyboard, follow these steps:
1.	
Press control-F2. (Hold down the control key, press the F2 key, and then let 
go of both keys). This highlights the Apple menu.
2.	
Press the left and right arrow keys to highlight a different menu title, such as 
File or Edit.
3.	
Press the down arrow key or return to view a pull-down menu. 
4.	
Press the up and down arrow keys to highlight a command on a pull- 
down menu.
5.	
Press return to choose a command (or press esc to exit out of the pull-down 
menus without choosing anything).
Once you understand the basics for using the mouse and keyboard, you’re 
ready to start using your Macintosh.
Additional Ideas for Using the Menu Bar
The menu bar gives you easy access to the commands you can use to control a 
program. The first time you use a program, browse through its menus to see how 
commands are grouped. Commands should be grouped logically to make them 
easy to find. For example, the Macintosh’s Window menu contains commands for 
manipulating multiple windows on the screen, while the Edit menu contains com-
mands for copying or pasting items.
Figure 3-10: Menulets appear on the menu bar 
to give you quick access to common features of 
your Macintosh.

The menu bar is also useful for identifying the active program. When you 
have multiple applications running and you’re not sure which application the com-
mands on the menu bar will affect, look for the name of the program next to the 
Apple menu.
Normally, the menu bar appears translucent, which means you can see part 
of the background image through the menu bar. You can change this setting by 
doing the following:
1.	
Click the Apple menu and choose System Preferences. The System Prefer­
ences window appears.
2.	
Click the Desktop & Screen Saver icon. The Desktop & Screen Saver win-
dow appears.
3.	
Click the Desktop tab.
4.	
Select or clear the Translucent Menu Bar checkbox, as shown in Figure 3-11.
5.	
Click the close button of the Desktop & Screen Saver window.
By understanding the different parts and purposes of the menu bar, you’ll 
always be able to control your Macintosh. Now you just have to figure out what you 
want to make it do.

The point of owning a computer is to be able 
to run programs that make the computer do 
something useful or fun. The programs you 
run determine what your computer can do. 
If you want to write letters or balance your 
budget, you can run a word processor or a 
spreadsheet program. If you want to do some-
thing a bit more fun, you can run astrology 
programs, horse-handicapping programs, or 
lottery-­number-choosing programs. With the 
right program, you can make your Macintosh 
do practically anything that doesn’t involve 
manual labor. 
All the programs on your Macintosh are 
stored in the Applications folder. However, to 
make it easy to find and run programs, you

can store your favorite and most frequently used programs on the Dock—the line 
of icons at the bottom of your screen. The Dock offers a convenient way to find, 
run, switch between, and shut down programs. 
Project goal: Learn to use the Dock to run, switch, and quit programs on 
your Macintosh. 
What You’ll Be Using
To learn how to run programs through the Dock, you’ll use the following:

Understanding Program Icons
Every Macintosh program appears as an icon in the Applications folder on your 
hard disk. To run any program installed on your Macintosh, you must first find its 
icon. The most straightforward way to find a program icon is to look inside the 
Applications folder. 
A faster way to load a program is to place that program’s icon on the Dock so 
it’s within sight at all times. The Dock’s main purpose is to provide a place where 
you can find your most frequently used program icons without digging through the 
Applications folder. Table 4-1 shows the main differences between starting a pro-
gram from the Applications folder and starting a program from the Dock.

Q NOTE: If you don’t see a glowing blue dot under the icon of a running program, 
make sure this option is turned on: In the System Preferences window, click 
the Dock icon and select Show indicator lights for open applications.
Starting a Program Through the Dock
The Dock displays the icons of your most frequently used programs so you’ll have 
one‑click access to those programs. Initially, the Dock contains several icons, but 
you can always delete them or add others (see Chapter 5 to learn how to custom-
ize the Dock).
To see how to start a program from the Dock, do this:
1.	
Move the pointer over the Safari icon on the Dock. Notice that when you 
move the mouse pointer over an icon on the Dock, the program name 
appears over that icon.
2.	
Click the Safari icon to load the Safari program. Notice that you only need to 
single-click an icon displayed on the Dock. The Safari window appears.
3.	
Select SafariQuit or press -Q. The Safari window disappears, but the 
Safari program icon remains on the Dock.
Switching Programs and Windows from 
the Dock
Besides letting you run programs, the Dock also lets you switch programs simply 
by clicking the icon on the Dock that represents the program you want to use. For 
example, to switch between iTunes and iPhoto, click the iTunes icon on the Dock 
and the iTunes window appears. Click the iPhoto icon on the Dock and the iPhoto 
window appears.
Many programs allow you to open multiple windows at once, such as Safari 
displaying two or more web pages in separate windows. To switch between mul-
tiple windows opened by the same program, you can use menus or thumbnails.
To see how to switch between different programs and program windows 
using menus and thumbnail images, do this:
1.	
Click the Finder icon on the Dock. A Finder window appears.
2.	
Click the Safari icon on the Dock. The Safari window appears. 
3.	
Click in the Address text field, type www.apple.com, and press return. The 
Apple website appears.
4.	
Click the Finder icon on the Dock. Notice that the Finder window appears 
over the Safari window and the Finder menu appears to the right of the 
Apple menu on the menu bar at the top of the screen.
5.	
Click the Safari icon on the Dock. Notice that the Safari window now 
appears over the Finder window and the Safari menu appears to the right 
of the Apple menu on the menu bar.

and switch between programs, but it can 
also help you quit programs, as shown in 
Figure 4-4. There are four common ways 
to quit a program:
>
>
Click the program name (such as 
Safari or iTunes) on the menu bar 
and choose Quit.

Accessing the Documents and Downloads 
Folders on the Dock
Initially the Dock contains two folders (Documents and Downloads) that appear 
to the right of the white, dotted dividing line near the right side of the Dock. 
The Documents folder is meant to store all the files you’ve created using other 
programs, such as a word processor. The Downloads folder contains files you’ve 
downloaded off the Internet. 
To access the Documents or Downloads folders, you could click the Finder 
icon on the Dock and then search for the Documents or Downloads folders inside 
the Finder window. However, this can be confusing and tedious. A faster method is 
to access the Documents or Downloads folders directly from the Dock.
Browsing Through the Documents Folder
When you click the Documents folder on the Dock, a list of all its files and folders 
appears, which you can scroll through, as shown in Figure 4-5. 
Q
Q Note: Your Documents folder will contain different file and folder names than 
what you see in Figure 4-5.
If you click a file, you’ll open it. If you click a folder, you’ll see the files and 
folders contained within.
Figure 4-5: Clicking the Documents folder on the Dock shows its contents.

The Downloads folder contains all the files you’ve downloaded off the Internet. 
To view the contents of the Downloads folder, do this:
>
>
Click the Downloads folder on the Dock. A list of all files stored in the Down-
loads folder appears, as shown in Figure 4-6. (If the number of files stored in 
the Downloads folder is six or less, clicking the Downloads folder displays a 
curved fan list of filenames. If the number of files stored is seven or greater, 
the list of files appears in a grid.)

>
Click the Open in Finder icon (which looks like a curved arrow inside a 
­circle). The Downloads window appears.
Q
Q Note: If you want to see more (or less) of your Applications, Downloads, or 
Documents folders on the Dock, you can customize how they appear. Right-
click the icon on the Dock, and choose View Content as Fan, Grid, or List, 
depending on your preference.

Additional Ideas for Using the Dock
The Dock acts like a shortcut, sparing you from using the Finder every time you 
want to run a program or open a file. In addition, the Dock also comes in handy for 
switching between programs and program windows, and quitting programs from 
one convenient location:
>
>
Loading and switching programs  Click an icon on the Dock.
>
>
Switching to a different open file  Right-click an icon on the Dock and 
click a filename.
>
>
Shutting down a program  Right-click an icon on the Dock and choose Quit.
The more comfortable and familiar you get with the Dock, the easier it will 
be to use your Macintosh, no matter what you want to do, so take a few moments 
to practice using the Dock. 

5
The Dock is a handy place for running pro-
grams. But the Dock likely contains icons for 
programs that you never use, so you may want 
to remove those icons and replace them with 
icons of your favorite programs. In addition, you 
may want to rearrange the icons on the Dock 
so similar programs are grouped together, such 
as grouping all Internet programs in one part of 
the Dock.
Besides changing the programs that appear 
on the Dock, you can also rearrange the posi-
tion of the Dock on the screen or the size of the 
icons on the Dock itself. Finally, you can store 
your own files and folders on the Dock to give 
you one-click access to the files or folders you 
need most often.

Showing (or Hiding) Indicator Lights on 
the Dock
In previous versions of Mac OS X, a tiny blue dot would appear underneath the 
icon of every program on the Dock that was currently running. In Mac OS X 10.7 
Lion, you now have a choice of turning these indicator lights on or off. 
To turn indicator lights on or off, do this:

Adding and Removing Icons on the Dock
The Dock contains icons for common programs you’re most likely to use, such as 
Safari and iTunes. However, there’s a good chance that the Dock currently contains 
icons that you’ll rarely use, while it does not contain icons of programs that you do 
use often. 
To fix this problem, you can add new program icons to the Dock and remove 
icons of programs that you don’t need. There are two ways to add a program icon 
to the Dock:
>
>
Drag a program icon from the Finder window to the Dock.
>
>
Open a program, right-click its icon, and then choose Options4Keep 
in Dock.
Dragging an Icon to the Dock
The most straightforward way to place a new icon on the Dock is to drag it from 
the Finder window to the Dock by doing this:
1.	
Click the Finder icon on the Dock. The Finder window appears.
2.	
Click the Applications folder icon in the sidebar of the Finder window. The 
right pane of the Finder window displays icons for all the programs installed 
on your Macintosh.

Removing an Icon from the Dock by Dragging
Just as you can add an icon to the Dock by dragging it from the Finder window to 
the Dock, you can also remove an icon by dragging it off the Dock and dropping it 
anywhere away from the Dock, as shown in Figure 5-8.
To remove a program icon from the Dock by dragging it, do this:
1.	
Move the mouse pointer over an icon on the Dock that you no longer want, 
such as the Calculator icon.
2.	
Drag the program icon away from the Dock.
3.	
Release the mouse button. Your program icon disappears in an animated 
puff of smoke.
Q
Q Note: Removing a program icon from the Dock does not delete the program 
from your computer; you can still find its program icon in the Applications 
folder using the Finder.
Choosing the Remove from Dock Command
Another way to remove an icon from the Dock is to right-click the icon and then 
choose the Remove from Dock command. To see how this works, do this:
1.	
Right-click a program icon 
on the Dock that you want to 
remove, such as the Calculator 
or Address Book icon. A pop-up

Adding and Removing Files and Folders on 
the Dock
If you have files or folders that you frequently use, you can store them on the right 
side of the Dock (right of the white dividing line) near the Trash icon. 
Adding a File or Folder to the Dock
You can add any file or folder to the Dock for one-click access to that file or folder. 
To add a file or folder to the Dock, do this:
1.	
Click the Finder icon on the Dock. The Finder window appears.
2.	
(Optional) Double-click the folder icons in the right pane of the Finder win-
dow to navigate to a different folder.
3.	
Drag a file or folder from the Finder window to the right side of the Dock. 
Your file or folder now appears on the Dock. If you click a file icon on the Dock, 
you’ll open that file and load the program that created that file. If you click a 
folder icon on the Dock, you’ll see a list of file icons stored in that folder. 
Q
Q Note: Dragging a file or folder from the Finder window to the Dock does not 
delete that file or folder from its location.
Removing a File or Folder from the Dock
If you’ve added a file or folder to the Dock, you can always remove it by doing this:
1.	
Move the mouse pointer over the file or folder icon that you want to remove 
from the Dock.
2.	
Drag the icon away from the Dock.
3.	
Release the mouse button. Your file or folder icon disappears in an animated 
puff of smoke.
Q
Q Note: Removing a file or folder icon from the Dock does not erase that file or 
folder. It is still located in the folder you dragged it from originally.
Additional Ideas for Customizing the Dock
By changing the size of the Dock and turning on magnification, you can make 
the Dock easier to see, which can be handy if you have trouble seeing all the 
icons stored on the Dock. If you don’t like other people using your computer 
when you’re away, move the Dock to the left or right side of the screen and turn 
on hiding. Unless someone knows to move the mouse pointer to the left or right 
of the screen, they won’t be able to find the Dock, which can keep them from run-
ning programs (unless they know how to start the Finder program without using 
the Dock). 

54

Chapter 5
Since the Dock contains lots of icons, take a moment to remove the ones you 
don’t want and add new icons for programs that you need on a regular basis. Then 
consider dragging a file or folder to the Dock as well for quick access to that file or 
folder.
By customizing the Dock, you can make the Dock display your favorite pro-
grams so you can work more efficiently. Just remember that the more icons you 
store on the Dock, the smaller each icon must appear to show the entire Dock.

Monitors keep getting bigger and bigger, yet 
they can still seem cluttered with menu bars 
and icons getting in the way. If you want to 
eliminate these visual distractions so you can 
focus, you’ll appreciate the new full-screen 
viewing feature, which lets you expand a win-
dow to fill your entire monitor.
Just keep in mind that programs must be 
specifically designed to work with OS X Lion in 
order to use full-screen mode, so there’s a good 
chance any older programs you have won’t sup-
port this feature. However, newer Mac OS X 
programs will probably take advantage of this 
feature in future updates, so you are likely to 
enjoy full-screen viewing of your favorite pro-
grams in the near future.

Additional Ideas for Using Full-Screen 
Viewing
Running applications at full screen is a great way to focus and avoid distractions. If 
you have more than one full-screen app running, you can quickly switch between 
them by swiping three fingers across the the trackpad (also customizable to a four-
fingered swipe; see Chapter 2). If your favorite app doesn’t support full screen 
viewing yet, don’t forget that you can just resize the window by dragging on any 
corner.

If you’re like a lot of Mac users, you like to do a 
lot of things at once. No matter how big your 
screen may be, it can still feel crowded as you 
open and arrange multiple windows on the 
desktop. The solution to the problem? Mission 
Control. 
The idea behind Mission Control is to show 
what you’re running all at once. It allows you 
to quickly swap programs. In addition, Mission 
Control lets you create multiple virtual desktops 
(called Spaces) that you can display one at a 
time. By storing one or more program windows 
in a single space, you can keep open windows 
organized without cluttering up a single screen. 
When you want to view another window, just 
switch to a different virtual desktop. 
Project goal: Learn to use Mission Control 
to create and manage virtual desktops (Spaces).

What You’ll Be Using
To learn how to switch through multiple virtual desktops (Spaces) on your 
­Macintosh using Mission Control, you’ll use the following:
>
>
Mission Control
>
>
The Safari web browser
>
>
The Finder program
Starting Mission Control
Initially, your Macintosh displays a single desktop, which is what you see when you 
start up your Macintosh. When you want to create additional virtual desktops, or 
Spaces, you’ll need to start Mission Control. There are three ways to start Mission 
Control:
>
>
Start Mission Control from the Applications folder or Dock.
>
>
Press F9.
>
>
Slide three fingers up on the trackpad.
No matter how you start Mission Control, it displays your Spaces at the top 
of the screen and the current desktop in the main part of the screen, as shown in 
Figure 7-1.

4.	
You can now see your Finder window and your Safari window. No matter how 
many different windows you have, you can see them all and choose which 
one to open at a glance (see Figure 7-1). Multiple windows of the same appli-
cation show up as a stack of windows. Just click the one you want. 
5.	
(Optional) If you want to return to what you were doing before, exit out of 
Mission Control by pressing F9 or sliding three fingers down on the trackpad.
Creating Additional Virtual Desktops 
(Spaces)
Switching between applications can be handy, but you may prefer creating virtual 
desktops so you can organize multiple program windows. 
When you create multiple Spaces, you can switch between them and even 
move windows from one desktop to another. You always have at least one Space 
named Desktop. Any additional Spaces you create get named Desktop 2, Desk-
top 3, and so on.
To see how to create virtual desktops, follow these steps:
1.	
Click the Finder icon on the Dock. The Finder window appears.
2.	
Click the Safari icon on the Dock. The Safari window appears.
3.	
Open Mission Control. The Mission Control screen appears, displaying your 
two open windows on the same desktop, as shown in Figure 7-2.
4.	
Move the mouse pointer over the Finder or Safari window. Notice that when 
the mouse pointer appears over a window, that window appears highlighted.

images of the windows that are open on that desktop. 
7.	
Move the mouse pointer over the Safari window and drag and drop it over 
the Desktop 2 Space at the top of the screen. Notice that the Safari window 
now appears on Desktop 2, your second virtual desktop.
8.	
Click the Desktop 1 thumbnail at the top of the Mission Control screen. 
Desktop 1 fills the screen, containing the Finder window.
9.	
Press control-left/right arrow to view Desktop 2, which contains the Safari 
window. 
10.	
Try swapping back to Finder by starting Mission Control and then clicking on 
your first Space. You can see that Mission Control only shows the windows 
you have running on the active Space.
Q
Q Note: You can also use Mission Control to quickly switch to your Dashboard. 
You’ll learn more about the Dashboard in Chapter 18.

Chapter 7
Removing a Virtual Desktop (Space)
You can create as many Spaces as you wish. However, the more Spaces you create, 
the clumsier it can get trying to remember which program windows are open on 
which desktop. Eventually, you may want to remove a Space. 
To see how to remove a virtual desktop, do this:
1.	
Follow the instructions in the previous section to create two Spaces, where 
one desktop contains a Finder window and the second desktop contains a 
Safari window.
2.	
Open Mission Control. The Mission Control screen appears, displaying your 
two thumbnail images of desktops at the top of the screen.
3.	
Move the mouse over the Desktop 2 thumbnail image. A black and white 
close button appears in the upper-left corner of the Desktop 2 thumbnail 
image, as shown in Figure 7-5.
4.	
Click the close button that appears in the upper-left corner of Desktop 2. 
Note that Safari doesn’t close! Your Macintosh automatically moves the 
Safari window from Desktop 2 back to Desktop 1.
Customizing the Mission Control Hotkey
By default, Mac OS X 10.7 Lion uses the F9 function key to load Mission Control. 
If you want, you can choose a different function key to load Mission Control. To 
define a new Mission Control hotkey, do this:
1.	
Click the Apple menu and choose System Preferences. The System Prefer-
ences window appears.
2.	
Click the Mission Control icon under the Personal category. A Mission Con-
trol window appears, as shown in Figure 7-6.
3.	
Click the Mission Control pop-up menu underneath the Keyboard and 
Mouse Shortcuts category. A list of different hotkeys appears, as shown in 
Figure 7-7.
4.	
Click a hotkey and then click the close button to make the Mission Control 
window disappear.
Figure 7-5: A close button appears in the upper-left corner of 
any virtual desktop that you can delete.

Additional Ideas for Using Mission Control
You can use Mission Control to organize related program windows in separate 
virtual desktops. For example, you might put all your word processing windows 
on one Space and all your spreadsheet windows on another. You could also put 
all windows related to a specific project in one Space and all windows related to a 
second project in a second Space.
Mission Control helps you organize multiple open windows in any way that 
makes sense to you. As long as you don’t forget how you organized your windows 
in different virtual desktops, you’ll be able to stay more organized and be more 
efficient in anything you want to do with your Macintosh. Even if you never create a 
Space, you can still use Mission Control to quickly get a handle on lots of windows.

The Dock can be handy for storing your most 
frequently used programs, but the more pro-
gram icons you store on the Dock, the smaller 
all the icons get. Eventually if you store too 
many program icons on the Dock, you may 
have trouble finding the program icon you 
want at any given time.
To avoid making your Dock hard to use, 
you can just open the Application folder to find 
a program you want to run. However, the more 
programs you install on your Macintosh, the 
more crowded your Application folder can get. 
For a faster alternative to finding and running a 
program, use Launchpad instead.
Opening Apps 
with Launchpad

Chapter 8
The basic idea behind Launchpad is to display all your program icons in neat 
rows and columns on the screen. Then you can click the program icon that you 
want to run.
Project goal: Learn to use Launchpad to run any program on your Macintosh.
What You’ll Be Using
To learn how to run programs on your Macintosh through Launchpad, you’ll use 
the following:
>
>
Launchpad
>
>
The Safari web browser
>
>
The Finder program
Starting and Closing Launchpad
The Launchpad icon appears in two places: on the Dock and inside the Applica-
tions folder, as shown in Figure 8-1. The three ways to start Launchpad are:
>
>
Click the Launchpad icon on the Dock.
>
>
Double-click the Launchpad icon inside the Applications folder.
>
>
Use a four-finger pinch gesture on the trackpad.
No matter how you start Launchpad, its appearance on the screen consists 
of program icons arranged in rows and columns, as shown in Figure 8-2.
Figure 8-1: The location of the Launchpad icon

To close Launchpad, you have several options:
>
>
Press the esc key.
>
>
Click in any empty space on the Launchpad screen.
>
>
Click the Launchpad icon on the Dock.
Navigating the Launchpad Screen
If you have a large number of programs installed on your Macintosh, Launchpad 
might not be able to display all of your program icons on a single screen. Instead, 
Launchpad must display additional program icons on multiple screens. To navigate 
between multiple Launchpad screens, you have two choices:
>
>
Press the left or right arrow keys.
>
>
Slide two fingers left or right on the trackpad, or click and drag with the 
mouse.
To see how to use Launchpad to open applications, follow these steps: 
1.	
Click the Launchpad icon that appears on the Dock, double-click the 
Launchpad icon in the Applications folder, or pinch four fingers on the track-
pad. The Launchpad screen appears.
2.	
Move the mouse pointer over the Safari icon and click. Safari loads and 
Launchpad disappears.
3.	
Open Launchpad again (click the Launchpad icon on the Dock, etc.). The 
Launchpad screen appears. 
Figure 8-2: The appearance of Launchpad

Chapter 8
4.	
Press the left and right arrow keys (or slide two fingers on the trackpad) to 
view any additional Launchpad screens showing other program icons. Mouse 
users can also click and drag to view other Launchpad screens.
5.	
Press the esc key to make the Launchpad screen go away. 
Rearranging Icons on Launchpad 
Launchpad displays your program icons in rows and columns. If you don’t like the 
default arrangement, you can rearrange your icons at any time. 
To rearrange Launchpad icons, do this:
1.	
Start Launchpad, and then move the mouse pointer over the program icon 
you want to move.
2.	
Hold down the mouse button and drag the icon to a new location. As you 
drag the icon around the screen, the other icons will slide out of the way.
3.	
Release the mouse button to place your icon in its new location.
Organizing Icons into Launchpad Folders
If you have installed numerous programs on your Macintosh, Launchpad will 
contain multiple screens of individual program icons. In case you want to group 
related programs together, you can store them inside a folder. 
Creating a Launchpad Folder
To create a folder, do this:
1.	
Open Launchpad (click the Launchpad icon on the Dock, etc.).
2.	
Move the mouse pointer over a program icon and drag and drop it over a 
second program icon, as shown in Figure 8-3. Launchpad displays the con-
tents of your newly created folder.
3.	
(Optional) To rename your folder, just click once on the name your Mac gave 
the folder, type a new name, and press return.
Removing a Program from a Launchpad 
Folder
A folder can hold two or more program icons. If you want to take a program icon 
out of a folder and put it back on the Launchpad screen, do this:
1.	
Open Launchpad, and then click a folder that contains multiple program 
icons. A list of all program icons inside that folder appears.
2.	
Move the mouse pointer over the program icon you want to remove from 
the folder and drag it outside of the folder area until you see the Launchpad 
screen.

3.	
Drag the program icon on the Launchpad screen and then drop it in a 
desired location. 
Additional Ideas for Using Launchpad
If you’re familiar with the way the iPhone and iPad work, you’ll find Launchpad 
works nearly identically. If you’re not familiar with the iPhone or iPad, you may find 
Launchpad a bit strange, so feel free to ignore it altogether if you wish, since you 
already know how to open applications via the Dock and the Applications folder.
If you like Launchpad, you can make your Macintosh display the Launchpad 
screen every time you log in to your account. To make Launchpad appear auto-
matically, do this:
1.	
Click the Apple menu and choose System Preferences. The System Prefer-
ences window appears.
2.	
Click the Users & Groups icon under the System category. A Users & 
Groups window appears.
3.	
Click your account in the left pane.
4.	
Click the Login Items tab. 
5.	
Click the plus button. A list of all your programs appears.
6.	
Click Launchpad and click the Add button.
The next time you start your Macintosh or log in to your account, the Launch-
pad screen will appear right away.

Wrangling 
Files and 
Folders

You can think of your hard disk as a big attic 
full of boxes of data. After storing stuff in the 
attic, you may have trouble finding it again. 
The same is true after you store files on your 
hard disk. To help you look for files on your 
Macintosh, you can use a program called 
the Finder.
Project goal: Learn to use the Finder pro-
gram to look for files stored on your Macintosh 
hard disk.

What You’ll Be Using
To view the contents of your hard disk, you’ll use the following:

The Finder program
Understanding Drives, Folders, and Files
Every Macintosh has a hard drive that stores data; you can also attach additional 
storage drives to your Macintosh, like an external hard drive or a USB flash drive. 
Since any type of storage drive can store thousands (maybe even millions) of files, 
most drives use folders to organize their contents into manageable pieces.
Folders provide separate compartments used for storing related files and 
folders in one place. To help you stay organized, the hard disk on every Macintosh 
starts with default folders for storing related files, as shown in Figure 9-1. If you 
want to save a Document or Movie, now you know exactly where to put it. 
If more than one person uses your Mac, you can create one or more accounts 
where each account has its own set of folders (you’ll see how to create a second 
user account in Chapter 19). Within every account, each user has several folders:
>
>
Desktop  Contains any files and folders placed on the desktop, which 
appears between the menu bar and the Dock
>
>
Documents  Contains all files and folders created and saved in programs 
such as word processor programs, spreadsheet programs, presentation 
programs, and so on
>
>
Applications  Contains all programs installed on your Macintosh
>
>
Downloads  Contains all files and folders downloaded from the Internet, 
such as programs you’ve purchased from a website or file attachments that 
other people have sent to you by email
>
>
Movies  Contains digital video files, such as those created by iMovie
>
>
Music  Contains digital audio files, such as those stored by iTunes
Figure 9-1: Each user gets his own set of folders.

Pictures  Contains digital image files, such as those stored by iPhoto

>
Public  Contains the Drop Box folder, where users working on other com-
puters on your local network can drop off files for you to retrieve
>
>
Sites  Contains all files and folders used to create web pages to display on 
a website; if you don’t create any web pages, this folder will be empty
Understanding the Finder Window
The Finder lets you view the contents of one folder at a time. The left side of 
the Finder window contains the sidebar, which lists three categories, as shown 
in Figure 9-2:
>
>
Favorites  Lists commonly used folders, such as Applications and 
Documents
>
>
Shared  Lists all computers connected to your local network; if your Macin-
tosh isn’t connected to a network, the Shared category will not appear
>
>
Devices  Lists all storage devices attached to your Macintosh, such as hard 
disks, flash drives, or CDs/DVDs
To start the Finder, click the Finder icon (it looks like a square smiling face) on 
the Dock. If the Finder icon doesn’t appear on the Dock, select FileNew Finder 
Window. (Try it now!)
Figure 9-2: The Finder window lets you switch to a different folder or drive 
and view its contents.

Chapter 9
Viewing All Your Files
One of the biggest problems with creating and storing files is that you can have 
so many folders buried within your hard disk that it’s nearly impossible to find 
anything again. To help you find a file, Mac OS X offers two options: All My Files 
and Search.
The All My Files feature displays all your files in a single list, no matter where 
those files may be stored. You can then sort through this list alphabetically, by type, 
and date last opened. The Search feature lets you type part or all of a filename 
that you want to find.
Using All My Files
When you want to search through all the files stored on your hard disk, you may 
want to use the All My Files feature by doing the following:
1.	
Click the Finder icon on the Dock. The Finder window appears.
2.	
Click All My Files in the sidebar of the Finder window under the Favorites 
category. The right pane of the Finder window displays a list of your files 
organized into categories such as Images, PDF Documents, Music, Movies, 
Presentations, and Documents, as shown in Figure 9-3.
3.	
Scroll up and down until you find the file you want. Notice that the Finder 
displays the most recently opened file at the top of each category, so if you 
know the approximate date you last accessed a file, you can find it faster.
Figure 9-3: Clicking All My Files displays all your files organized into 
categories.

	
Navigating Through Folders with the Finder

79
Searching for a File
If you know part or all of the name of the file you want to find, it’s much faster just 
to type its name in the Search text field that appears in the upper-right corner of 
the Finder window. To see how this Search feature works, follow these steps:
1.	
Click the Finder icon on the Dock. The Finder window appears.
2.	
Click in the Search field in the upper-right corner of the Finder window.
3.	
Type the first few letters of a filename, such as ab, as shown in Figure 9-4. The 
Finder window displays a list of files that match your criteria. The more letters 
you type, the fewer files the Finder window displays.
Viewing a Folder Hierarchy
If you know where to find a specific file, you can dig through the hierarchy of fold-
ers to find what you want. Since folders can be buried inside other folders, open-
ing several folders can get you lost in the hierarchy. To keep yourself oriented as 
you navigate through multiple folders, you need to know how to open a folder, 
determine where you are, and return to your starting point.
Changing the View of Folders
The Finder window can display the contents of a folder in four different ways, as 
shown in Figure 9-5:
>
>
Icons  Displays files and folders as large icons
>
>
List  Displays files and folders as tiny icons, with names and the dates and 
times that they were last modified
Figure 9-4: Typing in the Search text field displays files that match 
your typed criteria.

Chapter 9
>
>
Columns  Displays files and folders in columns so you can easily see the 
folder hierarchy
>
>
Cover Flow  Displays files and folders as large icons in a “jukebox” display 
with a List view underneath.
To change the view of a folder, do the following:
1.	
Click the Finder icon on the Dock. The Finder window appears.
2.	
Click the Applications folder in the sidebar of the Finder window. The con-
tents of the Applications folder appear in the Finder window.
3.	
Click the List button or select View4as List. Notice how the Finder window 
changes the way your files and folders appear.
4.	
Click the Columns button or select View4as Columns.
5.	
Click the Cover Flow button or select View4as Cover Flow.
6.	
Click the Icons button or select View4as Icons.
Q
Q Note: If you want to define a default appearance for a particular folder, click 
that folder and then select View4Show View Options to see all the options 
you can customize for a folder.
Jumping to a Specific Folder
The sidebar of the Finder window lists commonly used folders such as Documents. 
For another way to jump to specific folders, use the Go menu. The Go menu lists 
commonly used folders such as Documents and Downloads.
Figure 9-5: Views let you see your files and folders in different ways.

Navigating Through Folders with the Finder	
|	
81
The Go menu also lists a Recent Folders submenu that lists the most recently 
accessed folders, as shown in Figure 9-6. The theory is that you’re most likely to 
need a file that you recently stored rather than a file you may have stored five 
years ago.
Opening a Folder
To open a folder and view its contents, you have three choices:
>
>
Double-click a folder.
>
>
Click a folder and select FileOpen (or press -O).
>
>
Right-click a folder and select Open.
To practice opening folders, try the following:
1.	
Click the Finder icon on the Dock. The Finder window appears.
2.	
Click the Home icon that appears in the sidebar of the Finder window. (The 
name of the Home icon will be whatever name you chose for your account, 
such as John Doe.) The right pane of the Finder window displays folders like 
Applications, Desktop, Movies, and Pictures.
Figure 9-6: The Recent Folder option lets you quickly jump to a folder 
you accessed a short time ago.

82	
|	
Chapter 9
3.	
Open the Documents folder by using one of the three methods listed ear-
lier (double-click, select and press -O, or right-click and select Open). The 
contents of the Documents folder appear in the right pane of the Finder 
window.
4.	
Choose GoComputer. The right pane of the Finder window displays the 
contents of the Computer folder, which shows icons representing all your 
storage devices, such as the hard disk in your Macintosh, any external hard 
disks, or any USB flash drives attached to your computer.
Identifying Your Location in the Folder Hierarchy
Each time you open a folder, you go deeper into the folder hierarchy. Unfortu-
nately, you may open multiple folders and then lose track of exactly where you 
are. To identify your current location in the folder hierarchy, you can right-click a 
window’s title bar to see a list of all the folders that lead to your current location, as 
shown in Figure 9-7.
In this figure, the list of folders tells you the following:
>
>
The Documents folder is the current folder displayed in the Finder window.
>
>
The Documents folder is inside the Home folder named cassandrawang.
>
>
The Home folder cassandrawang is inside the Users folder.
>
>
The Users folder is stored on the Macintosh HD (hard disk).
>
>
The Macintosh HD is connected to the computer identified as Cassandra 
Wang’s MacBook Air.
Figure 9-7: The list of folders shows your current location in the folder 
hierarchy.

	
Navigating Through Folders with the Finder

83
This list of the folder hierarchy serves two purposes. First, it helps you iden-
tify your current location in the folder hierarchy. Second, it provides a quick way to 
view the contents of any folder in this hierarchy list just by clicking its name.
To see how to display the folder hierarchy and switch to a different folder, do 
the following:
1.	
Click the Finder icon on the Dock. The Finder window appears.
2.	
Click Documents in the sidebar of the Finder window. The right pane dis-
plays the contents of the Documents folder.
3.	
Right-click the Finder window title bar (which displays Documents in the mid-
dle-top portion of the window). A list showing the folder hierarchy appears.
4.	
Click Macintosh HD. The Finder window displays the contents of your Mac-
intosh hard disk and now displays Macintosh HD in its title bar.
Q
Q Note: Right-clicking the title bar of a window works in other program win-
dows as well, such as a Microsoft Word or Keynote window.
Navigating Back and Forth Through Folders
Each time you open a folder, you dig deeper into the folder hierarchy. To move 
back up a folder hierarchy, you have two choices:
>
>
Select GoEnclosing Folder.
>
>
Click the back arrow in the upper left-corner of the Finder window. (After you 
have clicked the back arrow once, you can click the forward arrow to move 
forward.)
To see how to navigate back and forth through a folder hierarchy, refer to the 
folder hierarchy in Figure 9-1 and try the following:
1.	
Click the Finder icon on the Dock. The Finder window appears.
2.	
Click Documents in the sidebar of the Finder window. The right pane dis-
plays the contents of the Documents folder.
3.	
Choose GoDownloads. The Finder window displays the files you have 
downloaded. (If you haven’t downloaded anything from the Internet, the 
Downloads folder will be empty.)
4.	
Click the back arrow in the upper-left corner of the Finder window. The 
Finder window displays the contents of the last folder displayed in the Finder 
window, which was the Documents folder.
5.	
Click the forward arrow in the upper-left corner of the Finder window. The 
Finder window displays the contents of the Downloads folder again.
6.	
Select GoEnclosing Folder. The Finder window displays the contents of 
the Home folder, which contains the Downloads folder.
Selecting the GoEnclosing Folder command always displays the folder 
that contains (encloses) the folder whose contents appear in the Finder window. 
Clicking the back arrow always returns you to the previous Finder window viewed, 
which may not be the folder that contains the currently displayed folder.

Additional Ideas for Navigating the Folder 
Hierarchy
If navigating through the folder hierarchy of your hard disk gets too cumbersome, 
you can place the folders that you access most often in the sidebar of the Finder 
window or as a stack on the right side of the Dock.
Placing a Folder in the Finder Sidebar
The Finder sidebar gives you one-click access to folders, and you can add your 
favorite folders to the sidebar by doing this:
1.	
Click the Finder icon on the Dock. The Finder window appears.
2.	
Open the folder that contains the folder you want to place in the sidebar. 
(So, for example, if you want to add the Downloads folder to the sidebar, 
open the Home folder, which contains the Downloads folder.)
3.	
Drag the chosen folder to the sidebar under the Favorites category. A hori-
zontal line appears to show you where your folder will appear when you 
release the mouse button.
4.	
Release the mouse button when the horizontal line appears where you want 
your folder to appear in the sidebar.
Q
Q Note: To remove a folder from the sidebar, right-click the folder in the side-
bar and select Remove From Sidebar. Removing a folder from the sidebar 
does not delete the folder or any files inside.
Placing a Folder as a Stack on the Dock
In addition to placing your favorite folders on the sidebar, you can also place a 
folder as a stack on the Dock for one-click access. Here’s how:
1.	
Click the Finder icon on the Dock. The Finder window appears.
2.	
Open the folder that contains the folder you want to place on the Dock. (If, 
for example, you want to add the Movies folder to the Dock, open the Home 
folder, which contains the Movies folder.)
3.	
Drag your chosen folder to the right side of the divider (which looks like a 
thick dotted line) on the Dock. Any existing stacks slide out of the way.
4.	
Release the mouse button to place your chosen folder as a stack on the 
Dock. Now you can click this stack any time to access the files inside.
Q
Q Note: To remove a stack from the Dock, drag the stack off the Dock and 
release the mouse button. The stack disappears in a puff of animated smoke. 
Removing a stack from the Dock does not delete the folder or any files inside.
If you store your favorite folders in the Finder sidebar or on the Dock, you’ll 
never lose track of your files again.

Your Macintosh stores data in files. To create a 
file, you need to use a program such as a word 
processor program, a paint program, a spread-
sheet program, or a presentation program. 
Every time you create a file that you want to 
keep, you must save it, name it, and specify a 
folder where you want to store it.
Filenames are for your benefit, so you 
should choose descriptive names, such as 
Transcripts from the voices in my head or Tax 
Returns 2015. You can store files on any storage 
device or drive, but you’ll probably store similar 
files together in a folder to make it easy to find 
them when you need them later.

Chapter 10
After you’ve created a file or folder, you can copy or move that file or folder 
to a new location at any time. You might also want to rename a file or folder. Just as 
you can store and rearrange stuff in your home, you can store and rearrange stuff 
saved on your Macintosh.
Project goal: Learn to create, view, copy, move, and rename files and folders 
stored on your Macintosh.
What You’ll Be Using
To create, view, copy, move, and rename files and folders, you’ll use the following:
>
>
The Finder program
>
>
The TextEdit program
Creating Files and Folders
To create a file, you first need to create new data (by typing text or drawing a picture, 
for example) using a program (such as a word processor or paint program). You then 
select FileSave to save the file. To create a folder, you have two options:
>
>
Create a new folder in the Save dialog.
>
>
Create a new folder in the Finder window.
Creating a Folder in the Save Dialog
If you’ve used a computer before, you know that you need to save your data peri-
odically in case your computer crashes or the power suddenly goes out. Fortu-
nately, Mac OS X 10.7 Lion automatically saves your data as you create it. That way 
if the computer does crash or the power goes out, you won’t lose any data.
Even though Lion can save your data, you’ll still need to store that data in 
a file eventually. When you save a file for the first time, you will name the file and 
define where to store it. At this time, you can store a file in an existing folder or cre-
ate a new folder in which to store the file.
To see how to create a new folder using the Save dialog, do this:
1.	
Click the Finder icon on the Dock. The Finder window appears.
2.	
Click the Applications folder, and then double-click the TextEdit icon to load 
the TextEdit program. The TextEdit window appears.
3.	
Type a sentence.
4.	
Select TextEditQuit. TextEdit quits without asking if you want to save your 
file first.
5.	
Start TextEdit again. Notice that when the TextEdit window appears, the 
sentence that you typed still appears in the window, courtesy of Lion’s ability 
to preserve the contents of windows even without saving the data to a file.
6.	
Select FileSave. A Save As dialog appears, as shown in Figure 10-1.

Click a folder in the left pane of the Save As dialog, such as Documents. The 
middle pane displays the folders and files stored in that folder.
9.	
(Optional) Click a folder in the middle pane. A right pane appears, showing 
the contents of this folder. Repeat this step for any folder whose contents 
you want to view. 
10.	
Click the New Folder button. A New Folder dialog appears.
11.	
Type a descriptive name for your folder and click Create. At this point, you 
can type a name for your file and store it in your newly created folder by 
clicking Save.
Creating a Folder in the Finder Window
You can also create a new folder using the Finder window. Here’s how:
1.	
Click the Finder icon on the Dock. The Finder window appears.
2.	
Open the folder, such as Documents, where you want to create a new folder.
3.	
Select FileNew Folder. An untitled folder appears.
4.	
Type a descriptive name for your folder and press return.
Sorting Files
By default, your Macintosh normally sorts files alphabetically so that files that 
begin with an A appear before those that begin with a T. However, you can sort 
files in different ways to help you find the particular file you want.
To see how to sort files, follow these steps:
1.	
Click the Finder icon on the Dock. A Finder window appears.
2.	
Click a folder, such as the Documents folder. 
3.	
Select ViewArrange By to see the submenu displaying different ways to 
sort items, as shown in Figure 10-3.

your files.
Q
Q Note: You can also click the Change the item arrangement icon in the middle 
of the Finder window to display a similar menu of different sorting options, 
as shown in Figure 10-4.
Peeking Inside a File
The Finder window can show you where your files are located. If you want to see 
the contents inside your files, you could double-click a file to open it, but a faster 
method is to use the Quick Look feature.
The Quick Look feature lets you peek at a file’s contents without having to 
start a program. To use the Quick Look feature, click a filename and then do one 
of the following:
>
>
Click the Quick Look button (it looks like an eye in the top of the Finder 
window).
>
>
Press -Y.
>
>
Press the spacebar.
>
>
Select FileQuick Look.
>
>
Right-click a filename and select Quick Look.

Click the Full Screen icon in the upper-right corner of the Quick Look window 
to display the file contents in the entire screen.
>
>
Click the Open with... button in the upper-right corner to open the file in a 
program that will let you view and possibly edit it as well, such as Pages or 
Preview.
>
>
Click the close button in the upper-left corner to close the Quick Look 
window.
Renaming a File or Folder
After you’ve created a file or folder, you might want to rename it, especially if you 
misspelled the filename or folder name. To rename a file or folder, do this:
1.	
Click the Finder icon on the Dock. The Finder window appears.
2.	
Open the folder that contains the file or folder you want to rename.

3.	
Click the file or folder you want to rename. The filename or folder name 
appears highlighted.
4.	
Press return. A text box appears around the filename or folder name so you 
can edit it.
5.	
Type a new name or use the arrow and delete keys to edit the existing name.
6.	
Press return. Your file or folder displays its new name.
Deleting a File or Folder
When you no longer need a file or folder, you can get rid of it to save space on 
your hard disk and keep things organized. Just remember that when you delete 
a folder, you also delete all files and folders within it. Before deleting a folder, be 
sure you want to delete everything inside that folder. You can play it safe by delet-
ing files individually and then deleting the folder when it is empty.
Here’s how to delete a file or folder:
1.	
Click the Finder icon on the Dock. The Finder window appears.
2.	
Open the folder that contains the file or folder you want to delete.
3.	
Click the file or folder you want to delete. (Hold down the  key while click-
ing to select multiple files and folders.)
4.	
Drag the selected file(s) or folder(s) over the Trash icon on the Dock, or 
select FileMove to Trash, or right-click the file or folder and choose 
Move to Trash.
Q
Q Note: To retrieve a file or folder from the Trash, click the Trash icon to open 
the Finder window, and then right-click a file or folder. When a pop-up menu 
appears, choose Put Back, which returns the file or folder back to its last loca-
tion before you deleted it. You can also select and drag the deleted files or 
folders to a new location on your hard disk. If you right-click the Trash icon 
on the Dock and click Empty Trash, your Macintosh erases any deleted files 
or folders permanently. Until you click the Empty Trash option, your deleted 
files and folders still take up physical space on your hard disk. 
Copying a File or Folder
The most straightforward way to copy a file or folder is to use the Edit menu’s 
Copy and Paste commands. Here’s how:
1.	
Click the Finder icon on the Dock. The Finder window appears.
2.	
Open the folder that contains the file or folder you want to copy.
3.	
Click to select the file(s) or folder(s) you want to copy. (Hold down the  key 
as you click to select multiple files and folders.)
4.	
Select EditCopy, or press -C.
5.	
Open the folder in which you want to store the copy or copies of your 
selected file(s) or folder(s).
6.	
Select EditPaste, or press -V, to paste your copied files or folders in your 
chosen folder.

Chapter 10
Q
Q Note: If you change your mind about copying and pasting a file or folder to a 
new location, press -Z or select EditUndo Copy immediately after you’ve 
pasted the file. 
You can also copy files and folders from one drive to another by dragging 
them with the mouse. To copy a file or folder by dragging, do the following:
1.	
Click the Finder icon on the Dock. The Finder window appears.
2.	
Open the folder that contains the file or folder you want to copy.
3.	
Click the file or folder you want to copy. (Hold down the  key and click to 
select multiple files and folders.)
4.	
Drag the selected file(s) or folder(s) over a drive listed in the sidebar of the 
Finder window. A plus sign appears in a green circle by the pointer to let you 
know that the dragging mouse is moving a copy of the file or folder rather 
than the actual file or folder itself. 
Q
Q Note: If you hold the pointer over a drive for a few seconds, the Finder win-
dow displays the contents of that drive, so you can then move the pointer 
over a folder on that drive.
5.	
Release the mouse button to copy your chosen file or folder to the location 
displayed inside the Finder window.
Q
Q Note: If you try these steps to copy a folder or file from one folder to another 
on the same drive, hold down the option key as you drag. A plus sign appears 
in a green circle by the pointer to let you know that the mouse is dragging 
copies of the item(s).
Moving a File or Folder
You can move a file or folder in two ways, depending on whether you’re moving a 
file or folder on the same drive or between two different drives. To move a file or 
folder between folders on the same drive, do the following:
1.	
Click the Finder icon on the Dock. The Finder window appears.
2.	
Open the folder that contains the file or folder you want to move.
3.	
Click the file or folder you want to move. (Hold down the  key and click to 
select multiple files and folders.)
4.	
Drag the selected file(s) or folder(s) over another folder on the same drive 
(either inside the right pane of the Finder window or over a folder in the side-
bar) and wait until the Finder window opens the contents of that folder. Keep 
holding down the left mouse button.
5.	
Move the mouse pointer over the folder to which you want to move the file(s) 
or folder(s), and then release the left mouse button when the Finder high-
lights the appropriate folder.

To move a file or folder between two different drives, rather than copy it, 
you must hold down the  key while dragging the item between the drives. (If you 
don’t hold down the  key, you’ll copy the file or folder instead of moving it.) 
To move a file or folder from one drive to another drive, do the following:
1.	
Click the Finder icon on the Dock. The Finder window appears.
2.	
Open the folder that contains the file or folder you want to move.
3.	
Click the file or folder you want to move. (Hold down the  key and click to 
select multiple files and folders.)
4.	
Hold down the  key and drag your selected file(s) or folder(s) over the 
receiving drive in the sidebar of the Finder window. Wait a few seconds until 
the Finder window opens the contents of that drive. Keep holding down the 
left mouse button and the  key.
5.	
Move the mouse pointer over a folder and wait a few seconds until the Finder 
opens that folder. Repeat this as you navigate the folder hierarchy until you 
reach your destination.
6.	
Release the left mouse button and the  key when the Finder highlights the 
folder where you want to move your selected file(s) or folder(s).
Q
Q Note: If you change your mind about moving a file or folder to a new loca-
tion, press -Z or select EditUndo Move immediately after pasting.
Labeling Files and Folders by Color
Normally when you look for files in the Finder window, all files appear as icons and 
a name. Trying to find the one file you want out of a dozen or more files can be 
challenging.
To make visually browsing for a file much easier, you can identify it by one of 
seven color labels: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, or gray.
Here’s how to label a file or folder with a color:
1.	
Click the Finder icon on the Dock. A Finder window appears.
2.	
Open the folder that contain the file or folder you want to label with a color.
3.	
Click the file or folder you want to label with a color.
4.	
Select FileGet Info, or press -I. A Get Info window appears, as shown in 
Figure 10-6.
5.	
Click a color in the Label category.
6.	
Click the close button of the Get Info window. The name of your chosen file 
or folder now appears highlighted in your chosen color.
Q
Q Note: For a faster way to add a color label to a file or folder, right-click that 
file or folder to display a pop-up menu. Then click a color label, as shown in 
Figure 10-7.

Searching Files and Folders by Color
After you’ve labeled one or more files or folders with a color, you can browse 
through the Finder window and quickly see all files or folders of specific colors. To 
make finding color labeled files and folders even faster, you can sort all files and 
folders by color.
Here’s how to sort files or folders by color:
1.	
Click the Finder icon on the Dock. The Finder window appears.
2.	
Open the folder that you want to sort by color.

Additional Ideas for Managing Files and 
Folders
Folders, filenames, and colors can help you stay organized, so take the time to put 
things in order. Whenever your files or folders start looking cluttered or disorga-
nized, think about creating a new folder, moving files to another folder, or deleting 
files to keep things tidy. By peeking inside files using the Quick Look feature, you 
can quickly see which files you need to keep and which files you can safely delete.
Keeping your files and folders organized is an ongoing task, like brushing 
your teeth or filling your car with gas, and it lets you spend more time working and 
less time searching for information on your Macintosh. Spend a little time periodi-
cally to keep your files and folders organized. You’ll be glad you did.
Figure 10-8: Color coding can group related files together.


11
The longer you use your Macintosh, the more 
files you’ll create and save. And the more files 
you create, the more effort you’ll need to put 
into keeping everything organized.
Fortunately, your Macintosh offers two 
ways to help you find files. You can use a feature 
called Spotlight to search for a specific file just 
by typing a single word or phrase. For example, 
if you search for the word Taxes, Spotlight will 
find all files that contain the word Taxes either 
in the filename or anywhere inside the file itself.

Chapter 11
You can also keep things organized by storing files in folders that can be 
quickly accessible. Instead of wading through multiple folders stored inside the 
Documents folder to find what you want, you can store a folder in the Finder win-
dow or on the Dock so that you can view it quickly with a single click.
By using Spotlight to search for files and the Finder and Dock to access 
­folders, you’ll make it easier to find files when you need them.
Project goal: Learn to find files using Spotlight and store folders in the 
Finder window and Dock.
What You’ll Be Using
To find files and store them in easily accessible folders, you’ll use the following:
>
>
Spotlight
>
>
The Dock
>
>
The Finder program
>
>
The TextEdit program
Finding Specific Files with Spotlight
Spotlight allows you to search for files by name or content. For example, to find a 
file named Customers, you could type Customers or just Cust into the search field. 
Q
Q Note: If you don’t know the name of the file that you want, just type a word 
that appears in that file. For example, to find a file that contains a report 
about Microsoft, tell Spotlight to search for the word Microsoft.
You can access Spotlight through the Finder window or the menu bar. Using 
Spotlight in the Finder window searches only for files, while Spotlight on the menu 
bar searches for more than just files, such as contacts and web pages.
Using Spotlight Through the Finder
To see how Spotlight works through the Finder, follow these steps:
1.	
Click the Finder icon on the Dock. The Finder window appears.
2.	
Click in the Spotlight search field in the upper-right corner of the Finder

Using Smart Folders
If you’re organizing tax information, you could type the word Taxes in Spotlight 
every time you need to find a file related to your taxes. But if you added a new tax 
file or deleted an old tax file, you’d have to retype Taxes into the Spotlight search 
field to see all the current tax-related files.
To automate this process, you can use a Smart Folder instead. A Smart Folder 
saves a Spotlight search (such as the word Taxes), so every time you add or delete 
files that contain the word Taxes, the Smart Folder updates its contents automati-
cally to include those files. No matter how many times you add new tax files or 
delete old ones, the Smart Folder always displays the updated list of tax files with-
out forcing you to retype Taxes into Spotlight ever again.
Q
Q Note: Smart Folders don’t physically contain files. Instead, they contain links 
to the actual files stored elsewhere on your hard disk.
Here’s how to create a Smart Folder:

Additional Ideas for Finding Files
For speedier file searching, you can combine the various file-searching tech­niques 
shown in this chapter. For example, use Spotlight to find files and then create a 
Smart Folder so you’ll be able to find those types of files again. If you find yourself 
searching often, you can use descriptive filenames to avoid the hassle of organiz-
ing your files into folders.
Even if you can’t stay organized, you’ll find that with the help of your Mac­
intosh, finding your important files can be a lot easier than you might think, just 
as long as you can stay organized long enough to remember how to use Spotlight 
and Smart Folders.

If you want to share files between ­computers, 
the simplest method is to copy the files to 
a USB flash drive and then plug that flash 
drive into the second computer. If you have 
a blank CD or DVD, you could save a file on 
the disc and then pop the disc into the other 
computer—but how often do you have a blank 
CD or DVD on hand?
Rather than fiddle with flash drives or discs, 
you have two wireless options for sharing files 
between Macintosh computers. The first option 
uses a wireless connectivity standard called 
Bluetooth (which is often used to connect wire-
less keyboards and mice to a computer). The 
second option is called AirDrop, which uses 
a Wi-Fi connection to share files between 
Macintosh computers.
Project goal: Learn to share files wirelessly 
using Bluetooth and AirDrop.

What You’ll Be Using
To swap files wirelessly, you’ll use the following:
>
>
The Bluetooth File Exchange program
>
>
The Finder program
Checking for Bluetooth Capability
All new Macintosh computers have Bluetooth capability, but older Macintosh com-
puters do not. To add Bluetooth capability to an older Mac, you can buy a Blue-
tooth adapter that plugs into your Macintosh.
Before you can swap files using Bluetooth, you must be sure that both com-
puters have Bluetooth capability. Here’s how to check:
1.	
Click the Apple menu and select System Preferences. A System Prefer-
ences window appears.
2.	
Look for a Bluetooth icon under the Internet & Wireless category. If you see 
a Bluetooth icon, your Macintosh has Bluetooth capability. If you don’t see a 
Bluetooth icon, your Macintosh does not have Bluetooth capability.
3.	
Click the close button of the System Preferences window.
Turning On Bluetooth Sharing
Before you can use Bluetooth on your Macintosh, you might need to turn on Blue-
tooth capability and Bluetooth Sharing on each Macintosh that you want to share 
files on:
1.	
Click the Apple menu and select System Preferences. A System Prefer-
ences window appears.
2.	
Click Bluetooth under the Internet & Wireless category. The Bluetooth win-
dow appears.
3.	
Select the On checkbox to turn on Bluetooth. (Clearing this checkbox turns 
off Bluetooth.)
4.	
Select the Discoverable checkbox so your Macintosh can accept files from

Sharing Files with Bluetooth
Once you’ve turned on Bluetooth, you can share files wirelessly with other Macin-
tosh computers in a classroom, coffeehouse, or anywhere you have two Macintosh 
computers near each other (within approximately 10 meters of each other). Here’s 
how to share files:
1.	
Make sure both Macintosh computers have Bluetooth capability, and both 
have Bluetooth turned on, the Discoverable checkbox selected, and Blue-
tooth Sharing selected. (See “Checking for Bluetooth Capability” and “Turn-
ing On Bluetooth Sharing” on page 106.)
2.	
Click the Finder icon on the Dock. The Finder window appears.
3.	
Select GoUtilities. A Finder window appears, listing the contents of the 
Utilities folder.
4.	
Double-click the Bluetooth File Exchange program icon. A Select File to 
Send dialog appears, letting you choose a file, as shown in Figure 12-2.

Click the Macintosh that 
you want to receive your 
files, and click Send. An 
Incoming File Transfer 
dialog appears on the 
screen of the other 
Macintosh, offering its 
user a chance to accept 
or decline the files 
being sent, as shown 
in Figure 12-4.
Q
Q Note: The first time you connect two Macintosh computers through Blue-
tooth, you may need to verify the synchronization through a dialog that dis-
plays a unique number. If this number on one Macintosh matches the number 
displayed on the second Macintosh, you can verify that you are connected to 
a computer you trust. 
8.	
Click Accept (optional: select the Accept all checkbox). Your files start trans-
ferring from one Macintosh to the other.

Using AirDrop
Another way to share files wirelessly is through a feature called AirDrop, which 
relies on a Wi-Fi network. To use AirDrop, you need one of the following Macintosh 
models:
>
>
iMac (early 2009 or newer) 
>
>
MacBook (late 2008 or newer)
>
>
MacBook Air (late 2010 or newer) 
>
>
MacBook Pro (late 2008 or newer)
>
>
Mac mini (mid 2010 or newer)
>
>
Mac Pro (early 2009 with AirPort Extreme card, or mid 2010)
Figure 12-4: You must accept or decline a 
file transfer from another Macintosh.

110	 |	
Chapter 12
Q
Q Note: If you have an older Macintosh, then you won’t be able to use AirDrop, 
because older Macintosh computers lack the Wi-Fi chip necessary to work 
with AirDrop.
To use AirDrop, make sure both computers are in a Wi-Fi hotspot and then 
follow these steps:
1.	
Click the Finder icon on the Dock. A Finder window appears. Do this step on 
both computers.
2.	
Look for the AirDrop icon in the Finder sidebar. If you do not see the AirDrop 
icon, then that Macintosh can’t share files using AirDrop.
3.	
On each computer, click the AirDrop icon in the sidebar of the Finder win-
dow. Icons representing each AirDrop-capable computer appear, as shown 
in Figure 12-5.
4.	
Drag a file over the icon that represents the Macintosh computer you 
want to receive your file. (You may need to open another Finder window 
by choosing File4New Finder Window.) A confirmation dialog appears, as 
shown in Figure 12-6.
5.	
Click Send (or Cancel). Your file now transfers wirelessly through Wi-Fi to the 
other Macintosh computer. A dialog appears on the receiving Macintosh as 
shown in Figure 12-7, asking if you want to Save and Open, Decline, or Save 
the file.
6.	
Choose Save and Open if you want to view the file right away, or just Save if 
you want to save it without viewing the file. 
Q
Q Note: AirDrop saves files in the Downloads folder.

Additional Ideas for Transferring Files 
Wirelessly
If you’re in a classroom with your laptop Macintosh, you can swap files with your 
classmates if you get bored. Take your laptop Macintosh to a friend’s house and 
pass along some interesting pictures and files you downloaded off the Internet, 
such as news stories or funny pictures of celebrities or politicians you can’t stand. 
Figure 12-6: A dialog asks that you confirm sharing a file.
Figure 12-7: A dialog asks if you want to accept a file sent by AirDrop.

112	 |	
Chapter 12
If you have two or more Bluetooth-enabled or AirDrop-capable computers at 
home or in an office, use Bluetooth or Wi-Fi as a simple network for swapping files 
back and forth.
If you need to share small files, such as word processor documents or digital 
images, Bluetooth makes sharing files simple and effortless. If you need to share 
larger files, such as video or collections of your favorite songs, AirDrop will be 
faster. In either case, sharing files wirelessly will always be faster and more conve-
nient than copying files to a USB flash drive. Still, don’t forget to keep a USB flash 
drive around for those times when you can’t use Bluetooth or AirDrop to share 
files.

13
If you need to transfer large amounts of data 
from your Macintosh to another computer, 
you can store the files on a CD or DVD. A 
­single CD can hold up to 700MB of data, while 
a ­single DVD can hold 4.7GB. The newest 
­double-layer DVDs are capable of storing up 
to 8.5GB of data.
CDs and DVDs are perfect devices for shar-
ing files with others. Just copy your files to a 
CD or DVD and then mail it or drop it off with 
your friend. Unlike a hard drive, for example, a 
CD or DVD is pretty durable, as long as it’s kept 
in its case. Best of all, nearly every computer 
can read CDs and DVDs, as long as the com-
puter has the right type of drive.

What You’ll Be Using
To store data on CDs and DVDs, you’ll need the following:
>
>
The Disk Utility program
>
>
The Finder program
>
>
Blank CDs or DVDs
Buying Discs 
The two main types of discs are CD (compact disc) and DVD (digital video disc). The 
two variations of these types of discs are read-only (-R) and read/write (-RW). A read- 
only disc allows you to save data on the disc only once. A read/write disc lets you 
erase and reuse the disc multiple times.
The following explains the purpose of the different disc types available:
>
>
CD-R  This CD allows you to store or write data only once. A typical CD‑R 
can hold just under 80 minutes of audio or more than 700MB of data, 
depending on the way it’s designed.
>
>
CD-RW  This recordable CD allows you to erase and store data multiple 
times. CD-RWs can hold as much audio or data as CD-Rs.
>
>
DVD-R/DVD+R  These DVDs allow you to store or write data only once. A 
typical DVD‑R can hold up to 4.7GB of data.
>
>
DVD-RW/DVD+RW  Like CD-RWs, these discs let you write to them and 
erase data multiple times. 
>
>
DVD+R DL/DVD-R DL  These dual layer (DL) DVDs let you write data once. 
They can hold up to 8.5GB of data.
Q
Q Note: DVD-Rs and DVD+Rs store data in different formats, but they store the 
same amount of data. 
Erasing a Read/Write (RW) Disc
If you have a read/write disc (such as a CD-RW or DVD-RW disc) that already con-
tains files, you can erase those files by erasing the entire disc. Here’s how to erase 
a rewritable (RW) disc that already has data stored on it:
1.	
Insert a rewritable CD-RW or DVD-RW in your Macintosh.
2.	
Start the Disk Utility, located in the Utilities folder. The Disk Utility window 
opens, as shown in Figure 13-1.
3.	
Click the CD or DVD drive in the left pane of the Disk Utility window.
4.	
Click the Quickly or Completely radio button in the Erase data on disc group.

Q
Q Note: Clicking the Quickly radio button leaves existing data on the disc, but 
allows the computer to overwrite that data. Clicking the Completely radio 
button physically erases any data on the disc, which takes more time. 
5.	
Click the Erase button at the lower-right corner. A dialog appears, asking if 
you really want to erase the disc.
6.	
Click Erase. The Disk Utility erases your disc. A dialog appears, letting you 
know that your Macintosh can now use the disc.
7.	
Click the Eject button. The disc ejects from the disc drive.

Select Disk UtilityQuit Disk Utility.
Choosing Files to Burn to a CD or DVD
Once you have a blank disc, you can save data to it. To save (or burn) data to a CD 
or DVD, first create a Burn Folder (which identifies what information to burn to a 
disc), and then copy links to the files into this Burn Folder. Finally, tell your Macin-
tosh to start the physical burning process, which saves the files to the disc.

Creating a Burn Folder
To collect the files you want to burn to a disc, first create a Burn Folder.
Q
Q Note: To save space, a Burn Folder never contains actual copies of the files 
you want to burn to a disc; it contains links to the actual files.
To create a Burn Folder and then burn a CD/DVD, do the following:
1.	
Click the Finder icon on the Dock. A Finder window appears.
2.	
Click a folder or drive where you want to create your Burn Folder.
3.	
Select FileNew Burn Folder. A Burn Folder appears in the Finder window, 
as shown in the bottom-right corner of Figure 13-2.
4.	
Click a file that you want to burn to disc. (Hold down the  key and click 
multiple files to select more than one file.) You may need to open and view 
the contents of another drive or folder.
5.	
Select EditCopy. (You can also drag the files over the Burn Folder and 
drop them in; this copies and pastes file icons into the Burn Folder.)
6.	
Open the Burn Folder and select EditPaste Items. Your selected files 
appear as alias icons, with an arrow in the bottom-left corner of each file 
icon, as shown in Figure 13-3.
7.	
Select FileBurn “Burn Folder” to Disc or click the Burn button that 
appears in the upper-right corner of the Finder window. (If you define a 
name for your Burn Folder, you’ll see that name appear in the command 
instead, such as Burn “My Stuff” to Disc if you named your Burn Folder My 
Stuff ). A dialog appears, asking you to insert a blank disc.

Burning Files Directly to Disc
If you have a blank disc and want to burn files to it right away, you can choose this 
alternative method of burning files to a disc:
1.	
Insert a blank CD/DVD into your Macintosh. A dialog appears, asking what 
you want to do with the disc.

Additional Ideas for Burning CDs and DVDs
Now that you know how to burn files to disc, you can make a CD or DVD of your 
favorite digital photographs to send to your friends and relatives. Since the Burn 
Folder holds only links to your actual files, when you click the Burn button, your 
Macintosh will automatically copy the latest versions of your files to the disc.
To practice your CD/DVD burning skills, grab some recordable CDs or DVDs 
and burn your most important files to them. Now store these discs someplace safe 
so that if a catastrophe wipes out your computer, your crucial files will be backed 
up. To protect your data, you should copy your important files to CDs or DVDs 
periodically. You don’t need to back up all your files to a CD or DVD (since that will 
require too many discs). Just back up the handful of your most critical files so you 
always have an additional copy you can rely on in case something ever happens to 
your Macintosh.

One of the biggest hassles with using any 
computer is losing data. To prevent this catas­
trophe, you should periodically save your work. 
Since this requires choosing the Save command 
at regular intervals, it’s no surprise that many 
people forget to do this and wind up losing 
data anyway.
Fortunately, OS X Lion can prevent this 
problem through three new features called 
Resume, Auto Save, and Version. Best of all, 
none of these new features requires you to do 
anything more than learn how to take advan-
tage of them, since they work automatically in 
the background, protecting your data without 
requiring any additional action on your part 
whatsoever.

What You’ll Be Using
To learn how to save and protect your data with your Macintosh, you’ll use the 
following:
>
>
The TextEdit program
>
>
The Safari web browser
>
>
The Finder program
Using Resume and Auto Save
Computers are typically such a pain in the neck because the user wastes most 
of his time taking care of the computer rather than actually using it. That’s what 
makes the Macintosh different. Two of the latest Macintosh features to simplify 
your life are called Resume and Auto Save.
Try this experiment with most computers. Open several programs such as 
a web browser and a word processor, open two or more documents in that word 
processor, and now unplug your computer to simulate a sudden power blackout. 
With other computers, you’ll not only lose any data you didn’t save, but when your 
computer turns back on again, you’ll have to load each program and open the 
documents you were working on just to get back to where you were before the 
power blackout. 
With Resume, you can have a dozen programs running with windows open 
all over the screen, lose power, turn on your computer, and the Resume feature 
restores all your open programs and windows exactly as they appeared before the 
power blackout. 
Even better, the Auto Save feature automatically saves any data you created 
in each of the windows so you never risk losing any data, even if you didn’t explic-
itly save that data using the familiar Save command. Best of all, you don’t have to 
do anything extra to turn on Resume or Auto Save, because they work automati-
cally, all the time, to protect your data.
To see how Resume and Auto Save work, try this:
1.	
Click the Safari icon on the Dock to start Safari. The Safari window appears.
2.	
Click the Finder icon on the Dock to open a Finder window. 
3.	
Click Applications in the sidebar of the Finder window and then double-
click the TextEdit icon to load the TextEdit program.
4.	
Type a sentence or two in the TextEdit window. Make sure you do NOT save 
your TextEdit file. At this point you should have three windows open on the 
desktop: Safari, Finder, and TextEdit.
5.	
Click the Apple menu and choose Restart. A dialog appears, asking if you 
really want to restart your computer.
6.	
Click the Restart button. 

	
Using Resume, Auto Save, and Versions	
|	 121
When your computer restarts, notice that the Safari, Finder, and TextEdit 
windows appear back on the screen (courtesy of Resume) and the text you typed 
(and didn’t save) in the TextEdit window still appears (courtesy of Auto Save). Best 
of all, you never had to take any extra steps to use or turn on Resume or Auto Save. 
Now you can use your Macintosh with confidence that you’ll never lose any impor-
tant data ever again, even if you do forget to use the Save command periodically.
Using Versions
One huge problem with saving files is that each time you save a file, you wipe out 
the older version of that same file. Normally this isn’t a problem, but if you write a 
report, save it, modify it, and save the modifications, you may suddenly realize that 
you accidentally deleted data that you really need. 
One solution is to retrieve a backup copy of your file, rename it, and exam-
ine the renamed version along with your new, modified version. Naturally, this is 
clumsy, so that’s why Lion offers Versions.
The main idea behind Versions is to save different versions of your file auto-
matically. Now if you suddenly need all or part of an older file, you can just view 
that older version of a file, copy the data you need from that older file, and paste it 
into your newer file. If you want, you can even revert back to an older version of a 
file altogether.
The one drawback of Versions is that programs must be specifically created 
to use Versions, so older versions of programs won’t be able to use Versions. Pro-
grams specifically designed to work with Lion, such as the TextEdit program, along 
with the latest version of Apple’s iWork office suite, do support Versions.
To see how Versions can work, do this:
1.	
Click the Finder icon on the Dock to open a Finder window. 
2.	
Click Applications in the sidebar of the Finder window and then double-
click the TextEdit icon to run the TextEdit program.
3.	
Type one sentence in the TextEdit window.
4.	
Select FileSave. A dialog appears, letting you choose a name for your 
file and a folder to store it in. Type a name for your file, such as TestMe, and 
save it.
5.	
Type a second sentence in the TextEdit window. 
6.	
Select FileSave a Version. Notice that the Save command has now 
changed to Save a Version. If a program does not display the Save a Version 
command after you initially save a file, then that program does not support 
Versions in Lion.
7.	
Type a third sentence in the TextEdit window and select FileSave a Version. 
At this point, you have saved three different versions of the same file.
8.	
Move the mouse pointer to the right of the filename in the title bar of the 
TextEdit window. A downward-pointing arrow appears.

Click a window on the right side to view a different version of your file. At this 
point, you can click the Restore button to completely replace your current 
file with a previous version, or you can selectively copy data out of a window 
on the right side and paste it into the window on the left side, which contains 
your current file.

Additional Ideas for Using Resume, Auto 
Save, and Versions
The Resume, Auto Save, and Versions features can protect your data, but they only 
work as long as your computer and hard disk work as well. For complete data pro-
tection, connect an external hard disk to your Macintosh and use Time Machine to 
back up your data automatically (see Chapter 15). Then consider storing your most 
critical data on an online storage site. That way if a complete disaster wipes out 
your Macintosh and external hard disk, you’ll still be able to retrieve your data from 
the Internet using another computer, even in another part of the world.


15
If you accidentally delete a file or if your hard 
disk crashes, you could lose your data for good. 
To back up your crucial files, your Macintosh 
comes with a program called Time Machine.
By attaching an external hard disk to your 
Macintosh, you can use Time Machine to back 
up your files automatically. If you lose a file, you 
can use Time Machine to retrieve it again. You’ll 
never again risk losing a critical file.
Project goal: Learn how to back up your 
files and how to retrieve deleted or lost files.

What You’ll Be Using
To back up and retrieve files on your Macintosh, you’ll need the following:

An external hard disk or Apple’s Time Capsule
Retrieving Files from the Trash
The simplest way to retrieve deleted files is to look for them in the Trash. Every 
time you delete a file, your Macintosh stores it in the Trash. To retrieve files stored 
in the Trash, do the following:
1.	
Right-click the Trash icon on the Dock and select Open. A Finder window 
appears, displaying the contents of the Trash.
2.	
Right-click any file stored in the Trash window. A pop-up menu appears.
3.	
Choose Put Back. Your chosen file returns back to the folder where it was 
stored before you deleted it. (You can also drag a file out of the Trash win-
dow and drop it in any folder you want.)
Q
Q Note: If you empty the Trash and accidentally throw out any files you might 
really need, you can buy a special utility program that can recover deleted 
files. Three popular disk utility programs that can recover deleted files are 
DiskWarrior (http://www.alsoft.com/), TechTool Pro (http://www.micromat 
.com/), and Drive Genius (http://www.prosofteng.com/).
If you’re sure you want to delete files for good, empty the Trash, which frees 
up space on your hard disk. To empty the Trash, right-click the Trash icon on the 
Dock and select Empty Trash.
Q
Q Note: If you point to the Trash icon on the Dock and hold down the left 
mouse button (or the trackpad on a laptop Macintosh) for a few seconds, a 
pop-up menu appears that’s the same as if you right-clicked the Trash icon.
Backing Up and Retrieving Files with 
Time Machine
If you’ve deleted files and emptied the Trash or if your hard disk crashes or cor-
rupts your files, your data may be gone for good unless you’ve been using Time 
Machine. To use Time Machine, you first need to connect an external hard disk (or 
Apple’s Time Capsule) to your Macintosh and then set up Time Machine. As you 
use your Macintosh, Time Machine backs up your files hourly, daily, and weekly. 
The number of backups that Time Machine can save depends on the amount of 
space available on your external hard disk.

Before you can use Time Machine, you must set it up. After that, Time 
Machine will start backing up your files automatically. You won’t have to do a thing.
Setting Up Time Machine
To set up Time Machine with your Macintosh, do the following:
1.	
Connect an external hard disk (or Apple’s Time Capsule) to your Macintosh. 
(If you connect an external hard disk or Time Capsule unit that already con-
tains data, a dialog appears, asking if you want to delete all data currently 
stored on the hard disk. If the data isn’t important, go ahead and choose 
to delete all data on that hard disk. Otherwise, you will need to use another 
hard disk.)

Retrieving Files with Time Machine
After you’ve connected an external hard disk to your Macintosh and turned on 
Time Machine, you can retrieve any lost files that have been backed up to the 
hard disk. The size of your external hard disk determines how far back in time the 
Time Machine program will save backed up files. If you have a large external hard 
disk (such as 500GB or more), you may be able to retrieve files from the past year 
or two. If you have a smaller external hard disk (such as 80GB or less), you may be 
able to retrieve files only from a few months back in time. When your external hard 
disk runs out of room, Time Machine wipes out the oldest files to make room for 
newer files.
To retrieve a backed up file using Time Machine, do the following:
1.	
Click the Time Machine icon on the Dock. (If the Time Machine icon is not 
visible, double-click the Time Machine icon in the Applications folder.) The 
Time Machine window appears, displaying a single Finder window, as shown 
in Figure 15-3.
2.	
(Optional) You can change which folders appear in the Finder window dis-
played by Time Machine. For example, you might need to find a file stored in 
the Applications folder instead of the Documents folder.
3.	
Click the back and forward arrows in the bottom-right corner of the Time 
Machine window, or click the timeline along the right side of the window to 
retrieve a backed up file. For example, if you want to retrieve a file that you 
last saw on December 5, click the back arrow or click the timeline to find the 
December 5 date.
4.	
Click the file or folder you want to retrieve, and then click the Restore button 
in the bottom-right corner of the Time Machine window. Time Machine exits, 
retrieves your chosen file or folder, and stores it back on your hard disk in the 
location where you last stored it.

tosh, knowing that even if you make a horrendous mistake and delete a crucial file, 
you’ll always be able to retrieve it again using Time Machine (provided, of course, 
that you backed up the file using Time Machine first).
Time Machine is great for backing up files, but for even more protection, 
consider offsite storage. Some free offsite storage providers are ADrive (http://
www.adrive.com/) or HugeDrive (http://www.hugedrive.com/). Just take the time to 
copy your crucial files to these storage sites and then if your entire home or office 
burns down with your Macintosh and external hard disk, your data will still be safe 
and retrievable over the Internet.
If your data is important, back it up now. The time most people think about 
backing up their files is after they’ve lost them. You can protect your data by back-
ing up your files today before it’s too late.

Using pull-down menus from the menu bar is 
the most straightforward way to control your 
Macintosh, but it’s not the only way. Since the 
two-step process of clicking a pull-down menu 
and then clicking a command can be cumber-
some, your Macintosh offers three different 
types of shortcuts to help you choose com-
mands faster:

Keyboard shortcuts

favorite commands quickly using a shortcut

What You’ll Be Using
To learn how to use shortcuts, you’ll use the following:
>

The Finder program
>
>
The TextEdit program
Using Keyboard Shortcuts
Every Macintosh program provides shortcut keys you can use for choosing com-
mon commands. You’ll find that using these keyboard shortcuts is often faster than 
clicking through various menus to select commands. Table 16-1 displays the most 
common keyboard shortcuts that work in any program.
Along with the 
­general shortcuts listed in 
Table 16-1, every program 
includes shortcuts that are 
specific to that program. To 
view a program’s particular 
command shortcuts, load 
the program and open the 
pull-down menus. If a com-
mand offers a keyboard 
shortcut, it appears to the 
right of the command, as 
shown in Figure 16-1.
To save space,  
pull-down menus use 
symbols to represent dif-
ferent keys. For example, 
to choose the Print com-
mand, you hold down the 
Command key (), press P, 
and then release both keys. 
Table 16-2 lists some of the 
common symbols you’ll see 
on pull-down menus.
Figure 16-1: Program menus show keyboard 
shortcuts directly to the right of specific 
commands.

Q
Q Note: If you’re a former Windows user who just can’t stop using control for 
your shortcut commands, you can retrain your Mac—just change the modifier 
keys for shortcuts in the System Preferences pane, accessible from the Dock. 
To do this, click the Keyboard settings, then Modifier Keys, and then assign 
Control (^) to Command (z) and vice versa, as shown in Figure 16-2.
Using Buttons
Many programs also display graphical icons or buttons at the top of the window to 
represent a specific command, such as an icon of a printer to represent the Print 
command. By clicking one of these buttons, you can choose a command quickly 
and easily.
Since the purpose of each button may not be obvious from its icon, you can 
move the mouse over a button and wait a moment until a short description of that 
button’s purpose appears, as shown in Figure 16-3.

To see some examples of these one-click buttons, try the following:
1.	
Click the Finder icon on the Dock. The Finder window appears.
2.	
Click Applications in the sidebar of the Finder window.
3.

ance of the Finder window. Notice how fast and easy clicking buttons can be 
compared to using pull-down menus.
Q
Q Note: Not every command has an equivalent icon button or keyboard shortcut.
Using Shortcut Menus
Pull-down menus can overwhelm you with too many choices. To display a limited 
list of useful commands, use shortcut menus, which appear when you right-click an 
item. For example, if you want to delete a file, right-click the filename, and when 
the shortcut menu appears, select Move to Trash.
To see how shortcut menus work, try this:
1.	
Click the Finder icon on the 
Dock. The Finder window 
appears.
2.	
Click Applications in 
the sidebar of the Finder 
window.
3.	
Move the mouse over an 
icon, such as the System 
Preferences icon, and right-
click the mouse. (If you’re 
using a laptop, hold down 
two fingers on the trackpad 
or hold down the control 
key and press the trackpad 
button to simulate a right-
click.) A shortcut menu 
appears, listing commands, 
as shown in Figure 16-4.
4.	
Press esc or click the mouse 
away from the shortcut menu 
to make the menu disappear.
To see how shortcut menus can work with text, do the following:
1.	
Click the Finder icon on the Dock. The Finder window appears.
2.	
Click Applications in the sidebar of the Finder window.
3.	
Double-click the TextEdit icon. The TextEdit window appears.
4.	
Type a sentence.
5.	
Select all or part of your sentence by dragging the mouse over the text.

6.	
Move the mouse over the selected text and right-click. A shortcut menu 
appears, as shown in Figure 16-5. Notice that the shortcut menu displays sev-
eral commands depending on the items you’ve selected and right-clicked.
To see how you can delete files or folders using a shortcut menu, try the 
following:
1.	
Click the Finder icon on the Dock. The Finder window appears.
2.	
Click Documents in the sidebar of the Finder window.
3.	
Select FileNew Folder. An untitled folder appears in the right pane of the 
Finder window.
4.

5.	
Select Move to Trash.
Additional Ideas for Using Shortcuts
You’ll be able to work more efficiently with programs if you memorize basic short-
cuts to save a file, print a file, quit a program, and perform other common tasks. 
Browse through the pull-down menus of your favorite programs and see which 
commands offer keyboard shortcuts or command buttons. Get in the habit of 
right-clicking items to view a shortcut menu of commands. By using shortcuts, 
you’ll be able to control your Macintosh quickly and conveniently.

One of your Mac’s most useful shortcuts is 
called a hot corner. A hot corner is simply one 
corner of the screen that makes your Macintosh 
do something when you move your mouse 
pointer into that corner.
By using hot corners, you can control your 
screensaver, put your Macintosh to sleep, hide 
and display Dashboard programs, and manip­
ulate windows. Hot corners provide another 
way to access your favorite features and control 
your Mac quickly.
Project goal: Define hot corners to control 
different parts of your Macintosh.

Using a Hot Corner
Once you’ve defined a hot corner, you can trigger the hot corner action by moving 
the mouse pointer into the hot corner. To turn off the action designated by the hot 
corner, just move the pointer out of the corner.
Additional Ideas for Using Hot Corners
No matter which features you prefer, hot corners will help you to access those fea-
tures quickly and easily. Experiment with hot corners to determine which features 
you like. Once you start using hot corners, you may find lots of uses for them. Here 
are some ideas:
>
>
The Start Screen Saver option can be handy when you want to run the 
screensaver right away, such as when you’re shopping online for a birthday 
present and the birthday boy or girl wanders into the room. By moving the 
mouse into a Start Screen Saver hot corner, the screensaver kicks in immedi-
ately, hiding your activity.
>
>
The Disable Screen Saver option can be handy when you’re reading some-
thing on the screen and your Macintosh keeps turning on your screensaver 
due to “inactivity.” Rather than turn off the screensaver through the Sys-
tem Preferences window (and have to turn it back on again later), move the 
pointer into a hot corner designated as Disable Screen Saver to keep the 
screensaver from starting up.
Don’t forget you can also use hot corners to access Mission Control, the 
Dashboard, Launchpad, or your desktop.
Figure 17-3: Clicking a pop-up menu displays choices for 
defining a hot corner.

Rather than reach for a paper calendar, a clock, a 
newspaper weather forecast, or a pocket calcu-
lator, you can use a program called Dash­board 
that comes with every new Macintosh.
Dashboard provides a variety of simple 
programs, called widgets, that you can pop 
on the screen at any time and make disappear 
at a moment’s notice. You can be typing in a 
word processor, run Dashboard to view a cal-
endar or check a sport score, and then shove 
Dashboard out of the way again to keep work-
ing in your word processor. If you need informa-
tion at your fingertips, you’ll find Dashboard a 
valuable asset when doing anything with your 
Macintosh.
Project goal: Learn to use and modify 
Dashboard to view different types of widgets 
on the screen.

Adding and Removing Dashboard Widgets
Each time you start Dashboard, it displays a handful of widgets on the screen, 
such as the Calculator, Calendar, and Clock widgets. In case you don’t need a 
certain widget, such as the Clock widget, you can remove it and replace it with 
another widget that you find more useful, such as a widget that tracks stock prices.
You can add or remove as many widgets as you want, although the more 
widgets you display, the more crowded your screen appears. At the very least, 
you’ll need at least one widget to appear when you start Dashboard. You can 
choose from the following default library of Dashboard widgets:
>
>
Address Book  Lets you search for a person stored in your Address Book
>

Additional Ideas for Using Dashboard
Some widgets can be useful (Calculator or World Clock), while others can be for 
fun (Ski Report or Movies). If you regularly need to consult a calendar or an address 
book, you may find the iCal and Address Book widgets particularly useful.
The Address Book widget lets you type all or part of a name to search for 
contact information about a person or company stored in your Address Book, as 
shown in Figure 18-7. By using the Address Book widget, you can view your stored 
contact information without the nuisance of starting Address Book, searching for a 
name, and then quitting Address Book when you’re done.
The iCal widget can be handy when you want to review any scheduled events 
(appointments) for the day. Rather than start iCal and browse through your sched-
uled events, just display the iCal widget on Dashboard. Each time you click the iCal 
widget, it toggles between three states, as shown in Figure 18-8:
>
>
Today’s date
>

The best way to accommodate multiple people 
who want to use a Macintosh is to buy every-
one a separate Macintosh so they’ll leave your 
computer alone. Unfortunately, it’s not always 
practical to buy a separate computer for every-
one, so you can do the next best thing and split 
your Macintosh into “multiple personalities” by 
creating user accounts instead.
When you divide a Macintosh into separate 
user accounts, each user can customize his or 
her account to make the Macintosh take on a 
different personality. One account might have 
a purple background with pictures of cats scat-
tered on the screen, while another account 
might have a plain white background.
More importantly, each account lets a user 
isolate his or her own personal files from those 
of other users. So if you create important busi-
ness records and tax returns in one account, 
Giving Your Macintosh 
Multiple ­Personalities 
with User Accounts

154	 |	
Chapter 19
your 10-year-old daughter can’t accidentally erase all your financial records while 
she’s using a second account. User accounts simply isolate multiple users from 
each other while giving the illusion that each person has complete control over 
every part of the Macintosh.
Project goal: Learn to create, switch between, and delete user accounts on 
a Macintosh.
What You’ll Be Using
To create, use, and remove accounts on your Macintosh, you’ll use the following:
>
>
The System Preferences program
Understanding User Accounts
The first time you plugged in and set up your Macintosh, it guided you through 
the process of typing your name and a password, which essentially created the first 
user account on your computer. Every Macintosh needs at least one user account, 
but if you want to share your Macintosh with other people, you’ll need to set up 
additional accounts. You can create four types of user accounts:
>
>
Administrator  This account allows full access to modifying all parts of the 
Macintosh, including creating and deleting additional accounts. In addition, 
only an Administrator account is able to install software. When you unpacked 
your Macintosh, the first account you created was the Administrator account.
>
>
Standard  This account allows full access to all parts of the Macintosh but 
with no ability to create, modify, or delete other user accounts. A Standard 
account cannot install software.
>
>
Managed with Parental Controls  This account allows restricted access 
to the Macintosh, including time limitations, restricted Internet access, and 
limited program access.
>
>
Sharing Only  This account lets you turn your Macintosh into a server so 
you can share files with others.
As a general rule, you probably want to create only one Administrator 
account on your Macintosh. If you create a second Administrator account, that 
second account can delete your Administrator account and all your files, too. The 
only reason to create two Administrator accounts is if you trust another person 
not to abuse his or her privileges, such as parents using separate Administrator 
accounts so both can create and monitor their children’s accounts.
A Standard account is handy if you want to give someone full access to the 
Macintosh except for the ability to create, modify, or delete other accounts and 
install applications system-wide. For example, if you’re the most computer-savvy 
person in your family, you might want to set up an Administrator account for your-
self but set up Standard accounts for your spouse and kids.

	
Giving Your Macintosh Multiple ­Personalities with User Accounts	
|	 155
A Managed with Parental Controls account is useful for tracking and 
restricting someone’s access to your Macintosh. Managed with Parental Controls 
accounts are commonly used by parents to give their children limited Internet and 
computer access. (To learn more about creating a Managed with Parental Controls 
account, see Chapter 20.)
A Sharing account is handy for letting other computers on a network access 
files stored on your Macintosh.
Every Macintosh comes with a Guest account, which is useful for a Macintosh 
that is located in an area where anyone can use it. By eliminating the need for a 
password, a Guest account gives everyone access to the Macintosh. By refusing 
to save files or allow customizing of the Macintosh, a Guest account prevents any-
one from messing up your computer. You can only have one Guest account on a 
Macintosh (but you can create an unlimited number of other types of accounts). By 
default, your Macintosh has already defined a Guest account, so you won’t have 
to bother going through the motions to create one unless you delete the default 
Guest account.
Creating User Accounts
When creating a user account on your Macintosh, you need to determine these 
three items:
>

Click in the Password Hint text box and type a short phrase that can help 
you remember your password.
12.	
Click Create User. A dialog appears, asking if you want to turn automatic 
login on or off. 
Q
Q Note: Automatic login means that each time you turn on your Macintosh, 
it uses one account without requiring anyone to type a password. If you’re 
the only person using your Macintosh, automatic login can be convenient. 
However, if you create multiple accounts, you probably don’t want automatic 
login turned on, since it will allow anyone to access your Macintosh without a 
password.
13.	
Click Keep Automatic Login or Turn Off Automatic Login.
14.	
Click the close button of the Users & Groups window.
Logging In and Out of an Account
After you’ve created two or more accounts on your Macintosh, you can switch 
between them. One way to switch between accounts is to log out of one account 
and then log in to a second account.
Here’s how to log out of an account:
1.	
Click the Apple menu. A drop-down menu appears, as shown in Figure 19-3.
2.	
Select Log Out. A dialog appears, asking if you really want to log out of your 
account.
3.	
Click Log Out. Your Macintosh displays a screen that lists all account names.
Figure 19-3: The Log Out command appears 
on the Apple menu and displays the name 
of the currently active account.

4.	
Click the name of the account you want to use. A Password text box appears.
5.	
Click in the Password text box and type the password for your chosen 
account. The desktop of the chosen account appears on the screen.
Fast Switching Between Accounts
For a faster and more convenient way to switch between accounts, you can use 
Fast User Switching, which lets you switch accounts. Fast switching just gives you 
one more way to switch accounts.
To use fast switching, do this:
1.	
Click the Fast User Switching menulet that appears on the right of the 
menu bar at the top of the screen. This menulet displays the name of the cur-
rent account name, as shown in Figure 19-4.
2.	
Click the account name you want to use. A dialog appears, asking for the 
password for your chosen account.
3.	
Type the password for your chosen account and press return. Your Macin-
tosh screen flips around like a cube, displaying your chosen account.
Deleting an Account
You can delete an account only from within an Administrator account. When you 
delete an account, you have three choices in regard to saving the contents of the 
deleted account’s Home folder:
>
>
Save the Home folder in a disk image  This option saves all files in a sin-
gle file called a disk image. A disk image stores multiple files in a single file 
so you can easily store and find this file again.
>
>
Don’t change the Home folder  This option leaves all files created by that 
account stored in the Users folder.
>
>
Delete the Home folder  This option deletes all files created by that 
account.
Figure 19-4: The Fast User Switching menulet lets 
you choose a different account by name.

Q
Q Note: You can also select the Erase Home folder securely checkbox, which 
not only erases the Home folder but overwrites the Home folder data with 
random information to make it difficult for anyone to retrieve any data stored 
in that account’s Home folder.
If you want to delete an account and don’t need to save any files created by 
that account, choose Delete the home folder. If you definitely need to save and 
access files created by the account you want to delete, choose Don’t change the 
home folder. If you want to preserve the contents of the account’s files but don’t 
need access to them right away, choose Save the home folder in a disk image.
Here’s how to delete an account:
1.	
Log out of the account you want to delete.
2.	
Click the Apple menu and choose System Preferences. A System Prefer-
ences window appears.
3.	
Click the Users & Groups icon under the System category. A Users & 
Groups window appears.

Additional Ideas for Using Accounts
If your family shares a Macintosh, you can create a separate account for each family 
member. Although only one person can use the Macintosh at a time, each person 
can customize his or her own account, storing songs in iTunes, changing screen 
colors, and storing web page bookmarks.
Even if you’re the only person who uses your Macintosh, consider creating 
separate accounts. One account might contain your important files, while the sec-
ond account can serve as your experimental account, where you can safely try dif-
ferent commands and experiment with different settings just to see what happens. 
If you make changes that wreck your computer settings, just delete that particular 
account, create a new account, and start experimenting with the new account. By 
creating multiple accounts, you can safely learn different features of your Macintosh 
without the risk of wiping out data by mistake or totally wrecking your Macintosh’s 
settings and not knowing how to fix the problem.

20
If you have children in the house, you may 
be leery of giving them unrestricted access to 
your Macintosh and the Internet. Unrestricted 
Internet allows access to any website, including 
pornography, hate groups, and online predators. 
Unrestricted access to your Macintosh allows 
anyone to add or delete programs, rename and 
rearrange folders, and generally mess up the 
tidy organization of the files stored on your 
Macintosh.
To limit a child’s access to both the Internet 
and your Macintosh, you can create a Managed 
with Parental Controls account. You can use this 
account to restrict the times a person can use 
your Macintosh (such as for one hour a day, or 
no later than 9:00 pm), the types of programs 
available and how long they can be used (such 
as a favorite video game for 15 minutes a day),

and which websites and email addresses they can see or contact. Although such 
parental controls aren’t a substitute for close parental supervision, a Managed with 
Parental Controls account gives your Macintosh the power to monitor and restrict 
your child’s access when you’re not around.
Project goal: Learn to create and set up a Managed with Parental Controls 
account for your children to use on your Macintosh.
What You’ll Be Using
To create, set up, and use a Managed with Parental Controls account on your

Setting Parental Controls
Once you’ve created one or more Managed with Parental Controls accounts and 
enabled parental controls, you still need to configure each account to define the 
limitations of that account. You can define five types of limitations for each Man-
aged with Parental Controls account:
>
>
Apps  Defines which programs the account user can run and use
>
>
Web  Restricts which websites the account user can access
>
>
People  Restricts which email addresses and iChat buddies the account 
user can contact
>
>
Time Limits  Defines what days and times the account can be used
>
>
Other  Restricts profanity in the Dictionary program, adding or modifying 
printer settings, burning CDs and DVDs, and changing passwords
Restricting Programs
Normally, every account has access to every program installed on the Macintosh. 
However, you can restrict which programs a Managed with Parental Controls 
account can access, which can be handy for keeping your teenage son from listen-
ing to music (by blocking access to iTunes) or watching DVD movies (by blocking 
access to the DVD Player program) when he should be studying for his chemistry 
final. To restrict which programs a Managed with Parental Controls account can 
use, do the following:
1.	
Follow the steps in “Creating a Managed with Parental Controls Account” on 
page 162 to open the Parental Controls window.
2.	
Click the Apps tab. A list of options appears, as shown in Figure 20-3.
3.	
Select or clear the Use Simple Finder checkbox. If the checkbox is selected, 
the Simple Finder displays icons but doesn’t let you copy, rename, or move 
any files.
4.	
Select or clear the Limit Applications checkbox. If the checkbox is selected, 
you can then select or clear the checkboxes of various programs and pro-
gram categories, such as Internet or Utilities.
5.	
Click the Allow App Store Apps pop-up menu and select an age restriction 
for the type of apps the user can download, as shown in Figure 20-4.
6.	
Select or clear the Allow User to Modify the Dock checkbox. If the check-
box is selected, the user can add, rearrange, and delete icons from the Dock.

Restricting Web Access
One of the biggest dangers of computers is unrestricted Internet access. Not only 
can kids easily find pornography, but they can also find other disturbing images 
and videos from a variety of questionable sources.
To protect your children from viewing inappropriate web pages, you can 
block web access completely, choose which sites the user can access, or choose 
a compromise and give your Macintosh the power to decide which sites to block 
and which to allow (which won’t always be accurate). Three options are available for 
blocking websites, as shown in Figure 20-5:
>
>
Allow unrestricted access to websites  This option allows access to any 
website on the Internet.
>
>
Try to limit access to adult websites automatically  This option allows 
you to create a list of blocked and approved websites, and tries to filter out 
adult websites (which won’t always be successful). You’ll need to click the 
Customize button to define a list of websites that are always approved and 
websites that are always blocked, as shown in Figure 20-6.
>
>
Allow access to only these websites  This option allows access only to a 
list of approved websites.

Restricting Access to Other People
With Internet access, your child could potentially exchange emails and instant 
messages with anyone in the world, including unsavory characters who should be 
imprisoned as soon as possible. To protect your child from contacting untrust-
worthy strangers, you can define a list of approved email and instant messaging 
contacts using the Mail and iChat programs. (However, your child can still use 
other email programs or web-based email accounts or use other instant messag-
ing programs.) To restrict Mail and iChat use, do the following:
1.	
Follow the steps in “Setting Parental Controls” on page 164 to open the 
Parental Controls window (see Figure 20-3).
2.	
Click the People tab.
3.	
Select or clear the Limit Mail and Limit iChat checkboxes, as shown in 
Figure 20-7.
4.	
Click the plus button to add an approved name to the account’s email and 
iChat list. A dialog appears, as shown in Figure 20-8.
5.	
Click in the First Name and Last Name text boxes and type a name.

Click Add. The dialog disappears, returning you to the Parental Controls 
window.
8.	
Select the Send permission requests to checkbox.

Type your own email address in the text box to the right. Now you’ll receive 
an email every time the Managed with Parental Controls account user tries to 
contact someone who isn’t on your approved list.

Setting Time Limits for Using the Macintosh
Blocking access to certain websites or email addresses can be helpful, but you may 
also want to block access to your entire Macintosh during certain times of the day, 
such as at night or on the weekends. For example, you might want your kids to use 
your Macintosh only for an hour right after school, but not any time after dinner 
when they should be doing their homework.
Here’s how to define time limits:
1.	
Follow the steps in “Setting Parental Controls” on page 164 to open the 
Parental Controls window (see Figure 20-3).
2.	
Click the Time Limits tab, as shown in Figure 20-9.
3.	
Select or clear the Limit computer use to checkbox under the Weekday 
time limits and Weekend time limits categories. If you select the Limit com-
puter use to checkbox, drag the slider to define how much time the person 
can spend on your Macintosh.
Figure 20-9: The Time Limits tab lets you restrict the amount of time 
or the specific times an account user can use the Macintosh.

Chapter 20
4.	
Select or clear the School nights and Weekend checkboxes under the 
Bedtime category. If you selected either of these checkboxes, you’ll have to 
specify a time range when the account user cannot access the Macintosh.
5.	
Click the close button of the Parental Controls window.
Restricting Other Features
Believe it or not, the built-in dictionary on your Macintosh contains definitions for 
profanity, so if you don’t want your child to look up four-letter words, you can block 
these words from appearing in the dictionary.
You can also restrict CD/DVD burning, printer administration, and whether 
the user can change the password or not. 
Here’s how to restrict the miscellaneous features available to a Managed 
with Parental Controls account:
1.	
Follow the steps in “Setting Parental Controls” on page 164 to open the 
Parental Controls window (see Figure 20-3).

Additional Ideas for Using Managed with 
Parental Controls Accounts
Parental controls aren’t just for children. If you are teaching someone to use the 
Macintosh, for example, and you don’t want that person messing up your com-
puter settings, you can set up a Managed with Parental Controls account for that 
person and let him or her use the Simple Finder along with a limited list of pro-
grams. With a limited choice of options, novices can learn to use the Macintosh 
safely without getting overwhelmed by the variety of options normally available.
Managed with Parental Controls accounts can also come in handy if you want 
to limit your own computer use on the weekends or at night. If you (or your spouse) 
think you’re spending too much time on the computer, set limits for yourself so 
you’ll know when it’s time to stop.
Parental controls can help restrict what others can do on your Macintosh, but 
remember that actual supervision and self-restraint will be far more productive in 
the long run. In the absence of that, parental controls can help you keep an eye on 
how people are using your Macintosh when you’re not around to watch.

If you have trouble seeing, hearing, or using 
your Macintosh, a variety of accessibility fea-
tures can help make text easier to read or the 
keyboard and mouse easier to use. No matter 
what your physical limitations, you’ll find that 
using a Macintosh is easier than using any other 
computer.
Project goal: Turn on special access fea-
tures to make your Macintosh easier to use.

Chapter 21
What You’ll Be Using
To make your Macintosh easier to see, hear, or control, you’ll be using the following:
>
>
The System Preferences program
>
>
The Finder program
Enlarging Text on the Screen
If you have a large screen, text and icons may look tiny because your Macintosh 
tries to display as much information as possible. If you have a hard time reading 
your Mac’s text, you can increase the font size. Another way to enlarge icons and 
text is to zoom in, which enlarges the screen like a magnifying glass.
Increasing the Font Size
In case you find text on your screen too small to read comfortably, many programs 
allow you to customize the text size.
In the Finder, you can magnify text by doing this:
>
>
From the Finder menu, choose ViewShow View Options. This displays a 
View Options palette, which allows you to choose a Text size and Icon size for 
viewing information in the Finder window, as shown in Figure 21-1.
In Safari, you can magnify text on the screen by doing this:
>
>
From the Safari menu, choose ViewZoom In (or Zoom Out).
>
>
Press -+ (Bigger) or -− (Smaller). This shortcut is common and works in 
many other apps, too. 
>
>
Pinch two fingers out on the trackpad.
Figure 21-1: The View Options palette displays different choices 
depending on the view (Icon, List, Column, or Cover Flow) you choose.

>
>
Press -+ (Bigger) or -− (Smaller).

>
Pinch two fingers out on the trackpad.
Magnifying the Screen
Magnifying temporarily enlarges the screen. There are two ways to use this feature: 
using a mouse or trackpad, or using the keyboard. To zoom in right now, use the 
scroll wheel in combination with the control key. Zoom back out by scrolling in the 
opposite direction while holding the control key. If you’re using a trackpad, zoom 
in by scrolling up and down with two fingers, plus control. 
If you’d prefer to use a keyboard shortcut instead, you just need to enable it 
in the System settings.

Replacing Beeps with Screen Flashing
Normally your Macintosh beeps to attract your attention. If you have difficulty 
hearing (or are using your Macintosh in a noisy environment), you might prefer 
replacing a beeping noise with a flashing screen.
To make your Macintosh flash the screen instead of beeping to get your 
attention, do the following:
1.	
Click the Apple menu and choose System Preferences. A System Prefer-
ences window appears.

Click the close button of the Universal Access window.
Turning On Sticky Keys
The Sticky Keys feature lets you use keyboard shortcuts by pressing one key at a 
time. For example, most keyboard shortcuts involve pressing multiple keys simul-
taneously, such as option--= to magnify the screen. Using Sticky Keys, you can 
press these same keys sequentially, making it easier to choose the command with-
out stretching your fingers on the keyboard.
Here’s how to turn on Sticky Keys:
1.	
Click the Apple menu and choose System Preferences. A System Prefer-
ences window appears.
2.	
Click the Universal Access icon under the System category. A Universal 
Access window appears (see Figure 21-2).

such as pressing  and then O rather than pressing  and O at the same 
time (-O).
5.	
Click the close button of the Universal Access window.
Q
Q Note: To help make the keyboard even easier to use, the Keyboard tab 
includes additional options such as beeping every time you press a modifier 
key (like the option or control key), letting you adjust the delay before the 
keyboard starts repeating a character, or inserting a delay between the time 
you press a key and the time the computer accepts it.
Using the Keyboard to Control the Mouse 
Pointer
If you find the mouse too cumbersome, you 
can control the pointer on the screen using 
a feature called Mouse Keys, which lets you 
control the mouse through the numeric 
keyboard, as shown in Figure 21-5. Press-
ing each number key moves the pointer in 
a different direction. Pressing the 5 key is 
equivalent to clicking the left mouse but-
ton, while pressing the 0 key is equivalent to 
holding down the mouse button, which can 
be used with other numeric keys to mimic 
dragging the mouse.
Here’s how to use Mouse Keys to con-
trol the mouse using the numeric keypad:
1.	
Click the Apple menu and choose 
System Preferences. A System Pref-
erences window appears.
2.	
Click the Universal Access icon under the System category. A Universal 
Access window appears (see Figure 21-2).
3.	
Click the Mouse & Trackpad tab, as shown in Figure 21-6.

Click the On radio button in the Mouse Keys category.
5.	
(Optional) Select (or clear) the Press the Option key five times to turn 
Mouse Keys on or off checkbox.
6.	
(Optional) Drag the Initial Delay slider. This determines how much time 
passes after you press a key on the numeric keypad before the pointer starts 
moving.
7.	
(Optional) Drag the Maximum Speed slider. This determines how fast the 
pointer moves when you press a key on the numeric keypad.

Additional Ideas for Using Universal Access 
Features
Your Macintosh’s Universal Access features can also be useful for helping nov-
ices use a Macintosh. For example, if a user has trouble using the mouse, turn on 
Mouse Keys so that the user can point and click using the numeric keypad instead. 
While slower than clicking the mouse, pressing keys to move the pointer can often 
be easier for novices to understand and control.
Give your eyes a break and magnify the screen. With a wireless keyboard and 
mouse, you can then control your Macintosh from any comfortable distance away 
from your computer screen.
Universal Access can make any Macintosh faster, easier, and more comfort-
able to use, so fiddle with the different Universal Access features and see which 
ones help you.
Figure 21-6: Turning on the Mouse Keys feature lets you control the 
pointer through the numeric keypad.

The safest way to buy and install software for 
your Macintosh is through the Mac App Store, 
because Apple verifies that any software posted 
on the Mac App Store does what it claims and 
isn’t a virus or other malicious software. 
To use the Mac App Store, you need an

Searching for a Program
The Featured, Top Charts, and Categories icons at the top of the Mac App Store 
give you different ways to browse for a program. If you happen to know all or part 
of the program name you want, it may be faster to simply search for that name 
instead.
To search for a program by name, do the following:
1.	
Start the Mac App Store (click the App Store icon on the Dock, etc.).
2.	
Click in the Search field that appears in the upper-right corner of the Mac 
App Store window.
3.	
Type all or part of the program name you want to find (such as elem) and 
press return. The Mac App Store window displays a list of programs that 
match your search criteria, as shown in Figure 22-4.
Q
Q Note: The more of the program name you type, the fewer irrelevant pro-
grams the Mac App Store window will display.
4.	
(Optional) Click the Sort By pop-up menu to choose a way to sort the dis-
played programs by a different criterion, such as Release Date or Most Popu-
lar, as shown in Figure 22-5.
5.	
Click the close button at the far right of the Search field to clear the search 
criteria.
Figure 22-3: The Categories screen displays programs organized into 
related groups, such as Business or Entertainment.

Downloading Programs
Browse through the Mac App Store and you’ll find different types of programs that 
you may never have found otherwise. After you’ve found an app you like, download 
it by following these steps.
1.	
Click the program you want to download. Information about that program 
appears in the Mac App Store window, as shown in Figure 22-6.
2.	
Click the price button, which will either read Free or display a price such as 
$2.99. The price button turns into an Install App button.
3.	
Click the Install App button. A sheet appears, asking for your Apple ID 
password to verify your download and charge your iTunes account if you 
have chosen a paid program.   
4.	
Type your Apple ID password in the Password text field and click the Sign 
In button. Your Macintosh downloads your chosen program—this might take 
a few minutes. Once the download is complete, you can double-click the 
program icon in the Applications folder or switch to Launchpad and click 
the program icon on the Launchpad screen to run your new app.

Additional Ideas for Using the Mac 
App Store
The Mac App Store can be a safe place to browse through different types of pro-
grams until you find the one that you want. But you don’t necessarily have to pur-
chase programs through the Mac App Store.
Click a program and you’ll see a link that can take you to the developer’s 
website, where you can read more about that particular program or download a 
trial version so you can verify that the program does what you need. 
If you find a program that you might need, don’t download it just yet. Check 
out the reviews to see what other people think—and don’t forget to search the 
Mac App Store to find rival programs. By using the Mac App Store you can choose 
the program that works best for you.
Figure 22-6: The Mac App Store window displays information about a 
particular program.

23
The safest and simplest way to add new pro-
grams to your Macintosh is through the Mac 
App Store (see Chapter 22). However, you can 
still install programs directly from a website or 
from an installation CD or DVD.
Since your Macintosh is only as useful as 
the software it can run, you need to know how 
to install programs, update them, and uninstall 
and get rid of them if necessary, which you’ll 
learn about in this chapter.
Project goal: Learn how to install, update, 
and uninstall software on your Macintosh with-
out relying on the Mac App Store.

What You’ll Be Using
To install, update,  and uninstall software on your Macintosh, you’ll use the 
following:

The Finder program
>
>
The Software Update program
>
>
A software program
>
>
The System Preferences program

An Internet connection
Installing Software from a CD or DVD
You can install software on your Macintosh in two different ways: by copying a pro-
gram into the Applications folder on your hard disk or by using a separate installer 
application that copies a program to your Applications folder automatically. The 
method that you’ll use will depend on the program you’re installing.
Q
Q Note: You can store programs anywhere on your Macintosh. However, it’s 
a good idea to store all programs in the Applications folder so you’ll always 
know where to find them. 
If you purchased a program on a CD or DVD, when you insert that disc 
into your computer, a program icon appears in a Finder window, as shown in 
Figure 23-1.
To install the program, you have two choices:
>
>
Drag the program icon over the Applications folder that appears in the side-
bar of the Finder window (not all Finder windows may display the sidebar).
>
>
Drag the program icon over the Applications folder displayed in the Finder 
window.
Other times, you may see an installer application icon, as shown in Fig-
ure 23-2. When you see an installer application icon, you must double-click it so 
it will store the program in your Applications folder for you.
Installing Software over the Internet
Although many stores sell packaged Macintosh software, you’ll find a much greater 
variety of software by searching the Internet.
Q
Q Note: Selling software in stores is expensive. The software publisher needs 
to pay for a CD or DVD and a pretty box, and then it sells the product to a 
distributor who then sells and ships it to a store. By selling software directly 
over the Internet, software publishers save money, so they may pass the sav-
ings on to you by offering a discount if you buy and download their programs 
over the Internet.

	
Installing, Updating, and Uninstalling Software	
|	 189
When you buy software over the Internet, the software publisher can send 
you a CD/DVD containing the program, but more than likely you’ll download the 
program online, typically as a compressed (shrunken) file.
The most common way for people to compress Macintosh software is as 
a disc image file, often abbreviated as a .dmg file since that’s the extension that 
appears on the file, as shown in Figure 23-3.
After you download a .dmg file, it may automatically start its installation. If 
this does not happen, then you’ll need to double-click the .dmg file to start install-
ing the program.
Figure 23-1: To install a program, you may be prompted to drag a 
program icon into the Applications folder.
Figure 23-2: Many programs use an installer application icon that you 
must double-click to install the program in the Applications folder.

Chapter 23
To install a program stored as a .dmg file, do the following:
1.	
Double-click the .dmg file (or click the .dmg file and select FileOpen). A 
device icon appears on the desktop, along with a window displaying the 
contents of the .dmg file, as shown in Figure 23-4. The device icon appears 
as a separate storage device and contains the contents of the disc image file.
2.	
At this point, you can install the program either by dragging its program icon 
into the Applications folder or by double-clicking the installation application 
icon, if one exists.
3.	
After you install the program, drag the device icon to the Trash or click it and 
select FileEject to remove the device icon.

Q
Q Note: After you install a program, keep the .dmg file in a safe place. That way 
you’ll have it if you need to reinstall the program later.
Updating Apple’s Software
Most software publishers release improvements to their programs frequently, 
and each may have its own way of providing these updates. Sometimes programs 
will automatically display a dialog, informing you of an update. If you purchased a 
program through the Mac App Store, you can update those programs through the 
Updates icon. 
To make updating Apple’s software (Mac OS X and iLife) and common 
drivers for printers and other accessories easy, Apple provides a simple update 
feature.
Q
Q Note: Minor updates to a program are usually free. Major updates to a pro-
gram usually cost money.
Here’s how to update Apple’s software:
1.	
Make sure that you’re connected to the Internet.
2.	
Click the Apple menu and choose Software Update. A Software Update 
dialog appears, listing all the available updates for your Apple programs, as 
shown in Figure 23-5.
Figure 23-5: The Software Update dialog lists 
all available updates to your Apple programs.

3.	
Select the checkboxes of the software updates you want to install, and 
uncheck those that you don’t want.
Q
Q Note: You don’t necessarily need every software update, especially those 
intended for programs you never use.
4.	
Click Install x Items. After installing certain updates, you may be asked to 
restart your Macintosh.
Checking and downloading software updates periodically can get tedious. 
To automate this process, you can tell your Macintosh to check for updates, which 
it can do if you have an Internet connection (via a DSL, cable, or other fast connec-
tion; this will not work if you use a dial-up Internet connection). Here’s how to tell 
your Macintosh to check for updates automatically:
1.	
Click the Apple menu and choose System Preferences. A System Prefer-
ences window appears.
2.	
Click the Software Update icon under the System category. A Software 
Update window appears, as shown in Figure 23-6.
3.	
Select (or clear) the Check for updates checkbox. After you select this 
checkbox, click the Check for updates pop-up menu and choose Daily, 
Weekly, or Monthly.
4.	
Select (or clear) the Download important updates automatically 
checkbox.
5.	
Click the close button of the Software Update window.
Figure 23-6: The Software Update window lets you define how 
often your Macintosh should check for the latest software updates.

Q
Q Note: To update non-Apple software, you may need to visit the software 
publisher’s website periodically or look for a Check for Updates command 
buried in a Help menu or program menu, as shown in Figure 23-7.
Uninstalling Software
The Macintosh makes uninstalling software as simple as dragging a file or folder 
icon into the Trash. Here’s how to uninstall a program:
1.	
Click the Finder icon on the Dock. A Finder window appears.
2.	
Click the Applications folder in the sidebar of the Finder window. The con-
tents of the Applications folder appear in the right pane.
3.	
Move the mouse over the program file or folder and drag it over the Trash 
icon on the Dock. (You can also click a program file or folder and then select 
FileMove to Trash.)
Q
Q Note: Make sure you really want to uninstall a program before you trash it! 
Once you dump the Trash, it’s not coming back.
Additional Ideas for Installing Software
After you install software on your Macintosh, always store the original CD or DVD 
that contains the program in a safe place. That way, if your hard disk crashes or 
your Macintosh fails, you can always reinstall the program.
When you download programs from the Internet, keep a copy of those pro-
grams (the .dmg disc image files) in a safe place, such as a special folder on your 
hard disk as well as on a CD or DVD (in case your hard drive fails).
You may never have to reinstall a program after you’ve installed it, but when 
you get a new Macintosh or accidentally uninstall a program, a spare copy of your 
programs and registration keys can make sure you can reinstall your programs and 
get up and running as quickly as possible.
Figure 23-7: Many non-Apple programs offer a Check 
for Updates command hidden somewhere in a menu.

You may know plenty of people, but chances 
are good that you don’t memorize their contact 
information but may still need it occasionally. 
In the old days, you could just collect business 
cards or jot down names on a Rolodex card, but 
with your Macintosh, you can use an electronic 
version of a Rolodex file called Address Book.
As the name implies, Address Book can 
be handy for storing names and addresses, 
but it can also store telephone numbers, email 
addresses, and any other information you need 
to contact someone by whatever method they 
prefer best. If you find yourself needing some-
one’s crucial information regularly but want 
something more durable than a paper Rolodex 
file (which could get lost), start storing informa-
tion in Address Book today. 
Project goal: Learn how to store informa-
tion in Address Book.

Chapter 24
What You’ll Be Using
To learn how to save names and addresses on your Macintosh, you’ll use the 
following:
>
>
The Address Book program
Storing Contacts
Address Book is designed for storing names and different types of contact infor-
mation such as street addresses, multiple phone numbers, and email addresses. 
However, you can also store other types of information such as birthdays, website 
addresses, or practically anything else you wish to store about a person. 
The left side of the Address Book window displays a list of all your stored 
contacts, while the right side of the Address Book window displays contact infor-
mation for a single person. This is referred to as a card since it acts like a single 
paper card in a Rolodex file.
To store information in Address Book, do this:
1.	
Click the Address Book icon on the Dock. (If you don’t see the Address 
Book icon on the Dock, click the Finder icon on the Dock, click Applications 
in the sidebar of the Finder window, and then double-click the Address 
Book icon.) The Address Book window appears, as shown in Figure 24-1. 
2.	
Click the plus button, select FileNew Card, or press z-N to create a new 
card. Address Book creates a No Name generic name in your list of contacts 
and displays a blank card for adding new contact information, as shown in 
Figure 24-2.

(Optional) Click the Delete button 
(a white dash inside a red circle) to

7.	
Click the Done button. 
Editing a Card
After you’ve stored information in Address 
Book, you may need to edit that information 
occasionally, such as changing someone’s 
phone number or email address. You may 
also need to add new information, which 
means creating a new field and giving it a 
descriptive label. To edit a card, do this:
1.	
Start Address Book. 
2.	
Click the name you want to edit. Address Book displays that person’s contact 
information in the right side of the Address Book window.
3.	
Click the Edit button.

(Optional) Click in any text field to modify the existing text.
5.	
(Optional) Click the Delete button (a white dash inside a red circle) to

Click the Done button. 
Deleting a Card
You may want to delete an entire card to wipe someone’s name and contact infor-
mation completely off your Macintosh.
To delete a card, do this:
1.	
Start Address Book. 
2.	
Click the name you want to delete. 
3.	
Select EditDelete Card. A dialog appears, asking if you really want to 
delete your card.

Saving Contact Information	
|	 199
Searching for a Name (and Other 
Information)
After you’ve stored some names and contact information, you can easily search for 
any information stored in Address Book. For example, if you want to find a person 
by name, you can search for that person’s name. If you want to find someone who 
lives in Idaho, you can search for all contact information that contains the word 
Idaho.
You don’t even need to type a complete word because as you type, Address 
Book starts matching all the cards that contain the information you’ve typed so far. 
So if you start typing Id to search for Idaho, Address Book will show you a list of 
cards that contain the word Idaho as well as Idiot and Idiom.
To search for any information stored on a card, do this:
1.	
Start Address Book. 
2.	
Click in the Search field that appears at the top of the left side of the 
Address Book window. (You may need to select ViewList and Card to 
display the Search field.)
3.	
Type a word that you want to find in the Search field. Address Book displays 
a list of cards that match your search criteria in the left side of the Address 
Book window. 
Figure 24-5: The Add Field submenu displays new fields you can add to 
a card.

4.	
Click a listed name. Address Book highlights the information it matched to 
your search criteria, as shown in Figure 24-6.
5.	
Click the close button at the far right of the Search field to display a list of all 
names stored in Address Book.
Creating Groups
Address Book can theoretically store thousands of names and their contact infor-
mation. Of course the more names you store, the harder it can be to find any par-
ticular name. While searching can help, Address Book offers another option, called 
groups.
The idea behind groups is to organize related names together such as the 
names of all people related to work, just family members, or people who owe you 
money. Address Book creates a default group called All Contacts, which displays 
all names stored in Address Book. 
When you create additional groups, each group simply shows you a subset 
of your entire Address Book. If you make any changes to data displayed in one 
group, those changes automatically appear throughout Address Book. Groups can 
help you find the names you want when you need them.
Creating and Filling a Group
When you create a group, you need to give it a descriptive name and fill it with 
contacts. To create a group, you have two options. First, you can create a new 
group and then fill it with contacts. Second, you can search for the contacts you 
want to store in a group, and then create a group to hold the contacts that match 
your search criteria.
Figure 24-6: Address Book highlights text that matches your search 
criteria.

	
Saving Contact Information

To create a new group and then fill it with contacts, do this:
1.	
Start Address Book. 
2.	
Select FileNew Group. An untitled group appears in the left side of the 
Address Book window, as shown in Figure 24-7.
3.	
Type a descriptive name for your group and press return.
4.	
Click the All Contacts group. The right side of the Address Book window 
lists all your stored contacts.
5.	
Click a contact that you want to store in your newly created group. (If you 
hold down the z key, you can click and select multiple names.)
6.	
Drag and drop your selected contact(s) over your newly created group in the 
left side of the Address Book window.
The second way to create a group is to start by selecting your contacts first 
like this:
1.	
Start Address Book. 
2.	
Click the All Contacts group. The right side of the Address Book window 
lists all your stored contacts.
3.	
Click a contact that you want to store in your newly created group. (If you 
hold down the z key, you can click and select multiple names.)

Chapter 24
Creating a Smart Group
One problem with creating groups is that when you add new contacts to Address 
Book, you must manually add them to any groups they belong to. Any time you 
have to do something yourself, there’s a good chance you’ll forget, and thus cer-
tain groups may not be up to date.
To solve this problem, you can create a smart group. Basically a smart group 
lets you define certain criteria and then any new contact you add that matches that 
criteria automatically gets stored in your smart group.
To create a smart group, do this:
1.	
Start Address Book. 
2.	
Select FileNew Smart Group. A dialog appears for you to name your 
smart group and define the criteria for storing contacts, as shown in 
Figure 24-8.
3.	
Type a descriptive name for your smart group.
4.	
Click the Card pop-up menu and choose an option such as Name or 
Company, as shown in Figure 24-9.
Figure 24-8: Creating a smart group
Figure 24-9: Choosing criteria for your smart group

	
Saving Contact Information	
|	 203
5.	
Click the contains pop-up menu and choose a criterion such as contains or 
does not contain.
6.	
Click in the text field and type the criteria you want to use. For example, if 
you only want names from a certain company, you would type the company 
name here. 
7.	
(Optional) Click the plus button to define another rule.
8.	
Click the OK button. Now as you add new contacts to Address Book, the 
smart group will automatically store any relevant contacts.
Deleting a Group
Chances are good that you’ll create a group and later decide you don’t need that 
group anymore. When you delete a group, you do not delete any individual con-
tacts; just the group name.
To delete a group, do this:
1.	
Start Address Book. 
2.	
Click the name of a group that you want to delete.
3.	
Select EditDelete Group. A dialog appears, asking if you really want to 
delete your group.
4.	
Click the Delete button. (If you change your mind, select EditUndo 
Delete Group.)
Changing Your View
After you’ve created new groups and new contacts, you might get confused as to 
what exactly you’re looking at. To switch between viewing a list of groups and a list 
of names within a group, just tap the Red Bookmark icon (see Figure 24-1). You 
can also navigate using the View menu and choose one of the following:
>
>
List and Card  Displays names within a single group, where a list of names 
appears on the left side and contact information for the currently selected 
name appears on the right side.
>
>
Card Only  Displays contact information for a single name.
>
>
Groups  Displays a list of all groups available.
Additional Ideas for Using Address Book
After you have stored someone’s contact information in Address Book, you can 
open Address Book and right-click a label (such as Phone or Email) to display a 
pop-up menu that lets you choose an option such as Send Email or FaceTime, as 
shown in Figure 24-10.
If you choose the Send Email option, the Mail program loads and displays a 
new message with that person’s email address already typed in. If you choose the 
FaceTime option, the FaceTime program loads and tries to contact that person.

204	 |	
Chapter 24
If you want to share a name and contact information with others, click the 
Share button that appears at the bottom of each page of contact information. 
This loads Mail and stores the entire Address Book card as a vCard file, which is a 
universal file format that other contact management programs can import (such as 
Microsoft Outlook). 
If you have contact information stored in another program, export it as a vCard 
or text file. Then, open Address Book and select File4Import to open an Import 
dialog, which is where you can select the file to import data into Address Book.
Figure 24-10: Right-clicking a field label brings up options for con-
tacting that person.

Everyone is busy (although not everyone 
is focused on productive activities that will 
achieve a useful goal, but that’s another story 
altogether). When you have meetings or other 
types of appointments to plan in your sched-
ule, you could rely on a day planner (which 
you could lose) or you could use iCal on your 
Macintosh instead.
With iCal, you can view your appointments 
at a glance so you can see which days you have 
free and which days you’re busy. More impor-
tantly, you can also use iCal to remind you of 
upcoming appointments so you don’t miss one 
unless you really want to.

Making Appointments in Your Calendar	
|	 207
The Day and Week views are the only views that display hours, so they’re 
best suited to spotting open periods of time within your days. The Month view 
is best for long-range planning because you can see which days you might be busy 
or free. The Year view is useful for simply seeing which dates have appointments in 
the future, but you won’t be able to see any details without switching to the Day, 
Week, or Month view.
Making an Appointment
When you have an appointment, you need to define the date and time. You can 
also specify the estimated length of time and the location of that appointment as 
well as other information, such as a reminder of materials to bring or people who 
should be there. 
To store an appointment in iCal, do this:
1.	
Start iCal.
2.	
Choose a view for your calendar such as Day or Week (if you want to see 
your available times) or Month (if you want to do long-range planning).
3.	
In the Day or Week view, click and drag the mouse to define the time block 
you want to schedule your appointment in. In the Month view, just double-
click inside a day that you want to schedule an appointment in. iCal displays 
a New Event in the displayed calendar.
4.	
Type a description for your appointment 
and press return. Your appointment now 
appears in iCal.
Q
Q Note: If you want to create an appointment 
for the current day, click the plus button in 
the upper-left corner of the iCal window to 
display a Create Quick Event window, as 
shown in Figure 25-2. Type a description of 
your appointment and iCal will store it on 
the current day.
Modifying an Appointment
After you’ve stored an appointment in iCal, you may want to move it to a new time 
or date, modify its duration, or add more details. To move an appointment to a 
new time or date, just drag and drop the appointment to a new position on the 
calendar. (Create an appointment and try it now!)
To edit an appointment, do this:
1.	
Start iCal.
2.	
Click the appointment you want to edit.
3.	
Select EditEdit Event or press z-E. An Edit window appears, as shown in 
Figure 25-3.

Deleting an Appointment
If an appointment is canceled, you’ll probabbly want to delete it from your calen-
dar. To delete an appointment, do this:
1.	
Start iCal. 
2.	
Click the appointment you want to delete. 
3.	
Select EditDelete. (If you change your mind, select EditUndo Delete 
Event.)
Creating Reminders
Sometimes you may need to schedule a task or remember something but not 
necessarily tie it to a specific date or time. For example, if you’re losing weight or 
trying to study for a class, you may want to remind yourself to exercise or study but 
not necessarily define a fixed time to do it. 
Rather than cover your computer monitor in scolding sticky notes, you can cre-
ate something called a reminder instead. A reminder lets you create a list of tasks 
or items that you can check off and define with a priority such as High, Medium, 
Low, or None. By creating reminders, you can make sure you don’t forget any cru-
cial information.
To create a reminder, do this:
1.	
Start iCal.
2.	
Select ViewShow Reminders. The Reminders list appears on the right 
side of the iCal window.
3.	
Select FileNew Reminder or double-click in the Reminders list. A New 
Reminder appears in your Reminders list, as shown in Figure 25-4.
4.	
Type a description for your reminder and press return.
Figure 25-4: The Reminders list displays a generic New Reminder.

Modifying a Reminder
In many cases, you can just type a descriptive reminder so you can see what you 
need to do every time you open iCal. However, you may want to add more detail 
to your reminder.
To edit the details of a reminder, do this:
1.	
Start iCal.

Deleting a Reminder
Reminders often have a limited lifespan. When you’re done with a reminder, you 
can delete it by doing this:
1.	
Start iCal. 
2.	
Select ViewShow Reminders. The Reminders list appears on the right 
side of the iCal window.
3.	
Click the reminder you want to delete.
4.

Reminder.)
Using Different Calendars
If you have a paper calendar, you may notice how quickly it gets cluttered with all 
your various appointments related to work, your personal life, and your kid’s activi-
ties. To avoid cluttering iCal with numerous appointments, you can create multiple 
calendars, such as a Work calendar and a Home calendar.
Creating a New Calendar
You can create as many different calendars as 
you wish. Then you can selectively store differ-
ent appointments on each calendar so you can 
view all your appointments at once, or selec-
tively hide certain types of appointments, such 
as those related to work or home. 
To create a new calendar, do this:
1.	
Start iCal. 
2.	
Select FileNew Calendar. A new cal-
endar name appears under the Calendars 
button, as shown in Figure 25-6.
3.	
Type a descriptive name for your calendar 
and press return.
Viewing Appointments on Different Calendars
When you create multiple calendars, you can selectively hide and display appoint-
ments stored on each particular calendar. To choose which calendars to show or 
hide, do this:
1.	
Start iCal. 
2.	
Click the Calendars button in the upper-left corner of the iCal window, 
or select ViewShow Calendar List. A list of all your available calendars 
appears under the Calendars button, as shown in Figure 25-7.

Select the checkbox of any calendar whose appointments you want to view. 
iCal hides or displays appointments based on which calendars you select 
and clear.
Deleting a Calendar
At any time, you can delete a calendar. Just be aware that when you delete a cal-
endar, you also delete any appointments and reminders stored on that calendar. 
To delete a calendar, do this:
1.	
Start iCal. 
2.	
Click the Calendars button in the upper-left corner of the iCal window, 
or select ViewShow Calendar List. A list of all your available calendars 
appears under the Calendars button (see Figure 25-7).
3.	
Right-click the calendar you want to delete. A pop-up menu appears.
4.	
Choose Delete. A dialog appears, asking if you really want to delete your 
calendar.
5.	
Click Delete. (If you change your mind, select Edit4Undo Delete Calendar.)
Additional Ideas for Using iCal
The most obvious use for iCal is to keep track of your appointments, but using 
iCal’s reminder feature, you can type in the birthdays of important people and pro-
gram iCal to send you a reminder automatically in advance. That way you’ll never 
forget a birthday, anniversary, or other special event.
Figure 25-7: A list of all available calendars.

	
Making Appointments in Your Calendar	
|	 213
If you’re trying to establish a new habit (or break an old one), set up iCal to 
remind you periodically, such as once a week. For example, you could have iCal 
pop up a message every Friday, asking if you’re sticking to your diet or staying 
away from smoking. 
For even more fun, track statements and predictions from people you don’t 
like (politicians, your boss, etc.) and store them in iCal. Now you’ll have a time 
record of when they said something stupid so you can remind others about this 
whenever the time seems appropriate. You can even use iCal to keep track of poli-
ticians’ promises and then have iCal display a message a year later, reminding you 
to check up on whether they actually kept their promise. 
If you have appointment information stored in another program, export it 
as a text file. Then open iCal and select File4Import to open an Import dialog, 
which is where you can select the file to import data into iCal. To further help you 
track your appointments, consider getting an iPhone or iPad so you can synchro-
nize your appointments between your Mac and iPhone or iPad. That way you’ll 
always have your schedule with you when you need it.
With iCal, you can turn your Macintosh into a virtual assistant to remind 
you of upcoming events. Rather than trying to remember every minor and major 
appointment you need to keep, spend your free time doing more productive tasks 
and let iCal do the remembering for you.

Since people read and write in different lan-
guages, you may need to write in languages as 
diverse as Arabic and Vietnamese (or dozens of 
other languages) on your Macintosh. While lan-
guages such as French and Italian use some of 
the same characters used in English, languages 
such as Japanese and Korean do not.
Fortunately, your Macintosh lets you type 
special characters, such as é or ë, or com-
pletely foreign characters, such as Chinese or 
Japanese characters. Best of all, you can type 
these characters and words in practically any 
text-based program without requiring special 
keyboards or additional software.
Project goal: Learn how to type foreign 
characters and words in any Macintosh 
program.

Typing Foreign Characters
Many languages share the English alphabet but use accents over or under some 
characters to indicate specific pronunciations. Although most keyboards don’t 
display these accented characters, you can still type them by pressing keyboard 
combinations, such as those shown in Table 26-1.

Clicking to Choose Foreign Characters
Another way to add special characters to text is to view a list of characters and 
click the one you want. If you need to type characters in a language based on the 
Roman alphabet (such as French, Spanish, or Italian), for example, you need to 
display and use the Character Viewer.
Adding the Character Viewer to the Language & Text Menulet
To use the Character Viewer, you need to enable the Language & Text menulet on 
the right side of the menu bar and then turn on the Character Viewer:
1.	
Click the Apple menu and select System Preferences. A System Prefer-
ences window appears.

218	 |	
Chapter 26
2.	
Click the Language & Text icon under the Personal cateogry. The Language & 
Text window appears.
3.	
Click the Input Sources tab.
4.	
Select the Keyboard & Character Viewer checkbox, as shown in Fig-
ure 26-1. The Character Viewer appears on the Language & Text menulet on 
the right side of the menu bar as a flag icon.
5.	
Click the close button of the Language & Text window.
Choosing Characters with the Character Viewer
After you’ve added the Character Viewer to the Language & Text menulet, you can 
open or display the Character Viewer by doing the following:
1.	
Move the cursor where you want to insert the character (in a word processor 
document, for example).
2.	
Click the Language & Text menulet on the right side of the menu bar and 
select Show Character Viewer. The Character Viewer appears, as shown in 
Figure 26-2.
3.	
Click Latin in the left pane. The right pane displays all accented characters 
based on the Roman alphabet.
Figure 26-1: The Language & Text window lets you choose languages 
and display the Character Viewer.

4.	
Double-click the character you want to use to insert it at the current location 
of the cursor.
5.	
Click the close button of the Character Viewer.
Typing on a Foreign Language Keyboard 
Layout
Pressing keyboard shortcuts or clicking characters in the Character Viewer can be 
useful for occasionally adding foreign characters to text. However, if you need to 
type multiple foreign language characters, a foreign language keyboard layout 
may offer a much simpler solution.
A foreign language keyboard layout assigns foreign characters to ordinary 
keys on the keyboard. By using the Keyboard Viewer, you can see which keys on 
the keyboard can be used to type foreign language characters.
Choosing a Foreign Language
Before you can type foreign language characters using the foreign language key-
board, you need to tell your Macintosh which foreign language you want to use:
1.	
Click the Apple menu and select System Preferences. A System Prefer-
ences window appears.
2.	
Click the Language & Text icon under the Personal category. The Language & 
Text window appears.

6.	
Click the close button of the Language & Text window.
Typing in a Foreign Language
After you’ve defined one or more foreign languages to use on your Macintosh, you 
can type in those languages in any Macintosh program, such as a word processor.
Here’s how you switch to and type in a foreign language:
1.	
Start any program that can accept text, such as the TextEdit program. The 
program window appears.
2.	
Click the Language & Text menulet that appears on the right side of the 
menu bar. A pull-down menu of your chosen languages appears, as shown 
in Figure 26-3.
3.	
Click one of the languages listed in the pull-down menu, such as French or 
Portuguese.
4.	
Click the Language & Text menulet and click Show Keyboard Viewer. The 
Keyboard Viewer window appears to show you which keys to press to type 
certain characters, as shown in Figure 26-4. (You can also click the characters 
in the Keyboard Viewer window to “type” the characters.)
5.	
Use the keyboard to type the corresponding foreign characters displayed in 
the Keyboard Viewer window.
Figure 26-3: The Language & Text menulet 
displays all your selected foreign languages.

Typing in Foreign (Non-Roman) Characters
To type in languages that use non-Roman characters, such as many Asian lan-
guages like Chinese or Japanese, you must choose an input method that lets you 
type a Chinese or Japanese word using the Roman alphabet on a typical keyboard. 
After you’ve chosen an input method, you need to know how to type the words 
that your chosen input method recognizes.
For example, the Pinyin input method is common for representing traditional 
Chinese words as Western alphabet characters, such as typing wo to represent 
the Chinese character 我.
Choosing an Input Method
Asian languages often use multiple input methods, so you must choose the one 
with which you’re most familiar, such as Pinyin for typing traditional Chinese char-
acters. Here’s how to choose an input method:
1.	
Click the Apple menu and select System Preferences. A System Prefer-
ences window appears.
2.	
Click the Language & Text icon under the Personal category. The Language & 
Text window appears.
3.	
Click the Input Sources tab (see Figure 26-1).
4.	
Select the checkbox of the language you want to use (such as Simplified 
Chinese, Traditional Chinese, or Japanese). 
5.	
Click the close button of the Language & Text window.
Typing Using a Foreign Language Input Method
After you’ve chosen an input method for a language, you will use that input 
method to start typing the foreign language characters by doing the following:
1.	
Start a text program, such as TextEdit, and move the cursor where you want 
to type the foreign characters.
2.	
Click the Language & Text menulet and choose the input method for your 
foreign language, such as Pinyin for traditional Chinese (see Figure 26-3).
Figure 26-4: The Keyboard Viewer window displays 
the layout of your foreign language keyboard.

222	 |	
Chapter 26
3.	
Type a word, using ordinary Western alphabet characters, that represents 
the foreign language word you want to choose.
4.	
Press the spacebar. A menu appears, listing possible characters from which 
you can choose. Figure 26-5 shows the Chinese characters that appear 
when you type wo.
5.	
Click the character you want to “type” into the document or press the arrow 
keys and spacebar (or the return key) to choose a character.
Writing Chinese Characters by Hand
At first glance, Chinese words may look like a random jumble of lines, but once 
you get familiar with the language, you may want to write characters by hand. To 
do this on a Macintosh, you need a trackpad such as the built-in trackpad on a 
laptop or the Magic Trackpad for a desktop. By sliding your finger on the surface 
of a trackpad, you can draw Chinese characters with your fingertip. 
To draw a Chinese character, do this:
1.	
Start a text program, such as TextEdit, and move the cursor where you want 
to type a Chinese character.
2.	
Click the Language & Text menulet and choose Show Trackpad 
Handwriting. The Trackpad Handwriting window appears.
Figure 26-5: Typing in many Asian languages often requires 
typing equivalent words on a standard keyboard and choos-
ing the actual symbol from a pull-down menu.

3.	
Slide your finger on the trackpad to draw a character, as shown in Figure 26-6. 
As you trace a character, the right side of the Trackpad Handwriting window 
displays a list of likely characters.
4.	
Tap on the right side of the trackpad to choose the correct Chinese charac-
ter to type. 
5.	
Press control-shift-spacebar to make the Trackpad Handwriting window 
disappear.
Additional Ideas for Typing Foreign 
Characters
Many people are familiar with languages that are written left to right. However, 
many other languages are normally written from right to left, such as Arabic and 
Hebrew. To type in these languages, you may like to use a special word processor 
such as Nisus Writer (http://www.nisus.com/) or Mellel (http://www.redlers.com/) 
that allows right-to-left typing.
As an alternative, you can configure the free TextEdit program that comes 
with your Macintosh to type right to left. Here’s how to use TextEdit to type right 
to left:
1.	
Click the Finder icon on the Dock. The Finder window appears.
2.	
Click Applications in the sidebar of the Finder window. The contents of the 
Applications folder appear in the right pane of the Finder window.
3.	
Double-click the TextEdit icon. The TextEdit window appears.
4.	
Select FormatTextWriting DirectionRight to Left.
Now that you know how to type in different languages, try writing and send-
ing an email message to a friend or relative overseas. Writing in a foreign language 
can be easy and fun, and that’s what using the Macintosh is all about.

writing window lets you draw an

Part 4
Playing Music 
and Movies


27
To make your Macintosh even more enjoyable 
to use, you can play music while you type let-
ters, browse the Internet, or read your email. 
The old-fashioned way to play music is to insert 
an audio CD into your Macintosh and play the 
whole thing from start to finish. If you’re slowly 
advancing to the modern age, you might have 
music stored as audio files so you can play 
songs by several different artists. 
If you’ve collected music as digital audio 
files, you can organize your favorite songs in 
categories called playlists. Then you can pick 
the playlist you want to hear, such as rock songs 
released before 1995, love songs, or songs by 
a particular recording artist. Whether you want 
to hear music stored on audio CDs or as digital 
files, you can turn your Macintosh into a home 
entertainment sound system.

For more flexibility, you can shuffle the audio tracks to hear them in a ran-
dom order or just play the good songs and skip the rest.
Project goal: Learn how to play audio CDs and audio files on your Macintosh.
What You’ll Be Using
To play audio CDs and files on your Macintosh, you’ll use the following:

An audio CD
Playing Audio CDs
If you want to play music stored on an audio CD, do the following:
1.	
Start the iTunes program. (Click the iTunes icon on the Dock or double-click 
the iTunes icon in the Applications folder.)
2.	
Insert the audio CD into your Macintosh’s CD/DVD drive. If you’re connected 
to the Internet, iTunes will identify the album name and individual audio 
files in the iTunes window, as shown in Figure 27-1. (If you are not connected 
to the Internet or if iTunes can’t find the track names, you’ll see generic track 
listings, such as Track 4 or Track 8.)
3.	
(Optional) A dialog may appear, asking if you want to import the entire audio 
CD into iTunes (see Figure 27-1). Click No. 
4.	
Click the Play button in the upper-left corner of the iTunes window or press 
the spacebar to play the audio tracks in order.
Figure 27-1: The iTunes window can identify a CD audio tracks by

>
Press -E.
>
>
Click the Eject icon that appears to the right of the audio CD name in the 
sidebar of the iTunes window.
Adding Digital Audio Files to iTunes
You can cram hundreds of songs (as digital audio files) on a single hard disk. But 
before you can play any of these digital audio files in iTunes, you’ll first have to add 
them into iTunes. Adding digital audio files simply stores them in an iTunes folder 
so the iTunes program can find them.
If you want to convert audio CD tracks into digital audio files, see “Ripping 
Songs off an Audio CD” on page 242. The simplest way to add MP3s or other 
digital audio files to iTunes is to simply drag them from the Finder into the open 
iTunes window. You can also use a command in iTunes like this: 
1.	
Start iTunes.
2.	
If the files aren’t already on your computer, insert the device that contains 
your digital audio files (such as a USB flash drive or data CD/DVD) into your 
Macintosh.
3.	
In iTunes, select FileAdd To Library. An Add To Library dialog appears, as 
shown in Figure 27-2.
Figure 27-2: You choose which digital audio files to store in 
iTunes from the Add To Library dialog.

4.	
Click the digital audio file you want to add. (You can hold down the  key 
and click multiple files to select several digital audio files at once, or you can 
add an entire folder of digital audio files.)
5.	
Click the Open button.
Deleting Digital Audio Files in iTunes
If you previously imported an audio file into iTunes and you no longer want it 
stored there, you can delete the file. Here’s how to delete a digital audio file from 
iTunes:
1.	
Start iTunes.
2.	
Click Music under the Library category in the left pane of the iTunes window. 
Your entire collection of music appears in the right pane.
3.	
Right-click the song you want to delete and select Delete. A dialog appears, 
asking if you really want to delete the digital audio file from iTunes.
4.	
Click Remove. Another dialog appears, asking if you want to keep the digital

5.	
Click Keep Files or Move to Trash. If you click Keep Files, the digital audio 
file physically remains in the iTunes folder but won’t appear in the iTunes win-
dow. If you click Move to Trash, you’ll physically delete the digital audio file. 
Controlling Your Music
You can play your music in a variety of ways, whether the music is on an audio CD 
or from a collection of digital audio files. To play songs, simply do the following:
1.	
Start iTunes.
2.	
(Optional) Insert an audio CD into your Macintosh.
3.	
(Optional) Clear the checkboxes of the songs you don’t want to hear.
4.	
(Optional) Select ControlsShuffleBy Songs, By Albums, or By 
Groupings to scramble the order in which your songs will play.
5.	
Click the Play button in the upper-left corner of the iTunes window or press 
the spacebar. The iTunes program starts playing the song at the top of the list.
Rewinding (and Skipping) a Song
Normally iTunes plays an entire audio track from beginning to end. However, if 
you want to replay part of an audio track or move back to a previous track, you can 
rewind and play it again. You have two options for rewinding an audio track, as 
shown in Figure 27-3:

If you click the Previous button while an audio track is playing, iTunes starts 
playing that audio track from the beginning. If you click the Previous button again, 
iTunes starts playing the previous song. Dragging the audio track slider to the left 
rewinds to an earlier point in the current audio track, depending on where you 
place the slider.
If you click the Next button, iTunes jumps to the next audio track. Dragging 
the audio track slider to the right moves the current audio track forward to a later 
point in the audio file.
Q
Q Note: Click and hold the left mouse button over the Previous or Next buttons 
to rewind or fast-forward a song, respectively. 
Adjusting the Volume
Some audio CDs and digital audio files will sound louder or softer than others. You 
can adjust the volume by dragging the volume slider, which appears just to the 
right of the Next button in the upper-left corner of the iTunes window.
When you play an audio CD, all its tracks will likely play at the same volume. 
However, when you play digital audio files collected from different sources, some 
will likely sound louder or softer than others. To have iTunes adjust the playing 
volume of an individual digital audio file, do this:
1.	
Start iTunes.
2.	
Right-click a digital audio file and choose Get Info (or click a digital audio 
file and press -I). An Info window appears.

Using Playlists
As you collect more digital audio files, your audio collection can contain hundreds 
of audio tracks. To organize your audio tracks, iTunes offers playlists. You can use 
a playlist to store audio tracks based on particular criteria. For example, you might 
create a playlist that contains your favorite inspirational songs and another playlist 
that contains your favorite Beatles and Rolling Stones songs.
Creating a Playlist
You can create a playlist in two ways. You can create the playlist and then add 
songs to it, or you can select the songs you want and then create a playlist using 
those selections.
Figure 27-4: In the Options tab of the Info 
window, you can adjust the playing volume of 
individual digital audio files.
Figure 27-5: The Sound Check option 
makes iTunes automatically adjust the 
volume of all digital audio files.

Making Changes to a Playlist
After you’ve created a playlist, you’ll probably want to fill it with songs. Later, you 
can remove songs from any playlist if you want. 
Q
Q Note: A playlist contains links to digital audio files, but it does not contain 
the files themselves. When you add a song to a playlist, you’re creating a link 
to the physical file stored in the iTunes folder. When you remove a song from 
a playlist, you’re deleting the link, but the physical file stays untouched in the 
iTunes folder.
Here’s how to add a song to a playlist:
1.	
Click Music under the Library category in the left pane of the iTunes window. 
Your entire music collection appears in the right pane of the window.

Creating a Smart Playlist
When you create a playlist, you must manually add or remove songs. To automate 
this process, you can create a Smart Playlist instead. A Smart Playlist automatically 
adds and removes songs based on the criteria you define, such as “all rock songs 
that were released after 1999.”
The left pane of the iTunes window already displays some built-in Smart 
Playlists: Recently Added, Top 25 Most Played, and Recently Played. As you add 
and play different songs, these Smart Playlists automatically update their song 
collections.
Smart Playlists can automatically categorize songs by using tags, which are 
bits of information about each song. Importing songs off an audio CD automati-
cally adds tags such as the song title, recording artist, the album on which the 
song was featured, the year it was recorded, and so on. (To tag songs, iTunes 
needs to access the Internet. If you don’t have an Internet connection when you 
import a song, you’ll have to tag each song yourself. See “Tagging Your Songs” on 
page 238.)
To create your own Smart Playlists, do the following:
1.	
Start iTunes.
2.	
Select FileNew Smart Playlist. A Smart Playlist dialog appears, as shown 
in Figure 27-7.
Figure 27-7: You define the criteria for automatically adding songs to a

Additional Ideas for Playing Music on 
Your Macintosh
By playing audio CDs in your Macintosh, you can turn your computer into a simple 
sound system. For more flexibility, collect your favorite songs as digital audio files 
and store them in playlists.
Playlists let you arrange your music collection in an unlimited number of 
ways. Create a playlist of romantic music, another playlist of pounding hard rock or 
heavy metal songs you enjoy, and a third playlist of instrumentals for times when 
you want to hear music without the distraction of vocals. By using playlists, you 
can organize your music collection to uniquely reflect your personality and musical 
tastes.

Chances are good that your favorite music is 
stored on a bunch of audio CDs. Chances are 
also good that each CD probably contains only 
a handful of songs that you really want to hear 
more than once.
Rather than get stuck listening to songs you 
don’t care about, you can yank your favorite 
songs off each audio CD and store them as 
digital audio files on your Macintosh. You won’t 
have to bother fumbling with CDs when you 
can simply pick and play your favorite songs 
on your Mac instead. For those times when 
you want to listen to your music in a car, you 
can burn the songs you like to a custom CD 
collection.
The process of pulling songs off audio CDs 
and storing them on a computer is known as 
ripping. When you copy songs to a CD, you are 
burning a CD.
Ripping 
and Burning 
Audio CDs

242	 |	
Chapter 28
Project goal: Rip your favorite songs off audio CDs by importing and storing 
them in iTunes, and then burn them to a custom audio CD.
What You’ll Be Using
To rip and burn audio CDs, you’ll use the following:
>
>
The iTunes program
>
>
An audio CD
>
>
Blank CDs
Q
Q Note: The two types of blank CDs available are CD-R and CD-RW. A CD-R 
disc allows you to store data on it only once, while a CD-RW disc allows you 
to erase and reuse the disc. The CD-RW discs are more expensive and may 
not play in older CD players.
Ripping Songs off an Audio CD
Before you rip your favorite songs off an audio CD, you can decide how you want 
to store them as digital audio files. Your Macintosh can store music in five different 
file formats:
>
>
AAC  Advanced Audio Coding format, which creates small files that retain 
high-quality audio
>
>
AIFF  Audio Interchange File Format, which retains high-quality audio but 
creates large files
>
>
Apple Lossless  Format that retains high-quality audio while also reducing 
file size
>
>
MP3  Standard digital audio file format, which just about every digital audio 
player (such as an iPod) can recognize and play
>
>
WAV  Waveform digital audio file format, which retains high-quality audio 
but at the expense of large file sizes
The type of digital file format you choose depends on your goals. If you want 
high audio quality and don’t mind if your songs take up a lot of space, use AIFF or 
WAV files. If you want high-quality audio but small file sizes, choose AAC or Apple 
Lossless. If you want acceptable audio quality and small files but greater compat-
ibility with other music players, choose MP3. If you plan to play your music only on 
your Macintosh, choose the AAC digital audio file format. (You can always convert 
AAC files to MP3 files in iTunes later if you want.)
In addition to choosing a file format, you can also choose the level of audio 
quality. Be forewarned, though, that the higher the audio quality, the more space 
each song will take up on your hard disk. If you’re low on hard disk space, you 
might want to sacrifice some audio quality for smaller files. However, if you’re a 
stickler for audio quality, you’ll want to choose the highest audio quality possible.

checkmark appears in the song checkboxes that you do want to rip. 
8.	
Click the Import CD button. A dialog appears, asking if you want to send 
the CD audio information to a database that can automatically tag your 
songs with artist name and album information. (This requires an Internet 
connection.)
9.	
Click Send or Don’t Send. The iTunes program will start ripping your 
selected songs. A green checkmark appears next to each song when iTunes 
has finished ripping it.
10.	
Eject the CD by clicking the Eject icon, selecting ControlsEject Disc, or 
pressing -E.
If you’d like to rip another CD, insert it into your Macintosh and repeat these 
steps.
Burning a Custom Audio CD
Once you’ve ripped your favorite songs, iTunes stores them in your Music library. If 
you want to create a custom CD, you can arrange and burn them to an audio CD.
To burn a custom audio CD, you first create a playlist, which is a list of songs 
arranged in the order that you want to store them on the audio CD. Once you have 
created your playlist, you can burn all songs in that playlist to a CD.
Q
Q Note: Most audio CDs can store approximately 80 minutes of music.
Here’s how to burn an audio CD:
1.	
Start iTunes.
2.	
Click Music under the Library category in the left pane of the iTunes window. 
Your entire music collection appears in the right pane of the window.
3.	
Hold down the  key and click each song that you want to burn on the 
audio CD.

that you burn on your Macintosh don’t seem to play correctly on other CD 
players. If that happens, experiment with slower speeds until you find one 
that works.) 
12.	
Click a radio button in the Disc Format group, such as Audio CD or MP3 CD. 
You can choose from three types of disc formats: 
>
>
Audio CD  Stores music on a CD exactly like a store-bought audio 
CD; audio CDs can play in all CD players.
>
>
MP3 CD  Stores music on a CD as a collection of MP3 files; not all CD 
players, especially older models, can recognize and play an MP3 CD. 
>
>
Data CD or DVD  Stores music as files stored in their original digital 
audio file format, such as AAC or WAV; not all CD players can recog-
nize and play data CD discs.
13.	
(Optional) Click the Gap Between Songs pop-up menu and choose a time 
period, such as 2 seconds or none. 
14.	
(Optional) Click the Use Sound Check checkbox. If selected, this option 
adjusts the volume of all songs burned on the audio CD so that they are set 
at roughly the same level. If this option is not selected, some songs on your 
CD may end up too loud while others are not loud enough. 
15.	
Click the Burn button.

Q
Q Note: Some older CD players can’t recognize CD-RW (rewritable) discs, 
so you might want to use the less expensive and more reliable CD-R discs 
instead.
Additional Ideas for Ripping and 
Burning CDs
Although most people rip and burn audio CDs that contain music, you can rip and 
burn any type of audio, such as motivational speeches, foreign language lessons, 
or recordings of old radio shows.
By creating your own custom audio CDs, you could, for example, start off 
with your favorite song in a foreign language, follow it with a motivational speech, 
follow that with a 30-minute foreign language tutorial (in that same language), and 
end with a recording of a radio show in the foreign language you’re studying. That 
might be a nice way to create your own immersion CD for a particular foreign lan-
guage. Or try the same sort of thing for any sort of sales training or educational CD.
Custom audio CDs can also come in handy for creating your own “Greatest 
Hits” collection of songs from different albums. Put together your favorite list of 
Beatles songs or songs from the ’90s and listen to your CD the next time you have 
to drive a long way. If you’re a musician, you can paste together a CD of different 
playing styles so you can hear and learn from different recording artists.
The types of music or other audio files you can burn on a CD are endless. 
With a little bit of creativity combined with your music collection, you’re sure to 
find a way to burn custom CDs that you and others will enjoy.

Almost everyone loves watching movies and 
collecting their favorite films on DVD. In the 
old days, you had to play your DVDs in a DVD 
player hooked up to your television set. Now 
you can also play DVDs on your Macintosh, 
which can be especially handy when you want 
to keep yourself amused on the road such as 
when you’re stuck in an airport terminal.
By learning to watch DVDs on your Macin­
tosh, you can turn your computer into your own 
personal movie theater. Plug in headphones 
and you can watch movies wherever you hap-
pen to be. (If you have a Macintosh computer 
that doesn’t have a DVD drive, you can buy the 
optional SuperDrive and plug it into a Mac mini 
or MacBook Air so you can play DVDs on it.)

Additional Ideas for Playing a DVD
Chapters and bookmarks let you find and save the best parts of a movie so you can 
share your favorite scenes with others or enjoy them alone. Whether you’re a movie 
fanatic or just someone who enjoys a good show, viewing your favorite scenes from 
any movie can prove entertaining. Navigating quickly through a DVD can also be 
useful for work purposes; bookmarks make it easy to show a short video clip dur-
ing any presentation or lecture.

No matter how much you love the songs in 
your music collection, you’ll probably get tired 
of listening to the same tunes all the time. You 
could keep expanding your collection, but that 
can get expensive. No matter how much music 
you have, sooner or later you’ll crave something 
new and different. Fortunately, this problem is 
easy to solve. To hear something new, you can 
tune in to an Internet radio station.
Internet radio stations are similar to ordinary 
radio stations, except they play streaming audio 
that can be heard only through the Internet. 
Ordinary radio stations are limited in number 
because they share limited radio airwaves, but 
Internet radio stations have no such limitations. 
As a result, you’ll find an almost unlimited num-
ber of Internet stations, catering to all sorts of

tastes—whether it be Beatles music, foreign language instruction, or investing— 
24 hours a day. With such a wide variety of Internet radio stations available, you’re 
sure to hear something you like.
Many Internet and traditional radio stations feature talk shows with inter-
views of interesting guests or discussions of specific topics such as real estate 
investing or New Age thinking. Since many people aren’t able to hear these shows 
when they’re originally broadcast (either due to time constraints or because they’re 
out of range), radio stations often record their shows and store them as audio files 
known as podcasts. You can download podcasts and play them on your iPod or 
your Macintosh at your convenience. 
Project goal: Explore and listen to free Internet radio stations and podcasts 
offering everything from music and talk show interviews to inspirational speeches 
and educational seminars.
What You’ll Be Using
To listen to Internet radio stations and podcasts, you’ll use the following:
>

An Internet connection
>

The iTunes program
Finding and Listening to an Internet Radio 
Station
The iTunes program, included with every Macintosh, can play audio CDs and files 
of your favorite music. However, iTunes is more than just an audio player. When you 
connect to the Internet, you can also use iTunes to find and connect to Internet 
radio stations worldwide.
Many Internet radio stations offer commercial-free alternatives to traditional 
radio stations, so you can listen to your favorite music, from hip hop to classical, 
24 hours a day. You can also explore other music genres such as country, jazz, folk, 
dance, Latino, blues, or electronic. 
Internet radio stations also offer tons of talk shows. Whether you’re con-
servative or liberal, you can listen to talk shows geared to your particular point of 
view. You can tune in to an Internet radio station located outside the United States 
and listen to music and talk shows in nearly any language. If you need a laugh or 
two, tune in to an all-comedy Internet radio station and listen to humorous songs, 
interviews with your favorite comic, and audio clips of your favorite stand-up come-
dian’s performances. 
If you like classic rock, look for an Internet radio station that plays music 
from the ’50s or ’60s (or older if you like) so you can transport yourself to that time 
period. Some Internet radio stations even play nothing but old radio shows such as 
Buck Rogers, Hopalong Cassidy, or Amos & Andy. Some intersperse recordings of 
old radio shows with historical news broadcasts so you can hear news stories from 
the past. Relive the horror of the Hindenburg explosion or listen to the first news

broadcast announcing the sinking of the Titanic. By listening to old radio broad-
casts, you can make history come alive in ways that reading a history textbook can 
never do.

Finding Podcasts
You can access two basic types of podcasts: audio and video. Audio podcasts are 
usually recorded shows—typically, popular radio talk shows such as National Public 
Radio’s Car Talk or Fresh Air programs. However, many podcasts offer interviews or 
discussions that have never been broadcast. Others offer tutorials on topics such 
as meditation or foreign languages.
Video podcasts are like TV shows. Their length can range from a few minutes 
to an hour or more. Many video podcasts are excerpts from television shows origi-
nally broadcast on networks such as the Discovery Channel or MSNBC. Others are 
self-contained shows such as sketch comedy shows (similar to Saturday Night Live), 
motivational speeches or sermons, and tutorials for improving your Photoshop 
skills or your golf swing.
Here’s how to find an audio or video podcast:
1.	
Click the iTunes icon on the Dock, or double-click the icon in the Applica-
tions folder. The iTunes window appears.
2.	
Click iTunes Store under the Store category in the left pane of the iTunes 
window. The iTunes Store main page appears.

favorite podcast will be available every time you connect to the Internet.
Additional Ideas for Listening to Radio 
Stations and Podcasts
You can listen to your favorite talk radio show podcasts at your convenience. But 
you can do much more: how about using podcasts to learn a foreign language? 
You can visit the Language Learning category in the podcasts directory to down-
load audio podcasts of foreign language lessons. Now you can hear and learn from 
native speakers in Spanish, Chinese, Arabic, French, and Japanese, as shown in 
Figure 30-4.
Click the Video Podcasts category in the Podcasts directory and you can 
find video podcasts on a variety of topics. Video podcasts can be perfect for learn-
ing new information through both watching and hearing.

Normally, the only way to listen to college lec-
tures is to attend classes, which can be both 
expensive and time consuming. Fortunately, 
with your Mac­intosh and a copy of the iTunes 
program, both of these barriers no longer 
exist, because iTunes lets you listen to record-
ings of college lectures on a variety of topics 
from different universities. Want to learn about 
biology, sociology, computer science, or busi-
ness management? Just run iTunes and listen 
to lecture from such well-known universities 
as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology 
(MIT), Texas A&M, Stanford University, and the 
University of California, Berkeley, through a free 
service called iTunes U.

Chapter 31
Universities voluntarily record and store audio and video recordings of 
lectures on specific subjects and post these audio and video recordings in the 
iTunes Store for anyone to download, copy, and listen to or watch for free. While 
you won’t get any college credit or earn a degree, you just might get a little bit 
smarter, and you won’t have to take final exams or pay tuition. The two basic steps 
required for getting a free college education are:
1.	
Find and download a lecture from iTunes U.
2.	
Listen to your chosen lectures with iTunes.
Project goal: Use iTunes U to expand your mind by listening to free lectures 
presented by professors from universities around the world.

Additional Ideas for Listening to Lectures
With iTunes U, you get free access to some of the best minds in the country, so 
you should take advantage of this unique learning opportunity. Listening to free 
college lectures can help you learn the latest developments in a particular field, 
refresh your memory on a topic you studied previously, expose you to new ideas 
taught from someone else’s perspective, and give you an alter­native to listening to 
the same collection of digital music files over and over again. 
If you’re currently in college, listening to lectures from other professors in 
other universities can help you learn even more about a specific subject by rein-
forcing relevant concepts. If you’re not currently attending college, listening to col-
lege lectures can be a pleasant diversion to help you keep your mind active while 
you explore a new field from the convenience of your Macintosh computer.

In the old days, capturing and editing video 
was expensive. Nowadays, nearly every mobile 
phone contains a camera that can capture video 
and every Macintosh comes with a free video 
editing program called iMovie, which is part of 
the iLife suite. (If you don’t have the latest ver-
sion of iMovie, you can purchase it from the Mac 
App Store.) Even if you don’t have aspirations 
to be the next great filmmaker, chances are 
good that you have a couple of home videos 
that you just want to show off to others. 
iMovie gives you the option of editing video 
by trimming irrelevant footage or combining 
separate video clips. You can also add visual 
and audio effects and make your video look 
like a Hollywood film with scrolling titles and

movies into minor works of art, or at least something more interesting than ordi-
nary raw footage.
Project goal: Learn how to import, edit, and present a video in iMovie.
What You’ll Be Using
To learn how to edit video on your Macintosh, you’ll use the following:
>
>
The iMovie program
Transferring Video to Your Macintosh
If you have video stored on a mobile phone or camcorder, the first stepis to trans-
fer that video to your Macintosh. Most devices connect to a Macintosh through a 
cable that plugs into a port, such as the USB port. 
You can import video into iMovie from three sources:
>
>
A video camcorder or mobile phone
>
>
The built-in webcam
>
>

Capturing Video from a Webcam
Most newer Macintosh computers (except for the Mac mini and Mac Pro) have a 
built-in webcam that you can use to capture video to store and edit in iMovie. To 
capture a video from a webcam, do this:
1.	
Start iMovie.

5.	
Click the Import button.
Understanding iMovie’s Interface
To use iMovie, you have to first understand the layout of its interface. The bottom 
of the iMovie window lists video clips called events. Events typically correspond to a 
single video clip that you captured at a specific time. For example, if you captured 
a video on your iPhone of a street performer juggling on stilts and then stopped 
the camera, that would be considered one event. As soon as you start capturing 
another video, such as a clown beating up a mime five seconds later, this is consid-
ered a second event.
By clicking an event name in the bottom-left corner of the iMovie window, 
you can view the video of that event in the bottom-right corner of the iMovie win-
dow. This list of events acts like a library of different video clips that you can use to 
put together a complete video in the upper-left corner of the iMovie window.
Figure 32-6: iMovie can import an existing video file.

	
Editing Video with iMovie	
|	 271
By rearranging different events (video clips) in the upper-left corner of the 
iMovie window, called the project window, you can create your final video. As you 
arrange events, you can preview your work in the upper-right corner of the iMovie 
window.
The basic idea behind iMovie is to display a variety of video clips (events) at 
the bottom of the iMovie window, arrange these clips in the upper-left corner, and 
preview the final result in the upper-right corner. 
Once you understand the basic design of the iMovie interface, you can start 
putting together your movie.
Trimming and Selecting an Event
An event contains a video clip that you can use in its entirety or combined with 
other events to produce your complete iMovie video project. Before you use a 
video clip in a project, you may want to cut some footage from the beginning or 
end of the clip. This is called trimming. To trim an event, do this:
1.	
Click the event name that you want to trim, listed in the bottom-left corner of 
the iMovie window. 
2.	
Drag the mouse over the portion of the video clip that you want to use. 
A yellow rectangle appears over your chosen video clip, as shown in 
Figure 32-7.
3.	
(Optional) Move the mouse pointer over the left or right end of the yellow 
rectangle and drag the mouse to change the starting and ending point of 
your video clip.
4.	
Move the mouse pointer over the yellow rectangle on the video clip and 
drag and drop it over the project window in the upper-left corner of the 
iMovie window to add the trimmed clip to your project. 
To create your iMovie project, just keep importing new events (video clips), 
selecting the portions you want, and dragging them into the project window. 
Figure 32-7: A yellow rectangle defines the portion of the video clip 
to use.

Rearranging Video Clips
As you place multiple video clips in the project window, you can freely rearrange 
the order of your clips by doing this:
1.	
Click the video clip that you want to move in the project window. A yellow 
rectangle appears around the border of your entire video clip.
2.	
Move the mouse pointer over the highlighted video clip and drag it down. A 
“ghost” image of your selected video clip appears, as shown in Figure 32-8.
3.	
Drag the video clip to a new location. A green vertical line appears to let you 
know where the clip will appear when you release the mouse button.
4.	
Let go of the mouse button to drop the video clip in its new location in the 
project window.
Adding Visual and 
Audio Effects to a 
Video Clip
You can add various visual and 
audio effects to change the 
way a video clip appears or 
sounds. To choose an effect, 
do this:
1.	
Double-click the video 
clip that you want to 
modify in the project 
window. An Inspector 
window appears, as 
shown in Figure 32-9.

audio effects you can use, as shown in Figure 32-11.
5.	
Double-click an audio effect. 
6.	
Click the Done button.
Adding Transitions to a Video Clip
When you arrange video clips in the project window, iMovie will simply jump from 
the end of one video clip to the beginning of another. Sometimes this abrupt 
change can feel too jarring, so you can ease this change by using transitions. 
Transitions can be subtle, such as having one video clip fade away as a new 
video clip fades in. Sometimes transitions can be more visually interesting, such as 
having the top corner of the screen appear to peel back to reveal the new video 
clip underneath. 
To place transitions between your video clips in the project window, do this:
1.	
Select WindowTransitions. A list of different transitions appears in the 
bottom-right corner of the iMovie window, as shown in Figure 32-12.
2.	
Drag and drop a transition in between two video clips in the project window.

Adding Titles
In Hollywood movies, titles appear to display the name of the film or the names 
of the people who helped produce the film. With iMovie, you can add those same 
types of titles on your video clips as well.
To add titles, do this:
1.	
Select WindowTitles. A list of different types of titles appears in the 
bottom-right corner of the iMovie window, as shown in Figure 32-13.

share it with others by selecting the Share menu and choosing a way to share your 
movie project, such as posting it on YouTube or Facebook or exporting it as a 
video file that you can store on your hard disk.
Deleting Selections from Your Project
Eventually, your project window can display multiple video clips, transitions

Additional Ideas for Using iMovie
Most people will likely use iMovie to edit their home videos of their vacations or 
family gatherings. If you’re creative, you can use iMovie along with your camcorder 
to make a simple movie to test your filmmaking skills without spending a lot of 
money for anything beyond your camera and a Macintosh.
If you are unable to attend a business meeting to give a presentation, 
­consider filming yourself and editing your video presentation in iMovie. Then you 
can share your iMovie project with others so they can view it on a site like YouTube. 
As another alternative, store your video presentation as a video file or burn it to a 
CD/DVD so someone else can show your presentation in your absence.
iMovie can teach you the basics of film editing for free. If you enjoy editing 
video, you can learn the basics with iMovie before advancing to a professional 
video editing program like Adobe Premiere or Apple’s Final Cut. If someone like 
Steven Spielberg could get started making home movies with a Super 8 camera, 
tomorrow’s filmmakers may already be developing their skills using iMovie on a 
Macintosh.

If you have a digital camera or a scanner or if you 
see an interesting picture on the Internet, you 
can save those pictures on your Macintosh. But 
before you can store and organize pictures on 
your Macintosh, you need to know how to get 
them onto your Macintosh in the first place.
Project goal: Learn how to retrieve and 
store pictures from a digital camera, scanner, 
or web page.

What You’ll Be Using
To retrieve and store pictures on your Macintosh, you’ll use the following:
>
>
The iPhoto program
>
>
The Safari web browser
>
>
The Image Capture program
>
>
The Grab program
Transferring Photos from a Digital Camera
Many digital cameras store pictures on removable flash memory cards (with odd 
names like Compact Flash or Secure Digital). To transfer pictures, you have two 
options. One, you can just pull the removable flash card out of your digital cam-
era and plug it into a special flash card reader that plugs into a USB port on your 
Macintosh. (Some Macintosh computers come with a built-in Secure Digital card 
reader.) Your Macintosh then treats this flash memory card as just another storage 
device from which you can copy (and delete) pictures as you would any ordinary 
file. The drawback, however, is that you need to buy a separate flash memory card 
reader (which typically costs $30 or less). 
Another solution is to connect your digital camera to your Macintosh using 
a USB cable (which may or may not be included with your digital camera). Using a 
USB cable is also handy for transferring images from a smart phone such as an 
iPhone. When you connect a digital camera (or another device like a smart phone) 
to your Macintosh through a USB cable, you can import pictures directly into 
iPhoto by doing the following:
1.	
Connect your digital camera to your Macintosh using a USB cable. The 
iPhoto window appears, as shown in Figure 33-1.
Figure 33-1: The iPhoto window displays all the pictures currently 
stored on your digital camera.

2.	
(Optional) Hold down the  key and click each photo you want to import to 
your Mac.
3.	
Click the Import Selected button (or Import All). A dialog appears, asking 
if you want to delete the original photos off your digital camera, as shown in 
Figure 33-2.
4.	
Click Delete Photos or Keep Photos. Your selected pictures are now stored 
in iPhoto.
5.	
Click the eject button to the right of the digital camera icon under the 
Devices category in the left pane of the iPhoto window. (You can also right-
click on the digital camera name and choose Unmount.)
6.	
Turn off your digital camera and disconnect the USB cable.
Transferring Images from a Scanner
If you have a scanner, you can capture images from books, magazines, or old 
photo­graphs and store them on your Macintosh. To use a scanner and save an 
image to your Macintosh, you need to use the Image Capture program by doing 
the following:
1.	
Turn on your scanner and place the item you want to scan on the 
scanner bed.
2.	
Click the Finder icon on the Dock. The Finder window appears.
3.	
Click Applications in the Finder sidebar. The contents of the Applications 
folder appear. 
4.	
Double-click the Image Capture icon. The Image Capture window appears. 
5.	
Click the Scan button. The scanned image appears, as shown in Figure 33-3. 
Your selected image is automatically saved to the Pictures folder. (You may 
want to rename this file since Mac OS X just gives it a generic name like 
ScanImage001.)
6.	
Select Image CaptureQuit Image Capture.

Copying Images from a Web Page
Many websites have interesting pictures that you might want to keep. You can store 
an image from a website as a file in a folder or in iPhoto, or you can copy it so you 
can paste it into a program and use it without storing it as a separate file.
Q
Q Note: Be careful copying pictures from websites since they may be copy-
righted, which means you can’t use them without permission.
Saving a Web Page Image as a File
If you see a picture that you want to keep, you can save it as a file either in iPhoto 
or in a folder on your hard disk by doing the following:
1.	
Click the Safari icon on the Dock. (If the Safari icon is not visible on the 
Dock, double-click the Safari icon in the Applications folder.)
2.	
Right-click a picture on any web page. A pop-up menu appears, as shown in 
Figure 33-4.
3.	
(Optional) Select Save Image As to save a picture in a folder, and when 
a dialog appears, click the drive and folder where you want to store your 
picture.
4.	
(Optional) Select Add Image to iPhoto Library to store a picture in iPhoto.

Copying and Pasting a Web Page Image into Another Program
If you don’t need to save a picture as a separate file, you can copy a picture off a 
web page and then paste it directly into another program, such as an email pro-
gram or word processor, by following these steps:
1.	
Click the Safari icon on the Dock. (If the Safari icon is not visible on the 
Dock, double-click the Safari icon in the Applications folder.)
2.	
Right-click a picture on any web page. A pop-up menu appears (see 
Figure 33-4).
3.	
Select Copy Image.
4.	
Start or switch to the program in which you want to paste the picture, such as 
a graphics program or a word processor.
5.	
Select EditPaste (or press -V) to paste your copied picture.
Capturing Screen Images
Sometimes you may run across a particularly interesting web page. You could save 
the entire web page as a file, but if you only want to save part of that web page, 
you might prefer to capture a screen image of the part you want to keep. Save this 
part as a separate file and then you can print this file or email it to someone so he 
or she can see the exact image that you saw on your screen.
Figure 33-4: A pop-up menu appears with image options.

284	 |	
Chapter 33
To capture all or part of an image that appears on your screen, use the Grab 
program like so: 
1.	
Run a program or open a web page to display a message or image on the 
screen that you want to capture in an image file.
2.	
Click the Finder icon on the Dock. The Finder window appears.

Windows, Screen, or Timed Screen, as shown in Figure 33-5.
6.	
(Optional) If you choose Selection, you’ll need to drag the mouse over the 
area you want to save as a picture. If you select Window, Grab captures the 
currently active window. If you select Screen or Timed Screen, Grab cap-
tures the entire screen. (Timed Screen gives you time to modify the screen 
appearance before Grab captures the screen.)
7.	
Select FileSave. A dialog appears.
8.

Additional Ideas for Transferring and 
Storing Images
Whether you capture pictures with a digital camera or snare them off the Inter-
net using the Grab program, you can always find a way to store pictures on your 
Macintosh. The Grab program can be particularly handy to capture error messages 
so you can show people what problems you might be experiencing.
When you transfer pictures from a digital camera to your Macintosh, you 
have the option of deleting the pictures off of the digital camera, which can make 
room for more pictures. 
With the Image Capture program and a scanner, you can convert old, faded, 
or torn photographs into digital versions that you can clean up with a photo editor. 
With the right printer, you can print your digital versions of scanned photographs 
so you can create an endless supply of precious memories.
By storing pictures on your Macintosh, you’ll always be able to share, view, 
and print any type of picture, from digital photographs to scanned images of old 
photographs to images captured from your screen.
Figure 33-5: The Cap-
ture menu offers four 
different ways to cap-
ture an image off the 
screen.

If you take pictures with a digital camera, 
you can store your images on your Macintosh 
using the iPhoto program. Instead of dump-
ing pictures in a shoebox and never seeing 
them again, you can use iPhoto to browse and 
organize all your pictures so you can view them 
again and again.
Project goal: Learn how to store and orga-
nize pictures in iPhoto. (See Chapter 33 for 
information about moving pictures from your 
digital camera to your Macintosh.)

Chapter 34
What You’ll Be Using
To store and organize pictures on your Macintosh, you’ll use the following:
>
>
The iPhoto program
How iPhoto Works
iPhoto lets you store all your pictures in one place, called the iPhoto Library. While 
you can browse through the iPhoto Library to look at your pictures, it’s easier to 
view and organize the pictures based on the following categories:
>
>
Events
>
>
Photos
>
>
Faces
>
>
Places
Events represent a fixed period of time, such as one day. Using the date on 
which each picture was taken, iPhoto automatically organizes your pictures into 
events, where, for example, one event might represent all the pictures you took on 
July 24 and a second event might represent all the pictures you took on Septem-
ber 20, as shown in Figure 34-1.
Figure 34-1: The Events category organizes your digital photographs into 
groups based on when they were taken.

	
Organizing Digital Photos in iPhoto	
|	 287
Think of Events as iPhoto’s way of storing your pictures into separate piles. 
When you want to view your pictures, you can double-click an event, and iPhoto 
shows you only the pictures taken on that day.
Much like laying out all your pictures on the living room floor so you can see 
them, the Photos category lets you view and scroll through your pictures onscreen, 
so you can see every picture you have stored. However, if you have stored a lot 
of pictures and you’re looking for a particular shot, you’ll have to browse through 
each picture, one by one, until you find the one you want. In this case, one of the 
other categories would be more helpful.
Faces organizes photos by the faces that appear in each picture. So if you 
have several pictures of your uncle or your girlfriend, iPhoto can automatically 
identify and organize any picture that contains your uncle or your girlfriend’s face.
Places organizes pictures based on the location where you took them. So 
if you have pictures of a dog, a building, and a person that were all taken in San 
Francisco, iPhoto lumps those pictures together, even if your dog picture was 
taken in July 2008 and your building picture was taken in February 2012.
Working with Events
Events stores pictures based on the time when you captured them. Initially, every 
event is untitled, but to make them easier to understand, you can give them 
descriptive names. For example, you might name one event Summer Vacation 
so that you know all the pictures stored in that event came from your summer 
vacation.
Viewing the Photos in an Event
To see pictures stored in an event, do the following:
1.	
Start iPhoto. (Click the iPhoto icon on the Dock or double-click the iPhoto 
icon in the Applications folder.) The iPhoto window appears.
2.	
Click Events under the Library category in the left pane of the iPhoto win-
dow. The right pane shows all your events (see Figure 34-1).
Q
Q Note: For a quick way to view pictures stored in an event, slide the mouse 
pointer across the event from left to right. As you move the mouse pointer, 
a different picture from the event appears under the pointer. 
3.	
Double-click an event. The iPhoto window displays all the pictures stored in 
the chosen event, as shown in Figure 34-2.
4.	
Click the All Events button to return to viewing all your events as separate 
items.

288	 |	
Chapter 34
Naming an Event
Initially, events are untitled. 
To give your events a 
descriptive name, do the 
following:
1.	
In iPhoto, click Events 
under the Library cat-
egory in the left pane 
of the iPhoto window.
2.	
Move the mouse 
pointer over an event. 
The event’s name, 
such as untitled event, 
appears directly 
underneath.
3.	
Click the event name. 
A text box appears, as 
shown in Figure 34-3.
4.	
Type a name for 
your event and press 
return.

Q
Q Note: iPhoto may group your photos into too many events. To merge several 
days into a single event, select those you’d like to combine using the  key, 
then right-click and choose Merge Events.
Viewing All Your Photos
If you want to view all your pictures at once, do the following:
1.	
In iPhoto, click Photos under the Library category. The right pane of the 
iPhoto window displays all your pictures, grouped into events by horizontal 
lines, as shown in Figure 34-4.
2.	
Scroll through your pictures.
3.	
(Optional) Drag the Zoom slider in the bottom-left corner of the iPhoto win-
dow. By dragging this slider to the left (or right), you can make each picture 
appear smaller (or bigger), as shown in Figure 34-5.
Working with Faces
By using facial recognition, iPhoto can identify a person in a picture and then auto-
matically find any other pictures that contain that same person’s face. Naturally, 
this face recognition feature isn’t perfect, but it’s remarkably useful for identifying 
multiple pictures of people.
Figure 34-4: Clicking Photos under the Library category lets you view 
all your pictures at once.

290	 |	
Chapter 34
Naming Faces in a Picture
To use the Faces feature, you must identify a face in a picture and type in that 
person’s name by doing this:
1.	
In iPhoto, click a category under the Library or Recent heading (such as 
Photos or Last Import) in the left pane of the iPhoto window. The right pane 
shows you all the pictures stored in your chosen category. 
2.	
Click a picture that contains the face of a person who appears in multiple 
pictures stored in iPhoto. 
3.	
Click the Info button that appears near the bottom-right corner of the 
iPhoto window. An Info window appears.
4.	
Click Add a face under the Faces category. A white rectangle appears on 
your picture.
5.	
Resize and move this white rectangle over the face you want iPhoto to recog-
nize, as shown in Figure 34-6. (Drag the box corners to change the size of the 
box, or move the mouse pointer inside the box and drag to move the box 
over a face in the picture.)
6.	
Click the click to name text box, type the name of the person whose face is 
enclosed by the box, and press return. An arrow in a circle appears to the 
right of the name you typed.
7.	
Click the arrow to the right of the person’s name. The iPhoto window shows 
other pictures that contain that same person’s face, as shown in Figure 34-7.
Figure 34-5: Changing the size of your displayed photos lets you see 
more (or fewer) of them at once.

Finding Pictures Organized by Faces
After you’ve identified faces in your pictures, you can use the Faces category to 
find all pictures that contain the same person.
Figure 34-6: You must specify the face you want iPhoto to recognize.
Figure 34-7: After you identify a face in a picture, iPhoto tries to 
identify that face in all your other pictures.

292	 |	
Chapter 34
To view all your pictures organized by a single person’s face, do this:
1.	
In iPhoto, click Faces under the Library category in the left pane of the 
iPhoto window. Pictures of your defined faces appear against a corkboard 
image, as shown in Figure 34-8.
2.	
Double-click a face to view all the pictures where you can see that same face.
Viewing Photos with Places
Many digital cameras (including the one built in to the iPhone) contain GPS (Global 
Positioning System) information that identifies where a picture was captured. By 
using the GPS information stored in your pictures, iPhoto can identify pictures by 
the location where you captured them.
Q
Q Note: If your camera does not insert GPS information, you can add location 
information manually. See “Editing Photo Locations” on page 294.
If you go on vacation to Europe, iPhoto can identify all the pictures taken in 
Paris, London, and Berlin. Because iPhoto organizes pictures by their location, it 
can help you find a picture if you know you captured it in a certain location, such as 
in Los Angeles, Chicago, or Miami.
To view pictures organized by the location where they were captured, do this:
1.	
In iPhoto, click Places under the Library category in the left pane of the 
iPhoto window. A map appears with red pins marking the spots where you 
captured your pictures, as shown in Figure 34-9.
Figure 34-8: The Faces category displays pictures of faces you’ve 
identified.

2.	
Click a red pin. The location of your pin appears with an arrow in a circle to 
the right of its location name.
3.	
Click the arrow that appears to the right of the location name. iPhoto dis-
plays all pictures captured in that area.
Q
Q Note: If you click the Satellite or Hybrid buttons in the upper-right corner of 
the iPhoto window, you can view a satellite image of your map with or with-
out identifying names, as shown in Figure 34-10.
Figure 34-9: Red pins identify where you captured a picture.
Figure 34-10: The Hybrid option lets you view your map as a 
satellite image with identifying names.

Chapter 34
Editing Photo Locations
The Places feature of iPhoto can identify where you captured certain pictures. 
However, if your camera didn’t automatically include location information or if you 
scanned an image, your picture may not have any location information. To fix this 
problem, you can manually add location information to any picture by doing this:
1.	
In iPhoto, view a picture you want to add a location to. (To view a picture, 
click Events or Photos under the Library category in the left pane of the 
iPhoto window, or click an album under the Albums category.) 
2.	
Click a picture. 
3.	
Click the Info icon at the bottom-right corner of the iPhoto window. An Info 
window appears on the right, listing information about your chosen picture, 
as shown in Figure 34-11.
4.	
Click the Assign a Place text field and type a location to assign to your pic-
ture. A list of standardized locations appears. 
5.	
Click the location you want. A map appears, displaying the location you’ve 
assigned to your picture, as shown in Figure 34-12.

them over the Trash icon in the left pane of the iPhoto window).
4.	
(Optional) Right-click the Trash icon in the left pane and select Empty Trash 
to delete your pictures for good.
Q
Q Note: If you don’t empty the Trash, you can retrieve a picture from the Trash 
by dragging it back over Events or Photos under the Library category in the 
left pane of the iPhoto window.
Q
Q Note: Any pictures stored in the Trash still take up space on your hard disk, 
so empty the Trash to delete pictures you’re sure you won’t need.
Additional Ideas for Organizing Digital 
Photos in iPhoto
Events, Photos, Faces, and Places give you four different ways to organize and view 
pictures in your iPhoto Library. One practical way to use iPhoto is to store pictures 
of your house and possessions, such as big-screen TVs, stereos, and computers. By 
taking pictures of your house and possessions, you’ll have a photographic inven-
tory of your home in case a disaster strikes and you need to file an insurance claim. 
(Just make sure you back up your iPhoto pictures, or else any disaster wiping out 
your house will likely take out your Macintosh at the same time. Ideally, back up your 
photos on a storage site on the Internet, one that offers a fixed amount of storage 
space for free or a nominal monthly fee.)


35
The iPhoto program is handy for storing and 
organizing pictures, and it can also sort pic-
tures. You can tag images with titles, keywords, 
or ratings so you’ll be able to search for and 
find any image stored in your collection of digi-
tal photographs.
For example, you can tag a picture of your 
dog with the keyword Rover so whenever you 
want to find a picture of Rover, you can just 
search for the keyword. You can also rate your 
pictures from zero to five stars, so if you want 
to show off your best (five-star rated) pictures, 
iPhoto can help you find and display them in 
an instant.

Chapter 35
What You’ll Be Using
To tag and sort digital pictures on your Macintosh, you’ll use the following:
>
>
The iPhoto program
Tagging Photos
You can tag each picture with a title (any name you want to give a picture), a rating 
(from one star to five stars), and a keyword (to identify a category for your picture). 
By tagging pictures with titles, ratings, or keywords, you can quickly find all your 
pictures displayed in alphabetical order by name, all your five-star pictures, or 
all pictures tagged with keywords, such as Birthday or Vacation.
When you first upload an image, your Macintosh uses the generic filename 
created by your digital camera, such as DSC_048. Since trying to find a picture 
based on a generic filename can be difficult, if not impossible, take time to rename 
picture titles, define a rating, and type keywords for each picture.
To view titles, ratings, and keywords, select the View menu, and then select 
Titles, Rating, or Keywords to place a checkmark next to the item, as shown in 
Figure 35-1. If a checkmark does not appear in front of Keywords, for example, 
iPhoto won’t display keywords for any of your pictures.
Figure 35-1: The View menu lets you choose to show or hide your pictures’ 
titles, ratings, and keywords.

Renaming a Photo
A picture’s title can be any descriptive name you choose. A title can identify the 
subject of the picture, the location where the picture was taken, the event that the 
picture captured, or any arbitrary name you choose.
To change a picture’s title, do the following:
1.	
In iPhoto’s View menu, make sure a checkmark appears in front of the 
Titles item.
2.	
View a picture you want to rename. (To view a picture, click Events or Photos 
under the Library category in the left pane, or click an album under the 
Albums category.)
3.	
Click the image title. A text box appears with the title highlighted.
4.	
Type a new title or press the arrow and delete keys to edit the existing title.
Rating a Photo
To identify your best pictures, you can rate them with one to five stars. To rate a 
picture, do the following:
1.	
In iPhoto’s View menu, make sure a checkmark appears in front of Rating.
2.	
View the picture you want to rate. (To view a picture, click Events or Photos 
under the Library category in the left pane, or click an album under the 
Albums category.)
3.	
Right-click a picture. A window appears, as shown in Figure 35-2.
4.	
Click the number of stars you want to rate the picture. The highest rating is 
five stars, which you can choose by clicking the fifth star from the left. The 
lowest rating is zero stars.

Number represents the number of stars you want to rate a picture. So if you 
click a picture and press -4, for example, you would give that picture a four-
star rating.
Adding Keywords to a Photo
Keywords let you identify common types 
of pictures, such as vacation or birthday 
pictures. You can type keywords directly 
into the keywords text box, much like 
editing a picture’s title. 
Q
Q Note: To avoid spelling typos, use the

For more flexibility in tagging and sorting pictures by keyword, tag a pic-
ture with multiple keywords so you can find it in different ways. For example, use 
keywords that evoke specific emotions, such as Happy, Freedom, or Melancholy. 
Then tag pictures using keywords that describe specific events or places, such 
as Reunion (to identify pictures involved with family reunions) or Europe (to iden-
tify pictures taken in Europe). By using multiple keywords for each picture, you’ll 
always have multiple ways to find your pictures again—whether you want an image 
that evokes a certain emotion, captures a certain event, or shows a certain area or 
place.
Half of the fun of digital photography is the freedom to take pictures and 
keep only the good images. The other half of the fun is using iPhoto to organize 
and sort your pictures so you’ll always be able to find them again.

Even expert digital photographers sometimes 
capture images that are not quite perfect—they 
are a shade too dark or slightly overexposed. 
Rather than toss out less than perfect digital 
photos, you can make them better by editing 
them with iPhoto.
You can use iPhoto to rotate or straighten 
out images, remove blemishes, lighten or darken 
images, or even add unique visual effects such 
as making a photo­graph look old and faded 
like an antique.

The iPhoto program
Rotating and Straightening Photos
Sometimes you’ll need to tilt your camera sideways to capture an image, or you 
might have captured an image that’s slightly crooked. You can straighten out both 
types of issues by doing the following:
1.	
In iPhoto, view the picture you want to edit. (To view a picture, click Events, 
Photos, Faces, or Places under the Library category in the left pane, or click 
an album under the Albums category.)
2.	
Click a picture you want to edit and click the Edit button at the bottom of 
the iPhoto window. The iPhoto window displays editing tools, as shown in 
Figure 36-1.
3.	
If the image appears sideways, click the Rotate button to rotate the image 
counter-clockwise. (Hold down the option key while clicking the Rotate but-
ton to make the image rotate clockwise.)

changes only before you click the Done button. 
Cropping a Photo
You might capture a great image that contains a bit too much of the background. 
To make it easier to see the subject of your photo, you can crop it, which means 
selecting just the part of the picture you want to keep and deleting everything else 
around it.
To crop a picture, do the following:
1.	
In iPhoto, click a picture you want to crop, and click the Edit button at the 
bottom of the iPhoto window so that editing tools appear (see Figure 36-1).

Additional Ideas for 
Editing Digital Photos 
in iPhoto
Nobody takes perfect photos all the time 
(including professional photographers), so 
iPhoto’s editing features let you rescue mar-
ginally acceptable pictures and turn them 
into perfect ones. Take the time to fix your 
pictures and people will think you’re a better 
photographer than you really might be.
For fun, experiment with visual effects 
and turn a photo of your newest car into a 
faded, black-and-white image that looks like 
it was taken in another era. Play with other 
visual effects and turn ordinary portraits of 
people into more interesting images with 
blurred edges and other unique touches. With digital photography and iPhoto, 
you can make practically any picture worth saving, even those containing peo-
ple you don’t like.
Figure 36-6: The Adjust win-
dow provides sliders so you 
can adjust several aspects of 
an image.

Most people display pictures on their desk 
inside picture frames or hung on the wall as 
posters. The problem is that an ordinary picture 
frame or poster can get boring after a while—it 
always shows the same picture until you replace 
it with another one.
Rather than force yourself to deal with such 
archaic display technology, you can store and 
display pictures on your Macintosh screen. By 
turning your Macintosh into an electronic pic-
ture frame, you can display the same image 
or multiple images one after another in a 
slideshow.

Displaying Your Pictures on the Desktop
Every Macintosh displays an image on the screen known as the desktop. To make 
the desktop more interesting, you can choose the image that appears there. 
Although Apple provides a library of images you can use, you can use your own 
pictures as well. You can display a single image all the time or have your Macintosh 
randomly display all the images in a certain folder, one at a time.
To display several pictures on your desktop, do this:
1.	
Click the Apple menu and choose System Preferences. The System Prefer-
ences window appears.
2.	
Click the Desktop & Screen Saver icon under the Personal category. A 
Desktop & Screen Saver window appears.
3.	
Click the Desktop tab, as shown in Figure 37-1.

folders stored on your Macintosh.
5.	
Click the folder that contains all the pictures you want to display and click the 
Choose button. (To create a folder of images for this purpose, see “Creating 
a Special Picture Folder” below.) The Desktop & Screen Saver window dis-
plays all the pictures stored in your chosen folder.
Q
Q NOTE: If you want to display only one image on your desktop, click a single 
picture from the folder displayed in the Desktop & Screen Saver window.
6.	
(Optional) Select the Change picture checkbox and click its pop-up menu 
to define how often to change pictures, such as every 30 or 15 minutes. Now 
as you use your Macintosh, a different picture will appear as your desktop 
background periodically.
7.	
Click the close button of the Desktop & Screen Saver window.
Using Your Pictures as a Screensaver
Besides displaying your pictures on the desktop, you can also use your pictures as 
a screensaver. After a fixed amount of time passes without a keystroke or mouse 
movement, your Macintosh can start displaying a slideshow screensaver. To cus-
tomize your screensaver, follow these steps:
1.	
Click the Apple menu and choose System Preferences. The System Prefer-
ences window appears.
2.	
Click the Desktop & Screen Saver icon under the Personal category. A 
Desktop & Screen Saver window appears.
3.	
Click the Screen Saver tab, as shown in Figure 37-2.
4.	
Click the plus button. A sheet appears, displaying the folders stored on your 
Macintosh.
5.	
Click the folder that contains all the pictures you want to display and click the 
Choose button. (To create a folder of images for this purpose, see the next 
section, “Creating a Special Picture Folder.”) The Desktop & Screen Saver 
window displays all the pictures stored in your chosen folder one at a time, 
so you can see how they will appear when your screensaver turns on.
6.	
Click the close button of the Desktop & Screen Saver window.
Creating a Special Picture Folder
If you want to display only certain pictures on your desktop or screensaver, you 
should store them in a separate folder by following these steps:
1.	
Click the Finder icon on the Dock. The Finder window appears.
2.	
Click the Pictures folder in the sidebar of the Finder window. The Finder 
window displays the contents of the Pictures folder.

Additional Ideas for Displaying Pictures
Most people are likely to display pictures of the family dog or their spouse and 
children, and be happy with that. If this sounds too tame for you, get more creative 
and try some of the following ideas.
Gather some pictures of other people and store those pictures as your 
screensaver. That way, whenever you walk away from your desk and your Macin-
tosh’s screensaver kicks in, your boss, co-workers, spouse, roommate, or kids can 
watch themselves flashing across the screen. (Just make sure those pictures aren’t 
embarrassing!)
Take some pictures of yourself, and then surprise a friend or relative by 
displaying those pictures on his or her Macintosh, either on the desktop or as a 
screensaver. The next time that person uses his or her Macintosh, they’ll see you 
staring or waving right back at them. 
Instead of storing ordinary digital pictures in your slideshow folder, put 
together your own artwork or modified digital images using a digital editing pro-
gram such as the free Paintbrush program (http://paintbrush.sourceforge.net/).
If you’re studying a foreign language, gather pictures of different items and 
type the English word and its equivalent foreign word for each picture. When your 
Macintosh starts running the slideshow, you can use these digital flash cards to 
help you study and review.
The same principle can be used for work as well. You can create graphical 
images of tasks you need to complete that day or goals you want to achieve. When 
your slideshow starts, your Macintosh can remind you of your to-do list or help you 
review your goals so you’ll remember them and stay focused and motivated.
By turning your slideshow into more than just a picture frame, you can use 
your Macintosh as a learning tool, limited only by your own imagination and sense 
of humor.

Most new Macintosh computers (except for the 
Mac mini and Mac Pro) include a built-in web-
cam a little bit like a cyclop’s eye. One use for 
this built-in webcam is to take pictures of your-
self using a program called Photo Booth.
The Photo Booth program icon looks a 
lot like the curtain you would close in a coin-
operated photo booth, and that’s the idea. 
No quarters are required for these photos, 
though—you’ve already spent many hundreds 
of quarters to buy your Mac. You can take still 
and video images using Photo Booth and save 
these still images or videos as files. 
Project goal: Take pictures of yourself with 
Photo Booth and your Mac’s built-in webcam.

Additional Ideas for Using Photo Booth
Photo Booth can be fun for parties where people can take silly pictures of them-
selves and save them for posterity. However, a more practical use for Photo Booth 
can be for people who hate typing.
Record a video of yourself in Photo Booth and then click the Email icon that 
appears in the bottom-left corner of the Photo Booth window. Clicking the Email 
icon attaches your video to an email message so you can send it to someone. Now 
you can send video messages to people so they can see your face and hear your 
voice. If you can talk faster than you can type, using Photo Booth to send email 
messages can make communicating easier for everyone. If you want to chat face-
to-face with your friends and family, skip ahead to Chapter 48.

Surfing and 
Sharing on 
the Internet


39
Your Macintosh may be great for playing 
games, drawing pictures, listening to music, 
or watching movies. But at some point, you’ll 
probably want to browse the Internet, down-
load programs and updates, or share your files 
with others. To do this, you need to get on the 
Internet.
The two most common ways of getting 
online are plugging a cable into your Macintosh 
or connecting through a wireless (Wi-Fi) net-
work. As a general rule, wired networks (that is, 
connecting a cable to your Macintosh) will be 
faster and more reliable, but wireless networks 
are far more convenient. In this chapter, you’ll 
learn how to use both methods.
Project goal: Learn how to connect your 
Macintosh to the Internet and share your fold-
ers with people on your network.
Getting on the 
Internet and

Chapter 39
What You’ll Be Using
To connect to the Internet and share your folders, you’ll use the following: 
>
>
The System Preferences program
>
>
The Network Diagnostics program 
>
>
The Safari web browser
Connecting to the Internet 
The old-fashioned way of connecting to the Internet involves a special plug called 
an Ethernet port, which looks like an oversized telephone jack. 
To connect your Macintosh to the Internet using Ethernet, you’ll need a high-
speed Internet connection through your cable or telephone company, such as a 
Digital Subscriber Line (DSL). Next, you’ll need a cable or DSL modem, which plugs 
into the cable or DSL line. Finally, you need an Ethernet cable that connects your 
modem to your Macintosh, as shown in Figure 39-1.
If you have multiple computers, you can use a device called a router, which 
plugs into your modem and provides multiple Ethernet ports so several comput-
ers can share the same cable or DSL connection, as shown in Figure 39-2. Wireless 
routers work the same way—just without the hassle of cables. 
After you have plugged in and turned on your modem and router, you’ll be 
able to connect to the Internet. The simplest way to test if you’re online is to simply 
start Safari and visit a website. If you’re not connected, Safari provides a link to 
Apple’s Network Diagnostics tool. 
Testing Your Ethernet Connection
After you’ve purchased service from an Internet service provider (ISP), and plugged 
in and turned on your modem and router, you should be able to surf the Web, send 
email, and much more.
To test if your Internet connection is working through an Ethernet cable, 
do this:
1.	
Click the Safari icon on the Dock. The Safari window appears. You should 
see a web page, but it may just be a web page you viewed the last time you

click the Continue button. Follow the directions on the Network Diagnostics 
dialog, which will guide you through troubleshooting the problem with your 
Internet connection.
5.	
Click the close button of the Network Diagnostics dialog when you want to 
make it go away.
Connecting to a Wireless Network
Rather than connect an Ethernet cable from your DSL or cable modem to your 
Macintosh, you can connect your modem to a wireless router, which sends out 
signals that any wireless-equipped computer or phone can access. (For security, 
many Wi-Fi networks require a password for access, which can keep strangers from  
leeching off your wireless Internet connection, reading your email, or knowing 
what websites you visit.) 
Here’s how to connect: 
1.	
Click the Apple menu and choose System Preferences. The System Prefer-
ences window appears.
Figure 39-4: The Network Diagnostics dialog can help you trouble­
shoot your Internet connection. The list on the left can tell you

network you want to use. If the Wi-Fi network requires a password, a dialog 
will appear, letting you type the password.
6.	
Click the close button on the Network window.
7.	
Click the Safari icon on the Dock and load a new web page. If you cannot 
load a web page, there is a problem with your Wi-Fi connection and you’ll 
see an error message (see Figure 39-3). You’ll need to click the Network 
Diagnostics button and then follow the instructions to troubleshoot your 
Wi-Fi connection (see Figure 39-4).
8.	
(Optional) Click the Wi-Fi menulet in the menu bar to switch to a different 
wireless network quickly, as shown in Figure 39-6. When you’re traveling, this 
lets you see if any wireless networks are available at a glance.

Chapter 39
Q
Q Note: Public wireless networks, such 
as those provided by coffee shops and 
airports are not the right place to email 
passwords, send confidential memos, or 
do any online banking. Wait until you’re 
back home or at work and on a secured 
wireless or wired network to conduct 
any sensitive business. For the truly 
paranoid, you can completely disable 
Wi-Fi via the menulet while traveling so 
you don’t accidentally connect to any 
untrusted networks. 
Sharing Folders over a Network
If you have a bunch of Macintosh computers hooked up to the same router, you 
have a simple network. When you have such a network connected together, either 
physically through Ethernet cables or wirelessly through a Wi-Fi router, you can 
freely share files between your computers.
To make your Macintosh share files with other Macintosh computers on the 
same network, you need to do the following:
>
>
Turn on File Sharing
>
>
Define which folders you want to share from your Macintosh
These two steps simply make your folders visible to other Macintosh com-
puters on your network. Those other computers can then access files in those 
specified folders through the Finder window, essentially treating the folders on 
another computer as if they were physically part of that particular Macintosh.
To share folders from your Macintosh, do this:
1.	
Click the Apple menu and choose System Preferences. The System Prefer-
ences window appears.

Q
Q Note: If you share folders and connect to a Wi-Fi network, your shared fold-
ers will be accessible to anyone also connected to that Wi-Fi network. That 
means if you connect your laptop to a public Wi-Fi network at a coffeehouse 
or a library, anyone else using that Wi-Fi connection will be able to access 
your shared folders.
Additional Ideas for Connecting to the 
Internet
Other ways to connect to the Internet include using a USB cellular modem. This 
device plugs into a USB port and lets you access the Internet through a cellular 
phone network. Naturally, you’ll need to pay for this privilege, but if you need 
Internet access at all times, this can get you on the Internet wherever you can find 
cellular phone coverage from your phone company.
A similar method relies on tethering, which essentially means connecting 
your mobile phone to your Macintosh and connecting to the Internet through your 
mobile phone. This will also cost you extra, but if you regularly travel with a mobile 
phone and a laptop Macintosh, it’s another option to ensure you can get on the 
Internet practically anywhere you receive a cellular signal.
Finally, you can always buy an antiquated telephone modem that plugs into 
your computer’s USB port. These old-fashioned modems then plug into an ordi-
nary telephone line and let you access the Internet through a telephone line and 
an account with an Internet provider that offers dial-up access. 
Figure 39-8: The Shared category in the Finder window treats shared 
folders on other computers as additional storage devices.

	
Getting on the Internet and Sharing Folders

With so many options for getting on the Internet, there’s no reason why your 
Macintosh cannot get connected to the rest of the world. If you don’t feel like pay-
ing for monthly Internet access, just take your laptop to the nearest public library 
and latch onto their free public Wi-Fi network.
After you connect to the Internet, you can use Safari to browse websites, 
Mail to send and receive messages, and iChat to chat with your friends in real time. 
Some of Dashboard’s widgets rely on a live Internet connection to retrieve infor-
mation like stock prices and weather forecasts.
With a little creativity (or money), there’s no reason you can’t get on the 
Internet today. Now you just have to figure out what you want to do on the Internet 
once you get your Macintosh hooked up to it.

To visit a website, you can either type the web-
site address (such as http://www.nostarch.com/) 
into a browser or use a search engine (such as 
Google) to find a list of websites that you can 
try. Unfortunately, both methods can be time-
consuming. To save time, you can use Safari’s 
bookmarks and history list to help you find and 
visit websites that you visited at some earlier 
point in time.
Bookmarks let you store your favorite 
­website addresses as descriptive names that 
you can click to open the sites. The history list 
keeps track of all the websites you’ve visited 
recently so you can easily find a previously 
viewed website.
Project goal: Learn different ways to view 
previously visited websites.

What You’ll Be Using
To keep track of websites you’ve visited, you’ll use the following:
>
>
The Safari web browser
>
>
An Internet connection
Viewing Previously Visited Websites
As you’re browsing different websites, you might want to go back and revisit a 
website you viewed a few minutes (or days) ago. Safari offers three ways to go back 
to a website you’ve visited before. You can:
>
>
Use the History menu.
>
>
View thumbnail images of previously viewed websites.
>
>
View thumbnail images and lists of previously viewed websites.
Using the History Menu
The History menu displays a list of the websites you’ve visited in the past week. To 
view the History menu, do this:
1.	
Open the Safari web browser. 
2.	
Click the History menu. A list of all the websites you’ve visited today appears 
along with submenus of websites you’ve visited in the past several days, as 
shown in Figure 40-1.
3.	
Click the name of the website you want to view again. Your chosen website 
appears.
Figure 40-1: The History menu displays submenus of websites you’ve 
visited, organized by date.

Viewing Thumbnail Images of Previously Visited Websites
The History menu displays a list of previously viewed websites by name. However, 
if you can’t recognize the name of a particular website, you might prefer trying to 
look for a previously viewed website by its visual appearance. Flipping through 
thumbnail images of your recently visited websites can often be easier and faster 
than trying to remember the particular name of a website you want to view again.
To view thumbnail images of previously visited websites, do this:
1.	
Open the Safari web browser. 
2.	
Click the Top Sites icon in the upper-left corner of the Safari window, or 
select HistoryShow Top Sites. Thumbnail images of websites appear 
(you’ll learn to customize this list of websites in “Creating a List of Top Sites” 
on page 338).
3.	
Click the History tab. Safari displays thumbnail images of your previously 
visited websites, as shown in Figure 40-2.
4.	
Press the left or right arrow keys to flip through the Cover Flow display of 
previously viewed websites. If you have a trackpad, you can flip through 
these thumbnail images by swiping two fingers horizontally across the 
trackpad.
5.	
Click the thumbnail image of the website you want to view again. Your cho-
sen website appears.

Viewing a List and Thumbnail Images of Previously Visited 
Websites
If you like the idea of browsing through both a list and thumbnail images of previ-
ously viewed websites, you can do this:
1.	
Open the Safari web browser. 
2.	
Select HistoryShow All History. Safari displays thumbnail images of 
your previously visited websites along with a list of the website names and 
addresses, as shown in Figure 40-3.
3.	
Press the left/right or up/down arrow keys to flip through your list of previ-
ously viewed websites. If you have a trackpad, you can flip through these 
thumbnail images by swiping two fingers horizontally across the trackpad.
4.	
Click the thumbnail image of the website you want to view again (or double-
click on the website name). Your chosen website appears.
Creating a List of Top Sites
Chances are good that you’ll want to visit the same handful of websites every day, 
such as your favorite news sites. You could rely on the History list, but you might 
prefer the Safari feature called Top Sites.
The idea behind Top Sites is to let Safari automatically track which websites 
you visit most often and save those websites as thumbnail images that you can 
view and click to visit those sites again. 
Figure 40-3: Viewing a list and thumbnail images of previously viewed 
websites

Viewing the Top Sites List
The Top Sites list displays the websites you’ve visited most often. To view the Top 
Sites list, do this:
1.	
Open the Safari web browser. 
2.	
Click the Top Sites icon in the upper-left corner of the Safari window, or 
select HistoryShow Top Sites. Your frequently visited websites appear as 
a list of thumbnail images, as shown in Figure 40-4. A star in the upper-right 
corner of a website thumbnail means that the site has new information since 
the last time you looked at it.
3.	
Click the thumbnail image of the website you want to view. Your chosen 
website appears.
Editing the Top Sites List
Your Top Sites list changes over time as you visit new websites and stop visiting 
other sites. If you want, you can define a website to always appear on the Top Sites 
list. On the other hand, you can also define a website to never appear on the Top 
Sites list. To define a website on your Top Sites list, do this:
1.	
Open the Safari web browser. 
2.	
Click the Top Sites icon in the upper-left corner of the Safari window, or 
select HistoryShow Top Sites (see Figure 40-4).
3.	
Click the Edit button that appears in the bottom-left corner of the Top Sites 
window. An X and a pushpin icon appear in the upper-left corner of each 
thumbnail, as shown in Figure 40-5.

of the Top Sites window to change the number and size of the thumbnail 
images displayed.
8.	
Click the Done button in the lower-left corner of the Top Sites window. 
Searching the Top Sites List
If you want to find a particular website in your Top Sites list, you can search for it 
manually or let Safari search for it (this is much faster). To search through your Top 
Sites list, do this:
1.	
Open the Safari web browser.
2.	
Click the Top Sites icon in the upper-left corner of the Safari window, or 
select HistoryShow Top Sites. Your frequently visited websites appear 
as a list of thumbnail images (see Figure 40-4).

Using Bookmarks
The Top Sites feature can be a handy way to visit the websites you use most fre-
quently (such as news sites). To keep track of favorite sites that you visit less often 
(such as shopping sites), use bookmarks.
A bookmark can save a website’s address in two places (as shown in 
Figure 40-7):

The Bookmarks menu
The Bookmarks Bar displays your favorite websites near the top of the Safari 
window so you can access any website with a click of the mouse. The Bookmarks 
menu tucks your favorite websites out of sight until you click the menu to view them. 
You can store different websites on the Bookmarks Bar and Bookmarks menu.

Bookmarking a Website
Bookmarks are useful for saving websites that you plan to revisit or don’t want to 
forget. To save a bookmark in either the Bookmarks Bar or Bookmarks menu, do 
the following:
1.	
Open the Safari web browser.
2.	
Go to a website that you know 
you’ll want to visit again, such 
as http://www.nostarch.com/ or 
http://www.yahoo.com/.
3.	
Click the plus icon that appears 
to the far left of the Address 
bar (you can also press z-D 
or select BookmarksAdd

as shown in Figure 40-8.
4.	
Type a descriptive name for your 
bookmark (or edit the existing 
name displayed in the text box).
5.	
Click the pop-up menu and choose a location in which to store your book-
mark, such as Bookmarks Bar or Bookmarks Menu. (You can also store a 
website in the Reading List or the Top Sites list at this time.)
6.	
Click Add. Safari adds your bookmark to your chosen location.
For a quick way to store bookmarks in the Bookmarks Bar, you can drag a 
website address over the Bookmarks Bar as follows:
1.	
Open the Safari web browser.
2.	
Visit a website that you know you’ll want to visit again, such as http://www 
.cnn.com/ or http://www.yahoo.com/.

Editing a Bookmark
After you create a bookmark, you might later want to change its name or edit its 
stored website address. Here’s how to edit a bookmark name or address:
1.	
Open the Safari web browser.
2.	
Click the Open Bookmarks icon on the far left of the Bookmarks Bar, or 
select BookmarksShow All Bookmarks. The Bookmarks window appears.
3.	
Click Bookmarks Bar or Bookmarks Menu under the Collections category 
in the left pane of the Bookmarks window. The right pane displays all the 
bookmarks stored in the selection (see Figure 40-9).
4.	
Right-click a bookmark and select Edit Name or Edit Address. Your chosen 
bookmark’s name or address appears highlighted.
5.	
Use the arrow and delete keys to edit the existing name, or type a new name 
or address for your bookmark and press return. 
Deleting a Bookmark
You can delete a bookmark you no longer want. Here’s how:
1.	
Open the Safari web browser.
2.	
Click the Open Bookmarks icon on the far left of the Bookmarks Bar, or 
select BookmarksShow All Bookmarks. The Bookmarks window appears.

in the left pane of the Bookmarks window. The right pane displays all the 
bookmarks stored in the selection (see Figure 40-9).
4.	
Right-click a bookmark and select Delete. Alternatively, you can drag the 
bookmark over the Trash icon on the Dock.
Q
Q Note: If you delete a bookmark by mistake, press -Z to retrieve it.
Organizing Bookmarks in Folders
The more bookmarks you add to the Bookmarks Bar or Bookmarks menu, the 
more crowded your bookmarks lists can get, and the harder it can be to find the 
one bookmark you want. To avoid this problem, you can store related bookmarks 
in a folder.
Creating a Bookmark Folder
The Bookmarks Bar can display bookmarks and folders. When you click a book-
mark, Safari displays the appropriate website. When you click a folder, a menu 
of bookmarks appears, as shown in Figure 40-10. You can identify folders easily 
because they display a downward-pointing arrow to the right of the folder name.

	
Remembering Your Favorite Websites	
|	 345
On the Bookmarks menu, bookmark names appear with icons, while each 
folder name appears with a folder icon and an arrow pointing to the right. Moving 
the pointer over a folder on the Bookmarks menu displays a submenu that lists the 
bookmarks stored in the folder, as shown in Figure 40-11.
Here’s how to create a bookmark folder:
1.	
Open the Safari web browser.
2.	
Click the Open Bookmarks icon on the far left of the Bookmarks Bar, 
or select BookmarksAdd Bookmark Folder. The Bookmarks window

Type a descriptive name for your bookmark folder and press return. At this 
point, your newly created and named bookmark folder is empty and ready to 
store bookmarks.
Adding Bookmarks to a Folder
After you’ve created a folder, you need to store bookmarks in it. Here’s how to 
copy bookmarks into a folder:
1.	
Open the Safari web browser.
2.	
Click the Open Bookmarks icon on the far left of the Bookmarks Bar, or 
select BookmarksShow All Bookmarks. The Bookmarks window appears. 
3.	
Click Bookmarks Bar or Bookmarks Menu under the Collections category 
in the left pane of the Bookmarks window to view all the bookmarks stored in 
that location (see Figure 40-9).
4.	
Drag and drop a bookmark from the right pane over the bookmark folder in 
the left pane. (Dragging a bookmark moves it from its current location into 
your bookmark folder. If you want to copy a bookmark, hold down the option 
key as you drag and drop the bookmark.)
5.	
Repeat step 3 for each bookmark you want to store in your bookmark folder.

Moving a Bookmark Folder
After you’ve filled a bookmark folder with bookmarks, you need to move the folder 
off the left pane and onto the Bookmarks Bar or Bookmarks menu. Here’s how:
1.	
Open the Safari web browser.
2.	
Click the Open Bookmarks icon on the far left of the Bookmarks Bar, or 
select BookmarksShow All Bookmarks. The Bookmarks window appears. 
3.	
Click Bookmarks Bar or Bookmarks Menu under the Collections category 
in the left pane of the Bookmarks window. You’ll see all your bookmarks in 
the right pane (see Figure 40-9).
4.	
Drag your bookmark folder from the left pane to a spot in the right pane. A 
horizontal line appears where your bookmark folder will appear if you release 
the left mouse button.
Q
Q Note: The contents of existing folders appear indented so you can see which 
bookmarks appear directly on the Bookmarks Bar or Bookmarks menu and 
which ones appear inside a folder. It’s even possible to drag and drop a 
folder inside another folder. 
5.	
Drop your bookmark (release the left mouse button) when the horizontal line 
appears at the place where you want to store your bookmark folder.
Rearranging Bookmarks and Folders
You can move bookmarks and folders on both the Bookmarks Bar and Bookmarks 
menu, like so:
1.	
Open the Safari Web browser
2.	
Click the Open Bookmarks icon on the far left of the Bookmarks Bar, or 
select BookmarksShow All Bookmarks. The Bookmarks window appears. 
3.	
Click Bookmarks Bar or Bookmarks Menu under the Collections category 
in the left pane of the Bookmarks window. The right pane displays all the 
bookmarks stored in that location (see Figure 40-9).
4.	
Drag a bookmark or folder in the right pane up or down. A horizontal line 
appears where your bookmark or folder will appear when you release the left 
mouse button.
5.	
Drop your bookmark or folder (release the left mouse button) when the hori-
zontal line appears in the place where you want the bookmark or folder to 
appear.
Saving and Sharing Bookmarks
As your collection of bookmarks grows, you might want to make a backup copy 
and store this copy in a safe place; this protects your bookmarks from corruption 
or loss. Another reason for saving your bookmarks is to share them with others so 
they can visit your favorite websites.

348	 |	
Chapter 40
Here’s how to save your bookmarks:
1.	
Open the Safari web browser.
2.	
Select FileExport Bookmarks. An Export Bookmarks dialog appears.
3.	
Click in the Save As text box and type a descriptive name for your 
bookmark file.
4.	
Click the Where pop-up menu and choose a folder in which to store your 
bookmarks.
5.	
Click Save.
Q
Q Note: If somebody gives you a saved list of bookmarks, you can add the 
bookmarks to your own collection by selecting FileImport Bookmarks and 
loading the new bookmark file. After you import bookmarks, you’ll probably 
want to rearrange the newly imported bookmarks to organize them to fit 
within your own bookmarks.
Additional Ideas for Using Bookmarks and 
the History Menu
By peeking at someone else’s History menu, you can see the websites they’ve 
visited recently; this is a simple way to check up on the websites your children (or 
spouse) have viewed. But if you’re worried about other people accessing your 
browsing history, flip ahead to Chapter 42.
If there are certain websites that you tend to visit regularly, store them in 
the Top Sites list or as a bookmark. Bookmarks can help you organize your web 
browsing habits and keep your favorite websites handy. Bookmark your favorite 
shopping websites in one folder and recipe websites in another. Then export your 
bookmarks and share them with friends so they can visit your favorite websites with 
a single click. With bookmarks (and the History menu), you should never lose track 
of another website again (unless, of course, you lose track of your computer).

41
Rather than save a website’s address, you might 
be more interested in saving the contents of a 
particular web page. For example, you might 
have a favorite news site that you’ve book-
marked, but if you run across a particularly 
interesting story, you may want to save it for 
future reading. 
If you just bookmark that website, its 
­con­tents might change before you can read 
the article you’re interested in. If you lose your 
Internet connection, you won’t be able to read 
it at all. To avoid both problems, you can add 
the web page to your reading list, print it out, 
or save the page as a file to view and print out 
at your leisure. 
Saving a

You can also send the information on a web page to someone else. Rather 
than printing the page and mailing it or saving the page as a file and sending it as 
an attachment to an email message, your Macintosh lets you email web pages in 
one easy step. 
Project goal: Make Internet research easier by saving information on web 
pages as separate files that you can read later at your convenience, even without 
an Internet connection.
What You’ll Be Using
To save web page information and email it to someone, you’ll use the following:
>
>
An Internet connection
>
>
The Safari web browser
>
>
The Mail program
Using a Reading List
While you’re browsing through different websites, you might find a website that you 
want to read, but you don’t have time to do so right away. To save this website, you 
can store it as part of your Safari reading list. A reading list saves websites that you 
marked to read later.
Creating a Reading List
Normally, Safari hides your reading list from view. However, you can make it appear 
or disappear by clicking the Reading List icon in the upper-left corner of the Safari 
window. To create and view a reading list, do this:
1.	
Open the Safari web browser. 
2.	
Click the Reading List icon in the upper-left corner of the Safari window, or 
select ViewShow Reading List. The Reading List pane appears on the left 
side of the Safari window, as shown in Figure 41-1.
3.	
Open a website that you want to save in your reading list. (You can type the 
website’s address in the Address bar or find it through a search engine.)
4.	
Click the Add Page button in the upper-right corner of the Reading List 
pane. Safari stores your chosen website in the reading list. The Reading List 
pane displays your most recently saved website at the top and your oldest 
saved website at the bottom.

Saving to Page Source (HTML) or Web Archive Format
Saving a web page as a Page Source file can be useful if you want to view a page’s 
HTML tags to see how the web page is constructed, or if you want to share web 
pages with people who don’t use a Macintosh. The drawback to the Page Source 
format is that it doesn’t always save all parts or formatting of a web page; it some-
times omits certain graphics or skews the formatting so that text appears scat-
tered instead of neatly aligned.
The Web Archive format creates a file larger than an equivalent Page Source 
file, but it retains a web page’s formatting more accurately than Page Source. The 
drawback to the Web Archive format is that it displays correctly only when the 
Safari web browser is used to access it. If you plan to share web pages with some-
one who also uses Safari, the Web Archive format will display the web page more 
accurately than Page Source.
Here’s how to save a web page in the Page Source or Web Archive formats:
1.	
Open the Safari web browser.
2.	
Go to a web page that you want to save and select FileSave As. A Save As 
dialog appears.
3.	
(Optional) Click in the Export As text box and type a name for your saved 
web page.
4.	
Click the Format pop-up menu and choose Page Source or Web Archive, 
as shown in Figure 41-3.
5.	
Click Save.
Figure 41-3: The Save As dialog lets you save a web page in 
the Page Source or Web Archive formats.

Saving a Web Page as a PDF File
When you save web pages as PDF files, you can share them with just about any-
one. The PDF format preserves the exact appearance of a web page. Here’s how 
to save a web page as a PDF file:
1.	
Open the Safari web browser.
2.	
Go to a web page that you want to save, and select FilePrint. A Print dia-
log appears.
3.	
Click the PDF button in the bottom-left corner of the Print dialog, as shown 
in Figure 41-4. A menu appears.
4.	
Select Save as PDF. A Save dialog appears, as shown in Figure 41-5.
5.	
(Optional) Click in the Save As text box and type a name for your web page.
6.	
(Optional) Click in the Title, Author, Subject, and Keywords text boxes and 
type any information you want to save in those text boxes.
7.	
Click Save.
Q
Q Note: Did you notice the Security Options button in the Save dialog (see Fig-
ure 41-5)? If you click this button, a Security Options dialog appears. Enter a 
password here to protect your PDF file so that it can be opened only with 
a password. This feature can be handy to protect sensitive documents from 
prying eyes.

Emailing a Web Page
After you save a web page as a file, you can send that file as an attachment to an 
email message. You can also email a web page via the Mail program directly from 
Safari, without saving it first. When you email a web page, you can send it as a link 
or embed it into your email message.
Q
Q Note: If you haven’t set up Mail yet or don’t use Mail to manage your email, 
this will not work. For instructions on configuring Mail, see Chapter 44.
The disadvantage of sending a page as a link is that websites often change, 
which could break the link (that is, the address of the page you are trying to send 
may change). If someone tries to view a broken link, he or she will see an error mes-
sage instead of the intended web page.
The disadvantage of sending an entire web page embedded as part of your 
message is that it increases the size of your message. In addition, some people fil-
ter their email to block messages that contain graphics (to avoid junk email), which 
means your message may not get through the filter.
Emailing an Entire Web Page
Here’s how to email a web page:
1.	
Open the Safari web browser.
2.	
Go to a web page that you want to send.
Figure 41-5: The Save dialog displays text boxes for 
identifying your PDF file.

3.	
Select FileMail Contents of This Page. The Mail window appears and 
displays the web page as part of your message.
4.	
Click in the To text box and type an email address.
5.	
Click Send.
Emailing a Link to a Web Page
Some people may not be able to view a web page that you send them, so you can 
just send a link to the website instead. Here’s how to email a link to a web page:
1.	
Open the Safari web browser.
2.	
Go to a web page that you want to share.
3.	
Select FileMail Link to This Page. The Mail window appears and displays 
the link to the web page.
4.	
Click in the To text box and type an email address.
5.	
Click Send.
Additional Ideas for Saving Web Pages
With so many ways to save information off the Internet, you’ll always be able to 
organize information to access it again and again. One unique way to use the infor-
mation you find is to have your Macintosh read text to you.
Just save a web page to a PDF file and open that PDF file using the Preview 
program. Highlight any text that you want to hear, right-click over your selected 
text, and select Add to iTunes as Spoken Track. Now you’ll be able to read along 
while hearing your Mac read the text back to you. This can be especially fun to do 
with young children to help them learn to read, or it can be helpful as a way to read 
text and then refresh your memory later by listening to the text read aloud.
In case you just want to save a web page temporarily, store it as part of your 
Reading List. Then you can find the web pages you want to read later and remove 
them from your Reading List when you’re done. By saving your web research as part 
of your Reading List or in your favorite file format, you’ll never lose a valuable tid-
bit of Internet information again. With a Macintosh, you’ll not only have fun doing 
research on the Internet, but you’ll always have the information you’ve dug up at 
your fingertips when you need it. 

42
Every time you use the Internet, you risk los-
ing your privacy. If you visit malicious websites, 
you risk losing your credit card number or other 
sensitive information to thieves. In addition, if 
others use your Macintosh, they can see which 
websites you’ve visited. To protect your privacy 
on the Internet, you need to keep your informa-
tion and your activities away from the prying 
eyes of others. 
Project goals: Identify when it’s safe to 
send credit card numbers and other sensitive 
information over the Internet. Wipe out all data 
that could show others which websites you’ve 
visited.

What You’ll Be Using
To protect your Internet privacy you’ll use the following:
>
>
An Internet connection
>
>
The Safari web browser
Identifying Safe Websites
When buying products or services over the Internet, you usually need to enter 
your credit card number. Unfortunately, typing anything on an Internet web page 
is never completely secure due to the way the Internet works.
When you connect to a website, your computer actually connects to half 
a dozen other computers that pass the data gathered from your input from one 
computer to another until the data reaches its destination. This means that any-
thing you type can be seen and intercepted by multiple computers between you 
and the final destination computer that hosts the website. Think of reciting your 
credit card numbers to six total strangers, who then relay those numbers to a store. 
How safe do you think your credit card numbers might be?
When using the Internet, you should assume that anything you type can be 
intercepted and read by strangers unless the site that you’re visiting is a secure site 
that uses encryption. 
Encryption scrambles any data you type or send so that only the final receiv-
ing computer (such as a shopping website) can decipher that information. Anyone 
else reading encrypted data along the way will see random gibberish.
To determine whether a website uses encryption, you can do the following:
1.	
Click the Safari icon on the Dock. (If the Safari icon does not appear on the 
Dock, double-click the Safari icon inside the Applications folder.) The Safari 
window appears.
2.	
Visit an online shopping site, such as Amazon.com. Pick an item to buy and 
place your order. As soon as the website asks you to enter sensitive informa-
tion such as your home address or a credit card number, look for the lock 
icon, as shown in Figure 42-1.
3.	
Look at the Address bar in Safari that shows the site’s complete web 
address. If the site is secure, the Address bar should contain the URL (the 
uniform resource locator, or address) of the website itself, beginning with 
Figure 42-1: Before typing credit card numbers or other sensitive 
information, look for the lock icon to determine whether it is secure.
Lock icon

	
Keeping Your Internet Activities Private

the characters https, which stand for HyperText Transfer Protocol over 
SSL (Secure Socket Layer—the part that makes the site secure). If the URL 
includes random letters and numbers, you may be visiting a fraudulent 
­website masquerading as a legitimate site. If you don’t see the https, 
the website is probably not secure and you should not enter credit card 
n­umbers or other personal information.
Q
Q Note: The larger online stores process their own credit card transactions, 
which means you should see the name of the company as part of the website 
address. Smaller online stores often pay another company to process their 
credit card transactions. In this case, you’ll see the name of a credit card pro-
cessing company (such as PayPal; www.paypal.com) in the URL rather than the 
name of the small online store. 
4.	
Only type in sensitive information, like your credit card number, if you see 
the following:
>
>
A recognizable name in the website URL
>
>
The letters https:// at the front of the URL
>
>
The lock (encryption) icon in the upper-right corner of the Safari 
window
Q
Q Note: If any one of these three items is missing, you may still be connected to 
a secure site, but beware. You might play it safe and shop elsewhere, research 
the reputation of the online store in question, or place your order by tele-
phone instead.
Clearing Your Internet Tracks
Every time you browse the Internet, the Safari browser stores three types of infor-
mation. First, Safari tracks all websites you’ve visited so you can return to any previ-
ously viewed sites. Just click the History menu in the Safari menu bar to see a list of 
recently visited websites.
Second, Safari stores every visited web page in a storage area called a cache. 
The cache speeds up your web browsing by retrieving web pages from its local 
storage, which is faster than downloading web pages off the Internet. 
Finally, Safari stores any text you type into the Google search text box. For 
example, if you search Google for information about chocolate, you might want 
to find all websites offering this information again a day or two later. Rather than 
retype the phrase chocolate every time you want to search, you can view a list of 
your past Google searches and click the chocolate search to repeat it, as shown in 
Figure 42-2.
Storing your browsing history, cached web pages, and Google searches 
can make browsing faster and easier. Unfortunately, anyone with access to your 
Macintosh can view Safari’s history or cache to see which web pages you’ve visited 
and skim through Safari’s list of Google searches to see what you tried to find. If 

360	 |	
Chapter 42
this information might prove 
embarrassing or just plain 
annoying, flush this informa-
tion out of your Macintosh.
Emptying the Cache
To clean out Safari’s cache, 
do this:
1.	
Start Safari. The Safari 
window appears.
2.	
Select SafariEmpty 
Cache. A dialog 
appears, asking if you 
really want to empty the 
cache.
3.	
Click Empty (or Cancel). 
Clearing Your Google Searches 
If you don’t like the idea of someone peeking at what you’ve been searching for, 
clear out your Google searches by doing this:
1.	
Start Safari. The Safari window appears.
2.	
Click the magnifying glass icon that appears on the left end of the Google 
search text box. A pop-up menu appears  
(see Figure 42-2).
3.	
Click Clear Recent Searches. 
Resetting Safari
To clear the rest of the 
data in Safari that could 
reveal your behavior on 
the Internet, you’ll need 
to do the following:
1.	
Start Safari. The 
Safari window 
appears. 
2.	
Select Safari 
Reset Safari. A 
Reset Safari dialog 
appears, as shown 
in Figure 42-3.
3.	
Make sure you 
select all the dif-
ferent checkboxes 
Figure 42-3: The Reset Safari window lets you 
reset Safari back to its original, unused state.

that represent the data you want to reset, such as Clear history, Remove 
saved names and passwords, or Remove all website data. (You can clear 
or leave selected the other checkboxes.) 
4.	
Click Reset (or Cancel).
Avoiding Fraudulent Websites and 
Phishing Scams
Online con artists often design fake websites that look exactly like well-known 
sites such as sites for Apple or eBay. To avoid visiting such fraudulent websites, 
never visit any website address links sent to you by email unless you trust the per-
son sending you the link. (Of course, sometimes even trusted friends can be fooled 
into sending you a link to a fraudulent website, or their email accounts can be 
hacked and used by someone else, so be very careful.)
Instead of clicking a link sent to you in email, type the website address into 
the Address bar yourself or search for the site first through Google. Typing a 
website address yourself ensures that you’re visiting the legitimate website and 
not  fraudulent one whose address may be spelled nearly the same (such as www 
.amozon.com instead of www.amazon.com). When you search for websites through 
Google, Google can often identify and alert you to suspicious website addresses.
Hiding Your Browsing from Others
To guard your privacy from others, lock your Macintosh away. If that’s not possible, 
create separate accounts (see Chapter 19) to isolate your information from other 
users. Next, clear Safari’s history and cache (see “Clearing Your Internet Tracks” 
on page 359). Once you’ve done all that, turn on Private Browsing to keep Safari 
from saving your browsing history.
Here’s how to turn on Private 
Browsing:
1.	
Start Safari. The Safari window 
appears.
2.	
Select SafariPrivate Browsing. 
A dialog appears, asking if you 
want to turn on Private Browsing.
3.	
Click OK (or Cancel). When Pri-
vate Browsing is turned on, a 
checkmark appears next to Private 
Browsing in the Safari menu, as 
shown in Figure 42-4. You’ll also 
see the word PRIVATE on the 
right side of the Address bar.
Figure 42-4: You can verify when 
Private Browsing is turned on.

Chapter 42
Remember that privacy may not seem important until you lose it. By taking 
steps to protect yourself now, you’ll stay on the safe side.
Cleaning Out Cookies
Many websites store small text files, called cookies, on your computer to track the 
web pages you’ve visited. Many e-commerce sites such as Amazon.com use cook-
ies to determine which products you’ve viewed so they can use that information to 
display similar products that you might be interested in buying.
In Safari, you have the option of blocking cookies completely or just from 
third parties and advertisers who track your activities across a website. Safari also 
gives you the option of preventing websites from using location services, which 
can identify your physical location. 
To block cookies and turn off location services, do this:
1.	
Start Safari. The Safari window appears.
2.	
Select SafariPreferences. The Preferences window appears.
3.	
Click the Privacy icon. The Privacy window appears, as shown in Figure 42-5.
4.	
(Optional) Click the Remove All Website Data button. (If you click the 
Details button, you can view all the websites that have placed cookies on 
your computer, as shown in Figure 42-6. Then you can click a website and 
click the Remove button to remove cookies from that website, or click the 
Remove All button to remove all cookies stored on your computer. When 
you’re finished, click the Done button.)
5.	
Select a radio button in the Block cookies category. 
6.	
Select a radio button in the Limit website access to location services 
category.
7.	
Click the close button of the Privacy window.
Figure 42-5: The Privacy window lets you block cookies and location 
services.

Additional Ideas for Browsing in Private
Many people use Safari because that’s the browser that comes with every Macin-
tosh. However, consider using other browsers such as Chrome (http://www.google 
.com/chrome/), Opera (http://www.opera.com/), or Firefox (http://www.mozilla 
.com/). If you use a different browser, anyone trying to track your Internet activities 
will have to know that you don’t rely on Safari.
If you need more security and privacy than Safari or a regular browser offers, 
consider using a proxy service, a virtual private network (VPN), or an anonymizing 
service like Tor (http://www.tor.com/) to truly hide your tracks. 
Figure 42-6: The Details button opens a dialog that shows you 
which websites have placed cookies on your computer.

You can start using Safari right away, but if you 
don’t like the way Safari behaves or looks, you 
can often change its behavior and appearance. 
Such changes can make Safari look prettier or 
make it easier to use. Whatever your reasons, 
you don’t have to settle for Safari’s default 
behavior when you can customize Safari to 
make it work exactly the way you like.

Customizing Safari’s Search Engine, 
Home Page, and Downloads
You can start using Safari right away without changing a thing. However, three set-
tings you might want to modify are Safari’s default search engine, home page, and 
downloads folder. There are three search engines you can choose: Google, Bing, 
and Yahoo!. Search engines tend to retrieve different information, which is why 
some people prefer one search engine over another one.
The home page is the first web page that appears when you load Safari. 
Safari typically displays Apple’s own website as the default home page, but you 
might want to choose something different, such as your favorite news site. 
When you download a file from the Internet, Safari stores that file in its 
default Downloads folder. This is probably where you want to store your down-
loaded files, but if you have a reason to define a different folder for storing down-
loads, you can.
Choosing a Different Search Engine
Whenever you type a word or phrase in the Search field in the upper-right corner 
of the Safari window, Safari uses a search engine to display your results. By default, 
this search engine is Google, but to choose a different search engine, do this:
1.	
Start Safari. The Safari window appears.
2.	
Select SafariPreferences. A Preferences window appears.
3.	
Click the General icon. The General window appears, as shown in Figure 43-1.
4.	
Click the Default search engine pop-up menu and choose Google, Bing, or 
Yahoo!.
5.	
Click the close button of the General window.
Choosing a Different Home Page
Your home page is the page Safari opens when it starts for the first time. To define 
a new home page, do this:
1.	
Start Safari. The Safari window appears.
2.	
(Optional) Navigate to a new website that you want to make your home page 
from now on.
3.	
Select SafariPreferences. A Preferences window appears.
4.	
Click the General icon. The General window appears (see Figure 43-1).

5.	
Click in the Homepage text field and type a website address, or click the 
Set to Current Page button to use the currently displayed website as your 
home page.
6.	
Click the close button of the General window.
Changing the Download Settings
There are three options you can modify when downloading files. First, you can 
choose a different folder to store your downloads. Unless you have a good reason 
to choose a different folder, it makes sense to let Safari store files in the Down-
loads folder.
Second, you can define how Safari cleans out its list of downloaded items. 
The default is Manually, which means you must remove the downloaded items 
from the downloads list yourself, but you can also choose to have Safari remove a 
downloaded item when you exit Safari or when the file successfully downloads.
Perhaps the most serious security setting in Safari is its default behavior to 
automatically open supposedly “safe” files after downloading. Although Safari 
considers certain files “safe,” such as movies or PDF files, it’s best to turn this 
option off to provide greater security against viruses and Trojan horses.
To change Safari’s download settings, do this:
1.	
Start Safari. The Safari window appears.
2.	
Select SafariPreferences. A Preferences window appears.
Figure 43-1: The General window lets you customize common default 
settings.

an option such as Manually or When Safari Quits.
6.	
(Optional) Select or clear the Open “safe” files after downloading 
checkbox.
7.	
Click the close button of the General window.
Customizing the Appearance of a Web Page
The appearance of a web page is defined by each particular website, but if you find 
the text too hard to read, you have two options. First, you can enlarge (or shrink) the 
text on a website. Second, you can strip away most of the ads in an article and just 
browse through the main text.
Zooming In and Out
Unlike a book or newspaper, the text and graphics on a website aren’t fixed in size. 
If you find text too small (or too large), Safari lets you modify the size as follows:
>
>
Zoom in (make text larger)  Select ViewZoom In or press -+
>
>
Zoom out (make text smaller)  Select ViewZoom Out or press -–
Q
Q Note: If you have a trackpad, you can also zoom in by pinching two fingers 
outwards on the trackpad or zoom out by pinching two fingers inwards on 
the trackpad. To zoom into a column of text perfectly, try double-tapping 
with two fingers. Double-tap again to zoom back out. 
Using Reader to Remove Ads 
One of the biggest problems with many websites is that each web page gets clut-
tered with so many ads on the sides. If you find this distracting, Safari can strip 
away most graphics and just display the main text on a web page with a feature 
called the Reader. 
To strip away ads and view just a web page article, do this:
1.	
Start Safari. The Safari window appears.
2.	
Open a web page that contains a main article of text that you want to read, 
such as a news story in Yahoo!, as shown in Figure 43-2.
3.	
Select ViewShow Reader. Safari displays a window that contains the text 
of the currently displayed website, as shown in Figure 43-3.
4.	
Move the mouse pointer near the bottom of the Reader window to display 
controls to zoom in, zoom out, send the story as an email attachment, print 
the story, or close the Reader window.
5.	
Press the esc key or click the close button on the controls near the bottom 
of the Reader window.

Using Windows and Tabs
Each time you open another website, Safari replaces the currently displayed web 
page with a new one. However, sometimes you may want to keep two or more 
websites visible at the same time. To do this, Safari offers two solutions:
>
>
Windows
>
>
Tabs
Displaying multiple websites in separate windows lets you place two web-
sites side-by-side or arrange them on the screen. Displaying multiple websites in 
separate tabs lets you quickly switch between two or more websites, as shown in 
Figure 43-4.
Opening a New Window or Tab
To open a new tab or window, choose one of the following:
>
>
Open a new window  Select FileNew Window or press -N
>
>
Open a new tab  Select FileNew Tab or press -T
Q
Q Note: When you have two or more tabs displayed, a plus button appears to 
the far right of the tabs. By clicking this plus button, you can open a new tab.

Converting Tabs to Windows (and Vice Versa)
When you open tabs or windows, you can always convert a tab to a window or 
merge a window back into a tab. To change a tab into a separate window, choose 
one of the following:
>
>
Drag the tab off the tab bar and drop it. 
>
>
Select WindowMove Tab to New Window. 
To change a window into a tab, do this:
>
>
Select WindowMerge All Windows. 
Additional Ideas for Customizing Safari
Zooming in and out or using the Reader window can help you view web pages in 
different ways when you need to change the appearance of a web page. Choosing 
to display websites in tabs or separate windows can also let you change the way 
you browse. For more permanent changes to Safari, define your own home page, 
search engine, or downloads folder.
For more ways to customize Safari, consider adding an extension or plug-in 
from the Safari Extensions page (https://extensions.apple.com/). Extensions are 
programs that work with Safari to provide new features, such as letting you read 
Twitter feeds or find the latest sports scores more easily. 
Whether you want to use the default settings of Safari or modify your own 
settings, Safari can be your link to the Internet, so take some time to make sure 
Safari works exactly the way you like.

One of the most popular uses for the Internet 
is email. You can send and receive messages 
from people all over the world, absolutely free. 
When you pay for Internet access through an 
Internet service provider (ISP), you’ll get an email 
account, which lets you send and receive email.
Many email accounts let you read and write 
messages through any web browser, such as 
Safari. However, you can also use an email 
program to retrieve, read, and compose your 
email messages. To help you use email, every 
Macintosh comes with a free email program 
called Mail.
Project goal: Set up the Mail program to 
work with your email account.

>
Email information from the company running your email account (such as 
an ISP) or login information for a free mail service like Gmail or Yahoo! Mail.
Getting Your Email Account Information
When you sign up for Internet access through an ISP, you may receive a list of infor-
mation needed to create and set up an email account on your computer. If not, get 
a piece of paper, contact the company responsible for running your email account 
(such as your ISP), and write down the following information:
>
>
Your email address  You can choose the first part of your email address, 
but the last part usually contains the name of the company running your 
email account, such as Bill@aol.com or JuneAllison@earthlink.net. When you 
sign up with an ISP, you may need to specify a username, which your ISP will 
use to create your email account. You may have the option of creating addi-
tional email accounts as well.
>
>
Your password  You can choose your own password, but your email pro-
vider may have created an initial password for your account to help you get 
started.
Q
Q Note:  You only need to know the server name if Mail can’t automatically set 
up your email account.
>
>
The name of the server that retrieves your email (often called a POP, 
IMAP, or Exchange server)  You must get this information from the com-

Configuring Mail Automatically
After you have your email account information, you need to configure Mail to 
work with your email account. The first time you start the Mail program, it guides 
you through the process of typing in your email account information. If you have 
already set up an email account in Mail and want to configure a second account, 
Mail guides you through the same steps as if you were starting the Mail program 
for the first time.
Here’s how to configure Mail to work with an email account:
1.	
Click the Mail icon on the Dock, or double-click the Mail icon in the Applica-
tions folder to start Mail.
2.	
Select FileAdd Account. (If you’re starting Mail for the very first time, 
you won’t have to select FileAdd Account.) A Welcome to Mail dialog 
appears, asking for your full name, email address, and password, as shown 
in Figure 44-1.
3.	
Click in the Full Name text box and type your name. The name (or nickname) 
you type here will appear in the From field when people receive your email 
messages.
4.	
Click in the Email Address text box and type your full email address, such as 
JSmith@apple.com. This email address is usually the account name provided 
by your ISP or the company that runs your email account.
Figure 44-1: A dialog appears, asking for your initial email 
account information.

5.	
Click in the Password text box and type your password. To prevent people 
from seeing your password, the Password text box masks the actual charac-
ters with dots. After you type your full name, email address, and password, 
an Automatically set up account checkbox appears already selected.
6.	
Click Continue. Mail will try to finish configuring your email account auto-
matically. If this step fails, you’ll need to follow the steps in the next section.
Configuring Mail Manually
If Mail cannot automatically configure itself to work with your email account, you 
may need to configure the server information manually with the following steps:
1.	
Follow the steps in the preceding section until you reach the point at which 
Mail cannot automatically configure itself to work with your email account.
2.	
Click Continue. A dialog appears, asking for your incoming mail server, as 
shown in Figure 44-2.
3.	
Click the Account Type pop-up menu and choose POP, IMAP, Exchange or 
Exchange IMAP. In general, a POP account is used for individual accounts, 
while IMAP and Exchange accounts are more often used by corporations to 
set up email accounts for employees.
4.	
Click in the Description text box and type any text that identifies your email 
account, such as Personal Mail. Whatever you type here is for your benefit 
only, so you can make up any descriptive name.
Figure 44-2: The Incoming Mail Server dialog lets you define 
the name of the server that delivers your email.

Additional Ideas for Creating Accounts 
in Mail
Many people may need only a single email account, but Mail lets you retrieve email 
from multiple accounts if you want. For example, you might have a work email 
address and a personal email address. By configuring both accounts to work with 
Mail, you can read all your email from within a single program.
If you use another email program, you can transfer your saved messages into 
Mail by selecting FileImport Mailboxes. Doing this makes it easy to switch from 
another email program to Mail.
Although configuring accounts can be a nuisance, take heart. You’ll have to 
do this only on rare occasions, such as the first time you use Mail. After that, you 
can forget all about the technical details in configuring the email account and just 
enjoy reading and writing messages using Mail.
Don’t forget: You can also use Apple’s Mail interface to read webmail 
services like Gmail or Hotmail. Downloading your account’s messages to your 
computer from the Web is also a quick and easy way to make a backup of your 
correspondence.
Figure 44-4: The Outgoing Mail Server dialog lets you define 
the name of the server that will send your messages out 
over the Internet.

After you’ve set up the Mail program to work 
with your email account (see Chapter 44), you 
can start retrieving and sending messages. To 
read email messages, you can download and 
store them in the Mail program. To write a mes-
sage, you can reply to a previous message or 
create a new message from scratch.

What You’ll Be Using
To read and write email messages, you’ll use the following:
>
>
The Mail program configured to work with your email account
>
>
An Internet connection
>
>
The Address Book
Retrieving Email Messages
To read your messages, you have to retrieve them from the computer (called the 
incoming mail server) that runs your email account. You can retrieve messages 
manually or automatically.
Manually retrieving messages tells Mail, “Check for new messages right 
now.” Automatically retrieving messages tells Mail, “Every few minutes, check for 
new messages and let me know how many new messages you find.”
Manually Retrieving Messages
Generally, you’ll want Mail to check for new messages periodically, such as every 
15 minutes. However, if you’re expecting a message and don’t feel like waiting for 
Mail to retrieve it automatically, you can check for new messages immediately.
To retrieve messages manually, you have several choices:
>
>
Click the Get New Messages button.
>
>
Select MailboxGet All New Mail.
>
>
Select MailboxGet New Mail and then click the name of the email 
account you want to use.
If you’ve configured Mail to work with two or more email accounts, you can 
use the first two methods to retrieve messages for all your email accounts. If you 
choose the third method, you can selectively retrieve messages for a single email 
account.
Automatically Retrieving Messages
To make Mail retrieve messages automatically, you need to define how often Mail 
should check for new messages, such as every 5 minutes. To tell Mail how often to 
check for new messages, do the following:
1.	
Start Mail. (Click the Mail icon on the Dock or double-click the Mail icon in 
the Applications folder.) The Mail window appears.
2.	
Select MailPreferences. A Preferences window appears.
3.	
Click the General icon. The General window appears, as shown in Figure 45-1.

tion. If you click the See More link, you can see the complete message and 
response at the same time, as shown in Figure 45-4.
Retrieving a File Attachment
Many messages contain only text, but some messages can include a file, which is 
called a file attachment. A file attachment can be a word processor document, a 
picture, a movie, a song, or any other type of computer file.
When you receive a file attachment, a paperclip icon appears on the mes-
sage. If you click the Details link, you can also see two buttons labeled Save and 
Quick Look, as shown in Figure 45-5. 
To peek at the contents of the file attachment, click Quick Look. To save the 
file attachment to your Downloads folder, click Save.

Chapter 45
Sending a Message to Multiple People
If you want to send the same message to two or more people, you have several 
choices. First, you can type multiple email addresses in the To text field and sepa-
rate each email address by a comma. 
Second, you can type multiple email addresses in the Cc (carbon copy) 
field and separate each email address with a comma. Third, you can type mul-
tiple email addresses in the Bcc (blind carbon copy) field and separate each email 
address with a comma.
When you type email addresses in the Bcc field, anyone receiving your mes-
sage will not see all the other email addresses you sent the same message to. If you 
choose either of the other two methods, everyone will be able to see all the email 
addresses you sent the same message to, which you may not want others to see.
To display a Cc or Bcc text field when sending a message, create a new mes-
sage or reply to an existing one and then do this:
1.	
Click the Customize icon that appears on the left of the From field. A menu 
appears, as shown in Figure 45-7.

both a Cc and a Bcc text field for a single message.) 
Replying to a Message
When you reply to an existing message, Mail automatically adds the sender’s email 
address and includes the sender’s message to help the recipient better under-
stand your reply. Here’s how to reply to a message:
1.	
Start Mail. The Mail window appears.
2.	
Click a message to which you want to respond.
3.	
Click the Reply icon, or select MessageReply. (If you’re responding to 
a message that several people received, clicking the Reply All icon lets 
you send a message to everyone who received the same message from 
the sender.) A Message window appears that includes the sender’s email 
address and the text that the sender wrote to you.
4.	
Type your own message.
5.	
Click the Send button. 
Forwarding a Message
Rather than reply to an existing message, you might want to pass a message along 
to someone else; this is known as forwarding a message. Here’s how to forward a 
message:
1.	
Start Mail. The Mail window appears.
2.	
Click a message that you want to forward to someone else.
3.	
Click the Forward button. A Message window appears that includes the text 
of the message.

Chapter 45
Q
Q Note: Many email accounts limit the size of file you can attach to a message, 
such as a 10MB maximum. If you try to send a file attachment that’s larger 
than your email account’s maximum limit, you’ll likely see an error message 
that displays the maximum file size allowed. If you need to send an extremely 
large file, consider using a free digital delivery service such as YouSendIt 
(http://www.yousendit.com/), Megaupload (http://www.megaupload.com/), 
or SendThisFile (http://www.sendthisfile.com/).
Additional Ideas for Reading and Writing 
Messages
Using email can be easy and fun. You can make it even easier by making some 
changes to your email messages. For example, if the text of an email message 
appears too small (or too large), you can modify the text size by opening a mes-
sage and selecting FormatStyleBigger (or Smaller), or by pressing -+ (plus 
sign) to make text appear bigger or -– (minus sign) to make text appear smaller.
As an alternative to changing the size of text in a message, you can make 
your Macintosh read your messages to you by selecting EditSpeechStart 
Speaking. This makes your Macintosh read your message to you in a computer-
synthesized voice.
The Mail program makes it easy to read and write messages, so you can 
immediately start sending email to friends, relatives, and co-workers all over the 
planet. The more people you contact, the more likely you’ll get interesting email 
from people you want to hear from in return, and that can make everyone happy.

Typing plain ol’ text in an email message 
may be functional, but it’s also a bit boring. To 
make your email look prettier, the Mail program 
includes stationery and signatures. The statio-
nery feature provides pretty graphics for hold-
ing text and pictures. Signatures let you include 
text at the end of every message you send, such 
as your name and phone number or a funny 
saying that you want to share with others.

signature can display a funny saying or your company’s name, your title, and your 
phone number so that anyone receiving your message can contact you. To use a 
signature, you must first create the text you want to appear. Next, you must tell 
Mail to add your signature to your messages.

Additional Ideas for Making Email Look 
Pretty
The Mail program organizes stationery into categories, but it also includes a 
Favorites category where you can drag your favorite stationery so you won’t have 
to hunt through the stationery categories every time. If you find the stationery 
selections provided by Mail too limiting, you can buy additional stationery from 
Equinux (http://www.equinux.com/). If you have technical expertise, you can 
even create your own stationery by reading Apple’s stationery creation guide, 
“Creating Mail Stationery Bundles” (http://developer.apple.com/documentation/
AppleApplications/Conceptual/MailArticles).
If you want to spice up your email messages with signatures, create several 
signatures that display a saying or phrase to share with others. By creating sev-
eral signature files and letting Mail choose them randomly or in sequential order, 
everyone receiving your messages can receive different signatures.
If you’re adding a signature for business use, include your company name, 
motto, and website address to promote your business every time you send email. 
Since recipients may forward your email messages to others (including the text of 
your signature file), this can be a free form of advertising.
When you use stationery or signatures (or both), there’s no reason for your 
email messages to be plain and boring. Now all you have to do is make sure your 
messages are worth reading in the first place.

All new email messages usually appear in your 
Inbox folder. However, the more messages you 
get, the more crowded your Inbox folder can 
become, so it can be difficult to find anything.
To solve this problem, the Mail program can 
help you sort, search, and organize your email. 
By sorting and searching your email, you can 
stay as disorganized as you want and still find 
what you need. By organizing your messages 
into folders, you’ll always be able to find what 
you want without wasting time searching for it.

Searching for Messages
When searching for a message, you can specify the text you want to find and the 
location of that text. For example, you might only want to find messages from a 
certain person or messages about a particular topic. You can search the following 
three locations:
>
>
From  Finds all messages sent by certain people
>
>
Subject  Finds all messages related to a specific topic
>
>
Message  Finds all messages that contain certain text

Here’s how to search for a message:
1.	
Start the Mail program.
2.	
Click in the Search text field that appears in the upper-right corner of the 
Mail window.
3.	
Type the text you want to find. As you type, Mail displays matching mes-
sages organized into categories such as people or subject, as shown in 
­Figure 47-2. 
4.	
Click a message to read it.
5.	
Click the close button of the Search text field to clear the box. All your mes-
sages appear in the order they were in before you started your search.
Using Smart Mailboxes
Typing text into the Search text box to find certain messages can get tedious. To 
simplify this process, you can create a Smart Mailbox, which lets you define the 
type of messages you want to find. Every time a new message matches the criteria 
you have selected, that message appears inside your Smart Mailbox in the left 
pane of the Mail window, which updates its list of messages automatically as you 
add or delete messages.
Q
Q Note: A Smart Mailbox doesn’t physically move messages out of your Inbox 
folder. Instead, the Smart Mailbox simply provides a link to messages stored 
in your Inbox folder.

4.	
Click Delete. The chosen Smart Mailbox disappears.
Q
Q Note: Deleting a Smart Mailbox doesn’t physically delete any messages, 
since those same messages still appear in your Inbox.
Using Rules to Sort Messages
Another way to organize messages is to use rules. A rule defines what type of mes-
sage you want to look for, such as messages from certain email addresses, and 
then routes those messages to a separate folder instead of the Inbox folder.
Q
Q Note: Smart Mailboxes contain links to messages physically stored in the 
Inbox folder. Rules physically move messages into a specific folder.
Creating a Folder for Sorted Messages
Here’s how to create a folder to hold messages sorted by rules:

Creating Rules
Rules tell the Mail program how to route certain messages into different folders. 
For example, you might create one rule for routing messages from co-workers into 
one folder and a second rule for routing messages from your friends into another 
folder. Here’s how to create a rule:
1.	
Start the Mail program.
2.	
Select MailPreferences. A Preferences window appears.
3.	
Click the Rules icon. The Rules window appears, as shown in Figure 47-6. 
4.	
Click Add Rule. A Rules dialog appears, as shown in Figure 47-7.
5.	
Click in the Description text box and type a descriptive name for your rule.
6.	
Click the If pop-up menu and choose any or all. If you create two or more rules, 
the all option routes only messages that match all your defined conditions. The 
any option routes messages if they match one or more defined conditions.
Figure 47-6: The Rules window lets you create and manage 
rules for routing messages.
Figure 47-7: The Rules dialog displays pop-up menus and 
text boxes for describing the type of messages you want to 
route into another folder.

Chapter 47
7.	
Click the first pop-up menu (which usually displays the option Any Recipient) 
and choose an option for how to identify and route a message, such as 
From, Subject, Date Received, etc., as shown in Figure 47-8.
8.	
Click the second pop-up menu (which usually displays the word Contains) 
and choose how to apply the rule, such as Contains, Begins with, or 
Ends with.
9.	
Click in the text box that appears next and type the text for your condition. 
An example of a condition using the previous two pop-up menus might look 
like this: From Contains Fred, which would identify all messages whose From 
field contained Fred.
10.	
(Optional) Click the plus button to create another rule and repeat the pre-
ceding steps.
11.	
Make sure the first pop-up menu under Perform the following actions dis-
plays the words Move Message.
12.	
Click the to mailbox pop-up menu and choose the mailbox you want to 
route your messages to.
13.	
Click OK. Now all messages that match your rule will be moved automatically 
to your chosen mailbox.

then click the close button of the Preferences window. (Or click Remove, 
and when another dialog appears, click Remove again.)
Q
Q Note: If you delete a folder that contains messages routed there by a rule, 
you will physically delete any messages stored in that folder.
Additional Ideas for Organizing Email
If you don’t want to take time to organize your email, you can stick to sorting (by 
clicking column headings such as From, Subject, and Date Received) and searching 
(by typing text in the Search text box in the upper-right corner of the Mail window). 
If you’re willing to take time to organize your email, use Smart Mailboxes 
and rules. Since Smart Mailboxes create links to messages physically stored in the 
Inbox folder, you can look for messages in both the Smart Mailbox and the Inbox 
folder. If you prefer reducing clutter, use rules to move messages physically into 
specific folders.
Both Smart Mailboxes and rules help you organize your email into catego-
ries. If you shop online, you can create a Smart Mailbox or folder to hold any email 
verifications you receive from merchants such as Amazon.com. That way, browsing 
the messages in that Smart Mailbox or folder can show you when you placed your 
order and when your order delivery was promised.
If you’re looking for a job and waiting to hear from certain companies, route 
their emails into their own folder so you won’t miss them when they arrive. If you’re 
involved in a long-distance romance, route your lover’s email messages to a folder 
so you can read and reread them all easily.
Staying organized may not be easy, but the consequences of not doing so 
can mean missed messages, which could lead to lost opportunities or missed 
deadlines. So take time now to make Mail organize your messages automatically. 
You’ll be glad you did.

If you have an email account, you’ll eventually 
start receiving junk email. To avoid wasting time 
deleting junk email manually, you can make the 
Mail program identify or even delete most junk 
email automatically. That way, Mail can show you 
only the important messages without annoying 
you with the junk.
Project goal: Learn different ways to 
make the Mail program handle junk email 
automatically.

Junk Email

What You’ll Be Using
To handle junk email messages, you’ll use the following:
>
>
The Mail program configured to work with your email account
>
>
An Internet connection
Using Junk Mail Filtering
To deal with the inevitable flood of junk email every email account receives, the 
Mail program includes built-in junk mail filtering. To use Mail’s junk mail filtering, 
you need to turn it on, tell Mail what to do with junk mail, and tell Mail how to iden-
tify junk mail.
Configuring the Junk Mail Filter
By default, Mail’s junk mail filter is turned on, but here’s how you can turn it off or 
on and modify how the filter behaves:
1.	
Start the Mail program. (Click the Mail icon on the Dock or double-click the 
Mail icon in the Applications folder.)
2.	
Select MailPreferences. A Preferences window appears.
3.	
Click the Junk Mail button. A Junk Mail window appears, as shown in 
Figure 48-1.
Figure 48-1: The Junk Mail window lets you configure Mail’s 
filter.

	
Dealing with Junk Email	
|	 407
4.	
Select or clear the Enable junk mail filtering checkbox, which is initially 
checked by default. If you remove the checkmark, Mail won’t filter out 
junk mail.
5.	
Click a radio button under the When junk mail arrives group. You have three 
choices:
>
>
Mark as junk mail, but leave it in my Inbox  Identifies junk mail but 
lets you decide to delete it manually
>
>
Move it to the Junk mailbox  Automatically routes junk mail to a 
special Junk mailbox folder, which is created for you automatically; Mail 
may also mistakenly route valid email into the Junk mailbox folder
>
>
Perform custom actions  Lets you define additional rules for identi-
fying and routing junk mail 
6.	
(Optional) Select or clear any checkboxes under The following types of 
messages are exempt from junk mail filtering. By default, all of these check-
boxes are selected, since Mail assumes if the sender is in your Address Book 
or knows your full name, the message probably isn’t junk.
7.	
(Optional) Select or clear the Trust junk mail headers in messages check-
box. Most email accounts also use built-in junk mail filters and can label sus-
picious messages as junk in the message headers, which helps Mail identify 
and filter junk mail more effectively.
8.	
Click the close button of the Junk Mail window.
Identifying Junk Mail
After you’ve configured Mail’s junk filter, Mail can identify most junk mail, but some 
junk mail will still slip past. When you find junk mail that Mail’s filters have missed, 
you can manually label the message as junk, which helps “train” Mail to recognize 
similar junk email in the future. When Mail recognizes a junk mail message, it dis-
plays that message in a different color. 
To identify junk mail manually (or remove an incorrect junk mail label from a 
valid message), do the following:
1.	
Click a message that Mail’s junk mail filter missed.
2.	
Select MessageMarkAs Junk Mail (or click the Junk button at the top 
of the Mail window; it looks like a thumbs down). The preview pane displays 
You marked this message as Junk Mail, as shown in Figure 48-2.
3.	
(Optional) If a message is labeled as junk mail by mistake, click the Not Junk 
button (it looks like a thumbs up).

408	 |	
Chapter 48
Deleting Junk Mail
After you’ve identified junk mail, you can delete junk messages manually by doing 
the following:
1.	
Click the junk email message you want to delete (or hold down the  key as 
you click multiple messages).
2.	
Select EditDelete (or click the Trash icon at the top of the Mail window).
If you configured Mail to route suspected junk messages to a Junk mailbox 
folder automatically, you should browse through this Junk mailbox folder periodi-
cally to look for any valid messages mistakenly identified as junk by Mail’s filters. 
When you’re sure the Junk mailbox folder only contains useless messages, empty 
your Junk mailbox folder by selecting MailboxErase Junk Mail.
Additional Ideas for Dealing with Junk Email
Junk email is inevitable. The simplest way to avoid junk mail is to give out your 
email address only to trusted friends.
Since many online merchants ask for your email address, you could create 
and use a free email account (through Yahoo! or another free email account com-
pany) and use these “dummy” email addresses whenever you need to give out 
an email address. If junk mail overwhelms your free email account, you can simply 
shut it down and create a new one.
Junk email will always be a nuisance, like death and taxes, but with Mail’s 
built-in junk mail filtering, you can reduce a potential flood of junk email into a 
manageable trickle.

Usually the fastest way to talk to someone is 
through a phone, but phone calls can be dull, 
especially when you’re talking to someone 
you’re close to and you would like to actually 
see that person. To chat with someone through 
video, you can use FaceTime.
With FaceTime, you can video chat with any-
one who has a Macintosh, iPhone, iPad, or iPod 
touch. To chat with an iPhone user, you just 
need that person’s iPhone phone number. To 
chat with a Macintosh, iPad, or iPod touch user, 
you just need that person’s email address. By 
using FaceTime, you can video chat with any-
one who has a Wi-Fi or cellular phone connec-
tion and a compatible FaceTime device.

Q
Q Note: FaceTime won’t work with older devices such as older iPhones, iPod 
touches, or iPads.
Setting Up a FaceTime Account
Before someone can call you through FaceTime, you must set up a free FaceTime 
account (or Apple ID), which relies on your email address to identify your Macin-
tosh. When people using an iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, or Macintosh want to chat 
with you through FaceTime, they can call you using your email address. If you’ve 
already registered your email address as your Apple ID, skip ahead to the next sec-
tion. Otherwise, to set up a FaceTime account, do this:
1.	
Click the FaceTime icon on the Dock. (If you don’t see the FaceTime icon on 
the Dock, click the Finder icon on the Dock, click Applications in the side­
bar of the Finder window, and then double-click the FaceTime icon.)
2.	
Click the Create New Account button. A New Account pane appears, as 
shown in Figure 49-1. 
Figure 49-1: The New Account pane lets you define an 
identifying email address.

3.	
Type all the required information, such as your name, birthday, password, etc. 
4.	
Click the Next button. FaceTime is ready for use.
From now on, every time you start FaceTime, you’ll need to type your pass-
word and click the Sign In button. However, you do not need to be signed in (or 
even have FaceTime running) to accept a FaceTime call from someone else.
Accepting a FaceTime Call
After you have defined an email address 
for your FaceTime account, anyone can use 
that email address to contact you through 
FaceTime using an iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, 
or Macintosh. When someone wants to start 
a FaceTime video chat, a FaceTime window 
appears, as shown in Figure 49-2.
Click Accept or Decline. If you accept 
the call, you’ll be able to start chatting 
right away.
Temporarily Turning 
FaceTime Off
Since FaceTime will interrupt you whenever 
anyone tries to initiate a FaceTime chat, you 
might want to block incoming calls (so you 
don’t have to keep declining them). To turn 
off FaceTime and block all incoming Face-
Time calls, do this:
1.	
Start FaceTime.
2.	
Select FaceTimeTurn FaceTime Off. 
To turn FaceTime back on again, repeat the above steps but choose Turn 
FaceTime On.
Making a Call with FaceTime
To call an iPhone user, you must have that person’s iPhone number stored in your 
Address Book. To call a Macintosh, iPad, or iPod touch user, you must have that 
person’s email address stored in your Address Book. 
Every time someone tries to call you, FaceTime records that person’s Face-
Time identifier (a phone number for an iPhone user and an email address for every-
one else). By clicking a saved FaceTime account identifier, you can call someone 
back, even if you don’t have that person’s iPhone number or email addresses 
stored in your Address Book.
Figure 49-2: A FaceTime 
window appears, giving 
you the option to accept or 
decline the call.

Additional Ideas for Using FaceTime
Since you can see the other person, FaceTime can be especially handy for deaf 
and hard-of-hearing people, who can use FaceTime to communicate through sign 
language.
Students can study through FaceTime by showing their notes to each other, 
while technicians can use FaceTime to troubleshoot equipment. Just show a tech-
nician what the problem is and they can tell you what to do while watching your 
actions at the same time.
With so many Apple products sporting webcams these days, you’ll be able 
to reach out and chat with many people, whether they’re sitting in front of a Macin-
tosh computer or roaming around with an iPhone, iPod touch, or iPad. 
Let your imagination go wild: Use FaceTime to share video moments with 
others, whether it’s sharing birthday moments with people unable to attend in per-
son or showing your friends where you’re vacationing right now so you won’t have 
to wait until you get back to bore them with pictures or videos.
Q
Q Note: FaceTime only works with Apple devices, but you can video chat with 
non-Apple users by using a program like iChat (see Chapter 50) or Skype 
(http://www.skype.com/). 
FaceTime makes video chatting easy. Now, you just have to figure out what 
to say and how to look good as you’re saying it.

Sending and receiving email is a fun way to 
communicate with your friends and family 
members, but sometimes you may want ins­tant 
communication. To satisfy your need for real-
time communication, every Macintosh comes 
with a program called iChat. With iChat, you 
have a choice of chatting using text, audio, or 
video. Unlike FaceTime (see Chapter 49), iChat 
lets you engage in video chats with people who 
may be using non-Apple devices, such as a PC 
running Windows or Linux.
Text chatting lets you type messages, audio 
messaging lets you use your Macintosh like a 
telephone, and video messaging lets you see 
who you’re talking to. If you want to stay in 
touch, iChat can help you do it with nothing 
more than a high-speed Internet connection.

What You’ll Be Using
To learn how to communicate with iChat on your Macintosh, you’ll use the following:
>
>
The iChat program
>
>
An Internet connection
Setting Up an iChat Account
Before you can use iChat, you need to set up an iChat account, which you can do 
in one of three ways:
>
>
Use an existing MobileMe email account.
>
>
Create or use an existing AOL Instant Messenger (AIM) account.
>
>
Create or use an existing Google Talk or Gmail account (the latter includes 
an instant messaging function, so if you already have a Gmail account, you 
don’t need to create a separate Google Talk account).
An AIM (http://www.aim.com/), Gmail (http://mail.google.com/), Google Talk 
(http://www.google.com/talk/), or Yahoo! (http://mail.yahoo.com/) account is com-
pletely free to create. If you have an old MobileMe account, you can use that too. 
You only need to create an AIM, Gmail, Google Talk, or Yahoo! account once. If 
you don’t already have one of these accounts or if you’re unsure of which kind of 
account to create first, ask your friends what they use.
Q
Q Note: You can also use a Jabber or an older .Mac account. If you don’t 
know what Jabber or .Mac are, then just stick with using an AIM, Gmail, 
or MobileMe account.
You don’t have to choose one or the other. By using iChat, you can chat 
with people who use a different instant messenger service. For example, if you 
sign onto iChat using an AIM account, you can also chat with your friends who use 
Google Talk or Yahoo!. If you have more than one type of account, you can sign 
onto iChat with all of them at the same time too.
To set up your iChat account, do this:
1.	
Click the iChat icon on the Dock. (If you don’t see the iChat icon on the Dock, 
click the Finder icon on the Dock, click Applications in the sidebar of the 
Finder window, and then double-click the iChat icon.) A Welcome dialog 
appears.
2.	
Click the Continue button. An Account Setup dialog appears, as shown in 
Figure 50-1. 
Q
Q Note: If you use a MobileMe account to set up iChat, you’ll have the option 
of using encryption to protect your text, audio, and video chats with other 
MobileMe users.

Click the Account Type pop-up menu and choose an option such as AIM, 
Google Talk, or MobileMe.
4.	
Click in the Username text box and type your username or email address. 
(If you selected MobileMe in the previous step, then click in the MobileMe 
Name text box and type your MobileMe account name.)
5.	
Click in the Password text box and type the password for your account.
6.	
Click the Continue button. A dialog appears, letting you know that you have 
finished setting up your iChat account.
7.	
Click the Done button. 
Q
Q Note: You can repeat this process for any other chatting accounts you’d like 
to add. Just select iChatPreferences, then click the Accounts button. To add 
another account, click the plus button in the lower-left corner. You can delete 
accounts using the minus button.
Starting iChat
After you’ve set up an iChat account, you’ll be ready to start chatting with your 
friends. First, make sure you’re connected to the Internet. Then start up iChat 
using one of these methods:
>
>
Click the iChat icon on the Dock.

Chapter 50
To communicate through iChat, you must have iChat running on your com-
puter and the other person must have iChat (or a compatible instant messenger 
program such as AIM) running on their computer. With iChat running, you can either 
wait for someone to call you or you can take the initiative to call someone else.
Calling Someone Through iChat
The simplest way to use iChat is to simply type in the instant messenger address of 
the person you want to reach, as follows:
1.	
Start iChat. 
2.	
Select FileNew Chat. A New Chat window appears, as shown in 
Figure 50-2.
Q
Q Note: If you have defined multiple accounts to work with iChat, you can click 
the From pop-up menu and choose the account you want to use. If you have 
only defined one account to work with iChat, that account name appears in 
the From pop-up menu.
3.	
Click the Type pop-up menu and choose the type of chat you want, such as 
Text Chat, Audio Chat, or Video Chat.
4.	
Click in the To text field and type the instant messenger name of the person 
you want to reach.
5.	
Click the Chat button.
If the person you’re trying to reach wants to chat, you’ll be able to start typ-
ing or talking right away.
Adding a Name to Your Buddy List
Typing each person’s instant messenger name (usually their email address) when 
you want to chat can be cumbersome and inaccurate. To simplify this task, just 
store each person’s name and instant messenger name in a Buddy List so you can 
contact them easily without remembering and typing their account name. To add 
a name to the Buddy List, do this:
1.	
Start iChat.
2.	
Click the plus button in the bottom-left corner of the Buddy List window. A 
pop-up menu appears, as shown in Figure 50-3.

Chatting with Others in iChat
With iChat, you have three ways to communicate with others. If you just want to 
type messages back and forth, choose a text chat. If you just want to talk to each 
other and mimic a telephone, choose audio chat. If you want to talk to each other 
and see each other at the same time, choose video chat.

Starting a Text Chat
A text chat lets you type messages back and forth. Text messaging is best when 
using a slow Internet connection or when you’re chatting with someone who 
doesn’t have a microphone or webcam that would allow them to participate in 
an audio or video chat.
To start a text chat, do this:
1.	
Start iChat.
2.	
Click the name of a Buddy in your Buddy List who is currently online.
3.	
Click the Start a Text Chat icon at the bottom of the Buddy List window, as 
shown in Figure 50-5. A Text Chat window appears.
4.	
Click in the text field at the bottom of the Text Chat window, type a mes-
sage, and then press the return key. Your messages and your friend’s mes-
sages will appear in the scrolling Text Chat window.
5.	
Click the close button in the Text Chat window when you want to quit 
chatting.
Starting an Audio Chat
An audio chat lets you turn your Macintosh into a telephone, as long as the other 
person also has a microphone and speakers. To start an audio chat, do this:
1.	
Start iChat.
2.	
Click the name of a Buddy in your Buddy List who is currently online.

Starting a Video Chat
A video chat lets you talk and see the other person, just as long as that other 
person has a webcam, a microphone, and speakers. Video chats work best with 
high-speed Internet connections, while text chats are ideal for slower Internet con-
nections. To start a video chat, do this:
1.	
Start iChat.
2.	
Click the name of a Buddy in your Buddy List who is currently online.
3.	
Click the Start a Video Chat icon at the bottom of the Buddy List window,

Additional Ideas for Using iChat
The text messaging feature of iChat is perfect when you’re stuck in a boring lec-
ture or meeting and want to act like you’re typing notes, but are really just chatting 
with your friends and making plans for the weekend.
Audio chats are great for times when you want to talk to others but don’t 
want to waste the money on long-distance phone calls. If you have a high-speed 
Internet connection, you might want to choose a video chat so you can see the 
other person and chat at the same time. Of course, this means having to stare 
at the other person and having them stare back at you, so if this makes you 
uncomfortable, you might prefer an audio chat, which more closely mimics a 
telephone call.
Perhaps one of the most advanced features of iChat is the Share a Screen 
option, which literally lets you control someone else’s Macintosh (or vice versa). 
This is great for when you need help and want someone to show you exactly which 
icons or menus to click, or if you want to show someone else how to use their 
Macintosh without having to drive over to that person’s home or office.
The Share a Screen feature requires a high-speed Internet connection, but 
by talking to someone and moving their mouse pointer on the screen, you can 
remotely teach that person what to do, so they can quickly learn all the joys of 
using a Macintosh.

Maintaining 
Your Mac


51
Look on the side of any software package and 
you’ll see the words System Requirements atop 
a list that defines the minimum hardware (hard 
disk size, memory) and software (OS X version) 
requirements that your Macintosh must meet 
to run that particular software. System require-
ments are useful, but only if you know enough 
about your Macintosh in the first place. If you 
don’t know which version of the Mac OS X 
operating system your computer is running or 
how much memory your computer has avail-
able, these system requirements won’t mean a 
whole lot.
If you want to upgrade your computer’s 
memory, you need to know which types of 
memory chips it uses. If you want to buy acces-
sories for your Macintosh, you need to know 
which model you have so you can buy the right

equipment. In the old days, trying to dig up this information was a pain in the neck, 
but with Mac OS X 10.7 Lion, your Macintosh can tell you all this information easily.
Project goal: Determine what OS X version your Macintosh uses and learn 
about your Mac’s hardware.
What You’ll Be Using
To examine your Macintosh, you’ll use the following:
>
>
The Finder
>
>
The System Profiler program
Identifying Your Operating System Version, 
Processor Type, and Memory
The latest Macintosh computers use Mac OS X 10.7 Lion as their operating system. 
However, Apple constantly releases updates, so by the time you read this, your 
Macintosh may be running version 10.7.1 or 10.7.5. Since many programs won’t 
work if your computer uses a version of Mac OS X that doesn’t meet the software 
publisher’s requirements, you need to know exactly which version your computer 
is running before you buy any software or accessories that might not run on your 
computer.
To identify the version of the Mac OS X operating system you’re using, do this:
1.	
Click the Apple menu and choose About This Mac. An About This Mac 
window appears, as shown in Figure 51-1.
2.	
Click the close button of the About This Mac window.

Identifying Your Macintosh Serial Number
Since Macintosh computers are so popular, they also attract the attention of 
thieves. As soon as you get a Macintosh computer, write down its serial number 
so you can identify your Macintosh in case it’s ever stolen and recovered.
To identify the serial number of your Macintosh, do this:
1.	
Click the Apple menu and choose About This Mac. An About This Mac 
window appears (see Figure 51-1).
2.	
Click the More Info button. An Overview window appears, listing your 
Macintosh’s serial number, model, operating system version, and other 
details, as shown in Figure 51-2.
3.	
Click the close button of the About This Mac window.
Identifying Your Monitor’s Resolution
Some programs, such as games or graphics-intensive programs like computer-
aided design (CAD) software, can only run on computer monitors that offer a spe-
cific resolution, that is, the number of pixels (dots) that your screen displays. The 
higher the resolution, the sharper the picture.
To see the resolution of your monitor, do this:
1.	
Click the Apple menu and choose About This Mac. An About This Mac 
window appears (see Figure 51-1).
2.	
Click the More Info button. An Overview window appears (see Figure 51-2).
3.	
Click the Displays tab. The About This Mac window displays your monitor’s 
maximum resolution, as shown in Figure 51-3.

Identifying Your Hard Disk’s Free Space
No matter how big a computer’s hard disk might be, most people will always find 
a way to fill it up. In case you’re wondering how much free space you have left or 
what type of files are cluttering up your hard disk, your Macintosh can show you 
a color-coded picture of what audio files or applications are taking up the most 
room on your hard disk.
To see what’s taking up the most space on your hard disk and how much free 
space you might have left, do this:
1.	
Click the Apple menu and choose About This Mac. An About This Mac 
window appears (see Figure 51-1).
2.	
Click the More Info button. An Overview window appears (see Figure 51-2).
3.	
Click the Storage tab. The About This Mac window displays your hard disk’s 
storage capabilities, as shown in Figure 51-4.
4.	
Click the close button of the About This Mac window.
Identifying Your Macintosh’s Memory (RAM)
If you want to upgrade your computer’s memory, you must buy the right kind of 
RAM. Fortunately, you can easily find this information by doing this:
1.	
Click the Apple menu and choose About This Mac. An About This Mac 
window appears (see Figure 51-1).
Figure 51-3: The Displays tab shows your monitor’s maximum 
resolution.

Additional Ideas
Before you buy any software or accessories, check their system requirements first. 
Then make sure that your Macintosh has the correct operating system version, 
monitor resolution, storage capacity, and memory requirements. If you don’t check 
this information before buying a new program or accessory, it’s possible that your 
Macintosh won’t be able to use your new software or hardware accessory.
Knowing the type of Macintosh you have can also help troubleshoot prob-
lems. For example, if you want to use some new feature of Mac OS X 10.7 Lion, 
such as AirDrop, but suddenly find that it doesn’t seem to be available on your 
Macintosh, chances are good your Macintosh simply doesn’t meet the system 
requirements. In the case of AirDrop, only the latest Macintosh computers can use 
this feature, so if you know your Macintosh isn’t new enough, you can save yourself 
hours of frustration trying to troubleshoot this problem.
By using the About This Mac window, you can quickly dig into the guts of 
your Macintosh and identify useful technical information without knowing any 
obscure commands.

Whether you’re concerned about global warm-
ing or just your electricity bill, you can conserve 
energy with your Macintosh. Every computer 
needs electricity to work, but too often people 
leave computers running when they’re not 
using them, which gobbles up power unnec-
essarily. While you could turn your computer 
off and then on again when you need it, doing 
so several times a day can actually harm your 
computer since every time you turn it back on 
again, it receives a jolt of electricity to start it up.
As a safer alternative to turning your Mac­
intosh on and off repeatedly, you can let it go 
to sleep when it’s not in use. This reduces the 
amount of power consumed by your Macintosh, 
yet keeps it ready for use at the touch of the 
keyboard.
Conserving Energy 
While Using Your 
Macintosh

Chapter 52
When your Macintosh is turned on, it needs power to spin its hard disk, dis-
play images on the screen, and do actual work with its processor. Such normal use 
typically consumes 60 to 120 watts, which is about the same amount of power used 
by an ordinary light bulb. However, if you let your Macintosh go to sleep, you can 
reduce the amount of power it uses to 5 watts or less.
Project goal: Learn how to conserve power by letting your Macintosh go to 
sleep.
What You’ll Be Using
To make a Macintosh sleep and wake up, you’ll use the following:
>
>
The System Preferences program
Sleepy Time
To define when your Mac automatically goes to sleep, you’ll need to define the 
inactivity time, which is the amount of time your Macintosh waits after it detects 
no activity (such as your moving the mouse or typing) before going to sleep. 
Everyone has his or her own idea of the most appropriate inactivity period. Some 
people use a short inactivity period, such as 10 minutes, but you may find that’s 
too short and your Macintosh will actually go to sleep while you’re reading some-
thing on the screen. On the other hand, if you define a long inactivity time, such as 
2 hours, your computer could waste electricity while you’re away from it. Around 
15 to 30 minutes can be a reasonable amount of inactivity time, but see what works 
for you.
Q
Q Note: You can define separate inactivity times for your computer and your 
monitor. You may find it convenient to set a shorter inactivity time for your 
display since it will wake up faster than your computer.  
To define an inactivity time for your computer and display, and to make your 
Macintosh’s hard disk go to sleep whenever possible, do the following:
1.	
Click the Apple menu and select System Preferences. The System Prefer­
ences window appears.
2.	
Click the Energy Saver icon under the Hardware category. The Energy Saver 
window appears, as shown in Figure 52-1.
3.	
(Optional) If you have a laptop, you’ll see two tabs labeled Battery and Power 
Adapter. This lets you define different sleep settings for when your laptop 
is running off its battery or its power adapter. Click the Battery or Power 
Adapter tab.
4.	
Drag the Computer sleep slider to specify a time, such as 15 minutes. This 
slider defines when to put the processor to sleep.
5.	
Drag the Display sleep slider to specify a time, such as 15 minutes. This 
slider defines when to put the monitor to sleep (it tends to consume the 
most electricity).

6.	
Select or clear the Put the hard disk(s) to sleep when possible checkbox. 
If selected, this option waits until the hard disk isn’t busy to put it to sleep. 
7.	
Click the close button on the Energy Saver window.
Q
Q Note: To wake up a Macintosh that’s sleeping, just tap any key on the 
keyboard.
Forcing Your Macintosh to Sleep
If you know you’re going to be away from your Macintosh, you can wait for your 
Macintosh to go to sleep automatically or you can make it go to sleep right away.
If you have a laptop, the fastest way to make it go to sleep is to close the 
screen. 
Of course, you can’t close up a desktop like a laptop, but you can use a 
shortcut keystroke combination that works on both desktops and laptops by just 
pressing option-z-eject.
Making Your Macintosh Sleep (and Start) on 
a Schedule
If you’re regularly away from your Macintosh at certain times of the day, you can 
make your Macintosh fall asleep according to a particular schedule, such as during 
your lunch. Then you can have your Macintosh automatically wake itself at a certain 
time as well, such as when you normally return from lunch. 
Figure 52-1: The Energy Saver window lets you define an 
inactivity time for the computer and display.

Here’s how to schedule a time to make your Macintosh sleep and wake up:
1.	
Click the Apple menu and select System Preferences. The System Prefer­
ences window appears.
2.	
Click the Energy Saver icon under the Hardware category. An Energy Saver 
window appears (see Figure 52-1).

a time, such as 5:15 pm.
10.	
Click OK. The Energy Saver window appears again.
11.	
Click the close button of the Energy Saver window.
Additional Ideas for Conserving Energy
To conserve even more energy when using your computer, consider using a laptop 
instead of a desktop, since laptop models tend to use less electricity. You can even 
attach a mouse, keyboard, and monitor to a laptop so you can use a bigger screen 
and keyboard at your desk while still having the option of carrying your laptop 
around wherever you need it.
Don’t forget to shut down your Mac when you know you won’t be using it for 
an extended period of time, such as over the weekend or when you’re on vacation. 
Figure 52-2: The scheduling sheet lets you 
define a wake-up and sleep time.

On older computers, you loaded a CD or DVD 
by opening a CD/DVD tray, dropping your disc 
in that tray, and sliding the tray back into your 
computer. The latest Macintosh computers 
have eliminated the tray and let you load a CD 
or DVD just by sliding the disc into a slot. While 
this requires fewer moving parts (and fewer 
parts that could break), the biggest disadvan-
tage of the CD/DVD slot is that sometimes the 
disc can get stuck inside your computer with no 
physical way of yanking it back out again. 
If a disc gets stuck in your computer, your 
Macintosh offers a variety of ways to eject it. By 
trying each method, you can eventually eject 
a stuck disc without having to call for help or 
physically harming your Macintosh.
Project goal: Learn how to eject a CD or 
DVD that’s stuck inside your Macintosh and 
refuses to eject.

>
Press the eject key on the keyboard.
>
>
Drag the CD/DVD icon from the desktop to the Trash icon on the Dock.
>
>
Click the eject button that appears to the right of a CD or DVD in the iTunes

Whenever you want to eject a CD or DVD, try one of these three methods. 
(Stick a CD or DVD in your Macintosh right now and try all three methods, one after 
the other, to see how they work.)
How to Eject a Stuck CD or DVD
One of the biggest problems with a stuck CD or DVD is that its icon may not 
appear on the desktop or in the Finder or iTunes window. Even though you know 
the CD/DVD is stuck in your Macintosh, none of the other programs may recog-
nize the CD/DVD, and thus you won’t be able to eject the disc using the normal 
methods.

and DVDs. Here’s how to use Disk Utility to eject a stuck CD or DVD:
1.	
Click the Finder icon on the Dock. The Finder window appears.
2.	
Select GoUtilities. A Finder window appears, displaying the contents of 
the Utilities folder.
3.	
Double-click the Disk Utility icon. The Disk Utility window appears, as 
shown in Figure 53-2.

Eject from the Terminal Program
The Terminal program gives you access to the guts of your Macintosh without the 
fancy user interface of windows, menus, and buttons. Here’s how to use the Termi-
nal program to eject a CD or DVD:
1.	
Click the Finder icon on the Dock. The Finder window appears.
2.	
Select GoUtilities.
3.	
Double-click the Terminal icon. The Terminal window appears, as shown in

5.	
Select TerminalQuit Terminal.
Restart and Hold Down the Left Mouse Button
If you hold down the left mouse button while your Macintosh is starting up, it will 
often eject a CD or DVD stuck inside. Here’s how to use this method:
1.	
Click the Apple menu and select Restart. (If your Macintosh won’t let you 
access the Apple menu, press the Mac’s power button or press control-
eject key to display the dialog. Then click Restart.)
2.	
Hold down the left mouse button as your Macintosh restarts. (Start hold-
ing down the left mouse button immediately after you choose the Restart 
command in the preceding step. If you’re using a trackpad, hold down the 
trackpad.)

Additional Ideas for Ejecting and 
Preventing Stuck CDs or DVDs
To prevent CDs and DVDs from getting stuck in your Macintosh, clean your discs 
periodically. Sometimes dirt on the discs can keep your Macintosh from reading 
them correctly. If a disc is scratched, you may need to get a replacement disc or 
else it might get jammed in your Macintosh again.
Although stuck CDs and DVDs may be an occasional minor inconvenience, 
you will generally be able to rely on your Macintosh. However, if you try all of the 
methods listed in this project and still can’t eject your CD/DVD, your CD/DVD drive 
may have physical problems that will require repairs or a replacement, so take your 
Macintosh to a repair shop and let the technicians worry about it.

Nobody wants strangers peeking at their files, 
messing up their settings, or wiping out their 
data. To protect your Macintosh from prying 
eyes, you could lock it behind closed doors, 
and perhaps you do. However, if this isn’t pos­
sible (or desirable), try the next best solution 
and password protect your Macintosh instead.
Password protection keeps people from 
accessing your Macintosh unless they know 
your password. (When you first unpacked your 
Macintosh and turned it on, you had to type 
your name and a password.) Password pro-
tection is like locking your front door: It won’t 
guarantee that intruders will stay out, but it can 
slow them down.
Project goal: Lock out anyone who doesn’t 
know your password.

What You’ll Be Using
To password protect your Macintosh, you need to use the following:
>
>
The System Preferences program
Password Protecting Screensaver and Sleep 
Mode
To protect your computer, you should password protect your screensaver and 
sleep mode. If you don’t do this and you walk away from your computer, your 
screensaver can start up or your Macintosh may go to sleep. Anyone can wake 
your Macintosh out of screensaver or sleep mode and access your files.
By password protecting both your screensaver and sleep mode, you can 
safely walk away from your computer. The moment you return, tap a key to exit 
out of screensaver or sleep mode. Type your password and access your computer 
once more. 
To password protect your screensaver and sleep mode, do the following:
1.	
Click the Apple menu and choose System Preferences. The System Prefer-
ences window appears.
2.	
Click the Security & Privacy icon under the Personal category. The Secu-
rity & Privacy window appears.
3.	
Click the General tab to view the General options.
4.	
Click the lock icon in the bottom-left corner of the Security & Privacy win-
dow. (Skip this step if the lock icon already appears opened.) When a dialog 
appears, type your password and click OK.
5.	
Select the Require password after sleep or screen saver begins check-
box, as shown in Figure 54-1.
6.	
Click the Require password pop-up menu and choose a time, such as 
immediately, 15 minutes, or 5 seconds.
7.	
Click the close button of the Security & Privacy window.
Password Protecting System Preferences
The System Preferences window is another area of your computer that you can 
password protect, and it’s an important one. It provides access to settings that 
determine how your Macintosh behaves. You don’t want just any user (such as your 
10-year-old son) to change the way your mouse or keyboard works or make your 
Macintosh start up using a different hard disk, for example. If someone accesses 
the System Preferences window without your knowledge, he or she can literally 
change your Macintosh. Think of the System Preferences window as the keys to 
your computer’s “house”; you wouldn’t give these keys to just anyone, nor would 
you give them tools for ripping out the carpet and knocking down the walls.

2.	
Click the Security & Privacy icon under the Personal category. The Secu-
rity & Privacy window appears.
3.

preferences with lock icons checkbox.
6.	
Click the close button of the Security & Privacy window.
Disabling Automatic Login
Every Macintosh consists of at least one user account, which you set up when you 
first started using your new Macintosh. The user account acts like a door. If no 
passwords are used to protect your user account, anyone could use your Macin-
tosh and open any door. With a password, which is like a key, the door to your 
Macintosh is locked until the key is used to open it.
Figure 54-1: You can password protect your screensaver and sleep 
mode in the Security & Privacy window.

Chapter 54
When you create multiple accounts on your Macintosh, you essentially cre-
ate multiple doors to your Macintosh, and each door (account) can be locked with 
a different key (password). Each time you turn on your computer, your Macintosh 
automatically accesses one account without requiring you to type a password. 
(Accessing an account is known as logging in. Exiting out of an account is known 
as logging out.)
The problem with this automatic login feature, however, is that anyone can 
turn your Macintosh on to access an account on your computer. Therefore, the 
first step in password protecting your Macintosh is to turn off the automatic login 
feature so that only people with a password can gain access. Here’s how to turn off 
automatic login and define an automatic logout inactivity time:
1.	
Click the Apple menu and choose System Preferences. The System Prefer-

Choosing and Changing Your Passwords
You should choose a password that’s not easy for anyone to guess. For example, 
your first name, street address, 123, or simply PASSWORD are all bad passwords.
To create a password that’s difficult to guess, use a mix of uppercase and 
lowercase letters with symbols and numbers, such as Dj8$eR2Lp. If you need help 
creating a good password, use a random password generator such as the one 
available at http://www.pctools.com/guides/password/. When you create a pass-
word of random characters, the odds of someone guessing the password are very 
low (but the odds of you forgetting your own password are much higher).
Here’s how to change your password:
1.	
Click the Apple menu and choose System Preferences. The System Prefer-
ences window appears.
2.	
Click the Users & Groups icon under the System category. The Users & 
Groups window appears.

Additional Ideas for Password Protecting 
Your Macintosh
Passwords won’t keep out a determined intruder, but they will keep out the casual 
snooping of a family member or co-worker. If you’d be in big trouble if someone 
read the data on your laptop after you forgot it in a coffee shop (or if you just want 
to be safe!), try encrypting the hard disk (see Chapter 55).
Figure 54-2: To change your password, 
you must first type your old password and 
then type a new password.

You might think the safest way to protect your 
data is to hide your computer behind armed 
guards and keep it under lock-and-key. But 
there is an easier way: encryption.
Encryption scrambles your data and 
­password-protects it—to read the data, you 
must type the correct password. As long as 
you’re the only one who knows your pass-
word, you’ll be the only person who can read 
encrypted files.

Data and Guarding 
Your Privacy

Q
Q Note: If you encrypt data with a password and forget that password, you’ll 
never be able to read that data ever again. If you encrypt data with a simple 
password that’s easy to guess (such as 123 or PASSWORD), an intruder could 
guess your password and access your data. Your data is only as safe as your 
password.
Besides using encryption, you may also want to turn off or regulate location 
services, which can use your computer’s Wi-Fi to give away your location. Normally 
location services can be helpful, such as for a weather app that can show you the 
weather forecast for your current location. However, if you’re trying to hide from 
someone, you may not want location services to give your position away.
Project goal: Learn to encrypt the data on your Macintosh and monitor loca-
tion services.
What You’ll Be Using
To encrypt data and monitor location services, you’ll use the following:
>
>
The System Preferences program
>
>
The FileVault program
Encrypting Your Hard Disk
Turning on the FileVault program encrypts the information in your entire hard 
disk using the password you use for your account. For safety, you can also create 
a recovery key to access your encrypted hard disk. That way, if you forget your 
account password, you can still read your files using the recovery key. If you forget 
both your account password and your recovery key, you can never read your data 
again.
Q
Q Note: FileVault uses an encryption algorithm called Advanced Encryption 
Standard (AES), which even government agencies can’t crack (theoretically).
To encrypt your hard disk using FileVault, do this:
1.	
Click the Apple menu and select System Preferences. A System Prefer-
ences window appears.
2.	
Click the Security & Privacy icon under the Personal category. The Security & 
Privacy window appears.
3.	
Click the FileVault tab, as shown in Figure 55-1.
4.	
Click the Turn On FileVault button. If you have set up multiple accounts, a 
dialog appears, letting you choose which accounts can access the computer, 
as shown in Figure 55-2. If an account is not enabled, the account cannot 
access the computer until someone else unlocks the hard disk first. When 
you have enabled the accounts that should have access to the encrypted 
hard disk, click Continue.

forget your password, as shown in Figure 55-3.
Q
Q Note: If a thief finds this recovery key, he (or she) can recover data encrypted 
on your hard disk as well.
6.	
Click Continue. Another dialog appears, giving you the option of storing your 
recovery key with Apple or not, as shown in Figure 55-4. If you choose to store 
your recovery key with Apple, you’ll need to provide them with answers to 
three questions. Make sure you know these answers or else Apple won’t give 
you your own recovery key.
7.	
Click Continue. A dialog appears, letting you know that the encryption pro-
cess will start as soon as you click the Restart button. 
Complete encryption can take a few hours, but you’ll be able to use your 
Macintosh in the meantime. To access an encrypted hard disk, you’ll need your 
account login password or the recovery key.

Turning Off Location Services
By modifying the location service preferences of individual programs with loca-
tion service options for Mac OS X, you can allow certain programs to use location 
services while blocking others from doing so. To turn location services on or off, 
do this: 
1.	
Click the Apple menu and select System Preferences. A System Prefer-
ences window appears.
2.	
Click the Security & Privacy icon under the Personal category. The Security & 
Privacy window appears.
3.

4.	
Select or clear the Enable Location Services checkbox. 
5.	
Click the close button of the Security & Privacy window. 
Additional Ideas for Encrypting Your Data
If you use a laptop Macintosh, encrypting your data can protect it in case some­
one steals your computer. With encryption turned on, a thief won’t be able to read 
any files stored in your Home folder. If you use a desktop Macintosh, it’s less likely 
Figure 55-5: The Privacy tab lets you turn location services on or off.

Chapter 55
that someone will steal your computer, so encryption is more useful for protecting 
against others peeking at your files, such as your supervisor, co-workers, or even 
family members.
By itself, encryption can protect your data, but if your data is truly important, 
consider storing it on a removable device, such as an external hard disk or USB 
flash drive that you can disconnect and take with you. By storing crucial data off 
your hard disk and encrypting that data, you won’t have to worry about anyone 
accessing your Macintosh without your knowledge. (Then you’ll just have to worry 
about losing your external hard drive or USB flash drive.)

56
In the old days if someone wanted to sneak into 
your computer, they would have to physically 
break into your home or office and use your 
computer without your knowledge. Stopping 
these types of intruders was as easy as locking 
your Macintosh in a sealed room. 
However, the latest danger is that someone 
can access your computer remotely through 
the Internet. You could even be using your com-
puter and not know that someone else is quietly 
sneaking into your Macintosh and stealing data 
right in front of you. 
Configuring 
the Firewall

454	 |	
Chapter 56
To stop intruders from accessing your ­computer through the Internet, you 
need to use a program called a firewall. The main idea behind a firewall is that it 
blocks suspicious or invalid data while letting in the data that you need or want.
Think of a firewall as an intelligent doorman who tries his best to open the door 
to your Macintosh only to authorized data and slam it shut against malicious data.
Project goal: Learn how to protect your Macintosh with a firewall.
What You’ll Be Using
To learn how to use the built-in Macintosh firewall, you’ll be using:
>
>
The System Preferences program
Turning the Firewall On (or Off)
If you plan on connecting your Macintosh to the Internet, or even to a local area 
network, you need a firewall. Just as you would never leave your car door unlocked 
in a dangerous neighborhood, you should never leave your Macintosh unprotected 
when it’s connected to the Internet.
The only time you might want to turn off your firewall is to install a different 
firewall instead. Computers only need one firewall. If you try to run two or more 
firewalls, each firewall will interfere with the other one. So the lesson is simple. 
Always have a firewall and only use one firewall at a time. For most people, the 
one firewall they’ll use is the built-in firewall that comes with every Macintosh.
To turn the built-in firewall on or off, do this:
1.	
Click the Apple menu and choose System Preferences. The System Prefer-
ences window appears.
2.	
Click the Security & Privacy icon under the Personal category. The Security & 
Privacy window appears.
3.	
Click the Firewall tab, as shown in Figure 56-1.
4.	
Click the lock icon in the bottom-left corner of the Security & Privacy win-
dow. The lock must be open for you to make changes. (Skip this step if the 
lock icon already appears as an open lock.) When a dialog appears, type 
your password and click OK.
5.	
Click the Start button to turn the firewall on. (If you only see a Stop button, 
that means your firewall is already turned on. If you click the Stop button, 
you will turn the firewall off.) 

	
Configuring the Firewall	
|	 455
Configuring the Firewall
When you turn the firewall on, it does its best to block suspicious data trying to get 
into your Macintosh. However, you might want to take some time to customize the 
firewall. Three options for strengthening your firewall include:
>
>
Block all incoming connections  This option blocks all connections except 
those basic services required to use the Internet. This provides greater protec-
tion, but at the possible expense of preventing your Macintosh from doing 
certain things on the Internet, such as video conferencing.
>
>
Automatically allow signed software to receive incoming connections 
This provides greater protection, but at the expense of blocking legitimate 
software if it doesn’t contain a certificate.
>
>
Enable stealth mode  This helps make your Macintosh invisible over the 
Internet so hackers can’t find your computer, let alone break into it. Of course, 
if you need another computer to find and recognize your Macintosh over the 
Internet, you might not want to enable stealth mode—it can prevent legiti-
mate computers from accessing your Macintosh.
Figure 56-1: The Firewall tab lets you turn your firewall on (or off) and 
offers options for configuring your firewall.

Chapter 56
To configure your firewall, do this:
1.	
Click the Apple menu and choose System Preferences. The System Prefer-
ences window appears.
2.	
Click the Security & Privacy icon under the Personal category. The Secu-
rity & Privacy window appears.
3.	
Click the Firewall tab (see Figure 56-1).
4.	
Click the lock icon in the bottom-left corner of the Security & Privacy win-
dow. The lock must be open for you to make changes. (Skip this step if the 
lock icon already appears as an open lock.) When a dialog appears, type 
your password and click OK.
5.	
Click the Advanced button in the lower-right corner of the Security & Privacy 
window. Another dialog appears, as shown in Figure 56-2. (If the Advanced 
button appears dimmed, that means you haven’t turned your firewall on yet.)
6.	
(Optional) Select (or clear) the Block all incoming connections checkbox.
7.	
(Optional) Click the plus button to display a list of programs installed on 
your Macintosh. Then click a program name that you want the firewall to 
let through. This displays a list of available programs with a pop-up menu. 
Click a program and click the Add button. Then choose Allow incoming 
connections or Block incoming connections, as shown in Figure 56-3.
8.	
(Optional) Select (or clear) the Automatically allow signed software to 
receive incoming connections checkbox. Any programs (even legitimate 
ones) that don’t have a signed certificate won’t be able to access the Internet 
from your Macintosh.

Additional Ideas for Using the Firewall
If you use the Internet, make sure you’ve turned on your firewall. For greater secu-
rity, enable stealth mode, which essentially makes your Macintosh invisible over the 
Internet. The idea behind stealth mode is that hackers can’t attack your computer 
if they can’t find it.
The other configuration features of the firewall can provide greater security 
by blocking every program from accessing the Internet except for the handful that 
you approve. By blocking access to the Internet, the firewall can keep spyware 
programs from stealing your password or credit card data and sending it across 
the Internet to a malicious hacker. 
A firewall by itself can’t guarantee your computer’s protection, but it can 
keep your Macintosh safe from unskilled hackers (often called newbies) and the 
growing, but so far unrealized, threat of spyware on the Macintosh.
The Macintosh may not suffer as many virus and worm outbreaks as other 
types of operating systems, but that doesn’t mean it will stay this way forever. The 
more people there are using a Macintosh, the more tempting a target the Macin-
tosh will become for malicious hackers.
Figure 56-3: You can selectively determine which programs 
can connect to the Internet.

458	 |	
Chapter 56
For maximum protection, download software only from reputable sites (such 
as from the Mac App Store), never accept file attachments from unknown people, 
and always back up your data to make sure it’s safe, just in case something does 
manage to get on your computer and wipe everything out. A firewall is your first 
line of defense, but a little bit of common sense and caution will ensure that your 
Macintosh stays safe and secure. 

This book can’t teach you everything there is 
to know about your Macintosh. Instead, it can 
give you a solid foundation on which you can 
learn to use your Macintosh to do actual work. 
After you get comfortable using your Mac­intosh 
on a regular basis, then you can graduate to 
other books and learn about more advanced 
features.
Then again, you don’t have to learn every-
thing about your Macintosh, because the point 
of getting a Macintosh is that it helps you get 
your work done as simply and easily as pos-
sible. Once you’ve accomplished that, learning 
anything more about your Macintosh may be 
nice, but it is ultimately irrelevant. You want to 
spend your time constructively. 
The Next 
Step

460	 |	
The Next Step
Your Macintosh is truly a personal computer because it’s flexible enough 
to meet the needs of rocket scientists and housewives, microbiologists and 
plumbers, accountants and students, and practically everyone in between. You 
may never use the features that a computer scientist might need, but your Macin-
tosh will always have those features if you ever need them. 
Think of this book as training wheels that give you a gentle push in the right 
direction—now it’s time for you to take off on your own. Don’t be afraid of making 
mistakes. (Remember, you can often undo your last command/mistake by press-
ing the -Z keystroke combination.) What makes the Macintosh different from any 
other computer is that learning how to use it can actually be fun. 
Your Macintosh is only a tool. Just as you don’t have to learn automotive 
engineering to drive a car, you shouldn’t feel compelled to become a computer 
expert just to use your Macintosh. As long as you’re having fun and being produc-
tive in your life, it doesn’t really matter how much or how little you know about 
computers, anyway. All you really need is something that will help you reach 
your goals, and for most people, that something will always be their Macintosh 
computer.
