Set against a topical background o f

his captive mentor, Colonel Sam
Troutman.
Starting with Rambo's search for
the enemy fort where the Colonel is
imprisoned, he must then don his

T
he new Copyright Bill has been
I .  approved without the inclusion of
the blank tape levy. Th e  larger
recording companies have been trying
to apply pressure for the inclusion of
the levy in an attempt to recoup some
of the lost revenue caused by home
recording of copyright material such
as music and video. Despite strong
counter appeals from a pressure group,
the Home Taping Rights Campaign,
the levy has kept looming around the
Bill at all stages of its passage through
Parliament.
The problem which led t o  the
omission of the tax lies in the fact that
not a l l  tape recording involves
copyright material. Organisations such
as the Hospital Broadcasting Service
and those producing tapes fo r the
visually handicapped were threatened
with additional ﬁnancial hardships.
Although the prospect of increased
revenue appealed to  the recording
Rambo Returns
escaping from the fort with the Colonel
and breaking for the border in an
enemy tank.
Featuring the massive armoury
which Rambo ususally carries around,
the game also extensively uses 3 D
graphics and high-energy action.
Rambo 111 costs 19.95 (cass) and
E14.94 (disk) for the C64, and E24.95
for the Amiga.

industry, the software sector was less
welcoming. Before the exclusion of the
levy, it looked as though there would
be no provision for software houses
within the Bill, and this was just one
of many reasons for the levy's demise.
The H o m e  Ta p i n g  R i g h ts
Campaign has been battling against
the proposed tax since July 1986, just
three months after it was proposed in
the White Paper o n  Intellectual
Property and Innovation.
On hearing th e  good news,
Campaign Director, David Hall,
stated, "The British Government has
taken the lead i n  protecting the
consumer and set a  lead fo r other
European countries t o  follow i n
rejecting this unjust tax."

explains how the scheme will operate.
"We have a large supply o f surplus
software from the last ﬁve years, and
we want to put it to good use. Anyone
who writes i n  t o  u s enclosing a
donation to Barnardo's will receive a
p ro gram "
The good news is that the software
is pricipally for the C64, but donors
should state which computer they own,
with their name and address. Just in
case supplies run out, Supersoft would
also like to know i f you want your
money back should there be n o
software to send. Please also enclose
42p worth of stamps to cover postage
and packing.
All cheques and Postal Orders
should be payable to Barnardo's and
sent to:
Barnardo's Offer, Winchester House,
Canning Road, Wealdstone, Harrow
HA3 7S0.
Barnardo's stress that they are no
longer me re l y concerned w i t h
providing 'homes' for orphans but are
now involved wherever there are
young people in trouble or children
with handicaps. Funds are always
essential to the organisation and David
Batterbury, Director o f the London
and East Anglia Region of Barnardo's
says, "We're very grateful to Supersoft.
We hope that people will take up this
offer and be as generous i n  their
donations as Supersoft have already
been."

New Online Service
C
ommodore PC users amongst our
readers who are considering trying
out comms, may be interested to know
there is a new UK based on-line service
in operation.
Called the Direct Connection, it's
a subscription-only service which
caters for PC users. The software used
to run the system has been developed
in-house, and i s extremely user-
friendly. Subscribers can tailor the
system to  their needs by 'switching'
various options such as menus,
continous scrolling, default ﬁl e
transfer protocol and so on.
Direct Connection is multi-user,
and features a number of conferences.
These can be compared with the more
conventional 'topics' found on most
BBs. However, with conferencing soft-
ware, the commands to read, scan,
search and send items are far more
comprehensive.
_Other features include a daily news
bulletin (US origin), and an overnight
fax service (text only). To get a better
idea of what's available, you can log-
on to the Direct Connection with a
demo account. Simply dial 01-853
3965 (data), and enter demo at the
prompt.

criminals. Schwarzenneger's charac-
ter, Ben Richards, is a fallen law en-
forcer who refused to open ﬁre on a
group of unarmed demonstrators, and
his punishment is to be meted out in
the horriﬁc dungeons and caves before
the eyes of viewing millions.
The caves a re  inhabited b y'
murderous terminators who revel in
names such as Fireball, Dynamo,
Buzzsaw and Subzero. The aim is to
avoid the sting of their stunning array
of weapons and escape, despite the
shrieks for blood from the audience.

pany that operates the MicroLink
service on Telecom Gold, is consid-
ering supporting Amiga telesoftware
as part of its service.
Telesoftware o n  Mi cro Link i s
normally provided by the magazines
that Database publish, but one factor
that might prevent the introduction of
Amiga Software is the time it takes
to download, according to a spokes-
man, as Database Amiga ﬁles tend to
be on the large size, even when ARCed.
This would mean that the time taken
hild re n in Need could beneﬁt from
a charitable bet between Cascade
Games and bookmakers, William Hill.
The gamble centres around Cascade's
horse racing predictor, Form Master,
for which William Hill's have offered
E50 worth of free bets, the proceeds
to go to the Charity.
The challenge commenced last
November when the ﬁrst bet was laid
by Nigel Stevens, Managing Director
of Cascade, and the horse, Beau
Ranger, romped home to win the 2pm
at Haydock. Commenting o n  this
initial success, Grahame Sharpe o f
William Hill's stated, "First blood to

Amiga Software on MicroLink?
to download an Amiga item would be
quite considerable. However, since PC
software (which is also quite large) is
supported, this would negate that
argument somewhat.
Existing MicroLink subscribers
who would like to see the introduction
of Amiga telesoftware on the system
should m a i l b o x  Database o n

Cascade is obviously extremely
pleased with its success and takes a more
optimistic view. A s  Nigel Stevens

CBM's Business Machines
vollowing on from the success o f
its lower-priced PC1 computer,
Commodore has further underlined its
commitment to the PC market with
the production of a modiﬁed version
of its existing range. The new machine
is simply the PC60/40 with a single
drive instead of the 40Mb hard disk.
The new PC60 SD  also allows
ﬂexibility i f the customer wishes to
upgrade by allowing the connection of
proprietary hard disks or hard cards
to suit individual needs and budgets.
The substitution o f  the new drive
effectively reduces the cost o f  the
system by at least f 1600.
The PC60 SD with monochrome
display costs 0399, 0549 with colour
display, and the enhanced colour
display version retails for E2699.

FT on Gold
F r  he Xmodem ﬁle transfer protocol
is about to  be implemented on
Telecom Gold, and it looks as if Micro-
Link subscribers will be amongst the
ﬁrst to make use of it.
The Xmodem ﬁle transfer protocol
is by far the most widely used method
of error correction amongst computers
today. Up to now there has been no
error-corrected method of transfering
ﬁles to/ from Telecom Gold, with the
exception o f MicroLink users, who
have access to  the Kermit FTP on
request.
Telecom Gold has been experimen-
ting with Xmodem (aka FT) for some
time, and it's understood tests have
been completed and the facility will
be made available any day now.
However, as Xmodem is an 8-bit
ﬁle transfer protocol, people wishing
to use the facility will have to connect
to Telecom Gold vi a  the Packet
Switched Stream (PSS), as this is also
8-bit, whereas the T G  direct dial
numbers are only 7-bit.
Besides the obvious advantage of
being able to send error-free text to
and fro m the system, binary ﬁle
transfer will also be possible. Binary
ﬁles (programs etc) that are sent to
Telecom Go l d  are automatically
converted to expanded hex, and can
be mailed to another subscriber like
any other mail item. When down-
loading, the reverse happens and the
expanded hex ﬁle is translated back
into binary form.
Supra Modem
T
he Commodore Computer Show
held a t the Novotel, Hammer-
smith, in November was quite sparse
on the comms front. Even Y2 Comp-
uting, who are regular exhibitors at
the show, didn't make an appearance.
However, one item that caught my eye
was the SupraModem 24000, which is
being sold by Frontier Software.
At E199.95, the modem operates at
three speeds -  300/300 (V2I), 1200/
1200 (V22) and 2400/ 2400 (V22bis) at
European C C ITT standards. This
Hayes-compatible m o d e m  a l s o
features auto-answer/dial (tone o r
pulse) and a speaker, which is used
to monitor the status of the line.
A free CompuServe (US on-line
database) starter kit is also thrown in.

and magic of a role-playing game, yet will be played
and enjoyed by the masses of arcade game players.
Times o f Lore is the latest attempt by those adventurers
at Origins who created the Ultima series of games (see Ultima
V in this issue) and is also the company's ﬁrst cassette-
based game.
The game covers the times when chaos ruled the land
of Albareth. The High King, drained and weary in battle,
hides in the Elden routes to recuperate, leaving the land
in the control of his steward Dariel, who is weak and unable
to stop the many squabbles for power. To make things
worse, ores begin invading from the north. You play a brave
young adventurer, and cast your role by selecting from three
heroes during an illustrated opening sequence. You can be
a knight in protective armour, a barbarian who can deliver
a mighty blow, or a valkerie whose abilities are halfway
in between.
You begin your destiny in an inn in the town of Eralan,
but are soon put to task by a strange woman known as
the Prior, who sends you to ﬁnd the magical foretelling
stones -  just one of the three magical items used by the
old High King to maintain order in the land. This ﬁrst
quest takes you into the forest to the North and into battle
with rogues, skeletons, and ores, who hold the stones in
their camp deep in the woods. Should you complete this
task, many others lie in wait in this troubled land.
Although the top-down view o f the main display will
remind you of games such as Gauntlet and Dandy, this
is nothing like them, and if you adopt that slay-everything
style o f play, your games will end quickly. Instead, you
should play it like a role-playing game, noting down clues,
carrying out quests, asking friends for information and
battling bravely with foes.
Below the main display, a  scroll-like text window
displays the messages from the other characters in the game,
and below that are a series of icons activated by pressing
the space bar and selected with the joystick. Through these
icons you can talk to the serfs, guards and barons, examine

objects, cast a spell from a scroll, drink a potion, load a
saved game or pause the game to offer an object to another
character.
Despite the fact that you can do all those things, you
don't have to type in a single word as everything is joystick
controlled. When you talk to a game character - usually
an innkeeper as they have more to say - you can inquire
about rumours in general or speciﬁc objects, people or
mysterious happenings. Fo r example, i f  you asked an
innkeeper i f he'd heard any rumours, he might say that
there have been strange noises as a subject to ask about.
Ask again and the innkeeper may give information
containing more of these keywords, say he knows nothing,
or tell you of someone who may know more. It's then up
to you to decide which leads to follow.
Sooner, rather than later, this will lead you into combat
with a monster, which is decided with simple joystick presses.
Against most monsters, two or three hits should do the
job h o w e ve r, some may take more. They're usually
unarmed, but you may ﬁnd some have weapons, such as
a throwing dagger or a bow. Your strength is depicted as
a candle, which burns down as you move, and when you're
hit in combat, but it can be replenished by sleeping it off
in an inn, or drinking a magic potion that you ﬁnd on
a defeated foe_
I've been playing Times of Lore for several hours now,
so it's just as well that you can save the game (by sleeping
in an inn), as there are between 200-300 hours exploring
left to go. I have now travelled the length of the land, and
have a stack o f rumours to chase and quests to  fulﬁl.
Apparently there are 13,000 different screen locations to
explore, so really I've only just scratched the surface, but
I'm hooked already. Time will tell how many arcade garners
are enticed by the game, but it's sure to appeal to role-
players like myself.

Can Datel turn your study into a studio?

computers can be exceptionally
useful. Music is one o f those
things, particularly when delving into
the world of M
based sequencer packages are a stand-
ard feature i n  most professional
studios and are responsible for much
of what we hear in the charts.
Date! Electronics have taken this
theory one stage further by attempting
to replace two pieces of hi-tech music
hardware with disk-based equivalents,
namely the drum machine and the
sampler. So  can the humble C64
replace Linn Drums and Fairlights?
Well, sort of.
Sound Sampler - linear display
Datel's Digital Sound Sampler
comes as a hardware unit, which plugs
into the user port, and a disk or tape
containing all the utilities required to
drive it.
The hardware unit has four points
of interest on the back. Firstly, there
are the two input sockets. No, the unit
isn't stereo, one is a microphone socket
and the other is a line input. The next
socket is a  line output suitable for
hooking up to a hi-ﬁ ampliﬁer or a
tape deck. Alternatively, you can use
HARDWARE REVIEWS
couild Sampler - 3D display
the lead provided to connect the line
output of the sampler to the audio'
video socket of the C64. In this way
you can hear the sound of the sampler
through your TV. Users of monitors
will need a jack-to-phono lead to do
the same trick. This is stressed as a
practice measure in the manual and
they advise hookup to an amp for the
best results. All three sockets are for
standard jack plugs, which is a com-
mon enough practice i n  musical
circles.
The ﬁnal rear-mounted facility is
a rotary control knob which is used
to vary echo feedback which I shall
explain later.
On loading up the software, the
screen displays a set of menu options
in a basic but adequate manner. First
you'll need the set-up menu which
allows you to select the sample fre-
quency, the amount of echo you want
to add (if any), the recording trigger
level and MID I switch which allows
you to  trigger the sampler from a
MIDI instrument with the aid o f the
Datel MIDI interface which plugs into
the cartridge port.
Date! obviously don't like to own
up to  what the sample frequencies
actually are because they are speciﬁed
by values between one and eight (one
giving you one second of sample time,
eight giving you nearly three seconds
worth). Th e  actual sampler audio
bandwidth seems to be around 10Khz
which is about the same as cheap audio
tape. There is also an awful lot o f
background noise even when I hooked
the unit up to a decent amp and used
studio quality headphones. Not terri-
bly impressive but you can't really
expect too much from a E50 piece of
hardware.
Sound Sampler - Keyboard
On the plus side you can reverse
and edit samples once they are stored
in memory and the overdub facility
allows you to overlay one sample on
another. Furthermore, you can use the
sampler as a basic real-time echo unit
which is fun but, again, not really
usable for actual musical applications.
In short, this is a nice toy and a
good introduction to  the world o f
sampling but serious computer musi-
cians should forget this as a  cheap
alternative to  a  proper piece o f
dedicated hardware.

Corn-Drum - Composing screen
Hit that perfect beat
Using similar technology, b u t t o
different effect, there's Datel's Corn-
Drum which, as the title suggests, is
a desk-top beatbox. Once again we
have a combination o f disk or tape
software with a plug-in unit that looks
almost identical to the Datel sampler.
Not so many ins and outs on this one
though, just a line level output and
a trigger output which allows a crude
form of interfacing with proper drum
machines o r  older CV/Gate style
synths such as the Roland S14-101.
In its favour, Corn-Drum allows
you to load in and save drum patterns
and drum sounds, so a comprehensive
library o f different kits can be col-
lected. Presumably Datel will spot the
potential market for 'best o f' drum
machine disks.
Of course, you're not just limited
to straight drum sounds. If you have
the sampler as well (which seems to
be expected of you as both products
share one owners' manual) you can
port samples across. Yo u r drum
patterns could contain vocal snatches,
orchestral stabs, excited donkeys,
anything. In fact the combination of
HARDWARE REVIEWS
both products could be marketed as
the Hip-Hop Construction Set (no
charge for the idea fellas!).
All well and good so far but here's
where a  few snags crop up. Mo st
importantly, the sound quality was not
too hot, although some sounds were
better than others, so it could be that
Corn-Drum is best used for a limited
range of sounds. It could also just be
down to personal taste, I suppose,
There was also the problem o f
background noise which, although
tolerable when fed through the TV,
became very annoying when p u t

through my studio amp. The only way
around this would be to buy some form
of noise gate which cuts the sound
when the signal drops below a certain
level. A  cheap foot pedal model will
cost between £30 and £60.
Programming Corn-Drum couldn't
be simpler. You have the option of real-
time or step-time recording. I found the best
way to enter patterns was to record in real-
time and correct errors and add ﬁddly bits
in step-time.
Although you can have up to eight
sounds to a kit, you can only have three
of them playing on the same beat,
which could actually be quite a serious
limitation because even the most basic
of disco drum patterns will have a t
least a bass drum, snare and hi-hat on
the same beat which means that any
tom ﬁll that goes over those particular
beats will be lost.
Once you're happy with a  few
patterns, you can arrange the patterns
into songs. It's possible to arrange a
standard pop song using ﬁve patterns;
intro, verse, chorus, middle eight and
outro. These can be used once o r
looped a number of time,s whichever
is required.
As with the sampler, Datel seem
to hate using standards which give
anything away. With Corn-Drum the
tempo is not measured in BPM (Beats
Per Minute) but in some nondescript
set of numbers. The equivalent of 120
BPM seems to lie somewhere in the
early 200s.
To me, this is also a nice toy but
will no doubt lose its appeal if the user
starts to take music more seriously.
Having said that, the combination of
the sampler hardware/ software and
the Corn-Drum software (which Datel
will sell separately) may well do a lot
of good introducing newcomers to the
world of music.

Blip — Video Collection
H
remember t h e  o l d
black-and-white pong games
that were available for TVs
a number of year ago? Well
if you can remember that far
back (I can E d ) ,  you'll no
doubt r e m e m b e r  t h e
extremely crude graphics
and very poor sound that
accompanied what was a
very popular game.
You may think that this
type of game is a thing of
the past -  but Silverbird
have other ideas: they've
just unleashed the horrors of
pong on a n  unsuspecting
budget-buying public.
Blip offers the games
player a chance to try their
hand a t any one o f  six
games, each one of them a
variation on pong. Some of
the games will be familiar to
those w h o se  memories
expand as far back at the
pong consoles, others will be
totally new. Fong is the
original game. With one bat
on either side of the screen,
the idea is to knock the ball
at your opponent and hope
that they miss it, giving you
the points.
Colour and sound have
been added to this and all
other games in the collec-
tion, and the addition of a
one player-vs-computer-
option widens the appeal.
Football gives each player
control over two bats. One
bat moves up and down the
edge o f the screen as with
pong, while the other one
has the added ability o f
being able to  move across
the screen as far as what
would be the centre line.
In Squash sees, both bats
are on one side of the screen,
the idea being to bounce the
ball off of any of the three
on-screen walls, and hope
that your opponent misses it
as i t  moves towards the
screen edge. Solo Squash is
practically the same but,
with only one bat - more of
a practice mode than a game.
Four Bat Blip was a
totally new one on me. One
player has control of bats at
the left and top of the screen,
the other has bats at the right
and bottom. The idea of the
game is to prevent the ball
from going off of any screen
area that your bats protect.
This is probably the hardest
game to master.
The ﬁnal game i n  the
G A M E S  U P D A T E
collection is Asterbliperolds.
Despite it's fancy name, this
is just another version o f
pong, with a  number o f
objects, asteroids, moving
up and down the centre o f
the screen. If the ball hits one
of these objects then it could
bounce o ff at any angle -
even back to the person who
had just hit it.
I must admit that of all
the games that I  had the
chance to look at for this
issue, this is the one that I
enjoyed the most. Perhaps
this is due to a little bit of
nostalgia, b u t i t  i s more
likely due to the fact that
pong and its variations are
great fun to play.

GAMES U P D A T E
Fast Break
I es the Jammers against
the Slammers, and it's the
fourth quarter. Yo u 've
already lost your star for-
ward through six personal
fouls - it's been that type of
game. Now you've got to call
the plays to break down the
defence and score some
baskets, as you're still trail-
ing 68-75.
There have been basket-
ball games before, but only
this one from Accolade (via
Electronic Arts) combines
the arcade action w i th
coaching decisions - timing
substitutions, calling offen-
sive and defensive set plays,
and so on. It even includes
an option to devise your own
special play.
The action is played in
3D on a  screen that ﬂips
from one end o f the court
to the other, between two
teams of three (with a squad
of six to pick from). As in
most of these arcade sports
games, you play one of the
players, but can swap con-
trol to another by pressing
the joystick button, which is
also the means of passing the
ball. Holding the button and
then releasing i t gives you
a jump and shoot move.
In defence, you must try
to steal the ball without
charging o r  fouling your
opponent -  you can also
intercept passes and jump to
block a shot. However, this
game goes further than just
arcade playing, as you can
call offensive and defensive
plays to try and outsmart a
team. These set out deﬁned
running and passing patt-
erns for your team to follow,
but you can can deﬁne your
own by plotting four posi-
tions for each of your three
players. Just call it when you
have the ball at the halfway
line, and then see how well
it works. I f  it goes wrong,
you can always call a time-
out to plan another.
Each player is rated for
his speed, inside and outside
shooting, passing and ball
handling skills, and they're
all paired o ff into alterna-
tives for the centre, guard
and forward position. It's up
to you to plan the strategy
and carry it out.
It's a shame that there are
only two teams included on
the disk, as either will give
the novice player a pounding
that might just put him off
the game for good -  you
have to practise to stand any
chance at all. Perhaps Acco-
lade are planning a  team
construction disk, a feature
just released fo r  4th and
Inches through which you
can build up your own team.
Overall, Fast Break is one of
the best basketball games
you can get, but there's still
room for improvement.

By Fair Means or Foul?
I  t's a  puzzle as to  how
Barry McGuigan got him-
self involved i n  the pre-
launch publicity fo r  this
boxing simulation. As the
title suggests, By Fair Means
or Foul is not entirely played
by Marquis of Queensberry
rules. Y o u  w oul d  have
thought that Baz, who is not
particularly noted for dirty
play, might have shyed clear
of such a slur on his pro-
fessional reputation. Large
cheques can, o f  course,
account for a lot.
Be th i s  a s  i t  m a y ,
BFMOF may provide some
diversion for lovers of con-
tact s p o r t simulations.
Besides the usual fair moves:
head punch; body blow;
upper cut; and duck punch,
there is a range of four foul
moves: head butt; kneeing;
kicking, and the indispensa-
ble groin punch. Of course,
the latter moves cannot be
used i f  the ref is looking,
under pain o f disqualiﬁca-
tion -  but the moment his
back's turned...
Superior has a t least
tried to introduce an element
of variety into this often stale
genre. I  think that fans o f
fair boxing may, however,
ﬁnd it a little below the belt.

Footballer of the Year
T
his is like a mixture of
an Epyx-style Games
simulation mated with Foot-
ball Manager. The start of
the game sees you, at the age
of 17, as an aspiring young
player with just 000 to your
name. The object o f  the
game, of course is to climb
the ladder t o  fame and
fortune.
Much of the game con-
sists o f  ﬁnancial transac-
tions. You may, for exam-
ple, buy cards which will be
of l a te r  advantage_ A
transfer card may give you
the chance to transfer to a
more prestigious team, while
goal cards give you a  lot
more chance, in the playing
sequence, o f scoring goals.
Incident cards, which cost
£200 each, are random,
something beneﬁcial may
happen, but it's a bit of a
risk.
The arcade sequence pits
you against a defended goal,
and it's basically an archery
shoot. Your goal cards may
help you out here.
Footballer of the Year is
a very lightweight game and
may appeal to younger game
players, T h e r e  w a s n ' t

interest for long.

Gary Lineker's Superskills
I  t certainly seems to be the
season for football-based
games, although software
houses are as usual faced
with the fundamental fact
that computers are better
adapted to single-player use,
so football in its full glory
is a tad difﬁcult to convert
convincingly. Gremlin's way
of getting around this chest-
nut is to stress the training
aspect.
Superskills puts you through
a demanding and exhausting
series o f  g y m  a n d
ﬁeld trials and rates you
accordingly. In the gym, you
are asked to perform push-
ups (hardly the most exciting
of competitive activities, I
would have thought), squat
thrusts (yawn!). weight
training (picking up a bit)
and a work-out on the paral-
lel bars (so-so).
Things get a little more
exciting in the ﬁeld, which
requires you to do a fair bit
of slalom work (dribbling,
chipping and shooting) and
also tests your ability to take
penalties.
At the end of all this, you
get the chance to try for a
real g o a l . Sh o u l d  y o u
achieve this, you can have a
go at kicking a ball through
the middle of an old tyre. A
gusting wind may make this
harder than it sounds.
If you're a  soccer fan,
you may enjoy this.

Supersports — The
Alternative
Olympics
r i k a y ,  so we've all had
I L /  more th a n  o u r  fa i r
share of Track & Field type
games, particularly during
the summer months of last
year. Now it would seem that
Gremlin has decided to use
a similar format but with
different sports.
Supersports consists o f
ﬁve events which can be
attempted individually or as
a set. First o f the ﬁve is
'Crack Shot'which is a shoot-
ing gallery set in an alley.
Various points are awarded
for static o r  moving o r
thrown targets and points
are deducted fo r shooting
alley cats.
Next we have the 'Dare
Devil Dive'. Here you can
select your desired height
(40400 feet) and dive into
a small area of water doing
as many tricks as you can
to obtain style points while
keeping your shadow over
the water f o r  accuracy
points.
Thirdly we ﬁnd ourselves
amid a 'Slate Smashing' con-
test. You have one minute
to kick and punch your way
through as many slates as
possible. Mi n d  expanding
stuff!
Then there's 'Cross Bow'
which, as the name suggests
is yet more target practice
for budding cider drinkers.
And ﬁnally we have the
grand 'Underwater Assuale
Course. Yes that's right, the
Krypton F a c t o r  w i t h
ﬂippers.
All i n  a l l  n o t a  bad
selection of sport, but d o
feel that the novelty will
wear off quite quickly.

et another Ikari War-
Hors' Commando clone
emerges. This one is from
software stalwarts Imagine.
And once again a software
house can truthfully say that
this i s n o t a  rip-off but
ofﬁcially licensed from an
arcade coin-op, this time
from a  relative unknown
manufacturer S N K  (Shin
Nihon Kikaku) Corp.
Nothing particularly uni-
que i n  this version apart
from the fact that you can
rotate your trooper's body
left and right while still
moving forward. This i s
achieved by using the X and
V keys on the keyboard or
by investing in a Cheetah 125
Joystick, although person-
ally I  wouldn't buy one
purely on the strength of this
game.
It certainly isn't the best
version around, thanks lar-
gely to the Spectrumesque
graphics and the sluggish
gameplay.

C64 PROGRAM
Tape Menu
Want to know where your cassette are ﬁles are stored?
This utility takes all the angst out of the process
By I J Brotherston
/
I had was a computer and cassette,
the forerunner of this program was
developed. It displays a list of all the
programs contained on a tape, in much
the same format as a disk directory.
It was a little simpler than the p re
version, but, with tape turbos making
storage more efﬁcient, I have extended
it considerably.
I use i t mainly fo r storage o f
backup programs, held o n  C60
cassettes. I  have therefore made
allowance for up to 30 programs to
be stored.
In its present form the program
displays a directory of the programs
held on any particular tape, and will
automatically fast forward to the start
of any program selected. I t  also
provides an autorun facility for Basic
programs and will line the tape up
ready to save a selected program. Of
course it can't do this all on its own.
It needs you to put in the trip counter
details from your cassette, program
number and program name ﬁrst. These
are held in the DATA statements.
Even now that I have a disk drive.
I still keep my backup copies on tape,
so the program still gets well used. In
the interests of speed, it is best used
with a tape turbo of some sort, such
as the program given in the November
1985 issue of Your Commodore.
Tape Menu should be the ﬁrst
program o n  your tape. It's fairly
friendly, but not completely foolproof.
It can be customised, and to this end
I have included a list of the variables
used, and what they do. Once you have
ﬁlled in the details of your programs,
you will, at some time, want to either
add, change or delete some details.
Once you have made these changes,
resave Tape menu over the original.
Don't worry, the D ATA statements
have been padded with spaces so that
when you resave, the next program on
the tape will not be overwritten.
Once you have your programs
saved, and have placed the relevant
details into Tape menu, just follow the
on-screen instructions. There are just
a couple of restrictions. You have to
start with a blank tape. You can't just
tack the directory onto the beginning
of any tape and trust to luck. The
timing for the fast forward (lines 440
- 480) is set for my cassette unit, and
cassette units do differ slightly in their
speeds. Even so the counter readings
should be within acceptable limits. If
they a re  n o t, a  l i ttl e  judicious
adjustment of the '14.75' in line 480
should do the trick. Increase it if your
cassette counter is lower than that held
in the program, and decrease i t to
adjust the other way.
I have found th i s t o  b e  a n
invaluable utility for about four years
now, and I hope you will ﬁnd it equally
useful. You can customise it in various
ways, a n d  here are j u st a  fe w
suggestions:
The ti tl e  o f  the tape can be
changed. This is held in line 50.
In line 40 the variables F and L
can be altered to  deﬁne the total
number of entries and number of lines
to each page. If you change F, don't
forget you also have to change the
number of DATA statements as well.
Also, i f you go over 30 entries, you
will need to alter line 650, to increase
the number of pages available. You
don't however have to worry about the
number of lines ﬁtting exactly onto a
page. If you don't have a full page it
will be padded with blank lines.
You can also change the on screen
messages and colours to suit your own
taste, or do away with some of them
altogether to shorten the program.
Well, there you have it. Here are
the list of variables I promised.

T
outstanding new pistol-grip
stick with a smooth, superior
performance that's bound to impress.
It will retail at .1114.99, but we're giving
away ten o f them free to the lucky
winners of our competition.
The Navigator's design is distinctly
futuristic -  in fact, it's not unlike a
Star Trek phaser -  but it's also very
comfortable, with the ﬁre-button
positioned so that the index ﬁnger can
be used, which is perfect for ﬁrst-time
users.
The autoﬁre switch doesn't operate
until the trigger is held, which makes
it perfect for most games, and avoids
the possibility of overshooting through
score tables and menu screens. I n
short, it's an excellent joystick that's
well worth winning!
How to enter
Simply study the two cartoons on this
page and ﬁnd the two differences
between them. When you think you've
found them all, ﬁll in the entry form,
and remember to  also write the
number of differences of the back of
the envelope, otherwise you won't be

will provide end to end action
for both human and computer
players, and leave you feeling either
over-the-moon-Brian or as sick as a
parrot.
First reactions from anyone seeing
a screenshot of this game will be that
EHIS is an International Soccer clone,
but on closer inspection this game goes
a lot deeper, with individual player
statistics, league and cup competitions
and intricate ball control that you must
perfect if you're going to win anything.
EHIS isn't the most friendly o f
programs -  the game opens with a
blank screen, except for a command
bar at the top. Moving the joystick-
controlled cursor to the top accesses
four menus that allow you to deﬁne
game options such as: points for a win,
minutes i n  a  half, changing screen
colours, selecting a  team to  play,
picking the players from the squad
who will play, and deciding whether
it will be a league or cup competition
or just a  friendly match. Whatever
your choice, you're restricted to eight
teams, which is easy enough for a game
in which the emphasis is on action,
not management.
Once you've made your many
decisions, the familiar International
screen appears, but with
•
GAME R EVIEW
a few subtle differences such as
advertising boards. Unlike Inter-
national Soccer, EH IS uses all 11
players in a side -  each has his own
running, tackling, speed and ﬁtness
ratings that will affect how he performs
on the ﬁeld. The ﬁtness rating is
perhap's most important, as this is
reduced for each match played, and
particularly 'heavy tackles that can
mean that your star player plays well
below his best.
After only a few minutes, you'll
begin to appreciate the extra control
EHIS gives you over the players -
instead of the usual press for pass or
hold for shoot style, you can set the
speed, direction and height of the shot,
pass or cross through relatively simple,
joystick moves. So, with practice you
can pass the ball w i th  pinpoint
accuracy across the ﬁeld, lob crosses
into t h e  b o x  a n d  sh o o t f r o m
impossible angles.
When you haven't got the ball, you
can either try and intercept passes,
block the man with the ball or even
slide in for a tackle, but you may end
up giving away a free-kick. You also
have more control over set pieces such
as free-kicks, throw-ins and corners -
a press of the ﬁre button will mean
the kick or the throw will be towards
the player you control at the moment,
though yo u  can leave i t  t o  th e
computer to work out the best place.
The action is accompanied by a
cheering crowd, and a commentary in
the form of a bar at the top o f the
screen that displays who has the ball,
the name o f  the nearest opposing
player, th e  goal scorers and the
direction of free kicks and throw-ins.
Unfortunately, this is most distracting,
as it ﬂashes just as you're concentrating
on threading _a pass through the
opposing defence. It's not particularly
accurate either - I was informed at one
point that a player had scored after
ﬁve minutes, when only four had
passed on the game clock in a game
with only ﬁve-minute halves. I f  they
insist o n  these interruptions, they
should at least be accurate.
Overall, this is a good expansion
of the International Soccer type o f
game, but i t  will disappoint those
looking for a cull player management
game.

Quite simply, it leaves
other word processors
lost for words.
WordPerfect 4.1 for the
Amiga includes many features
not found in other word
processors.
Newspaper style columns can
be displayed on screen,110,000
1/Mrd UK phonetic dictionary,
word-count, background
printing and automatic refor-
matting increase efﬁciency.
Line drawing and rulers,
search/replace and 5-function
maths are invaluable assets.
By using the Amiga's
pulldown menus nearly all
WordPerfect's features are
available at the click of a
mouse. This makes learning
easier than ever before and
using it a real pleasure. But
if you prefer the traditional
function keys there is a
colour coded template to
make life easy.
What you see on the screen
is what will actually print.
This makes good, professional
layouts simple.
Documents are treated as a
whole and not a series of
pages. Reformatting and
repagination after editing are
automatic and very rapid.
However fast you type, you
will never be too fast for
WordPerfect.

undoubtedly set pulses racing throughout the length
and breadth of Britannia, and also cause mounting
excitement amongst role-playing fans, for i t means the
arrival of another Ultima game. The Ultima games have
previously been the standard against which other computer
role-playing games (rpgs) have set themselves. As games
of this type proliferate, can Origin System maintain its place
at the top of the pile?
In Britannia, a whole new underworld has come to light.
This appears to be coupled with a strange evil spreading
through the land, and it was a possible connection between
the two that Lord British was investigating when he was
captured. One member of his party managed to escape to
inform the land of this massive threat to their wellbeing.
With their leader absent, they decide to summon you, an
avatar (see Ultima IV), back to Britannia. Unlike other
rpgs, where your character is decided by random roling
of dice, here you have to answer a series o f moralistic
questions in order to generate your persona for the game.
If you've played any of the other games in the Utima
series, the ﬁrst thing you'll notice is that graphic detail has
been enhanced out of all recognition. Rooms now contain
furniture which can be pushed and pulled around.
Cupboards and desks all have to be searched to see if they
will glean an extra clue or yield a potion. There are even
harpischords that can be played, including one that
transports you to a magical area should you play the correct
tune. M y  one main grumble about the game is that all
this searching takes too long, especially when coupled with
the snail-like pace of the Commodore's disk drive.
You start the game with two other characters in the
party, although you'll soon ﬁnd others willing to join your
cause. Too many in fact, but there is a place where you
can drop them o ff and pick them u p  again later i f
circumstances change.
Information is the key to the game. You start off knowing
precious little about the task in front of you, and only by
talking to the many characters in the game do you start
to get some idea of what's going on. Some folk will merely
pass the time of day, others will give you direct clues, or
refer you to a third person.
There are several mini-quests for you to complete as
well as the main one. Make sure that you write everything
down - you never know what may or may not prove vital.
The characters don't remain static throughout the game
they move about, and go to bed when the sun goes down.
Time is an integral part o f the game, and you'll ﬁnd a
different sort o f person moving round at night than you
would during the day.

Ultima has always had one of the better magic systems
- most characters have some magical ability in the form
of magic points. Spells have to be prepared beforehand
by mixing the appropriate reagents, not all of which are
readily available from your local apothecary. There are 45
different spells, and I mean different, unlike most games,
where you get the same spell in half a dozen guises. You'll
need to change the wind direction, stop time and summon
demons as well as the more mundane curing wounds and
removing traps.
Battles are tactical in nature y o u  can move round
and pick your targets as you see ﬁt, providing you have
a suitable weapon. Each character moves in turn, and how
you organise your party is entirely up to you. Though I'm
all in favour of tactical combat, I felt that the system used
here didn't work quite as well as that used in the recently
released Dungeons and Dragons.
The game is huge, and will take many hours to solve
(estimated time is 100 - 200 hours) as you explore dungeons
and the underworld, towns and castles. Secret doors are
plentiful but even so, most of them are locked, and you'll
need a key to get through them. Try walking into ﬁres!
Sure, you'll get burnt, but there's often something useful
hidden behind the ﬁreplace.
This review has barely touched the detail within the
game. One area where the Ultima series does show its class
over its rivals is in the scenario and atmosphere within the
story, which is totally credible. Add this game to your
collection without delay.

Data
Loader
This handy little utility should
make the task of keying
in Your Commodore listings
an awful lot easier.
By D R Murr
W
realise how difﬁcult a task
it is entering page after page
of listings, even though our checksums
should have made life easier. This
program should make things a little
better.
Data Loader lets you enter data
bytes, o f machine code or whatever,
in blocks of any size you choose. So,
if you pick our standard DATA line
size of 16 bytes, that is also the block
size. When you've entered a block, you
can then enter the checksum t o
validate it. The program also includes
extensive editing facilities.
Now read on...
Getting it in
Two versions o f Data Loader have
been provided -  one for the C64 and
one for the C128. Both are written in
Basic. Please refer to  our Listings
pages to clarify the entry procedure.
Running the program
Since the programs are Basic, simply
LOAD and RUN them to get them
going. Once you start the program, the
program heading will appear and you
will be asked i f you want to load an
existing ﬁle into memory. If you don't
want to continue entering data into a
new ﬁle then you will be prompted for
the block size (8-16). At this prompt
you should enter the number of data
items that are on the lines that you
wish to enter minus 1 to allow for the
checksum that appears at the end of
every line in our listings.
Once the block size has been
entered you will be asked if you want
to enter the data in Hexadecimal or
Decimal format. Following a correct
response to this, you will be asked for
the .Start address o f the data to be
entered. It is worth noting that if you
are continuing entering data t o  a
program that already exists on disk,
the start address, block size, entry
mode and the next address will all be
displayed as soon as you have loaded
in the program.
Once you start entering data you
will see that the program keeps you
informed of the block number that you
are working on and the number o f
blocks that you have entered. Directly

below these y o u  w i l l  see t h e
ADDRESS a n d  D A T A  column
labels.
When you are ready to enter a new
block type 'E'. You may then enter the
relevant data. Characters can be
deleted using the D E L  key. Th e
program will only allow you to use
the keys that are used in your chosen
entry mode (ie. 0-9 in Decimal and 0-
9 plus A-F in Hex mode).
Each time that you ﬁnish entering
a line of data, the checksum of that
line will be displayed alowing you to
compare i t with the listing that you
are entering.
Should you wish to modify any
block that you have entered you can
do this by typing 'M'. Use the delete
key as normal to allow you to change
data items.
Pressing the 'N' and 'P' keys allows
you to view the Next and Previous data
blocks. The 'G ke y allows you to
GOTO the data block that you specify.
The ESC key in Cl28 mode and the
Fl key i n C64 mode act as abort
commands returning you to the main
menu.

It is possible to delete blocks o f
data with the 'D' key. This takes some
time, as once the data block is removed
the rest of the data entered is moved
down into the space that has been
opened. The oposite o f delete is o f
course insert. The 'I' key is used to
perform this function. This function
will cause all data after the point of
insertion to be moved up by one block,
It is of course possible to make a
mistake when deleting data. You will
be pleased to note that the 'R' key will
recover the last data block that was
deleted and insert i t  back i n  i ts
respective place in memory.
Once you have ﬁnished typing in
your data, or you simply want to have
a break, you will o f course want to
save your work. Pressing the 'S' key
will activate this function. I f  the
ﬁlename that you choose already exists
on disk then you will be asked i f you
want to overwrite it,
When you want t o  leave the
program simply enter 'Q' for quit.

To convert the 'DATA LOADER

a companion program '64 D ATA -

the data ﬁle without the End Address

desirable where you may want to load

Note that in other magazines the

however the checksum at the end of

First Steps
When an error message appears on the screen the
greatest culprit is the programmer. k
r
By Norman Doyle
.
. .
T
than the sinking feeling you get
when a  program is chugging
along nicely and the screen scrolls up
a few lines to reveal an operational
error message. What's even more
annoying is the knowledge that ten
times out of ten the programmer is at
fault rather than the program!
Planning is part o f the secret o f
producing perfect programs. Those
that just grow, turn o u t like the
plumbing in my house. Whenever I

o

turn on the tap, water of the correct
denomination appears instantly, the
central heating circulates well and the
toilets ﬂush perfectly -  but all is not
well now that I want to change things
to suit all my new needs.
The problem is the rather inelegant
way the plumbing resembles a collage
of pipes contrived during Picasso's
wildest dream. As Cubist sculpture, it's
ﬁne until it comes to untangling the
mess and I'm now in danger of ﬂushing
with hot water and ﬁlling my kettle
YOUR COMMODORE february 1989
31
from the central heating system! One
false step and the result is chaos.
So it is with Topsy programs. If
your program just 'growed' and you
want to make a small change these are
the errors you could meet:
NEXT without FOR
When a  FOR" NEXT loop has not
been closed properly because a next
statement has been omitted, or in some
way avoided, through bad program
structure, the operating system cannot
trace back to the FOR statement and
this error is generated.
Apart from carelessness, problems
can be caused b y  various syntax
problems. Take this example of badly
nested loops:
10 FOR A=I TO 100
20 FOR B=0 TO 7
30 NEXT A:NEXT B
The A  loop will execute without
any problems but, when the program
meets the N EXT B  command, the
program jumps back to line 20 and
then tries to execute the NEXT A on
line 30 again. Since the operating
system has declared the A  loop
ﬁnished and forgotten, the error
message is generated.
If the variable tags A  and B had
been omitted from line 30, the program
would have executed without any
problems. This is one case when
perfect syntax isn't necessarily the best
policy!
RETURN Without GOSUB
The routines associated with GOSUB
are often bunched at the end of most
programs. This is a situation when the
END statement should always be
inserted before the ﬁrst subroutine. If
this is not done the program reaches
the logical end of the program but then
runs i n to  th e  subroutine, ﬁn d s
RETURN and has nowhere left to go
so the error appears.
10 GOSUB 30
20 R EM TH IS IS  WHERE END
SHOULD BE
30 FOR A= I TO 10
40 PRINT A
50 NEXT A
60 RETURN
Out of DATA
This is the bane o f Basic adventure
programmers o r  machine co d e
program loaders. Often the cause is

difﬁcult to trace but usually it's an
extra comma at the end of a DATA
statement or a full stop instead of a
comma within one of the many lines.
In my experience, the best way to
track down the problem is to add a
few lines at the end of the program
which read the data and prints each
item to the screen. For example, i f
there are 312 items of data the extra
lines would be:
60000 FOR A.1 TO 312
60010 READ AS
60020 PRINT AS
60030 GET BS:IF BS <>CHRS(32)
THEN 60050
60040 GET BS:IF BS < >CHRS(13)
THEN 60040
60050 NEXT
By running this with RUN 60000,
the data will appear. Watch for any
blank lines or unexpected results and
press the space bar to halt the program.
Check the D A T A  and then press
RETURN to continue. You'll soon see
if the DATA is incorrect or if there's
an item missing.
Out Of Memory
Ofﬁcially, this means that the program
is too long for the memory space
allotted to it. Always bear in mind that
the program memory also includes the
space reserved for variables as well as
the program itself. A  sure way to
overrun the computer in a one line
program is to try this:
10 DIM A$(255,255)
The memory isn't large enough by a
long way. Be careful when using
arrays, they can kill a program before
it gets past the ﬁrst line.
Another way to generate the error
is by loading a machine code routine
to 49152 and then trying to load a Basic
driver. Always follow a high memory
load by NEW, it won't hurt the loaded
program and resets the pointers ready
for a normal Basic load.
Undef'd Statement
This appears when a  GOTO o r
GOSUB statement tries to jump to a
non-existent line. A line may not exist
for one o f two reasons: it may have
been erased in error or it may never
have existed in the ﬁrst place.
The latter case is easily corrected
but the former may not be so easy if
the disappearance o f the line is due
BEGINNERS
to the use of a renumber routine which
does not update jump instructions.
Another reason could be through
the elimination o f REM statements.
Many programmers get i n to  the
seemingly neat habit o f  placing
subroutines at lines such as 1000, 2000
etc. Laudable though this may be, they
then indulge i n  the equally good
practice of turning the ﬁrst line into
a REM statement to label the routine.
The mistake is to use the REM line
as the jump address, as in GOSUB
2000, when the ﬁrst active Basic line
may not start until line 2020. Ideally,
a program should be written so that
all o f the R EM statements can be
erased to  leave the program fully
operative. Stick to this rule and you
may never see the undeﬁned statement
message.
ReDIM'd Array
When a  variable is dimensioned i t
should be given its values as close to
the beginning o f  the program as
possible. Never dimension a variable
immediately before it's used because
future modiﬁcations may cause the
line to be processed a second time and
the redimensioned error will occur.
To redimension an array within a
program means t h a t  t h e  C L R
command has to be used ﬁrst. This
will annul all of the variables that have
accumulated whether dimensioned or
not.
Always remember that an array
cannot be altered within a program
simply b y  inserting a  new D I M
command.
Illegal Direct
Some commands can only be used
within a program and not in direct
mode. You can type and use PRINT
AS but you cannot use INPUT AS.
This rule applies to  the GE T
statement as well as INPUT. The ﬁle
versions (GET # and INPUT # ) will
not work in direct mode either.
Break
This is not so much an error as an
information message. It only appears
when a deliberate act occurs, such as
pressing the R U N /STOP key o r
inserting a STOP statement within a
program.
When th e  command appears
during the execution of a program the
message reads something like BREAK
ERROR IN LINE 210. This is the line
that was being executed when the
break was made.
YOUR COMMODORE february 1989
32
Can't Continue
After a break or STOP interruption,
the program can usually be restarted
with CONT. I f  a line is edited after
the break, or i f the program hadn't
even been RUN, the computer can't
CONTinue and tells you so.
If a syntax error has occurred, the
CONT command will also generate
this message.
Syntax
Last but not least, the most common
error is denoted by this message. It
is probably the ﬁrst error message that
any computer user will encounter and
results from incorrectly keying in a
command. Often the fault is a typing
error such as PIRNT or PRIT instead
of PRINT but it can also appear i f
incorrect parameters are given along
with a command.
One other cause occurs when a
reserved word (Basic command) i s
embedded i n a  variable name. The
temptation t o  use variables l i ke
MONEY, D I F F E R E N C E  a n d
TOTAL should be resisted because
they hide keywords ON, IF and TO
which would make the computer read
these as:
M O N
 D IF FERENCE
and
TO TAL
This makes absolute nonsense as
far as the computer's operating system
is concerned or, in other words, the
syntax is in error.
One common example of this kind
of error is when RETURN is pressed
on t h e  R E A D Y .  p ro mp t. T h e
computer sees this as READ Y and
usually an OUT OF DATA ERROR
message will appear. I f  there is a
program i n  memory with D A T A
statements in it and it hasn't yet been
used, the READ Y will attempt to read
in the ﬁrst value. String D ATA will
generate a  T Y P E  M I S M A T C H
ERROR b u t numeric D A T A  will
cause a SYNTAX ERROR because of
the full stop after READY.
Over the past few months, First Steps
has covered all o f the errors to be
found o n  th e  C 6 4  a n d  earlier
Commodore machines but now the
Plus/4, C16 and C I 28 have added
several new errors and the next article
in this series will be looking at these
in detail.

companies -  good in parts. When the home micro
boom started, their early adventures were head-and-
shoulders above anything else produced in this country.
Seemingly, they had the entire market in adventure games
sewn up, but the promise never really materialised. The
inclusion of graphics added nothing to their games, with
decidedly low-resolution pictures that frequently had
nothing to do with the location being described.
Something new was required, and the introduction of
16 bit machines soon led to the pepping up of the graphics.
They were also working on the development of character
interaction_ The idea was that instead of just solving puzzles,
the player also had to enlist the help of some of the people
to be found wandering round the story.
The ﬁrst two games using this system, Knight Orc and
Gnome Ranger, didn't really come off. Whether this was
due to a poor storyline or unfamiliarity with the system
is hard to tell, but reaction was extremely muted.
Ingrid's Back features the heroine o f Gnome Ranger
in a new storyline. Returning back to her home town of
Little Moaning, Ingrid ﬁnds that the town's inhabitants
are under threat of eviction from one Jasper Quick buck,
who is determined t o  build a  marina. This doesn't
particularly concern the townsfolk, as they are under the
impression that the eviction order is a very posh party
invitation.
One o f the main problems Ingrid faces is that most
of the gnomes have experienced her attempts to help them
before, and so are somewhat wary of her ministrations.
In part one of the three load game, Ingrid must get enough
signatures on a petition to protest about the development.
A steamroller threatens to knock down a farm in the
second part, with part o f  the solution being highly
reminiscent of the opening to Hitch-hikers Guide to the
Galaxy, and something that should very much be taken
lying down. Finally, the evil Jasper must be dealt with in
order to ensure that he gets his comeuppance.
The parser is Level 9's usual one, which means very
good indeed. Complex commands are dealt with easily,
although there's no real need to use them. Likewise, there
are no obscure vocabulary terms to  be used. Useful
commands include 'go to somewhere', follow someone, ﬁnd
someone and wait for someone. There are only colour
pictures on the disk version, and not every location is
illustrated, but those that are are of a reasonable quality.
All the gnomes have personalities o f their own, and
it's fun just watching them getting on with their own lives.
The one main character that you'll need to make use of
is your ever-faithful dog Flopsy.

A
owner about a datasette and
most of them won't know what
you're talking about. They may have
seen one but few actually use them.
In the USA, disk drives rule supreme.
Before the appearance of cheaper
drives pver here, cassettes were the
normal storage medium and tedium
was rife. Although cassettes still
account for the majority o f storage
devices, drives a re  mu ch  mo re
common now and you probably know
someone who owns one even i f you
haven't got one yourself.
Commodore 1500 series drives cost
a small fortune even when compared
to the price tag on disk drives for the
Amiga. The reason for this is that the
drive i s  a n  intelligent device,
containing its own 6502 processor. The
advantage o f this is that the drive
doesn't use up very much of the host
computer's memory with a  massive
disk operating system ( D OS ) .
Processors and their related chips are
expensive, and buying a drive is almost
identical to buying a computer from
an electronic viewpoint, hence the
expense.
It all started with the old PET
computers and their 4040 drives, These
were often supplied as twin drive units
housed in a casing that would occupy
an area about four times the size o f
the 1500 series drives. These drives
were used as the models for the 1540
disk drive which was devised t o
accompany the VIC20 computer. You
may have wondered why the syntax
for disk communications contains a
value for a drive number even though
it's always zero. This is a throwback
to the 4040 days, because both drives
had the same device number (8) but
one drive was set as drive 0 and the
other was drive I.
This is not the only hangover from
the old days. Examine the User's
Manual and you'll ﬁnd an entry for
the DUPLICATE command which
HARDWARE R EVIEW
Buying a disk drive is the ﬁrst step, but where can it all
lead?
By Kerry Fowler
says that this is not for single drives.
This does not mean that it will work
if you buy a second drive because it
requires a drive number of one rather
than a device number other than eight.
Similarly, the copy command will only
copy a ﬁle under a different name onto
the same disk. On the 4040, this was
not the case.
Some of the imported features are
not so amusing. The well publicised
save-and-replace bug which makes this
command a dodgy one to use has most
people u s i n g  t h e  S C R A T C H
command to  remove a  ﬁle and a
normal SAVE to restore the updated
version of the erased ﬁle.
The 1540 gave way to the faster
(believe it or not!) 1541 and 1541C for
the C64, Plus4 and C16 which, in turn,
gave way to the 1570 and 1571 for the
C128. All the drives are compatible
and can be used with any o f  the
machines but the 1541 will not handle
differently formatted disks, such as
CP/ M or MS-DOS, for the C128 and
the machines devised for the 1541 can't
easily access the Cl28 drives' advanced
features. Some of the older, software-
based fast loaders can't operate on the
1570/ I and the best advice is to buy
the drive designed for your particular
machine, no matter what a fast-talking
salesman may be trying to fob you off
with.
The Plus4 and C16 computers had
their own drive which was rather
revolutionary. Prior to the appearance
of the 1551, Commodore had settled
for serial communications for both
drives and printers. This means that
all information is sent down a single
wire as a long queue of bits rather than
bytes. T h e  1551 u se d  parallel
communications which meant that
data was taken in through the user port
a whole byte a t a  time. Simple
mathematics shows that this improves
data transmission eightfold and the
actual improvement was even greater
than this.

to their experiments. Recently, the
1581 has appeared which combines the
capacity of a 3.5 inch disk with faster
disk access. It's an excellent drive but
fated to be the preserve of those who
keep large databases or who wish to
standardise their new I 6-bit machine
with their trusty old 8-bit.

majority of the CM range available to
them, but only in C64 emulation. The
indie drives are very good, compact
and relatively cheap but incompatible
with systems such as Dolphin DOS,
though they often produce good

results with cartridges. Don't believe
some of the literature that claims that
these drives are faster than the 1541.
If there is any difference at all, it is
minimal and failed to show up in the
tests we performed several months
ago.
There are four main cartridges for
the C64 and only one for the C128
in its natural state.
The Expert, Freeze Frame, Final
cartridge and Action Replay form the
C64 line up (all are compatible with
the Cl28 and 64 mode). As far as speed
is concerned, th e  Action Replay
Professional IV's Warp 25 and the
Expert's Rocket system provide the
fastest loaders possible. Action Replay
has a slight edge because it is easier
to use, but the Expert would be a better
overall bargain i f  Tri logic would
release the secret of programming its
RAM chip, Freeze Machine's Lazer
system runs at about half of this speed
and has fewer utilities on offer. The
Final Cartridge i s  bristling w i th
facilities, but its fastload is slightly
slower than Lazer. I know of several
people who swear by this cartridge but
personally I'd rather swear at it.
For my money, the Action Replay
cartridge wins hands down both on the
grounds o f speed and facilities. This
is especially true fo r drive owners
because the monitor can be used to
write and execute programs fo r
wedging into the disk drive's operating
system.
Financial Systems So ftw a re
market the Warp Speed cartridge for
the C128. This is switchable for use
in the C64 mode o r  C128 mode.
Although it works with a straight C64
machine, I can't really recommend it
because, despite its go-faster name, its
speed loader is pathetic even when
compared to the Final Cartridge. It's
great advantage is that it is the only
Cl28 speciﬁc cartridge and sports a
very impressive monitor which has a
drive interrogation function similar to
the Action Replay together with an
impressive range o f  toolkit-type
commands.
Porpoise Built?
Although there were three hardware
fast loaders available a t one time,
Date! and Trilogic seem to have pulled
out of the stakes and Dolphin DOS
from Evesham Micros has a clear ﬁeld.
At twice the price of a cartridge, you
may be wondering why I  mention
Dolphin at all, I t  is no faster than
Warp 2 5  a n d  i t s  m o n i to r  i s
rudimentary when compared t o
HARDWARE R EVIEW
Action Replay. Its one main advantage
is that i t doesn't use a  special disk
storage format which is the secret of
Warp 25 and Rocket. Instead, it uses
parallel loading to increase its speed.
This means that it will load ordinary
programs a n d  t h e  ma j o ri ty o f
commercial programs a t lightning
speeds.
The one disadvantage of Dolphin
is that it relies on a chip change in
the computer and the disk drive. The
drive modiﬁcation is fairly easy to do
but the replacement R OM fo r the
computer can be awkward. This is not
a job for the rank amateur because
most ROMs are securely soldered into
the circuit board. When I installed my
Dolphin DOS, i t meant desoldering
the original R OM, ﬁddling about
soldering in a chip socket and after
that it was plain sailing. The risk is
obvious, one small slip of the soldering
iron and you can wave goodbye to
your 64.
The C128 modiﬁcation only works
in C64 mode with a 1541 but, with
earlier models, installation is simple
because the R OM  chip is already
housed in a socket. Simply lever out
the old ROM and bring in the new.
One big advantage of Dolphin is
that it can be modiﬁed to handle two
disk drives, opening up the possibility
of superfast disk backups. It's expen-
sive but very highly recommended as
the fastest standard disk system on the
market. Even the best cartridge can
only load standard ﬁles at half the
speed of Dolphin DOS. On the other
hand, owners of indie drives can forget
about this system because it's devised
solely for the 1541.
A cheaper solution to disk backups
lies in the Fast Hack'em disk from
Datel. This carries a variety of copiers
and nibblers but one facility which is
particularly spectacular is the two
drive auto disk copiers, These wedge
a program into the drives which takes
advantage o f their intelligent chips.
Once the program is loaded from the
C64, the drives can be disconnected
from the computer and left to do their
own thing. The speed is amazing and
takes less time than normal disk
formatting. Once one disk has been
copied, the drives will carry on copying
with new master and destination disks,

No matter how careful you are with can
your drive, the time will come when to
it becomes unreliable and starts issuint resi
spurious error messages. The cause it slac
generally a speed variation due to wear i
but this is quite simple to correct for eat
yourself. To  check the speed, you'll son
need a disk alignment kit. The hest D
one that I've found is the Drive Doctor the
from Trilogic. Compared t o  the
alternatives, it is cheap but thorough
and has th e  advantage th a t the
software is supplied o n  tape rather
than disk. The reason for this apparent
abberation o n  th e  p a r t o f  the
manufacturers brings us back to the
widespread use of disk drives in the
States, All the alignment disks apart
from Trilogic's are produced in the
USA, where it is a fairly safe bet that
a friend will have a  working drive
which can be used to load the software.
In Britain, this is not so likely and
Trilogic are to  be commended for
using their common sense. Drive
Doctor r u n s  speed, hysteresis,
alignment, s t o p  p o s i ti o n  a n d
movement tests o n  the drive. The
alignment test should only be used as
a l a s t  re so rt. Investigate t h e
possibilities o f  d i rty o r  broken
mechanical parts o r  electronically
based speed problems ﬁrst. If these fail
to show up any fault then you may
as well try re-alignment because, even
if you can't actually ﬁx the drive at
the end o f the day, you would have
had to  send i t away for re-aligning
anyway!
The s m a l l  b u t  beautifully
formatted manual that is provided
with the ki t also carries a  warning
about quiet stops. These are little wire
clips that replace the heavier metal

disks.

stops which are supplied with the
drive. As far as I'm concerned they
are simply another application for a
paperclip. Quiet stops are purely
cosmetic devices which stop the drive
from making that loud hammering
noise when formatting a disk. The stop
is hard stop for one good reason, the
drive uses it so that it can orientate
itself with relation to the disk. If the
stop gives slightly, and a quiet stop
certainly does, the head will lose track
of its real position, formatting will be
off line and the odd error message will
be returned.
While I'm on the subject o f dire
warnings, fast formatters are also
pretty evil devices. When formatting
starts, even the most solid of hard stops
is subjected to violent vibrations as the
head bounces off it at high speed. This
can even fracture the resin that is used
to hold the stop screw in place. The
result is the possibility o f the screw
slackening and the stop moving which
is a situation even worse than that
caused b y  q u i e t stops, though
somewhat less likely. I even switch off
Dolphin DOS when I format a disk
these days because I have found that
occasionally a  disk i s incorrectly
formatted. The problem with this fault
is that it doesn't show up until I start
to use the disk.
Bits and Bobs
Disk doubling may be classed as
another bad practice but so far I've
had no trouble. This is the rather
logical act o f cutting a write enable
notch in the opposite side of the disk
so that it can be turned over and used
upside down. This means that the
reverse side of the disk can be used
to store information. Referred to as
hippies, these disks have twice the
storage space of the undoubled disk.
There are two potential problems
that can arise with a doubled disk.
First, the disk may be classiﬁed as a
single-sided disk because it has failed
the quality test on its reverse surface.
Secondly, the normally unused side of
the disk runs on a felt pad which causes
friction and can rub o ff the oxide
coating. Wi th  a  doubled disk this
means vital sectors may wear thin and
eventually end up in a heap on the
pad! I f  you go in for disk doubling,
check the felt pad every couple o f

Disk Notchers can be purchased
from Datel and quite a few computer
shops but, if you're not too bothered
about the disks appearance, a  hole
punch such as those used for making
holes in paper for clip ﬁle storage can
be pressed into service. It's all a case
of accurate positioning. C u t to o
shallow and you'll not remove enough
of the sleeve, cut too deep and you'll
perforate the disk itself.
Finally, just a short mention about
disk boxes. Don't be seduced by the
latest compact box which folds Out like
a cassette case — it may be too easy
to trap your disks when you close the
box again. I favour the boxes which
have a lift-up lid, they generally hold
more disks and they offer better value
for money because they're less likely
to get broken.
Look after your drive and it will
last for years. Despite the heavy use
and ill-treatment my drives get, they
have lasted for ﬁve years. That doesn't

them, otherwise why else would the

1 thought that it would be best
to l e a v e  everyone w i t h
something to think about. Basically,
I'm dealing with sprites in the border,
Commodore said it couldn't be done
but many programmers, from Jeff
Minter and Tony Crowther down-
wards (or upwards for that matter),
have proved that it is not only possible
but also practical.
Type in the ﬁrst listing and run it
with SYS 49152 to see what sprites
in the border look like. Isn't it wonder-
ful? Well, one thing I'd like to say is
that there aren't any sprites in the
border. No, I know you can see them
but they're not actually on the border!
Examine the disassembly and we
can see what's happening. The screen
is split at raster 32 and F9. What's
happening is that the screen colour
changes between position F9 (near the
bottom of the screen) and position 32
near the top. These more o r  less
coincide with the border position and
the program further convinces the
viewer by changing the screen from
dark blue t o  pale blue. Change
location $2039 to seven and you can
see the true situation.

Now we have a screen which has
a screen colour and tw o  different
border colours. We've extended the
screen interrupt to  colour over the
border. This is now inaccessible screen
space. There are no memory locations

for the band at the top and bottom
of the screen. A s  yo u  can see,
inaccessible is not strictly true because
the sprites can access this area and,
thanks t o  th e  border n o  longer
existing, they can be seen.
If you examine the programming
of the sprites you'll see that there is
nothing particularly clever going on.
The only special treatment is that some
of the sprite location values used
wouldn't normally be accessed fo r
visible sprites.
The positioning o f  the raster
interrupts is crucial but you might like
to alter them to see what happens. The
values are stored at $C003 and $C004
so with the interrupt running the
values can be changed from Basic with
POKE 49155, XXX and POKE 49156,
XXX, Try values o f 252 ($FC) and
247 ($F7) respectively to start with.
Border sprites are really just a
whimsical use of the interrupt facilities
but they show all of the basic elements.
First of all, the interrupt must be
se up after suspending the IRQ system.
This is done with the SE! command.
Now the parameters can be changed
without fear of a crash resulting. Next
the locations $DCOD and $DDOD
must be set correctly. Th e  start
location of the routine which is called
during each IR() should then be stored
in locations $0314 and $0315 in low
byte/high byte order.
YOUR COMMODORE february 1989
41A1'41V
Now a decision has to be made.
Will the interrupt be linked to  the
raster scan or just happen whenever
it can? If raster linked the point must
be set i n  location $D012. Such
applications would be fo r  screen
splitting, scrolling, border sprites,
more than eight screen sprites at a time
or for occasions when the screen is
disrupted by a slightly longer interrupt.
Location $D01 A should now be
set, then the interrupts can be recalled
by C L I and the routine left via a
standard RIS.
Apart from the essential program
within th e  interrupting ro u ti n e
certain other elements should b e
included. Most importantly, location
$D019 must contain a value o f one.
This can be done at any point within
the routine, I normally include it as
part of the exit routine.
Another consideration is whether
a keyscan is needed. If it is, the ﬁnal
command should be i M P  SEMI. I f
the scan is not required the registers
must be reset.
When an interrupt occurs, the
current accumulator, X register and Y
register values are pushed onto the
stack. Any routine must clear all of
its own parameters off the stack even
before the •IMP SEA3I command. If
this is not done, there is a danger that
the computer will crash when the
interrupt is over.
•

To reset the registers use this
routine to close the interrupt:
PLA
TAY
PLA
TAX
PLA
RTI
Sometimes it is necessary to have
two o r more alternating interrupts.
During e a ch  i n te rru p t ro u ti n e
locations $0314 and $0315 must be
changed. It's not necessary to turn off
the interrupts this time and you'd be
ill-advised to do so because the routine
itself is the interrupt. Simply poke the
low and high bytes into the correct
locations. If the two routines form a
double split for screen manipulations,
the raster value at location $D012 will
also have to be changed.
The best way to come to terms with
interrupts i s b y experimentation.
Things won't always go your way but
you'll soon become proﬁcient a t
knocking up routines that will stun and
amuse your friends.
In the interests of clarity, I've not
used th e  most efﬁcient routines
possible so that could be a starting
FDump
F
a small routine that sits i n
memory, from 49152 onwards,
and will send a whole text screen to
the printer every time you hit the Fl
key.
The program is initially activated
by entering SYS 49156. If, however,
you want to use FDump frozen inAide
a Basic program, or in direct mode,
SYS 49191 will do the trick.
Getting it in
The program is a small machine code
routine in the form of a Basic loader.

point for learning. Go through your
back issues of May I Interrupt and see
if you can compress the routines to
save memory by using an interrupt
counter. This i s an alternative to
resetting the locations at $0314. A byte
of memory is laid aside to act as a
counter. I f  your example has two
alternating interrupts, the location, or
ﬂag, is set to zero initially. Loading
this into the accumulator will set the
zero ﬂag in the status register so a
simple BEQ command will execute the
correct routine. In this branch routine,
the ﬂag will be set to a value of I and
the next time the interrupt is executed
it will skip the BEQ branch and
execute the second routine which
follows on.
The series has, I hope, given food
for thought and guidance to  those
whose curiosity outstripped their
technical knowledge.
In future issues o f the magazine
you'll ﬁnd many other examples o f
interrupt-driven software which you
should now be able to  understand
more easily. Well it's time to pull the
plug and execute a ﬁnal RTI to mark
the end of the series.

and take note o f  this role-playing game from
Electronic Arts. To  start with, Mars Saga has a
science ﬁction rather than a fantasy setting. This is only
the second game of this type I've come across that gets
away from dwarves, dungeons and the like, although I know
that several other futuristic titles are also about to appear.
The second feature is the storyline, where you attempt
to save yourself rather than rid the world of evil, although
I suspect that accomplishing the ﬁrst part might very well
involve the second. The year is 2055. Mars is a combination
of prison colony and mining deveopments, and it's into
this environment that you manage to crash your spaceship.
As your craft is a total write-off, you appear to be stuck
here until you can learn sufﬁcient credits to buy yourself
a new one.
Searching around for a job, you hear that all contact
has been lost with a new outpost at Proscenium. Perhaps
you might be interested in investigating why? Of course
you are, even though the threat of danger is considerable.
Before you get that far though, you'll need to take on a
few other little jobs to earn the money to equip yourself
properly.
You also discover that the task is impossible i f you
attempt it single-handedly, so a visit to the local bars to
try a spot of recruitment is also in order. At the start of
the game, would-be heroes are ten a penny, and you can
only persuade one other person to join you. Future recruits
come only when you start earning a reputation for yourself.
Character development is based on learning new skills
- how to use different weapons, learning new languages
and so on. Some skills such as gambling can be developed
through constant use. Most of the others though, need to
be learned, which in turn means paying the necessary to
be trained. You can only progress though when you're

experienced enough, so you have to keep popping into
universities and the like to see if they're prepared to teach
you anything yet.
Again, you'll have to decide whether to recruit specialists
into your team or jack-of-all-trades. Amongst the skills you
can learn are medicine, electrics and programming. This
is an especially useful skill, as it means that you can start
hacking your way into the various databases you come
across, as you try to gain access to information that might
give an important clue.
Combat is the one area of the game that I didn't feel
comfortable with, though it is hailed as one of the strong
parts o f the game. The battleﬁeld is presented as a  top
down Ga u n tl e t
you issue commands to each of your team members in turn,
telling them where to move and who to attack with what
weapon. Then you sit back and watch it all happen before
entering your instructions for the next round.
The result though is one confused mess. Combat is much
better decided on an individual basis, using surprise and
speed o f reaction to vary who gets in the ﬁrst blow. I f
all this proves too much for you, you can opt to let the
computer ﬁght your battles for you. The only problem with
this approach is that the computer's appreciation of battle
tactics is limited to say the least, and I found that I was
getting my team members killed too regularly.
Combat apart, Mars Saga should appeal to  anyone
preferring laser pistols to swords, and hacking to magic.
The presentation is ﬁrst class, with an excellent automapping
routine which adds considerably to the game's playability,
and makes it well worth investigating.

Ninja at the end o f 1987,
everyone, including cynical
old me, thought that it was the last
word in kung-fu games. The stunning
3D-graphics and combat games tied
into a n  arcade adventure was a
winning combination. I suppose, in a
world full of sequels, (Bard:v Tale III
and U l ti ma  V  fo r example), we
shouldn't be surprised that there were
more on the way.
Once again, yo u  control th e
invisible warrior, the new ninja master
Armakuni, who gained the highest
ofﬁce after completing the last game
by purging h i s o w n  order and
regaining control of the island of Lin
Fen. So, you're involved in a training
session with the elite ninjas when
suddenly a pulsating light surrounds
you, and you're ripped from you own
time and space only to reappear in the
middle of Central park, New York, for
another battle with your arch enemy
Kunitoki, the evil Shogun.
You begin the game confused, but
conﬁdent o f your ﬁghting abilities,
despite the fact you have no idea where
you are and what you will face. To
make things worse, you materialise
trapped inside a bandstand. Behind a
curtain, you ﬁnd a hack room and your
ﬁrst combat opponent, but a few well-
timed kicks and punches should ﬂoor
him and reveal the way out into the
park itself. There yo u  w i l l  ﬁn d
policemen who have been corrupted
by Kunitoki and attack you on sight.
Most are unarmed, and light you on
equal terms, but others wield clubs and
some even throw shuriken stars, so
your ﬁrst task must be to ﬁnd some
weapons and equal the odds.
These weapons, and other useful
objects, w i l l  appear i n  the most
awkward places, either behind a
particularly tough opponent, o r on
high narrow ledges that may cost you
one of your four valuable lives. Once
you're suitably armed, you may live
long enough to escape from the park
into downtown Manhattan.
Out in the city, you'll face new

played Dungeons and Dragons, these
correspond roughly to cleric, druidic,
magic user and illusionist-type spells.
Unfortunately, the name of any spell
to be cast has to be typed in full, so
that means more Japanese to learn.
Why a system of mnemonics or a menu
couldn't be used I don't know but, the
result is decidedly user-unfriendly.
All commands are entered as single
keystroke entries via the keyboard,
more or less a direct crib from the
Ultima series o f games (in fact the
whole game has a decided Ultima feel
to it, right down to the graphics). Not
all of these are easy on the memory
though, and I kept typing '0' to open
something and ﬁnding myself in the
speech menu (0=orate). Having said
that, once you do decide to talk to
someone, you have several options
available to you. 'Chat' starts a general
conversation, whereas 'talk' attempts
to elicit information, although you
usually have to pay for this. 'Inquire'
allows you to  ask about a  speciﬁc
subject. All trading is also done via
the 'orate' menu.
The game is set in the land of Lorn,
and there's plenty for you to explore
- 16 different continents, dungeons

you must stop him at all costs. There

If Last Nirtia had one fault, is was
the fact that you could take as long

considerably. Last Ninja 11 solves this
problem by allowing your defeated

gave them, and rise up to challenge
you again if you hang around too long.

adds to  the price but increases the

to perfect the k  ung-fu armed and

of a disk drive promises an end
to th e  tedium and bother
associated with tape. On the whole,
I think that the drives deliver most of
what they promise. There are however
three major drawbacks:
* Since the serial port is used, the drives
are a little slow.

* A full DOS is not supplied.
* The manual is up to Commodore's
usual appalling standards.
Fear not - this article will give you
the introduction the manual fails to
deliver.

First, some general points o n
Commodore's approach to disk drives.
One point worth remembering is that
most Commodore disk drives respond
to the same system of commands. If,
like me, you cut your teeth on the
PETs, this means that changing to a
64/ 1541 combination is simple and
painless. The main exception is the
1571, which is a double-sided drive.
Unlike many drives, the CBM disk
drive is self-contained - it has its own
CPU, RAM and ROM routines. This
means that you can often leave the
drive to  perform a  task while you
continue to  bash a t the computer.
Some copy packages, such as Fast
Hackem, use this to allow two drives
to w o r k  together w i th o u t t h e
computer! Similarly, some software
uses the disk's routines and RAM to
ensure copy protection.
Let's look at what a ﬂoppy disk
is. If you look at one you will see that
it is a square rigid envelope containing
a brown disk. There is an oval window
on each side and a small circular hole
by the central opening. A notch is cut
on one side of the envelope. The two
windows are used by the drive to read
and write data to the disk. The two
small holes are called 'index holes'. The
notch is the write protect -  i f it is
covered you cannot write to the disk.
The disk is inserted with the label
uppermost and to the rear.
On the 1541 and 1570 disk drives
only one side of the drive is used to
record data. Disks are sold as either
single or double-sided. On the whole
they are the same beast. When disks
are tested during production, those
disks which have both sides o f the
required standard are sold as double-
sided. I f  only one side is acceptable,
they are sold as single-sided. As a
consequence, you can generally use the
ﬂip side of the disk by simply turning
it over, but you must accept that it
may not be as reliable as the correct
side. In addition disks contain a lining
which collects dust off the magnetic
medium. If you turn the disk over, this
dust may be ejected into the drive
mechanism causing problems. There
are mixed views on the seriousness of
this aspect and some software does
come on both sides of a disk. At the
end o f the day you must make the
choice.
The disk is subdivided into 35
concentric tracks - a  bit like a record
I suppose. These tracks are subdivided
into sectors. Since the lengths of the
tracks va ry depending o n  th e i r
position on the disk, the number of
sectors per track also varies (from 16
to 20). When you get a new disk, the
medium is quite random and useless
for storage. Before you can use the disk
you must Format it. This action lays
down the track and sector pattern as
a sequence of magnetic information.
As part of the formatting process the
system allocates Track 18 as the Block
Availability Map (HAM). The BAM
keeps track o f where ﬁles are stored
on the disk and the information needed
to create the directory. Bu t that's
enough technical stuff -  let's get on
to using the drive.
In order to use the drive you need
a disk operating system (DOS). The
DOS provides the means by which you
can copy, delete, rename ﬁles and get
the directory. The main drawback with
the CBM systems is that on the whole,
no simple means o f  sending DOS
commands is provided. There are,
however, add-on packages which give
easy access to DOS commands (more
on them later).
You will note that the default
device number of the disk drive is 8
(you can change it but it involves some
surgery under the drive's lid). In the
old double drives, the individual drives
were assigned 0 and I  to  allow you
to differentiate between th e m .
Nowadays, the single drive is assigned
an identiﬁer of O. You can append this
identiﬁer to any DOS command.
The prime piece o f  information
available i s the directory. This i s
LOADed as a simple BASIC-style ﬁle
which is then LISTed. This is done
by using:
LOAD"S",8
There is a draw-back to this method
of getting a  directory. Since the
directory is loaded as a BASIC type
ﬁle, i t  will overwrite any BASIC
program already in the machine. The
only way around this problem is to
use a machine code routine to display
the directory direct to the screen.
Figure 1 shows an example o f  a
directory.
YOUR COMMODORE february 1989
45
The top line tells you about the disk's
name. The zero on the extreme left
represents the drive number. Next
comes the disk name followed by the
two character identiﬁer. Th e  2 A
represents the version of DOS used.
The ﬁles on the disk are listed below
the header line. The left hand number
represents the size of the ﬁle in blocks
(one block is 256 bytes long so you
can easily work out how big a ﬁle is).
Next comes the ﬁle name and lastly
the ﬁle type. There are several different
types o f  ﬁle. The most commonly
encountered types are:
• PRG - This is assigned to a BASIC
program.
• SEQ - This is a sequential ﬁle.
• REL - This is a relative ﬁle.
The BLOCKS FREE message is self
explanatory. On an empty disk you
have 664 blocks (about 170K) free.
The SAVE, LOAD and VERIFY
commands operate exactly as with the
cassette drive, except that you use a
device number of 8 or 9 (as mentioned
earlier). Similarly, a secondary device
number is used to force a LOAD to
a speciﬁc address. ie:
LOAD "MYFILE",8,1
There is also a REPLACE and SAVE
option. This has the syntax:
SAVE " 0 : M Y  FILE"
Normally i f you try to SAVE a ﬁle
to disk with the same name as a ﬁle
already on the disk you will get an
error. The REPLACE and SAVE
option overcomes this problem and
over-writes the ﬁle. It has been said,
however, that this routine might have
a bug in it which leads to the joining
up of ﬁles on the disk. It is believed
that this occurs when the disk is getting
full and there is insufﬁcient space for
the new ﬁle. The bug is certainly
recognised on the early DOS] but it
is uncertain whether later versions
have it. The bug is fairly insidious and
its e ffe c ts  m a y  n o t  b e co me
immediately obvious. 1 never use the

REPLACE and SAVE option. I either
SAVE ﬁles as a sequence of versions
(eg SOU R C E!, SOURCE.2....etc)
with periodic weeding o f the oldest
versions or delete the previous version
before saving the new. This approach
has never given me any problems.
The main route to the disk drive
is by opening a command channel and
then sending the command down it.
This channel (number 15) can be
opened with:
OPEN 15,8,15
This is followed by the DOS command
in quotation marks.
Let us consider the format (NEW)
command. When you format the disk
you must supply a disk name and a
two character identiﬁer. Imagine that
you want to format a disk with the
name "WOMBAT" and the identiﬁer
99. The format command then has the
syntax:
OPEN 15,8,I5,"NO:WOMBAT,99":
CLOSE 15
If you wish to reformat a previously
formatted disk you can omit the
identiﬁer. I n  this case, the syntax
would be:
OPEN 15,8,15,"NO:WOMBAT":
CLOSE 15
It is a wise precaution not to use the
same name/identiﬁer on more than
one disk. When you use a disk the disk
drive reads the directory and the BAM
If you replace the disk with another
with the same name and identiﬁer, the
disk drive will become confused and
not realise that the disk has been
changed. This can cause serious
problems. Once you have formatted
the disk you can proceed to SAVE and
LOAD programs.
Once you have ﬁles on a disk, you
will want to manipulate them. DOS
offers a number of handy commands
to help you.
Initialise
This command has a number of uses.
It can be used to force the disk drive
to read the details off a disk. It also
resets the read/ write head to  the
directory track. This latter feature is
useful i f a piece of software has left
the head in an "illegal" position. The
syntax of the command is:
OPEN 15,8,15,1"
Scratch
This command deletes the speciﬁed
ﬁle. It has the syntax:
OPEN 15,8,I5,"SO:FILENAME"
Rename
This renames the speciﬁed ﬁle:
OPEN 1 5 , 8 , 1 5 , " R O : N E W
NAME=OLD NAME"
Here the ﬁle called "OLD NAME" is
renamed to "NEW NAME".
Validate
If you have performed a number of
actions creating and deleting ﬁles the
operating system can have a problem
reallocating disk space and thereby
leave you with less storage space than
normally possible. Validate w i l l
recover this space.
OPEN I5,8,15,"V"
Copy
This duplicates a speciﬁed ﬁle on the
drive and has the syntax:
OPEN 15,8,15,"COPY=ORIGINAL"
The ﬁle "ORIGINAL" is copied under
the name "COPY" on the same disk.
This command is interesting in that
it operates independently o f  the
computer. If you try it you will notice
that control is immediately returned
to the computer and the disk drive
quietly churns on until the copy is
made.
You will have noticed that the disk
drive has a small light on its front.
This light glows red when the drive
is working. If an error such as a missing
ﬁle or disk error is encountered, this
light ﬂashes. Clearly you may want to
know what has caused the error. Some
errors, such has trying to L OAD  a
non-existent ﬁle are obvious, since the
computer will tell you it can't ﬁnd the
ﬁle. Others are not so obvious. The
answer is to use the following lines as
a stand-alone program or as part of
a larger program:
10 
O
P
E
N
 1 5 , 8 , 1 5 :
I N P U T  1  5 ,E N ,E M $ ,E T,E S :
CLOSE 15
20 PRINT EN,EMS,ET,ES
The variables have the following
meanings:
YOUR COMMODORE february 1989
46
EN -  this is the number of the error
(look in the back of your drive manual
for details).
EM$ -  this tells you what the error
is.
ET - this tells you on which track the
error occurred.
ES -  this tells you on which sector
the error occurred.
The latter two values are only of use
if an error has been detected in the
disk contents or when a defect occurs
in the disk. You will notice that once
the program has RUN the light on the
drive stops ﬂashing. As, an example,
if you try to LOAD a ﬁle when there
is no disk in the drive and then RUN
the above program you will get the
output:
74 DRIVE NOT READY 00
If the drive tries to read a track with
an error present, i t  can become
confused and the drive will attempt to
position the head at the ﬁrst track. This
is attempted several times, leading to
the head hammering against the end
stop. Some software uses deliberately
created disk errors as copy protection
leading to this "hammering" every time
you use the drive. This can knock the
drive head out o f alignment leading
to read write problems. The following
simple program should disable the
"hammering" mechanism (until you
turn the drive off!):
10 OPEN 15,8,15
20 PRINT 1 5 ,"M - W"; C H M  (106)
C H M (0) CHRS (1) CHRS (133)
30 CLOSE 15
There are products available which
help you to get over the slow speed
of the drives and the ﬁddly disk
operating system. You can ﬁnd several
advertisements fo r  these i n  Yo u r

looking at are Action Replay (Datel),
the Expert Cartridge (Trilogic) and
The Fi n a l  Cartridge (Evesham

Expert and Final cartridges.
I hope this introduction to using
the drive will be of value. I am aware
that I haven't touched on using data
ﬁles, but this in itself is a fairly big

anathema to me. I'd read so
many holier-than-thou articles
about how ﬂowcharts are the only way
to produce well-structured programs,
that it left me feeling inadequate. I am
a programmer, but charts left me cold
- only when I analysed my methods
did I  realise that I'd  been doing
informal ﬂowcharting for years with-
out realising it.
What happens when you sit down
to write a program? First of all you
decide what the program is going to
do. Then, if you're anything like me,
the next thought is whether there's a
program that can be modiﬁed some-
where in the software collection, or if
not, are there any routines that can
be 'borrowed' piecemeal?
You may not realise it, but already
you've stepped Onto the slippery slope
to ﬂowcharting. Basically, what's
happening is that you're breaking
down the job into smaller parts. Take
the archetypal Sp a ce  In v a d e r
program, and imagine that you've sat
down to write it. First you have to
analyse what it does.
Immediately you consider the
program, certain elements leap out at
you. Let's work out how a  simple

could be written. I n  making this
decision, we've started planning,
because the aim o f the project has
already deﬁned the start and end
points of the project.
decimal input

To continue, we must now deﬁne
more clearly what the end result will
contain.
For most purposes, hexadecimal
numbers are particularly useful when
high and low byte values of a number
have to  be calculated. So why not
make this routine convert a number
to h e x, a n d  p ri n t o u t  th e  h e x
conversion plus the high and low bytes
in hex and decimal.

Now we know where we're going,
we can now consider the program in
greater detail.
A number has to be entered for
the computer to work on. Rather than
converting to hex and then back again,
it would seem logical to split the high
and low byte at this point. Next, the
hex number has to be calculated, and
then all o f the information can be
printed out.
decimal input
split high and low byte
convert to hex values
print out
hexadecimal number
high byte dec & hex
low byte dec & hex

The program is now taking a very
deﬁnite shape, but the hex calculation
is still a little vague. From the rough
diagram, it's clear that at this point
there are three values ﬂoating around:
the decimal number and the high and
low bytes in decimal. This means that
two of the numbers are less than 255,
and can be treated in the same way
for conversion t o  hex. Th e  tw o
numbers c a n  t h e n  s i m p l y  b e
concatenated to yield the full hexa-
decimal number. This would give all
the values necessary fo r  the ﬁnal
printing section.
Since it's necessary to put both the
high byte and the low byte through
the same process, a subroutine would
remove the need for repeating the same
program lines twice. A breakdown of
this routine is needed.
Each number has to be split further
into a high and low nybble. The value
of each is then converted into character
ready for recombining in the ﬁnal hex
conversion. Once again there's a
repeated action and, therefore, another
subroutine.
Decimal Input
1: Program
split high and low byte

3: Subroutine

convert numbers over nine to letter
code
return to conversion routine
This is a fairly simple example of
an informal ﬂowchart, and in this case
it is probably quite sufﬁcient. The
proof of the effectiveness of the ﬂow-
chart comes when the program is
written.
Decimal input is simply an INPUT
command with a suitable text message:
10 INPUT "WHAT IS THE DECI-
MAL VALUE";NO
A simple mathematical calculation
splits the high and low bytes:
20 H I = INT( NO/ 256 M O  = NO -
HI * 256
Calculating the high byte and the
low byte in hex involves the two inter-
active subroutines. In the case of the
call from the main routine, variables
are swapped before calling and after
returning from the routine.
30 TEMP = HI:GOSUB 100:HIS =
TEMPS
40 TEMP = LO:GOSUB 100:LOS =
TEMPS
This printing out o f  the infor-
mation is simply a case of ﬁtting the
correct variables with suitable text:
50 PR IN T NO;" = $"; HIS; LOS:
PRINT "H I- B Y TE  =  " H I ,  " $ " ;
HIS:PRINT "LO-BYTE = " $ " ;
LOS
60 END
YOUR COMMODORE february 1989
48
Amplifying the subroutines, the
nybbles have to  be calculated and
assigned to  suitable variables. The
values obtained are then converted to
character values, a n d  th e n  th e
characters are stored as a string, which
is built up into the hexadecimal byte
value before handing back to the main
routine.
100 T=(TEMP AND 240)/ 16:GOSUB
150:TEMPS = CHRSM
130 T= TE M P  A N D  15:GOSUB
1 50:TEM PS = TEMPS + CH R$(T)
140 RETURN
The character value calculation
which forms the second subroutine
merely adds 48 to the numerical value
of the nybble. This means that the
character value for one to nine is given
directly, but the alphabetical values
from A to F (values 58 to 62) would
actually produce various punctuation
symbols i f CHRS was to be applied
at this point. These values need to be
raised to render values o f 65 to  70
which will give CH RS characters A to
F.
150 T=T+48: IF T >57 THEN T=T+7
160 RETURN
If the program is tested i t  will
actually work. If a problem did arise,
it would be easier to locate the seat
of the problem thanks to  the pre-
programming planning stages,

Extending Basic
C
as inadequate as you can get.
Many commands which other
8-bit home computers take for granted
are missing, like CLS (clear the screen).
AT (set print position to line x, column
y), and GOTO variable, which allows
you to  deﬁne a  line number as a
variable - to mention but a few.
But worst of all, Commodore Basic
does not support any of the advanced
graphic and sound features of the C64.
If you are an avid programmer in
Basic, you might be forgiven for never
having come across any of the more
advanced features o f your computer
- unless, that is, you go into heavy
poking and write lots of subroutines
in machine code.
The purpsose o f  this series o f
articles is to show you how you can
soup up Commodore Basic in any way
you like according to your personal
needs. This is not yet another series
of extended BASIC routines you just
type in and use. Instead you should
be encouraged to develop your own
extended routines - the examples given
are meant only as illustrations to help
you develop your own ideas.
Since extended Basic routines have
to be written in machine code, (they'd
be impractical otherwise) you'll need
some grounding i n  assembler pro-
gramming, as given in my recent Your
Commodore series. Byling Into the
6510. I n  a  w a y this series i s a
continuation of Byting Into the 6510
because it should also teach you a lot
more about assembler programming,
especially about making use o f the
many ROM-routines of the CM.
Driving a Wedge
In order to make the C64 accept and
execute y o u r  o w n  e xte n d e d
commands, ﬁrst you have to intercept
the normal ﬂow of Basic at one point
in the ROM. This is called "driving
a wedge". A  wedge is a routine that
interrupts the normal ﬂow of a ROM-
PROGRAMMING

routines

routine, and makes the computer jump
to a routine written by you instead of
the normal routine written in ROM.
But how can you drive a wedge
if you can't write to  ROM? The
developers o f the C64, who wanted
their machine to  be as ﬂexible as
possible, thought o f this. The most
important routines both in the Basic-
ROM and the Kernal-ROM are
accessed via vectors, and these vectors
are i n  R A M ,  where they can be
changed.
A vector points to the start address
of a certain routine. Instead ofjumping
straight to the beginning of the routine,
the computer gets the start address for
the routine from the vector location
(indirect addressing), and then jumps
to that address.
The most important vectors of the
C64 are at location $0300 to $03313.
Since all these vectors are in RAM,
they all can be changed! For example,
location $0302 normally points a t
SA483. This is the so-called "BASIC
Warm Start", which is entered either
after a  direct command has been
executed o r  a  Basic line has been
entered into the Basic textﬁle.
It starts by waiting for the return
key to be pressed. Then the line on
the screen is entered into what is called
the "input buffer". Next, if the line has
no number, it is executed straight away
as a direct Basic command or, if it has
a line number, the line is entered into
the Basic textﬁle. Then the computer
jumps back to  the warm start. But
every time it goes via the indirect jump
in locations $A480, and this indirect
jump uses the vector at $0302. I f  it
hasn't been changed, the computer
jumps to  SA483, the start o f  the
routine. I f  it has been changed, the
computer jumps to whatever routine
the $0302 vector is pointing at.
You could therefore intercept the
normal Basic ﬂow at this point. But
since you want to introduce new Basic
commands, there is a better point. We
intercept Basic just before a  Basic
YOUR COMMODORE february 1989

statement is executed by the computer.
This is done via the vector at $0308
- normally this vector points at SA7E4.
Executing a Basic command
The routine at $A7E4 starts with the
Basic line to be executed being stored
in the input buffer ($0200-$02FF).
Furthermore, all Basic commands
have already been tokenised. This
means that, i f the ﬁrst character the
computer gets from the input buffer
is larger than $80 (decimal 128), the
computer knows that it has to be a
Basic command. Otherwise it's part of
a parameter, that i s a  number, a
variable or a string.
The routine starts by getting that
character from the input buffer and
evaluating it. For this it uses a very
important routine which is written into
the zero page at location S73 when-
ever the computer is started up. This
is called "CH ARGET" and works like
this:
First the pointer which points at
the address in the input buffer, where
the next character is, is incremented
by one. Then the character is fetched
from that position and put into the
accumulator. Finally the routine does
a number of tests which set the zero-
ﬂag and the carry-ﬂag according to the
nature of the character. If it's a letter,
carry is cleared, and i f the number is
zero, which is always used as an end
marker by the computer, the zero-ﬂag
is set.
CHARGET is a very clever piece
of programming, because every time
the routine is used i t modiﬁes itself
(this is why it is in RAM and not in
ROM as most other routines o f the
operating system). Figure 1 shows the
CHARGET routine. It's an excellent
example of efﬁcient machine code pro-
gramming, and because of this worth
studying thoroughly.
First the location pointer in $7A
is incremented (lines 10-30). Since $7A
is at the same time part of C H A RGET

instruction in line 40), it's always auto-

Notice that CHARGET ignores all
5paces (lines 70 and 80). I f  it comes
across a space it simply jumps back
to the beginning of the routine. This
allows you to use as many spaces in-
between Basic statement as you like,
or else you can type a direct Basic
command a t the other end o f  line
which will still be recognized and
executed properly.
After the current character has
been fetched b y  the C H AR GET
routine, th e  execute-a-statement
routine jumps to a subroutine which
ﬁnds out i f it is a BASIC command
or not. I f  yes, that is i f the value is
larger than $80, the computer jumps
with the help of the token code to the
appropriate routine, which then
executes the command itself. This is
done by subtracting $SO or decimal 128
from the token code. The result gives
the position in the table of tokenised
commands, and this in turn gives the
address o f  the routine where the
command is executed. Otherwise the
following characters are being dealt
with as the parameters o f  a  L E T
command or, it's a colon, the next
character is fetched.
Figure 2 gives you a disassembly
of the routine which takes the token
code (-128), and makes the computer
jump to the right routine. One way
of doing this might be by writing a
routine like this:
LDA tokenvalue-I 28
CM P 
1
BEQ Routine I
CM P 
2
BEQ Routine 2
etc.
This is o f course a  pretty long-
winded way of doing it, and the routine
uses a lot of memory space. Instead
the jump is calculated by ﬁrst multi-
plying the token value by two. This
is done because every address has a
low byte and a high byte.
The doubling up o f the value is

done in machine code simply by using
the ASL instruction, which shifts the
bits of the register or memory location
one bit to the left. The result is that
the overall value of the byte is doubled.
Next, this value is transferred into the
Y-register, which is then used as the
index.
The jump table o f  Commodore
Basic commands starts a t SAO0C,
which is pretty much at the beginning
of BASIC ROM. First of all, the two
jump address (high and low) bytes
must be found by using an indexed
load. Then, the high byte of the jump
address is pushed onto the stack. Then
the low byte of the address is calcu-
lated in the same way, and this too
is also pushed onto the stack.
Now, th i s  address h a s been
registered as a return address of a sub-
routine on the machine stack. That is,
the next time an RTS instruction is
executed, the computer pulls that
address automatically from the stack
and jumps to it.
The routine ends by jumping to the
CHARGET routine in order to get the
ﬁrst character o f the possible para-
meters of the Basic command. Since
CHARGET ends with an RTS instruc-
tion, the result is that the computer
jumps to the command routine itself,
because it will pull the address we have
just stored on the stack and use it as
the return address.
A p re tty neat piece o f  p ro -
gramming, isn't it! You can use this
method in several ways in your own
programming, for example by using
the ASCII-values of the ﬁrst letters of
a table of commands or subroutines.
Main Program
List 1 contains our program, which
drives a wedge into ROM before a
statement is executed, and executes
two Basic commands of our own. First
the vector at $0308 is changed so that
the computer jumps to our routine
instead of the usual one at $A7E4 (lines
120-170). The next routine changes the
vector back to normal (lines 250-300).
This effectively switches our extended
Basic commands off, so that we will
get the usual syntax error report
should we use them.
Then comes the wedge itself. To
start the ball rolling I have chosen two
new commands: OFF and BORDER.
The ﬁrst one simply swilches extended
Basic off, by calling on the routine in
lines 250-300. Y o u  activate o u r
extended Basic by giving the direct
PR O G R A MMIN G
command: SYS 49152, and you switch
it o ff by giving our new command
OFF.
The second command, BORDER,
lets you change the border colour of
the screen with a BASIC command.
The syntax is: BORDER n, whereby
n is a number between 0 (black) and
15 (light grey). Once you've got the
hang o f how the routine works. I'm
sure you won't have any problems
adding two further commands which
allow you to change the ink and the
paper colour.
Incidentally, these two new Basic
commands (as well as the others we'll
introduce in future) can be executed
as direct commands, as well as
included i n  programs! Bu t i f  you
include them in a program you'll ﬁrst
have to load and activate our extended
Basic. Otherwise you will get one
syntax error report after the other,
because the computer won't recognize
any of the new commands.
The idea o f our main routine is
really very simple: the next character
is fetched with the CH ARGET routine
(line 380), and then compared ﬁrst
with the "0 ”  from OFF and then, i f
it doesn't match, with the "B" from
BORDER. I f  it doesn't match with
that either, the program ﬂow returns
back to  the normal ROM-routine,
which is then executed as i f nothing
had happened.
If it matches with the "0 ", then
the program jumps forward to  lines
760-810. The next character is then
fetched and compared with the ﬁrst
from OFF. I f  that matches, our
command OFF has been given; if not,
the program jumps to "normal", that
is the normal ROM-routine.
Line 850 executes the command
OFF itself, simply by calling on the
EXTBASOFF routine in lines 250--
300. Finally the next character is
fetched, and the program jumps back
to the ROM-routine at SA7AE. Our
command BORDER is being dealt
with in a similar way: ﬁrst the program
checks that the command has been
given (lines 420-500). I f  yes, i t  i s
executed, otherwise the program
returns to normal.
Notice that in line 450, I compare
with $B0 instead o f comparing with
the letter "0 ", as you might expect.
The reason for this is that OR is a
command o f Commodore Basic and
is therefore tokenised into SBO. That
is, when the word "BORDER" is put
into the input buffer, the "OR" which
is contained in it is tokenized into $130,
YOUR COMMODORE february 1989
52
because at this point the computer has
no way of knowing that BORDER is
a new command. You have to be aware
of this with any new Basic command
you give. If the name of the command
contains the name o f a Commodore
Basic command, then that command
will be tokenised.
Furthermore, there's one limi-
tation in the new command names you
can choose: your new Basic command
mustn't start with a Commodore Basic
command. I f  i t does, only yo u r
command will be executed, but not the
Commodore Basic command.
For example a  new command
PRINTER (to turn on the printer),
would disable the normal command
PRINT from being executed. There is
a way to overcome this limitation, but
it would be rather complicated and not
really worth it, since there are enough
words which d o  not start with a
Commodore Basic command.
Getting a Parameter
Our BORDER command would not
be much good without a parameter
which gives the colour code itself -
lines 610 and 620 get that parameter.
First the next character is fetched into
the accumulator with CHARGET.
Then we call a ROM-routine, which
gets a  series o f  ASC II numerical
characters and converts them into low
byte/ high byte binary-decimal. The
result is stored in the system variables
$14 (low) and $15 high.
This routine has been designed to
convert the line numbers from their
ASCII-form into binary-decimal as
they appear on screen. It can only deal
with integers in the range from 00-
63999. In line 660 I get the low byte
from $14 (of course the high byte in
$15 is of no interest in this case to
us) and load it into the location 53280,
which changes the border colour.
Notice that I use the X-register for
this, and not the accumulator. This is
because I want to keep the character
in the accumulator, since I'll need it
for when I return to the ROM-routine
at SA7AE.
Finally
When you tr y  out the BORDER
command, you will notice that i t
doesn't work with variables. In  the
next article we will overcome this limi-
tation and introduce a  COLOUR
command which will change border,
paper and ink colour all in one go.

Profrssional Print quality on a PlusI4? Paul Eves takes
a look at Y ER's latest utility.
•
In these days of the Amiga, CI 28 and
CM, it is a refreshing change to see
that someone has not forgotten the
poor old +4. Print Enhancer, from
York Electronic Research, i s a n
excellent +4 program, used primarily
with the MPS801 and 1525 printers.
Unlike the Printer IV Rom chip which
I reviewed last year, this program is
software dependent. This has obvious
disadvantages, mainly speed of use and
accessibility. B u t the advantages
outweigh these. Fo r example, fonts
can be changed midway through a line,
and the user can design their own
fonts. Other options are also available.
So what exactly is Print Enhancer?
Basically, the program enables you to
produce impressive letters a n d
documents with true descenders. You
can use custom-designed fonts, o r
select from a choice of 15 inbuilt ones.
The program supports proportional
spacing, underlining, superscripting
and subscripting. The program may be
used in one o f three ways: with the
3+1 inbuilt word processor, the Script+
cartridge or through a Basic program.
Once the program is loaded and
running, there are four fonts o f 96
characters resident in memory. These
fonts are in four separate banks, which
can be switched in and out at will using
special codes. More fonts may be
loaded in as and when required. This
aspect of the ﬂexibility of the program
is what i n  my opinion makes this
program stand out. It means that you
are no longer restricted to  just one
typeface. Thus, your documents o r
letters take on a  more professional
aspect. A selection of the special codes
are shown below. Each code i s
preceeded by a command character,
and these command characters vary
from 3+1, Script plus and basic. The
command characters are CHR$(222),
Escape C H  R$(27) and CHRS(27)
respectively.
0 - Selects character set bank 0
I - Selects character set bank I
2 - Selects character set bank 2
3 - Selects character set bank 3
(These commands should be used
within, or at the end of a line)
4 - Turns on/ off underlining
5 - Turns on/ off justiﬁcation
6 - Loads named character set (Wild-
cards may be used)
7 - Set single line spacing
8 - Sets one and a half line spacing
9 - Sets double line spacing
(Commands 5 - 9 should be on a line
of their own)
Therefore the statement: P R IN T

would load the ﬁle named italic into

Although to get the full beneﬁt of Print
Enhancer a  few special commands
need to be learnt. Thankfully though,
YER have made these as few as
possible. Therefore I feel that once you
have used the program a couple o f
times, you will know all you need,
without having to constantly look up
the manual.
Finally, we come to  the fo n t
designer. Like the rest of the program,
the designer is straightforward to use,
with only a few keys to remember.
Once you have designed your own
font(s), these are saved for use later.
You may then mix your own fonts with
those supplied.
The keys used within the designer are
as follows:-
Escape to get into edit mode. + and
- for setting or erasing points. Space
bar for selecting a character to edit.
The Eleys I through 6.
All in all I was impressed with this
program. Good +4 utility programs are
hard to ﬁnd these days. Above are a
couple o f  examples o f  Print En -
hancer's capabilities.

A
status lines to update the user,
telling him" her to carry out a
particular action. There are times
when you would like to include this
type of message in your own programs.
To do this you could set aside the top
or bottom lines of the screen (by using
interrupts), use multiple screens or a
string of control codes to place your
message on the screen. The window
Facility of the Cl28 could also be used.
However, these techniques have their
disadvantages. Normally a status line
is just that, a  line! Using separate
screens to inform the user to insert a
disk i n to  the drive seems rather
wasteful. The other methods involve
overwriting existing text or reducing
the number of lines on the screen.
The 80 column video chip offers
another solution.
Register number six o f the VDC
contains the number of lines that are
to b e  represented o n  the screen,
and changing this number allows more
than the normal 25 lines to be shown
(or less than 25 for that matter). The
number of lines displayed is dependent
on the quality o f the monitor used.
I use a  Commodore 1900M green
screen monitor and I found that I can
display up to ﬁve extra lines without
any problems.
C128 PROGRAM d i
Getting it in
28 Line
Screen
Extra lines on your 80 column display
The program presented here allows
you to type in up to 25 messages of
one, two or three lines (ie. 80, 160 or
240 characters in length) that you can
then print to the extra lines on the
screen with ease from within your own
programs.
The Basic program presented here
produces a machine code routine made
up of three parts, a routine for writing
the messages, a table of pointers and
thirdly the messages themselves, stored
as upper/ lower case. This is all stored
from $1300 to  $1BFF and once
assembled it can be called from either
Basic or machine code.
The machine code routine fo r
writing to  the VDC is stored from
$1300 to S I3BC. Immediately after this
there are 100 bytes set aside fo r
pointers. Each message requires four
pointers, two for the address o f the
message and one byte each for the
length and the attributes (colour
ﬂashing etc.). This leaves just over 2000
bytes free for the text.
Accessing the VDC
The base address fo r the VD C  is
located at $D600 and i t has a total
of 37 registers. Unfortunately the VDC
cannot be accessed in the same way
as the VIC or SID chips, that is, the
various registers can't be POKEd or
PEEKed directly. All communication
between the outside world and the
VDC chip must take place through two
registers at $D600 and SD601. As a
result though, any program that uses
the VDC is by necessity fairly compli-
cated.
When writing to a register in the
VDC, the register number is placed in
$D600 and the new value fo r the
register is placed in $13601. If you wish
to read the value o f a register, the
number o f the register is placed i n
$D600 and the VDC returns the value
in $D601. The registers that this
program uses are:
Reg 6 Number of lines displayed.
Reg 7 The upper border of the screen.
Reg 18 H i  byte of address in VDC
to be manipulated.
Reg 19 low byte of Reg 18
Reg 20 Hi byte of the start address
of attribute memory.
Reg 30 Number o f  characters to
be written to address pointed to in Reg
18 and 19.
Reg 31 Data, the actual character
codes are written here.

How it works
There now follows an explanation of
the program for those interested in
how the routine works,
1000 -  Calls a subroutine to POKE
the machine code into memory, lines
2140-2250. The values are in hexade-
cimal, some readers may ﬁnd it easier
to use the inbuilt monitor to write this
part of the program, if so replace line
1930 with:
1930 FAST:COLOR6J:COLOR5,2: WIN-
DOW00,79,24,1P RINICHRS(14),CHRI 1)
and omit line 1940.
In addition the subroutine sets up
the variable names used and also
allows you to pick from one, two or
three extra lines in the display.
Note there is a KERNAL routine
to reset the VDC located at SE1DC
but this does not reset all the registers
to their default values. I  found i t
necessary to use the IOINIT routine
at $E109, unfortunately SID is also
reset and silenced!! CHRS(7) is the
'bell' and printing this gets SID feeling
like himself again.
Memory location SA2F in zero
page contains a pointer for the VDC
attribute RAM and normally contains
and eight.
Once the machine code has been
read and the screen is set up the extra
lines appear at the bottom of the screen
ﬁlled with reverse stars.
1010 to 1080 - Control loop calling
various subroutines. The loop term-
nates when 25 messages have been
entered or there is no space left. An
exit is also forced if "sq" is typed in.
1160 to 1310 - Subroutine to input
the message string. All alphanumeric
characters are accepted ie. UPPER
and lower case.
When editing your message only
the delete key can be used, cursor keys,
HOME, CLR etc. will not operate.
The subroutine will terminate when
RETURN is pressed or the number
of characters exceeds the limit for the
screen.
1240 to 1400 Subroutine to select
the attribute values. This routine
allows you to select the colour of the
message, whether it ﬂashes, is under-
lined or printed in reverse.
C128 P R OGR A M A
1480 to 1480 -  Subroutine to write_
message to memory.
1510 to 1610 -  Subroutine to display
message. The message is displayed as
typed in with the attributes selected.
At this point the attributes can be
changed o r the message can be re-
written. If the message is accepted then
pointers are updated and the next
message can be typed in.
1460 to 1790 - This subroutine displays
the number of bytes which are still free
for you to use.
1820 to 1830 - Subroutine for audio
warnings.
1860 to 1900 -  Subroutine for single
key press. Used for Yes/No answers
ky$(1) and ky$(2) are the keys to be
tested ie. "y" and "n" (or any other
two keys.). Once all of the messages
have been typed in or you run out of
space, the machine code, pointers and
messages are SAVEd on disk. The
program is SAVEd as MESSAGES
and overwrites any other program with
this name. You can of course change
this program to any name that you
wish.
Machine code program
Setting up the screen
This is done by entering:
QED
Once compiled, the machine code
program has three main entry points.
One to set up the screen, one to clear
the extra lines and the routine to print
the messages. Details on the three
routines follow:
SYS DEC("13B0") or JSR $13130 from
machine code.
the routine carries out the following:
I) Moves the attribute memory of the
VDC from $0800 to $1000.
If you look at the memory map of the
VDC you can see how this is possible.
$0000 - 507FF Screen RAM
$0800 W E F T '  Colour/ attribute
RAM
$1000 - $IFFE Free RAM
$2000 - $3FFT Character generator.
As you can see there is 4 K o f
memory available to the user without
interfering with the character sets.
2) Clear the extra lines
3) Move the top border of the screen
up
4) Display the extra lines
Clearing the extra lines
This is done with the command:
SYS DEC("I345") or JSR $1345 from
machine code.
Printing the messages
Printing of the messages requires that
you know the number of the message
that you want to print. The syntax for
this command is:
SYS DEC("I360"),N
where N is the message number (0-24).
If calling the routine from machine
code you must load the accumulator
with the message number before the
call ie.
LDA ; message number
JSR $1360 ; Call routine.
Note: Messages are numbered from 0
to 24 NOT I to 25.
On your own
Even though the program may at ﬁrst
sight seem a little complicated to use
you should get used to it after playing
around with it a few times. Using this
routine will help to give your C128
programs a professional quality that
is only usually seen i n commercial
programs.

running the basic line or typ-
ing SYS4109, instructions
will appear o n  the screen. A fte r
pressing an key the scoring table is
printed up. A t the beginning of the
game ie. after the instructions etc. the
timer will be printed in the top left
hand corner, this will show you how
much time is left, To spin the reels
you must have some plays in the plays
counter, this is achieved by pressing
key 'I' which can only be activated i f
you have some money left. Afte r
inserting the money you may get a
hold. This is shown by the hold keys
going a lighter red and the cancel key
going a lighter green. Pressing keys '1',
'2', or '3' will hold the desired reels.
If you hold the wrong reel pressing
'C' will cancel the holds allowing you
to rehold the desired reels. Pressing
'S* will spin the reels. If you get a win
you can gamble the winnings up to
200. Pressing 'C will gamble the winn-
ings while pressing 'S' will collect the
winnings. You may get a nudge and
this is detected by a clear 'white' noise

PLAYING
THE GAME
SUMMARY
Keys 'I', '2' or '3' operates reels 1,2
or 3 respectively.
Key 'N* is for selecting the nudge.
Key 'S' is to spin the reels or collect
the winnings.
Key 'C' is for cancel or gamble.
Key T is for insert.
GETTING IT IN
Go into monitor and type i n  the
following:
F 1000 4000 00
Then type in listing 1
Note. Holding all three wheels will
cause a delay o f approximately one
and a half seconds. This time delay
can be altered by poking the desired
delay i n  location $137A. 0  is the
slowest delay while I is the fastest. The
delays are in one ﬁftieth of a second.
ie: a delay of 100 is 2 seconds.
An alarm will sound once the timer
as decreased to 30 seconds, therefore
indicating that you have very little time
left.
TABLE 1

Routine
Programming
rogramming has more to  do
with wrestling than you may at
ﬁrst think. Basic can do a lot
of things, but it takes a lot of work
to get the wretched machine to do what
you want. Dreams of sprites zipping
across the screen to full three part
harmony accompaniment soon gives
way to hours of head banging and table
thumping as you grapple towards three
falls or a submission against a tough
opponent.
Treating each project as a  new
opponent sets up the correct mental
attitude. The ground rules are always
the same but the challenge lies in the
variety o f  ways that they can be
applied. Before starting, weigh up the
style of the program and decide which
routines may be useful. With this in
mind, it's always a good idea to build
up a library of subroutines which can
be introduced into a  new bout o f
programming. These are rather like the
a professional wrestler's specialist
moves, which can be called upon to
get a ﬁrm grip on the situation.
If a library o f routines could be
built up, they could then be pulled into
the computer from tape or disk to suit
the requirements of the program. In
an ideal situation, the routines would
be merged into memory, renumbered
and then the variables changed to suit
their new environment. The problem
is that the C64 lacks any merge,
renumber or change commands, which
does inhibit such a  grandiose plan.
Fortunately, i t is possible to merge
programs, but only if the Commodore
ﬁling system is altered.
The two principal ﬁle systems are
program and sequential. A  program
ﬁle is the normal ﬁle produced using
-
PROGRAMMING
the SAVE command. Sequential ﬁles
are more complex and, thankfully,
unnecessary for the subroutine loader.

no renumbering routine available, it
will be necessary to ensure that the line
numbers aren't duplicated i n  the
program or confusion will result.
The maximum value fo r a  line
number is 63999, so it is best to start
numbering subroutine lines fro m
60000. Each o f these mini-programs
should rarely need modiﬁcation, but
allowing a gap of three line numbers
between each program line should
leave room for any future changes or
variations.
Another convention that must be
adhered t o  i s standardisation o f
variables. It would be pointless to have
a vast library of routines i f it meant
that a series of variable swapping had
to take place every time a GOSUB
statement was executed. For example,
sound routines always access the SID
chip and graphics always use the VIC
chip, so setting up base variables o f
VIC=53248 and SID-754272 would
make a good start.
A subroutine library is much easier
to use from disk, but cassette based
systems can be set up i f careful note
is taken of the value of the tape counter
for each subroutine.
The ﬁn a l  problem i s  one o f
appending the subroutine onto the
program. To  make this as easy as
possible, a short subroutine loading
program needs to be loaded before
programming starts. This occupies the
ﬁrst ten program lines, and the new
program should always start at a line
value from 10 upwards.
How It W o r
Lines 0 and I allow the programmer
to decide whether a subroutine is going
to be loaded or i f the program is to
be tested. It uses the GET statement
so only a  single keypress will be
needed. To  indicate which keys are
valid, the ﬁrst letter of each word is
highlighted.

With such an input, never assume
that the user will press the unshifted
key. As you can see from line I, the
program uses the logical operator,
AND, to test which of the four possible
characters has been entered and if none
of these are pressed the line loops back
to get another keypress.
By the time line 2 is executed, AS
will contain one o f  four possible
characters, but initially the ﬁrst 16
locations on the screen are given a
foreground colour of blue. The reason
for this will become clear later. When
A$ is tested, the program jumps to line
9 i f the character is 'R' or a shifted
'R' and this is why the actual program
should start at line 10 or higher. Line
9 clears the screen and the variables
that have been used so that the real
program starts o f f  without a n y
declared variables w h i ch  co u l d
otherwise affect the way it runs.

If neither 'R' key is detected, the
program safely assumes that one of the
keys was pressed and the subroutine
loader asks for a ﬁlename. Pressing
the return key without typing anything
in, a null string entry, is treated as an
abort request. This is included in case
the loader is entered accidentally.
Cassette users who wish to  load a
program without entering a  name
should enter an asterisk at the ﬁlename

Location 186 is poked with the
device number 1 o r 8 depending on
whether tape or disk is being used.
The following lines set up the necessary
parameters for a relocated load. First,
the ﬁlename information is stored by
placing the ﬁlename length in 183.
Secondly, the high byte of the ﬁlename
location is stored in location 188 and
the low byte in 189. These values are
calculated from the position of the ﬁrst
letter of the ﬁlename, 1024 in this case,
and, to ﬁnd the high byte, this number
is divided by 256 to give 4 and the
remainder is the low byte. In this case
there is no remainder so the low byte
is zero.

The i f statement checks to see i f
an unnamed tape ﬁle is going to be
loaded. I f  this is true, the ﬁlename
length is reset to zero.
Location 184 holds the ﬁle number
and 185, the secondary address, is set
to zero to denote a relocated load. The
computer needs to know the address
of the relocated position. Obviously,
the subroutine is going to be added
to the end of the program in memory,
and the end location is stored i n
locations 45 and 46, low byte ﬁrst and
then high byte. The low byte is actually
two locations beyond the required load
position, hence the -2 in the equation.
The values obtained by peeking into
these locations are then poked into 195
and 196.

Before loading can commence, the
value o f zero is poked into 147 to
indicate a load rather than a verify
action. Calling SYS6263I executes the
load b u t  bypasses some o f  the
instructions which would upset the
values that have just been set.
Just in case the ﬁle doesn't exist,
a check on variable ST reveals a disk
load fault i f the value is not 64. A
similar check cannot be made on tape
loads so an ST value of zero is also
permitted.

When the ST cheek is successful,
the program jumps to a ROM routine
which d o e s  s o m e  i n t e r n a l
housekeeping on the program lines to
make sure that they all latch together
properly. Now that the program has
been lengthened, locations 45 and 46
need to be updated. The end-of-load
address is stored in 174 and 175 so
the peeked value from these is stored
into 45 and 46.
After this all that is left is an end
command to make sure that the loader
program doesn't run on to execute the
program under construction.
When a cassette load is terminated by
pressing the stop key, part o f  the
program will have been loaded and will
appear when the program is listed. At
this point the end of program pointers
will not have been reset, so a  new
subroutine can be safely loaded. It is
better not to abort a load and when
it ﬁnishes, the unwanted lines can be
deleted.
Disk u se rs w i l l  experience
problems if using a colon in the load
command, This will result i n  an
EXTRA I G N O R E D ?  message
appearing on the screen. To overcome
this, type the ﬁlename i n after an
opening quote mark (shift plus the 2
key).
Owners of fast-load cartridges may
ﬁnd that the loader only works at
normal speed because the program
jumps into the ROM and avoids the
load vector at 816/7. In  some cases
the fast load can be accessed b y
substituting P O K E 7 8 0 , 0  f o r
POKE147,0 in line 6 and changing the
SYS command t o  SYS62626. I
developed the routine using Dolphin
DOS and no changes are necessary to
access the fast loader in this case.
As a ﬁnal tip, keep the program
name down to ten characters so that
the starting line number can be
included. Fo r  example, an input
routine could be called "KEYPRESS
.60000"
Now all that is needed is a series
of subroutines so get working and
maybe send in any of which you are
particularly proud. We can't offer you
fortune but a certain amount of fame
will be afforded through the pages of
Your Commodore.

follow these simple rules then it will
make our job a lot easier,
I ) If possible all material sent to the
magazine should be typed or printed
out on a computer printer.
2) All text should be double spaced i.e.
there should be a blank line between
each line of text. You should also leave
a margin o f  about 1 0  characters
around the text.
3) On the very ﬁrst page you should
put the following:
Name of the article
Machine that it is for
Any' extras required - disk, printer
etc.

So you own a Commodore? So you've
written some programs? So why haven't you
sent them to us?
For example, suppose y o u  h a d
submitted an article on C64 interrupts.
You should put something like the
following at the head of the page:
I n terrupts/IS mit hi
5) Please make sure that you do not
make any additional marks on your
text especially underlining.
6) Try and write i n  clear concise
English, it does not have to be a work
of literature but it must be comprehen-
sible.
7) On the bottom o f each page you
should put the word MORE i f there
are more pages to the article or ENDS
if it is the last page,
8) I f  possible, enclose a listing of all
programs.
9) Under n o  circumstances use a
staple to hold the pages together. Use a
paperclip instead.
10) Programs should be included on
either disk or tape. Make sure that you
SAVE two copies of every program so
that we have a better chance of loading
them if problems occur.
11) Programs under 10 lines can be
included in the text. If your program is
longer than this you must enclose a
disk or cassette.
12) I f  your article needs any artwork
then supply clear examples of what is
needed. We don't expect you to be an
artist but we do need to see what is
required.

selves so don't worry about this too
much.
14) Submissions o f  any length are
welcome. If you have a live line routine
that you think may be o f  use t o
someone else we welcome it just as
much as a full blown six part series.
15) Payment varies quite a lot and de-
pends on quite a number of factors,
such a s  complexity o f  program,
presentation o f program, number of
magazine pages it takes up etc. Pay-
ment is generally between .E10.00 and
E.800.00.
16) Al l  payments are made i n  the
month that the magazine containing
your article has appeared in print.
17) If we do ﬁnd your submission
suitable for inclusion in the magazine
we will write to you giving the terms of
publication, the rate of payment and
an agreement form. Prompt return of
this form will allow us to use your
program as soon as possible.
18) I f  you want the program return-

mean a row of ten of these symbols.
[S+2] means hold down the shift

doesn't take a great leap of logic to
realise that [C-1-2] means exactly the
same thing except that the Commo-
dore key (bottom left of the keyboard)
is held down instead of the shift key.
If more than two spaces appear in a
statement then this will be printed as
[SPC4] o r , exceptionally, [SSPC4].
Translated into English this means
press the spacebar four times or in the
latter case hold the shift key down
while you do it.
A string of special characters could
appear as:
[CTRL N ,  DOWN2,LEFT5,BLUE,
F3,C.3]
This would be achieved by holding

for the C64.
down the CTRL key as you press N,
press the cursor key down twice, the
cursor left key ﬁve times, press the key
marked BLUE while holding down the
CTRL key, press the F3 key and.
ﬁnally hold the Commodore key down
while pressing the number two key (C2
would o f course make the computer
print in brown).
Always remember that you should
only have a row of graphics characters
on your screen with no square brackets
and no commas, unless something like
this appears:
[SS], K 1
In this case the two characters should
have a comma between them.
On rare occasions [REV 1 ] will
appear in a listing. This is a delete
symbol and is created by entering the
line up to this mnemonic. Then type a
closing quotation mark (SHIFT & 2)
and delete it. This gets the computer
out of quotes mode. Hold down CTRL
and press th e  number nine k e y
(RVSON), type the relevant number of
reversed T's and then hold down
CTRL and press zero (RVSOFF).
Next type another quotation mark and
delete it again. Now ﬁnish the line and
press RETURN.
A list of these special cases is given
in the table but remember that only
one o f these mnemonics will appear
outside of a PRINT string: the symbol
for pi. This may appear when its value
is needed in a calculation so this may
look something like:
YOUR COMMODORE february 1989
64
:CC=2*[PI1*R:
Ignore the square brackets and just
type i n  a  shifted upward pointing
arrow (ie. the pi symbol).

Checksum Program
The hexadecimal numbers appearing
in a column to the left of the listing
should n o t b e  typed i n  with the
program. These are merely checksum
values and are there to help you get
each line right. Don't worry i f you
don't understand th e  hexadecimal
system, as long as you can compare
two characters on the screen with the
corresponding two characters in the
magazine y o u  ca n  use  o u r  line

Type in the Checksum Program,
make sure that you've not made any
mistakes and save it to tape or disk

At the start of each programming
session, load Checksum and run it.
The screen will turn brown with yellow
characters and each time you type in a
line and press the RETURN key a
number will appear on the screen in
white. This should be the same as the
corresponding value in the magazine.
If the two values don't relate to one
another, you have not copied the line
exactly as printed so go back and check
each character carefully. When you
ﬁnd the error simply correct i t and

press RETURN again. •
If you want to turn off the checker
simply type SYS49152 and the screen
will return to the familiar blue colours.
You can then do whatever it was you
wanted to do and if this doesn't use the
area where Checksum lies you can go
back t o  i t  w i th  th e  same SYS

Sprite Library
In this month 's delve
into the library,
Mike Benn
discovers bird ﬂight
T
that rare and exotic bird, the
sprite. There arc six sequences
which can be joined together to make
up longer sequences: the bird is made
up o f a single sprite, so it's possible
to have a ﬂock of birds ﬂying around
the screen at one time.
Table (Bird Flight -
Multicolour)
AO-A4/ 160-164 Bird perched facing
right, takes off to ﬂy
A4-83,1164-179 Bird in ﬂight, facing
right
B3-B8/ 179-184 Bird turning to face
viewer
B8-C7/ 184-199 Bird ﬂying, facing
viewer
L IS T IN GS
C8-D 11200-209 Bird landing, facing
viewer
D2-DF/ 210-223 Bird approaching
From distance and turning to the right
Getting it all in
Type in the basic loader as published,
and remember - save it, don't run it,
or it will self-destruct and, possibly,
burst into ﬂames. Before running the
loader program, you'll need to reset
the computer and type in directly the
following:-
PO KE43,0: POKE44,64: POKE 16384,
0:NEW and press return.
This will trick the computer into
believing that the basic now starts at
$4000 instead o f $0801. Load in the
basic loader and run it; if error free,
the program will automatically save
itself as a block of data. If you reload
that data in the future, remember to
add a I after the device number. The
data is saved in the following location:
$2800-$37FF,
YOUR COMMODORE february 1989
87
The sprites run from 160 to 223
in a compromise to avoid the area
$2000 traditionally set aside for rede-
ﬁned character graphics, and to avoid
the need o f typing in line after line
of data.
If only one o r  two sprites are
required, then use this formula -
(Sprite block No.-160) *40 + 190 =
the data line number at which that
sprite block's data starts. Remember
to type in the following three lines of
data and alter the variable BL to the
number of data lines you have in your
ﬁnished program, less one.
The small basic program BIR D
FLT DISPLAY will variously animate
the sprites in both non-expanded and
expanded forms on the screen sim-
ultaneously. To  hold on any sprite,
enter the same number for Start and
End,
Any Sprite Editor program will
enable you to change and adapt the
individual sprites t o  y o u r  o w n
requirements.

Readers Problems
Though the Commodore 64 is one of
the w o r l d ' s  m o s t  p o p u l a r
microcomputers, i t  can b e  very
difﬁcult to ﬁnd speeciﬁc information
about your particular machine.
At the Your Commodore ofﬁce we
receive literally hundreds o f  letters
from you, our readers, on a wide range
of subjects ranging from the simple
'Can yo u  give me  the telephone
number for ...
'I'm trying to write a program that uses
a split screen. How do I do it?'
Unfortunately, the volume of mail
received has become so great that it
is impossible to answer every letter and
still mange to publish a magazine each
month.
For this reason we have felt i t
necessary to  produce a  number o f
guidelines fo r  getting information
from us.
1) We cannot guarantee to  answer
every letter sent to  the magazine.
Should i t  become apparent that a
number of readers are suffering from
the same problem, then we will reply
to the letter via the Letters page.
2) A new helpline has been set up. This
will be open fo r  your queries o n
Tuesday and Thursday afternoons
between 2.00pm and 4.00pm. We will
not be able to deal with your telephone
queries a t any other time. I f  our
technical adviser is not available when
you ring, then a message will be taken
3) If you are having problems with one
of our listings, can you please let us
know in writing. This will enable us
to see if a number of people are having
the same problem. When a common
problem becomes apparent with a
program, then a correction sheet will
be issued. Enclose a  self-addressed,
stamped envelope and we will send you
a copy of the correction sheet as soon
as it is available.
We are sorry that it has become
necessary to  instigate these rules.
However, we are sure that you will
agree with us that the more time that
we c a n  sp e n d  m a k i n g  Y o u r
Commodore the most informative
magazine around, the better.

Commodore Where Are You?
At the Your Commodore ofﬁce we are
repeatedly asked for the address and
telephone number o f  Commodore
U.K. Many people, after referring to
their computer manuals, believe them
to be based in Corby.
The Commodore plant at Corby
was closed down some time ago.
Reproduced here you will ﬁnd the
correct address for Commodore U.K.
We suggest that you write this
correct address in the front o f your

SPRITE CONTROLLER
The listing for the sprite controller has
somehow got slightly mixed up. Line
21728 should read;- D A T A  6 4 ,
a
114,64,114,64,114,64,110. The line
22216 should re a d  D A T A  3 2 ,
32,32,32,32,32,32,32 The rest o f the
listing is correct, although the lines are
out of sequence. This should not pre-
sent any problems though.
GTX COMPILER
The more eagle eyed amongst you will
have noticed that the gremlins have
been at it again. This time there were
two listings missing from the GTX
Compiler program. If you would like
copies o f these listings, then send a
large SAE to us at Bug ﬁnders and
we will send them by return.
Rug Finder
We'd like to remind our readers thai
we run a Bug Finder service.
If you have typed in one o f our
programs and despite much checking,
you still can't get it to run, then send us
the following:
Two copies of your program on tape
or disk.
A description of your problem.
If possible a listing of your work (you
may omit this).
A stamped, self-addressed envelope
for return of the program to you.
Should any of the above be missing
then we will not be able to deal with
your query.
We will try to point out where You
have made errors and place a corrected
copy of the program back on to your
tape or disk before we return it to you.
Do not send a program to us as
soon as it stops working, please check
it several times ﬁrst.
We d o  get a  large number o f
queries and so it may take a while for
us to deal with yours personally.
Note: we can only deal with problems
relating to programs published in Your
Commodore.
