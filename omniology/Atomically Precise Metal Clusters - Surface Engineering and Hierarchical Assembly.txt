Chemists have long been motivated to create atomically precise metal nanoclusters 
as model molecules to address fundamental issues and investigate the structure–
property relationship of conventional imprecise metal nanoparticles. A hot topic in 
metal cluster science is tailoring their structure and property through surface engi-
neering and supramolecular assembly, to access desired functions in catalysis, 
optics, and biomedicine. Given the breadth of the book, I reviewed various types of 
atomically precise nanoclusters. Due to space limitations, we must apologize to 
some colleagues for missing their excellent work, which could not be included in 
this book.
This book comprises 10 chapters, covering ligand engineering and assembly of 
coinage metal nanoclusters (Chapters 1–3), metal-oxo clusters (Chapters 4 and 10), 
metal chalcogenide clusters (Chapters 5–7), noble metal clusters (Chapter 9), and 
the semi-conductive Indium phosphide cluster (Chapter 8). Atomic level control in 
the synthesis, new types of structures, and the physical/chemical properties of nan-
oclusters are illustrated in various chapters. We expect this book to be suitable for 
graduate and undergraduate students, researchers, and industry practitioners.
Overall, the controlled modification and assembly of metal nanoclusters is 
expected to have a major impact on future nanoscience research and other areas. In 
future research, distinctive metal cluster-based function materials with precise 
structures will surely bring exciting opportunities in both fundamental research and 
practical applications.

1.1  ­Introduction
Monolayer-protected gold nanoclusters (NCs), with sizes in between simple com-
plexs and nanoparticles, are a class of newly emerging materials that possess dis-
crete energy levels and show intriguing photophysical and catalytic properties that 
benefit from the quantum confinement effect [1–3]. The well-defined structures 
reveal that such gold NCs usually adopt core–shell configuration. The ligand shell is 
found to have a significant impact on the geometrical structures, electronic struc-
tures, and properties of metal NCs except for their most primitive role in preventing 
aggregation [4]. Developing strategies to rationally modify the surface of the gold 
clusters, with the metal core maintained, is of great importance to achieve function-
alized metal nanomaterials and to reveal the surface impact on the properties of 
gold clusters.
What is more, beyond molecules, the condensed state of gold NCs, which is 
known as gold cluster-assembled materials (GCAM), supported by intermolecular 
interactions, is also attractive with new collective properties [5, 6]. For instance, 
intercluster aggregations induced by the addition of poor solvents, or cations to the 
solution of metal NCs, may display enhanced PL intensities – a phenomenon known 
as aggregation-induced emission (AIE) [7, 8]. As a common aggregated form, the 
solid-state metal cluster-assembled materials show promising applications in many 
fields (e.g. fluorescence, catalysis, chirality, magnetism, electrochemistry, etc.) [9], 
and their properties highly depend upon the packing modes and the intercluster 
interactions. The self-assembly of NCs is usually driven by hydrogen bonding,  
electrostatic interactions, van der Waals interactions (including dipolar, C–H···π, 
and π···π interactions), facilitated by the surface ligands between neighboring NCs, 
and, in some cases, the metallophilic and amphiphilic interactions [5, 6, 9, 10]. In 
recent years, the externally directed assembly of NCs by adding external reagents 
such as metal ions and bridging ligands has been explored [4].
In this chapter, we discuss the surface engineering and hierarchical assembly 
strategies usually employed to endow gold NCs with customized functionalities.

Given the limitation of space, only gold NCs with atom-precise structure and com-
position are summarized here. The potential applications of GCAMs in fields, 
including semiconductivity, magnetism, and biomedicine, are also introduced with 
attractive representatives.
1.2  ­Surface Modification of Gold NCs
The ligand shell of monolayer-protected gold NCs determines their solubility, stabil-
ity, and reactivity; thus, modification of the out shell may dramatically impact the 
inherent properties and enable functionalization of gold NCs for their use in bioim-
aging, catalysis, theranostics, and sensing applications. In this section, we introduce 
several well-developed strategies, including ligand exchange, post-modification, 
and surface locking by metals, for metal core-maintained surface modification of 
gold NCs.
1.2.1  Ligand Exchange
In nanoscience, ligand exchange is a highly versatile strategy for the functionaliza-
tion and tailoring of the surface properties of nanoparticles. In many cases, the 
ligand exchange would lead to size or structure transformation because of the high 
reactivity between metal NCs and the incoming ligands, the different binding modes 
of the ligands to metal atoms, and the poor stability of the target NC required to 
maintain the metal core structures. Thus, ligand exchange-induced size/structure 
transformation (LEIST) has become a new methodology to expand the “library” of 
monolayer-protected metal NCs for the exploration of their magic sizes, structures, 
properties, and applications [11]. In this section, we focus only on the metal core-
maintained examples of ligand exchange through the types of incoming ligands, 
which usually take place with ultrastable metal NCs such as Au8, Au13, Au25, Au38, 
and Au102.
1.2.1.1  Thiolate/Selenolate as Incoming Ligands
With respect to atomically precise NCs, thiolate ligand exchange process has been 
applied to introduce functionality to the NCs’ exterior ligand shell. Murray and cow-
orkers performed extensive work on ligand exchange on Au25(PET)18 with various SR 
(where PET = SCH2CH2Ph, R = Ph-CH3, Ph-F, etc.), and this Au25 NC can accom-
modate many different types of thiolate ligands, as evidenced in the observation of the 
Au25(SR)18-x(SR′)x series (where x can be up to 12) [12–14]. Pradeep and coworkers 
also performed ligand exchange on Au25(SG)18 with functionalized glutathione, with 
the purpose of tuning the optical properties of the Au25(SR)18 [15]. Furthermore, sele-
nolate for thiolate exchange was also reported in the Au25(SR)18 case by Negishi and 
Zhu groups, and the stability of the resultant Au25(SeR)18 was found to be enhanced [16, 
17]. Zhong et al. investigated the energetics of ligand exchange of thiolate-protected 
Au NCs with selenol and revealed that the formation of ­selenolate-protected Au NCs 
is thermodynamically favorable from ligand exchange reaction [18]. In regard to the 

1.2  ­Surface  Modificatio n of Gold  NC
3
characterization of mixed-ligand shell NC, Negishi and coworkers successfully 
achieved the isolation of each component of the mixed-ligand PdAu24(SR)18-x(SR′)x 
and Au25(SR)18-x(SR′)x series using HPLC [19]. And the mixed-thiolate ligand shell 
has also been observed by X-ray crystallography.
Heinecke et al. reported the partial ligand exchange of parabromobenzenethiol 
(p-BBT) onto the Au102(p-MBA)44 NC (p-MBA = para-mecaptobenzoic acid) [20]. 
When the feed ratio of p-BBT to the p-MBA on the cluster was kept at 2 : 44, partially 
exchanged Au102(p-MBA)40(p-BBT)4 resulted in very fast kinetics (e.g. in five min-
utes). The x-ray crystal structure shows that the exchanged thiolate positions were 
on the two poles of the fivefold symmetric dodecahedral kernel, which are the most 
accessible sites on the Au102 NC. A similar ligand exchange reaction was also per-
formed on Au25(PET)18 by the same group, and the partially ligand exchanged prod-
uct Au25(PET)16(p-BBT)2 was successfully crystallized [21]. It is worth noting that 
the mixed ligand shelled NCs could also be synthesized via direct reduction of gold 
salts in the presence of multiple types of ligands. For example, Yuan et al. reported 
a facile synthesis of mono-, bi-, and trithiolate-protected Au25(SR)x(SR″)y(SR‴)18-x-y 
NCs via a NaOH-mediated NaBH4 reduction method [22]. Ligand exchange has also 
been extensively employed to introduce chirality into the gold NCs by using chiral 
thiolate ligands. Bürgi and coworkers reported the use of a chiral bidentate thiol, 
(R)-BINAS (note: BINAS = 1,1′-binaphthyl-2,2′-dithiol), to perform ligand exchange 
with the racemic Au38(PET)24 NCs at room temperature, with a ratio of 
BINAS : Au38(PET)24 = 120 : 1 or BINAS : PET = 5 : 1 [23]. It was found that two 
PET ligands on the Au38 were exchanged by one (R)-BINAS, and further exchange 
with a second (R)-BNAS ligand showed a much slower rate. They also found that 
the (R)-BINAS had a preference for the left-handed Au38 cluster, manifested in a 
ligand exchange rate four times higher compared to that for the right-handed Au38 
cluster [24]. Lately, the same group investigated the electronic and stereospecific 
effects during LERs with achiral Au25(2-PET)18 NCs, depending on the enantiopure 
BINAS ligand and the corresponding fluorine-substituted molecule. The results 
indicate that the stereospecific effect is a local property at the surface of the cluster, 
whereas the electronic effect due to the adsorbed ligand extends over the whole 
cluster and significantly influences the kinetics of further LERs. This work offers 
new insight for the design of new ligands and a strategy to control LERs [25]. Very 
recently, Suzuki et al. isolated a series of mono-ligand exchanged Au25 cluster ani-
ons ([Au25(SR)17(SR′)]−) by employing porphyrinthiol derivatives as a bulky incom-
ing ligand (Figure  1.1). Through modification of the structures of the incoming 
porphyrin ligands, they revealed that the dominant factor in controlling the 
exchanged position of SR′ is the steric hindrance of an incoming ligand instead of 
the electronic effects. And the steric repulsion between the protecting ligands is also 
a critical factor for perturbing the core structure of the Au25 cluster anion as evi-
denced by the X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) analysis [26].
1.2.1.2  Alkynyl as Incoming Ligands
Synthesis of acetylide-protected metal clusters proceeds most often by the reduction 
of Au(I)-acetylide complexes  [27]. Gold-alkynyl NCs prepared by post-synthetic

acetylide exchange with intact metal skeletons, particularly those with precise crys-
tal structures, are very scarce.
The Konishi group achieved the regioselective introduction of two alkynyl ligands 
on the surface of the icosahedral Au13 skeleton by the ligand exchange reaction of a 
dichloro-substituted Au13 cluster cation [Au13(dppe)5Cl2]3+ [28]. The reaction cleanly 
proceeded by employing excess amounts of terminal alkynes and base (sodium 
methoxide), and the complete ligand exchange was verified by electrospray ioniza-
tion mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) analysis of the reaction mixture. Crystal structural 
analysis reveals that two alkynyl ligands in the obtained [Au13(dppe)5(C≡CPh)2]3+ 
are σ-coordinated to the two diagonal apexes of the icosahedron from the trans posi-
tions (Figure 1.2). The σ-coordination of alkynyl ligands to the gold cluster surface is 
much different from the binding interface found in larger gold–alkynyl clusters

synthesized by the reduction of gold(I) alkynyl precursors  [27], indicating the 
uniqueness of the post-synthetic ligand exchange method. This work also demon-
strated the presence of an electronic interaction of gold superatom with a σ-bonded 
π-system.
Notably, Hosier et  al. revealed acetylide-for-thiolate and thiolate-for-acetylide 
exchanges on gold NCs for the first time [29]. They reported the success or failure of 
exchange with different acetylide derivatives and/or reaction conditions and con-
cluded that forward exchange, reverse exchange, and interparticle ligand exchange 
are all facile reactions with suitable incoming ligands. With regard to acetylide- 
for-thiolate exchange, when phenylacetylene is introduced as a gold(I) or lithium 
phenylacetylide complex, exchange on thiolate-protected gold clusters is successful 
in mild conditions, whereas the reaction failed when employing free phenylacety-
lene under various conditions including ligand concentrations, temperatures, and 
the presence of an exogenous base.
1.2.1.3  N-Heterocyclic Carbenes (NHCs) as Incoming Ligands
Although diverse ligands including thiolate, alkynyl, phosphine have been employed 
to passivate the nanoscaled metal NCs and endow them with intriguing properties, the 
lack of other strongly bound ligands for NCs with different bonding modes has been a 
significant limitation in the field. In 2019, Narouz et al. first introduced N-heterocyclic 
carbenes (NHCs) to the phosphine-stabilized undecagold clusters by ligand exchange 
reaction, which feature a robust metal–carbon single bond and impart high stability to 
the corresponding gold cluster (Figure 1.3) [30]. Phosphine-stabilized clusters were 
chosen because NHC and phosphine ligands are both neutral and thus require no 
change in oxidation state or cluster charge to accompany an exchange reaction. The 
addition of a single NHC to gold NCs results in significantly improved stability and 
catalytic properties in the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2. By varying the conditions, 
nature, and number of equivalents of the NHC, predominantly or exclusively

monosubstituted NHC-functionalized clusters result. Clusters can also be obtained 
with up to five NHCs as a mixture of species. This work greatly encourages the investi-
gation of NHCs as protecting ligands, and a number of NHC-stabilized metal clusters 
with atom-precise crystal structures have been reported since then [31–39].
1.2.2  Surface Locking Through Coordination
The molecular flexibility is the main reason for the nonradiative relaxation and usu-
ally causes the luminescence quenching. With respect to the monolayer-protected 
metal NCs, the surface rigidity significantly influences their emission behaviors. 
The novel hexaauriomethane [(Ph3PAu)6C](BF4)2, first reported by Schmidbaur and 
coworkers emits green light in the solid state upon irradiation with UV light but is 
not emissive in solution at room temperature [40]. The nonradiative relaxation is 
probably attributed to the rotation of the outer Ph3P. To achieve the phosphores-
cence enhancement, it is necessary to close this nonradiative pathway by hindering 
the rotation of Au−P bonds. The Wang group reported a facile approach, that is, 
tying up the peripheral phoshines by introducing additional coordination, i.e. func-
tionalizing [(Ph3PAu)6C]2+ by using diphenylphoshpino-2-pyridine (dppy) in place 
of triphenylphosphine to form [Au6(C)(dppy)6](BF4)2, which is followed by install-
ing a silver atom, and thus the rigidity of the cluster is increased (Figure 1.4). The 
resulting novel heteronuclear gold(I)–silver(I) cluster [Au6Ag2(C)(dppy)6](BF4)4 is 
strongly emissive in solution at room temperature [41].
To achieve higher quantum yield (QY), it is desirable to fully protect the emissive 
core. To this end, the same group employed bis(2-pyridyl)phenylphosphine (PPhpy2) 
as the peripheral ligand [42]. Unlike dppy, which has only one pyridyl group, there 
are two pyridyl groups in PPhpy2, which offers one more coordinating donor for 
metal binding. More silver ions introduced into the cluster to limit the motion of the 
organic ligands may facilitate stronger luminophores. Using this strategy, they 
obtained the strong luminescent adducts [(C)(AuPPhpy2)6Ag4](BF4)6 and 
[(C)-(AuPPhpy2)6Ag6(CF3CO2)3](BF4)5 by rationally adding silver salts (Figure 1.5). 
It is of special interest that the latter NC emits very intense yellow light with a QY of 
92% in CH2Cl2/CH3OH (1 : 1, v : v) at room temperature.

1.2.3  Post-Assembly Surface Modification
Surface chemical reactions on atomically precise metal clusters have received con-
siderable attention for opening a new platform for cluster functionalization. 
Gunawardene et al. reported the direct synthesis of a surface-reactive gold NC plat-
form, which utilizes an azide-functionalized thiol ligand (HSCH2CH2-p-C6H4-N3) to 
give a surface-reactive [(CH3-(CH2)7)4N]-[Au25(SCH2CH2-p-C6H4-N3)18] (1-azido) 
[43]. To establish simple proof of concept cluster-surface strain-promoted alkyne-
azide cycloaddition (CS-SPAAC) reactivity of the platform, they reacted 1-azido 
with a symmetrical strained-cyclooctyne, which greatly aided the characterization 
of the modified platform. The results showed that all surface azide moieties are 
available for CSSPAAC while retaining the internal NC core configuration 
(Figure 1.6). Such post-assembly CS-SPAAC on the azide-functionalized [Au25(SR)18] 
platform provides an exciting new avenue toward the development of structurally 
and multifunctionally complex [Au25(SR)18] NCs, whose molecular-type physical 
and chemical properties can more easily be tuned for potential applications.

The Menshutkin SN2 reaction is a common method to obtain the quaternary 
ammonium salt ([−N(CH3)3]+) by reacting a tertiary amine with an alkylating 
agent. The Yonezawa group demonstrated the Menshutkin (methylation) reaction 
of the surface pyridyl (py) moieties on basic Au25(4-PyET)18 clusters (4-PyET  =   
−SCH2CH2Py) for their successful transformation into cationized Au25(4-PyET-
CH3
+)x(4-PyET)18-x clusters without altering their Au25 cores (Figure 1.7) [44]. By 
changing the methylating reagent, reaction time, and number of reaction cycles, 
they succeeded in controlling the number of methylated ligands (x); an x of approxi-
mately 18 (i.e. fully methylated Au25(4-PyET-CH3
+)18) was obtained under the 
­optimal condition. This work provides a novel idea for diversifying the R-groups of 
molecular metal clusters through the surface chemical reaction.
1.3  ­Gold Cluster-Assembled Materials (GCAMs)
Considerable interests in coordinated metal clusters in condensed states, namely 
“GCAM,” have recently developed [45]. Such condensed situations are expected to 
cause synergetic effects among multiple cluster molecules, which may lead to the 
emergence of unique properties that are not found in single clusters. By using coor-
dinated clusters with unique intrinsic properties and electronic structures such as 
the zero-dimensional precursory components, one can envision the strategical 
atomic-level design of cluster-based functional materials through controlled assem-
bling or chemical transformations (Figure 1.8). In this section, we only focus on the 
GCAMs based on atom-precise gold clusters linked by metal–metal bonds and cova-
lent bonds.

1.3.1  1D Cluster Arrays Bridged by Metal–Metal Bonds
In 2014, Maran and coworkers reported the structure of a neutral [Au25(SBu)18]0 
cluster (SBu = 1-butanethiolate), showing a unique 1D array in which Au25 clusters 
are connected via Au−Au bonds (Figure 1.9a) [46]. They mentioned that BT would 
be the optimal length to induce intercluster Au−Au bond formation because it is 
not so bulky and allows facile interdigitation between the ligands. The involvement 
of the interactions mediated by the C4 segments is supported by the comparison of

the crystal packing feature of [Au25(SEt)18]0 with less bulky thiolate (SEt = ethanethi-
olate), whose cluster components are not connected via Au−Au bond and are 
molecularly isolated from each other. The unique linear orientation of [Au25(SBu)18]0 
cluster in the crystalline state is likely associated with the absence of counterions, 
which may enable dense packing of clusters. They also developed a simple large-
scale method based on electro-crystallization for the preparation of the linear arrays 
of [Au25]0 from anionic [Au25]− cluster [48].
Recently, Zheng and coworkers reported an example of the linear arrangement of 
1-ethynyladamantane-protected (AuAg)34 clusters, in which each pair of the clus-
ters is bridged by one gold atom (Figure 1.9b) [47]. In the synthesis of the 1D cluster 
polymer, they found that the use of CH2Cl2 as the solvent for crystallization results 
in the formation of a linear array of (AuAg)34 clusters. On the other hand, the 
(AuAg)34 monomer was isolated in crystals when CH2Cl2 was replaced with CHCl3, 
indicating that the formation of the 1D array involves solvent-mediated processes.
1.3.2  Covalently Bridged Oligomers and Networks
Bridging between two or more metal clusters using multidentate ligands has been 
attempted in order to obtain insights into the interplay between two or more metal 
cores, which may give rise to unusual optical and electronic properties and bifunc-
tional catalytic effects. The ligand exchange method using bidentate ligands offers a 
straightforward approach, but it is not easy to elucidate the reaction pathway and 
mechanism. Also, their complicated dynamic equilibrium must be considered. 
Lahtinen and coworkers tackled this subject through both simulation and experi-
ments [49]. They used a monodisperse Au~250(p-MBA)n cluster as the starting mate-
rial and examined the oligomerization through the ligand exchange using five types 
of aryl dithiols as linkers.
For the separation of oligomers, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) was 
applied. Dimer, trimer, and tetramer of Au~250 clusters were successfully isolated, 
which were characterized by the TEM measurements. They further analyzed the 
relation between ligand-to-cluster ratio and the yields of oligomers from simula-
tions and showed that the yields strongly depend on the molar amount of the dithiol 
rather than the length/structure of the dithiol spacers. In addition, it was shown 
that the isolated oligomer fractions immediately began to re-equilibrate to afford 
new oligomer sets once they were dissolved in solution. These results provide 
important implications that the reversibility of the thiol exchange must be consid-
ered to assess the stabilities and properties of isolated cluster oligomers.
The ligand exchange reactions of Au25(SR)18-type clusters with various alkanedith-
iols have been also investigated. Dass and coworkers reported the exchange reaction 
of [Au25(PET)18]− and a series of linear alkanedithiols, showing that intramolecular 
crosslinking concomitantly occurs when the length of the alkyl spacer is short [50]. 
Aromatic p-conjugate systems have been also employed as the linkers to investigate 
the possibility of mediated electron coupling between two or several coordinated 
gold clusters. Bürgi and coworkers attempted the bridging of [Au25(SR)18]0 clusters 
using rigid conjugated aromatic dithiols (Figure  1.10)  [51]. Through the ligand

exchange reaction between monomeric 1-butanethiolate-­modified Au25 cluster and 
dithiols, they obtained several Au25 oligomers after the purification using SEC. The 
absorption spectra of the separated fractions containing oligomers showed a distinct 
absorption band at 840 nm that was not observed in the original Au25 monomer. It 
was also shown that this band disappeared to give a band at 690 nm characteristic of 
the Au25 monomer when the dithiol-bridged oligomers were treated with monothiol. 
Therefore, the newly appeared absorption band at 840 nm, observed in the fast- 
moving oligomer species, suggests electronic communication between the Au25 cores 
via p-conjugated aromatic linkers. Construction of such multi-cluster systems com-
bined with p-conjugated bridges is interesting but still in its early stages. Further 
research to reveal the mechanism and optimize the synthesis protocol is expected.
Until now, the only high-dimensional GCAM with an X-ray single crystal ­structure 
was reported by the Wang group in 2014 [52]. Firstly, by using (2-(3-methylpyrazinyl)-
diphenylphosphine) (mdppz) as protecting ligands, they prepared a cluster [(C)
(Au-mdppz)6](BF4)2, which bears six outward N donors that are available for coordi-
nation with metal ions in order to generate high-dimensional cluster-based polymers 
or frameworks (Figure 1.11a,b). Thus, the Au6 cluster can be seen as a metal cluster 
linker. The cluster linker connects silver(I) ions with the outward N donors of its 
pyrazinyl groups to form a luminescent cluster-based MOF, [(C)(Au-mdppz)6Ag6]
(BF4)8, with twofold interpenetrated NbO topology, and hexagonal channels with a 
size of about 1.1 nm along the c axis (Figure 1.11c,d). Of note, although there are six 
outward N donors for extending connections, the Au6 cluster only functions as a 
four-connected linker because of the terminal blocking of the silver ions by the H2O 
molecules and BF4
− counterions. The channels were available for solvent-molecule 
exchanges along with corresponding luminescence responses.
Of note, the assembly strategy through coordination has been employed by the 
Hyeon group. In 2021, they reported a highly fluorescent gold cluster assembly 
(GCA) with a QY of ∼90%, which is synthesized by introducing Zn2+ ions to none-
missive Au4(SRCOO−)4 clusters, by limiting the growth of gold precursor to oligo-
meric gold−thiolate ((AuI−SR)x) complex (Figure  1.12)  [53]. Briefly, monomeric

Au4(MHA)4 cluster was synthesized in an aqueous medium by adding excess mer-
captohexanoate (MHA, S-(CH2)5COO−) ligand to HAuCl4·3H2O solution. Then, 
Zn2+ ion is introduced to induce the assembly between monomeric Au4(MHA)4 
clusters without changing the original structure of the gold cluster. The mercap-
tohexanoic acid (MHA−H) acts as a protecting ligand as well as a mild reductant 
that reduces Au(III) to Au(I). The formation of GCA is induced by introducing 
metal ions into the solution of Au4(MHA)4 cluster because metal ions can guide the 
formation of the superstructure from monomeric building blocks. The Au4(MHA)4 
clusters are successfully assembled by the interaction between the anionic carboxy-
late group in the MHA ligand and Zn2+ ion in a cross-linking fashion.
The authors showed that unique aurophilic interaction between Au4 clusters is 
responsible for the radiative channel that is unprecedented for conventional gold 
NCs and nanoparticles. And the rigidified chemical environment, which was

induced by the coordination of Zn2+ ion with the carboxylate group in the ligand, to 
delay vibrational relaxation accounts for the bright greenish-blue fluorescence.
Recently, the Yam group constructed an unprecedented gold(I) cluster cage [Au24-
Cl]C with [(μ3-S)Au3]+ units as the nodes or vertices and V-shaped 1,3-bis 
(diphenylphosphino)benzene ligand with 2-phenyl substituent as the organic build-
ing block [54]. The complex cation of [Au24-Cl]C displays a cubic structure, where 
eight [(μ3-S)Au3]+ units occupy the vertices with the 12 diphosphine ligands span-
ning the edges of the cube. By virtue of the dynamic and reversible nature of the 
coordination bonds and aurophilic interactions, the gold(I) cluster cages exhibit 
interesting stimuli-responsive properties. A change of the counterions from Cl− to 
PF6
− or BF4
− resulted in a structural transformation from a cubic structure of [Au24-
PF6]C and [Au24-BF4]C to a rhombic prism structure of [Au24-PF6]RP and [Au24-
BF4]RP during the crystallization process, which could be recovered upon dissolution. 
The complex cations of [Au24-PF6]RP and [Au24-BF4]RP display rhombic prism 
­structures with two rhomboidal and four square faces, and the bidentate phosphine 
ligands occupy the 12 edges and are linked by eight [(μ3-S)Au3]+ vertices. 
Furthermore, upon heating the CD3CN solution of [Au24-PF6]C at 353 K for around 
0.5 hour, [Au18-PF6]TP was afforded, which displayed a triangular prism structure 
with six [(μ3-S)Au3]+ units occupying the vertices and nine ligands spanning the 
edges (Figure 1.13). The reverse transformation from [Au18-PF6]TP to [Au24-PF6]C 
could be realized in DMSO-d6, CD3CN, and acetone-d6 solutions at room tempera-
ture. This work suggests a new perspective to construct GCAMs by predesigning the 
ligands and cluster nodes with the desired geometry and configuration.
1.4  ­Applications
Directional modification and functionalization of gold NCs through surface engi-
neering could expand the potential applications of this kind of materials. On the 
other hand, besides the inherent properties of the individual metal clusters, the 
aggregation form of the gold NCs in GCAMs usually facilitates novel light, ­electricity, 
and magnetic behaviors that benefit from the unobstructed intercluster electronic 
communication.

1.4.1  Biomedical Application
The GCA based on Au4 clusters and Zn2+ can be disassembled and reassembled by the 
extraction and readdition of metal ions with the original structure of the Au4 cluster 
maintained during the disassembly process [53]. Both the controllability of the dis/
reassembly process and their structural similarity to metal–organic frameworks ena-
ble GCA to be applied as a biodegradable drug delivery system (DDS) that can be 
monitored by the distinct PL during its degradation and drug release. The representa-
tive anticancer drug, doxorubicin, was loaded into GCA to demonstrate its potential 
use as a trackable drug delivery vehicle. The hydrophobic doxorubicin can be success-
fully loaded inside GCA without changing the characteristic emission wavelength of 
GCA (Figure 1.14a). Gradual disassembly and drug release of drug-loaded GCA were 
confirmed by the decrease of PL and the increase of released drug in the solution 
(Figure 1.14a,b). Interestingly, the rate of drug release can be controlled by the rate of 
disassembly. The release rate of doxorubicin increases after 20 hours from the addition 
of the EDTA solution to the drug-loaded GCA. Cell viability analysis also confirms 
both the biocompatibility of GCA and its capability as a drug delivery vehicle, present-
ing efficient drug loading and release and sustaining the anticancer effect of doxoru-
bicin (Figure 1.14c). Finally, cell imaging by confocal fluorescence microscopy was 
conducted to evaluate the performance of ­doxorubicin-loaded GCA as the trackable 
and self-indicating DDS (Figure 1.14d,e). Time-dependent confocal microscopy shows 
the gradual release of doxorubicin in the HeLa cell (Figure 1.14d,e, red) simultane-
ously with the dimming fluorescence of GCA (Figure 1.14d,e, blue). These unique 
features of strong fluorescence, with narrow wavelength following the degradation/
disassembly status of the vehicle and release of the drug cargo, confirm the great 
potential of GCA as a trackable and degradable material, expanding theragnostic drug 
delivery in the future.

1.4.2  Semiconductivity
(AuAg)34n comprises polymeric chains parallel to the c-axis of the single crystal, 
and these chains with direct metal–metal bonds connecting the clusters are sepa-
rated in a- and b-directions by the bulky A-Adm ligands. This structural anisot-
ropy promises a highly anisotropic (semi)conductivity. To prove this, FET devices 
were fabricated to measure the direction-dependent conductivity of the polymer 
crystals (Figure  1.15a). All the field-effect transistors showed an anisotropy of 
electrical conductivity (Figure 1.15b). The averaged electrical conductivity along 
the c-crystallographic axis of the crystal at room temperature and relative humid-
ity of 56% is 1.49 × 10−5 S m−1, which is 1800 times the electrical conductivity along 
the a-­crystallographic axis.
The semiconductor properties of a single crystal along the c-crystallographic axis 
were studied with the transfer and output characteristic curves (Figure 1.15c,d).

The transfer curves show that at negative gate voltage (VG), the source-drain cur-
rents increase with more negative VG, demonstrating the p-type field effect. This 
indicates a hole conduction mechanism. The ON/OFF current ratio is around 4000, 
and the charge carrier mobility reaches 2.46 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 at source-drain volt-
age (VSD) = −16 V. The exponential behavior in the output curves is attributed to the 
Schottky barrier between the electrode and the polymer crystal. As a comparison, 
the reported photoconductive two-dimensional (2D) films of phosphine-thiolate-
stabilized Au25 clusters [55], showed an ON/OFF ratio of about 50 000 for VSD = 6 V, 
charge carrier mobility approaching 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 at VSD = 20 V, and n-type field 
effect. The mobility of the polymeric crystal (AuAg)34n is in the range of traditional 
p-type single-crystal organic semiconductors and close to the mobility of supercrys-
tal of CdSe quantum dots [56–58]. The conductivity (1.49 × 10−5 S m−1) of (AuAu)34n 
crystals in the c-crystallographic axis is one to three orders of magnitude higher 
than the values reported for thiolate-stabilized 1D assemblies of Au21 clusters where 
1D “nanofibrils” of the clusters were formed by modulating the weak interactions 
between the ligand layers of the clusters [59]. These comparisons indicate that the 
conductivity and charge carrier mobility are increased by several orders of magni-
tude in the macroscopic cluster-based materials via direct linking of the clusters by 
the –Ag–Au–Ag– chains in the cluster polymer crystal.
1.4.3  Magnetism
Au25(SBu)18
0 is a paramagnetic monolayer-protected cluster that, in solution, dis-
plays the same molecule-like behavior of other Au25 clusters. In the solid state, how-
ever, a linear polymer [Au25(SBu)18
0]n composed of Au25(SBu)18
0 units interconnected 
by single Au−Au bonds is formed. The otherwise unpaired electrons of the 
Au25(SBu)18
0 clusters pair up, with the generation of a nonmagnetic ground state [46].
To explain this magnetic behavior, the authors conducted DFT calculations and 
compared the relative energies of the magnetic state and the nonmagnetic state of 
[Au25(SBu)18
0]n. They found that in the crystal, the cluster has a nonmagnetic 
ground state that is lower in energy than the magnetic state by 27 meV. A nonmag-
netic ground state implies that the otherwise unpaired electron in the isolated 
Au25(SBu)18
0 cluster is paired up in the ground state of the Au25(SBu)18
0 crystal, 
leading to a fully occupied valence band (VB) and an empty conduction band (CB). 
Further studies indicated that the energetics of nonmagnetic versus magnetic states 
are closely related to the intercluster distance or the closest Au–Au contact. When 
there is no close contact between two neighboring Au25 clusters, the magnetic state 
is preferred. On the other hand, when close contact occurs, the nonmagnetic state 
can be lower in energy than the magnetic state. The conclusion was supported by 
the reference research on two known clusters, Au25(SEt)18
0 and Au25(SC2H4Ph)18
0.
The authors also studied the cw-EPR behavior of the [Au25(SBu)18
0]n crystals in 
comparison with the spectrum obtained for a glassy toluene solution. The very dif-
ferent line width and the absence of a fine structure at 3000–4000 G for polymer 
[Au25(SBu)18
0]n show that the physical state in which Au25(SBu)18
0 is studied mark-
edly affects the EPR signal. More specifically, the clusters in frozen solution display

the spectrum of distribution of randomly oriented S = 1/2 spin-state molecules with 
anisotropic g-tensor components. The temperature-dependent cw-EPR spectra of 
[Au25(SBu)18
0]n crystals and the estimated coupling energy (J) with the Hall expres-
sion revealed the fact that the double integrated EPR signal is an increasing function 
of T, indicating that thermal activation makes a higher energy magnetic state more 
populated, thereby confirming the DFT prediction that the ground state of 
[Au25(SBu)18
0]n is nonmagnetic. The best fit to the experimental data yields a J value 
of 28(2) meV, i.e. virtually identical to the DFT-calculated value of 27 meV. This 
outstanding agreement between EPR results and calculations thus provides compel-
ling evidence that the Au25(SBu)18
0 clusters self-organize into a linear S = 1/2 anti-
ferromagnetic polymer chain.
1.5  ­Conclusion
This chapter summarizes the surface engineering and hierarchical assembly of gold 
NCs with atom-precise composition and molecular structures. The surface modifi-
cation of gold NCs is sorted out in detail according to different strategies, while the 
GCAMs are categorized by types of intercluster interactions. We gave an outline of 
the crystal structures of some typical examples and analyzed the opportunities and 
challenges. Benefiting from the novel structure features of the individual/aggre-
gated metal cluster nodes, GCAMs show potential applications in many fields, 
including biomedicine, semiconductivity, and magnetism, to name a few. Several 
attractive representatives are introduced in the chapter.
In future work, new approaches to modify the ligand shell of gold NCs should be 
explored, which could conquer the shortcomings of gold NCs in specific applica-
tions. Controllable and designable GCAMs are desired in regard to the random 
assembly of hierarchical structures based on gold NCs. Also, the applications of 
gold-NC-based materials should be further pursued according to their functionality 
and advantages.

2.1  ­Introduction
Coinage-metal clusters possess rich photophysical and photochemical properties 
and great catalytic activity due to their unique size, geometric and electronic struc-
tures. A number of Cu, Ag, and Au clusters have been synthesized in the crystalline 
state and structurally identified by single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) analy-
sis [1–16]. After Au, Ag was an obvious candidate because of its low price, more 
chemically activity and shared similarities with Au  [9]. However, compared to 
extensive study of Au clusters, the research on silver clusters is relatively slow due 
to monolayer-protected Ag1+ and Ag0/1+ clusters usually show lack of sufficient sta-
bility and uncertain functional properties, which limit their wide application [1, 2]. 
To meet these challenges for silver clusters, different methods, including achieving 
a closed electronic shell [11, 12], alloying, doping for mixed-valence clusters, as well 
as modification and assembly, have been employed [14, 17]. A host of encouraging 
developments have been achieved in improving stability, tuning vis-NIR lumines-
cence at room temperature (RT), and in tailoring functionality of atomically precise 
Ag cluster-based materials [17, 18]. Therein, modification and assembly strategies 
demonstrated significant effectiveness and potential over the past decade, which 
not only could modify the shell configurations and components of discrete silver 
clusters but also hierarchically assemble silver clusters, producing novel cluster-
based functional materials with unexpected physical and chemical properties [9–11, 
13, 14, 18–21]. In this chapter, we briefly introduce the modification and assembly 
strategies for constructing novel functional silver clusters.
2.2  ­Precise Modification of Discrete Silver Clusters
With a nearly intact silver skeleton, the functionalized species are introduced to 
specially tuned shells at different levels of silver clusters. As a result, the stabiliza-
tion and/or improvement of the properties of silver clusters can be achieved.

2.2.1  Modification by Supramolecular Interactions
Noncovalent supramolecular interactions are extensively used to assemble supra-
molecular synthons or molecular building blocks into a diversity of functional 
supramolecular architectures [13]. Metal clusters serve as a type of unique macro-
molecule, whose protective ligands have various changeable pendent groups includ-
ing alkyl groups, aryl groups, dendrimer, borane, and pillararene, as well as 
DNA [22]. Tuning the compositions of ligand shell via the invasion of extra macro-
molecules or supramolecular building blocks to form the adducts, in which the 
invaders could combine the original ligand to cooperatively protect Agx skeleton. 
This has been developed as an effective method for the functionalization and stabi-
lization of silver clusters.
In this area, the most impressive cluster model is the [Ag29(BDT)12(TPP)4]3− (BDT =  
3-benzenedithiol, TPP = triphenylphosphine) cluster, which was first structurally 
characterized by Bakr’s group and where 29 Ag atoms with 8 free electrons are pro-
tected by bidentate S-containing ligands and the liable P-containing ligands [23]. 
This cluster has acted as an excellent model that was modified by cyclodextrins 
(CD) [24], cucurbit[n]uril (CB) [25], and fullerenes [26] to form new clusters, [Ag29
(BDT)12∩(CD)1−6]3−, [Ag29(LA)12∩(CB)1−3]3−, [Ag29(LA)12@(CD)1−3]3−, and [Ag29 
(BDT)12(C60/C70)1−4]3−, becoming members of Ag29(8e) family. [Ag29(BDT)12]∩ 
(CD)1−6
3− clusters were characterized by electron spray ionization mass spectrom-
etry (ESI MS). In this cluster type, six CDs were arranged on the cluster surface and 
encompassed BDT ligands, which could lead to structural isomers (Figure 2.1a) [24]. 
The molecular docking and DFT calculations showed that C−H···π interactions 
between BDTs and CDs, weak Ag⋯O interactions between the silver atoms and 
CDs, hydrogen bonding, and van der Waals (vdWs) interactions are the main impe-
tus for the supramolecular modification. Then, the authors showed the formation of 
supramolecular complexes of [Ag29(LA)12]3− (where LA is α-lipoic acid) with CB 
and CDs [25]. Formation of supramolecular complexes was confirmed using high-
resolution electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (HRESI MS) and nuclear 
magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Molecular docking and density functional 
theory (DFT) calculations supported the experimental results and showed that 
while CB formed inclusion complexes by encapsulation of one of the LA ligands of 
the cluster, CD formed supramolecular adducts by interaction with the cavity built 
by the ligands on the cluster surface. The complexation was favored by geometrical 
compatibility. Consequently, these superstructures are labeled as [Ag29(LA)12∩ 
(CB)1−3]3− and [Ag29(LA)12@(CD)1−3]3−, where ∩ and @ indicate inclusion complex 
and supramolecular adduct, respectively (Figure 2.1b). Moreover, such host–guest 
interactions resulted in enhanced luminescence of about 1.25 and 1.5 times for the 
modified system compared to the parent cluster, respectively.
This group also reported cluster−fullerene complexes, [Ag29(BDT)12(C60)1−4]3− 
and [Ag29(BDT)12(C70)1−4]3−. C60 invades the concave cavity that is encircled by each 
of three BDT ligands [26], which are driven by π···π interactions and C−H···π inter-
actions between fullerene molecules and BDT ligands, as well as ionic and vdW 
interactions between Ag and the negative charge density of fullerene molecules.

In addition, the extraneous fullerene could contact Ag atoms via η2 interactions at a 
6−5 bond of the fullerene. As a result, BDTs and the extraneous C60 jointly protect 
Ag29 skeleton. The adducts were also identified by ESI MS studies. The location of 
C60 in shells and the interactions are modeled and calculated by molecular docking 
and DFT calculations (Figure 2.1c).
2.2.2  Modification by Functionalizing and Protecting Ligand
2.2.2.1  Substitution of Labile Solvent Molecules
Labile solvent molecules such as acetonitrile that occupy ligand sites often cause 
instability in silver clusters, and they are also a synthetically useful handle that can 
be easily manipulated. The use of functional ligands with strong coordination abil-
ity to substitute solvent molecules at certain ligand sites is a very effective strategy 
for creating new clusters. This not only improves the stability under ambient condi-
tions or even at high temperatures but also tailors the properties, including optical 
absorption, luminescence, and temperature-dependent dual emission. This strategy 
has been widely used to create silver cluster-based frameworks (see Section 2.3.2).
Ag14(2e) series. Wang et al. prepared and characterized a 2e silver cluster, [Ag14 
(C2B10H10S2)6(CH3CN)8]·4CH3CN (abbreviated as Ag14-CH3CN) via contemporane-
ous self-reduction by the 1-thiol-o-carborane ligand [20]. The authors explained that 
carboranylmonothiol ligands are first oxidized to disulfide species by Ag+ ions. The 
subsequent rearrangement reaction occurred, eventually resulting in the formation 
of 1,2-dithiolate-o-carborane. They also characterized the intermediate disulfide 
compounds and 1,2-dithiolate-o-carborane in the reaction system. Ag14-CH3CN  
easily deteriorates even under ambient conditions. They utilized monodentate 
N-heteroaromatic ligands, including pyridine/p-methylpyridine, to replace the ver-
tex CH3CN and produce two additional new clusters, [Ag14(C2B10H10S2)6(pyridine)8] 
and [Ag14(C2B10H10S2)6(pmethyl-pyridine)8] (abbreviated as Ag14-Py and Ag14-Mpy, 
respectively), in which the cubic Ag14 skeleton remained constant with 2e valence 
electrons (Figure 2.2). This site-specific modification by coordination replacement 
with functional N-containing ligands increased the synthetic yield and enhanced

stability. Ag14-Py and Ag14-Mpy retain their crystallinity at 150  °C in air with 
improved emissive properties; both modified clusters display interesting ­temperature- 
dependent dual-emission peaks. This group also modified six mono-pyridyl ligands 
with different electronic effects (conjugation effect or induction effect) on the supera-
tomic Ag14-CH3CN cluster through in situ site-specific surface engineering, which 
achieved the purpose of regulating the charge-transfer path and luminescence cover-
age (from blue to red) [27].
In addition to substituting solvent molecules on the surface of clusters with pyri-
dine ligands, Zheng et al. also reported a case of substituting weakly coordinated 
DMF ligands with amino molecules (Figure 2.3). Herein, [Ag14(SPh(CF3)2)12(PPh3)4 
(DMF)4] (Ag14-DMF; DMF = N,N-dimethylformamide), with weakly coordinated 
DMF ligands on surface silver sites, was synthesized by a mixed-ligands strategy. 
Owing to the high surface reactivity of Ag14-DMF, the surface ligands are labile and 
easily dissociated or exchanged by other ligands. DFT calculations revealed that 
DMF ligands “on-off” on the silver sites change the electron structure of Ag14(2e) 
cluster, which further influences the optical properties. The best agreement to 
experiments is seen for dynamical ensemble of cluster structures which indicates 
the sensibility of the optical response to small deformations in structural symmetry 
of the cluster. When chiral amines (R/S-1-PPA) were introduced to as-prepared 
products, all eight surface ligands were replaced by amines, and the racemic Ag14(2e) 
clusters were converted to optically pure homochiral Ag14-R/S-1-PPA clusters, as 
evidenced by circular dichroism (CD) activity and SCXRD. This is not only the first 
report of enantioselective conversion of racemic mixtures to homochiral clusters 
exhibiting 100% optical purity but also opens the door for the synthesis of atomically 
precise chiral clusters using chiral amine ligands.
Ag(I)12 series. This is a family of Ag(I)12 clusters, each of which contains a dozen 
silver(I) 
atoms, 
with 
the 
general 
formula 
Ag12(SR)m(CF3COO)n(CH3CN)l, 
(R = naphthalen-2-yl-methane or tBu, 2(m + n) = 12, l = 4–6). A ligand-exchange strategy 
similar to that employing Ag14-CH3CN was applied to Ag12(SR)6(CF3CO2)6(CH3CN)6 
using pyridine-based mono-dentate ligands, including pyridine, 4-phenylpyridine, 
4-(1-naphthalenyl)-pyridine, 4-(9-anthracenyl)-pyridine, and 4-[4-(1,2,2-triphenylethenyl)
phenyl]-pyridine [29]. Consequently, this methodology yielded a series of transformed 
silver clusters with nearly unchanged cuboctahedral Ag(I)12 skeletons and different 
emission properties due to distinct emissive π-type ligands. 
2.2.2.2  Modulating Weakly Coordinated Non-S Auxiliary Ligands
Some weakly coordinated auxiliary ligands are often present in shells of silver clusters. 
For example, Ag78(36e) to Ag(I)20 series, in which weakly ligated P- or O-containing 
ligands jointly protected silver skeletons together with S ligands. They also provided 
excellent platforms for post-functionalization. Using custom functional ligands with 
larger size or rigidity, extra electrochemical activity, additional luminescence, and chi-
rality to replace them can obtain the desired stability and functionality.
Ag78(36e) series. Zheng et al. report the synthesis of an atomically precise race-
mic intrinsically chiral metal nanocluster [Ag78(DPPP)6(SR)42] (Ag78-DPPP) using 
a mixed ligand system [30], where DPPP is the achiral 1,3-bis(diphenyphosphino)

propane and SR = SPhCF3. The C−C−C bond angles of diphosphines constraint the 
rotational direction of the tetrahedral R3PAg(SR)3 moieties, thereby dictating the 
chirality of the nanoparticles. Using chiral diphosphines (BDPP  =  2,4-bis-
(diphenylphosphino)pentane) in place of achiral diphosphines, it was demonstrated 
that enantioselective synthesis of chiral nanoclusters [Ag78(R/S-BDPP)6(SR)42]+, 
namely, the enantiomeric pair Ag78-R/S-BDPP, can be accomplished with 100% 
optical purity and high yield in a one-pot synthesis. The chiral diphosphines give 
rise to, separately, two asymmetric surface coordination motifs composed of tetra-
hedral R3PAg(SR)3 moieties. The flexible nature of C−C−C angles between the two 
phosphorus atoms restricts the relative orientation of the tetrahedral R3PAg(SR)3 
moieties, thereby resulting in the enantiomeric selection of the intrinsic chiral 
metal core (Figure  2.4). This proof-of-concept strategy raises the prospect of

enantioselectively synthesizing optically pure, atomically precise chiral noble metal 
nanoclusters for specific applications.
Ag70(20e) series. Zang et  al. report a single-crystal structure of {NH2(CH3)2}2 
{Ag70S4(SiPr)24(CF3COO)20(DMF)3}·4DMF (Ag70-CF3COO) that contains enantio-
meric pairs of 70-nuclearity silver clusters with 20 free valence electrons, and each of 
these clusters is a doubly truncated tetrahedron with pseudo-T symmetry [31]. A 
deracemization method using a chiral metal precursor (replace CF3COOAg with 
R/S-TFLAg) not only stabilizes Ag70(20e) in solution but also enables monitoring of 
the gradual enlargement of the electronic CD responses and anisotropy factor gabs. 
The chiral crystals of {Ag70S4(SiPr)24(CF3COO)20−n(R/S-TFL)n}2− (Ag70-R/S-TFL) in 
space group P21 containing a pseudo-T symmetric enantiomeric NC show significant 
kernel-based and shell-based CD responses (Figure 2.5). The small symmetry break-
ing of Td symmetry arising from local distortion of Ag−S motifs and rotation of the 
apical Ag3 trigons results in large chiroptical responses. This work opens an avenue 
to construct chiral medium/large-sized NCs and nanoparticles, which are promising 
for asymmetric catalysis, nonlinear optics, chiral sensing, and biomedicine.
Ag29(8e) series. Khatun et  al. replaced triphenylphosphine (TPP) ligands in 
[Ag29(BDT)12(TPP)4]3− to achieve a quantum yield (QY) of 0.9% using other mono­
phosphines including tri(p-tolyl)phosphine (TTP), tris(4-fluorophenyl)phosphine 
(TFPP), and tris(4-­chlorophenyl)phosphine (TCPP), and diphosphines ligands 
including 1,1-bis(diphenylphosphino)methane (DPPM), 1,3-bis(diphenylphosphino)
propane (DPPP), and 1,2-bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane (DPPE) (Figure  2.6)  [32]. 
The absorption spectra of these ligand-exchanged clusters have only a small differ-
ence of 6 nm at ~446 nm peak, and no new absorption signal appeared, suggesting 
an unchanged silver skeleton. The long-chain phosphine ligands showed higher PL 
efficiency than those of the shorter ones, and the emission energy redshifted with 
the increasing chain length, resulting in regulation of emission maximum from 655 
to 715 nm. The photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) rose substantially from 
TPP to diphosphines (DPPM, DPPE, and DPPP) and reached a maximum of 27.5%

when DPPP was a constituent of the ligand shell. These results demonstrated that 
rigidifying the peripheral layer of the clusters favors the restriction of intramolecu-
lar rotation or motion of the outer ligands, which are important causes of non-­
radiative energy loss. Thus, the RT luminescence properties are increased from 0.9% 
to 27.5% by changing the phosphine-based shell layers. In addition, Kang et al. also 
examined the influence of amounts of TPP in solution on the luminescence inten-
sity of Ag29(8e) [33]. They found that the PL intensity was enhanced 13 folds with 
QY in the range of 0.9–11.7% in solution containing TPP. They ascribed this phe-
nomenon to restriction of dynamic TPP dissociation–aggregation in solution by the 
increase in TPP concentration. Therefore, the weakly coordinated P ligands of 
Ag29(8e) are similar to the weakly bonded solvent molecules, which easily dissociate 
from shells and result in instability or weakened luminescence. Their replacement 
by strong ligands could help to improve the original properties.
Ag(I)20 series. A weakly stable and barren silver cluster, namely (CO3)@
Ag20(StBu)10(NO3)8(DMAc)4, containing the weakly coordinating NO3
− ions and sol-
vent N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMAc), proved to be another important model for the 
functionalization of discrete silver clusters [34]. Zang’s group reacted this cluster with 
different functional carboxylate ligands [35], including benzoic acid, (C6H5COOH); 
2-(1,3-dioxobenzo[de]isoquinolin-2-yl)acetic acid, (C12H6O2NCH2COOH); and car-
boxyferrocene, (CpFeC5H4COOH). The transformed cluster (CO3)@Ag20(StBu)10 
(C12H6O2NCH2COO)8(CH3CN)4 (abbreviated as Ag20-alrestatin) showed green 
emission around 513 nm with a QY of 6.36% at RT; another transformed cluster

[(CO3)@Ag20(StBu)10(CpFeC5H4COO)8(CH3CN)4]·(CH3CN)(H2O)2 
(abbreviated 
as 
Ag20-CpFe) showed oxidation–reduction peaks from ferrocene moieties (Figure 2.7). 
The Ag(I)20 skeleton modified by amino acids (alanine, C2H4NH2COOH; valine, C4H8NH2 
COOH; and proline, C4H7NHCOOH) correspondingly displayed chiral optical activities. 
This laboratory subsequently used achiral luminescent sulfonic-group-containing ligands, 
4,4′-bis(2-sulfonatostyryl)biphenyl disodium salt (Na2CF351) and N,N′-di(ethanesulfonic 
acid)-3,4,9,10-perylene tetracarboxylic diimide (H2TauPDI) to further replace the residual 
NO3
− of (CO3)@Ag24(StBu)10(l/d-Proline)8(NO3)2·(NO3)2 [36]. This produced rare circu-
larly polarized luminescence (CPL) among known metal clusters and a large dissymmetry 
factor (|glum|) approaching 5*10−3. Therefore, the feeble O-containing ligands also func-
tion as a kind of operable site for custom functionalization (Figure 2.7). These results fully 
exemplified the versatility of the post-functionalization of silver clusters.
2.2.2.3  Replacing Coordinated S-containing Ligand by Other Functional 
S-containing Ligands
In this section, Ag44(18e), Ag29(8e), Ag14(2e), Ag(I)12, and Ag(I)6 are mainly intro-
duced as models. The replacement of thiolate ligands that serve as the primary 
ligands often greatly tunes optical absorption, solubility, and hydrophobicity. 
Besides, it also remarkably enhances stability and functionalities of the whole clus-
ter, including soaring PLQY, CPL, and hydrophobicity adjustment.
Ag44(18e) series. The single-crystal structure determination of ultra-stable 18e 
Na4[Ag44(p-MBA)30] with Aufbau shell filling |1S2|1P6|1D10| is a landmark for 
mixed-valence silver clusters or nanoparticles (NPs) [11]. The [Ag44(SR)30]4− cluster 
series displays remarkable multi-peak broad band and large cross-section absorptiv-
ity. Bakr’s group used thiolate ligands and changed the substituents on the benzene 
ring for thiolate-to-thiolate exchange with an unchanged metal skeleton 
(Figure 2.8) [18]. UV–vis optical absorption spectroscopy showed that [Ag44(SR)30]4− 
NPs retained all their molecule-like optical features. The Bakr’s group also discov-
ered that the cluster modified by 5-mercapto-2-nitrobenzoic acid (MNBA), 
Ag44(MNBA)30, is soluble in water, while those with 4-fluorothiophenol (4-FTP) eas-
ily dissolve in the organic phase (Figure  2.8a) and display a marked intensity 
enhancement of the emission peak at approximately 1300 nm. This is in contrast 
with the insoluble and non-emissive crystals of Na4[Ag44(p-MBA)30].
Ag29(8e) series. Khashab and coworkers used pillar[5]arene functionalized thi-
olate to prepare another Ag29(8e) cluster, i.e. Ag29(LA-P5)12(TPP)2, by direct synthe-
sis and ligand-exchange (Figure  2.9a)  [37]. The formula was determined by 
matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS), and 
the charge state of this cluster was not clearly stated. Unique changes in the optical 
properties were observed after introducing neutral alkylamine and cationic quater-
nary ammonium guest molecules to the AgNCs. While alkylamines produced a 
30-fold PL enhancement, quaternary ammonium molecules induced an extraordi-
nary ≈ 2000-fold PL enhancement that can be perceived by the naked eye. The 
authors reasoned that host–guest interactions strengthened the binding of LA-P5 to 
the metal and also perturbed the metal core, thus leading to drastic changes in

absorption and emission properties. Therefore, in this case, the joint modification of 
shells at different levels supported the enhancement of PLQY.
Ag14(2e) series. Yang et al. first structurally characterized a thiolate-protected 
Ag14(SC6H3F2)12(PPh3)8 (abbreviated as Ag14-DFBT/PPh3) (DFBT, HSC6H3F2  = 
3,4-difluoro-benzenethiol) in 2013 [38]. Ag14-DFBT/PPh3 emitted yellow light in 
solutions; however, the deterioration in several hours easily led to the loss of lumi-
nescence under ambient conditions. Ag14-DFBT/PPh3 in CH2Cl2 displayed two 
major absorption bands at 368 and 530 nm. However, the absorption spectrum of 
Ag14-S2dtc/py (Figure 2.9b) in DMF solution displayed a main band at 314 nm and 
a weak peak at ~378 nm. This observation showed that the ligand shell could effi-
ciently tune mixed-valence silver clusters and their corresponding optical properties.
Ag(I)12 series. Xu et  al. prepared a new cluster using naphthalen-2-yl- 
methanethiol (abbreviated as NYMT), namely Ag12(SCH2C10H7)6(CF3CO2)6 
(CH3CN)6 (abbreviated as Ag12-NYMT), in which the Ag12 skeleton could be con-
sidered as a three-layer Ag3–Ag6–Ag3 structure  [39]. Interestingly, Ag12-NYMT 
clusters interacted with six neighboring clusters through π⋯π stacking interaction 
between adjacent naphthyl ligands, with a centroid-to-centroid distance of 3.960 Å 
in the crystalline phase. As a result, Ag12-NYMT that is relatively stable displayed 
temperature-dependent dual-emission peaks and variable luminescence colors.

The high-energy emission peak at around 570 nm is related to NYMT ligands interact-
ing with each other via π⋯π interactions, with the low-energy peak at 660 nm originat-
ing from the intrinsic cluster (Figure 2.10a). This case showed that, dependent on the 
environment, efficient energy transfer between different excited states of silver clus-
ters could contribute to multiple emissions for various sensing applications.

Another model relates to Ag12-POSS (POSS representing polyhedral oligomeric 
silsesquioxane) dendritic complexes, including Ag12(SSi8O12C31H69)6(CF3COO)6 
(C4H8O)6 and Ag12(SSi8O12C31H69)6(CF3COO)6(C3H6O)2, in which HS-POSS has the 
chemical formula SSi8O12C31H70 [40]. These two clusters display reversible configu-
ration transformation, both of which are nearly non-emissive at RT (Figure 2.10b). 
Due to the inherent hydrophobicity of POSS and the distinct arrangement of POSS 
in the shell layer, the solid film matrix incorporating the two clusters showed slightly 
different hydrophobicity. The incorporation of silver clusters serving as building 
blocks in dendritic systems may be not only another effective strategy but could 
extend the range of applications of silver clusters in living systems, liquid-­crystalline 
materials, and some highly sensitive sensors.
Ag(I)6 series. Two early reported hexameric silver(I) clusters Ag6(dtc)6  
(dtc = di-n-propyldithiocarbamate, (n-C3H7)2NCS2
−) and Ag6(mtc)6 (mtc = di-n- 
propylmonothiorbamate, (n-C3H7)2NC(O)S−) with regular or distorted octahedral 
Ag(I)6 frameworks are only emissive at 77 K (Figure 2.11a) [4]. In 2020, Zang’s 
group investigated two enantiomeric silver clusters (abbreviated as l/d-Ag6(iptt)6 
and l/d-Ag6(pt)6), which are protected by (S)/(R)-4-isopropylthiazolidine-2-thione 
(iptt) and (S)-/(R)-4-phenylthiazolidine-2-thione (pt), respectively (Figure 2.11b,d), 
in which the Ag(I)6 skeleton deviates from normal regular octahedral struc-
ture  [19]. In stark contrast to non-emissive Ag6(dtc)6 and Ag6(mtc)6, solid-state 
l/d-Ag6(iptt)6 exhibits thermostability up to 150 °C and bright yellow light cen-
tered at 556 nm with Commission Internationale de l’Éclairage (CIE) coordinates 
of (0.41, 0.55) approaching the standard yellow YAG:Ce3+ phosphors and a maxi-
mum PLQY of 56% under ambient conditions. The authors assembled a prototype 
of a white light-emitting diode (WLED) (Figure 2.11c) by harnessing l/d-Ag6(iptt)6 
powder samples. The room-temperature emission maximum of l/d-Ag6(pt)6 
appeared at 575 nm, which could be excited by UV–vis light ranging from 300 to 
550 nm. Most strikingly, the PLQY of l/d-Ag6(pt)6 increased to 95% at RT, which is 
a significant breakthrough among precise silver clusters. Atomically precise struc-
tural determination combined with photophysical and computational analysis 
revealed that thermally activated delayed fluorescence (Fl), observed in silver clus-
ter systems, is responsible for the high PLQY. In addition, the two pairs of cluster 
enantiomers showed CD and CPL spectra with good mirror symmetry (Figure 2.11e) 
in dilute solution and solid-state phases, indicating the intrinsic chirality of the 
discrete cluster and the chiral arrangement of these chiral clusters in the crystal-
line state, respectively.
After the successful modification of silver clusters, one learnt that the strategy of 
ligand-shell engineering is applicable to both Ag1+ clusters and Ag0/1+ cluster. 
Through shell modification, these silver cluster models attained improved stability, 
significantly boosted QY, the tunable luminescence color, CPL activity, and the vari-
able solubility. Therefore, according to the characteristics of silver clusters, careful 
design of ligand shell holds great promise in expanding the applications of silver 
clusters.

2.3  ­Assembly of Silver Clusters into Atomically 
Precise Extended Structures
Silver clusters can also serve as nanosize building blocks with other specific func-
tional motifs to form periodic structures in crystalline materials. Based on shell 
engineering, the first important type of assembly method is based on intermolecular 
and inter-ion interactions or molecular recognition, in which groups of pendent 
ligands and counter-ionic moieties are used to assemble silver clusters [Ag70(28e), 
Ag44(18e), Ag30(6e), Ag29(8e)], producing new structures, enhancing stability, and 
improving properties within the assembled functional materials. Second, the coun-
terions could assemble these ionic clusters, such as Ag29(8e)3−, by electrostatic inter-
actions together with a diversity of supramolecular interactions. Third, appropriate 
use of bidentate or multidentate linkers to assemble silver clusters (Ag14(2e) and 
Ag(I)12) creates novel high-dimensional silver cluster-assembled framework materi-
als (SCAMs) or silver cluster-based metal–organic frameworks (SCC-MOFs). These 
SCAMs have pores of various sizes and shapes accompanied by a large number of 
accessible functional sites. The structures and functionalities of ensembles of silver 
clusters will be discussed in this section. 
2.3.1  Supramolecular Assembly of Silver Clusters
Ag70(28e) series. Zhu et al. disclose the synthesis and characterization of a new 
silver nanocluster, that is Ag70(SR)42(PPh3)5 (Ag70-TPP)  [41]. Directed by the 
ligands, Ag70-TPP nanoclusters undergo self-hierarchical assembly into a highly 
space-efficient complex secondary structure of a double helical 4H (DH4H) close 
packing pattern. The chirality of Ag70-TPP and the vdWs forces between the ligands 
are believed to drive its DH4H arrangement, and the observed interlocking of the 
phosphine ligands of adjacent Ag70-TPP nanoclusters also contributed. By chang-
ing the phosphine ligands on the nanoclusters, the complex DH4H packing mode 
can be transformed into a simple 2H assembly (Figure 2.12a). Multiple vdWs forces 
(C–H⋯π, π⋯π, and H⋯H) between Ag70 molecules are considered to be the key fac-
tor in maintaining the DH4H packing mode.
Ag44(18e) series. Landman and coworkers studied the crystal lattice of 
Na4Ag44(p-MBA)30 (Ag44-p-MBA), which showed molecular framework character-
istics, where about one-half of the volume is void. Using large-scale quantum-
mechanical simulations, they found that hydrogen bonds between bundled p-MBA 
ligands provide the most important cohesion [42]. Neighboring Ag44-p-MBA inter-
acts through a full hydrogen-bond network between the carboxyl (–COOH) groups 
of interfacing ligands. In essence, a total of 60 hydrogen bonds, including 24 intra-
layer and 36 interlayer interactions, consolidate the neighboring Ag44-p-MBA clus-
ters (Figure 2.12b). This strong hydrogen bonding scheme supports the mechanical 
response of the superlattice to hydrostatic compression. The crystalline clusters 
exhibited anomalous pressure softening and a compression-induced transition to a 
soft-solid phase. The authors proposed that the collective mechanical response of

the rigid molecular framework of Ag44-p-MBA is controlled largely by the compli-
ance of the protecting organic ligands.
Ag30(6e) series. Zang et al. reported the synthesis and structural characterization 
of racemic anisotropic nanocluster Ag30(C2B10H9S3)8DPPM6 (Ag30-S3dtc), which is 
protected by the mixed achiral ligands 8,9,12-trimercapto-1,2-closo-carborane 
(C2B10H12S3, S3dtc) and DPPM [43]. Single-crystal structure analysis revealed that 
the chirality of the nanocluster arises from the chiral arrangement of the ligands in 
the protective layer. The racemic nanoclusters all align in the same direction and 
pack into a hexagonal closest packed (hcp) superlattice. Interestingly, the racemic 
nanoclusters dissolved in DMAc underwent conglomerate crystallization to give a 
mixture of racemic conglomerates. More strikingly, in each single crystal, the homo-
chiral nanoclusters adopt a spontaneous helical assembly about a threefold screw 
axis. Viewing along the [001] direction, the superlattice contains a parallel array of 
helical tubes built with the nanoclusters in double helical arrangement, which is 
similar to the double-stranded DNA structure (Figure 2.13a). Furthermore, a multi-
tude of DMAc solvent molecules were located in between the nanoclusters in the 
reverse helices, which bridged the nanoclusters together through reinforced  
C−H⋯O bonds and H⋯H interactions. Of note, the DMAc molecules also adopt a 
4H double helical arrangement

helical arrangement consistent with the cluster-based helix. In contrast to the domi-
nant H⋯H vdW interactions in the crystal lattice of Ag30-S3dtc, the noncovalent 
interactions are more abundant in the helically organized superstructure, and these 
interactions, particularly the host–guest bonding, might be the driving force for 
helical packing instead of closest packing, which essentially leads to spontaneous 
self-resolution.
Ag29(8e) series. Pradeep’s group reported the co-assembly of Ag29(BDT)12 
(TPP)4
3− and dibenzo-18-crown-6 (DB18C6) molecules. The crystalline Ag29–DB18C6 
contained two entities, that is [Ag29(BDT)12(TPP)4][(DB18C6Na)3] and [Ag29(BDT)12 
(TPP)][(DB18C6Na)3], in which the DB18C6 occupied the interspace between silver 
clusters (Figure  2.13b)  [44]. The electrostatic interactions and intermolecular  
C–H⋯π interactions between DB18C6Na+ and the BDT and TPP ligands in the coor-
dination shell promoted the assembly and crystallization of the two building blocks. 
Consequently, the hierarchical assembly formed in their crystal lattice via supra-

luminescence intensity compared with that of the crystals of the original 
Ag29(BDT)12(TPP)4
3− cluster.
The assembly of silver clusters or silver clusters together with other heterogene-
ous building blocks of macromolecules into crystalline materials by supramolecular 
interactions could bring about new functionality as well as collective properties 
including luminescent switching and mechanical properties. 
2.3.2  Coordination Assembly of Silver Clusters
2.3.2.1  Inorganic Ion Linkers
Simple inorganic ions from the metal salts employed in the synthesis of silver clus-
ters usually act as co-protective agent in the ligand-shell, structure-directing tem-
plates inside the clusters, and counterions in the lattice, nevertheless, in some cases 
they also play roles as small bridges linking large clusters to form cluster-based poly-
meric materials, generating novel extension modes of silver clusters with tuned 
properties.
Ag29(8e) series. Wang and Zhu et  al. reported the hierarchical assembly of 
Ag29(BDT)12 clusters into linear chains [Cs3Ag29(BDT)12(DMF)x]2n (Ag29-Cs-1), 
2D  grid networks [Cs3Ag29(BDT)12(NMP)x]n, (Ag29-Cs-2; NMP = N-methyl-2-
pyrrolidone), and three-dimensional (3D) superstructures [Cs2Ag29(BDT)12(TMS)x]n 
(Ag29-Cs-3; TMS = tetramethylene sulfone) in which the Cs+ cations are surrounded 
by solvent ligand molecules (Figure 2.14) [45]. The interactions among the cluster

framework, the Cs+ cations, and the O-containing solvent molecules (including 
DMF, NMP, and TMS) assemble the anionic clusters into an extended structure in 
the crystalline phase. In Ag29-Cs-1, two adjacent Ag29 clusters are bridged by two 
Cs+ cations through Cs···C and Cs···π interactions. In addition, intercluster assem-
bly is induced by outward interactions from four Cs+ conjunction sites. For 
Ag29-Cs-2, each [Cs@Ag29(BDT)12(NMP)x]2 unit is adjacent to four identical units 
through four Cs+ conjunction sites, producing the two-dimensional grid network. 
For Ag29-Cs-3, each Ag29 cluster is surrounded by six adjacent cluster molecules, 
and each Cs+ cation links two clusters. This kind of ionic hierarchical assembly of 
silver clusters holds great promise for superstructures with collective properties due 
to the higher capacity of interactions and shorter interaction distances.
Ag23(8e) series. Zhu et  al. assembled [Ag23(SAdm)12]3+ (Ag23(8e), in which 
SAdm = 1-adamantanethiol, i.e. C10H15S, a chiral superatom complex nanocluster) 
with inorganic SbF6
− linkers and constructed two superatom complex inorganic frame-
work (SCIF) materials, including [Ag23(SAdm)12](SbF6)2X (Ag23-SbF6-1; X  =  Cl−/
SbF6
−) and [Ag23(SAdm)12](SbF6)3 (Ag23-SbF6-2). Ag23-SbF6-1 and Ag23-SbF6-2 exhibit 
two superstructures with interpenetrating frameworks [46]. Topological analysis indi-
cates that Ag23-SbF6-1 exhibits a 3D architecture with (424·64)-bcu topology. Two super-
structures composed of monomers with opposite configurations interpenetrate to form 
a complete Ag23-SbF6-1 framework with a channel diameter of ∼4.8 Å. In Ag23-SbF6-2, 
Ag23(8e) clusters are assembled into a 3D tubular hollow hexagonal structure with an 
average pore diameter of 11.7 Å. Topological analysis indicates that Ag23(8e) exhibits a 
3D architecture with (49·66)-acs topology (Figure 2.15a).
Ag(I)20, Ag(I)22 series. Sun et  al. used the “large cluster and small bridge” 
strategy to create two high-dimensional silver cluster-based MOFs, [CO3@
Ag20(iPrS)10(NO3)8(DMF)2]n (Ag20-NO3) and [SO4@Ag22(iPrS)12(NO3)6·2NO3]n 
(Ag22-NO3), which feature a CO3
2−-templated D5d-symmetric Ag(I)20 and a SO4
2−-
templated Td-symmetric Ag(I)22 cluster unit, respectively [47]. Their atomically pre-
cise structures were confirmed by SCXRD analysis and further consolidated by IR 
spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and elemental analysis. Each 
drum-like Ag20 cluster is extended by twelve NO3
− ions to form the 2D sql lattice of 
Ag20-NO3, whereas each ball-shaped Ag(I)22 cluster with a twisted truncated tetra-
hedral geometry is pillared by four [Ag6(NO3)3] triangular prisms to form the 3D 
interpenetrated dia network of Ag22-NO3. Notably, Ag22-NO3 is the first interpene-
trated 3D MOF constructed from silver clusters (Figure 2.15b). These results dem-
onstrate the dual role of the anions, which not only internally act as anion templates 
to induce the formation of silver thiolate clusters but also externally extend the clus-
ter units into the rigid networks.
Ag(I)5 series. Zang et al. reported the effect of Na+ ions on the formation and struc-
tural transformation of metal cluster-based assemblies. A pair of 2D chiral frameworks 
[NaAg5(R/S-L)6(H2O)2(CH3OH)]·Na[Ag5(R/S-L)6] (denoted as R/S-Ag5-Na) built with 
R/S-tert-butyl-3-mercaptopyrrolidine-1-carboxylate (R-L, S-L)-protected Ag5 clusters 
bridged by Na+ were prepared [48]. Notably, in the channels of the frameworks were 
orderly arranged discrete anion (Ag5L6)− clusters (Ag(I)5 clusters for short).  
The layers further adopt an AA stacking mode and form 3D supramolecular

structures with channels along the c-axis. The distance between two adjacent layers 
(from kernel Ag to kernel Ag) is ca. 9.125 Å. Interestingly, the orange fluorescent 
R/S-Ag5-Na transformed to [Ag5(R/S-L)6]− (denoted as R/S-Ag5-3) with bright 
green Fl under ambient conditions. Structural analysis of the intermediate 
[Ag5(R/S-L)6]− (2D) (denoted as R/S-Ag5-2) reveals that the coordinated methanol 
and water molecules of the sodium nodes gradually leave upon evaporation of the 
solvent molecules, resulting in disordering of the Na+ ions and then to a thermody-
namically stable dense packing pattern (Figure 2.16). This work structurally eluci-
dates the transformation process of Ag(I)5 cluster-based assemblies and provides 
new insights into the atom-precise interactions between the sodium ions and metal 
clusters.
2.3.2.2  POMs Linkers
Polyoxometalates (POMs) are a class of inorganic oxo-enriched clusters with con-
trollable shapes and sizes, highly negative charges, and universally structural topol-
ogies. Benefiting from the strong oxophilicity of silver, POMs were employed as 
anionic templates to induce the formation of high-nuclearity silver nanoclusters. 
The Sun group and others prepared a series of POM-templated silver clusters, 
including Ag44@Mo6O22 and Ag50@Mo8O28, as well as three-shell structures of

Ag10@(W7O26)2@Ag74 and Ag10@(Mo7O26)2@Ag70, to name a few, with different 
size, geometry, and compositions. Notably, in some cases, the POMs could undergo 
a structural transformation in the synthesis to generate unprecedented POMs in 
situ, which conversely enriches the library of POMs [3, 49]. Moreover, silver cluster-
POM hybrids with inverted structures, that is, silver nanoclusters encapsulated in 
hollow POM framework, have also been reported [50].
Not unnaturally, the multidentate POMs can also act as bulk linkers to bridge the 
silver clusters. Jansen et al. synthesized the first chain-like intercluster compounds 
containing large, novel silver alkynyl clusters as cationic building blocks, which are 
linked to the polyanions by direct silver–oxygen contacts [51]. Later on, the Mak 
and Lu groups contributed in the study of POM-based silver alkynyl clusters [49, 52].  
Xie et al. also fabricated an extended two-dimensional infinite sheet formed by link-
ing 1D silver cluster-based polymeric motifs, which consist of Ag11S9 clusters inter-
connected by thiolate ligands and [Mo6O19]2– anions through intermolecular Ag⋯O 
weak interactions [53]. The Zang group prepared two novel POM-based thiolate-
protected silver coordination polymers, the one-dimensional Ag10-Mo6 and two-
dimensional Ag18-Mo6, in high yields under essentially identical systems  [54]. 
Ag10-Mo6 showed chain-like structures with an Ag10 core bridged by [Mo6O19]2− 
anions and exhibited bright green PL (Figure 2.17a). Ag18-Mo6 contains a unique 
20-membered cycle-Ag10S10 with a diameter of approximately 11.382 Å resulting 
from the compact interlinking of alternating silver and sulfur atoms. Interconnecting 
the ring-shaped-Ag10S10 and the Ag3StBu and AgCH3CN motifs formed aesthetic 
Ag–S sheets (Figure 2.17b). In addition, [Mo6O19]2− polyanions not only served as 
counter ions to fill in the large gaps of the ring-shaped-Ag10S10 to balance the charges 
of the whole molecule, but also served to stabilize the structure by acting as inor-
ganic ligands and forming Ag−O bonds.
2.3.2.3  Organic Bi/Multidentate Linkers
Directional coordination assembly performed on Ag(I)12, Ag14(2e), and Ag(I)10 
models by post-coordination substitution using N-containing bidentate and multi-
dentate linkers is explored in detail. Linkers of different sizes and configurations 
connect various types of silver clusters into 1D, 2D, and even 3D patterns using the

coordination assembly strategy. The assembly process and structural characteristics 
are presented. Compared with isolated silver clusters, the stability of SCAM has 
generally been considerably enhanced.
Ag(I)12 series. Huang et al. pioneered SCAM by using bidentate linkers, which 
have been called SCC-MOF since the SCAM possesses a rigid 3D framework in which 
silver cluster building blocks are embedded as nodes (Figure 2.18a) [55]. The first 
SCAM is named Ag12-bpy ([Ag12(StBu)8(CF3COO)4(bpy)4]n, bpy = 4,4′-­bipyridine), 
which was produced from a distorted cuboctahedral dodecanuclear cluster [(Ag12 
(StBu)6(CF3COO)6(CH3CN)6)] using the ligand exchange method. During conversion 
from Ag(I)12 to Ag12-bpy, a bidentate bpy ligand connected two new silver(I) clusters 
(Ag12S8
4−), which are deformed relative to the original Ag(I)12 and acted as nodes. As 
a result, the weakly ligated CH3CN molecules escaped, and Ag12-bpy grew into to a 
porous coordination framework. In the host framework of Ag12-bpy, each Ag12S8
4− 
node is linked to four adjacent nodes via eight μ2-bpy bridges, and an open rectangu-
lar channel with dimensions of approximately 11.8 × 6.5 Å2 appeared. Ag12bpy has 
21.6% void space. Compared with the discrete Ag(I)12 clusters, the framework Ag12-bpy, 
where Ag12S8 clusters as nodes are periodically immobilized in three dimensions, dem-
onstrated greatly improved stability under ambient conditions and RT PLQY (12%).

The unique open framework, along with long-term stability and excellent lumines-
cence, hold promise as excellent luminescent sensors.
They later investigated the effect of modification of the substituents on the bpy 
linker of Ag12-bpy on RT emission  [56]. [Ag12(StBu)8(CF3COO)4(bpy-NH2)4]n 
(abbreviated as Ag12-bpy-NH2) having 3-amino-4,4′-bipyridine (bpy-NH2) bearing 
an electron-donating –NH2 group, [Ag12(StBu)8(CF3COO)4(bpy-CH3)4]n, (abbrevi-
ated as Ag12-bpy-CH3) possessing 3-methyl-4,4′-bipyridine (bpy-CH3) with a 
weakly electron-donating methyl group, [Ag12(StBu)8(CF3COO)4(bpy-F)4]n (abbre-
viated as Ag12-bpy-F) containing 3-fluorine-4,4′-bipyridine (bpy-F), which has a 
molecular framework isostructural with that of Ag12-bpy (Figure 2.18b). The feasi-
ble modification of linkers in SCAMs paves the way to multi-functionalization and 
subsequent research based on the fundamental principles of structure–function 
relationships.
Interesting, by tuning the synthesis methods, the reversible cluster-node isomeri-
zation occurred between a separated silver core and an empty cuboctahedral one, 
accompanied by significant differences in properties. Huang et al. first transformed 
tetragonal Ag12-bpy ([(Ag12(StBu)8(CF3COO)4(bpy)4)]n) into a new trigonal SCAM

vent at RT; the solvent-free empty framework [(Ag12(StBu)6(CF3COO)6(bpy)3]n was 
designated as Ag12-bpy-2, and the reverse transformation was also successfully 
achieved by solvents (Figure 2.19) [57]. This isomerization directly resulted in con-
siderable change in electronic structure and hence distinctly different luminescence 
(a single green emission of Ag12-bpy vs. a red-blue dual emission of Ag12-bpy-2 at 
low temperature). DFT calculations revealed that the different electron density dis-
tribution of LUMOs determined by the geometric structure of silver cluster contrib-
uted to the different emissive behavior. Moreover, a mixed-linker approach was 
employed for the preparation of dual-emissive thermochromic Ag12-bpy-2/NH2, 
and solvent-assisted linker exchange (SALE) for the preparation of dichromatic 
core–shell Ag12-bpy-2@Ag12-bpy-NH2-2.
The cuboctahedra of Ag12S6 nodes could be further assembled into 1D to 3D 
framework structures by bi/multidentate ligands, including bpy, bpy-NH2, bpa

(4-pyridyl)porphyrin) [21, 58–63]. In the cluster nodes of these SCAMs, the cuboc-
tahedron consisting of twelve Ag atoms linked through Ag(I)–Ag(I) bonding often 
displays C3v or quasi-C3v symmetry, in which cuboctahedral or quasi-cuboctahedral 
Ag skeletons are connected via Ag–N bonds. Among them, Ag12-BPHF@CB[6]

shows a series of 1D silver cluster-assembled beaded chain structures [58]. Ag12-
TPPA features a 2D network structure with an AA packing pattern and spontane-
ously transforms into the thermodynamically favored closer stacking pattern (AB 
and ABC) upon solvent molecule escape [59]. Ag12-CPPP features a two-fold self-
interpenetrated 3D framework [60]. Ag12-TPPE is characterized by a highly sym-
metrical 3D network, in which the diameter of its cubic cage reaches 32 Å [61]. 
Ag12Ag8-TPPE is notable because it incorporates two types of Ag8 and Ag12 cluster 
nodes [62]. The structural diversity of SCAMs and the introduction of attractive 
functional linkers could bring about a broader application range (Figure 2.20).
Ag14(2e) series. When coordination-assembling strategies are applied to mixed-
valence [Ag14(C2B10H10S2)6(CH3CN)8]·4CH3CN (Ag14-CH3CN) clusters using ­variable- 
length bidentate N-heteroaromatic ligands (pyrazine (py)), di-pyridin-4-yl-diazene 
(dpz), bpy, 1,4-bis(4-pyridyl)benzene (dpbz), 1D-to 3D-superatomic silver cluster-
assembled materials are produced by Zang et al. [20], which include{[Ag14(C2B10H10S2)6

Ag14-dpz exhibits a 2D network structure with rhomboidal grids of 1.4 × 1.4 nm. The 
open channels of Ag14-bpy have dimensions of 1.3 × 1.8 nm. The longer dpbz ligand

Ag14-dpbz still displayed high porosity (45.4%) with a pore size of approximately 
1.12 nm and a surface area of 69.3 m2 g−1 with high stability up to 220 °C. The success-
ful coordination assembly of Ag0/1+ clusters again demonstrated the feasibility of linker 
engineering and opened a door to future applicable functionality for superatomic clus-
ters and other metal clusters as solid-state materials.
In recent years, Zheng et  al. reported the assembly between the racemic 
Ag14(SPh(CF3)2)12(PPh3)4(DMF)4 (Ag14-DMF) clusters with highly flexible ligand 
shells and bidentate linkers with different configurations (namely, (1R,2R,N1E,N2E)-
N1,N2-bis(pyridin-3-ylmethylene)cyclohexane-1,2-diamine (LR) and the corre-
sponding chiral analog LS)  [64]. Specifically, by using chiral linkers LR or LS, 
optically pure chiral SCC-MOFs exhibiting mirror symmetry can be obtained. 
Interestingly, the asprepared racemic Ag14 clusters were converted into homochiral 
R-Ag14 or S-Ag14 building blocks in [Ag14(SPh(CF3)2)12(PPh3)4(LR/LS)2]n (Ag14-LR 
or Ag14-LS), respectively, during the assembly process, implying that the linkers not 
only play a role in connecting the cluster building units but also can influence the 
chirality of building units (Figure 2.22). In contrast, by using the racemic linkers 
LRS (equi-mixture of LR and LS), a 3D achiral assembly material containing an 
equimolar ratio of R-Ag14 and S-Ag14 as nodes and exhibiting a diamond-like topol-
ogy was obtained. Moreover, the crystals of the monomeric R-Ag14m and S-Ag14m 
clusters, obtained through the disassembly of the corresponding Ag14-LR and 
Ag14-LS, respectively, are optically pure. The chirality-directing effect observed here 
may open a new way for creating chiral SCC-MOF materials. Furthermore, the chi-
rality memory effect may be utilized in the enantioconversion of racemate clusters 
through the assembly-disassembly strategy demonstrated here. It is hoped that 
these effects will find applications in chirality-related science and technology, such 
as chiral synthesis, chiral sensors, chiral separation, and asymmetric catalysis.
Ag(I)10 series. Capsule-like Ag10S6 core with a parallel Ag3–Ag4–Ag3 three-layer 
silver atom arrangement is also frequently seen in the SCAMs. Based on this Ag10 
cluster node, the Zang group reported a hydrogen-bonded pillared-layered 2D

a multidentate phenylphosphonic acid (PhPO3H2) ligand as a functional hydrogen-
bond donor and a 1D polymer [Ag10(StBu)6(CF3CF2COO)4(bpy)2(CH3CN)2]n (Ag10-
bpy-2) in succession  [65, 66]. In Ag10-bpy-1, each [Ag10(StBu)6] cluster core is 
connected by four bpy linkers, resulting in a layered architecture with rhombic grids 
in the ab plane (Figure  2.23a). Two hydrogen-bonded PhPO3H linkers are each 
located at the apex of the Ag10S6 capsule. The interlayer hydrogen bonds lead to the 
layers stacking in a staggered A–B manner to form a 3D supramolecular structure, 
where grids stack over each other in an offset fashion to yield the closed-porous 
phase with 9.6% void space. Ag10-bpy-2 contains a highly related Ag10 node, which 
was also bridged by bpy yet into a 1D polymer (Figure 2.23b). The cluster nodes are 
also four-connected, but the linkers are oriented in the same direction. Two CH3CN 
molecules are located in diagonal positions of the Ag10S6 core, the loss of which 
causes an elongation of the capsule Ag10S6 and, accordingly, the distortion of the 
supramolecular structure. Such a process is reversible in CH3CN vapor.
Other cluster nodes. Other silver clusters with different size and geometrical 
structures are also reported as nodes in SCAMs. For instance, Ma et al. reported a 
novel 1D SCAM Ag18-bpy-NH2 prepared by employing an intensely luminescent 
bpy-NH2 linker bridging the novel Ag18S10 clusters [67]. Each cluster node contains 
18 silver ions co-stabilized by 10 thiolates: two CF3COO−, four PhPO3H−, and one 
PhPO3
2−. The overall cluster node is analogous to the drum-like Ag(I)20 but with 
PhPO3
2− replacing the CO3
2– template. The steric hindrance of the bulkier PhPO3
2− 
might account for the lower nuclearity (Figure 2.24a).
The Bakr group reported an Ag(I)16 cluster showing a distorted square gyrobicu-
pola polyhedron templated by one enclosed Cl− in the center (Figure 2.24b) [68]. By 
adding bpy and adjusting the ratio of the bpy linker to the Ag-thiolate complex in 
the synthesis, they obtained two distinct clusters, Ag15 and Ag14, each adopting a

MOF-like structure with specific dimensionality (i.e. Ag15-bpy and Ag14-bpy, 
respectively) (Figure 2.9b). The cluster units in Ag15-bpy and Ag14-bpy share nota-
ble similarities. In particular, the units possess a similar geometrical structure in 
which the skeletons of cluster cores can be considered to be incomplete square gyro-
bicupolas. 0D Ag(I)16, 1D Ag15-bpy, and 2D Ag14-bpy exhibit qualitatively distinct 
characteristics in PL and thermal stability. Specifically, higher-dimensional struc-
tures show enhanced PL and higher thermal stability.
Recently, Zhao et  al. presented a cationic 2D coordination structure {[Ag27S2 
(tBuS)14(CF3COO)8(TPyP-H2)](CF3COO)}n (Ag27-TPyP-H2) based on ­saddle- 
shaped, 27-nuclear silver clusters linked by a multitopic porphyrin-based ligand 
5,10,15,20-tetra(4-pyridyl)porphyrin (TPyP-H2)  [69]. The saddle-shaped Ag(I)27 
cluster node is protected by fourteen tBuS− and eight CF3COO− ligands, as well as 
templated by two enclosed S2− ions. The overall cluster adopts a C2v group symme-
try. Due to the multitopic configuration of TPyP-H2, it is bonded to four Ag27 clus-
ters through four pyridyl groups, forming a square node. Ag27-TPyP-H2 adopts the 
4-connected unimodal net with {44·62}-sql net topology, with both Ag(I)27 cluster 
node and TPyP-H2 treated as 4-connectors (Figure 2.24c).

2.4  ­Applications
Besides the inherent properties of the individual metal cluster and linker, the inte-
gration of them in SCAMs usually facilitates novel photophysical behaviors bene-
fited from the various charge transfer pathways generated. In addition, the porous 
structure of SCAMs allows the adsorption of small molecules, which might endow 
SCAMs with luminescent sensing, molecular recognition, or catalytic properties.
2.4.1  Luminescent Switching and Sensing Oxygen and VOCs
Robust and flexible SCAMs or SCC-MOFs have excellent and susceptible lumines-
cent properties, including emission intensity, color, and lifetime. These materials 
show different host–guest interactions, which always occur with synchronous vari-
ation of emissive parameters, and also provide an excellent opportunity for lumines-
cent switching and sensing. Thus, luminescent switching for some specific entities, 
such as oxygen and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), can be achieved. Further 
suitable modification of linkers can produce a dual-emissive SCAM used for lumi-
nescent switching. In this section, the representative luminescence sensing and 
switching of Ag12-bpy, Ag12-bpy-NH2, Ag12-bpy-CH3, Ag10-bpy-1, Ag12Ag8-TPPE, 
and Ag12-CPPP will be discussed.
Ag12-bpy demonstrated remarkably enhanced stability for longer than one year, a 
QY of 12.1%, and a lifetime of 200 ns at RT. This new SCC-MOF can function in 
ultrafast dual-function luminescence switching (<1 second), that is, turn-off by O2 
and multicolored turn-on by VOCs [55]. The switching mechanism was distinctly 
resolved by SCXRD structural analysis of O2/VOCs-included crystals, highlighting 
the importance of structural precision (Figure 2.25a). Fl and phosphorescence (Ph) 
are particular cases of luminescence. Fl originates from the first excited singlet state 
S1, while Ph originates from the triplet state T1. The amino-modified Ag12-bpy-NH2 
displayed two emissive peaks, one of which is a blue sub-nanosecond Fl component 
(0.37 ns under vacuum) at approximately 456 nm and the other Ph at 556 nm (3.12 ms 
under vacuum). Compared with the 200 ns Ph of Ag12-bpy, the lifetime of the Ph 
component of Ag12-bpy-NH2 is prolonged by approximately 15 000-fold, with an 
approximate 2% increase in QY. Thus, Ag12-bpy-NH2 could detect trace oxygen gas 
in 0.3 second with a limit of detection (LOD) as low as 0.1 ppm in a ratiometric 
method, in which blue insensitive Fl functioned as a reference signal (Figure 2.25b) 
[56]. When the O2 concentration varied in the range of zero to 20 ppm, the lighting 
color of Ag12-bpy-NH2 contemporaneously varied, enabling the visible color 
response. When the –CH3 groups are anchored on the bpy linkers, they can interfere 
with the process by which the oxygen molecules interact with the emissive frame-
work and greatly decrease the response sensitivity to molecular oxygen. The authors 
then combined the luminescence characteristics of Ag12-bpy-NH2 and Ag12-
bpy-CH3, and prepared the mixed-linker Ag12-bpy-NH2/CH3, which extended the 
ratiometric sensing range. The variable substitutes on likers significantly tuned the 
luminescence sensing performance of SCAMs again, which promises more novel 
and unprecedented phenomena worthy of exploring.

The flexible luminescent SCC-MOF Ag10-bpy-1 exhibits a remarkable framework 
breathing phenomenon upon adsorption of VOCs, accompanied by distinct respon-
sive Fl [65]. Three chloro derivatives of methane, namely, CH2Cl2, CHCl3, and CCl4, 
could be easily distinguished because of their striking difference of luminescent 
color in visible light (Figure 2.25c): CH2Cl2 displayed no shift (green), CCl4 showed 
a 15 nm redshift (yellow–green), and CHCl3 displayed the biggest redshift of 52 nm 
(yellow). The detailed investigation of CHCl3- and CH2Cl2-induced structural 
dynamics and their structure-luminescence correlation, together with well-defined 
crystallographic characterization of the open- and closed-pore forms, well addressed 
such solvatochromism behaviors.
Since the linkers intrinsically have aggregation-induced emission (AIE) units, 
both Ag12-TPPE, Ag12Ag8-TPPE, and Ag12-CPPP with very large pores uniformly 
display interesting guest-triggered luminescent phenomena, including emission 
enhancement, CPL, emission of white light, and RT Ph [60–62]. In addition, many 
other SCAMs in which the number of silver atoms is not limited to the listed Ag(I)12 
and Ag14(2e) cluster-assembled materials manifest various excellent sensing and 
switching properties. Grafting AIE properties onto silver clusters or SCAMs would 
extend the application of both silver clusters and organic AIE-type molecules in 
crystalline materials.
2.4.2  Ratiometric Luminescent Temperature Sensing
Coinage metal clusters are known as potential temperature-sensing luminescent 
materials, mainly owing to the shrinking and elongation of metal–metal bonds 
upon temperature change. The introduction of linkers could establish bi- or multi-
emission centers in some SCAMs, which can be present in clusters and linkers, 
respectively. The distinct sensitivities to temperature of respective emission centers 
promise great potential in ratiometric temperature sensing. For Ag14-dpbz, two 
emission peaks are observed when the temperature ranges from 83 K to RT 
(Figure 2.26a) [20]. When the temperature was decreased, the emission peak with a

maximum at 518 nm grew much faster and became dominant at temperatures lower 
than 263 K, whereas the red emission band in the range of 580–700 nm became 
weaker. As a result, thermochromism of Ag14-dpz was observed, ranging widely 
from green to red. For the crystals of mixed-linker compound Ag12-bpy-2/NH2 
(20 : 1), temperature-dependent emission peaks and visual temperature sensing by 
color from purple pink to blue were observed (Fig. 2.26b) [57]. A linear correlation 
of temperature (T) to the emission intensity ratio was found in the range 83–233 K 
(sensitivity 0.347% K–1).
2.4.3  Catalytic Properties
The synergic effect between building blocks, including silver clusters and organic 
linkers of SCAMs, would produce novel collective functionality. [Ag12(StBu)6 
(CF3COO)3(TPyP)]n (Ag12-TPyP) has rich pores with a Brunauer–Emmett–Teller 
(BET) surface area of 234 m2 g−1 and excellent chemical stability in air and various 
organic solvents  [63]. Ag12-TPyP also has strong affinity for 2-chloroethyl ethyl 
sulfide (CEES) due to its unique pore structure and the interactions between the 
silver cluster and chlorine atoms of CEES, such that it shows rapid and high-dose 
adsorption of CEES. The porphyrin linkers in Ag12-TPyP have excellent light- 
harvesting capability and 1O2 generation. Due to the synergistic efficiency between 
the silver cluster, porphyrin-based linkers, and the unique pores of SCAMs, Ag12-
TPyP efficiently degraded mustard-gas simulants with a half-life of 1.5 minutes and 
100% selectivity by visible light (Figure 2.27a).
Later on, Ag27-TPyP-H2 was also studied as a high-performance catalyst for CO2-
cycloadditions of N-propargylamines [69]. Ag27-TPyP-H2 shows high chemical sta-
bility and significant affinity toward CO2 (Figure 2.27b). The amount of CO2 uptake 
is 14.5 and 10.3 cm3 g−1 at 273 and 300 K, corresponding to about 3.8 and 2.7 CO2 
molecules per formula unit, respectively. These virtues facilitate its potential appli-
cation in serving as a heterogeneous catalyst for CO2 fixation. Moreover, the exposed 
silver nodes in the 2D framework could activate the C≡C bonds through favorable 
Ag⋯π interactions. Accordingly, Ag27-TPyP-H2 shows excellent catalytic perfor-
mance for carboxylative cyclization of propargylamines with CO2. Benefited from

2.5  ­Conclusion and Perspectives
In this chapter, we have summarized the modification and assembly strategies to 
improve the stability, enhance the emissive properties, and develop functionality of 
novel silver cluster and silver cluster assembled materials. Through the modulation 
of shell layer, especially the protect ligands, it can be extended to the use of alkyne, 
carbene, nitrile, hetero N, S or N, P ligands, bi-/multidentate, and chiral ligands, as 
well as various types of supramolecular building blocks and extraneous species, 
which provides a huge treasure pool for future research and application of silver 
clusters. In addition, the ensembles of mixed-valence silver clusters have much 
room for development, as these systems could exhibit high-performance properties 
and novel functions and find versatile applications. Novel and general approaches 
to assemble superatoms into oligomers and extended structures must also be actively 
developed. Particular emphasis should be placed on creating strongly coupled mate-
rials. Of course, the union of supramolecular assembly and coordination chemistry 
of silver clusters may create some unprecedented and desirable properties of cluster- 
based materials. Further efforts are needed to unravel the fundamental origin and 
devise new strategies for boosting the synergistic effect between shell layers and 
metal cluster cores. In addition, it is also necessary to create new functionalities for 
clusters for practical applications.
Currently, the supramolecular chemistry of silver clusters is at a dawning stage. 
Nevertheless, more relatively stable models for exploring the process are needed. 
The coordination chemistry and functionalization of silver clusters are continu-
ously on the rise, but they are still limited to several successful models. Therefore, 
the synthesis and crystallization habits of stable Ag1+ and Ag0/1+ clusters, as well as 
their structural determination, are still of great importance in future research. The 
modification and assembly of silver clusters could foster a diversity of novel func-
tions and applications. First, successive developments of high-performance fluoro-
genic adducts or ensemble chemosensing systems can be expected. Second, novel 
magnetic and electronic properties could well be created via the use of functional 
macro-molecules. Third, catalysis enhancement by cluster systems can be a signifi-
cant research direction due to the unique reactivity of silver. Fourth, long-lifespan 
excited states could be applied to energy science. Fifth, metal clusters that emit NIR 
would be a type of promising emitter applied in bioimaging, optical signal process-
ing, and night-vision technologies. Probably, the study of mixed-valence metal clus-
ters would become a research hot spot in the NIR-II (1000–1700 nm) biological 
window. Sixth, the inherent solution processability of metal clusters would support 
functional devices such as in LEDs and optical sensors. Seventh, the chiral and heli-
cal materials involving silver and other metal clusters could find applications in 
biology, medicine, and polarized light-related fields. Last but not least, the hierar-
chical arrangement of metal clusters driven by various inter-shell layer interactions

between homo- or hetero-clusters can generate more versatile assemblies, which 
could provide opportunities to better understand equal-level biosystems. With a 
deeper understanding of the fundamentals of structure–property relationship and 
the role of shell layers in dictating properties and functionality, one can expect that 
the designed synthesis of functional silver clusters and silver-assembled materials 
will find new applications in luminescence, catalysis, photo harvesting, optical-
electrical technology, as well as antibacterial, time-gated imaging, and biologi-
cal fields.

3.1  ­Introduction
Copper (Cu) clusters are based on earth-abundant and inexpensive Cu metal. They 
have been subjected to a wide range of investigations for their excellent physical–
chemical properties [1–4]. However, the stability of atomically precise Cu clusters is 
urgently required for the challenge of the high susceptibility of the metal toward oxi-
dation. Surface-protecting ligands are important in the synthesis of stable clusters and 
for manipulating their properties. Surface ligands with high metal binding affinities 
are widely used in the construction of stable Cu clusters, such as thiolate, phosphine, 
and alkynyl ligands [5–8]. Cu clusters exhibit outstanding luminescence and catalytic 
properties for their d–d transitions and variable oxidation states [9–11]. Their proper-
ties can be regulated and improved through modification and assembly strategies. 
Herein, the synthesis, modification, and assembly of Cu clusters are summarized.
Recently, atomically precise metal nanoclusters (MNCs) have attracted consider-
able interest because of their extraordinary properties [12–15]. Molecular-like prop-
erties derived from quantized electronic states provide opportunities for constructing 
unique nanomaterials with rich molecular-like absorption, luminescence, and mag-
netism. Monolayer-protected metal NCs, particularly Cu, possess a clear molecular 
structure and composition. This field is relatively new, with a history of approxi-
mately two to three decades [16, 17].
The significant interest in Cu chalcogenide NCs lies in three aspects: (i) their 
abundance, low cost, and reduced environmental and health impacts compared 
with those of cadmium- and lead-based compounds. (ii) Cu is a 3D transition metal 
with fascinating physical and chemical properties. Cu-based materials can promote 
and experience various reactions because Cu has a wide range of accessible oxida-
tion states (Cu0, CuI, CuII, and CuIII), which enable reactions through single-­electron 
and double-electron paths. (iii) its structure, composition, and stoichiometric versa-
tility, including rich nonstoichiometric phases, extensive solid solutions, and associ-
ated low defect formation energies [18–20].
The composition and structure of CuNCs are crucial in stimulating their remark-
able properties. First, the atomicity and arrangement of Cu atoms can directly

­determine these properties. Second, the various oxidation states of Cu (+II, +I, and 0)  
can naturally nourish different Cu cores. CuNCs with the characteristics of Cu(0), 
superatom (oxidation state between 0 and I), homovalent Cu(I), and mixed-valent 
Cu(I)/Cu(II) have been recently prepared. Third, the outermost organic ligand can 
protect the Cu core from aggregation and promote the formation of new CuNCs. 
Thus, widely used ligands, including alkynyl, phosphine, and thiolate, have been 
used to prepare CuNCs. Hydrides (H–) have also been introduced to generate Cu 
hydride NCs, an appealing class of CuNCs [21–23]. Owing to their remarkable flex-
ibility in composition and structure, CuNCs have inherently variable properties and 
applications.
3.2  ­Synthesis and Properties of Cu Clusters
The synthesis procedures are important for obtaining high-quality nanomaterials. 
Researchers have developed an extensive interest in synthesizing nanomaterials 
because of the unique and extraordinary applications of these materials in modern 
science [24]. Thus, various chemical and physical methods have been developed 
and employed for the large-scale synthesis of metal NCs with precise atomic com-
positions. The breakthrough in the field of nanomaterial science, starting in the 
early 1990s, facilitated the synthesis of particles down to sub-nanometer sizes. 
Over the last few decades, tremendous progress has been made for noble metals 
(gold and silver) protected by organic and water-soluble ligands. Structural deter-
mination has advanced the understanding of the formation mechanisms and the 
development of efficient and effective protocols for the synthesis of unique func-
tional building blocks. However, despite the extensive progress in the field of gold 
and silver NCs, studies on the preparation and functionalization of other metals, 
such as earth-abundant Cu, are still in their infancy. The challenge is in the diffi-
culty of preparing tiny and stable Cu nanoparticles (NPs) and NCs. Cu, which is in 
the same group as gold and silver, exhibits similar properties and is a viable alterna-
tive to expensive and rare metals. Thus, the procedures for the preparation of gold 
and silver clusters have been directly applied to the synthesis of CuNCs [25–27]. 
With modifications and slight changes in the synthesis methods and reaction con-
ditions, the difficulty of preparing atomically precise and stable CuNCs has been 
overcome.
We grouped the synthesis of Cu and Cu-based NPs into three categories: (i) Cu 
and Cu oxide (CuOx) NPs, (ii) supported Cu-based NPs, and (iii) other Cu-based 
NPs. The discussion of materials in the first category covers the synthesis of Cu 
metal and/or Cu oxide NPs. This section emphasizes the synthesis protocols preva-
lent in previous studies. Regarding the second category, we discuss the preparations 
of Cu and Cu-based NPs on supported systems, focusing on the diversity and versa-
tility of support materials. Despite recent efforts and progress in the development of 
supported catalysts, to the best of our knowledge, a systematic review of this field is 
lacking in the existing literature [17, 28–30]. Finally, this section discusses the syn-
thesis of other Cu-containing NPs, including metal alloys and multimetallic 

3.2  ­Synthesi s and  Propertie s of  Cu Cluster

systems. The main objective of this section is to review the procedures employed to 
synthesize Cu and Cu-based NPs with emphasis on recent examples. Three tables 
are presented, listing the reported synthesis strategies for preparing materials in 
each category. In the “product description” columns of the tables, Cu-based species 
(Cu-oxides and others) are described, whereas the entries without such mentions 
show that the corresponding synthesis procedures led to the formation of Cu NPs.
Owing to their unique characteristics and properties, Cu clusters have many 
applications in nanotechnology, including catalytic organic transformation, electro-
catalysis, and photocatalysis [31, 32]. The main challenge in the development of 
catalytic clusters is the preparation of highly active, selective, stable, robust, and 
inexpensive nanomaterials. In addition, the high boiling point of Cu renders it com-
patible with high-temperature and high-pressure chemical reactions, including 
continuous flow reactions, microwave-assisted reactions, vapor phase reactions, 
and various organic transformations. Owing to such properties, which are condu-
cive to the development of reactive and selective catalytic systems, Cu and its alloys 
are among the most valuable metals. The applications of Cu and Cu-based NPs, 
which are based on earth-abundant and inexpensive Cu metal, have recently gener-
ated considerable interest, particularly in the field of catalysis. The possible modifi-
cation of the chemical and physical properties of these NPs using different synthesis 
strategies and conditions, and/or via post-synthesis chemical treatments, is largely 
responsible for the rapid growth of interest in these nanomaterials and their appli-
cations in catalysis.
The synthesis, modification, and assembly of stable, high-nuclear Cu(0) clusters 
using a general method remains full of challenges [33–35]. Indeed, even Cu(0) coor-
dination complexes are exceptionally rare. Up to now, only a very small number of 
Cu(0) nanoclusters are known to date. In the construction of functional NC materi-
als, adopting appropriate strategies and selecting suitable reducing agents are the 
keys to success. Different kinds of synthesis strategies were explored and investi-
gated, such as substitution reaction and ligand exchange, in which an atom or a 
functional group of a molecule is replaced by another atom or functional group is an 
effective way to induce the formation of a stable Cu(0) cluster. And, more impor-
tantly, in the synthesis of Cu(0)-containing clusters, reducing agents that are added, 
such as the Cu powder and Ph2SiH2, are usually employed as the reductive agents in 
the synthesis, which makes it more convenient to achieve high-nuclear Cu(I)/Cu(0) 
clusters. Cu(0) clusters display outstanding luminescence and catalytic properties 
for their d–d transitions and variable oxidation states, and their properties can be 
regulated and improved by modification and assembly strategies. And what is more, 
the well-defined atomic composition and precise crystal structure of Cu(0) nano-
clusters are conducive to exploring the formation mechanism, and the structure-
property relationship of the NCs at an atomic level. Therefore, the controllable 
synthesis, using some appropriate strategy and structure determination of Cu nano-
clusters, is important for the research of nanotechnology. In a word, exploring appli-
cable reaction strategies, and selecting suitable protection ligands, reductants, and 
reaction conditions for the synthesis of Cu(0) NCs would be highly desirable, 
although the built-up processes are still full of challenges.

3.3  ­Modification and Assembly of Copper Clusters
MNCs comprise several to thousands of metal atoms with a diameter below 3 nm. 
Such NCs exhibit unique electronic/geometric structures and physical/chemical 
properties, which differ from those of bulk metal materials. Among metal NCs, 
coinage metal (Au, Ag, and Cu) NCs have attracted extensive attention because of 
their chirality and optical and catalytic properties. Cu is more abundant than gold 
and silver, and Cu(0)/Cu(I) is more reactive and easier to oxidize than silver or gold, 
which renders the preparation of Cu NCs and investigation of their properties dif-
ficult. Using guidelines from papers on gold and silver NCs, thiolate, phosphine, 
and alkynyl ligand-protected Cu NCs have recently attracted increasing attention.
Many synthesis strategies have been recently developed to improve the poor sta-
bility of Cu(I) NCs. The use of the Lewis acid and base theory to regulate the self-
assembly of atoms, and molecules and the use of different thiolate, phosphine, and 
alkyne ligands have improved the stability of Cu(I) NCs to a certain extent. These 
NCs can build various structures. Presently, many Cu(I) NCs are used in catalytic 
organic reactions, hydrogen storage, and release, photoluminescence (PL), biosen-
sors, cell imaging, and other fields.
3.3.1  Thiolates Ligands Modified Copper Clusters
Thiolates are extremely popular and effective ligands used in the preparation and 
passivation of atomically precise gold and silver cluster metal nuclei. Strong sulfur–
metal bonds prevent clusters from aggregating and contribute to their stability; this 
is a prerequisite for their application in optoelectronics and biomedicine. Although 
significant progress has been made in gold and silver clusters protected by thiolate 
with precise molecular composition and good size–property relationship, atomic 
accuracy and the mercaptan protection of Cu clusters are lacking. Although pro-
gress has been made in the preparation of atomically precise chalcogenide bridging 
and Cu hydride clusters, only a few reports on Cu clusters protected by thiolates 
have been published. First, we discuss the “pure” thiolate Cu clusters.
Regarding this category, in 2016, Chen and coworkers reported the synthesis and 
structure of a small Cu6(SR)6 cluster, protected by a 2-mercaptobenzoxazole ligand 
to prevent sodium borohydride from reducing the reaction mixture [36]. The crystal 
structure of Cu6 clusters, with well-defined metal atom filling and metal–ligand 
bonding, has been determined by single-crystal analysis (Figure 3.1a). Cu6 NCs are 
characterized by a twisted octahedron, which combines with mercaptan via a sim-
ple bridging group. In addition, the Cu6 cluster demonstrates excellent performance 
in H2O2 detection with high selectivity and sensitivity, indicating the potential 
application of a nonenzymatic chemical sensor for H2O2 (Figure  3.1b). Hayton  
and coworkers recently reported a synthesis strategy for the preparation of 
­“atlas-sphere”-like Cu12 and Cu13 clusters, both with a [Cu12S6]6+ cuboctahedral core  
[37]. Two other thiolate-protected Cu clusters, Cu7 and Cu74, were reported in 2013 
and 2020 by Fuhr et al. and Burgi et al., respectively [38, 39]. Recently, Zhu et al. 

3.3  ­Modificatio n a nd Assembl y of Coppe r Cluster

reported the synthesis of two thiolated CuNCs comprising [Cu8(SPh)8(Ph3P)4] and 
[Cu11(TBBT)9(PPh3)6](SbF6)2 (where TBBT = 4-tert-butylphenyl mercaptan) [40]. 
These were not completely “pure” thioester-protected clusters; they had phosphine 
ligands that contributed to the composition of the ligand shell. Interestingly, the 
ligand exchange with the PhSeH ligand led to a sharp core transition and formed a 
[Cu13(SePh)13(Ph3P)4] cluster with different atomic stacking modes.
Phosphine ligands are ideal auxiliary ligands and can build Cu clusters with thi-
olate ligands [41–44]. Limberg and coworkers used the tetramercaptotetrathiacalix- 
[4]arene ligand to obtain a Cu(I)thiolate cluster with a unique hollow inorganic ball 
structure [45] (Figure 3.2a,b). The central cage cavity contains Et2NH molecules, and 
the surrounding calixarene units (representing the window of the cavity) contain 
small molecules, such as CH4 or MeCN. These results promote further study of the 
host–guest chemistry of the cluster and extend the study to other noble metal ions. 
Sun et  al. used PPh3 and tBuC6H4S ligands to synthesize a Cu8 cluster  [46]. 
Noteworthily, the directed self-assembly process of Cu8a was deduced by monitoring 
the aggregation-induced emission (AIE) in real-time, and the electron microscopy of 
the dynamically stable intermediates. The polymorphism and different emission 
properties of CuNC aggregates were successfully captured, and the ­structure–optical 
property relationship was established. Importantly, by introducing the nonuniform 
luminescent agent of the carbon point (CD) into the Cu8a aggregate, the “visual” 
fluorescence window was enriched by the mathematical “arrangement and combi-
nation” idea. This provides a huge potential for the real-time application of the opti-
cal sensing of materials (Figure  3.2c,d). Bakr and coworkers reported a simple 
strategy for the synthesis of a new type of Cu NCs, which are co-protected by thioate 
and phosphine ligands [47]. The Cu15 cluster possesses an extraordinarily distorted 
trigonal antiprismatic Cu6 core and a “tri-blade fan”-like structure (unique among 
metal clusters). The cluster exhibits bright emission in the near-infrared (NIR) region 
(≈720 nm) and crystal-induced emission enhancement (CIEE).

3  Modification and Assembly of Copper Clusters

Certain research groups have recently performed meaningful research on metal-
doping Cu clusters [48–50]. Hyeon and coworkers prepared an atomically precise 
[Pt2Cu34(PET)22Cl4]2− NC using a metal-exchange strategy [48]. The single-crystal 
X-ray structure revealed that two directly bonded Pt atoms occupied the two centers 
of an unusually interpenetrating, incomplete biicosahedron core (Pt2Cu18), which 
was stabilized by a Cu16(PET)22Cl4 shell (Figure 3.3a). Furthermore, Pt doping pro-
motes the catalytic performance of CuNCs through the PtCu synergistic effect. Zhu 
and coworkers developed a strategy for activating AIE, based on the aggregation of 
active metal complexes (CuISR) with neutral gold atoms [50]. The structure of the 
product (Au2Cu6 NCs) was successfully determined by X-ray crystallography, which 
showed that six CuSR complexes were aggregated by Au0 atoms. The compound 
exhibits a strong emission centered at 665 nm with a quantum yield of 11.7%. In 
2020, they synthesized the largest Ag–Cu alloy NC. Ag61Cu30 NCs comprise Ag13@
Cu30, which is covered by the peripheral Ag48(SAdm)38S3 shell [49]. In the field of 
NCs, the complete metal connection between the intermediate Cu30 shell and the 
innermost/outermost Ag atoms has been observed for the first time, providing 
insights into the Cu doping mode in alloy nanoclusters (Figure 3.3b).

Zang and coworkers conducted a lot of excellent work on Cu clusters protected by 
thiolate ligands [51–53]. They used cations to control the assembly mode of chiral 
luminescent Cu clusters  [51], such that the assembly material of Cu clusters 
changed from a racemic mixture into a racemic single crystal and, finally, a pure 
chiral enantiomer was obtained. Thus, they realized the transition from chiral opti-
cal activity to a strong circularly polarized fluorescence response. This method pro-
vides an idea and reference for constructing other metal clusters with a circular 
polarization response. They reported that the largest thiolate-protected Cu(I)/Cu(II) 
NC, Cu54, was synthesized using a one-pot method through the spontaneous oxida-
tion of Cu(I) ions in air [52]. A Cu54/TiO2 catalyst demonstrated good activity for the 
photocatalytic degradation of phenol under visible light irradiation.
They successfully synthesized a Cu(0)-containing cluster Cu14(C2B10H10S2)6 
(CH3CN)8 (abbreviated as Cu14-8CH3CN) through a simultaneous reduction strat-
egy in one-pot synthesis  [53]. In the cluster synthetic process, a reducing-cum-­
protecting agent, 1,2-dithiolate-o-carborane, which exhibited intense reducing 
capability, played an important role. The fcc-structure of the Cu14-8CH3CN cluster 
contains a discrete cubic Cu14 core with six face-capping bidentate 1,2-dithiolate-
o-carborane ligands, and eight vertex-capping CH3CN ligands (Figure  3.4). 
Furthermore, for this Cu nanocluster, surface modification was also applicable. When 
4(dimethylamino)benzonitrile (DMABN) was used to replace the CH3CN molecules, 
eight DMABN molecules occupied all fcc corners, giving surface-­modified 
Cu14-8DMABN, which has been characterized by 1H NMR, ESI, and 11B  NMR 
spectrum. These results indicated that site-specific replacement of the coordinated 
solvent molecules in the ligand shell to modify a metal cluster while retaining its 
metal core integrity is feasible and universal (Figure 3.4). Moreover, Cu14-8CH3CN 
shows room-temperature luminescence and good electrocatalytic activities in the 
ethanol oxidation reaction and electrochemical detection of H2O2. This work pro-
vides a perspective for preparing Cu(0)-containing clusters via a self-reduction

procedure, and it serves as a model platform for direct comparison of the physico-
chemical properties of Cu and silver at the nanoscale level.
Bakr and coworkers used a simple synthetic strategy to produce a thiol-protected 
core−shell superatom Cu nanocluster: [Cu61(StBu)26S6Cl6H14]+ (−StBu; tert-­
butylthiolate) [54], which is the largest Cu(0)-containing structurally-solved core−
shell Cu cluster to date. The structure was constituted by the Cu61 nanocluster 
exhibiting a quasi-elongated triangular gyrobicupola (quasi-J36, J36 = Johnson solid) 
Cu19 core, and a shell held together by a novel “18-crown-6” metal-sulfide-like belt 
(Figure 3.5). The synthesis strategy is not very complex, in its typical synthesis, a 
chloroform solution of Cu(I)-StBu thiolate is reduced by a mild reducing agent, 
borane tert-butylamine complex, which plays a crucial role in the formation of the 
resultant Cu(0) NC. In this synthesis process, the use of the thiol ligand confers 
good stability to the resultant superatom Cu nanocluster, which presents a single 
molecular ion peak in mass spectrometry measurements without any cluster frag-
mentation signals – a first observation of its kind for Cu nanoclusters that opens 
new avenues for researchers to study nanocluster composition, charge, stability, and 
reaction mechanisms with advanced characterization tools.

Mandal and coworkers had reported an adamantane-thiol-protected butterfly-like 
NC [Cu18H3(S-Adm)12(PPh3)4Cl2] (Cu18) with a mononuclear Cu(0) at the center 
[55]. This Cu18 NC was synthesized by a modified one-pot synthetic approach, in 
which a Cu(I) salt is strategically reduced by the strong reducing agent NaBH4. 
A smaller-sized metal-rich core is also tactically achieved using a bulky thiolate 
surface-protecting ligand. The 2 electrons Cu18 NC possesses a core–shell configura-
tion with a Cu10H3Cl2 core that is stabilized by the outer Cu8S12P4 metal–ligand 
shell. Cu18 NC exhibits violet emission at room temperature. Theoretical calcula-
tions suggest that the dominant Cu(d)→Cu(d) (octahedron to square pyramid) tran-
sition between the Platonic-solid-like kernel and Johnson-solid-like kernel via the 
Cu(0) center is the main reason for the charge transfer, which is further justified by 
the vacancy-induced distorted structural architecture. For this Cu(0) NC, a host–
guest approach was introduced to enhance its luminescence property of it, which 
also provided additional stability to the NC by protecting the fragile defective metal 
core from hostile oxidation. The surface rigidity of this NC is closely related to the 
nonradiative decay process, and the optimum restriction is efficiently imposed by 
site-specific supramolecular adduct formation. Furthermore, the unique electronic 
structure of this material has been successfully utilized in photocurrent generation 
for a prolonged period. Therefore, this work will give some enlightenment for the 
synthesis of defect-induced Cu nanomaterials and other active metal NCs to improve 
various physical and chemical properties based on the M(0) character.

3.3.2  Phosphine Ligands Modified Cu Clusters
Phosphine ligands are commonly used in the synthesis of gold and silver clusters 
and can be replaced by thiolate ligands to build thiolate-protected gold and silver 
clusters  [56–58]. Although many studies have been conducted on gold and sil-
ver clusters with sufficient phosphine ligands, only a few studies exist on Cu clus-
ters protected by phosphine ligands. Vogt and coworkers reported a cationic 
organo-Cu cluster, [Cu4(PCP)3]+ (PCP = 2,6-(PPh2)2C6H3), with the bulky tridentate 
carbanionic bisphosphine ligand (Figure 3.6a) [59]. The cluster exhibits a bright-
green emission in the solution and solid states. The room-temperature emission 
spectra of the powder and tetrahydrofuran (THF) solution exhibit a narrow band. At 
room temperature, the high PL quantum yield (PLQY) range of the solid is 0.50, and 
the high PLQ range of the THF solution is 0.79. At 77 K, the PLQY of the solid 
increases to 0.71, and the PLQY of the dichloromethane frozen solution increases to 
0.93. Cu clusters exhibit extraordinary PL and electroluminescence properties and 
are rare examples of cationic organic Cu species. They have produced a new class of 
Cu compounds for thermally stable and highly photoluminescent materials.
Hayton and coworkers prepared the first Cu NC with a partial Cu(0) charac-
ter [61]. This material is a new type of Cu25 NC (Figure 3.6c), which is characterized 
by an icosahedral core centered on Cu13. The Cu K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge 
structure and Auger parameter analyses showed for the first time that NCs with 
Cu(0) characteristics can be isolated from Cu. Tanase et al. synthesized hexanuclear 
Cu hydride complexes using a new linear tetraphosphine ligand (meso-Ph2PCH2P-
(Ph)(CH2)4P(Ph)CH2PPh2) that was similar to that of two trinuclear Cu units con-
nected by an organic ligand with a crystallographically imposed inversion center 
(Figure 3.6b). It has been observed that Cu hydride complexes can easily decompose 
formic acid (FA) into H2 and CO2. After optimizing the catalytic conditions, the 
asymmetric binuclear Cu motif bridged by a ligand was proposed as an active sub-
stance to promote the decomposition of FA through the synergistic effect of a Cu2 
scaffold.
Next, we discuss Cu hydride complexes. Tanase et al. used a linear tetraphosphine 
(meso-bis[(diphenylphosphinomethyl)phenylphosphino]methane, dpmppm), to 
synthesize nona- and hexadecanuclear Cu hydride clusters. They formed Cu hydride 
cages of apex-truncated supertetrahedral {Cu9H7}2+ and square-face-capped cuboc-
tahedral {Cu16H14}2+ structures (Figure 3.6d). Kinetically controlled syntheses led to 
the formation of asymmetric {Cu8H6}2+ clusters, which reacted with CO2 under 
mild conditions to yield a linear tetranuclear Cu complex with a formate bridge. 
These results are extremely important for the development of base metal Cu materi-
als to replace precious metal Cu. Further research on this topic, including detailed 
catalytic mechanisms, is ongoing.
Zang and coworkers reported a pair of propeller-like chiral trinuclear Cu(I) 
­clusters using (R)-2,2-bis(diphenylphosphino)-1,1-binaphthyl, and (S)-2,2-bis 
(di-phenylphosphino)-1,1-binaphthyl as ligands  [63]. At room temperature, the 
rotation of the benzene ring was limited, and Cu cluster molecules emitted red fluo-
rescence through the process of cluster center luminescence (Figure 3.7). In a highly

viscous solvent or low-temperature environment, the rotation of the benzene ring is 
strictly limited, resulting in Cu cluster molecules emitting yellow fluorescence 
through the ligand and cluster center charge-transfer process. Importantly, a unique 
photoinduced fluorescence enhancement property was observed for R/S-Cu3  in 
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), which was attributed to the stepwise oxidation of the 
ligand in the clusters.
The precise construction of Cu NCs remains a long-term challenge in nanosci-
ence. It is desirable to develop effective synthesis strategies for Cu NCs. Huang and 
coworkers developed a synthesis strategy called “solvent-mediated precipitating 
synthesis” to synthesize high-purity Cu13H10(SR)3(PPh3)7 NCs [64]. Cu13 NCs con-
tain a triple symmetry axis, and the Cu13 core was protected by a single layer of 
ligands, including hydride, PPh3, and thiolates. The steady-state ultraviolet (UV)–
visible absorption and fluorescence spectra of Cu13 NCs show unique optical absorp-
tion and PL. Zhu and coworkers synthesized and identified three Cu hydride NCs 
through ligand engineering [65]. During the evolution of surface vacancy defect 
Cu28-PPh2Py into defect-free Cu29-P(Ph-Cl)3, and then to other Cu29-P(Ph-Me)3, 
structural adjustment was observed in the metal core, metal shell, core/shell bond-
ing mode, and filling mode. It enabled an understanding of the structural evolution 
and mechanism responsible for the physical and chemical properties. In addition, it 
provides insights into structural surface vacancies and the structure–performance 
relationship in Cu NCs.
Cu electrocatalysts can reduce CO2 to hydrocarbons at high overpotentials. 
However, the mechanism of CO2 reduction on nanostructured Cu catalysts is not 
sufficiently understood. Jiang and coworkers demonstrated that Cu hydride NCs 
with a precise structure provide a unique product selectivity for the electroreduction 
of CO2 at low overpotentials [66]. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations pre-
dict that the existence of negatively charged H– in Cu clusters plays a key role in 
determining the selectivity of the reduction products. Thus, HCOOH is produced 
while CO has a low overpotential. The unique selectivity provided by the lattice 
hydride mechanism leads to further basic and applied research on the electrocata-
lytic reduction of CO2 by Cu hydride NCs and other metal NCs containing hydride.
3.3.3  Alkynyl Ligands Modified Copper Clusters
Alkyne ligands possess more coordination modes than thiolate and phosphine 
ligands and can construct more unique crystal structures. However, the reaction 
between alkyne ligands and Cu+ easily generates insoluble polymers. Thus, the 
research focus of the construction of Cu alkyne (I) clusters is how to effectively pre-
vent or interrupt this polymerization. The stability of Cu alkyne(I) cluster crystals is 
affected by many factors, including chemical composition, atomic structure, and 
surface ligands. In addition, Cu alkyne(I) NCs must be stable to accurately deter-
mine their structures through single-crystal X-ray diffraction and electrospray ioni-
zation mass spectrometry. Thus, it is important to control the size of the cluster 
metal core and the geometry of the surface ligand to improve stability. The clus-
ter structure is the key factor in determining performance. By studying the cluster 

3  Modification and Assembly of Copper Clusters
78
crystal structure, the structure–activity relationship between the new structure and 
properties can be revealed.
In 1966, Corfield and Shearer synthesized tetranuclear polygonal Cu4 with 
HC≡CPh, which is the first reported atomically precise Cu alkyne(I) NC [67]. In 
1993, Weiss and coworkers obtained 24  nuclear Cu(I) clusters, [(tBuC≡CCu)24], 
with full alkynyl protection [68]. This marked the birth of high nuclear Cu(I) NCs. 
Afterward, Che and coworkers reported a Cu(I) cluster, [tBuC≡CCu]20, which fea-
tures a Cu8 unit ring in the alkyne Cu(I) cluster that coordinates with the other two 
Cu6 unit rings [69]. The aforementioned study provides a good reference for the 
subsequent study of the structure and properties of alkyne Cu(I) compounds. In 
2016, they successfully synthesized a series of all-alkynyl-protected Cu(I) clusters 
with different structures using various alkynyl ligands in different solvents [70]. To 
semiquantitatively represent the size of the steric hindrance formed by alkynyl 
ligands on the surface of the metal core (Figure 3.8a), they introduced the “cone 
angle” formed by the spatial structure of the ligand and metal core θ. This concept 
confirmed that the cone angle had a good correlation with the number of nuclei 
constituting the complex. These results showed that the larger substituents on the 
alkynyl ligands were conducive to the formation of clusters, whereas the smaller 
substituents easily formed polymer structures.
As is known, Cu alkyne(I) clusters, protected by all alkynyl ligands, easily form 
Cu alkyne(I) polymers, which are difficult to synthesize. The introduction of bridg-
ing ligands to jointly protect clusters can reduce the surface energy of clusters and 
improve the stability of cluster molecules in solution. This is a common strategy to 
build clusters. Since 2002 and many years after, Tasker and coworkers have investi-
gated Cu(I) clusters jointly protected by acetylene ligands and hexafluoroacetylace-
tone (Hhfac)  [72]. Through the condensation reaction of Cu2O and Hhfac, the 
synthesis of various acetylene ligands was attempted, and 16- and 20-core acetylene 
Cu(I) clusters were successfully synthesized. There are eight Cu atoms in the acety-
lene Cu(I) cluster, [Cu16(C≡CtBu)8
−(hfac)8], which forms a cage-like inner shell by 
bridging with the acetylene ligand. The other eight Cu atoms are connected with the 
hfac− ligand to form a shell. In the same year, they obtained 18-core Cu(I) clusters 
and 26-core clusters with an asymmetric disk structure by replacing HC≡CtBu with 
HC≡C-n-C3H7 [73].
Mak and coworkers conducted a systematic study on Cu(I) alkyne clusters con-
structed using templates and a comproportionation reaction [71, 74–76]. They used 
vacancy polyoxyanions with rich terminal oxygen atoms and high charge density as 
templates and synthesized four Cu clusters via a novel comproportionation-based 
synthesis route [71]. At an excitation wavelength of λ > 330 nm, the maximum emis-
sion of clusters Cu17 and Cu18 was observed at approximately 700 nm. The coordina-
tion of a polyoxometalate (POM) template with Cu(I) may affect the excited state 
from 3LMCT, and a blue shift occurred at 680 and 670 nm for the Cu33 and Cu63 
clusters, respectively (Figure 3.8b,c). They attempted to use isopropyl acetylene as 
the precursor of an acetylene ligand. The presence of Cu+ caused the isopropyl acety-
lene to induce catalytic cracking at 80 °C, thereby achieving the −C≡C− mode and 
further aggregating to form high nuclear Cu(I) clusters. Two 24- and 48-nuclear acet-
ylene Cu(I) clusters exhibit unique thermochromic luminescence properties [74].

3  Modification and Assembly of Copper Clusters

Liu and coworkers have performed extensive systematic research on Cu clusters, 
particularly in the construction of Cu hydrogen clusters with dithiophosphate and 
acetylene ligands [77–80]. They prepared two Cu alkyne clusters, and this was the 
first time mixed-valence Cu(0)/Cu(I) clusters with alkynyl protection were 
obtained [78]. They are two-electron superatomic clusters with a nuclear structure 
of [Cu13]11+. The [Cu13]11+ core of these Cu clusters exhibited a cubic octahedral 
arrangement and a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure. By reacting [Cu28H15(S2CN
nBu2)12]PF6 with Pd (PPh3)2Cl2, a Cu hydrogen cluster containing Pd0 doping, 
[PdCu14H2 (S2CNnBu2/S2P-(OiPr)2)6 (C≡CPh)6], was obtained. The structure of the 
metal core, PdCu14H2, resembles a double icosahedron, and its center is occupied by 
Pd. PdH2 is linearly encapsulated in the Cu14 core 12 S of the dithiophosphate ligand 
coordinate with 12 Cu on the top and bottom of the foot, with 6 PhC≡C− coordinate 
at the waist of the cluster.
Zhang and coworkers easily obtained Cu0 NCs with the highest nucleus. They 
exhibit an unprecedented, layered structure, providing an opportunity to visualize 
the non-FCC stacking of Cu atoms [81]. The coordination environment and evolu-
tion of the electronic structure of Cu were comprehensively characterized. Zang 
and coworkers obtained Cu(I) alkynyl NCs R/S-Cu14 with atomic accuracy and cir-
cularly polarized luminescence (CPL) performance at room temperature using chi-
ral ligands containing alkynyl and phenyl functional groups [82]. The pure CH2Cl2 
solution containing R/S-Cu14 did not exhibit PL properties. With an increase in 
n-hexane concentration, R/S-Cu14 exhibited AIE. The crystalline R/S-Cu14 cluster 
exhibited strong red emission and CPL performance from its chiral excited elec-
tronic state (Figure  3.9). The AIE and crystallization-induced emission of the 
R/S-Cu14 cluster triggered its CPL signal. They applied the AIE effect of these NCs 
to the imaging of HeLa and NG108-15 cells, and good biocompatibility was observed.

These findings reveal the origin of luminescence and chirality of Cu clusters and 
unlock a new preparation method for CPL-active metal clusters.
Zheng and coworkers successfully synthesized a 53-core mixed-valence Cu(0)/
Cu(I) cluster (ZNF/Cu53) via the combination of two reducing agents, which are 
highly soluble in Et2O and conducive to the rapid assembly of high-quality NC films 
on solid substrates [83]. The perovskite-type solar cells obtained by iodizing a Cu53 
film in situ at room temperature, and using it as a hole transport layer, exhibited a 
photoelectric conversion efficiency of 14.3%. Hyeon and coworkers reported the 
synthesis and total structure of 21-atom AgCu alloy NCs protected by alkynyl groups 
(Figure 3.10a) [84]. The Ag15Cu6 cluster demonstrated excellent catalytic activity for 
eCO2RR, with a CO Faraday efficiency (FECO) of 91.3% at −0.81 V. Furthermore, 
Ag15Cu6 exhibited superior stability with no significant decay in its current density 
and FECO during a prolonged operation of 145 hours. Hayton and coworkers synthe-
sized a 20-core Cu alkyne cluster containing 0 valence Cu (Figure 3.10b) [85]. It was 
observed that fixing the cluster on silicon dioxide can effectively catalyze a CuAAC 
reaction, and the conversion rate exceeded 90%. Compared to the unfixed clusters, 
the clusters fixed by silica did not exhibit significant structural changes before and 
after catalysis. For the first time, this study confirmed that the metal NCs protected 
by organic ligands with atomic accuracy maintain their structural integrity during 
the catalytic process. In 2020, Sun and coworkers successfully synthesized [Cu23 
(tBuC≡C)13(CF3COO)6] (recorded as SD/Cu23a) using the strategy of ladder reduc-
tion [86]. Cu23 NCs are jointly protected by CF3COO− and tBuC≡C− ligands and 
possess rare [Cu4]0 four-electron super atomic core CF3COO– ligand coordinates at 
the head and foot of the cluster (Figure 3.10c). The waist of the cluster contains 
tBuC≡C− ligand coordination. The crystals crystallized in CH2Cl2 and CHCl3 
belonged to the R3c and R space groups, respectively. The former was crystallized by 
van der Waals force and C–H⋯F interaction, whereas the latter was crystallized  
[Cu20(CCPh)12(OAc)6

by intermolecular C–H⋯Cl interaction. Different solvents can change the crystalli-
zation mode of Cu alkyne (I) NCs and make them belong to different spatial groups. 
This strategy of solvent-induced crystallization provides a synthesis method for 
various space groups of Cu alkyne (I) NCs.
3.3.4  Other Ligands Modified Copper Cluster
Short organic ligands with carboxyl groups and pyridyl have been reported as capa-
ble of protecting CuNCs [87–91]. Tilley and coworkers synthesized a series of unex-
pected multi-Cu hydride clusters, formed by the reduction of a single biCu(II) 
starting material, with silane [87]. This new Cu hydride structure provides the pos-
sibility of adjustment through the electronic property of the ligand and properties of 
the added metal center. They also appear to represent potentially useful hydride 
simulants or model Cu surface species. Interestingly, the H– reported by Tilley et al. 
exhibits different reactivities from typical Cu H–, and Cu H– plays different roles in 
different applications. Generally, this research facilitates the development of meth-
ods for multi-metal cluster catalysis. Hayton et al. prepared two Cu hydride clusters 
by reacting [(Ph3P)CuH]6 with 1,10-phenanthroline, which is the largest Cu hydride 
cluster supported by neutral donor ligands. In 2017, Liu and coworkers reported the 
synthesis and structure of the Cu16L16·2CH3COCH3 cluster (L is cyclohexyl mono-
thiocarbonate), in which the coordination solvent molecules can be easily replaced 
by other N-donor ligands through the coordination solvent substitution reac-
tion [88]. Regardless of the type of coordination solvent molecules, all the structures 
are similar. The Cu16 core can be viewed as a combination of three five-core units, 
which are arranged in a “butterfly” shape. The central five-core unit is similar to the 
pyramid; the other two units are considered butterfly patterns. The entire metal 
frame is protected. Among them, cyclohexyl monothiocarbonate ligands are com-
bined in the bridging mode.
The synthesis of atomically precise Cu NCs with high chemical stability is a pre-
requisite for practical application, but it remains a long-standing challenge. Li and 
coworkers. used a pyrazolate ligand to synthesize a Cu8 cluster [89], which exhib-
ited exceptional chemical stability in the solid or solution state (Figure 3.11). The 
Cu8 cluster demonstrates good stability in boiling water, 8 wt% H2O2, highly concen-
trated acids (1 M HCl), or saturated bases. With high alkali resistance, Cu8 exhibits 
excellent catalytic activity for the synthesis of indolizine, which can be reused for at 
least 10 cycles without losing its catalytic performance.
Hayton and coworkers obtained a Cu hydride nanocluster (NC) [Cu29Cl4H22(Ph2
phen)12]Cl (2, Ph2phen = 4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline) in good yields [90], by 
controlled growth from the smaller NC, [Cu25H22(PPh3)12]Cl (1), in the presence of 
Ph2phen and a chloride source at room temperature. In 2, the central core of 13 Cu 
atoms is arranged in a centered icosahedron, which is the same as that of the precur-
sor cluster 1. The Cu13 core in 2 is connected, via Cu−Cu bonds, to four triangular 
[Cu4(Ph2phen)3(Cl)] motifs, which cap the icosahedron in a tetrahedral arrange-
ment, with 4 [CuCl] units at the vertices of a tetrahedron, and 12 [Cu(Ph2phen)] 
units distributing around the cluster in six π-stacked pair. Formation of 2 by cluster

expansion of 1 requires both the complete exchange of 12 Ph3P ligands by 12 
Ph2phen ligands and the addition of 4 “CuCl” units to the Cu25 core. The rapid 
ligand exchange process occurs in two stages. First, rapid ligand exchange with 
Ph2phen results in the formation of [Cu25H22(PPh3)12−n(Ph2phen)n]Cl. This unsta-
ble intermediate then reacts sequentially with four “CuCl” units to generate com-
plex 2. The “CuCl” units are presumably derived from a reaction between a sacrificial 
molecule of [Cu25H22(PPh3)12−n(Ph2phen)n]Cl and the CH2Cl2 solvent, releasing 
“CuCl” monomers and forming CH3Cl. Importantly, only a small fraction of 
[Cu25H22(PPh3)12−n(Ph2phen)n]Cl is required to form the required “CuCl” mono-
mers, since just one cluster can supply 25 equiv of “CuCl.” The slower extrusion of 
CuCl monomer, its transport, and subsequent capture by intact clusters resemble 
elementary steps in the reactant-assisted Ostwald ripening of metal NPs. This mech-
anism could be applicable to other nanocluster systems and suggests a new strategy 
to manipulate metal NCs.
Utilizing low-valent organoelement species RB as ligands at transition-metal (A) 
centers (R  =  CH3, bulky alkyl, aryl, and Cp*  =  C5Me5; B  =  low-valent Group 
12/13 metal) is also an effective synthesis strategy in constructing metal-rich mole-
cules. Among such ligands, a versatile and powerful donor ligand carbenoid Cp*Al, 
which is similar to the role of CO in metal carbonyl clusters, has been selected to 
stabilize larger transition-metal cores. Fischer and coworkers reported an Al–Cu 
intermetalloid cluster [(Cp*AlCu)6H4] (1), which is obtained by the reaction of 
[(Cp*Al)4] and [(Ph3PCuH)6] [91]. The stronger affinity of Cp*Al towards Cu sweeps 
the phosphine ligands from the Cu hydride precursor and furnishes an octahedral 
Al6 cage to encapsulate the Cu6 core adopting a bicapped tetrahedral cluster struc-
ture being wrapped into a hydrocarbon shell of Cp* and H ligands only. The result-
ing hydrido cluster M12H4 reacts with benzonitrile to give the stoichiometric 
hydrometalation product [(Cp*AlCu)6H3(N═CHPh)] (2, -). In the synthesis process 
of [(Cp*AlCu)6H4], the critical step for aggregation is not just the PPh3 substitution 
itself, but rather the elimination of H2 as the ideal leaving group, thus creating 
unsaturated Cu0.
3.3.5  Assembly of Copper Clusters
The stability of cluster materials is the main factor limiting their research and appli-
cation. Assembling clusters into cluster-based assembly materials with rigid organic 
linkers is effective for improving the stability of cluster materials  [92–95]. 
Demessence and coworkers prepared a Cu thiolate coordination polymer, which 
shows luminescence thermochromism related to the unprecedented intrinsic triple 
emission [92]. This compound holds substantial promise as a self-reference lumi-
nous thermometer, and its operating temperature range is 93–503 K. Zang and 
­coworkers used a Cu12 cluster as a precursor and bipyridine as a linker to construct 
a Cu thiolate cluster-assembled material(Cu12-bpy) [93], which outperformed other 
reported counterparts with high Cu azide (CA) contents (89.43%), remarkable flame 
ignition ability (H50 ≥ 60 cm), and good electrostatic safety. The micro-initiating 
device, fabricated using CA-heteroatom-doped porous carbon hybrids, exhibited an 

﻿  ­Reference
85
ultrafast energy-release rate and extremely low input ignition energy. Robinson and 
coworkers obtained a superstable and conductive sulfur bridge [Cu4–Cu5–Cu4] clus-
ter with a cap-core-cap structure  [94]. The cluster contained sulfur–metal, and 
metal–metal bonds, which are the sources of many outstanding chemical/physical 
properties. Interestingly, the cap and core components in the cluster have their 
clockwise or counterclockwise directions; however, only two chiral-specific enanti-
omeric clusters were produced. Hydrogen bonds and intermolecular interactions 
lead to a more complex hierarchical assembly comprising alternating enantiomers.
3.4  ­Conclusion and Perspectives
Nanomaterials with various structures, shapes, and morphologies hold application 
potential because of their outstanding properties. CuNCs have significant applica-
tions in catalysis, biological imaging, and sensing. To discover a better, cheaper, and 
more stable catalyst, and synthesize high-fluorescence, stable, and biocompatible 
nanodyes that can be commercialized and applied in daily clinical diagnoses, 
CuNCs must be improved. There is still a lot of room for improvement. However, 
through the joint efforts of experimental and theoretical research, we can synthe-
size, design, and manufacture CuNC-based universal catalytic reaction catalysts. 
Regarding the sensing probe, there is still room for improvement to ensure high 
sensitivity and selectivity to toxic analytes and ensure a safe and protected environ-
ment. Although CuNC-based fluorescent probes occasionally exhibit remarkable 
sensitivity, they have never been commercialized and applied to clinical practice. 
Finally, for biomedical applications, it is necessary to use biocompatible and non-
toxic fluorescent dyes to detect pathogens and disease markers to promote clinical 
diagnosis, particularly in the early stages of diseases. Although a substantial amount 
of work has been conducted in this field, research is still ongoing.

4.1  ­Introduction
Polyoxometalates (POMs) are discrete metal oxide clusters of Mo, W, V, Nb, and Ta 
with variable structures, sub‐nanometer size, and widespread applications in photo-
chemistry, catalysis, electronics, electrochemistry, and medicine [1–7]. Since the first 
POMs, (NH4)3[PMo12O40] (PMo12), reported by Berzelius in 1826, the POMs chemis-
try, a special branch of coordination chemistry, has aroused wide attention with the 
development of structure characterization technology [8]. Especially with the spread 
and maturity of single X‐ray diffraction, the atomically precise structure of POMs can 
be definitely confirmed. The topological structures of Keggin, Anderson, Dawson, 
Waugh, Silverton, Lindqvist, and Strandberg have been discovered sequentially and 
formed into the seven basic structures of POMs [9] (Figure 4.1). Other than noble 
metal clusters, the oxygen‐enriched surface and rich substitutional chemistry of 
POMs enable the insertion of active sites and chemical modifications. POMs‐based 
organic–inorganic hybrids can be categorized into two classifications ­according to 
the interactions between organic moieties and POMs: classification I (non‐­covalent 
interactions) and classification II (covalent interactions) [10, 11].
POM‐based organic–inorganic hybrids (I) are assembled by ionic bond, hydrogen 
bonding as well as/or intermolecular force, while classification II is formed through 
covalent grafting organic moieties onto POMs surface by replacing the oxygen atoms 
in POM clusters. Other than noble metal clusters, POM‐based organic–inorganic 
hybrids (II) gained intensive attention and dramatic development since the covalent 
organic modification of POMs could incorporate POMs with advanced functional 
organic moieties on their surfaces in a reliable and predefined manner. Through 
surface modification, POM clusters can exist as soluble macroanions in many sol-
vent systems and may not follow the solution behaviors of their inorganic nanocrys-
tal counterparts. These hold promise for the development of molecular hybrid 
materials that bridge the gap between organic moieties and inorganic POM clusters. 
Moreover, the structure and properties of POM cluster‐based assemblies can be 
tuned precisely via cluster building units at molecular level, creating a distinct

shortcut of the structure‐property relationship for colloidal nanomaterials. Over the 
last few decades, vast efforts have been made mainly toward the discovery of new 
POM clusters such as the incorporation of metal ions, covalent modification, and 
bridging of POM clusters, as well as their potential applications  [12–14]. These 
researches focus on the synthesis of novel POM clusters and their modifications at 
molecular level, while their fabrication into materials is relatively less mentioned. 
In this regard, the self‐assembly of POM clusters into advanced materials maintains 
a cornucopia for further exploration.
The anionic giant POM clusters are able to form large, aggregated structures slowly 
in aqueous solution, even though they are highly soluble. In 2000, Müller and 
­coworkers first reported the formation of spherical aggregates assembled by “giant 
molecular wheels [15].” It was later corroborated that a series of giant POM clusters, 
such as Mo154, Mo132, Mo72Fe30, Mo72Cr30, Mo72V30, and Cu20P4W48, would self‐
assemble into “blackberry” structures after a slow assembly process lasting from a 
few days to months [16–19]. Generally speaking, the bare POM clusters are hydro-
philic, owing to their highly negatively charged nature and oxygen‐enriched surface, 
which is incompatible with organic solvent systems. In view of this, covalent organic 
functionalization has been proven to be an effective strategy to make the design of 
advanced functional materials more rational in order to conquer recent challenges in 
cutting‐edge fields including catalysis, material, energy, and biology. In this review, 
we will focus on the recent advances in the controlled assembly of surfactant‐­
encapsulated POM clusters and their co‐assembly with inorganic entities in terms of 
the current synthetic strategies, structural overviews, and applications in the cutting‐
edge fields of catalysis, material science, energy, and biomedicines.
4.2  ­Synthetic Strategies and Structural Overviews
Since the first formation of quaternary ammonium derivatives, POMs were reported 
by Venturello in 1983 [20]. These researches, together with other parallel results, as 
well as POM‐based coordination polymers (also written as POM‐based metal‐organic

frameworks [MOFs] in some articles), opened up a new field for the assembly of 
POM clusters [21–29]. In this section, synthetic strategies and structural overviews 
will be categorized into three parts, surfactant‐encapsulated POM clusters, assembly 
of Janus POM‐POSS co‐clusters, and POM‐based coordination polymers, according 
to the different modifications of POM clusters.
4.2.1  Surfactant-Encapsulated POM Clusters
The surfactant‐encapsulated POMs (SEPs) cover both small and giant clusters and 
can be prepared through simple synthetic approaches, resulting in various morphol-
ogies in different dimensions. In 2005, Wu et al. first achieved the POM‐based archi-
tectures built by DODA (dimethyl dioctadecyl ammonium) and Keggin‐type 
[Eu(H2O)2SiW11O39]8− clusters  [30]. The surfactant‐encapsulated clusters can 
aggregate into vesicles in chloroform solution, and when cast onto solid supports 
form honeycomb structures that range in micrometer sizes. Liu et al. also realized 
the highly ordered honeycomb architectures at the air‐water interface constructed 
by DODA and “Keplerate” giant clusters by tuning the concentration of the sur-
factant [31]. Another remarkable work was published subsequently, which studied 
onion‐like lamellar spherical assemblies with (DODA)4SiW12O40 by phase transfor-
mation (Figure 4.2) [32]. By controlling the volume ratio of chloroform/methanol,

the stability and uniformity can be tuned. In this work, the authors confirm that 
SEPs have a general tendency to form spherical aggregates in organic solvents, 
which is attributed to the rearrangement of surfactants on the exterior of the POM.
In addition to this, Wang’s group developed a new solvent system, chloroform‐n‐
butanol, to fabricate monodispersed POM cluster‐based assemblies under solvo-
thermal conditions  [33]. Disk‐like, cone‐like, and tubular assemblies with high 
uniformity are obtained, and the self‐assembly process is illustrated in Figure 4.3a, 
b. Different from the typical synthesis, the morphology of these assemblies can rap-
idly transfer into cone‐like structures by altering the solvent ratio to 2 : 1 (chloroform/ 
butanol). Tubular assemblies can be formed by simply aging the cones in the solvent 
environment for days. These structures, including disks, cones, and tubes, are char-
acterized as lamellar constructions with layer spacing of about 2.9 nm. It was found 
that tubular assemblies will turn back into disks and cones by changing the ratio of 
chloroform/butanol to 3 : 1 and 2 : 1, respectively. The reversible assembly behavior 
may be driven by the hybrid clusters’ amphiphilic nature and their possible rear 
arrangement around the POM surface under particular solvent conditions to achieve 
maximum thermodynamic stability.
And then, in 2010, Wang’s group presented the polyoxometalate supramolecular 
nano‐building blocks‐based well‐defined and robust rose, snowlike, and ice ball 
architectures by simple but effective exploitation of noncovalent interactions in the 
reaction system (Figure 4.4) [34]. All structures begin from the formation of disk 
assemblies that act as a foundation for the construction of diverse, well‐defined 
architectures. The rose, snow flowers, and ice balls, and the corresponding growth 
mechanisms are unambiguously demonstrated by collecting and analyzing inter-
mediate morphologies. Different assembly shapes show interesting hydrophilic and 
hydrophobic surface properties which may provide opportunities to develop more 
suitable functional materials for different systems to overcome the polarity restric-
tions. All assemblies formed through the precise order and successive organization

of polyoxometalate nano‐supramolecules in a lamellar pattern that may be prompted 
or slowed down by controlling the ambient temperature of the reaction system.
Since the outer shell of SEP assemblies is covered by organic surface ligand, the 
symmetry of these ligands may exert a marked effect on the POM cluster assem-
blies, particularly for their dimensionality in consideration of the steric effect. In 
this section, Wang’s group provided a new strategy for the desulfurization and pro-
duction of environmentally clean petroleum fuel. Meanwhile, these amphiphilic 
POM building blocks show interesting self‐assembly behavior at room temperature 
and uniform POM‐based nanowires and nanotubes have been obtained, the struc-
tures of which depend greatly on the length of the alkyl chain in the surfactant. 
Figure 4.5 demonstrates schematically the approach for the preparation of amphi-
philic POM assembly structures, and the concept of enhanced catalytic efficiency of 
POM in the mesostructures [35]. The interactions between POM clusters and sur-
face ligands in SEP assemblies are not all about electrostatic attractions. In some 
cases, the quaternary ammoniums can be replaced by oleylamine, which is electri-
cally neutral and often acts as a surface ligand in the synthesis of inorganic sys-
tems [36]. Oleylamine, oleic acid, and Na2HPW12O40·2H2O are used as surfactants 
and POM precursors, respectively, and the reaction is performed under solvother-
mal conditions. Nanoroll structures (Figure 4.6a) are obtained at the early stage 
of the reaction and can transform into single‐walled nanotubes (Figure 4.6b) com-
pletely as the reaction temperature and reaction time increases. The structural detail

study and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy substantiate the existence 
of the oleylamine group in both nanorolls and nanotubes. Small‐angle X‐ray diffrac-
tion (SAXRD) results indicate similar periodic distances between POM clusters in 
the nanorolls and nanotubes, which are 3.8 and 3.9 nm, respectively (Figure 4.6c). 
The above results imply that double‐chain surfactants favor the formation of 3D 
SEP assemblies while single‐chain surfactants prefer the 1D structures.
One distinct feature of cluster‐assembled materials that differs from conventional 
nanocrystals is the discrete building blocks with extremely small sizes. If the assem-
bly process is strictly confined to one dimension or two dimensions, the ultrathin 
POM assemblies with unique properties may be fabricated. In 2013, Wang’s group 
achieved a supramolecular gel by the self‐assembly of surfactant‐encapsulated 
Wells–Dawson POM in the butanone and ethyl acetate system, which shows photo‐
responsive thermos and photo‐responsive properties [37]. The component of SEPs 
is characterized as (CTA)3 (TBA)3P2W18O62. Characterized by transmission electron 
microscopy (TEM) images (Figure 4.7a,b), the structure is built with nanowires of 
different diameters. The gels can be further polymerized if unsaturated esters are 
used and subsequently electrospinned into nanowires and non‐woven mats. The 
as‐prepared non‐woven mats have Young’s modulus as high as 542.55 MPa. It is 
believed that this supramolecular gel is a good platform for POM processing.

4.2  ­Syntheti c Strategie s a nd Structural  Overview
99
The self‐assembly of SEPs is commonly driven by weak interactions between 
POM building blocks, surfactants, and other surroundings. These driving forces, 
involving electrostatic interaction, van der Waals forces, hydrogen bonding, coordi-
nation bonding, and solvophobic interaction are usually of the same order of mag-
nitude in energy, which may all contribute to the formation of SEP assemblies. To 
achieve precise control of SEP assemblies, including their assembly behaviors as 
well as properties, we need to look inside the structures at molecular level and 
investigate carefully the role of each molecule, or even atom, in the assemblies. In 
2019, Wang’s group developed a system for the bottom‐up fabrication of single‐­
cluster assemblies and the control over their assembly behavior at molecular level 
(Figure 4.8) [24]. In this sense, this work for the first time reveals the control of the 
assembly behaviors and properties of nanomaterials by stepwise tuning of interac-
tions at molecular level and illustrates the universal functionality of single‐cluster 
assemblies. More importantly, the control of cluster assemblies at the molecular 
level may uncover the chemical logic inside inorganic materials and realize the

4.2.2  Assembly of Janus POM-POSS Co-clusters
The concept of “Janus” stands for a 3D dissymmetrical distribution of the chemical 
or physical features including size, shape, chemical composition, and surface prop-
erties. The Janus entities are able to self‐organize into hierarchically ordered struc-
tures with diverse functionalities [38–41], providing intriguing alternatives for the 
fabrication of cluster‐assembled materials. So far, the atomically precise Janus clus-
ters have been realized with various compositions through multiple‐step synthesis. 
Among them, polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes (POSSs) are most commonly 
used for their tunable size and unique surface properties. The idea of combining 
POM and POSS clusters into Janus clusters via a short organic tether for the con-
struction of supramolecular structures was first proposed by Wang’s group in 
2013. [42, 43] The Janus POM‐POSS co‐clusters reflect different solubility in differ-
ent parts, whereby the POM cluster prefers polar solvents and the POSS cluster dis-
solves well in non‐polar solvents. In this case, the Janus clusters may be incompatible 
in a mixed solvent system and tend to self‐assemble into superstructures under con-
trolled conditions. To reach this goal, these researchers synthesized dumbbell‐
shaped hybrid clusters containing a Wells‐Dawson‐type POM cluster (Bu4N+)6H3 
[P2W15V3O62]9− and aminopropylisobutyl‐POSS cluster coupled covalently through 
an organic tether (Figure 4.9a). In the initial work by Wang’s group, a thin film is

clusters are arranged in an orderly fashion with 1.38‐nm periodicity. The electro-
static interactions between POM‐POSS are strongly influenced by the solvent polar-
ity, which appears to show different assembly behaviors in different solvent systems. 
Thus, the morphology evolution of the co‐cluster assemblies is performed in the 
acetone/n‐hexane solution, as illustrated in Figure 4.9c [44].
As the symmetry of the co‐cluster alters, their assembly behavior may change 
accordingly. In 2014, Wang’s group designed a new type of V‐shaped POM‐ 2POSS 
cluster constructed by the same POM and POSS units [45]. By solvent evaporation 
in acetonitrile, the Janus cluster can slowly self‐assemble into lamellar structures 
with a periodic of 5.1 nm characterized by X‐ray diffraction and TEM. Later, they 
synthesized another POM‐ABPOSS cluster, which is formed by POM, heptaphenyl 
POSS, and heptaisobutyl POSS clusters [46]. In an acetone/water mixture, the Janus 
clusters could aggregate into colloidal onions with a wide‐ranging size distribution, 
and the onion‐like structure could reach up to 100 nm with 18 layers.
In the most recent work, a novel cluster was designed (Figure 4.10a,b) in which one 
POM cluster and four POSS clusters are covalently linked through organic tethers to 
reach a wedge‐shaped building block [47]. The 2D honeycomb superlattice via self‐
assembly of a planar building block with a well‐controlled shape, containing two types 
of covalently linked organo‐functionalized inorganic clusters. Electron microscopy has 
revealed single‐ and multilayer self‐assembled sheets with a diversity of graphene‐like 
stacking modes, albeit on an order‐of‐magnitude larger length scale (Figure 4.10c,d).
Other types of POM clusters, also selected to construct Janus clusters and their 
assembly behaviors in colloidal solutions, were investigated mainly by Cheng’s 
group [48, 49]. Lindqvist‐POSS hybrid clusters, whose size is 3.0 nm in long axis and 
1.1 nm in short axis, can assemble into 2D nanosheets with a thickness of 5.7 ± 0.2 nm 
in diluted acetonitrile solution through evaporation. This representative progress 
helps us to look deeper into the nature of cluster‐based assembly and may enlighten 
the bottom‐up fabrication of nanomaterials with unique properties from a novel 
perspective. However, the research on self‐assembly of Janus POM‐POSS co‐­clusters 
is still at the early stage of development and new discoveries regarding POM‐POSS 
cluster assemblies, especially for their potential applications, are still needed.
4.2.3  Porous POM-Based Metal–Organic Framework (MOF)  
Materials
Polyoxometalate (POM)‐based MOF materials contain POM units and generally 
generate MOF materials with open networks. POM‐based MOF materials, which 
utilize the advantages of both POMs and MOFs, have received increasing attention, 
and much effort has been devoted to their preparation and relevant applications 
over the past few decades [50, 51]. They have good prospects in catalysis owing to 
the electronic and physical properties of POMs that are tunable by varying constitu-
ent elements.
In 2007, Yang’s group extended the preparation of transition‐metal‐substituted 
polyoxotungstates (POTs) by a conventional aqueous solution method to the 
­hydrothermal technique. A series of novel Ni6‐substituted POTs, [Ni6(μ3‐OH)3

enMe; en = ethylenediamine, enMe = 1,2‐diaminopropane), were isolated by study-
ing the new reaction systems containing vacant POM precursors, metal ions, and 
organic amines under hydrothermal conditions [52]. The Ni6‐substituted POTs are 
composed of rich terminal water ligands with different orientations, which offers 
the possibility of making new derivatives by replacing the water ligands with other 
inorganic or organic groups. They introduced various rigid carboxylate ligands into 
the well‐defined hydrothermal systems for in situ generation of Ni6‐substituted 
POTs and successfully isolated three POM‐based MOF compounds (Figure 4.11) [53]. 
As a continuation of their work, tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (denoted as 
Tris) was successfully grafted onto the surface of Ni6‐substituted POTs formed in 
situ to further generate a 3‐connected building block. The cooperative assembly of 
Tris functionalized 3‐connected building blocks and 1,3,5‐H3btc results in a cubic 
POM‐organic molecular cage with high thermal and hydrothermal stability. [54] 
The key points of the synthetic procedures have been well established, which indi-
cates that this strategy offers an effective and feasible way for designing and making 
new POM‐based MOF materials [7].

As is known, POMs are comprised of early‐transition metal with d0 or d1 electronic 
configurations. The metal oxide clusters entirely consisting of late transition metal 
ions with d10 electronic configuration are rarely available owing to the instability of 
extremely high negative charge. Compared with conventional POM clusters, d10 
metal–oxygen clusters may have some special properties resulting from the inherent 
characteristics of late transition metals. In this sense, how to lower the overall nega-
tive charge to obtain d10 metal–oxygen clusters is a significant and challenging task 
in synthetic chemistry and material science. Lan and Su et al. employed a semirigid 
ligand containing eight carboxyl groups, 5,5′‐(2,2‐bis((3,5‐dicarboxyphenoxy) 
methyl) propane‐1,3‐diyl) bis(oxy) diisophthalic acid (L1), to study the system of 
crystalline catalysts containing d10 metal–oxygen clusters. Fortunately, an unprece-
dented 3D hetero polyoxozincate organic compound with (3,4,24)‐­connected ddy 
topology, [Zn16(HPO3)4]L1
3 (IFMC‐200), has been isolated, which is the first exam-
ple of a 24‐connected node constructed from a single d10 metal cluster 
(Figure 4.12) [55]. The new strategy with “carboxyl group‐stabilized polyoxozincate

cluster” mode helped to lower the overall negative charge and successfully proved 
that it is an efficient method to isolate a late transition metal–oxygen cluster.
In 2015, Lan’s group synthesized two stable {Zn‐ɛ‐Keggin}‐based POMOFs, 
[TBA]3[ɛ‐PMoV

4‐O37(OH)3Zn4][BPT](NENU‐501, BPT = [1,1′‐
biphenyl]‐3,4′,5‐tricarboxylate) [56]. Both of them showed high structural stability in 
air as well as tolerance to acidic and basic media, as shown in Figure 4.13. In 2019, 
Lan’s group selected 1,2,4‐triazole (trz) as an organic molecule because of its vital role 
in affinity enhancement and charge transfer; thus, two new [PW12O40]3−‐based Cu‐trz 
MOFs were successfully fabricated through pH transformation, formulated as 
[Cu18(trz)12Cl3(H2O)2][PW12O40] (Cu18PW12) and [CuI
2CuII
4(trz)8Cl2] [PW12O40] 
(Cu6PW12). Then, the POMOF/SWNT nanocomposites (PMNTs) were prepared by 
employing a simple sonication‐driven periodic functionalization strategy. The results 
of the peroxidase‐mimicking catalytic activity evaluation of PMNTs indicate that the 
integration of SWNTs and POMOFs greatly enhanced the peroxidase‐mimicking 
activity because of the short interactions between POMOFs and SWNTs and the 
higher affinity of PMNTs with substrates. Most importantly, a simple, highly sensitive, 
and selective “on−off switch” colorimetric approach for L‐Cys detection has been

developed (Figure 4.14) [57]. Note that the PMNT nanocomposite exhibits the best 
performance among all reported materials as L‐Cys colorimetric biosensors to date.
Based on the extensive work reported above, it has been a great challenge to pre-
pare stable MOF materials with suitable pore sizes to be employed as carriers and 
the choice of MOF carriers needs to be explored. We also anticipate that more MOFs 
will act as carriers and more POMs with different functions have potential in the 
preparation of POM‐loaded MOF materials and that more POM‐loaded MOF mate-
rials may perhaps not only be employed as heterogeneous catalysts in various 
organic reactions but also be used in other fields, such as proton conductivity and 
capacitors, in the future.

4.3  ­Applications
POMs are an exceptional family of anionic metal oxide clusters based on the early 
transition metal ions (e.g. Mo, W, V) at their highest oxidation states connected by 
oxygen atoms. POM clusters with the precise atomic structures have widespread 
applications in electrochemistry and electrocatalysis, photocatalytic, asymmetric 
catalysis, biology, etc. [1, 58–63]. The oxygen‐rich surface and abundant substitution 
chemistry of POM clusters can insert active sites and modifications through covalent 
or non‐covalent interactions. Moreover, the structure and performance of the assem-
bly based on POM clusters can be precisely adjusted through sub‐­nanometer build-
ing blocks at the molecular level. Up to now, POM cluster‐based assemblies have 
obtained diverse structures and unique properties, which have been attracting 
increasing attention [12–14, 64, 65].

asymmetric catalysts. Asymmetric catalysis is one of the most important properties 
in the POM cluster‐based assembly family, which plays a vital role in the synthesis 
of pharmaceuticals and in the field of organic reactions [68, 69].
It is a very effective method to construct POM‐based asymmetric catalyst with 
high catalytic efficiency and stereoselectivity by using chiral organic groups to 
encapsulate achiral POM. In 2020, Song’s group reported a kind of two‐dimensional 
POM asymmetric assemblies through a controllable and effective step‐by‐step strat-
egy (exfoliation, covalent modification, and reassembly) (Figure 4.15) [70]. The chi-
rality of POM‐based nanostructures was induced using the l‐ or d‐pyrrolidine‐type 
chiral ionic liquid. The chiral ionic liquid may be seen as a special cationic sur-
factant to some extent. The chiral POM‐based enantiomers showed excellent cata-
lytic properties in the enantioselective epoxidation of allylic alcohols reaction 
including catalytic yield, efficiency, chemical selectivity, and enantioselectivity 
compared to the unconfined POM‐based catalysts. At the same time, turnover fre-
quency (TOF) and enantioselectivity values of the constructed chiral POM‐based 
enantiomers catalysts can be up to 240 hours and 93% for the asymmetric epoxida-
tion of allylic alcohols, respectively.
The introduction of POM components into the hierarchical framework structures 
may be able to obtain various novel structures and enrich their functions, which offers 
a promising method for the synergistic combination of inorganic and organic catalytic 
units [71]. In 2013, Duan and coworkers reported the preparation of two novel enan-
tiomer catalysts, by incorporating oxidation catalyst [BW12O40]5− anion and chiral 
pyrrolidine ligand catalytic units into one single metal framework in a one‐pot synthe-
sis (Figure 4.16). The constructed chiral POM‐based enantiomers were synthesized by 
the solvothermal reaction of Ni2H[BW12O40] and 4,4‐bipyridine with the chiral group 
l‐ or d‐tert‐butoxycarbonyl‐2‐(imidazole)‐1‐pyrrolidine. The simultaneous existence 
of polyoxometalate oxidants and chiral guidance agents in confined space can offer a 
special amphiphilic microenvironment for the construction of asymmetric reaction

intermediates in a highly stereoselective fashion. Moreover, in a heterogeneous sys-
tem, the catalytic properties of the chiral POM‐based enantiomers for asymmetric 
dihydroxylation in the presence of dichloromethane were explored by the use of aque-
ous hydrogen peroxide and styrene. More importantly, the chiral POM‐based enanti-
omers displayed high enantioselectivitis for (R)‐phenyl‐1,2‐ethanediol (ee > 95%).
In the follow‐up work, Duan and coworkers reported the design and synthesis  
of two homochiral POM‐based homochiral MOFs (Figure 4.17) [72]. In the pres-
ence of acetonitrile and H2O, the chiral structures were assembled through the 
­solvothermal reaction of Keggin‐type [ZnW12O40]6 anions, Zn(NO3)2·6H2O, chiral

N‐tert‐butoxy‐carbonyl‐2‐(imidazole)‐1‐pyrrolidine, and NH2‐functionalized bridg-
ing links, NH2‐bipyridine. Here, by incorporating Keggin‐type polyoxometalate ani-
ons as an oxidation catalyst and pyrrolidine‐2‐yl‐imidazole as an asymmetric 
organocatalyst, POM‐based homochiral MOFs showed excellent asymmetric cata-
lytic activities for the asymmetric coupling epoxide with CO2. More interestingly, the 
structure can be used as a tandem catalyst to effectively convert CO2 into value‐added 
enantiomeric pure cyclic carbonate in a single workup procedure. In addition, for the 
target (R)‐phenyl (ethylene carbonate), the desired product was achieved with a yield 
of 92% and an ee value of 79%. The structure data of POM‐based homochiral MOFs 
clearly displayed that the noncovalent interaction between Keggin‐type [ZnW12O40]6 
and chiral pyrrolidine‐2‐yl‐imidazole, as well as the potential π–π interaction between 
the imidazole ring and the phenyl ring of the (R) or (S)‐ styrene oxide are the main 
factors for the stereoselective conversion of olefins to epoxides.
4.3.2  POM-Based Nanostructures for Electrochemistry 
and Electrocatalysis
In order to obtain catalysts with high efficiency, high selectivity, and easy availabil-
ity, POM‐based catalysts have been attracting immense attention due to their struc-
tural and chemical diversity [3, 73, 74], the ability to show the stable and tunable 
oxidation‐reduction properties [61], and the good compatibility of building func-
tional materials [75]. As is known to all, POM‐based nanostructures with tunable 
compositions can donate/accept more elections reversibly for multielectron reduc-
tion processes. Consequently, many electrochemical and electrocatalytic studies on 
POM‐based nanostructures have been conducted.
In 2015, Zhou and coworkers reported the design and synthesis of two new three‐
dimensional POM‐based MOFs, namely, [TBA]3[ε‐PMoV
8MoVI
4O36(OH)4Zn4]
[BTB]4/3·xGuest and [TBA]3[ε‐PMoV
8MoVI
4O37(OH)3Zn4] [BPT] (NENU‐500 and 
NENU‐501, BPT = [1,1′‐biphenyl]‐3,4′,5‐tricarboxylate, BTB = benzene tribenzo-
ate, TBA+ = tetrabutylammonium ion), which possessed good structural stability 
and had strong receiving ability in acidic and basic media (Figure 4.18)[56]. The 
structure of the three‐dimensional porous POM‐based MOF was composed of 
organic linkers and POM anions structural nodes. In addition, the TBA+ ions are 
located in the open channels and are used to balance the charges of the POM‐based 
MOFs. Remarkably, NENU‐500 has been shown to afford excellent activity for the 
hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) under acidic conditions among the MOF mate-
rials, due to the combination of the advantages of the porosity of the framework 
structure and POM units. Furthermore, the catalytic current density of NENU‐500 
can reach 10 mA cm−2 with a low overpotential of 237 mV.
In addition, POM‐based nanostructures, as efficient homogeneous or heterogene-
ous catalysts, displayed great potential to promote the electrical energy‐driven CO2 
reduction, including the reduction of CO2 into value‐added fuels or even multielec-
tron reduction of CO2 to useful chemicals. In 2018, a series of stable and atomically 
precise POM‐based organic frameworks [PMoV

CO2 reduction properties, have been reported by Lan and coworkers (Figure 4.19)[76]. 
These single crystals of POM‐based organic frameworks  were prepared by similar in 
situ hydrothermal reactions and showed iso‐reticular structures. The structure of  
the POM‐based organic frameworks was composed of tetrakis[4‐carboxyphenyl]‐­
porphyrin‐M organic linkers and reductive POM clusters building blocks. The inte-
gration of electrocatalytic active metalloporphyrin and reductive POM unit in the 
POM‐based organic framework can generate a directional electronic transportation 
channel, which is conducive to the realization of the multiple electrons transfer in 
the CO2 reduction reaction. In particular, the Co‐PMOF displayed the best catalytic 
performances among all target POM‐based organic frameworks, which can selec-
tively achieve the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CO with a superior faradaic 
efficiency of 99% and good catalysis durability of more than 36 hours. The turnover 
frequency of Co‐PMOF can reach up to 1656 h−1.
POM‐based nanostructures may be used as anode materials to promote the 
­performance of lithium‐ion batteries owing to their electron‐storage properties. In 
2018, Lan’s group prepared single crystals that were characterized by a novel  
POM‐based organic framework with a three‐dimensional net, namely, [PMo8

performance of as‐synthesized POM‐based organic framework for lithium‐ion batter-
ies was explored. Of note, the obtained compound displayed a highly reversible capac-
ity of 750 mAh g−1 and excellent cycle stability. In addition, it was found that the 
intermolecular π–π stacking interactions of the obtained POM‐based organic frame-
work are conducive to improving the properties of lithium‐ion batteries.

that these compounds are isomorphous. Furthermore, due to the combination of 
advantages of POMs, with electron‐storage properties and MOFs with high surface 
areas together, the as‐prepared compounds with novel structures have displayed

good stable performance in lithium‐ion batteries as anode materials. In addition, 
by encapsulating ionic liquids (ILs) into POM‐based organic frameworks, a series 
of ILs‐functionalized MOFs were prepared, which displayed excellent perfor-
mances for lithium‐ion batteries. Such outstanding behaviors were mainly ascribed 
to the synergistic effects of ILs and POM‐based organic frameworks [79].
POMs have been proven to be capable of preparing functional hybrid materials as 
multifunctional inorganic building units due to the tunable molecular structures of 
their diverse properties. In 2022, Li and coworkers reported that anionic monolacu-
nary [SiW11O39]8− clusters can be accurately anchored into the anionic Nafion nano-
phase in the form of a hybrid amphiphile by a supramolecular assembly method 
(Figure 4.22) [80]. On the basis of the [SiW11O39]8− moiety with a high number of 
counterions, alkynyl anions were successfully attached to the clusters under basic 
conditions, polyethylene glycol silane chains were successfully grafted onto the 
[SiW11O39]8− moiety to lead to the formation of the hybrid POM amphiphile. The 
amphiphilic property of the polyethylene glycol grafted polyoxometalate is caused 
by the difference in the hydrophilic property of inorganic and organic parts of 
the  amphiphilic property of the polyethylene glycol grafted polyoxometalate.

The hydrated membranes were synthesized through a facile solution‐casting strat-
egy. Interestingly, typical mechanical enhancement of hybrid membranes caused by 
polyethylene glycol grafted polyoxometalate incorporation into Nafion ionic nano-
phase through noncovalent immobilization methods. In addition, such ­hydrophobic 
interaction and hydrogen bonding interaction make the cross‐linking characteristic 
of Nafion phase. Furthermore, a series of experimental results revealed that the 
content of the polyethylene glycol grafted polyoxometalate plays a crucial role in 
their proton‐conducting effect. Compared to the pristine Nafion, the as‐prepared 
proton exchange hybrid membranes based on POM clusters achieved comprehen-
sive improvement in fuel cell power density.

POM clusters can be connected through non‐covalent interactions to form cluster‐
based assemblies encapsulated by surface ligands. The cluster‐based assemblies fabri-
cated by sub‐nanometer building blocks of POM clusters have the potential to display 
enhanced catalytic properties and stability owing to the multiple interactions between 
building blocks of POM clusters and surrounding parts. Wang and coworkers have 
successfully synthesized a wide variety of POM‐based assemblies with diverse and 
advanced properties by multiple non‐covalent interactions (Figure 4.23) [81–85]. In 
2022, Wang and coworkers reported that the visible‐light‐induced 1D nanowire super-
structures are based on POM and Ag clusters [86]. The nanowire was synthesized by 
two‐phase approach. Employment of different types of POM clusters such as 
[P2W17O61]10−, [P2W15O56]12−or [EuW10O36]9−, in the presence of visible light resulted in 
the formation of the POM‐Ag cluster co‐assembly. In this process, the alkyl chain of 
surface ligand influenced the formation of the cluster‐based assemblies to some extent. 
The silver clusters are formed by the in situ reduction of Ag+, and then used as a linker 
to connect POMs to 1D nanowire superstructures through direct bonding. In addition, 
POMs are ideal catalysts for redox reactions because of their rich electronic characteris-
tics. A series of experimental results show that the electron transfer and interactions 
between silver and POM clusters inside POM‐based nanowire heterostructures have 
significantly impacted the overall performance. Furthermore, compared with a single 
building block, the nanowires heterostructure has greatly improved the electrochemical 
H2O2 sensing properties and showed obviously improved catalytic efficiency for gaso-
line desulfurization.

4.3.3  POM-Based Nanostructures for Photocatalytic
In addition to electrochemistry and electrocatalysis properties, the photoactivity of 
POM‐based nanostructures has been attracting great attention owing to their diverse 
unique properties, such as the intrinsic charge carrier transfer characteristic, and 
impressive sensitivity to UV and visible light for several decades [87–91]. In addition, 
POM clusters have been employed to build atomically precise POM‐based organic 
frameworks since 2005 [92]. The POM‐based organic frameworks for heterogeneous 
catalytic reactions have made rapid progress because of their unique advantages. In 
2015, the photocatalysis using POM‐based organic frameworks was reported. Besides, 
the photocatalytic applications of POM‐based organic frameworks, such as photo-
catalytic CO2 reduction, selective oxidation of organics, and water decomposition, 
have been attracting attention [93, 94]. Moreover, the cluster‐based assemblies con-
structed by non‐covalent interactions were also used for photocatalysis.
From the previous review, we know that MOF is an attractive candidate for effi-
cient photocatalytic HER [95–97]. Recent research has found that the feasibility of 
combining POM with MOF can achieve enhanced optically driven H2 evolution

reaction [98–101]. In 2015, Lin and coworkers reported effective photocatalysts for 
HERs by encapsulating Wells‐Dawson‐type [P2W18O62]6− cluster in a [Ru(bpy)3]2+ 
(bpy = 2,2′‐bipyridine)‐anchored MOF (Figure 4.24). The POM clusters were loaded 
into a porous and MOF through the in situ simple charge‐assisted self‐assembly 
strategy, that is, the multifunctional molecular material can be achieved by simply 
heating a mixture of ZrCl4 and the [Ru(bpy)3]2+‐derived dicarboxylate ligand in the 
presence of Wells‐Dawson‐type [P2W18O62]6−. Here, the as‐prepared compounds 
can achieve visible‐light‐driven proton reduction by synergistic visible‐light excita-
tion of MOF and facile multielectron injection from the photoactive framework to 
[P2W18O62]6− guests. The results reveal that the as‐prepared POM‐based nanostruc-
tures have been shown to act as effective photocatalysts for HERs with turnover 
numbers of 79 under visible light (>400 nm) irradiation [102].
In follow‐up work, by adopting the same strategy, the same group of researchers 
reported the design and synthesis of effective catalytic system for photocatalysts 
HER via encapsulating Ni‐containing POM [Ni4(H2O)2(PW9O34)2]10− into the cavi-
ties of [Ir(ppy)2‐(bpy)]+‐anchored phosphorescent MOF (ppy = 2‐phenylpyridine, 
bpy  =  2,2′‐bipyridine) (Figure  4.25)  [103]. The multifunctional molecular ­ 
material can be achieved by simply heating a mixture of ZrCl4 and the [Ru(bpy)3]2+‐
derived dicarboxylate ligand in the presence of Wells‐Dawson‐type [P2W18O62]6−.

The obtained compounds were synthesized by in situ assembly approach. In the 
presence of Ni‐containing POM [Ni4(H2O)2(PW9O34)2]10−, employing ZrCl4 and 
different types of ligands such as the [Ir(ppy)2(bpy)]+‐derived dicarboxylic acid or 
[Ru(bpy)3]2+‐derived dicarboxylic acid, resulted in the formation of the POM‐
based nanostructure assemblies. In this system, each Ni‐containing POM mole-
cule is tightly surrounded by multiple [Ir(ppy)2(bpy)] photosensitizers, which 
promotes an easy multielectron transfer. The obtained compound possesses higher 
visible‐light photocatalytic HER property with turnover numbers of 1476.
Photocatalytic conversion of CO2 into energy‐intensive organic molecules (CO, 
HCOOH, CH2O, CH3OH, etc.) under sunlight is regarded as a green and sustainable 
and has attracted widespread attention. Recent research has shown that combining 
POM with MOF has proved to be an efficient catalyst for photocatalytic CO2 reduc-
tion reactions [104]. In 2020, Sassoye and coworkers reported co‐immobilization of 
a Keggin‐type POM PW12O40
3− and a Rh catalytic complex Cp*Rh(bpydc)Cl2 
(bpydc = 2,2′‐bipyridine‐5,5′‐dicarboxylic acid) in the Zr(IV) based metal organic 
framework (Figure 4.26). The obtained POM‐based compound was constructed by a 
two‐step synthesis strategy. Firstly, the encapsulation of cavities in MOF was real-
ized by in situ approach. Secondly, the resulting compound reacted with the Rh 
catalytic complex Cp*Rh(bpydc)Cl2. A series of experimental results showed that 
the obtained POM‐based compound possessed effective photocatalytic performance 
for CO2 reduction reaction. Interestingly, POM plays a crucial role in the photocata-
lytic reduction of CO2 into formate and H2 [105].

materials. Along with their bioactivities, it has been revealed that POM clusters are 
also disclosed to be capable of sensing diseases and conducting synergistic therapy 
based on their redox and near‐infrared absorption [106, 107]. Furthermore, due to 
their structural diversity and significantly reduced toxicity, POM‐based assemblies 
have been shown to have the potential to inhibit a variety of cancer types and thera-
peutics including photothermal therapy, enhanced radiotherapy, chemodynamic 
therapy, and multimodal imaging‐guided combined therapy [108].
The reduced POM is not as stable as the completely oxidized POM, especially 
when they are exposed to air. Furthermore, the oxidation state of POM cluster can 
be adjusted according to the environment around the cluster. In 2019, Zhang and 
coworkers reported a nanoprobe constructed by the self‐assembly of molybdenum‐
based POM (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O and the typical croconaine (CR) dye to detect 
Glutathione (GSH). As an important reducing substance, GSH participates in many 
cellular functions in vivo (Figure 4.27) [109]. The imbalance of GSH indicates the 
occurrence of physical diseases, especially the overexpression of GSH has been 
proven to be a typical characteristic of tumors. The CR dye can be reduced by GSH 
to decrease the absorbance at 700 nm while POMs displayed an increased absorb-
ance at 866 nm owing to the conversion of GSH‐activated Mo(VI) to Mo(V). The 
resulting amplified ratiometric absorbance at the two wavelengths (Ab866/Ab700) 
resulted in a relatively low detection value limit (0.51 mM). The self‐assembly of the 
croconaine (CR) dye and molybdenum Mo‐based POM cluster can be promoted by 
the acidic tumor microenvironment by protonation‐induced hydrogen bonding of 
POM, which was conducive to prolonging intratumoral retention time to enhance 
tumor accumulation. In addition, the limit of detection (LOD) value (0.51 mM) and 
the maximum detection value (14 mM) just cover the range of the GSH concentra-
tion in vivo (0.5−10 mM), which was highly competent for noninvasive quantifica-
tion of GSH in vivo. The collective advantage of non‐invasive photoacoustic imaging 
by measuring the ratio of GSH and acid‐activated self‐aggregation is conducive to 
expanding its wide application in other GSH‐related biological processes.
Owing to the inclusion of reducing atoms such as WV and MoV, some POM clus-
ters could act as photothermal agents due to the strong near‐infrared absorption 
corresponding to the intervalence charge transfer transition. In 2018, Wu and 
­coworkers reported a core‐shell supramolecular composite through the electrostatic 
interaction between a giant ring‐like molybdenum cluster Na15[MoVI

glycol (TEG) monomethyl ether terminals (Figure 4.28) [110]. The obtained POM‐
based supramolecular composite has the characteristics of precise chemical compo-
sition, low cytotoxicity, and monodispersion. Importantly, the formed core‐shell 
supramolecular composite displayed good biocompatibility and enhanced photo-
thermal properties. Because of the dense hydrophobic layer on the surface of POM 
clusters, the stability of the POM cluster is greatly improved, and the photothermal 
conversion effect is well preserved after coating with cationic surfactants. 
Furthermore, the surface covering surfactant component constructed a space to 
load drugs and other functional guest molecules. The delivered drug DOX was 
released together with the photothermal therapy process, and synergistic therapeu-
tic effects can be achieved.
In addition, some POM clusters can be modified by substituting one or more  
W/Mo atoms by transition or rare earth metal ions, thus displaying strong emis-
sion by the charge transfer transition. Davis and coworkers reported the influence 
of pH values on the stability and imaging properties of gadolinium polyoxotung-
state Gd(W5O18)2]9− (Figure 4.29) [111]. In addition, the nanoassemblies of gado-
linium polyoxotungstate with cationic mPEG brush block copolymers containing 
a segment 2‐dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate at different charge ratios were also 
prepared. In contrast to the original GdWO, the nanoassemblies which contain  
21 units of DMAEMA were shown to be highly stable with abidingly high relaxiv-
ity in the pH from 5.0 to 7.4. offering great potential for well‐defined polymer 
­stabilizers to improve the stability of POMs. This work displayed the important 
effect of pH values on the POMs nano‐assemblies for magnetic resonance imaging 
applications.

4.4  ­Conclusion and Perspectives
POMs are sub‐nanometer metal oxides with atomic precision structures and geom-
etries. Due to the rich substitutional chemistry of POM clusters, POM clusters can 
insert active sites and modifications through covalent or non‐covalent interactions. 
Moreover, metal‐substituted POM clusters are promising candidates for use as sub‐
nanometer building blocks. The structures and properties of the assemblies based 
on POM clusters can be precisely adjusted through sub‐nanometer building blocks 
at the molecular level. The multiple interactions between cluster building blocks 
and surrounding components, including electrostatic interaction, hydrogen bond-
ing, coordination bonding, solvophobic interaction, and van der Waals forces, may 
have a great impact on the performance of cluster‐based assemblies. In this chapter, 
the developments of POM cluster‐based assembly in the past several decades are 
depicted, including the assembly of covalence/coordination bond‐integrated hybrid 
organic–inorganic frameworks and the assembly of non‐covalently modified POM 
clusters. The work listed in this chapter provided various strategies for constructing 
POM‐based nanostructures with well‐defined structures and advanced functions.

However, this research field is not fully developed, and many challenges and addi-
tional research efforts should be devoted to this area. First, the post‐processing of 
cluster‐assembled materials is restricted by the relatively poor stability of nanoclus-
ters in terms of synthesis strategy. Second, the in situ devices should be developed to 
monitor the dynamic structural changes of POM‐based nanostructures during the 
reaction process and then uncover the real reaction mechanism. Finally, since POM‐
based nanostructures are highly sensitive to the surrounding environment, the inter-
actions between POM building blocks and the formation mechanism may not be well 
resolved. The relationship between the compositions, structures, and performances 
needs to be explored in depth, from both experimental and theoretical aspects.

5.1  ­Introduction
Metal‐containing clusters are ensembles of some metal (more than two) and ligands 
(coordinated atoms) intermediate in size between metal complexes and metal‐­
containing bulk solids [1–7]. Over the past 40 years, continuous synthetic efforts 
and advanced characterization techniques (single‐crystal X‐ray diffraction [SCXRD] 
and various spectroscopies) have created and solved a vast library of atomically pre-
cise clusters, with several atoms spanning to hundreds of atoms, displaying unique 
physical and chemical properties [1, 2]. Some of these atomically precise clusters 
give rise to collective behaviors that mimic those of traditional atoms, known as 
“superatoms” [6, 8, 9]. This concept has been widely used in the field of cluster sci-
ence. The work related to the theory, synthesis, and property exploration of the 
superatoms is rapidly advancing and flourishing, and some excellent reviews have 
summarized it in detail [1–6, 8–11]. Many of these superatoms have stable struc-
tures and tuneable physicochemical properties and are considered to be an effective 
class of nanoscale building blocks for the design and synthesis of new crystalline 
materials with tailored functionalities, which are called superatomic crystals 
(SACs) [1]. However, this potential is still in its infancy and faces many challenges, 
such as designing suitable building blocks with stability and reactivity, achieving 
large‐scale synthesis in high yields, controlling the self‐assembly process, promot-
ing strong coupling between superatoms, and understanding the resulting collective 
properties. Related research has only begun to emerge in the past few years, focus-
ing mainly on metallic clusters (such as Au [Au6, Au25, and Au38], Ag [Ag14, Ag29, 
Ag44, etc.]) [12, 13] and transition metal chalcogenide clusters with mainly octahe-
dral M6E8 and cubane M4E4 cores (M = metal; E = chalcogen) [1, 10, 14–17].
Transition metal chalcogenide clusters are a class of discrete aggregates composed 
of metals, chalcogenides, and ligands. Metal chalcogenide molecular clusters with 
well‐controlled and tuneable physical and chemical properties, such as electronic 
and magnetic, thermal transport, and redox activity, have received extensive atten-
tion from scientists [1–5, 7–9, 14, 17]. One of the most important ones is superatom

M6E8L6 (where M is a metal [Cr, Co, Fe, Re, Mo, W, etc.], E is a chalcogen [S, Se, Te], 
and L is a ligand [PEt3, CO, CN, etc.]), and related derivatives, like Ni9Te6(PEt3)8 [18–23]. 
Several synthetic strategies (covalent linking, fusion, coordination framework, and 
supramolecular assembly) are developed to assemble the M6E8L6 molecular clusters 
as superatomic building blocks into discrete oligomers and cluster‐assembled solids 
with well‐controlled configurations as well as the material properties of these sys-
tems. Especially, these clusters co‐crystallize with carbon clusters (such as fullerene) 
by electrostatic interactions in the solid state to form SACs, analogous to atoms (ions) 
held together in ionic solids [1]. The resulting assemblies show excellent collective 
properties and controllability. In this chapter, the advances in the preparation, modi-
fication, and assembly of M6E8L6‐based superatoms and their resulting collective 
properties (including tunable electrical transport, crystalline thermal conductivity, 
and ferromagnetism) in the last decade are highlighted.
5.2  ­Synthesis and Properties of M6E8L6 Superatoms
The fabrication of SACs begins with the design and synthesis of building blocks 
capable of assembling (reactivity) while maintaining their individual structures (sta-
bility) with tunable properties. In this section, we outline the general synthetic strate-
gies of the common M6E8L6 superatoms (Figure  5.1) and discuss their isolated 
properties (electrochemistry, magnetism, etc.). Specific modification approaches for 
generating reactive and functionalized superatoms will be introduced in the next 
section.
5.2.1  Synthesis of M6E8L6 Superatoms
The synthesis of superatoms can be divided into three cases (Figure 5.1) according 
to their synthetic environment: (i) gas‐phase synthesis, (ii) solution‐phase synthesis, 
and (iii) solid‐phase synthesis.
5.2.1.1  Gas-Phase Synthesis
Many theoretical and experimental studies of metal‐containing clusters, including 
the concept of “superatom,” are derived from gas phase experiments based on mass

spectrometry [26]. At first, it was Al clusters and then extended to various metals in 
magic‐size clusters [24]. They can be generally produced by laser‐induced vaporiza-
tion of metal or alloy substrates (Figure 5.1a) and detected by different spectrometries 
(such as mass spectrometry, ion‐mobility spectrometry, infrared photodissociation 
spectroscopy, and trapped ion electron diffraction photoelectron spectroscopy). 
Geometries of the clusters in the gas phase were assigned by combining experimen-
tal data with related quantum chemical calculations. However, the clusters prepared 
by this method show great limitations in the further assembly process: (i) high reac-
tivity and instability when collected from the synthetic environment; (ii) there are 
many kinds of products, and the target yield is low, so it is difficult to directional 
synthesis.
5.2.1.2  Solution-Phase Synthesis
Solution‐phase synthesis (Figure 5.1b) is the most widely used and efficient method 
for the preparation of metal clusters and has been systematically described and 
reviewed in many literatures [1, 2, 4, 5]. Among them, for metal chalcogenide clus-
ters, the most common synthetic strategies can be divided into two types: Method I, 
the association of metal (Mn+) and a source (like H2S, trialkylsilyl chalcogenide) of 
chalcogenide (E2−) ions; Method II, the reaction of metal precursors with chalcogen‐
containing precursors (such as phosphine chalcogenide). The quintessential exam-
ples of these approaches are the synthesis of [Fe6S8(PEt3)6]2+ (reaction of Fe(BF4)2 
with H2S under excess PEt3, Method I)  [18], Ni9Te6(PEt)3 (Ni(COD)2 (COD  =   
1,5‐cyclooctadiene) + TePEt3 + PEt3 in toluene, Method II) [20], and Co6Se8(PEt3)6 
(Co2(CO)8 + SePEt3 with in toluene, Method II, Figure 5.1b) [25].
5.2.1.3  Solid-Phase Synthesis
The premise of solid state synthesis is that the basic structural unit of the bulk solid 
material is a superatomic metal cluster, such as Re6E8X2, Mo6E8, and Li2Nb6X16 (E = S, 
Se, Te, and X = Cl, Br, and I) [6]. The superatomic metal‐chalcogenide core can be 
excised from the lattice by heating the solid in the presence of end‐capped ligands 
(such as cyanides, hydroxides, or halides) to give isolated superatoms (Figure 5.1c).
5.2.2  Properties of M6E8L6 Superatoms
Unlike isolated atoms, the properties of superatoms (electrochemistry  [27–31], 
magnetism [32–36], and others [37–41]) can be regulated by changes in the compo-
sition of atoms and ligands. The nature of the bonding within a cluster‐­chalcogenide 
core produces a highly delocalized electronic structural feature, which in turn 
endows these superatoms with rich electrochemical behaviors (e.g. oxidation and 
reduction potentials, and charge transport) [31]. The electrochemical properties of 
superatoms are primarily dictated by the composition and structure of the core 
(Figure 5.2), and they can be fine‐tuned by modifying the ligand shell and doping 
other metal atoms.
Metal‐chalcogenide clusters often exhibit high‐spin states and strong magnetic 
coupling, leading to ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic ground states  [32, 33].

A few theoretical studies and experimental results have begun to explore the com-
plex structure–property relationship between superatoms (including composition, 
structure, and charge state) and the resulting magnetic behavior [34]. For example, 
the theoretical and experimental magnetic tunability of the superatom Ni9Te6 
(PR3)8  [35, 42] and the experimentally obtained high‐spin (S  =  7/2) [NEt4]5 
[Fe6S8(CN)6] superatom stabilized by dual subshell filling [43].
5.3  ­Modification and Assembly of M6E8L6 Superatoms
5.3.1  Modification of Superatoms
Metal‐chalcogenide clusters, M6E8L6, consist of a metallic chalcogenide core and 
peripheral ligands. Its configuration is highly stable, and each component (M, E, 
Figure 5.2, and L) can be adjusted, which provides convenience for the rational 
design of functional materials. The passivating ligand shells present more changes 
and opportunities than those of the metallic chalcogenide core. For example, func-
tional complex phosphine ligands were used instead of simple phosphine ligands to 
modify and functionalize clusters, and locally unstable ligands (such as CO) were 
introduced to achieve differentiation (site‐differentiated clusters) and further con-
trolled assembly.
5.3.1.1  Functionalized Superatoms
In the last decade, researchers have designed a large number of functional phosphorus 
ligands that can be appended to the inorganic core. Great advancements in functio­
nalized Co6E8L6 were gained by Roy and co‐workers [1, 6]. For example, when the sim-
ple  PEt3 (Figure  5.3a) were replaced by diethyl‐4‐(methylthio)phenyl phosphine 
(Figure  5.3b), the Co6E8(PEt2PhSMe)6 clusters can be used to measure conductance 
through single Co6E8 (E  =  S, Se) molecular junctions  [44]. Co6Se8(PEt2phen)6

5.3  Modification and Assembly of M6E8L6 Superatoms
(PEt2phen  =  diethyl(9‐ethynylphenanthrene)‐phosphine) (Figure  5.3c) with strong 
structural adaptability was prepared by replacing the ethyl moiety with 
9‐ethynylphenanthrene [45]. The cluster associated with C60 forms a complex stacking 
form different from the SAC of Co6Se8(PEt3)6 (Figure 5.3a) and C60. C60 spontaneously 
assembles into a neutral corrugated monolayer. The oriented layer and the fullerene 
layer form a two‐dimensional (2D) van der Waals solid with strong intralayer bonding 
and weak interlayer bonding, and the material can be mechanically exfoliated.
In addition to the above design of the phosphine ligand to functionalize the clusters, 
another method has been developed based on the stability of the Co6E8P6 clusters. 
First, clusters are synthesized with reactive phosphine ligands, and reactions and 
modifications are performed based on the clusters. For example, Co6Se8(PEt2PhBr)6 
can be successively reacted with n‐BuLi, CO2, and HCl to produce the carboxylic acid‐
functionalized superatom Co6Se8(PEt2(4‐PhCOOH))6 (Figure 5.3d) [46]. This super-
atom can be used as a building block to form assemblies with distinct preassembled 
clusters in the framework. Velian’s group developed a generalizable strategy to delib-
erately lower the symmetry of existing nanoclusters M3Co6Se8L′6 (M3, L′ = Ph2PN(H)
(4‐tolyl/isopropyl), M = Fe, Co, Zn, Sn) with three degenerate surface sites (M) that 
can engage with substrates and linkers, enabling them to function as catalysts and 
building blocks alike [47–52].
5.3.1.2  Site-Differentiated Superatoms
In addition to the above‐mentioned phosphine‐ligand‐protected clusters (Figure 5.3), 
site‐differentiated clusters have also been synthesized, mainly to explore the differ-
ences in related properties and construct interesting oligomers. For example,  
two site‐differentiated clusters [trans‐Co6Se8(PEt2(p‐C6H4SMe))2(PEt3)4][PF6], and 
[cis‐Co6Se8(PEt2(p‐C6H4SMe))2(PEt3)4][PF6] were prepared and used to measure 
conductance through single Co6Se8 molecular junctions [44].

By installing kinetically inert and labile ligands at certain positions, reactive site‐ 
differentiated superatoms can be used to create discrete oligomers, which are a neces-
sary first step in the formation of extended assemblies for the fabrication of materials 
with broader compositions, structures, and properties [6]. The most explored labile 
ligands are CO and carbene, such as the carbonylated superatoms Co6Se8(CO)x(PEt3)6−x 
(x = 1–3) [53]. Isolation of these carbonylated site‐differentiated clusters was achieved 
by combining an excess of elemental Se with Co2(CO)8 and a phosphine to yield a 
distribution of carbonylated products that can be easily separated through tradi-
tional silica gel chromatography or fractional crystallization. The CO group is a syn-
thetically useful handle that can be easily manipulated. For example, the Co6Se8(CO)
(PEt3)5 has enabled the development of a new family of superatom‐containing 
diblock copolymers that can template the formation of microstructures such as vesi-
cles [54]. A polymerizable monomer based on norbornene is first tethered to the 
Co6Se8 core through the substitution of the photolabile carbonyl ligand. This mono-
mer is then polymerized sequentially through ring‐opening meta­thesis polymeriza-
tion with another block to create the superatom‐containing diblock copolymer 
(Figure 5.4a). The integration of superatoms into a well‐defined block copolymer 
opens new possibilities to direct their assemblies into mesoscale structures. The 
diblock copolymer shown in Figure 5.4a is composed of two immi­scible blocks: a 
hydrophilic, cationic superatom‐containing block and a hydrophobic, cross linkable 
cinnamoyl‐containing block. In nonpolar solvent mixtures, this diblock copolymer

self‐assembles to form microscale vesicles (Figure 5.4). The cationic superatoms are 
contained within the hydrophobic vesicle walls, which can be further crosslinked by 
exploiting the photoreactivity of the cinnamoyl moieties. Moreover, these vesicles 
can be used to encapsulate molecular cargo, such as methylene blue. The electro-
chemical properties of the polymer are controlled by its self‐assembly behavior.
5.3.2  Assembly of Superatoms
5.3.2.1  Discrete Bridged and Fused Oligomers of Superatoms
A powerful approach to create oligomers of superatoms is to design differentiated 
building blocks with high reactivity, which can be selectively modified, dissociated, 
or substituted post‐synthesis [6]. To form oligomers, these site‐differentiated clus-
ters are connected together by bridging linkers or by fusion of the cores upon 
removal of reactive ligands.
In 2016, Roy and co‐workers developed a facile method to create and separate the 
differentially and directionally substituted superatoms, Co6Se8(CO)x(PEt3)(6−x). The 
CO groups on the cluster can be exchanged quantitatively with phosphines 
(Figure 5.4) and isonitriles (such as 1,4‐phenylene diisocyanide, Figure 5.5a) [53]. 
The substitution of CO with bridging ligands allows us to manipulate the type and 
length of chemical bridge between two redox‐active superatomic centers in order 
to modulate intersuperatomic coupling. Linking two superatoms together by 
1,4‐­phenylene diisocyanide forms the simplest superatom molecule: a diatomic 
molecule (Co12Se16(PEt3)10(CNC6H4NC), Figure 5.5a). In addition, a trimer struc-
ture, Co18Se24(PEt3)14(CNC6H4NC)2, was also obtained by reacting trans‐Co6Se8 
(CNC6H4NC)2(PEt3)4 (formed from trans‐Co6Se8(CO)2(PEt3)4) with two site‐­
differentiated Co6Se8(CO)(PEt3)5 clusters to link the units together through photo-
dissociation of the CO ligand, and in the trimer, the three superatoms are connected 
in a linear arrangement to form an acyclic triatomic molecule.
Using a related strategy, the site‐differentiated superatoms [Re6E8(L)nX(6−n)](n−4)+ 
can be prepared from [Re6E8X6]3−/4− by selectively substituting some of the halide 
ligands with various labile reactive ligands or inert ligands (L), such as [Re6Se8(PR3)4

(MeCN)2]2+ and [Re6Se8(PEt3)(6−n)(CO)n]2+ (n  =  1 or 2)  [27, 56]. These site‐­
differentiated clusters have been used as building blocks for the fabrication of vari-
ous oligomers (linear dimers, trimers [molecular stars], tetramers [molecular 
squares and stars], and dendrimers [molecular trees]) through pyridyl ligand substi-
tution [15–17, 57, 58].
Although the ligand‐bridging strategy enables superatom dimers to be studied  
in the weakly coupled limit, fusing them together leads to much stronger inter‐­
superatom coupling. A chemical transformation was developed to covalently expand 
the Co6Se8 core to a Co12Se16 core through direct fusion (Figure 5.5b) [55]. The key 
intermediate is obtained in one step, in high yield, from a carbonylated cluster and 
contains a carbene ligand that acts as a bifunctional protecting group for the Se and 
Co atoms involved in the subsequent fusion. Recently, Nuckolls and co‐workers 
showed that reaction pathways from a single superatom motif can be controlled 
through subtle electronic modification of the outer ligand spheres [59]. Co6Se8L6 
(L = PR3, CO) superatoms are used to form carbene‐terminated (C(H)SiMe3) clus-
ters, and the surface ligand spheres in the carboene‐substituted cluster clusters 
Co6Se8L6 (L = PEt3, CO, and C(H)SiMe3) can be controlled, thereby affecting the 
ligand substitution ability, cluster fusion reactivity, or the shape of the cluster core. 
This carbene provides new routes for ligand substitution chemistry, which is used to 
selectively install cyanide or pyridine ligands (such as [NBu4][Co6Se8(CN)(PEt3)5], 
[Co6Se8(CNC6H3Me2)(PEt3)5], and [Co6Se8(py)(PEt3)5]), which were previously 
inaccessible in these cobalt‐based clusters. The surrounding ligands also impact the 
ability of this carbene to create larger fused clusters of the type Co12Se16L10. Using 
this information, we developed methods of creating dimeric clusters with function-
alized surface ligands with site specificity, putting new ligands in specific positions 
on this anisotropic core, such as [trans‐Co12Se16(CO)2(PEt3)8], [trans‐Co12Se16(PEt2 
(p‐C6H4SMe))2(PEt3)8][PF6] and [cis‐Co12Se16(PEt2(p‐C6H4SMe))2(PEt3)8][PF6].
5.3.2.2  Supermolecule Assembly
A simple strategy for creating SACs is to use charge transfer between neutral clus-
ters, where one cluster is electron‐donating (such as Co6Se8(PEt3)6, Cr6Te8(PEt3)6, 
Ni9Te6(PEt3)8, and their derivatives) and the other is electron‐accepting (such as 
fullerenes, [FeCl4], [W6Cl14], [Fe8O4pz12X4] (X = Cl and Br), and their derivatives), 
with electrostatic attraction between clusters as the driving force for co‐assembly 
and crystallization (Figure 5.6) [1, 31, 42, 45, 60–64]. The internal structures of the 
constituent clusters remain unchanged, but charge is transferred between them, 
resulting in solid‐state compounds. Figure  5.6 presents the representative SACs 
reported to date and their atomic structural analogs. For example, [Co6Se8(PEt3)6]
[C60]2 (CdI2 structure, Figure 5.6b) [60], [Co6Te8(PnPr3)6][C60]3 [61], [Cr6Te8(PEt3)6]
[C60]2, [Ni9Te6(PEt3)8][C60] (NaCl structure, Figure 5.6c), [Ni9Te6(PMe3)8][C60] [60], 
[Co6Te8(PEt3)6][Fe8O4pz12Cl4] (CsCl structure, Figure  5.6d), and its derivatives 
([Co6Se8(PEt3)6][Fe8O4pz12Cl4], [Co6Te8(PEt3)6][Fe8O4pz12Br4], [Co6Te8(PEt2Ph)6]
[Fe8O4pz12Cl4], and [Co6Te8(PnPr3)6][Fe8O4pz12Cl4]) [31]; [Ni12Te12(PEt3)8]2[(Lu3N@
C80)2] (as the superatomic structural analog of the binary atomic compound rubid-
ium peroxide, Rb2O2, Figure 5.6e) [65]. In contrast to traditional atomic solids, in 

139
which the atoms (or ions) are spherical, superatoms afford more flexibility and vari-
ations that can be used to tune the composition and crystal packing of SACs. The 
combination of atomic precision and intercluster interactions in these SACs pro-
duces novel collective properties, including tunable electrical transport, crystalline 
thermal conductivity, and ferromagnetism.
In addition, using two geometrically similar metal chalcogenide clusters 
(Co6Se8(PEt3)6 and Cr6Te8(PEt3)6) with C60 in three different ratios, in a crystal lat-
tice, Yang et al. successfully prepared superatomic solid solutions, [Co6Se8(PEt3)6]x 
[Cr6Te8(PEt3)6]1−x[C60]2 (x = 0–1) [64]. This does not alter the underlying crystalline 
structure of the solid solution material, but it influences its electronic and magnetic 
properties. All three solid solutions showed increased electrical conductivities com-
pared with either the Co‐ or Cr‐based parent material, substantially so for two of the 
Co:Cr ratios (up to 100‐fold), and lowered activation barriers for electron transport. 
This interesting phenomenon is attributed to the existence of additional energy 
states arising from the material’s structural heterogeneity, which effectively narrow 
transport gaps.
By analogy to traditional layered atomic materials, SACs can be intercalated with 
redox‐active guests and maintain their atomic structure. In 2017, Roy team found 
that tetracyanoethylene (TCNE) can be inserted into the SAC [Co6Te8(PnPr3)6][C60]3 
(Figure  5.6a) through a single‐crystal‐to‐single‐crystal transformation  [61]. The 
intercalation compounds, [Co6Te8(PnPr3)6][C60]3[TCNE]2, are synthesized by 
immersing crystals of [Co6Te8(PnPr3)6][C60]3 in a solution of redox‐active TCNE. The

intercalation process is driven by the oxidation of the host by TCNE. This intercala-
tion strategy opens the door to exciting opportunities to manipulate the optical, 
electronic, and magnetic properties of the materials in much the same way as it has 
been used to tune atomic solids.
More complex superstructures can be formed through simple modifications of the 
superatom ligand sphere (Figure 5.7). In 2016, Roy and co‐workers prepared a lay-
ered van der Waals solid, [Co6Se8(PEt2phen)6][C60]5 (Figure 5.7a), self‐assembled 
from a structure‐directing building block (anisotropic Co6Se8(PEt2phen)6 
(PEt2phen = diethyl(9‐ethynylphenanthrene)‐phosphine)) and C60 fullerene [45]. 
While the phenanthrenes on each phosphine are flat and provide only weak vdW 
interactions with C60, three phenanthrene groups rotate in concert to form a host–
guest structure with C60 (Figure 5.7a). The resulting hexagonal brown crystalline 
solid (Figure  5.7b) contains a corrugated monolayer of neutral fullerenes 
(Figure 5.7d) and can be mechanically exfoliated (Figure 5.7c). The absorption spec-
trum of the bulk solid shows an optical gap of 0.39 ± 0.04 eV that is consistent with 
thermal activation energy obtained from electrical transport measurement. The 
dimensional confinement of fullerenes significantly modulates their optical and 
electronic properties compared to bulk solid. After that, Zhu and Roy used the mate-
rial as a template to polymerize its C60 monolayers, which can be exfoliated down to 
2D crystalline nanosheets [66]. Derived from the parent template, the 2D structure 
is composed of a layer of inorganic clusters sandwiched between two monolayers of 
polymerized C60. The nanosheets can be transferred onto solid substrates and depo-
lymerized by heating. Electronic absorption spectroscopy reveals an optical gap of 
0.25 eV, narrower than that of the bulk parent crystalline solid.
Replacing the C60 building block with other carbon materials provides further 
opportunities to uncover new structures and properties in SACs. For example, when 
C70 is combined with Co6Te8(PEt3)6, a phase‐rich SAC [Co6Te8(PEt3)6][C70]2

(Figure  5.8) is formed with two separate thermally driven phase transitions as a 
result of the unique complementarity in the size, structure, and redox capabilities of 
the constituent superatoms [62]. The material, composed of the molecular cluster 
Co6Te8(PEt3)6 and the fullerene C70, adopts a structure analogous to CdI2 containing 
both monomeric and dimerized fullerenes, and has three structural phases. 
Figure 5.8a depicts all three phases, and Figure 5.8b, c emphasizes the major struc-
tural changes that take place across each transition. At low temperatures, the lattice 
consists of orientationally ordered monomeric C70 and dimeric C140
2−, which become 
dynamically disordered above ∼240 K. This order–disorder transition converts the 
thermal transport properties of [Co6Te8(PEt3)6][C70]2 from crystalline to amorphous 
behavior. At ∼330 K, the C140
2− dimers dissociate, activating a new electronic band in 
the fullerene sublattice. This coupled structural‐electronic phase transition drasti-
cally increases the electrical conductivity (Figure 5.8e) and spin density (Figure 5.8f) 
of the material while significantly decreasing the optical gap energy (Figure 5.8d).
Paley and Nuckolls reported the preparation of a series of novel superatomic 
architectures ([Co12Se16(PEt3)10]2[C140][toluene]x (x = 1.44, 2, or 3)) that are built 
from rod‐shaped Co12Se16(PEt3)10 and C140 nanoclusters [63]. Initially, the rod‐like 
Co12Se16(PEt3)10 was combined with C70, and a cascade event was found, including 
electron transfer from the rod‐like superatom to C70, which then dimerized to form 
C140 dianions. The close matching in size and shape of the C140 dianion and the

5.3  Modification and Assembly of M6E8L6 Superatoms

5  Small Transition Metal Chalcogenide Superatom Clusters
142
Co12Se16(PEt3)10 cation results in the assembly of complex solids with novel rod 
packing motifs. Even more remarkable are their non‐close‐packed structures due to 
the shape anisotropy of the constituent clusters, which affords voids to accommo-
date solvent molecules. These embedded small molecules (toluene) act as crystal 
modulators that can adjust the solid‐state structure and properties (optical gaps and 
electrical conduction) by changing their stoichiometry.
These materials with excellent collective properties have broad application pros-
pects, yet their high crystallinity powder formulations hinder their use as functional 
materials in devices. Formation of superatomic ionic crystals is dominated by the 
strong electrostatic interactions between the constituent clusters that result in the 
crystallization of ionic pairs. Yang and Nuckolls inhibit the electrostatic interactions 
between these nanoclusters by using a fullerene derivative with long and flexible 
side chains, so that the ionic superatomic materials can be easily solution‐processed 
into completely amorphous and homogeneous thin films [67]. These new amor-
phous superatomic materials show tunable compositions and new properties that 
are not achievable in crystals, including very high electrical conductivities of up to 
300 S m−1, ultralow thermal conductivities of 0.05 W m−1 K−1, and high optical trans-
parency of up to 92%.
5.3.2.3  Covalent Superatomic Crystals
To create SACs with strong electronic coupling, it is necessary to covalently link the 
superatoms [46]. The formation of such extended structures remains a major syn-
thetic challenge. Here, several examples of constructing extended structures with 
different types of ligands are introduced.
Cyanides are especially attractive bridges as they enable strong mechanical, elec-
tronic, and magnetic coupling between a variety of metals (Figure  5.9)  [57, 68, 
70–74]. Cyanide ligands can also be used in a bridging configuration to form three‐
dimensional (3D) cubic coordination frameworks analogous to Prussian blue 
(Figure 5.9a). For example, superatoms with six surface‐capping cyanides, such as 
[M6E8(CN)6]n− (M = Re, Mo, W, and E = S, Se, Te) and [M6Cl12(CN)6]n− (M = Nb, Ta), 
have been polymerized with various metal ions to form cluster‐expanded Prussian 
blue analogs that crystallize in the prototypical cubic lattice (Figure 5.9b) [57, 68, 70, 
74]. Using the same CN‐bearing superatomic units, frameworks with various 1D, 2D, 
and 3D expanded structures are accessible by varying the ratio and topology of the 
building blocks [71–73]. Recently, Roy reported a synthetic strategy to control the 
dimensionality of the superatomic framework using a site‐differentiated superatom 
[trans‐Co6Se8(CN)4(CO)2]3−/4− with four cyanides around its belt and two carbonyls 
at the apexes (Figure 5.9a) [68, 69]. The two groups have orthogonal reactivity: the 
cyanides can bridge but are inert toward substitution, while the carbonyls are photo-
labile but do not bridge. The “2D superatomic node” [trans‐Co6Se8(CN)4(CO)2]3− 
with CoBr2 in the presence of pyridine formed a layered vdW material, 
[Co(py)4]2[trans‐Co6Se8(CN)4(CO)2], which is presented in the form of bulk single 
crystals (Figure 5.9c). The resulting vdW material can be mechanically exfoliated to 
produce atomically thin flakes as thin as bilayers with photolabile CO ligands on the 
exfoliated surface. Their surfaces can be functionalized through simple 

143
photoinduced substitution chemistry. For example, these surface CO ligands can be 
substituted by 4‐isocyanoazobenzene under blue light irradiation.
Bejger and co‐workers reported a new approach to synthesize 2D nanosheets and 
3D networks from the bottom‐up (Figure  5.10)  [46]. They functionalized redox‐
active superatoms by a post‐reaction method (Figure  5.3d), and the Co6Se8[PEt2 
(4‐C6H4COOH)]6 clusters with –COOH groups can be directly assembled into mul-
tidimensional solids. Co6Se8[PEt2(4‐C6H4COOH)]6 can self‐assemble into an organ-
ized, extended 3D solid via extensive and ordered hydrogen bonding between 
carboxylic acids in neighboring clusters. Due to the strong coordination tendency 
between carboxylic acid and metal ions, Co6Se8[PEt2(4‐C6H4COOH)]6 was solvo-
thermally reacted with Zn(NO3)2 to obtain two types of crystalline materials, 
depending upon solvent conditions. One is a trigonal 3D solid (Trig3D), and the 
other is a tetragonal 2D solid (Tet2D). SCXRD reveals that Trig3D is a 3D network of 
Co6Se8 superatoms held together with zinc carboxylate bonds, while Tet2D forms 2D 
sheets held together by zinc–carboxylate bonds that stack through noncovalent 
interactions into a 3D solid. These 2D sheets can be chemically exfoliated, and the

exfoliated, ultrathin 2D layers are soluble, and they retain the redox activity of their 
constituent superatoms.
In 2020, Velian reported the synthesis of three anisotropic van der Waals solids  
(2‐bpy, 2‐bpyσ, and 2‐bpyπ) using the designed tritopic superatomic nanocluster 
Co3(py)3Co6Se8(Ph2PN(Tol))6 (py = pyridine) and three ditopic linear linkers with dif-
ferent length and structural flexibility (4,4′‐bipyridine (bpy), 1,2‐di(4‐pyridyl)ethylene 
(bpyσ) and 1,2‐bi(4‐pyridyl) ethane (bpyπ), Figure 5.11a) [49]. Three cluster‐based mate-
rials (2‐bpy, 2‐bpyσ, and 2‐bpyπ) are structurally similar, where clusters are connected 
by pyridine ligands to form a 2D layered structure and then stacked into 3D crystals 
through weak interactions. The structure, morphology, and stacking of nanosheets in 
3D crystals change slightly (Figure 5.11b). The cluster‐assembled materials obtained 
from these superatomic nanoclusters represented some interesting examples where pre-
formed building blocks (Co3(py)3Co6Se8(Ph2PN(Tol))6) encode their key structural and 
physical properties, including in‐plane anisotropy, chirality, redox activity, and magnet-
ism. The 3D van der Waals solids can be mechanically exfoliated into ultrathin flakes 
(8–60 nm), and the intercalation of redox‐active guest tetracyanoethylene can also be 
achieved by single‐crystal to single‐crystal transformation. In addition, they recently 
found the redox‐switchable allosteric effects of the site‐different Zn3Co6Se8(Ph2PN 
(Tol))6 nanocluster [50]. As a guiding force, this effect is employed to assemble the 
superatom into 1D or 2D materials and to encode them with emissive properties.
Electro‐crystallization is also a powerful technique to assemble superatoms into 
atomically precise extended structures. Using this approach, molecular ions are 
assembled from solution into ordered solid‐state crystals at an electrode by slowly 
oxidizing an electroactive compound in the presence of an electrolyte. Batail and 
co‐workers reported a simple electro‐crystallization route to nanoscopic 2D woven 
structures, {[Co6Se8(PEt3)4](CNC6H4NC)}2[Mo6O19] [75], reminiscent of the meth-
ods used to produce macroscopic textiles (Figure 5.12a). In the presence of a shape‐
complementary anionic template (Lindqvist polyoxometalate Mo6O19

of the anionic cluster filling the void space of the weave. The crossing point of the 
weaving strands comprises π–π stacked aryl groups of the diisocyanide linkers 
(Figure 5.12f). This material demonstrates unprecedented complexity at the nanoscale, 
with the covalently linked Co6Se8 cores further interacting through weaving.

of the core. For superatom‐based materials, the difference in electronic structure 
can be initially explored by cyclic voltammogram (CV) test. For example, the elec-
trochemical properties of the Co6Se8 dimers depend on the type of inter‐superatom 
linkage (Figure 5.13). Three redox couples are observed for the diisocyanide‐bridged 
dimer Co12Se16(PEt3)(CNC6H4NC) synthesized from Co6Se8(CO)(PEt3)5 precur-
sors [53]. These redox couples are due to the additive shuttling of two electrons, 
with each redox event corresponding to a two‐electron process. The fused dimer 
Co12Se12(PEt3)10, however, displays a drastically different redox behavior: the CV 
shows five distinct and reversible one‐electron events that give access to the −1 to 
+5 charge states [55]. Thus, the direct coupling of superatomic cores provides access 
to a wider range of redox states.

At the same time, these clusters were successfully fabricated with atomic preci-

active Co–Se superatoms with varying ligand geometries and core nuclearities

characteristics of Co–Se superatoms are independent of ligand placement, and 
these behave as sequential, single‐electron units (Figure 5.14b). The dimer‐L2 pos-
sesses smaller reorganization energy and more accessible redox states than the 
monomeric analogs, exhibits significantly higher currents, and can even be pushed 
to current saturation at high bias (Figure 5.14c).
Some fullerene‐based superatomic materials (M6E8L6) exhibit thermally activated 
electronic transport behavior, such as [Cr6Te8(PEt3)6][C60]2, [Co6Se8(PEt3)6][C60]2, 
[Co6Te8(PnPr3)6][C60]3, and [Co6Se8(phen)6][C60]5 [45, 60, 61]. The electrical proper-
ties of these materials are determined by electrical resistivity measurements with 
double and four probes based on single crystals and pressed pellets. The test results 
show that their conductance (G) decreases exponentially with decreasing tempera-
ture, indicating that they have thermal activation behavior. Activation energy (Ea) 
varies with the structure and composition of these materials, with values of 
∼100 meV ([Cr6Te8(PEt3)6][C60]2), ∼150 meV ([Co6Se8(PEt3)6][C60]2), ∼200 meV 
([Co6Te8(PnPr3)6][C60]3), and ∼400 meV ([Co6Se8(phen)6][C60]5). Besides, the electri-
cal conductivity of these materials can also be modulated by inserting redox‐active 
molecules into the lattice. For example, by inserting TCNE (tetracyanoethylene) 
into [Co6Te8(PnPr3)6][C60]3 through a single‐crystal‐to‐single‐crystal transforma-
tion, the carrier density of the crystalline material was tuned and its electrical prop-
erties were adjusted (Figure  5.15)  [61]. The electrical conductivity (σ) of the 
intercalated material [Co6Te8(PnPr3)6][C60]3[TCNE]x varies with the insertion 
amount (x) of TCNE (Figure 5.15b). At room temperature, σ has a maximum value 
(0.2 S m−1) in the absence of TCNE (x = 0); with the increase of x, the value of σ 
decreases by four orders of magnitude. Meanwhile, with the increase in x, the acti-
vation energy of electrical transport increases from 0.2 to 0.85 eV (Figure 5.15c). 
This increase in Ea is in good agreement with the optical measurement results, indi-
cating that the band gap of [Co6Te8(PnPr3)6][C60]3 is expanded to ∼0.65 eV after

Atomically precise hierarchical structures of superatomic materials (M6E8L6), pos-
sessing multiple intra/inter interactions based on superatoms, produce a more com-
plex vibrational landscape, which provides a unique opportunity to study the basic 
properties of phonons and may lead to unexpected heat transport phenomena. At 
present, the reported superatomic materials with thermal transport behavior 
(M6E8L6) are mainly affected by two factors: one is the internal vibration of super-
atoms; the other is the collective inter‐superatom phonons, whose mean free paths 
can be adjusted by the spacing and the strength of the interactions between the 
superatoms  [25]. The thermal conductivity properties of single‐component 
Co6E8(PEt3)6 and binary [Co6E8(PEt3)6][C60]2 (E = S, Se, Te) [25] were investigated 
by a combination of SCXRD, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), frequency‐
domain thermoreflectance (FDTR), and theoretical calculations. The calculated 
heat capacities of these materials are always lower (20–35%) than the experimental

values measured by DSC (Figure 5.16a), which is attributed to the collective low‐­
frequency inter‐superatom vibrational modes emerging upon crystallization, which 
are not captured by the theoretical calculations. The FDTR thermal conductivity 
measurement results show that the thermal conductivity has a linear scaling rela-
tionship with the sound speed, which further supports above conclusion, which 
strongly indicates that the thermal transport in these materials mainly comes from 
the extended phonon states naturally generated by the collective wave effect 
(Figure 5.16b). The thermal conductivity of these superatomic materials exhibits 
temperature dependence. For example, [Co6E8(PEt3)6][C60]2 exhibits an unusual 
transition from amorphous state to crystalline thermal transport behavior at 200 K 
(Figure 5.16c). This change can be attributed to the structural phase transformation 
between the high‐symmetry, dynamically disordered phase at high temperature and 
the low‐symmetry, highly ordered phase at low temperature. Specifically, below the

phase transition temperature, the free rotation of the C60 is suppressed, and the 
material orientation is ordered. In this state, the scattering of phonons is reduced 
and their mean free path is increased. The overall effect is that the thermal conduc-
tivity of the material increases rapidly with a decrease in temperature, which is 
similar to that of crystalline atomic solids.

5.5  ­Conclusion and Perspectives
In this chapter, we comprehensively introduced the synthesis, modification, and 
assembly of small transition metal chalcogenide M6E8L6 superatom clusters (mainly 
Co and Re metal clusters) and summarized their properties (electrochemistry, mag-
netism, and collective properties). In this system, bottom‐up assembly of prefabri-
cated molecular clusters with stable structures into well‐defined hierarchical 
materials through various interactions (such as covalent bonds, electrostatic inter-
actions, and van der Waals interactions) has proven to be a successful method for 
designing new functional materials (superatomic crystals), which exhibit collective 
physical properties that emerge as a result of their atomic precision. The M6E8L6 
building blocks have been extensively modified by functional ligands to realize the 
performance regulation of themselves and hierarchical materials and the emer-
gence of new exciting collective properties. Of course, there are still many scientific 
problems to be solved in this field. The types and functions of the superatoms are 
not rich enough, and the related assembly strategies need to be further explored. 
The relationship between the structure and physical properties of assembled mate-
rials still needs to be understood.

6.1  ­Introduction
Cadmium chalcogenide (CdS/Se) nanomaterials have gained great attention in the 
past two decades for their potential photophysical and catalytic applications [1–6]. 
Nano- or sub-nano-sized cadmium chalcogenide supertetrahedral clusters (CCSCs), 
bearing the closest structural resemblance to II–VI or I–III–VI semiconductor 
nanocrystals, can be considered as atomically precise ultrasmall quantum dots 
(QDs) [7–13]. Because of their uniform sizes, well-defined structures, and ordered 
dopant distribution, CCSCs offer ample opportunities for a broad and in-depth under-
standing of the precise structure–composition–property relationships, which are criti-
cal to the exploitation of their functional applications [8, 11]. Generally, CCSCs can be 
subdivided into three types: supertetrahedral clusters (denoted as Tn, n represents the 
metal layers in each cluster), penta-supertetrahedral clusters (denoted as Pn, the Pn 
cluster is regarded as the assembly of four Tn clusters capped onto the four faces of 
one anti-Tn cluster), and ligand-capped supertetrahedral clusters (denoted as Cn, the 
Cn cluster has a regular Tn cluster at the core covered with a shell whose stoichiom-
etry is related to the Tn cluster) [3, 7–10]. Compared with the ligand-capped supertet-
rahedral Cn-type clusters, the majority of which preferentially adopt a discrete mode 
whether in the crystal lattice or in solvents, the Tn- and Pn-type clusters prefer to 
self-assemble into the open frameworks through cornersharing mode [3].
Atomically precise CCSCs-based open framework materials with the effective 
integration of porosity and semiconductor properties have attracted widespread 
interest [14]. A series of design strategies such as creating different-sized and com-
positionally diverse clusters have been explored for enriching the CCSCs-based 
open frameworks [9, 10, 15]. Besides, the intercluster linkages also play an impor-
tant role in constructing the CCSCs-based open frameworks with new structure 
types and properties. Accordingly, in terms of the different linkage modes, the 
CCSCs-based open frameworks can be classified as follows: (i) inorganic open 
frameworks containing extended arrays of inorganic connectivity via Cd-X-Cd 
bonding (X represents the anionic S, Se, and halogen), (ii) organic open frameworks

formed through Cd-L-Cd connectivity (where L is a polyfunctional organic 
ligand) [3]. As a new family of materials over the discrete supertetrahedral clusters, 
CCSCs-based open framework materials show greater expansion in structure or 
property. Therefore, the investigation of CCSCs-based open frameworks is of great 
significance in both fundamental research and applications. In this chapter, after a 
brief overview of the synthesis and structure of CCSCs determined by X-ray single-
crystal diffraction, we will focus on the assembly of CCSCs into extended frame-
works and their properties.
6.2  ­Synthesis and Structure of Cadmium 
Chalcogenide Supertetrahedral Clusters
6.2.1  Tn-Type Clusters
Cadmium chalcogenide supertetrahedral clusters (CCSCs) are tetrahedrally shaped 
fragments of the cubic ZnS-type lattice, which are generally denoted as Tn, where n 
represents the metal layers in each cluster. In 1983, the Holm group reported the first 
atomically precise T2-type CCSC (Et4N)2[Cd4(SPh)10] using benzenethiol (PhSH) as 
the organic ligand by vapor diffusion [16]. The crystal structure of (Et4N)2[Cd4(SPh)10] 
consists of discrete cations and anions. [Cd4(SPh)10]2− contains an adamantane-like 
Cd4(μ2-SPh)6 cage, composed of a distorted Cd4 tetrahedron and a highly and irregu-
larly distorted S6 octahedron, wherein each Cd is also capped by another SPh− via 
μ-type coordination mode (Figure 6.1a). The Cd4(μ2-SPh)6 cage being stable, the selec-
tive substitution of the terminal thiolate or selenolate ligands appears feasible, giving 
rise to an interesting class of heteroligated clusters. Subsequently, Payne group syn-
thesized the fully terminally halogen-substituted T2-type CCSC (Me4N)2[Cd4(EPh)6Br4] 
(E = S, Se), starting from the (Me4N)2[Cd4(SPh)10] (Figure 6.1b).
Subsequently, two T3-type CCSCs [S4Cd10(SPh)16]4− and [Se4Cd10(SPh)16]4− were 
prepared by Dance and coworkers via the reactions of sulfur or selenium with the 
adamantanoid cages [Cd4(SPh)10]2− in 1984 (Figure  6.1c)  [17]. Both the T3-type 
CCSCs have the same (μ3-E)4Cd10S16 (E = S, Se) core structure, which is a supertet-
rahedral fragment of the cubic (sphalerite) CdE lattice. Each of the 30 Cd and chal-
cogenide atoms has tetrahedral or part-tetrahedral stereochemistry. Six of the Cd 
atoms are arrayed as an inner octahedron, with four of its faces capped by triply 
bridging chalcogenide ions, and the other four faces of the inner Cd6 octahedron are 
capped by podant [(μ1-SPh)3Cd-SPh] groups. Therefore, each inner Cd atom is coor-
dinated by two triply bridging chalcogenide ions and two doubly bridging thiolate 
ligands, and each outer metal atom is coordinated by three doubly bridging and one 
terminal thiolate ligand. The sulfur atoms of the 12 doubly bridging thiolate ligands 
constitute a tetratruncated tetrahedron. Similarly, the terminal thiolate or selenolate 
ligands in [S4Cd10(SPh)16]4− are also easily substituted by halogen. Later on, a series 
of halide-substituted CCSCs [Cd10S4X4(SR)12]4− R = Ph or p-MeC6H4, (X = I or Br) 
were reported by the Adams group in 1999 (Figure 6.1d) [18]. So far, the larger  
Tn-type (n > 3) CCSCs have not been found, but the T4-, T5-, and T6-type

chalcogenide supertetrahedral clusters based on the high- and low-valence metal 
cations have been reported successively.
Apart from halogen, the terminal thiolate or selenolate ligands with μ1-type connec-
tion mode in CCSCs can also be easily substituted by phosphine ligands. In 1997, 
Fenske group prepared a CCSC [Cd10Se4(SePh)12(PPh3)4] (Figure 6.2a) by the reaction 
of [CdCl2(PPh3)2] with PhSeSiMe3 in diethyl ether [19]. The structure is similar to the 
[Se4Cd10(SPh)16]4− reported by the Dance group. The biggest difference is that the four 
terminal Cd atoms are coordinated by the PPh3 ligands in [Cd10Se4(SePh)12(PPh3)4]. 
By changing the reaction condition, another special CCSC [Cd16(SePh)32(PPh3)2] 
(Figure 6.2b) was also obtained. [19] In contrast to [Cd10Se4(SePh)12(PPh3)4], the four 
adamantanoid [Cd4Se6] cages of [Cd16(SePh)32(PPh3)2] are not directly fused together 
but are linked by SePh− ligands to form a [Cd16Se30] skeleton. This outer tetrahedron 
can be divided into four comer-sharing tetrahedra which contain the [Cd4Se6] cages. 
Later on, the Banin group also reported a similar CCSC [Cd10Se4(SePh)12(PPr3)4] with 
different phosphine ligands in 2001 [20].

6.2.2  Pn-Type Clusters
Penta-supertetrahedral clusters, denoted as Pn, can be formed by coupling four Tn 
supertetrahedral clusters onto the faces of an antisupertetrahedral cluster of the 
same order. In Pn-type clusters, the central antisupertetrahedral cluster (Cd4S) is a 
supertetrahedral cluster in which the positions of cations and anions have been 
exchanged. In 1990, Dance group firstly reported a series of atomically precise P1-
type CCSCs [ECd8(E′Ph)16]2− (E, E′ = S, Se, Te) prepared by the self-assembly of 
E′Ph (E′ = S, Se, Te), CdI2, and Na2E or NaEH (E = S, Se, Te) in alcohols/acetoni-
trile, wherein only [Et4N]2[SCd8(SePh)16](DMF) cluster was finally achieved by 
X-ray diffraction [21]. As shown in Figure 6.3a, the central S2− ion is coordinated to 
four inner Cd atoms, each connected through three doubly bridging SePh ligands to 
outer Cd atoms with terminal SePh ligands. All atoms have tetrahedral or part tetra-
hedral coordination. In 2008, another P1-type CCSC [SCd8(SPh)16]2−, containing 
pentasupertetrahedral or supertetrahedral anions and methylviologen cations, was

reported by Feng group (Figure 6.3b) [22]. Furthermore, up to now, P1-type CCSCs 
are the largest Pn CdS/Se monomolecular cluster.
6.2.3  Cn-Type Clusters
Capped clusters, generally denoted as Cn, can be defined as consisting of a core 
which is a regular fragment of the cubic ZnS-type lattice, together with four corner 
barrelanoid cages possessing the characteristics of the hexagonal wurtzite-type lat-
tice. For the C1-type CCSCs, one key structural feature is the presence of a core CdS4 
tetrahedron sharing its four S sites with four corner Cd4S4 barrelanoid cages. In 
1988, Dance group synthesized the first C1-type CCSC [Me4N]2[S4Cd17(SPh)28] by 
the treatment of a solution of PhSH and Et3N in acetonitrile with Cd(NO3)2 in ace-
tonitrile and Na2S in methanol, with alternating additions of the latter two reagents, 
followed by the addition of Me4NCl in methanol [23]. As shown in Figure 6.4a, in 
[Me4N]2[S4Cd17(SPh)28] cluster structure, a central Cd atom is connected to four 
quadruply bridging S2− ions, forming a T1-type pyramidal tetrahedron structure, 
and each S2− ion is connected to three Cd atoms, which are part of a Cd12

cuboctahedron. Four of the eight faces of the Cd12 cuboctahedron, and 12 of its 24 
edges, are internally spanned by μ4-S2− ligands. The 12 edges which are not so 
spanned are doubly bridged by thiolate ligands SPh, and these 12 μ1-SPh ligands 
constitute a tetratruncated tetrahedron. The four triangular faces of the Cd cubocta-
hedron, which are internally bridged by the μ4-S2− ligands, are also linked to exter-
nal Cd atoms by tripodal (μ1-SPh)3Cd(SPh) caps.
Subsequently, a C2-type CCSC [Cd32S14(SPh)36(DMF)4] with a 15 Å CdS core was 
reported by the Herron group in 1993 [26]. [Cd32S14(SPh)36(DMF)4] cluster was syn-
thesized by the recrystallization of the solid Cd10S4(SPh)12 from a solution of pyri-
dine and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF). The structural details reveal that the 
82-atom core is constructed from a large (~12 Å diameter), a roughly spherical 
chunk of the sphalerite form of bulk CdS whose requisite “dangling” surface bonds 
have been terminated by wurtzite-like (hexagonal) CdS units at four tetrahedral cor-
ners. Thus, the cluster looks like a large tetrahedron whose points have been capped 
by DMF solvent molecules and are neutral in charge. The cluster core is ~15 Å across 
(from the Cd atom at the vertex of the tetrahedron to the center of the opposite tet-
rahedral face). All of the edges of the core are covered with phenyl rings of bridging 
and capping thiophenolate ligands. In fact, the [Cd32S14(SPh)36(DMF)4] cluster is a 
larger homolog of the C1-type CCSC [Me4N]2[S4Cd17(SPh)28], and has all of the 
same structural features except for the capping of the Cd atoms that are at the verti-
ces of the tetrahedron is DMF and the appearance of four triply bridging sulfide ions 
in the center of the tetrahedral faces in this work.
Two years later, Weller and coworkers reported another C2-type CCSC 
Cd32S14(SCH2CH(OH)CH3)·4H2O (Figure 6.4b) [24]. This cluster was prepared by 
the reaction of Cd(ClO4)2, HSC3H6–OH, and H2S in a pH = 15 of aqueous solution 
at 100 °C. The cluster is a larger homolog of the Cd17S4(SCH2CH2OH)26 cluster, and 
its core structure is identical to the thiophenol-capped [Cd32S14(SPh)36(DMF)4] clus-
ter. The cluster framework is built up of 13 fused CdS adamantanoid cages, and the 
cluster is thus best described as a tetrahedral fragment of the cubic CdS phase (zinc 
blende) with open clefts running along the tetrahedral edges of the cluster. Cd is 
coordinated by oxygen at the cluster comers, most probably in the form of H2O.
Besides, a series of related CCSCs are those denoted as Cn,m (m = 1–4), which 
have the same composition as the corresponding Cn cluster, with m barrelanoid 
cages at the corners rotated by 60° (for n = 1, only one corner can be rotated) from 
their original position in the Cn cluster. Feng group reported a series of Cn,m 
CCSCs in 2005, the C2,2 cluster [Cd32S14(SPh)40]4− (Figure 6.4c), the C3,4 cluster 
[Cd54S32(SPh)48(H2O)4]4− (Figure  6.4d), and the [Cd54Se32(SPh)48(H2O)4]4−. The 
[Cd54S32(SPh)48(H2O)4]4− cluster is the largest II–VI quantum dot determined by 
single-crystal diffraction [25]. The size of this cluster as measured between corner 
metal sites is about 20 Å. This cluster can be described as a hybrid between cubic 
zinc blende-type core and hexagonal wurtzite-type corners. At the center of the 
cluster is a regular supertetrahedral [Cd10S20]20− cluster. After this, a superlattice of 
monodisperse (Me4N)4[Cd54Se32(SePh)48(DMF)4] nanocluster was synthesized 
using (Me4N)2[Cd(SePh)4] as a precursor through solvothermal treatment at 200 °C 
in DMF by Corrigan group in 2017 [27].

Supertetrahedral Clusters
6.3.1  Inorganic Open Frameworks
Organic thiol ligands in the synthesis of CCSCs usually act as the passivated ligands 
on the face of CCSCs, nevertheless, in some cases they also play roles as bridges at the 
vertexes via Cd-S-Cd bonding linking CCSCs to form open framework materials. In 
1986, Dance group reported a T2-CCSC-based three-dimensional (3D) open frame-
work [Cd4(SPh)8]n, in which each T2 cluster is vertex-linked to other four T2 clusters 
by sharing the μ2-SPh (Figure 6.5a) [28]. Whilst the crystal structure of [Cd4(SPh)8]n 
exhibits the α-cristobalite topology (Figure  6.5b). Subsequently, the use of 
4-­methylphenylthiolate results in the formation of a CrB4-type open framework 
[Cd4(SPhMe-4)8]n in 1987, in which tetrahedral boron sites are replaced by T2 clus-
ters. This framework also contains adamantanoid cage units, linked to four neigh-
bors by doubly bridging thiolate ligands in a 3D nonmolecular lattice (Figure 6.5c) [29]. 
In [Cd4(SPhMe-4)8]n, the tetrahedra are linked in closed cycles, not helices. Four-, six-, 
and eight-membered rings of adamantanoid tetrahedra occur, and the lattice contains 
a larger structural feature that is a polyhedral cavity, with the faces formed by four- and 
six-membered rings (Figure 6.5d). In another work, by using 4-bromophenylthiolate 
thiol ligand, a two-dimensional open framework [Cd8(SPhBr-4)16(DMF)3]n  
(Figure 6.5e,f), with a corrugated honeycomb-like topology, is obtained [30]. The 
DMF molecules involved in the coordination, and the specific steric interactions 
owing to the SPhBr-4 ligands, construct this two-dimensional topology.
To synthesize larger CCSCs, apart from the organic thiol ligands, a source of sul-
fur, such as CS2 or thiourea, must be incorporated into the reaction. In 2007, the 
Feng group developed new synthetic conditions that allowed the helical self-­
assembly of different-sized chalcogenide clusters into intertwined helical chains 
characteristic of the quartz-type net [31]. In this work, they focus on exploring how 
key synthetic parameters such as temperature, solvent, surface ligand type (-SAr), 
and S2− sources affect the size and network topology of resulting chalcogenide 
materials. Four new chiral CCSCs-based open frameworks CMF-n (CMF = capped 
metal-chalcogenide frameworks, n = 1, 2, 3, 5) were built with Cd(SC6H4Me-3)2 
(HSC6H4Me-3 = 3-methylbenzenethiol) and Cd(SC6H4Me-4)2 (HSC6H4-Me-4 = 
4-methylbenzenethiol) as starting material, and CS2 or thiourea as S2− sources at 
room temperature or under solvothermal conditions at 85 °C, respectively. In 
CMF-1, -3, and -5 framework structures, the first member of a series of P1-type 
CCSC [Cd8S(SC6H4Me-3)16]2− as the SBU is found (Figure 6.6a). Besides, the first 
member of a series of C1-type CCSCs [Cd17S4(SC6H4Me-4)28]2− in CMF-2 and 
[Cd17S4(SC6H4-Me-3)28]2− in CMF-3 are also found (Figure  6.6b,c), respectively. 
These topology frameworks are all built through the Cd-SAr-Cd linkage covalently 
joining the two adjacent clusters. Furthermore, CMF-1, -2, and -5 all show the  
β-quartz topology, and the CMF-3 simultaneously containing both P1- and C1-type 
CCSCs features a 3D moganite-type net (Figure 6.6d–f). In short, the helical self-
assembly of CCSCs is unprecedented and represents a key advancement in the 
development of novel CCSCs-based open frameworks material.

6  Synthesis and Assembly of Cadmium Chalcogenide Supertetrahedral Clusters

Subsequently, the highly electronegative fluorine-substituted surface ligand, 
3-fluorophenylthiolate, was used as organic ligands synthesizing a cubic chalcoge-
nide cluster [Cd8(SPhF-3)14(DMF)6(NO3)](NO3) (CMM-5), which is then used as the 
precursor for the synthesis of 3D covalent chalcogenide superlattices with a P1 tetra-
hedral node, [Cd8S(SC6H4F-3)12(SC6H4F-3)4/2] (CMF-8) (Figure  6.7a), and the 
α-quartz-type topology [32]. The building unit in CMF-8 contains the same number 
of cadmium sites and -SPhF-3 sites as the starting cubic cluster. One of the driving 
forces for the conversion of the cubic cluster into the tetrahedral cluster is the avail-
ability of the S2− source during the hydrothermal treatment of CMM-5 with thiourea. 
The strong affinity between Cd2+ and S2− leads to the formation of the SCd4 core that 
forms the basis for the conversion of the cubic [Cd8(SPhF-3)14(DMF)6]2+ cluster into 
the tetrahedral [Cd8S(SC6H4F-3)12(SC6H4F-3)4/2] cluster. In CMF-8, each P1 cluster is 
linked to four surrounding clusters through four bridging –SC6H4F-3 groups. The 
structure of CMF-8 has a threefold screw axis along the c-direction (Figure 6.7b) [32].
Similarly, the Weller group, using the four capping thiolate ligands at the ver-
texes of each cluster as linkage, constructed a 3D framework structure with a C1 
CCSC [Cd17S4(SCH2CH2OH)28]2− as secondary building unit (SBU) in 1995 
(Figure 6.8a) [33]. This extended framework has a double diamond topology, which 
is identical and unlinked to each other (Figure 6.8b). According to the above works, 
4-connected CCSCs-based open frameworks are more easily achievable, however, 
the 3-connected ones are rare. In 2008, Feng and coworkers reported a novel 3D 
(3,4)-connected framework material (CMF-4) built from [Cd17S4(SPhMe-3)28]2− C1 
CCSC (HSPhMe-3  =  3-methylbenzenethiol) (Figure  6.8c)  [34]. The framework 
structure has the boracite-type topology and contains alternating 3-connected C1 
CCSCs, with one terminating vertex, and 4-connected C1 CCSCs. The building 
block is the C1 CCSC, [Cd17S4(SPhMe-3)28]2−, which is the first member in a series 
of tetrahedral clusters denoted as capped (C) tetrahedral clusters. In the topology 
framework, the C1 CCSCs exhibit two different connectivities: 4-connected units 
similar to {B}O4 tetrahedra in boracite (Figure 6.8d), and 3-connected units with 
one terminating corner similar to {B}O3 triangles in boracite (Figure 6.8e). These 
two building blocks are assembled to form a 3D open framework (Figure 6.8f). 
The overall framework is negative, which is balanced by NH4
+ cations formed by 
the decomposition of thiourea.

In addition to C1 CCSCs, the larger C2 ones can also be assembled into open 
frameworks. In 2006, a C2-type CCSC, [Cd32S14(SPh)38]2− (Figure 6.9a), was success-
fully joined by their vertexes to form 3D covalent open frameworks (denoted COV-10 
and COV-11) with the double diamond topology (Figure 6.9b), using metal-chelate 
dyes (e.g. [M(1,10-phenanthroline)3]2+ (M = Fe2+, Ru2+), [Fe-(2,2′-bipyridine)3]2+) 
as templates [35]. COV-10 and COV-11 represent the first two examples of covalent 
open frameworks consisting of corner-sharing C2-type CCSCs. Both adopt the two-
fold interpenetrating diamond-type lattice with [Cd32S14(SPh)38]2− clusters at the 
tetrahedral node. The large size of the [Cd32S14(SPh)38]2− cluster leads to large extra-
framework space occupied by cationic metal complexes. The symmetrical differ-
ence between COV-10 and COV-11 might result from the disorder of the framework 
phenyl groups and the metal-chelate dyes. Because of the low charge density of Cn 
CCSCs, the frameworks of COV-10 and COV-11 have considerably lower charge 
density, therefore, the metal-chelate dyes with larger sizes and lower charge density 
are considered as templates for the synthesis of the covalent frameworks based on 
large [Cd32S14(SPh)38]2− clusters. In addition, the hydrophobic surface of the metal-
chelate dyes also matches well with the hydrophobic surface of the nanoclusters. In 
COV-10 and COV-11 frameworks, two adjacent [Cd32S14(SPh)38]2− SBUs are also 
joined by sharing the Cd-SAr-Cd linkages [35].
In addition to the above inorganic open frameworks based on CCSCs, Hyeon and 
coworkers reported an amusing Cd14Se13 magic-sized nanocluster in 2022 
(Figure  6.10)  [36], and then two chloride ions released in situ from the dichlo-
romethane solvent stabilize and linearly self-assemble the clusters via strong Cd−Cl 
bonds. In this work, by using a tertiary diamine as the ligand and halocarbon as the 
solvent, the Cd14Se13 nanocluster was synthesized through a reaction between cad-
mium acetate and bis(trimethylsilyl)selenide in the presence of N,N,N′,N′-
tetramethylethylenediamine (TMEDA) ligands in dichloromethane (DCM). 
Particularly, in the Cd14Se13 nanocluster, 13 Cd atoms exhibit tetrahedral coordina-
tion, whereas the remaining one Cd shows only a tri-coordination. The four inner 
Cd atoms, connected to the central Se atom, each achieve tetrahedral geometry by

bonding with three surface Se atoms. Of ten surface Cd atoms, six gain tetrahedral 
arrangement by bonding with two Se atoms and two nitrogen atoms of one TMEDA 
ligand. Three of the remaining four surface Cd atoms attain tetrahedral geometry by 
each binding with three Se atoms and one Cl atom. The Cl− ions play a critical role 
not only in providing fourth coordination to the surface Cd atoms, which renders 
the clusters neutral but also in stabilizing them through self-assembly. Furthermore, 
Mn2+ doping studies are carried out, revealing the number of dopants along with 
their positions in the Cd14Se13 clusters (Figure 6.10) [36].
6.3.2  Organic Open Frameworks
6.3.2.1  N-Donor Ligands
In addition to the CCSCs-based open frameworks in which the chalcogenolate clus-
ters are joined together through vertex-sharing of chalcogen atoms, there are a 
number of extended structures in which the clusters are linked by organic ligands. 
In most of these coordination polymers, the organic linker is a N-heterocyclic-based 
ligand. As early as 2002, the Feng group constructed a 3D photoluminescent super-
lattice (denoted as UCR-9) formed by linking the cubic [Cd8(SPh)12]4+ clusters with

tetradentate dye molecules (Figure 6.11a,b) [37]. A prominent structural feature in 
UCR-9 is the presence of a novel cadmium thiophenolate cluster. In the 
[Cd8(SPh)12]4+ cluster, eight cadmium ions are arranged at the corners of a cube, 
while 12 -SPh groups are distributed slightly off the center of each cubic edge. A 
sulfate group is located at the center of each cluster. Moreover, the oxidative cou-
pling from two 4,4′-trimethylenedipyridine units to a tetradentate dye molecule by 
in situ hydrothermal synthesis is essential in establishing the 3D framework in 
UCR-9. UCR-9 can be considered as layers of [Cd8(SPh)12]4+ clusters stacked along 
the c-axis (Figure 6.11c) [37]. Within each layer, [Cd8(SPh)12]4+ clusters are joined 
into a square pattern encircling large square pores formed by four [Cd8(SPh)12]4+ 
clusters. The linkage between adjacent layers is provided by benzene rings formed 
between two 4,4′-trimethylenedipyridine units.
Although the CCSCs could achieve connectivity of four, lower connectivities are 
often found, and this favors the formation of 1D coordination polymers. In 2005, a 
series of 1D assemblies (denoted as COV-q, where q is an integer indicating a par-
ticular structure type), containing cadmium-based capped clusters (C0, C1, C2,1 
and C2,2) alternating with 1,3-bis(4-pyridyl)propane (bpp) or 4,4′-bipyridine (bipy), 
were also reported by Feng group [38]. In these 1D assemblies, there are two types 
of Cd-32 clusters. The Cd-32 cluster in COV-1 (Cd32S14(SPh)36L4, L = terminal pyri-
dyl group) has only one barrelanoid cage rotated (C2,1) (Figure 6.12a). In compari-
son, the Cd-32 clusters in COV-2 (Cd32S14(SPh)38L2
2−) have two corners rotated

(C2,2) (Figure 6.12a). In addition to C2,1 and C2,2 clusters, other clusters such as 
Cd-17 (C1) and Cd-8 (C0 or P1) (Figure 6.12a) have also been synthesized as build-
ing blocks for different 1D assemblies. For 1D assemblies of Cd-32 clusters, two 
linking modes in which either four or two corners are used for cross-linking have 
been observed. In COV-1, adjacent C2,1 CdS clusters are joined together through 
two TMDPy ligands into a doubly bridged chain (Figure 6.12b). The replacement of 
all four corner -SPh groups by neutral ligands resulted in neutral chains (and clus-
ters) that were aligned in the same direction and packed together through noncova-
lent interactions. In comparison, adjacent C2,2 CdS clusters in COV-2 are joined 
together through only one TMDPy molecule into singly bridged chains (Figure 6.12c). 
Similar to Cd-32 clusters, Cd-17 and Cd-8 clusters can also be linked into 1D assem-
blies (Figure 6.12d,e). However, Cd-17 and Cd-8 only form singly bridged chains 
with alternating ligands and nanoclusters. For Cd-17 clusters in COV-3CdS, rigid 
4,4′-bipyridine (BPy) is used, whereas, for Cd-8 clusters in COV-4, flexible TMDPy 
is used as the bridging ligand.
Afterwards, in 2008, by using predesigned tetrahedral quadridentate linker 
tetrakis(4-pyridyloxymethylene)methane (TPOM) (Figure  6.13a) as the organic 
linker, tetrahedral P1 clusters ([Cd8S(SPh)16]2−) (Figure  6.13b) and C1 clusters 
([Cd17S4(SPh)28]2−) (Figure  6.13c) were assembled into beltlike (MCOF-9) 
(Figure 6.13d) or chainlike (MCOF-10) (Figure 6.13e) extended structures [39]. In 
the beltlike MCOF-9 structure, two corners of [Cd8S(SPh)16]2− cluster are occu-
pied by terminating SPh- groups, and the remaining two corners are replaced by 
N donors from organic linkers. The replacement of two corner SPh- groups by 
neutral linkers decreases the charge on each P1 cluster from −2 to 0, which leads 
to neutral one-dimensional structures that are aligned in the same direction and

packed together through noncovalent interactions. Unlike MCOF-9, which uses 
all four pyridyl groups in TPOM for cross-linking, the tetrahedral TPOM in 
MCOF-10 only uses two of its four pyridyl groups for cross-linking C1 clusters. 
Similarly, each chalcogenide cluster also uses its two corners for cross-linking.
In 2015, Zhang group reported a 1D semiconducting coordination polymer 
[Cd8S(SPh)14(DMF)(bpy)]n with helical chains interlinked with the 4,4′-bipyridine 
(bpy) ligand (Figure 6.14a) [40]. In cluster [Cd8S(SPh)14(DMF)] (P1-type), seven of 
the Cd atoms are tetrahedrally coordinated and chemically bonded with four S 
atoms (or three S and one O atom). One Cd atom is bonded with four S atoms and 
coordinated/bonded to one O atom in a DMF molecule (Figure 6.14b). Generally, 
the coordination bond of Cd–O(DMF) could be replaced more easily than the for-
mer Cd–SPh bond with a strong covalent nature. The two terminal DMF molecules 
in the cluster [Cd8S(SPh)14(DMF)] were replaced by bpy linkers, which coordinated 
with terminal Cd atoms via N donors. Each cluster was twice ligated by the bpy link-
ers, building a 1D helical chain structure (Figure 6.14c) [40].
A small number of 2D CCSCs-based extended structures have also been reported. 
Feng and coworkers use two bifunctional organic ligands (TMDPy = 4,4′-trimethyl-
enedipyridine; BPEA = 1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)ethane) (Figure 6.15a) as the organizing 
force, semiconducting tetrahedral chalcogenide C2,1 clusters, Cd32S14(SPh)36 
(Figure 6.15b), have been assembled into two 2D layers (COV-5 CdS-TMDPy, COV-7 
CdS-BPEA) (Figure 6.15c,d) in 2006, respectively [41]. The common structural pat-
tern in these two-dimensional co-assemblies is the presence of a dimeric unit 
formed by connecting two Cd-32 clusters through two ligands. The formation of 
such dimeric units leaves four “free” corners (for each dimer) for crosslinking with

other dimers. Each dimer behaves like a pseudotetrahedral unit and is joined to four 
adjacent dimers through four cross-linking ligands to form two-dimensional arrays. 
Thus, these two-dimensional patterns result from the combined use of single and 
double organic bridges between inorganic nanoclusters.
Similarly, in 2009, the Zhang group reported a 2D assembly layer ([Cd10Te4 
(SPhMe-4)12(TMDPy)2]n) with bifunctional organic ligand 4,4′-trimethylenedipyri-
dine (TMDPy) (Figure 6.16a) as linkage, and Cd10Te4 thiolate cluster (Figure 6.16b) 
as structural motif [42]. In this assembly layer, each supertetrahedral T3 cluster is 
connected through four TMDPy ligands by metal–ligand coordination bonds. The 
cluster core, which comprises four adamantane cages, each of which is formed by 
three sulfur, three tellurium, and four cadmium atoms, is a macrotetrahedral frag-
ment of the sphalerite structure. The four nitrogen atoms of the TMDPy ligands 
occupy the apex positions of the resultant tetrahedra. The cadmium atoms have a 
distorted tetrahedral environment, coordinated by the sulfur atoms of the μ1-SPh− 
and the μ3-Te2− as well as the nitrogen atoms of TMDPy ligands, respectively. Each 
TMDPy as a bifunctional ligand links to two Cd10Te4 cluster molecules by the coor-
dination of nitrogen atoms. The layer structure contains square rings from the ab 
plane (Figure 6.16c), and the interdigitation of the Cd10Te4 clusters and the square

the layer material has been found to be strongly photoluminescent.
Lin group reported a new 2D inorganic–organic hybrid material, formulated as 
Cd17S4(SPh)25B(im)4 (SPh = benzenethiolate, im = imidazolate), which was synthe-
sized using a tetrakis(imidazolyl)borate ([B(im)4]−) ligand (Figure 6.17a) linked to a 
Cd17S4(SPh)25 cluster (C1) under solvothermal conditions [43]. According to single-
crystal structural analysis, all the cadmium atoms in the cluster are tetrahedrally 
coordinated (Figure 6.17b). The S sites in the cluster can be classified into two dif-
ferent categories. First, there are four tetrahedrally coordinated S sites at the core of 
the cluster, which are produced by the decomposition of thiourea under solvother-
mal conditions. The second type of S site is located at the corners and edges of the 
C1 cluster, which are terminal and bridging SPh groups. In each C1 nanocluster, 
one corner is occupied by the terminal SPh group, and the remaining three corners 
are occupied by nitrogen atoms from B(im)4
− ligands. On the other side, each 
3-­connected mode of B(im)4
− ligand connects with three cadmium sulfide clusters 
to form the cluster-organic framework (Figure 6.17c) [43].
6.3.2.2  Other Organic Ligands
In terms of the organic linkages of CCSCs-based open frameworks, apart from the 
above N-heterocyclic-based ligands, some other organic ligands can also be used as 
linkage. This includes the methyldithiocarbonate, CH3OCS2
−, which crosslinks 
cadmium-containing C1 clusters (Figure 6.18a) into a 3D structure ([S4Cd17(SPh)24 
(CH3OCS2)4/2]n·nCH3OH) (Figure  6.18b) with the double diamond topology 
reported by Jin group in 1996 [44]. Its repeat unit is a 17-nuclear cadmium cluster, 
and each unit is linked to four surrounding aggregates through four CH3OCS2
− 
ligands. In the 17-nuclear cadmium unit, a central cadmium atom is connected to 
four quadruply bridging S2− ions, each of which is connected to three cadmium

atoms which are linked to an external cadmium atom through PhS− ligands 
(Figure 6.18c). The external cadmium is also coordinated with a CH3OCS2
− ligand. 
The ligand CH3OCS2
− in the structure is important and unusual and is formed in 
situ by CS2 and CH3OH and connects two 17 nuclear units through two sulfur atoms.
6.4  ­Properties
CCSCs-based open framework materials usually display not only the inherent prop-
erties of the individual cluster and molecular linker but also the novel collective 
behaviors due to the various interactions between the cluster and linker units. The 
combination of molecular linkers and clusters is expected to produce synergetic 
effects.
6.4.1  Photoluminescent Properties
Besides as a linker, the multifunctional ligands can also endow novel properties to 
CCSCs-based framework materials. For example, the photoluminescent properties 
of clusters can be enhanced if the organic molecular linkers serve to absorb photon 
energies and transfer them to inorganic clusters. For the 3D photoluminescent 
framework UCR-9 formed by linking [Cd8(SPh)12]4+ clusters with the tetradentate 
dye molecules (1,2,4,5-tetra(4-pyridyl)-benzene), one prominent emission peak 
occurs at 580 nm, which is likely due to the S2− to Cd2+ charge transfer, similar to that 
observed for the bulk CdS [37]. In addition, UCR-9 also displays a strong doublet at 
415 and 440 nm likely originating from the dye molecules. Both the 580 nm and the

doublet emission have about the same intensity when excited at 370 nm. Below 
370 nm, the doublet is stronger, and above 370 nm, the 580 nm peak becomes more 
intense. Because the emission from the dye molecule at about 440 nm is close to its 
absorption, the maximum facilitated to produce emission at 580 nm, so the absorp-
tion of the dye molecule and the subsequent energy transfer can enhance the photo-
luminescent properties of the cluster.

can be assigned to the combination of metal-centered (ds/dp) states and Te2− → Cd2+ 
and p-MeC6H4S− → Cd2+ transitions. Similarly, the 2D inorganic–organic hybrid 
material Cd17S4(SPh)25B(im)4 (SPh = benzenethiolate, im = imidazolate) displays a 
green luminescence with a peak maximum at 546 nm upon excitation at 390 nm 
(Figure 6.19c).
6.4.2  Photodegradation of Organic Dyes
The porous CCSCs-based framework materials with large specific surface area is an 
excellent catalyst. In 2014, Zhang group presented a ternary chalcogenolate cluster of 
Cd6Ag4(SPh)16(DMF)4 and its 3D microporous assembly of {[Cd6Ag4(SPh)16](bpe)2} 
interlinked with rigid bpe (trans-1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)ethylene) [45]. The microporous 
framework showed broad absorption at wavelengths of 200–600 nm, with a maxi-
mum at 305 nm and a shoulder peak at 420 nm (Figure  6.20a). Given the wide 
­bandgap and the strong visible absorption shown by the cluster Cd6Ag4(SPh)16 
(DMF)4 and microporous framework {[Cd6Ag4(SPh)16](bpe)2}, both are expected to 
be active photocatalysts. The clusters Cd6Ag4(SPh)16(DMF)4 reduced the dye rhoda-
mine B (RhB) concentration by 95% after illumination for 180 minutes. An aqueous 
dispersion of the microporous framework {[Cd6Ag4(SPh)16](bpe)2} was an effective

photocatalyst; it reduced the concentration of RhB by 95% after illumination for 
90 minutes (Figure 6.20b). The improved photocatalytic activity of the microporous 
framework might be attributable to its hybrid structure and broad visible absorption, 
which facilitate the efficient use of incoming energy for the degradation. Subsequently, 
this group reported a 1D semiconducting coordination polymer [Cd8S(SPh)14(DMF)
(bpy)]n with helical chains interlinked with the 4,4′-bipyridine (bpy) ligand, which 
was effective in supporting the photodegradation of RhB and methylene blue (MB) 
in aqueous solutions [40]. With [Cd8S(SPh)14(DMF)(bpy)]n, the concentrations of 
RhB and MB were reduced by ∼70% at 90 minutes and by 95% after 180 minutes, 
under white light illumination (Figure 6.20c,d).

of CCSCs and CCSC-based frameworks, and exploration of their properties and 
applications. Undoubtedly, the development of CCSCs and CCSC-based frame-
works is complementary. Although many CCSCs and CCSC-based frameworks 
bearing different sizes, types, and compositions have been built, and various synthe-
sis strategies have been presented, to date, only a few types of organic ligands have 
been successfully introduced into CCSC-based frameworks. To develop new frame-
work structures, synthetic methods using novel organic ligands should be extended 
and innovated. Furthermore, the CCSCs and CCSC-based framework semiconduc-
tor materials show significant potential in the further development of functional 
nanomaterials, but only a few properties have been explored. Therefore, the poten-
tial applications in optical/electronic devices should be vigorously extended. Of 
course, it is undeniable that the composition–structure–property correlation of 
CCSC chemistry should be further pursued to guide the optimization of their prop-
erties for various applications.

7.1  ­Introduction
Fe–S clusters are ancient and ubiquitous cofactors in biological systems across all 
forms of life and are involved in many life-sustaining cellular processes such as respi-
ration, enzyme catalysis, electron transport, RNA modification, DNA replication, and 
gene expression [1–4]. The Fe–S clusters are protected by proteins by coordinating the 
Fe atoms to the cysteine residues [5, 6]. In addition, histidine, serine, and aspartic acid 
residues can also participate in Fe–S cluster coordination [7]. The reducing Fe and S 
were abundant in the early earth; thus, Fe–S clusters are believed to spontaneously 
assemble into primitive biological macromolecules by using suitable ligands. Once 
oxygen became prevalent in the atmosphere, nature preserved Fe–S clusters by mak-
ing adaptations to protect them from degradation by oxygen, thereby highlighting the 
indispensable roles these cofactors play in supporting life [8].
Fe–S clusters have been most widely investigated for their functional biological 
roles, specifically for electron transfer, catalysis, sulfur donation, and sensing [9]. 
Their redox-active and catalytic properties, structural diversity and modular nature, 
abundance of Fe and S, and stability under mild conditions have made them useful 
resources for a variety of applications including synthetic small molecules, maquettes 
and artificial proteins, biomimetic materials, and therapeutic development [10–13]. 
Meanwhile, the Fe–S clusters are also functional outside of a proteinaceous environ-
ment. However, they are quite low in quantity and exhibit irreversible deactivation in 
the presence of oxygen [14, 15]. Over the last several decades, biomimetic inorganic 
chemistry has focused on the synthesis of Fe–S cluster analogs with non-genetically 
encoded sterically hindered thiolates to mimic their structure and function as well as 
improve their stability in air conditions [12, 16–18]. Furthermore, the Fe–S cluster 
mimics pave the way for more detailed studies on the synthetic procedures and 
potential catalytic activity of Fe–S clusters, thus providing new insights to elucidate 
the relationship between properties and electronic structures of biological Fe–S 
cofactors.
In nature, the Fe–S cluster mainly exists as rhombic [2Fe2S] clusters, cuboidal 
[3Fe4S] clusters, and cuboidal [4Fe4S] clusters (Figure 7.1a). The cuboidal [4Fe4S]

clusters can be assembled from two [2Fe2S] clusters, whereas the [3Fe4S] clusters 
can be assembled from [4Fe4S] clusters through the loss of one Fe atom  [19]. 
Interestingly, one complex Fe–S cluster, [FeFe]‑hydrogenase, which consists of one 
[2Fe2S] catalytic subsite linked to a [4Fe4S] cluster via a single cysteinyl thiolate, has 
received more and more attention due to its excellent photocatalytic property of H2 
production (Figure 7.1b) [20–23]. Most of the Fe–S cluster mimics are associated 
with [FeFe]‑hydrogenase, with the aim of designing an artificial photocatalytic sys-
tem for light-driven proton reduction. Therefore, [2Fe2S] clusters and [4Fe4S] clus-
ters in [FeFe]‑hydrogenase will be the representatives of Fe–S clusters in this chapter.
[FeFe]-hydrogenase commonly contains first, second, and outer coordination 
spheres, each playing a very important role in the photocatalytic process [24]. The 
first coordination sphere refers to the ligands directly bound to the diiron core 
[FeFe], which influences electron density, redox potential, binding ability, and steric 
hindrance of the metal center. Strong-field ligands such as terminal cyanide (CN−) 
or carbon monoxide (CO) are present in the first coordination sphere to ensure low-
valent iron sites. The second coordination sphere describes functional groups of the 
azadithiolate bridged ligands (aza-propane-1,3-dithiolate, adt) that react with the 
substrate. They play a fundamental role in moving electrons through the [4Fe4S] 
clusters and shuttling protons via amino acids and the amine bridgehead of the 
active site. The outer coordination sphere is normally >4 Å from the metal and 
encompasses the entire remaining scaffold of [FeFe]-hydrogenase. Therefore, the

[FeFe]-hydrogenase mimics can be fine-tuned by engineering each of these coordi-
nation spheres in the following ways: (i) the replacement of CO in the first coordina-
tion sphere with electron-rich phosphine ligands or N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) 
ligands to stabilize the hydride intermediates, provide photostability, and improve 
electron density of diiron core [FeFe]; (ii) the addition of functional groups or reac-
tive structures at dithiolate bridged ligands to assist the heterolytic H2 cleavage/
formation and proton-coupled electron transfer reactions (PCET); (iii) the assembly 
with heterogeneous supports to create and modulate an analogous protein environ-
ment around [FeFe]-hydrogenase mimics that can improve their stability and solu-
bility in aqueous solutions.
In this chapter, we first present the modification of the first and second coordina-
tion sphere of [2Fe2S] and [4Fe4S] clusters with phosphine ligands, NHC ligands, 
aliphatic dithiolate bridged ligands, aromatic dithiolate bridged ligands. Then, the 
assembly of Fe–S clusters into polynuclear Fe–S complexes, coordination polymers 
(CPs), or heterogeneous supports through functional thiolate bridged ligands is 
introduced in the second part. The effects of the modification and assembly on the 
photocatalytic property are discussed in the third part. This chapter presents a com-
prehensive overview of the Fe–S cluster modification and assembly methods to 
­provide insights for the future development of Fe–S cluster analogs with desired 
properties.
7.2  ­The Modification of the First and Second 
Coordination Sphere on Fe–S Clusters
7.2.1  The Modification of the First Coordination Sphere by 
Phosphine Ligands
Replacing CO or CN− ligands with electron-rich ligands on the diiron core [FeFe] is 
a very promising way to improve the electrochemical behaviors and stability of 
[2Fe2S] clusters. Among the stronger donors, phosphine ligands are most com-
monly used because (i) phosphine ligands are easily synthesized; (ii) they possess 
similar electronic effects to those of CO or CN− ligands in the natural enzymes;  
(iii) they can improve the stability and raise the electron density of the diiron core 
[FeFe]; (iv) the electronic and steric effects of phosphine ligands can be readily regu-
lated by changing their P atom-attached organic groups [25–27]. Jiang and cowork-
ers reported two [2Fe2S] clusters [FeFe](μ-SCH(CH2CH3)CH2S)(CO)5(PMe3) and 
[FeFe](μ-SCH(CH2CH3)CH2S)(CO)5(P(CH3O)3) (1 and 2 in Figure 7.2) to investi-
gate the influence of phosphine ligand substitution [25]. The spectroscopic methods 
and single-crystal X-ray analysis revealed that P(CH3O)3 ligand has less steric effect 
on the coordination geometry of the Fe center than the PMe3, resulting in better 
electrocatalytic activity of [2Fe2S] cluster 2. Das and Durgaprasad reported six 
mono-phosphine substituted [2Fe2S] clusters by the reactions of [FeFe](μ-6,7-qdt)
(CO)6, [FeFe](μ-diph-6,7-qdt)(CO)6, [FeFe](μ-btdt)(CO)6 with PPh3 or P(OEt)3, 
respectively (3–8 in Figure 7.2) [26]. When increasing the amount of P(OEt)3, three

di-substituted [2Fe2S] clusters were successfully afforded (9–11 in Figure 7.2). The 
phosphine ligands increased the electron density of these [2Fe2S] clusters evidenced 
by the shifts in the infrared carbonyl stretching frequencies, and in the reduction 
potentials. Sun and coworkers used water-soluble phosphine ligand 3,7-­diacetyl- 
1,3,7-triaza-5-phosphabicyclo[3.3.1]-nonane (DAPTA) to replace one CO ligand on 
the [FeFe](μ-pdt)(CO)6 (μ-pdt = propanedithiolate) to improve its solubility (12 in 
Figure  7.2)  [27]. Furthermore, various phosphine ligands with functionalized 
groups like fullerene and ferrocene (Fc) were used to modulate the electronic struc-
ture of the [FeFe] active sites [28–31].
Bidentate phosphine ligands provide various binding modes on the [2Fe2S] clus-
ters, which would flourish the chemistry of Fe–S cluster analogs [32–35]. Talarmin 
and coworkers treated the [FeFe](μ-pdt)(CO)6 with dppe (Ph2PCH2CH2PPh2) ligand 
to afford the [FeFe](μ-pdt)(CO)4(dppe) cluster (13 in Figure 7.2) by refluxing in tolu-
ene [34]. The two P atoms of dppe ligand coordinate to one iron atom in a basal-
apical position and help stabilize the terminal hydride intermediates at low 
temperatures. In addition, the bidentate phosphine ligands can also act as a bridged 
ligand to two Fe sites in one or two [2Fe2S] clusters, and the latter will be discussed 
in the second part [36–38].

7.2.2  The Modification of the First Coordination Sphere by NHC and 
Chelated N-Based Ligands
NHC ligands show superior activity than their corresponding phosphine analogs 
and are thus widely utilized as surrogates for phosphines to prepare [2Fe2S] clus-
ters [39, 40]. These can be attributed to the stronger σ-donation but with negligible 
π-accepting ability and tunable electronic and steric properties of NHC ligands [41, 
42]. Hu and coworkers treated three [2Fe2S] clusters ([FeFe][(μ-SCH2)2X](CO)6, 
X = O, NBu-t, and NC6H4OMe-p) with N-heterocyclic carbene IMes (IMes = 1,3-bis 
(mesityl)imidazole-2-ylidene) to afford the corresponding mono-NHC-containing 
[2Fe2S] clusters ([FeFe][(μ-SCH2)2X](CO)5(IMes), X = O, NBu-t, and NC6H4OMe-p) 
(14–16 in Figure 7.3) [43]. The [2Fe2S] clusters 14–16 are air-stable and have been 
fully characterized by X-ray crystallography, elemental analysis, and spectroscopy. 
Interestingly, the IMes ligands lie in apical positions of [2Fe2S] cluster 14, whereas 
they reside in the basal positions of [2Fe2S] clusters 15 and 16 in order to avoid the 
strong steric repulsions between the N-attached bulky t-Bu and p-C6H4OMe groups 
and bulky IMes ligand. Chelated N-based ligands, such as 2,2′-bipyridine (bipy) and 
2,2′-bipyrimidine (bpym) with strong π-accepting ability, chelating ability, and 
redox-activity, have also been utilized for replacing CO ligands of [2Fe2S] clus-
ters  [44]. Four [2Fe2S] clusters [FeFe](μ-pdt)(CO)4(κ2-bipy), [FeFe](μ-pdt)(CO)4 
(κ2-bpym), [FeFe](μ-bdt)(CO)4(κ2-bipy) (bdt = benzene-1,2-dithiloate), and [FeFe]
(μ-bdt)(CO)4(κ2-bpym) (17–20 in Figure 7.3) were prepared by Jones and coworkers, 
in which the N-based ligands bipy and bpym coordinated to a single iron in a

basal–basal mode [44]. The bpym-modified [2Fe2S] clusters 18 and 20 exhibited 
more positive reduction potentials than that of bipy-modified [2Fe2S] cluster 19 due 
to the lower energy of empty π* orbitals of bpym. Furthermore, the [2Fe2S] clusters 
with functionalized cysteinyl or CN groups were designed and prepared to improve 
their H2 evolution performance [45, 46].
7.2.3  The Modification of the Second Coordination Sphere by 
Aliphatic Dithiolate Bridged Ligands
The aliphatic dithiolate bridged ligands (–SCH2XCH2S–) were widely developed to 
modify the electron density, redox potentials, steric hindrance as well as the water 
solubility and H2 evolution performance of the [2Fe2S] clusters by changing the 
central atoms (X = C, N, O, or S) in the aliphatic dithiolate ligands, and/or function-
alizing the aliphatic dithiolate ligands [16, 20]. Among these [2Fe2S] clusters, the 
C-functionalized pdt has attracted particular interest due to the easy modifications 
by functional transformation reactions [47]. For example, Wu and coworkers intro-
duced a hydrophilic sulfonate group propanesulfonate attached to the pdt ligands to 
improve the water solubility of [2Fe2S] clusters (21 and 22 in Figure 7.4) [48, 49].

Darensbourg and coworkers reported a [2Fe2S] cluster bearing carboxylic groups on 
the aliphatic dithiolate ligands (23 and 24 in Figure  7.4), which can be further 
attached to amino-functionalized electrode surfaces via carbodiimide-promoted 
acylation for electrocatalysis [50].
Recent studies have proved that the bridgehead N heteroatom in the adt ligands 
plays an important role in the heterolytic activation of hydrogen catalyzed by the 
[FeFe]-hydrogenases [51]. Furthermore, the [2Fe2S] clusters with N-substituted adt 
ligands are thought to serve as starting materials for modifying functionalized 
groups, such as fullerene, sulfanilic acid, and phorphyrin to modulate the electron 
density, water solubility of the [2Fe2S] clusters, and obtain light-driven-type [2Fe2S] 
clusters  [52–54]. Hu and coworkers treated [FeFe](μ-LiS)2(CO)6 with a series of 
N,N-bis(chloromethyl)amines RN(CH2Cl)2 to form N-substituted adt-type [2Fe2S] 
clusters [FeFe][(μ-SCH2)2NR](CO)6 (R = CH2CO2Et, C6H4C(O)Me-p, C6H4CO2Me-p, 
C6H4SCN-p) (25–28 in Figure 7.4). The crystallographic results revealed that the 
N-substitutes in [2Fe2S] cluster 25 are located in an equatorial position, whereas the 
N-substitutes in [2Fe2S] clusters 26 and 27 lie in an axial position. This is presuma-
bly because of the different electronic and steric effects of the N-substituted ali-
phatic and aromatic groups [55]. Wu and coworkers reported a series N-substituted 
adt-type [2Fe2S] cluster based on [FeFe][(μ-adt)C6H4I-4](CO)6 by the Sonogashira 
reaction (29–37 in Figure 7.4) [56]. The triple bond with linear geometry acts as an 
effective bridge to anchor various functionalized groups ranging from electron-
donating to electron-accepting, or even coordinative groups. All these N-substituted 
adt-type [2Fe2S] clusters show the electrocatalytic property of hydrogen reduction, 
but the reductional potential for the electron transfer step was significantly affected 
by the N-substitutes.
In addition, the [2Fe2S] clusters containing 2-oxa-1,3-dithiolate (odt) or thiadithi-
olate (tdt) ligands were also prepared by Hu and coworkers [57–59]. However, the 
odt/tdt-type [2Fe2S] clusters can only be modified by replacing CO ligands due to 
the coordination saturation of O and S atoms.
7.2.4  The Modification of the Second Coordination Sphere by 
Aromatic Dithiolate Bridged Ligands
Interestingly, using aromatic dithiolate with appropriately substituted groups as 
bridged ligands in [2Fe2S] clusters are a promising design strategy to improve the 
stability and isolate the hydride intermediates as compared to the aliphatic dithi-
olate bridged complexes [60]. Although aromatic dithiolate-bridged complexes do 
not resemble the active site of [FeFe]-hydrogenases in structure, it is still of great 
importance to focus on this series of complexes due to the following reasons: (i) the 
structural robustness and rigidity can improve the integrity of [2Fe2S] clusters, sta-
bilize hydride intermediates, and avoid dimerization or degradation by loss of CO 
ligands; (ii) the substituents at the conjugated bridges can tune the redox properties 
of [2Fe2S] clusters; (iii) the exhibition of reversible reduction processes in the 
absence of substrate; (iv) the possibility of incorporation, encapsulation, or chem-
isorption in supramolecular scaffolds, heterogeneous supports, or electrodes for 

7  The Modification and Assembly of Fe–S Clusters

subsequent application in electro-/photocatalytic processes. For example, a phenyl 
group in the [2Fe2S] cluster [FeFe](μ-bdt)(CO)6 (38 in Figure 7.5) showed a signifi-
cant effect on the stability of the reduced forms and facilitated the redox reactions 
by lowing the potential difference between successive metal oxidation states in the 
catalytic cycle [61]. The electron density can be diverted from the diiron core [FeFe] 
into the aromatic portion and a subsequent lessening of the π back-bonding from 
the metal into the M−CO bond, thus lowering the reduction potential [62]. In addi-
tion, the reduction potential can be further shifted to more positive values by the 
introduction of electron-withdrawing flouro/chloro substituents [63–65]. In 2012, 
Liu and coworkers reported an aromatic dithiolate-bridged [2Fe2S] cluster func-
tionalized with Fc groups, which was synthesized via the reaction of [FeFe](hydro-
quinone)(CO)6 cluster and ferrocenyl formy chloride (FcOCCl) (39 in Figure 7.5) [66]. 
The incorporation of Fc groups does not change the reduction process as those of 
[FeFe](μ-bdt)(CO)6 and [FeFe](hydroquinone)(CO)6 but can be employed to cali-
brate the electron numbers involved in the reduction of [2Fe2S] cluster 39. A new 
series of aromatic dithiolate-bridged [2Fe2S] clusters was reported by Ott and 
­coworkers, which contained terminal mono-dentate phosphine ligands covalently 
linked to aromatic dithiolate ligands (40–43 in Figure 7.5) [24]. These [2Fe2S] clus-
ters were synthesized based on [FeFe](mcbdt)(CO)6 (mcbdt = benzene-1,2-dithiol-
3-carboxylic acid) cluster through the covalent reaction with amino-phosphine 
ligands to form amide bonds. Theoretical calculations revealed that the rotation of 
the Fe(CO)2P unit is hindered by introducing a rigid covalent link between the 
­phosphine and the aromatic dithiolate bridged ligands, which could stabilize the

reactive intermediates in the catalytic cycle of hydrogen evolution. Reek and cow-
orkers immobilized the [FeFe](mcbdt)(CO)6 cluster onto fluorine-doped tin oxide 
(FTO) electrodes, which performed hydrogen evolution from aqueous environ-
ments at mild overpotentials [67]. Therefore, the abundant substituent groups on 
the phenyl group not only optimized the proton reduction property of the [2Fe2S] 
cluster but also immobilized the [2Fe2S] cluster on various supports such as MOFs, 
conductive electrodes, and polymers for electro-/photocatalysis in aqueous solution.
Naphthalene-1,8-dithiolate, which provides a three-atom spacer between the sulfur 
atoms, represents another useful aromatic dithiolate bridged ligands for [2Fe2S] clus-
ters due to its rigid structure, tunable electronic properties, and easy functionalization 
by substituents on the naphthalene ring. Additionally, the sterically demanding sub-
stituents in the 2- and 7-positions of the naphthalene may provide steric protection to 
the [2Fe2S] active sites, thereby increasing their stability [68, 69]. For instance, Tilley 
and coworkers prepared three naphthalene dithiolate-bridged [2Fe2S] clusters with 
different substituents for the proton reduction of p-toluensulfonic acid. The electron-
poor [FeFe](1,8-S2-2,4,5,7-Cl4C10H2)(CO)6 cluster requires a lower overpotential at 
similar current in comparison to [FeFe](1,8-S2C10H6)(CO)6 and electron-rich [FeFe]
(1,8-S2-2,7-tBu2C10H4)(CO)6 cluster (44–46 in Figure  7.5)  [70]. Liu and coworkers 
investigated the different effects on the electrochemical behaviors of [2Fe2S] clusters 
by changing the substituents on the naphthalene-bridged ligands [71–73]. They have 
found that the naphthalene dithiolate-bridged [2Fe2S] clusters adopt completed ECE 
(electrochemical, chemical, and electrochemical) and EE (electrochemical and elec-
trochemical) mechanisms in their electron transfer. The conjugating effect of the 
naphthalene group can lower the electron density on the [FeFe] sites and stabilize the 
monoanion after accepting the first electron, thus making the EE mechanism domi-
nant. By using 1,8-naphthalic anhydride (NAH) as the bridged ligand, Zhou and cow-
orkers reported a [FeFe](NAH)(CO)6 cluster (47 in Figure 7.5) with more positive 
reduction potentials than most of the other [2Fe2S] analogs [74]. Later on, Peneva and 
Weigand and coworkers further stabilized the reduced species and lowered the reduc-
tion potentials of [2Fe2S] clusters by using naphthalene monoimide (NMI and per-
ylene monoimide derivatives as aromatic dithiolate bridged ligands  [75, 76]. 
Furthermore, various aromatic groups, including 1,1′-binaphthalene, phenanthrene, 
diphenyl, fullerene, carborane, as well as N/Si-heterocyclic pyrazine, quinoxaline, and 
silafluorene were used as bridged-ligands for [2Fe2S] clusters to tune their stereoelec-
tronic, stability, electrochemical, and catalytic properties [77–86].
7.2.5  The Modification of the First and Second Coordination Sphere 
by Photosensitive Ligands
The molecular photosensitizers (PS) such as Ru, Ir, and Re complexes, as well as 
porphyrin, have been covalently attached to [2Fe2S] clusters for photocatalytic H2 
evolution. The PS-[2Fe2S] complexes promote fast intramolecular electron transfers 
and charge separation and can avoid recombination between the redox states 
­generated during the photocatalytic cycle [87, 88]. The molecular engineering of 
PS-[2Fe2S] complexes is based on two different design strategies: (i) the PS is directly 

7  The Modification and Assembly of Fe–S Clusters

attached to one of the diiron sites by phosphine ligands; (ii) the [2Fe2S] clusters and 
PS are linked via the organic dithiolate bridged ligands. In 2003, Sun and coworkers 
covalently attached a ruthenium(tris)bipyridine type of PS to a [2Fe2S] cluster 
through the dithiol bridged ligands (48 in Figure  7.6)  [89]. A [Ru(terpy)2]2+ 
(terpy = 2,2′:6′,2″-terpyridine) was chosen as the PS due to the geometric advan-
tages. The [FeFe](μ-adt)(CO)6 cluster with N heteroatom could easily post-modify 
and show promising performance of H2 evolution, which was selected as the [2Fe2S] 
cluster. Furthermore, the PS group and the [2Fe2S] cluster were linked by an acety-
lenic linker, which not only showed a spatial separation effect but also prolonged 
the lifetime of the excited state of [Ru(terpy)2]2+ so that electron transfer to the iron 
portion could occur. Later on, a Ru(bpy)3
2+ PS was directly attached to one of the 
iron sites through phosphine ligands to form [FeFe](μ-pdt)(CO)5[PPh2(C6H4CCbpy)
Ru(bpy)2]2+ cluster (49 in Figure 7.6) [90]. The redox properties of [2Fe2S] cluster 49 
have been modified for more favorable values in order to fulfill the electronic 
requirements for electron transfer from the Ru PS to the diiron centers. In addition, 
Ir and Re complexes have been also designed to modify the [2Fe2S] clusters for 
improving the photocatalytic performance of H2 production [91–93]. The neutral 
tetraphenylporphyrin (TPP) group can absorb as much as 46% of solar energy. 
Meanwhile, the lifetime of the excited state of TPP is much longer than that of com-
mon RuII-based PS. Therefore, the TPP group was undoubtedly attached to the 
[2Fe2S] clusters through the dithiol-bridged ligands or phosphine ligands to opti-
mize the photocatalytic activity of H2 production  [94–97]. Interestingly, Sun  
and coworkers reported a noncovalent assembly of a Zn-TPP PS and a pyridyl-­
functionalized [2Fe2S] cluster (50 in Figure  7.6)  [98]. This noncovalent system

7.3  ­Th e Assembl y of F e–S Cluster

showed even faster electron transfer from the excited singlet state of the TPP group 
to the diiron sites than the covalently linked [2Fe2S] cluster due to the less charge 
recombination via complex dissociation.
7.3  ­The Assembly of Fe–S Clusters
7.3.1  The Assembly of Fe–S Clusters to Form Polynuclear  
Fe–S Complexes
The substituted ligands can not only improve the photo/electro-catalytic perfor-
mance of H2 production and stability of [2Fe2S] clusters but also assemble several 
[FeFe] units in one system [99, 100]. Sun and coworkers prepared polynuclear Fe–S 
complexes with rigid dithiolate bridged ligands [101]. Two polynuclear Fe–S com-
plexes {[FeFe](CO)6}2(μ,μ-pbtt) (μ,μ-pbtt  =  benzene-1,2,4,5-tetrathiolato) and 
{[FeFe](CO)6}2(μ,μ-obtt) (μ,μ-obtt  =  benzene-1,2,3,4-tetrathiolato) were synthe-
sized by the reaction of Fe3(CO)12 with corresponding tetramercaptobenzene 
ligands, respectively (51 and 52 in Figure 7.7). Two teteranuclear Fe–S complexes 
have two [2Fe2S] centers, which are similar to the typical butterfly-shaped [FeFe] 
model. Fe–S complex 51 shows a symmetric structure with two [2Fe2S] centers 
located at the opposite position of the benzene ring. The four S atoms in Fe–S com-
plex 51 are approximately in the plane of the benzene ring, while Fe–S complex 52 
is a position isomer of the complex, showing an eccentric structure with two vici-
nal [2Fe2S] centers fused to a benzene ring. Both of these two teteranuclear Fe–S 
complexes show four-electron transfer relays via two consecutive reversible two-
electron reduction events. Hexanuclear and octaunclear Fe–S complexes have also 
been reported by Sun and Hu groups, which are linked to three or four [2Fe2S] 
centers 
by 
benzeneperthiolato 
and 
5,10,15,20-teteraphenylporphyrinozinc  
[102, 103]. Octamethylsilsesquioxanes (POSS) have alternating Si−O bonds to 
form cage structures with Si atoms in the vertices, which are exceptional building 
blocks to support [2Fe2S] clusters [104]. Sierra and coworkers reported two POSS-
supported polynuclear Fe–S complexes containing eight [(μ-SCH2)2NR][FeFe]
(CO)6 (R = alkyne) (53 and 54 in Figure 7.7) through click reaction. The POSS-
supported polynuclear Fe–S complexes 53 and 54 are soluble in organic solvents 
and can be characterized by spectroscopic techniques. The Fe–S complex 53 and 
54 well reproduced the properties of [FeFe]-hydrogenases.
7.3.2  The Assembly of Fe–S Clusters to Form CPs
The incorporation of Fe–S clusters into a larger framework is a very promising 
way to increase their long-term stability, mimicking the catalytic sites in natural 
enzymes. Anderson and coworkers prepared two CPs containing infinite chains of 
[4Fe4S] cluster which were connected by 1,4-benzenedithiolate (bdtH2) and sur-
rounded by tetra-n-butylammonium (TBA) or tetramethylammonium (TMA) 
(Figure 7.8a) [105]. The [4Fe4S]-BDT chains were separated by TBA cations due to 
the steric hindrance, whereas the smaller TMA cations allowed closer contact

between the [4Fe4S]-BDT chains. Interestingly, adding Li ions in the synthesis 
process of the [4Fe4S]-based CPs could slow the precipitation rate, thus improving 
their crystallinity. Furthermore, isolated crystalline [4Fe4S]-BDT-TMA CP is

soluble in DMF confirmed by the results of small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). 
While adding [TBA][PF6] to the solution could result in the production of [4Fe4S]-
BDT-TBA CP with low crystallization. These results indicate that the choice of 
counterion plays an important role in modulating the morphology, solubility,  
and crystallization of [4Fe4S]-based CPs. Later on, the same groups investigated 
the steric and electronic effects of ligand substitution on [4Fe4S]-based CPs by 
using methylated BDT ligands (2,5-dimethyl-1,4-­benzenedithiol [DMBDT] or 
2,3,5,6-tetramethyl-1,4-benzenedithiol [TMBDT]) [107]. They have found that 
methylation can increase the electron density in the series; however, TMBDT 
shows unexpected properties due to steric constraints. More recently, Ma and 
coworkers reported the first examples of [2Fe2S]-based CPs {[Fe2S2-Ag1](4-cpmt)2 
(CO)6(ClO4
−)}n (4-cpmt = (4-cyanophenyl)methanethiolate), {[Fe2S2-Ag2](4-cpmt)2 
(CO)6(OTf−)2(benzene)}n, and {[Fe2S2-Ag2](3-cpmt)2(CO)6(ClO4
−)2}n (3-cpmt  =   
(3-­cyanophenyl)methanethiolate) [108]. These [2Fe2S]-based CPs were prepared 
through the reaction of [FeFe](4-cpmt)2(CO)6 and [FeFe](3-cpmt)2(CO)6 with sil-
ver salts in CH2Cl2/benzene or CH2Cl2/toluene solvents in the dark. Interestingly, 
a novel [Fe2S2-Agx] (x = 1 or 2) photocatalytic sites for H2 production were pro-
duced in all the three [2Fe2S]-based CPs due to the formation of extra Ag−S bonds 
between the Ag+ centers and S atoms of the [2Fe2S] centers.
Kanatzidis and coworker reported that a series of biomimetic chalcogels con-
sisted of redox-active [4Fe4S] clusters and [SnnS2n+2]4− (n = 1, 2, and 4) [109–111]. 
These [4Fe4S]-based chalcogels were prepared by replacing the terminal chloride 
ligands in (Ph4P)2[Fe4S4Cl4] cluster with sulfur atoms from Na4SnnS2n+2 precursors 
from a polymerized network with abundant porous structure. The various 
[SnnS2n+2]4− linking blocks do not significantly alter the local environment around 
the [4Fe4S] clusters. However, it shows a great effect on the redox properties of the 
[4Fe4S] clusters and the electronic interaction between the clusters by the varying 
charge density of the [SnnS2n+2]4− linking blocks. In addition, the same group added

transition metals such as Co2+, Ni2+, Zn2+, Sn2+, and Pt2+ to tune the concentration 
of the [4Fe4S] cluster, which further tailor the photo/electrocatalytic properties of 
[4Fe4S]-based chalcogels through the control of spatial distance of the [4Fe4S] clus-
ters (Figure 7.8b) [106, 112]. Furthermore, the Ru(bpy)2+ PS can be easily incorpo-
rated into the chalcogel due to the overall negatively charged {[Fe4S4]x[SnnS2n+2]y}m−. 
The PS-functionalized chalcogels are suitable for producing hydrogen under 
­photochemical conditions.
7.3.3  The Assembly of Fe–S Clusters Anchored Onto 
Heterogeneous Supports
The use of heterogeneous support for the immobilization of [2Fe2S] clusters via 
their outer coordination sphere are an appealing approach to increase the structural 
stability of all reaction partners. The support such as metal-organic frameworks 
(MOFs), mesoporous molecular sieves (MCM-41), periodic mesoporous organosili-
cas (PMOs), silica nanoparticles, and graphene-based supports with large specific 
surface area and pore volume, well-ordered tailorable pores or channels, electro-
static microenvironments, and hydrophobic cavities, have been used for the incor-
poration of [2Fe2S] clusters and PSs to be applied in photocatalytic H2 production. 
The precise design of these platforms allows the creation of solid heterogeneous 
photocatalytic systems with enhanced stability, easy separation, and efficient recy-
cling for light-induced hydrogen production processes. It improves the stability of 
the [2Fe2S] clusters and allows easy recovery of the catalyst by filtration.
MOFs, also known as porous CPs, are assembled by metal nodes and organic link-
ers to form one-, two-, or three-dimensional extended coordination networks. The 
well-defined pore and crystal structure, favorable biocompatibility, good chemo-/
machinal stability, and the high surface of MOFs endow them as an ideal host 
matrix to develop enzyme@MOF composites [113, 114]. Furthermore, the organic 
linkers with functional groups of MOFs allow for the incorporation of molecular 
catalysts by direct solvothermal synthesis, or through post-synthetic linker exchange, 
or post-synthetic modification  [115]. The first example of a [2Fe2S] cluster 
­immobilized in MOF supports has been reported by Cohen and coworkers in 
2003  [116]. They incorporated a [2Fe2S] cluster ([FeFe](dcbdt)(CO)6, dcbdt  = 
1,4-dicarboxyl­benzene-2,3-dithio-late) into a highly robust Zr(IV)-based UiO-66 
MOF by post-­synthetic linker exchange with a degree of 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate 
ligand exchange of 14%. The UiO-66 support protects the reduced species of the 
[2Fe2S] cluster from nonproductive charge recombination, resulting in higher sta-
bility under photocatalytic conditions. Furthermore, the CO ligands of the confined 
[2Fe2S] cluster in the UiO-66 can be replaced by smaller phosphines (PX3 X = Me, 
Et) to afford [FeFe](dcbdt)(CO)4(PX3)2 clusters in the UiO-66 support [117]. Later 
on, the same group chose a new MOF support MIL-101(Cr)-NH2 with a bigger pore 
size (29–34 Å) than that of UiO-66 (8–11 Å) for increasing the [2Fe2S] catalyst load-
ing [118]. This MIL-101(Cr)-NH2 MOF provided an amino-functionalized group, 
which can covalently link to a [2Fe2S] cluster ([FeFe](cbdt)(CO)6, cbdt  =   
3-carboxybenzene-1,2-dithiolate). In 2014, Feng and coworkers reported the 

7.3  ­Th e Assembl y of F e–S Cluster

incorporation of a [2Fe2S] cluster [FeFe][(í-SCH2)2NC(O)C5H4N](CO)6 into a ther-
mally robust Zr-phorphyrin based MOF (ZrPF), in which the zinc at the center of 
porphyrin provided binding sites for the pendant pyridyl groups (Figure 7.9a) [119]. 
The direct coupling of a [2Fe2S] cluster to a porphyrin PS in the same system could 
enhance the electron transfer process without the help of an electron mediator, afford-
ing high efficiency in photocatalytic H2 production. Very recently, Yuan and cowork-
ers successfully integrated a [2Fe2S] cluster [FeFe](p-alkynylbenzeneazadithiolate) 
(CO)6 into a highly robust photosensitizing UiO-MOF through a facile click reaction 
(Figure 7.9b) [120]. The [Ru(bpy)3]2+-derived dicarboxylate linker in the UiO-MOF 
acts as a PS, whereas an azide-modified dicarboxylate linker provides covalent 
anchor sites for the [2Fe2S] cluster by a click reaction. The excellent photocatalytic 
performance of the UiO-MOF-[2Fe2S] suggests that the integration of a [2Fe2S] cata-
lytic center and a PS into the same MOF support by a covalent bond is a promising 
strategy not only to stabilize the [2Fe2S] cluster but also improve the photocatalytic 
efficiency of H2 production.
OMSs are usually achieved by the self-assembly of silica species and structure-
directing agents, such as amphiphilic surfactants and biomacromolecules [60]. OMSs 
possess large specific surface area, narrow pore size distributions, and tunable pore 
size (2–50 nm), electrostatic microenvironments, high thermal stability, making 
them a promising support for enzyme immobilization. In addition, they also offer the 
ability to stabilize charge-separated states in catalytic processes. In 2014, Li and 
­coworkers used an ordered mesoporous K+-exchanged molecular sieve MCM-41 to 
immobilize a [2Fe2S] cluster [FeFe]-{(μ-SCH2)2N(CH2C6H5)}(CO)5P(Pyr)3 through 
electrostatic interactions [121]. The high surface area of MCM-41 maintains the dis-
persion of the [2Fe2S] cluster and prevents aggregation and precipitation. No leakage 
of the [2Fe2S] cluster was observed after stirring the composite suspension in water 
at room temperature overnight, confirming the tight incorporation of the [2Fe2S] 
cluster in MCM-41. The same group incorporated another [2Fe2S] cluster covalently 
linked with two bis(2-phenylpyridine)(2,2′-bipyridine)iridium(III) chromophores 
(Ps) into MCM-41 through electrostatic interactions (Figure  7.9c)  [122]. This 
PS-[2Fe2S]@MCM-41 composite exhibits improved stability and photocatalytic per-
formance, revealing the advantage of mesoporous molecular sieves as an excellent 
support for [2Fe2S] clusters.
PMOs are a class of organic/inorganic hybrid materials, which are synthesized by 
the combination of a surfactant as a soft template and a hydrolysable bis-silane as 
the organosilica precursor [123]. These materials possess well-ordered mesostruc-
tures with a homogeneous distribution of organic fragments and provide abundant 
functionalities, endowing them as attractive supports for catalysts. In 2018, a [2Fe2S] 
cluster tethered with a maleimide was successfully immobilized on the pore surface 
of a PMO with thiol groups (SH-PMO) to form an efficient photocatalytic H2 pro-
duction catalyst [124, 125]. The maleimide groups of the [2Fe2S] cluster formed 
covalent bonds with the thiol groups of SH-PMO without the destruction of the 
[2Fe2S] cluster and the ordered pore structure of SH-PMO. Furthermore, both 
[Ru(bpy)3]2+ PS and [2Fe2S] cluster can be immobilized on SH-PMO through cova-
lent coupling maleimide with thiol groups to form an all-solid-state photocatalyst.

It evolved into H2 without the additional [Ru(bpy)3]2+ PS, inferring efficient pho-
toinduced electron transfer from the immobilized [Ru(bpy)3]2+ PS to the immobi-
lized [2Fe2S] cluster.
The nanosilica was used as a heterogeneous support by Wang and coworkers to 
anchor [2Fe2S] cluster 12 by modifying the nanosilica with (Ph2PCH2)2N 
groups [126]. This work provided an interesting way to disperse the water-insoluble 
[2Fe2S] clusters in pure water by using modified nanosilica.
Graphene, as a single-atom thick planar sheet of sp2-bonded carbon atom regu-
larly packed in a hexagon network, processes a larger specific surface area, high 
electrical conductivity, mechanical stability, and thermal conductivity  [127]. In 
2017, Dey and workers grafted an azide-terminated amine linker on edge plane 
graphite (EPG) for anchoring [FeFe] hydrogenase catalyst [128]. A [2Fe2S] cluster 
[FeFe]-(p-alkynylbenzeneazadithiolate)(CO)6 can be tethered onto the surface of 
EPG via click reaction (Figure 7.10a). Another functionalized graphene was used 
to stabilize a [4Fe4S] cluster ([PPh4]2[Fe4S4(DMET)4], DMET  =  cis-1,2- 
dicarbomethoxyethylene dithiolate) through H-bonding interactions [130]. GO, a 
derivative of graphene, has plentiful oxygen-containing groups on its surface, which

is favorable for dispersion in water and provides reactive sites for chemical modifi-
cation. Yan and coworkers first prepared a phorphyrin-type PS functionalized GO 
support through an amide bond with an amine-functionalized tetraphenylporphy-
rin (5-4(amino-phenyl)-10,15,20-triphenyl porphyrin, TPP-NH2)  [131]. Then, a 
[2Fe2S] cluster [FeFe](μ-pdt)(CO)5[Fc(PPh2)CHO], which contains an Fc-based 
ligand to simulate the function of the [4Fe4S] cluster, was successfully attached to 
the surface of the TPP-modified GO through covalent bond by Prato reaction [132]. 
The composite can well disperse in water and exhibit higher efficiency of electron 
transfer, which can be ascribed to the outstanding hydrophility and electrical con-
ductivity of GO. Later on, Sarkar and Begum et al. reported the incorporation of a 
[4Fe4S] cluster ({Fe4S4}(mnt)4, mnt  =  maleonitriledithiolate) on the surface of 
functionalized carbon nanotubes (CNTs). The [4Fe4S] cluster can be immobilized 
on a single CNT or entrapped between two CNTs through the adsorption or 
H-bonding interactions between –COOH/–OH groups of CNTs and NC terminals 
of [4Fe4S] clusters. Very recently, Lu and coworkers covalently attached a [2Fe2S] 
cluster [FeFe]{(μ-SCH2)2N(C6H4CH2CH2OH-4)}(CO)6 onto benzoxy-functionalized 
single-walled CNTs through esterification reactions (Figure 7.10b) [129]. Zhao and 
coworkers reported a similar [2Fe2S]-CNTs composite to investigate substituent 
effects of PR3-phosphine ligands of [2Fe2S] cluster on the electrochemical HER 
performance [133]. Three phosphine ligands {P(C6H4R-4)3, R = F, H, and Me} were 
chosen to replace one CO terminal ligand, to form the target monophopshine sub-
stituted [2Fe2S]-CNTs composites, in which the composites with F-substituted 
phosphine exhibits the superior photocatalytic performance of H2 production rela-
tive to its analogs with H- and Me-substituted phosphines. Therefore, the use of 
CNT as heterogeneous support to link the [2Fe2S] cluster through a covalent bond 
could be a viable strategy to improve the photocatalytic performance of H2 produc-
tion over [2Fe2S] clusters.
7.4  ­The Application of [2Fe2S] Clusters in 
Photocatalytic H2 Production
The [2Fe2S] clusters as the catalytic centers in [FeFe]-hydrogenase has been widely 
used in photocatalytic H2 production [108]. Among all the [2Fe2S] clusters, the bdt 
bridged dirron complexes were specially selected as photocatalysts due to their 
reversible reductive electrochemistry and good activity at mild potentials. Gloaguen 
and coworkers reported an inexpensive photocatalytic system consisting of [2Fe2S] 
cluster 37, organic xanthene dyes [Eosin Y (EY2−) or Rose Bengal (RB2−)] as PSs, 
and triethylamine (Et3N) as a sacrificial electron donor (SED) in an aqueous solu-
tion of sodium dodecyl sulfate at basic pH values [134]. [2Fe2S] cluster 37/EY2−/
Et3N system produced up to 0.86 ml of H2 in 4.5 hours with the turnover number 
(TON) of 117 mol of H2 per mol of catalyst. The production of H2 lasted for more 
than 30 hours, revealing the relative stability of [2Fe2S] cluster 37 under photocata-
lytic conditions. However, the H2 production activity of the catalytic systems, based 
on P(OMe)3-substituted [2Fe2S] clusters [FeFe](μ-bdt)(CO)5P(OMe)3] and [FeFe]

203
7.4  The Application of [2Fe2S] Clusters in Photocatalytic H2 Production
(μ-bdt)(CO)4(P(OMe)3)2], significantly decreased due to the similar reduction 
potentials of organic xanthene dyes. Therefore, the H2 production activity of [2Fe2S] 
cluster systems depends directly on the amplitude of the driving force for electron 
transfer from the PSs to [2Fe2S] clusters. [2Fe2S] cluster 37 had also been employed 
in combination with the p-type silicon (Si) photocathode, and HClO4 as a proton 
source to promote photoelectrochemical H2 generation (Figure  7.11a)  [135]. On 
illuminated p-type Si (661 nm), [2Fe2S] cluster 37 exhibited a single reversible two-
electron reduction wave, the potential of which was about 500 mV positive than that 
on the glassy carbon electrode under identical conditions. The light-assisted reduced 
[2Fe2S] cluster 37 was then able to reduce protons from strong acid at the potential 
of the two-electron reduction. This homogenous photoelectrochemical reduction 
system was achieved with 100% Faradaic efficiency for H2 production, a high cur-
rent density of 38 mA cm−2, and 640 mV of open circuit voltage under 661 nm with a 
light conversion efficiency of 8%.
Apart from the organic dyes and semiconductors, the organometallic Ru com-
plexes were commonly employed as a candidate PS to construct the photocatalytic 
H2 production system based on [2Fe2S] clusters  [88, 89]. The photocatalytic  
systems, consisting of [FeFe][(μ-Cl2bdt)(CO)6] (Cl2bdt  =  3,6-dichlorobenzene-
1,2-dithiolate) and naphthalic anhydride bridged [2Fe2S] clusters 43 as catalysts, 
[Ru(bpy)3]2+ as PS, ascorbate for [FeFe][(μ-Cl2bdt)(CO)6], and ethylene diamine

tetraacetic acid (EDTA) for [2Fe2S] cluster 43 as SEDs in aqueous/organic media 
show significantly different photocatalytic performance (Figure 7.11b) [63, 74]. The 
TON was as high as 200 for [FeFe][(μ-Cl2bdt)(CO)6] in 2.5 hours and 1.2 for [2Fe2S] 
cluster 43 in 2 hours. The relatively poor catalytic activity of [2Fe2S] cluster 43 was 
mainly due to the smaller free energy (driving force) of the oxidative quenching of 
the excited [Ru(bpy)3]2+* and the weak proton affinity of the [2Fe2S] cluster 43 to 
form the iron-hydride species.
Interestingly, the PS can be covalently linked to the [2Fe2S] clusters through 
­dithiolate-bridged ligands, which are beneficial for intramolecular electron transfer. 
The distance between the PS and diiron core [FeFe] as well as their relative orienta-
tion could be controlled, which was required for fast electron transfer and for pre-
venting the yielded charge separation state from recombination. Wasielewski and 
coworkers covalently coordinated a Zn porphyrin to a NMI bridged [2Fe2S] clus-
ter [94]. The charge separation (CS) and charge recombination (CR) dynamics of 
[2Fe2S] cluster 55 (Figure 7.12) were monitored by the lifetimes at 616 nm, which 
yielded τCS  = 12 ± 1 ps and τCR  = 3.0 ± 0.2 ns in toluene and τCS  = 24 ± 1 ps and 
τCR = 57 ± 1 ps in CH2Cl2. Photocatalytic H2 production occurred in the presence of 
trifluoroacetic acid in toluene under visible light. However, the CS and CR process 
slowed down to τCS = 67 ± 5 ps and τCR = 146 ± 9 ps CH2Cl2 in the similar [2Fe2S] 
cluster 55 with ZnTPP as the PS [136]. The incorporation of a Fc secondary electron 
donor to the phenyl group of ZnTPP can boost the energy transfer from 1*ZnTPP to 
Fc, which significantly facilitates the electron transfer from 1*ZnTPP to the diiron 
core [FeFe]. The CR of [2Fe2S] cluster 56 (Figure 7.12) occurred in 9 ± 2 ps, and the 
Fc+-ZnTPP-NMI-S2-Fe0FeI(CO)6 species formed in only 13% yield. In contrast, add-
ing a phenyl group between ZnTPP and Fc slows down the energy transfer rate from 
1*ZnTPP to Fc about 20 times, allowing the desired reduction of the diiron core 
[FeFe] to dominate, so that the overall yield of Fc+-Ph-ZnTPP-[NMI-Fe0-FeI-
S2(CO)6] rises to 71% and the CR slows to 67 ns. Therefore, the long-live charge sepa-
ration state was crucial for photocatalytic H2 production. Reek and coworkers 
reported a [2Fe2S] cluster 57 (Figure  7.12) with the coordination of the pyridyl 
nitrogen to the porphyrin Zn center to investigate the photoinduced intramolecular 
electron transfer [137]. The difference in the orientation of PS and the coordination 
of a pyridyl group to the ZnTPP greatly slowed down the CS and CR processes with 
the lifetimes of τCS = 40 ± 3 ps and τCR = 205 ± 14 ps. However, the NMI group was 
noninnocent during the first reduction of [2Fe2S] cluster 57, resulting in a low activ-
ity in photocatalytic H2 production.
However, the stability of [2Fe2S] clusters cannot meet the requirement of the 
photocatalytic conditions in a solution phase. Heterogeneous supports, such as 
supramolecular complexes, and microporous crystalline materials can integrate the 
[2Fe2S] clusters and PSs in one system, which provide an ideal platform to stabilize 
the [2Fe2S] cluster catalysts. Wu and coworkers utilized a common hydrophilic 
polymer poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) as the support for [2Fe2S] clusters through the 
functional carboxy groups [138]. The photocatalytic system with PAA-[2Fe2S] clus-
ter as a catalyst, CdSe QDs as a PS, and ascorbic acid as a proton source and SED 
show exceptional TON (based on the [2Fe2S] subunit) of up to 27 135. In addition, 

205
the PAA moiety-[2Fe2S] cluster not only protects the CdSe QDs from photo-­
corrosion and aggregation but also narrows the distance between [2Fe2S] cluster 
catalysts and CdSe QDs in aqueous solution, which facilitates electron transfer from 
the excited CdSe QDs to [2Fe2S] clusters, and consequently improves the rate of 
photocatalytic H2 production. Ott and coworkers immobilized the [2Fe2S] cluster 
into UiO-66 MOF as a catalyst, showing substantially improved initial rates and 
overall H2 production in water at pH 5 by using [Ru(bpy)]2+ as a PS and ascorbate as 
SED [107]. The improved catalytic performance can be attributed to the structural 
stabilization of [2Fe2S] clusters by the surrounding UiO-66 MOF. In addition, the 
MIL-101 with a larger pore size than UiO-66 shows an increased loading amount of 
[2Fe2S] clusters [118]. The amount of produced H2 is proportional to the [2Fe2S]

through MOF supports is great of importance in the development of improved

7.5  ­Conclusion and Perspective
Fe–S clusters are of great importance in all domains of life, performing a wide range 
of advantages, such as a modular structure, earth-abundant components, and 
diverse functionality under mild conditions. Over the last several decades, biomi-
metic inorganic chemistry has focused on the synthesis of FeS cluster analogs to 
provide new insights to elucidate the relationship between properties and structures 
as well as to expand utility. In this chapter, we have presented a comprehensive 
overview of the modification and assembly methods and their effects on the reduc-
tion potential, stability, water solubility, and photocatalytic activity of Fe–S clusters.
Fe–S clusters can be precisely modified by replacing the CN− or CO ligands with 
phosphine ligands, NHC ligands, or chelated N-based ligands, rendering more nega-
tive reduction potential and increasing the stability of Fe–S clusters under photo-
catalytic conditions. Although aromatic dithiolate-modified Fe–S clusters show 
obviously different structures compared to the natural Fe–S clusters, the aromatic 
dithiolate bridged ligands can shift the reduction potential for proton reduction, 
stabilize the catalytic intermediates, and favor the assembly of Fe–S clusters with 
functional materials for water solubility and photocatalytic activity. Furthermore, 
the attachment of light-harvesting chromophores to the phosphine ligands or the 
aromatic aromatic dithiolate bridged ligands could help in intermolecular electron 
transfer, thus facilitating photocatalytic H2 production. Interestingly, the assembly 
of Fe–S clusters into polynuclear Fe–S complexes and CPs endow Fe–S complexes 
with a multiple-electron transfer process. In addition, the synergistic hybridization 
of Fe–S clusters with heterogeneous supports such as MOFs, MCM-41, PMOs, silica 
nanoparticles, and graphene-based support can modulate the outer coordination 
sphere and develop improved photocatalytic systems for H2 production, harnessing 
inspiration from nature. Since lots of Fe–S cluster analogs have been synthesized, 
the modification or assembly methods we summarized in this chapter provide 
insights for the future development of Fe–S cluster analogs with desired properties.

8.1  ­Introduction
In the past two decades, semiconductor quantum dots (QDs), zero-dimensional 
structures with nanometer-scale size in all three axes, have been among the most 
frequently reported nanomaterials, both from a theoretical perspective and for their 
use as novel materials in a variety of applications [1–4]. The reports of QDs in the 
literature mainly focus on group II–VI (e.g. CdSe, ZnS), group IV–VI (e.g. PbS, PbSe), 
and group IV–V (e.g. InP, InAs), or alloy QDs composed of two or more semiconduc-
tor materials. Although CdSe QDs, the current workhorse among semiconductors, 
have been highly developed, they are limited by the environment and have minimal 
potential for use in industry. As a possibly less toxic alternative for CdSe QDs, InP 
QDs are generating a lot of attention while being made of relatively affordable, envi-
ronmentally friendly, and abundant on-earth materials. By adjusting their size, InP 
QDs, direct-bandgap III–V compound semiconductors with a bulk bandgap of 
1.35 eV, may emit anywhere from the blue (465 nm) to the near-infrared (750 nm) 
spectrum [5–7]. The synthesis of InP QDs, however, is significantly more difficult, 
and research on them lags behind that of their II–VI counterparts [8].
Magic-sized clusters (MSCs), composed of a specific number of atoms that are 
arranged to form highly stable structures with a size <2 nm, are believed to be inter-
mediates in the reaction pathway between monomers and final QDs [9]. Although 
the composition and size of MSCs can be similar to those of ultrasmall nanocrystals, 
two fundamental characteristics separate these nanocrystals into distinct classes: 
the full-width half maximum (FWHM) of the band gap absorption peaks and the 
type of growth (Figure 8.1). While MSCs have extremely narrow FWHMs and quan-
tized growth from one family of MSCs to another (heterogeneous growth), ultras-
mall nanocrystals often have larger FWHMs and continuous growth for a specific 
size (homogeneous growth) [9, 10]. In 2015, Gary and coworkers observed that InP 
QDs were directly synthesized from the InP MSCs through heterogeneous growth, 
indicating that InP MSCs are key intermediates in the synthesis of InP QDs from 
molecular precursors [11].

The research on InP MSCs provides a mechanistic understanding of InP QD for-
mation and opens the door to rational design of high-quality QD synthesis and the 
creation of novel nanostructures (NSs) that are not possible through traditional 
synthesis. Developments in the research of InP MSCs are summarized in this chap-
ter. We classify research into (i) synthesis of InP MSCs and (ii) applications of 
InP MSCs.

8.2.1  The Low Temperature Method
The low temperature could inhibit the growth of the MSCs to overcome the free 
energy barrier to a large one and is, therefore, one of the most important conditions 
to yield MSCs. The first observation of the InP MSC formation was reported by Peng 
et al. in 2009, when the nucleation process of InP QDs was studied. At a given reac-
tion temperature, the InP MSCs were generated by injecting tris(trimethylsilyl)
phosphine (P(TMS)3) into a hot octadecene (ODE) solution containing HHe +  
In(He)3 or HMy + In(Ac)3 (HHe = hexanoic acid, HMy = myristic acid). A simple 
exchange reaction took place to produce InP and Cl-TMS between P(TMS)3 and the 
indium salt. It was identified by the narrow and fixed wavelength at 386 nm of  
the absorption spectra of the formed InP MSCs in a quite broad temperature range 
138–208 °C. As a result, it was given the name “386-InP MSCs,” [12]. The structure 
of such a cluster was first reported by Cossairt and coworkers through single-­crystal 
X-ray diffraction (XRD). The nonstoichiometric nanocrystal core, which has the 
chemical formula [In21P20]3+, consists of fused six-membered rings with all of the 
phosphorus atoms coordinated to four indium atoms in a pseudo-tetrahedral con-
figuration (inset in Figure 8.2a). The covalent nature of the connection in the inor-
ganic core of this cluster may be the most appropriate interpretation. A combination 
of time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) methods and variable-­
temperature UV–vis spectroscopy suggests that the spectral line width is caused by 
numerous discrete electronic transitions that relate to vibrations of the nanocrystal 
lattice. Due to vibronic coupling, 386-InP MSCs have a huge FWHM of 40 nm 
at = 386 nm. The 386-InP MSC solution’s absorbance peak at 386 nm drastically

narrows at 100 K (Figure 8.2a) [13]. As a result of its distinct inorganic structure and 
ligand configuration, it is the most studied InP MSC system. Using different precur-
sors and reaction conditions, Banin and Ning identify additional InP MSC sizes that 
differ from the earlier report of an isolated InP MSC with an absorption peak at 
386 nm [14]. These InP MSCs were synthesized by very reactive Indium acetate and 
P(TMS)3, which are used as precursors in oleylamine (OLA) and ODE solutions. In 
the UV–Vis absorption of aliquots taken at different temperatures and reaction 
times of InP MSCs, a peak is observed at 365 nm at 70 °C. The peak disappears with 
more heating, and at 170 °C, a new absorption characteristic at 395 nm forms. Both 
the 365 and 395 nm characteristics are visible at the intermediate temperature of 
140 °C, demonstrating the co-existence of the two MSCs. Further extension of the 
reaction time at 170 °C results in a persistent peak at 470 nm (Figure 8.2b). A ligand 
exchange experiment proved the robustness of the InP MSCs with absorption at 
365 nm. After successful ligand exchange with TOP, the fluorescence emission was 
blueshifted from 425 to 405 nm. However, the absorption of the InP MSCs remained 
constant, revealing a distinct band gap at 365 nm. Compared to the 386-InP MSC, 
the MSC with a peak at 365 nm is blueshifted because of improved quantum con-
finement, while the MSC with a peak at 395 nm is redshifted, indicating a somewhat 
higher relative size. These differences could be explained by the less bulky In-acetate 
precursor and how it is arranged in the closed MSC structure [14].
Cossairt and coworkers reported that temperatures between 100 and 110 °C are 
optimal for the synthesis of InP clusters. P(TMS)3 is injected into the hot In(O2C14H27)3 
solution, which can be prepared via trimethylindium (InMe3) or indium acetate 
(In(OAc3)). The mixture can be monitored by UV–vis spectroscopy. When there are 
no further changes in the aliquot spectra, the reaction is complete. The reaction can 
also be performed at room temperature, but the rate is slow [15].
8.2.2  The Ligands Method
In the majority of effective synthetic methods for MSCs, stability, inhibition of 
aggregation, and control of MSC size and structure depend on the employment of 
hydrocarbon molecules with coordinating functional groups (e.g. COOH, NH2) as 
surfactant ligands. In the synthesis of InP MSCs, all of the ligands were for cationic 
surface atoms. The ligands on the surface will increase the stability of the MSCs, 
even at high temperatures. Carboxylate ligands have been widely used in the syn-
thesis of 386-InP MSCs, and the carboxylate-terminated MSCs were discovered to 
be efficient single-source precursors (SSPs) for the production of high-quality InP 
QDs. In the first observation of the InP MSC formation reported by Peng and  
coworkers in 2009, carboxylate ligands have been employed with alkyl chains rang-
ing from butanoic acid (C4) to stearic acid (C18) [12]. The activation energy for MSC 
formation increases with the chain length of the acids. When the alkyl chain is long, 
386-InP MSCs form slowly. However, the 386-InP MSCs with short alkyl chains are 
unstable. In a comparison experiment, the 386-InP MSCs with hexanoic acid (C6) 
can withstand heat up to 158 °C, while the 386-InP MSCs with HMy (C14) can with-
stand heat up to 208 °C. This is reflected in the synthesis of many high-quality 

8.2  ­Synthesi s of  In P MSC
221
crystals that use In(Ac)3 and other types of metal acetates as the precursor. Due to 
the hydrocarbon chain’s extreme shortness, long-chain carboxylate acids of various 
concentrations are frequently added as the ligands of the resultant nanocrystals. 
Molecular precursors and monomers with short-length ligands may be unstable in 
organic solvents prior to the creation of 386-InP MSCs, which causes rapid nuclea-
tion. Long alkyl chain ligands on the surface boost the solubility of the 386-InP 
MSCs after their synthesis, helping to sustain the structure even at high tempera-
tures. Later, when producing InP QDs from indium myristate and P(SiMe3)3, 386-
InP MSCs were seen again. This method is widely used in 386-InP MSC’s synthesis. 
386-InP MSCs are nanoparticles (NPs) with high In content. Each indium atom on 
the surface is joined to at least two other indium atoms by bridging carboxylate 
ligands (Figure 8.3a). There are several binding modes for carboxylate ligands to 
nearby indium atoms in 386-InP MSCs: bidentate modes for a single In center, 
bidentate modes with a dative bond to adjacent In center, symmetric bridging 
modes between two In centers, and asymmetric bridging modes between two In 
centers (Figure 8.3b). The 51 phenylacetate ligands in In37P20(O2CCH2Ph)51 have 
been classified as follows: 12 are bidentate, 1 is bidentate + dative, 5 are symmetric 
bridging, and 33 are asymmetric bridging.
In the reactions yielded nanocrystals, the roles of amines were found to be com-
plex, including slowing the growth rate of nanocrystals and narrowing their size dis-
tribution [16], acting as activating agents for indium carboxylates by increasing their 
reactivity at low temperatures [5], preventing the diffusion of metal atoms and ions, 
selected adsorption on different metal crystal facets [17], activation of metal fatty 
acid salts through the formation of amides, the enhancement effect of alkylamine on 
the growth kinetics of nanocrystals [18], participation in chemical reactions as a 
hydrogen/proton donor [19], etc. In the synthesis of MSCs with carboxylic acid, the 
addition of amine has three roles: First, the addition of amine to carboxylic acid at 
different reaction temperatures results in larger sizes of the MSCs than those gener-
ated in reactions without amines. Xie and coworkers demonstrated that without the

presence of amine, InP nanoclusters could be formed with small sizes. However, the 
reaction rate for the reaction enhanced substantially, which promoted a rapid growth 
of the relatively large InP MSCs with the lowest energy excitonic transition (LEET) 
at λ = 450 nm, which appeared at 158 ≤ TR ≤ 208 °C in the mixture of myristic acid 
and octylamine. The experiment results indicate that the addition of amines in this 
temperature range significantly increases the temperature dependence of the forma-
tion rate of the InP MSCs [12]. In another work, Gary and coworkers found that after 
the addition of just one equivalent of benzylamine, the UV–vis absorbance spectra of 
the titration showed a continuous shift in which the absorption maximum at 386 nm 
was lost and a new broad peak at 404 nm gradually grew in until the addition of 
96 equivalents of benzylamine. After adding six equivalents of benzylamine, no fur-
ther shift in the absorbance maximum at 404 nm was seen in the UV–vis spectra [20]. 
Second, the addition of amine will change the reaction order of indium precursors 
and phosphorus precursors. The production rate of InP nanoclusters was found to be 
the second order against the concentration of P(TMS)3 and the third order against 
the concentration of indium precursors when there was a significant excess of amine 
present. Third, to keep the InP MSCs colloidally stable, more indium fatty acid salts 
were added. However, it was not essential to keep an excessive number of indium 
fatty acid salts around if there were a lot of fatty amines around [12]. Cossairt and 
coworkers found that the direct interaction of the amine with the MSCs: The addi-
tion of primary amine destabilizes the cluster by perturbation of the interconnected 
indium carboxylate ligand, allowing for the growth of InP MSCs at lower tempera-
tures. The absorption spectra of purified samples of 386-InP MSCs were found to 
broaden and redshift to 420 nm [11].
Phosphonic acids have been identified as stronger coordinating capping ligands 
than carboxylic acids due to their superior binding strength. InP octadecylphospho-
nate acid (ODPA) MSCs, which show a persistent peak at 397 nm, were synthesized 
by Cossairt and coworkers and denoted as F397-ODPA InP MSCs. They are stable in 
solution at 370 °C for at least three days and in air for 24 hours. In contrast, the InP 
MSCs with myristate (MA) ligands were found to be unstable after 20 hours in air. 
In contrast to the InP MA MSCs, the InP ODPA MSC retains its UV–vis spectrum 
even after being exposed to primary, secondary, or tertiary fatty amines at 370 °C. The 
above experiments demonstrated that the phosphonate ligand set indeed enhanced 
the thermal stability of the resultant InP MSCs. The fact that the MA InP MSCs may 
be employed as precursors for the ODPA InP MSCs is the most persuasive piece of 
evidence supporting the better stability of the ODPA InP MSCs compared to the MA 
InP MSCs. The authors synthesized the InP ODPA MSC via oleic acid-terminated 
MSCs and analyzed the purified InP MSCs with 1H NMR. The results showed a 
virtually complete conversion to a phosphonate ligand set with a phosphonate-to-
carboxylate ratio of roughly 44  :  1 [11]. In the work by Kim and coworkers on  
heterogeneous-atom-incorporated InP MSCs, phosphonate and carboxylate ligands 
are used for F408-InP:Zn MSCs and F393-InP:Zn MSCs. However, there was no car-
boxylate peak at all in the Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra of 
F393-InP:Zn MSCs, in contrast with the strong characteristic peak at 1558 cm−1 
observed in the spectra of F408-InP:Zn MSCs. The alkenyl proton peak decreased

until it was completely absent when the F408-InP:Zn MSCs transformed to F393-
InP:Zn MSCs, which demonstrates the ligand-exchanging process that occurred 
during the transition from F408-InP:Zn MSCs to F393-InP:Zn MSCs. The amount of 
ODPA critically determined the conversion kinetics from F408-InP:Zn MSCs to 
F393-InP:Zn InP MSCs. An increase in the amount of ODPA facilitated faster 
­conversion to F393-InP:Zn MSCs. F393-InP:Zn MSCs showed the narrowest LEET 
and the highest stability, which remained unchanged at 300 °C even after days. 
Thermodynamically, the nature of the conversion may be seen as an increase in 
enthalpy caused by switching from weaker starting ligands to a stronger ODPA 
ligand [21]. In the synthesis of 386-InP MSCs, indium carboxylates are the primary 
source of oxygen contaminants. These acids are incompatible with the precursor 
P(SiMe3)3, and deleterious side reactions have been widely reported. It was sug-
gested that a phosphonate-based ligand set may take the place of the carboxylate 
one. The cost and difficulties of large-scale manufacture have increased because the 
resulting MSCs have been shown to be exceptionally thermally stable (up to 400 °C). 
In addition, fatty acids are frequently added to the reaction mixture to colloidally 
stabilize QDs. They are vulnerable to ketonization processes, which emit H2O at 
high temperatures. Recently, a reaction protocol free from acidic reactants was pre-
sented by Matthews and coworkers. The 386-InP MSCs were observed in the reac-
tion of indium precursor (InX3, X  =  Cl, F, OAc) and an equimolar mixture of 
Ph2PSiMe3/P(SiMe3)3 at 100 °C. Interestingly, after continued heating for 48 hours at 
100 °C, a gradual conversion to 430-InP occurred, and this species proved thermody-
namically persistent as there were no further UV shoulders. This report highlights 
the crucial function of Ph2PSiMe3, which dramatically enhances the excitement 
properties of InP-430 nm. By adjusting the ratio of Ph2PSiMe3 to precursors, it is 
possible to synthesize the reported UV signatures of InP at 365 and 386 nm as well 
as fresh instances at 430, 450, 470, and 490 nm. However, when Ph2PSiMe3 is added 
post-synthetically, the impact is significantly reduced or eliminated [22].
8.2.3  The Doping Method
Modifying the MSCs through the introduction of dopant atoms to obtain emergent 
properties or the crystal structure has attracted intense interest. In 2017, the first 
doped InP MSCs with Cd ions through a cation exchange mechanism were 
reported [23]. In this work, Stein and colleagues converted InP MSCs to Cd3P2 MSCs 
at room temperature, with a 500 : 1 excess of cadmium carboxylate per InP cluster 
being required for complete conversion. The conversion was via a three-phase 
mechanism: In the initial topotactic phase, with a necessary decrease in the overall 
ligand density at the cluster surface, up to 16 surface indium cations are gradually 
and stoichiometrically replaced by cadmium cations, while the core structure of 
In21P20 is maintained. During phase 2, a significant excess of cadmium in solution is 
needed to promote progressive exchange with core indium. This exchange is accom-
panied by a structural relaxation of the zinc blende tetrahedron. Finally, the struc-
tural transformation to a tetragonal lattice occurs during titration with Cd2+ in a 
sudden and perhaps irreversible process, and the ensuing cation exchange is rapid, 

8  Indium Phosphide Magic-Sized Clusters

resulting in the diagnostic optical characteristics of the Cd3P2 MSC (Scheme 8.1). 
Each phase involves surface reorganization or structural reconstruction, which cor-
responds to a stabilization of energy from the distorted InP MSC lattice. In this 
work, InP clusters finally completely transform into Cd3P2 clusters as a result of the 
reaction between the InP cluster and cadmium carboxylate, which causes cation 
exchange to occur [23].
In addition to the cation exchange process, InP MSCs may be modified more gen-
erally by cation doping processes to provide doped clusters with new properties. 
After treatment of In37P20(MA)51 with 4–24 M equivalents of Zn2+ for 72 hours at 
room temperature, Friedfeld and coworkers examined the incorporation of zinc 
ions in InP clusters. With the initial [Zn2+] increase, the amount of zinc in the final 
material increases, eventually reaching up to 1.3 : 1 Zn:In. Following the incorpora-
tion of zinc, there are also visible changes in the core structure. However, gallium-
based cation doping proved more difficult to achieve. Upon adding 24 equivalents of 
Ga(OAc)3 to the cluster, the Ga:In saturates at a ratio of 0.07. These reactive varia-
tions are explained by the chemical hardness, ion radius, and valency of Zn2+ and 
Ga3+. Similar trends are observed in these two parameters (ionic radius and chemi-
cal hardness); Zn2+ (74 pm, 10.88) is more closely matched with In3+ (80 pm, 13) 
compared to Ga3+ (62 pm, 17). In addition, the lack of obligate anion loss and 
vacancy formation eliminates Ga3+ incorporated beyond the surface [24].
Besides the metal ion, the capability of nonmetal ions to be doped in InP MSCs 
has also attracted great interest. Two series of heterogeneous-atom-incorporated 
InP MSCs that have chlorine or zinc atoms were reported by Kwon and coworkers. 
386-InP MSCs were used as the starting material for the conversion in each series of 
InP MSCs. It should be noted that if the monodispersity of the MSCs is not con-
firmed, the MSCs with the same absorption spectrum are denoted as a family of

In the conversion to F399-InP:Cl MSCs form F360-InP:Cl MSCs, excess InCl3 and 
thermal activation were both needed (Figure 8.4b and Scheme 8.2a). Because the 
thermal fragmentation from F360-InP:Cl MSCs must react with InCl3 first, the con-
version to F399-InP:Cl MSCs proceeds through subsequent reassemblies and rear-
rangements. According to energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, the surface of 
F360-InP:Cl MSCs had more MA (myristic ligand) than F399-InP:Cl MSCs. The 
instability of F360-InP:Cl MSCs and their thermal fragmentations that resulted in 
the conversion to F399-InP:Cl MSCs are well explained by the fact that MA binding 
on the surface should be very labile. The exceptional chemical stability of F399-
InP:Cl MSCs can be attributed to their substantially balanced cation-to-anion charge 
ratio. F399-InP:Cl MSCs may be kept at room temperature for months with no dis-
cernible alteration. As shown in Figure 8.4c and Scheme 8.2b, F360-InP:Zn MSCs

could be transformed into F408-InP:Zn MSCs, which could then be transformed 
into F393-InP:Zn MSCs. F360-InP:Zn MSCs were prepared in a solution consisting 
of zinc stearate (Zn(SA)2) and (TMS)3P, with In-ODPA complex consisting of  
In(Ac)3 and ODPA acid at 180 °C. The fate of product was determined by TR and the 
amount of ODPA. When the temperature reached 300 °C, F408-InP:Zn MSCs started 
to emerge. An increase in the amount of ODPA can speed up the transition from 
F408-InP:Zn MSCs to F393-InP:Zn MSCs, as is mentioned in Section 8.2.2. The fin-
ished product F393-InP:Zn MSCs exhibits the maximum stability; it remained 
unchanged at 300 °C even after days (Figure 8.4d and Scheme 8.2b). Compared with 
F408-InP:Zn MSCs and F393-InP:Zn MSCs, there are fewer Zn contained in F360-
InP:Zn MSCs; this difference may help retain the polytwistane structure in F360-
InP:Zn MSCs. Due to the considerable amount of Zn present, F408-InP:Zn MSCs 
and F393-InP:Zn MSCs may have experienced major structural changes, resulting 
in the formation of the InxZnyP alloyed zinc-blende structure. It should be noted 
that all of the MSCs mentioned above could be directly synthesized from molecular 
precursors [21].
Despite doping being an important path to improve properties of InP MSCs, it is 
still a challenge to know the specific influence of different sites or sizes of dopant. 
The combination of experiments and computational study provides a promising ave-
nue for understanding the structure–reactivity relationship between doping and 
properties of InP QDs. Recently, Kulik and coworkers demonstrated an atlas of 
favored locations for a variety of M(II) (i.e., Zn or Cd) and M(III) (i.e., Y, Sc, or Ga) 
dopants in the representative III–V InP MSCs using large-scale electronic structure 
simulations with density functional theory (DFT). The size trends, site favorability, 
and the energetics of surface-dependent dopant and dopant concentrations have 
been studied. The projected energetics for isovalent doping (Y(III), Sc(III), or Ga(III)) 
were more sensitive to the mode of ligand binding on the surface than to the dopant 
type. Due to kinetic diffusion barriers restricting the process, only smaller Ga(III) 
was benefited by interior doping. Single-site surface doping with chelating bidentate 
ligand removal was always favorable for M(II) dopants, and the binding mode of the 
ligand eliminated during the doping reaction was most important in determining 
site-specific relative favorability. A map of surface- and ligand-dependent dopant 
energetics is shown in Figure 8.5. The most favorable sites for M(II) doping are con-
centrated at the top of the pseudo-C2 symmetry axis. Most surface locations can eas-
ily incorporate both Zn and Cd dopants. Compared to Zn(II), more favorable Cd(II) 
doping is calculated for more surface sites, which is consistent with the experimental 
observations of facile Cd(II) doping. Comparing M(II) dopants to Ga(III), it can be 
seen that substantially less of the MSC surface is conducive to Ga(III) doping. The 
favorable surface sites for Ga(III) doping are hidden in thermoneutral and unfavora-
ble surface sites. In contrast to Ga(III), the energetics of Y(III) doping are primarily 
thermoneutral across the surface, with one or two marginally favorable spots. As a 
result, although Y(III) doping is possible, it is more likely to be localized to certain 
MSC sites than M(II) dopants. It explains why some dopants, like Ga(III), have 
proven more challenging to incorporate in the MSC [25].

8.3  ­Growth of InP QDs from InP MSCs
As the most common application of InP MSCs, it is extensively studied to synthesize 
InP QDs from InP MSCs. In this part, three topics will be discussed in detail: (i) the 
synthesis methods from InP MSCs to InP QDs (ii) the influence of the synthesis of 
InP MSCs to InP QDs and (iii) the synthesis mechanism from InP MSCs to InP QDs.
8.3.1  The Synthesis Methods from InP MSCs to InP QDs
In 2015, the heterogeneous growth from the InP MSCs directly to InP QDs without 
intermediate-sized particles by hot-injection method was observed by Gary and co-
workers. In this report, purified InP MSCs were dissolved in 1 ml of squalane.  
A heating mantle was used to heat 2.5 ml of squalane to 400 °C while it was being 
vigorously stirred. Then, the InP MSC solution was rapidly injected into the hot 
squalane. The mixture was dropped into a silicon oil bath at room temperature for 
quick cooling after one minute of development [11]. Park and colleagues compared 
this synthetic approach (hot-injection method) with heat-up method [15]. For heat-
up method, first heat the anhydrous 1-octadecene the reaction flask to 300 °C under 
inert gas while stirring. Second, purified InP clusters are dissolved in anhydrous 
1-octadecene before being injected into the reaction flask. And the reaction was

finished in 20 minutes. The optical spectra of InP QDs synthesized using the two 
methods mentioned above both display the LEET at 564 nm and the corresponding 
photoluminescence (PL) emission peak at 598 nm with a FWHM of 52 nm and trap 
emission evident at redder wavelengths. Although the two synthetic techniques 
(heat-up and hot-injection) produce InP QDs with equivalent optical quality, it is 
important to note that the hot injection approach often results in a sample with 
higher monodispersity because of the quick nucleation at a raised temperature [15]. 
These syntheses of InP QDs from InP MSCs provided a strategy for creating these 
challenging NSs with high quality in terms of size distribution and crystallinity. 
However, it is still a challenge to synthesize relatively large InP QDs with a well-
defined first-exciton absorption peak beyond 600 nm. Secondary injections with 
extra precursors are a popular method to obtain large-size QDs, but they are not 
valid for InP QD formation due to the lack of surface activation reagents. Peng and 
coworkers synthesized high-quality InP QDs with a clearly defined first-exciton 
absorption peak between 480 and 660 nm by secondary injection. Trioctylphosphine 
(TOP) can be regarded as an activation reagent in the synthesis. Nearly monodis-
perse InP QDs with an absorption peak below 550 nm were generated from TOP-
Clusters by the hot-injection approach at first. Then, the different types of InP 
clusters with the same amount of InP units were injected into the presynthesized 
InP QDs. In order to track the process, UV–vis measurements were made on ali-
quots that were taken along the way. According to the temporal evolution of UV–vis 
spectra, well-defined absorption peaks with high-energy absorption shoulders were 
seen when In(TOP)(St)3 was used, indicating a fine size distribution (Figure 8.6) [26].
In addition to the three methods mentioned above, highly luminescent InP/ZnS 
QDs with good optical properties were synthesized from InP MSCs in a few hours 
with no exposure to toxics [27]. The ZnS shell limits excitons, inhibits core oxidation, 
passivates surface imperfections, and dramatically raises the PL quantum yield of 
InP/ZnS core/shell QDs to nearly 40% [5, 28]. The synthesis to form InP/ZnS QD 
cores is as follows: InP QDs were synthesized from InP MSCs through hot-injection 
methods at first, then the InP particles were added to the stock solutions of zinc 
myristate and sulfur and heated to 100 °C. After 10 minutes, the sulfur stock solution 
was added, and the reaction mixture was heated at 220 °C. InP QDs with ZnS shelling

were synthesized after 30 minutes. Replace the stock of zinc myristate and sulfur 
with TOP and selenium, which can synthesize the InP QDs with ZnSe shelling. In 
addition to decorating the shell, the core of the InP QDs can also be modified. A typi-
cal synthesis to form InPZn (25% Zn/In) MSC QD cores is as follows: The InP MSC 
solution was made by dissolving 100 mg of InP MSCs in 2 ml of dry squalene. When 
the temperature surpassed 395 °C, the InP MSC solution was quickly injected into 
the hot zinc stearate solution [29]. Core/shell QDs are significantly more resistant to 
water/oxygen degradation than InP MSCs or even InP QD cores.
Characterizing cluster intermediates during nanocrystal formation is key to 
understanding InP QD development from clusters. However, when QDs are pre-
sent, it is difficult to determine whether clusters exist in condensed phase. An air-
free, one-solvent method was presented by Jensen and coworkers. Benefiting from 
the method, InP QDs could be synthesized in a microfluidic reactor, the resulting 
samples could be purified without precipitation, and the decrease of smaller clus-
ters and the increase of larger QDs could be tracked at the same time. InP clusters 
and QDs are produced under inert conditions using a high-temperature, high-­
pressure microchemical system and purified by gel permeation chromatography 
(GPC) in a glovebox. The purified solution is used to preserve them all together. 
Both clusters and QDs are characterized by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ioniza-
tion time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) at low laser powers. The 
presence and stability of InP clusters are confirmed by MALDI MS during the 
growth of InP QDs. This suggests that InP QDs can form in pure clusters as interme-
diates rather than mixes of clusters and precursors. The use of MALDI MS provides 
new ways for the characterization and mechanistic research of small-sized air-­
sensitive clusters, or QDs.
8.3.2  The Influence on the Synthesis of InP MSCs to InP QDs
Given that QD electronic equipment typically operates at high temperatures, the 
long-term chemical and thermal durability of QDs is essential. Usually, thick silica 
coatings or embedding the QDs in polymers are used to increase stability. However, 
small, glue-free dots for biological imaging and sensing applications cannot be used 
with these strategies. Therefore, studying the influences that affect its stability dur-
ing QD synthesis is crucial for producing large amounts of high-performing QDs. 
Cossairt proposed three features that dictate cluster structure and stability: surface 
chemistry, cation charge, and lattice covalency. First, surface chemistry highly influ-
ences the structure and reactivity of cluster intermediates, as demonstrated in 
Section 8.2.3. Second, due to the larger charge on In compared to Cd, the ligand 
density at metal-rich InP MSC surfaces is much higher than that of comparable 
II-VI clusters, which increases the kinetic stability of these III–V clusters. The third 
feature is the greater covalency of the InP lattice, despite the fact that its bonding is 
still mostly ionic. Researchers also focus on the factors that affect the growth of InP 
MSCs into InP QDs.
Friedfeld and coworkers study the conversion of MSCs to InP QDs as a function 
of temperature, concentration, and additive by situ spectroscopic methods. At a 

8.3  ­Growt h of  InP  QD s fro m I nP MSC
231
temperature of 130–150 °C, InP QDs growth continues for more than 8 hours, and 
significant nonproductive decomposition is observed. At ≥200 °C, the growth of InP 
QDs is complete within 20 minutes. Upon the temperature raised up to 250 and 
300 °C, the finished product has a narrower absorbance characteristic commensu-
rate with decreased polydispersity, which is similar to the hot-injection synthesis of 
InP QDs mentioned above at 400 °C. Having determined the influence on the forma-
tion of temperature of InP QDs, the concentration dependence of the cluster evolu-
tion has been evaluated. The rate of InP QD formation increases as a function of 
initial MSC concentration. Finally, the researchers investigated the impact of 
­exogenous additives at different temperatures. The distribution of InP QDs is sig-
nificantly impacted by the presence of increasing additive (indium myristate) con-
centrations at low temperatures (150 °C), while the growth rate is not much affected. 
However, the additive amounts have a minimal impact on the product distribution 
at higher reaction temperatures (250 °C and higher). In addition, the stability of 
novel monomer species that are responsible for particle development may also be 
aided by carboxylate additions. At lower temperatures, when there is less monomer 
available, the impact is particularly evident, leading to the creation of bigger, more 
polydisperse InP QDs. Because monomer synthesis occurs more quickly at higher 
temperatures, the presence of carboxylate has little effect on the concentration of 
monomers. As a result, the particle size is mostly independent of the amount of 
myristic acid or indium myristate supplied. These findings emphasize how crucial it 
is to take into account the existence of various monomer species as a function of 
reaction circumstances [30]. Since the early 1990s, organophosphines have been 
extensively used in the synthesis of colloidal QDs [31–33]. In 2008, Xie and co­workers 
reported the decisive role of organophosphines in the formation of good-quality 
InAs QDs via InAs MSCs generated from the reaction of indium carboxylates and 
(TMS)3As [34]. In 2019, the key role of TOP was emphasized by Xu and coworkers 
in the formation of InP QDs with high optical quality via InP cluster. Their ultravio-
let visible spectra show a distinct first-exciton absorption peak and a high-energy 
absorption shoulder. To research chemical reactions, this process is divided into 
four steps. TOP is introduced in the first stage, which drastically changes all four 
phases. In the first stage, TOP, which is soluble and reactive at room temperature, 
reacts with indium stearate [In(St)3] to generate a complex that is less sterically 
hindered and contains three monodentate carboxylates and one TOP ligand 
[In(TOP)(St)3]. TOP is confirmed as the coordinating group for indium carboxy-
lates, which makes [In(St)3] highly soluble in nonpolar solvents at ambient tem-
peratures. In the second step, by combining In(TOP)(St)3 with tris(trimethylsilyl)
phosphine [(TMS)3P)] at room temperature, InP clusters with a nearly uniform 
yield and extremely tiny size are formed (20–50 °C). Compared to the TOP-cluster 
created, the non-TOP clusters formed without TOP at the same reaction tempera-
ture with the In(St)3 precursor. However, the absorption spectrum of non-TOP clus-
ters significantly shifts to the red, suggesting their massive size. In the third stage, 
small InP clusters created using the In(TOP)(St)3 precursor allow for the hot-­
injection method to create almost monodisperse InP QDs. In the final stage, the InP 
QDs generated in the third stage continue to grow in the same pot by secondary

injections of InP clusters generated at room temperature using the In(TOP)(St)3 pre-
cursor for effective “self-focusing of size distribution.” This results in high-quality 
InP QDs with an absorption peak that covers the majority of the visible window 
(between 480 and 660 nm). For the reaction with a high concentration of In(TOP)
(St)3, the UV–vis spectra of the final products are sharp, and the size distribution of 
the final products is nearly monodispersed [26]. In 2022, the role of Ph2PSiMe3 in 
InP QD growth has been explored by Gazis and coworkers. InP QDs have been syn-
thesized by hot-injection method at 200 °C in equimolar solution of PPh2SiMe3/
PSiMe3. Repeating the protocol without Ph2PSiMe3 leads to acolloidally unstable 
precipitate [22]. Simply adjusting the ratio of Ph2PSiMe3 to precursors might be 
used to exercise control over the observed UV signatures, which is an advantageous 
characteristic for commercial QD synthesis.
Considering InP QDs’ stability during synthesis is crucial as well. Colloid InP QDs 
grown from InP MSCs have been evaluated by Brown and colleagues for their chem-
ical and thermal resilience toward photoinduced or thermally induced oxidation. As 
shown in Figure 8.7a,b, when the QDs are kept in room light for 28 hours, there is a 
noticeable reduction in the InPZn MSC QD band edge absorption as well as a 
blueshift. Over extended observation intervals, up to 48 hours, the absorption

spectra stabilize and nearly remain constant. InPZn MSC QD maintained in the 
dark exhibits considerably less QD degradation. In the thermal stability test of InP-
based QDs at increased temperature, within one hour of incubation in air-­containing 
QD solutions, the InP-based QDs rapidly degrade. However, a significant increase in 
thermal stability is seen for InP-based QDs in nitrogenated (oxygen-free) QD solu-
tions (Figure 8.7c,d). Thus, the rate of QD oxidation increases with temperature and 
oxygen concentration for InPZnS MSC QDs. It is evident from the aforementioned 
investigations that the stability of InPZnS MSC QDs is enhanced in low-­temperature, 
dark, and oxygen-free conditions [29].
Another method to prevent chemical deterioration of QDs is to grow a higher 
band gap material over the QD, which can also effectively passivate the QD cores to 
maximize their PL. The effect of InP-based QDs with a shell on their UV–vis and 
luminescence characteristics is shown in Figure  8.7e,f. When suspended in air-­
containing solutions at room temperature, InPZn/ZnS QDs produced from MSCs 
dramatically slow down the rate of deterioration. However, some reduction in QD 
absorption is observed. During the first day, a significant drop in PL of roughly 80% 
is noticed, although the UV–vis spectra remain largely unchanged. The poor quality 
of the ZnS shell that forms on the III–V QD cores is responsible for this considerable 
decrease in QD PL [29].
In addition, the uniformity of the core–shell interface also plays a critical role. 
Stein and coworkers found that conventional shelling techniques inadvertently pro-
duce oxidative defects at the core–shell interface, reducing the achievable PL quan-
tum yields, even with conscious care to prevent phosphorus oxidation during InP 
core synthesis. This drives efforts to create shelling syntheses using innocent pre-
cursors in an effort to reduce interfacial defect sites and optimize conditions to stop 
considerable phosphorous diffusion from the QD core [27].
8.3.3  The Synthesis Mechanism from InP MSCs to InP QDs
To create uniform materials with perfect physical characteristics and photophysical 
function, it is imperative to comprehend the mechanisms for the formation of QD 
from MCSs. Two different mechanism types have been used to illustrate the pro-
cesses of QDs growth mediated by MSCs: (i) monomer-driven growth and (ii) clus-
ter assembly. Monomer-driven growth happens when a reservoir of monomers 
reacts with clusters to create bigger nanomaterials, whether those monomers come 
from the cluster dissolution process or are created from separate molecular precur-
sors. When clusters come together to form a bigger nanomaterial without a ­monomer 
reservoir, the process of cluster assembly takes place [35]. However, the underlying 
mechanisms for the process from InP MSC to InP QDs have not been proposed. In 
2015, Gary and coworkers observed heterogeneous growth from the InP MSCs 
directly to InP QDs, without intermediate-sized particles. These findings imply that 
the production of these kinetically persistent MSCs prior to QD formation has com-
promised earlier attempts to regulate nucleation and development by modulating 
precursor reactivity. By using InP MSCs as SSPs for QDs, the creation of MSCs is 

8  Indium Phosphide Magic-Sized Clusters

successfully separated from the ensuing second nucleation event and InP QD devel-
opment. The stepwise expansion from MSCs to QDs occurs via a second nucleation 
event rather than an aggregative growth mechanism, according to the concentration 
dependency of this SSP reaction and the shape uniformity of particles seen by trans-
mission electron microscopy. Figure  8.8 illustrates such a two-step nucleation 
mechanism [11].
Later, Friedfeld and coworkers propose the conversion of InP MSCs to InP QDs 
by in situ spectroscopic methods (Scheme 8.3): The MSC may dissolve at high tem-
peratures into a combination of monomers and/or cluster fragments and In(O2CR)3, 
which might lead to QD nucleation directly (path 2) or by the addition of monomers 
to the residual MSC (path 2). Indium myristate and monomer species must be sepa-
rated from the cluster through a multistep procedure in order for clusters to dissolve 
into monomers. This process is sluggish and ineffective at temperatures of 150 °C or 
lower, which allows monomer breakdown to compete with InP QD crystallization. 
At higher temperatures, the reaction rate is correspondingly quicker, avoiding the 
monomer breakdown pathway and permitting the production of stable and soluble 
monomer species that nucleate to create QDs with high yield (path 3) [30].

8.4  ­Other Applications of InP MSCs
In addition to synthetic QDs, InP MSCs have been employed as precursors in the 
fabrication of InP NSs with various morphologies. Due to their luminescent charac-
teristics, InP MSCs might also be used in illuminating devices. The following will 
elaborate on these two aspects.
8.4.1  The Synthesis of Diverse Morphology in InP Nanostructures
The area of nanomaterial synthesis has rapidly developed since the discovery of 
emergent properties in nanoscale materials, enabling access to a variety of com-
pletely new phases of matter that are not visible in the bulk. MSCs often have the 
capacity to promote the development of kinetically accessible nanomaterial forms. 
As a result, clusters are employed for template nanomaterial synthesis, and their 
special structural characteristics may be used to speed up the creation of novel 
nanoscale phases. By using 386-MSCs as templates, Cossairt and coworkers synthe-
sized InP nanocrystals of a new crystal phase induced by P(SiMe3)3 at temperatures 
ranging between 35 and 100 °C [36]. The growth of nanocrystals was mediated by a 
partial dissolution and recrystallization pathway. The InP NCs generated form this 
templated growth with a crystal structure that is not zincblende or wurtzite, but 
rather is formed from the initial cluster. By kinetically trapping the phase of the 
cluster, this method makes it possible to synthesize InP NCs with a new three-
dimensional polytwistane framework. And a complete mechanistic scheme was 
proposed: when P(SiMe3)3 reacts with the stabilizing carboxylate ligands of the InP 
MSCs, silylester is formed, and InP monomers are released. This causes a surface 
breakdown event. The cluster does not completely disintegrate, thus its core-­
dominated optical qualities are substantially unaffected, and the crystalline phase 
naturally does not change either. Due to their extremely high chemical potential at 
low temperatures, the fragmented, P-rich products and freed monomers then recrys-
tallize in a non-thermodynamic phase. The resultant NCs adopt the 3D polytwis-
tane shape since they were modeled by the InP cluster’s early phase.
The 386-MSCs were also used as a precursor by Kim and coworkers to produce 
InP NPs or NSs by the heat-up syntheses [37]. Highly anisotropic InP structures 
such as nanorods, pods, hyper-branched NSs, dendrimer-like NSs, and branched 
nanostructures (BNSs) were generated in the absence of a structure-directing agent. 
Firstly, 386-MSCs were synthesized from the reaction of (TMS)3P and In(My)3 com-
plexes, which consisted of In(Ac)3, HMy, and ODE. Fragments of the 386-MSC pro-
vide the monomers needed for InP NPs at 240 °C. A direct attachment of pieces from 
386-MSCs may be the source of the faceted shape of InP NPs. For the next experi-
ment, more InP NPs were yielded from purified 386-MSCs, leading to a burst in 
monomers. In the evolution and fragmentation of the MSCs, In(My)3 improves the 
stability of 386-MSCs. Due to the fact that adding an extra 56 equivalents of In(My)3 
resulted in significantly large InP NPs with a wide size distribution. The shape was 
quite asymmetrical, and several of the particles that may have been produced by the 

8  Indium Phosphide Magic-Sized Clusters

rapid attachment of pieces displayed bifurcation and branching. On the contrary, 
In(My)3 actually promoted the fragmentation of 386-MSCs, which began to disinte-
grate with the additional HMy at as low as 110 °C. Bimodal morphologies were 
observed in the co-existence of In(My)3 and HMy: large BNSs and spherical NPs. 
Researchers also investigate the evolution from MSCs to BNSs (Scheme  8.4).  
~2 nm-sized spherical NPs with amorphous crystal structures started to form when 
MSCs broke down into fragments and monomers. Then, tetrahedral seeds appeared 
and developed into BNSs. The ~2 nm spherical NPs are thought to be formed via the 
assembly of fragments from 386-MSCs. Meanwhile, the 386-MSCs and the dissolu-
tion of fragments generated monomers, which accumulated and produced the 
nucleation sites for tetrahedral seeds quickly. The seeds began to branch and grow 
through the attachment of the ~2 nm NPs to the reactive facets. Finally, the InP 
BNSs with a zinc blende structure were produced. The 386-MSCs at the beginning 
displayed a polytwistane crystal phase. Among the structure transformations from 
MSCs to a more stable crystal, the amorphous ~2 nm NPs are intermediates. In this 
synthesis, highly anisotropic InP structures were generated without any structure-
directing agent.
8.4.2  Developing the Luminescent Property of InP MSCs
Based on the quantum confinement phenomenon, semiconductor nanocrystals  
(SC NCs) display significantly size-dependent optical and electrical features. A lot 
of work has gone into proving their use in screens, light-emitting devices, photoca-
talysis, and so on.
Clearly distinct optical properties exist between MSCs and general QDs. Banin 
and Ning synthesized the growth of a ZnS and ZnSe shell on InP MSCs and investi-
gated the absorption spectra and fluorescence emission of these magic-size III–V SC 
NCs. In order to create 365-InP MSCs, indium acetate and (TMS)3P were employed 
as precursors in solutions of OLA and ODE. The adsorption peak at 365 nm broad-
ened as the first ZnS layer was formed, but the fluorescence remained weak. From 
the growth of first to fifth ZnS layer, the adsorption peak redshifted to ~409 nm. For 
fluorescence emission, after the growth of the third layer, it has increased signifi-
cantly at 460 nm. The emission continues to increase and slightly redshifts as fourth 
and fifth layers are grown, with a peak position at 480 nm and a fluorescence

quantum yield of 4%. At 20 layers, two emission peaks were observed at 480 and 
560 nm. It shows the limitations on the quantum yield of InP MSCs with ZnS shell. 
It should be noted that the surface of the InP MSCs with 5 and 20 layers of ZnS 
includes oleic acid and TOP ligands. The emission peak at 560 nm was assigned to 
interfacial traps. Compared with the InP/ZnS MSCs, a ZnSe shell on InP MSCs with 
absorption at 365 nm also grew. For the InP MSCs with five layers of ZnSe shell, the 
absorption spectra significantly redshifted to ~445 nm, and the fluorescence emis-
sion at 610 nm arose from defect trap states, indicating no improvement was pro-
vided by ZnSe shell for fluorescence emission [14].
8.5  ­Conclusion and Perspectives
With similar optical properties to CdSe nanocrystals, InP nanocrystals have emerged 
as an attractive alternative due to their composition of relatively cheap, sustainable, 
and earth-abundant elements. InP MSCs, which contain tens to a couple of hundred 
atoms, represent the molecular limit of InP nanocrystals. In this chapter, we describe 
in detail different synthesis methods of InP MSCs, as well as their application in 
QDs, diverse morphology NSs, and luminescent devices. In the synthesis process, 
stable InP MSCs can be generated at low temperature or by introducing strongly 
bound ligands such as phosphonic acid. Adding a passivant (e.g. amine, carboxylate, 
phosphonate) or introducing a dopant atom (e.g. Zn, Cl) can produce InP MSCs 
with different properties.
The use of InP MSCs as intermediates to NSs and bulk phases is a field in its initial 
stages with a promising prospect. The research areas that we believe are most likely 
to improve the research of InP MSCs are listed below:
1)	 	High-quality InP MSCs with narrow size distribution and thermal stability can 
now be prepared by rational selection of precursor agents. (TMS)3P is one of the 
most commonly used precursors in synthesis of InP MSCs. However, due to its 
high toxicity, flammability, and explosive nature, its application for industrial-
scale production of InP MSCs is very problematic. Furthermore, the high price 
greatly increases the cost of raw materials for synthesis. Therefore, it is very 
important to develop phosphorus precursors that are cheap, harmless, low-­
toxicity and more environmentally safe.
2)	 	Introducing dopants into InP MSCs has attracted intense experimental and com-
putational interest as a useful means of tuning photoluminescent properties. 
However, the limited studies confined our cognization on the dopant type and 
dopant concentration. Shell-doping, which involves introducing the dopant ions 
into the shell material and provides extra degrees of freedom based on known 
techniques for doping ZnSe and ZnS, is a further idea that has not yet been 
investigated.
3)	 The most popular technique for identifying InP MSCs after synthesis is to con-
firm distinguishing characteristics in absorption spectra. The detailed in situ 
(e.g. UV–vis absorption) and ex situ (e.g. liquid phase and solid-state NMR, XPS, 

8  Indium Phosphide Magic-Sized Clusters

electron microscopy) studies play a crucial role in the design of effective synthe-
sis methods because they give the necessary understanding of the kinetics of 
precursor conversion, potential side reactions, internal structure, and surface 
state of the obtained InP MSCs. However, despite the soft ionization method 
used to evaporate InP MSC, it can often be broken, and broad mass peaks can 
appear. In addition, issues with sample degradation from electron beam irradia-
tion and the restricted resolution of small-sized MSCs remain challenges. The 
development of more advanced characterization methods is important to pro-
mote the synthesis and application of InP MSCs.

9.1  ­Introduction
A renewed interest in atomically precise metal nanoclusters (NCs), including plati-
num and palladium, has recently appeared because of their relevance to nanochem-
istry and nanoscience [1, 2]. The electronic configuration and discrete energy levels 
of noble-metal NCs endow their molecule-like energy transitions to manifest some 
remarkable optical properties and catalytic performance. Thus, when the nuclearity 
of metal clusters increases, and the dimensions of metal nanoparticles reduce, these 
two worlds begin to overlap. More importantly, at the subnanometer scale (0.5–2 nm) 
of molecular-level metal NCs, there is no direct relationship between the size of the 
nanocluster and their catalytic activity, which no longer relies on the cluster size but 
rather on the geometric structure and/or surface ligands [3–5]. The synthesis and 
application of metal clusters remain a hot research area, especially some platinum- 
and palladium-based NCs with a specific number of metal atoms and atomically 
precise structures. For the case of Pt/Pd NCs, truly exponential growth has been 
shown over the past few decades, which is owed in part to the improvements in the 
synthesizing of Pt/Pd NCs, and the advancement of theoretical calculation in 
molecular structure simulations. However, compared with coinage-metal NCs (Cu/
Ag/Au) decorated with various surface organic ligands, the surface modification 
diversity of Pt/Pd NCs is far from satisfactory. Most of the carbonyl coverage is usu-
ally present, especially in high nuclear ligand-stabilized Pt/Pd clusters. For exam-
ple, the platinum carbonyl Chini clusters of [Pt3n(CO)6n]2–, based on triangular 
[Pt3(μ-CO)3(CO)3] units stacked along a common C3 axis, are the milestone in clus-
ter chemistry. Although a large number of derived cluster structures based on this 
primary structure have been reported, the types of displaceable ligands are still lim-
ited. Diverse surface modification will produce rich cluster structures, which can 
motivate more in-depth research to seek valuable insights into the Pt/Pd NCs that 
bridge the gap between atomic (molecular chemistry) and nanochemistry. So, in 
this chapter, we mainly introduce and prospect the synthesis and modification of 
Pt/Pd NCs and discuss some representative examples of these topics.

9.2  ­Synthesis of Platinum and Palladium Clusters
9.2.1  Synthesis of Pt/Pd Carbonyl Clusters (PCCs)
Actually, ultrasmall metal nanoparticles are nothing but mixtures of more or less 
polydisperse large molecular clusters. The chemistry of ultrasmall Pt/Pd nanoparti-
cles (<3 nm) overlaps with that of ligand-protected molecular Pt/Pd clusters. 
Therefore, experimental techniques and methods developed over the years for the 
preparation of large molecular Pt/Pd clusters may play a major role in better under-
standing ultrasmall nanoparticles and Pt/Pd nanoparticles. Within the last category, 
the molecular metal carbonyl clusters (MCCs) represent one of the most widely 
studied classes of metal clusters. The molecular Pt/Pd carbonyl clusters (PCCs) are 
atomically monodispersed, ligand-stabilized Pt/Pd nanoparticles with nanometric 
dimensions [6].
The synthesis of PCCs is briefly described in this section, and aims at showing 
some general guidelines to follow for inducing the preparation of PCCs, which is far 
from being comprehensive. Metal carbonyl clusters display a rich variety of struc-
tures and even species with very similar compositions can adopt rather different 
geometries, in which the M–M interactions are not very strong and are nondirec-
tional [7]. Moreover, only supposedly minor changes in the reagents or in the exper-
imental conditions can result in completely different products [8]. So, it is not yet 
possible to design a priori preparation of a cluster with a predefined structure. 
Nonetheless, this part can outline some general guidelines to follow in order to 
induce the growth of Pt/Pd carbonyl clusters.
The yields of preparing PCCs vary from case to case, but several metal clusters 
have been obtained in the scale of hundreds of milligrams or even grams. 
Experimental conditions must be carefully chosen in order to selectively obtain a 
single species as a major product. IR, MS, and HPLC monitoring of the reactions 
were revealed to be very useful for seeking the best operative conditions. Purification 
for PCCs is usually based on their solubility in water and organic solvents, since 
most of them are anionic, and the solubility of products can be further distinguished 
by the use of appropriate tetraalkylammonium or phosphonium cations. The pos-
sible methods for the preparation of Pt/Pd carbonyl clusters can be classified as fol-
lows: (i) direct carbonylation methods; (ii) redox-induced methods; and (iii) 
chemically/physically induced methods.
9.2.1.1  Direct Carbonylation Method
This method is the main entry for synthesizing metal carbonyl clusters. Homoleptic 
anionic platinum carbonyl clusters of the type [Pt3n(CO)6n]2– (n  = 1–10), usually 
known as “Chini clusters,” possess an original and fascinating oligomeric structure 
composed of stacks of Pt3(CO)3(μ-CO)3 units arranged in a trigonal prismatic fashion 
along a pseudo-C3 axis (Figure 9.1a) [9, 12]. By employing methanol as solvent and a 
weak base (such as CH3COONa), Na2PtCl6 precursor can be quantitatively converted 
into the insoluble “platinum carbonyl” complex with a formula of Na2[Pt3n(CO)6n]. 
By increasing the amount or the strength of the added base, it is possible to obtain 

9.2  ­Synthesis  of Platinum  and  Palladi um  Cluster
243
more reduced platinum carbony clusters that correspond to lower n values. The 
monomeric species [Pt3(CO)6]2– can be obtained upon reduction of larger oligomers 
with Na/K [13, 14]. It represents the most reduced chini cluster that is easy to oxi-
date, thus it is very air-sensitive and has only been spectroscopically characterized. 
The platinum carbonyl clusters can also be synthesized directly in water by room 
temperature carbonylation of [PtCl6]2– (Figure 9.1b) [10].
Longoni et al. reported the procedures that represent significant improvements in 
terms of simplicity and high yields for the platinum carbonyl clusters. The water-
insoluble [Pt3n(CO)6n]2– (n > 6) mixture of oligomers and the [Pt38(CO)44]2– cluster 
are available through simple one-step syntheses from commercial reagents with dif-
ferent CO pressures, respectively. That could hopefully prompt the isolation and 
characterization of the discrete [Pt3n(CO)6n]2– oligomers or new [Pt38(CO)44]2– clus-
ter, as well as the major consideration in nanoscience of these structurally and com-
positionally well-defined Pt clusters. Apart from solutions, this direct carbonylation 
method can also be used in the solid state after the impregnation of a suitable metal 
salt on supports such as metal oxides or zeolites [15, 16]. In particular, Ichikawa and 
coworkers developed the so-called “ship-in-a-bottle” technique which has the ben-
efit of selective formation of Pt carbonyl clusters in micro- and mesoporous materi-
als (Figure 9.1c) [11].
For Pd carbonyl clusters, the initial synthetic route usually involves the reduction 
of palladium salts, either with CO or with other reductants in the presence of 
CO. Unlike Pt carbonyl clusters, Pd does not form discrete stable homoleptic car-
bonyl complexes in solution, so additional donor ligands such as phosphines

are required. A general method was developed that used Pd(OAc)2 as the precursor 
and CO in a dual role of reductant/ligand, together with controlled amounts of 
phosphine in aqueous-organic solvents under adjusted acidity, which is applicable 
for a variety of PR3 ligands (R  =  Alk  =  C2H5, n-C4H9, n-C8H17, n-C12H25; 
R = Ar = C6H5, C6H4-p-CH3, and C6H4-p-OCH3). Although these procedures appear 
to be simple, the preparation of individual compounds often requires strict control 
of reaction conditions. The compounds obtained in this way are normally of low-to-
middle nuclearity (3 ≤ n ≤ 10), which can further serve as precursors for preparing 
for the high-nuclearity clusters. The direct carbonylation for palladium precursor in 
the presence of phosphine ligands has been extensively employed by Dahl and 
Mednikov for the preparation of phosphine-substituted Pd carbonyl clusters 
Pdn(CO)x(PR3)y [17]. These neutral Pdn(CO)x(PR3)y clusters and their heterometallic 
derivatives are particularly remarkable in terms of their exceptional range in metal 
nuclearity (n = 3–165) and the unusual diversity of their structural types.
Investigations of the reactivity of the Pd10(CO)12L6 clusters have given rise to a 
wide variety of nano-sized clusters of Pdn (n = 12–145). The relatively low cohesive 
energy of Pd (377 kJ mol−1), and the relatively weak coordination of CO and PR3 
ligands to Pd(0) (in contrast to that of Pt (0)) greatly facilitate cluster growth. 
Mednikov et al. present the results and stereochemical/bonding implications of a 
systematic investigation of different preparative routes in reactions of three struc-
turally analogous Pd10(CO)12(PR3)6 clusters containing PEt3, PBun
3, and PMe2Ph 
that afforded three (20 CO)-ligated Pd23(CO)20(PR3)10 clusters with R3 = Et3, Bun
3, 
Me2Ph, and the (21 CO)-ligated triethylphosphine Pd23(CO)21(PEt3)10 [18]. This Pd 
cluster growth is affected by a number of factors, if not all possible ones, such as the 
composition of the precursor, the type and concentration of the deligation reagent, 
the duration of the reaction, the dynamics in the removal of liberating CO, the tem-
perature, and the solvent (Figure 9.2a).
9.2.1.2  Redox-Induced Methods
All kinds of redox reactions can be used for the preparation of metal carbonyl clus-
ters. It must be remarked that the Pt/Pd ions in some PCCs are multivalent, which 
means that they may undergo reversible redox reactions without any major struc-
tural rearrangement. The stoichiometric addition of a reducing or oxidizing agent 
can just result in the formation of an isostructural cluster with increased or 
decreased negative charge. More commonly, the reduction of PCCs often results in 
cleavage of M−M bonds or CO loss as a consequence of electrons added to an anti-
bonding orbital. For example, the reduction of Chini clusters [Pt3n(CO)6n]2– affords 
the analogous species that have a lower n value than the previous ones, which are 
obtained by the breaking of Pt−Pt bonds [13, 19]. Oxidation of Pt carbonyl clusters 
with noncoordinating reagents, such as tetrafluoroborate or ferricenium ions, can 
result in the formation of new M−M bonds, as in the dimerization of [Pt24(CO)30]n 
to [Pt38(CO)44]n  [20]. The [Pt3n(CO)6n]2– (n  =  1–10) clusters can be easily inter- 
converted by means of redox reactions under CO atmosphere (Figure 9.2b).
Redox condensation is probably the most useful procedure for the preparation of 
higher-nuclearity metal carbonyl clusters. It consists of the reaction between a 

9.2  ­Synthesis  of Platinum  and  Palladi um  Cluster
245
reduced metal carbonyl anion and a more oxidized species. The latter can be another 
carbonyl species, metal salt, or complex. In this way, homometallic, bimetallic, and 
heteronuclear PPCs can be prepared. Bimetallic Ni–Pt [21], Au–Pd [22, 23], Ni–
Pd [24], Pt–Pd [25], and so on can be easily prepared by starting from reduced car-
bonyls of either metals or salts of the second element (Figure 9.2c).
9.2.1.3  Chemically/Physically Induced Methods
Once PCCs form, they can be modified in several ways, and therefore be used for the 
preparation of new species. The simplest physical treatment for the preparation of 
new metal carbonyl clusters is based on partial decarbonylation of the carbonyl 
clusters precursor after heating, followed by condensation of the resulting unsatu-
rated species with the formation of new M−M bonds. In a few cases, the removal of 
CO ligands from the precursor results only in an intramolecular rearrangement of 
the cluster cage without the structural change. Additionally, the main drawback of 
thermal treatment methods is their relatively poor selectivity. Nonetheless, the ani-
onic selectivity enhancement via the careful monitoring for hydroxide during the 
thermolysis can be nearly as quantitative as in the preparation of [Pt19(CO)22]4– and 
[Pt15(CO)19]4– by heating the appropriate mixtures of Pt Chini clusters  [26]. 
Especially, the globular platinum carbonyl clusters with relatively poor CO coverage 
(CO/Pt = 1.0–1.3) are usually obtained by the heat treatment. The materials pre-
pared by the thermal treatment of Pt Chini clusters are strongly related to the nucle-
arity, counterion of precursors, and reactive conditions such as solvent and 
temperature. As the nuclearity of the precursor cluster increases, the selectivity usu-
ally becomes worse [27].
Moreover, the platinum Chini clusters have been employed for the synthesis of 
globular platinum NCs and bimetallic clusters. Apart from the use of acids, bases,

oxidants, and reducing agents, both anionic (OH–, I–) and neutral (PR3, CO, amines) 
nucleophiles can be employed. They can result in addition to the cluster, its degra-
dation, or even condensation to yield larger species. Garland et al. reported for the 
first time that the species [Pt3(CO)6]n
2− (n = 2) can be formed from the reduction of 
[Pt3(CO)6]n
2− (n = 3–5) by hydrogen alone in acetonitrile. In addition, the detection 
of dissolved CO2 in solution suggests that a room-temperature water gas shift reac-
tion occurs. This has been shown to arise from the nucleophilic attack of water on a 
coordinated CO of [Pt3(CO)6]n
2−, which leads to the formation of [HPt15(CO)19]3− 
and [H2Pt15(CO)19]2−. The [Pt15(CO)19]4− has also been isolated in high yields by 
reaction of [Pt3(CO)6]n
2− (n = 2, 3) with NaOH at 60 °C [28].
The [Pdn(CO)x(PR3)y] clusters, based on phosphine ligands are an important 
Pd-cluster family, especially the [Pdn(CO)x(Pet3)y] series that have been prepared 
with the same phosphine ligand Pet3, which is sterically negligible and also a good 
donor. Up to now, all of the higher nuclear [Pdn(CO)x(Pet3)y] clusters may be 
obtained from reactions with the same tetracapped octahedral Pd10(CO)12(Pet3)6 
precursor via different kinetically controlled synthetic routes to give relatively ther-
modynamically stable Pd cluster products. Dahl and his coworkers have success-
fully synthesized two novel palladium carbonyl phosphine clusters, Pd52(CO)36(Pet3)14 
and Pd66(CO)45(Pet3)16, both of which are obtained from the Pd10(CO)12(Pet3)6 pre-
cursor, via the reaction with different Pd complex (the former is Pd2(dba)3, 
dba = dibenzylideneacetone; the latter is Pd(MeCN)4(BF4)2). The structures of the 
Pd52 cluster and the Pd66 cluster are both arranged on a similar Pd38 interior kernel 
that contains 6 square Pd4 faces and 8 centered Pd7 faces and has 6 interior Pd atoms 
located at the vertices of an octahedron. In the Pd52 cluster, the remaining 14 Pd 
atoms cap on the opposite of the Pd38 kernel as two monocapped Pd7 triangles 
respectively. For the Pd66 cluster, the same monocapped Pd7 triangles are sequen-
tially linked to the four non-adjacent centered hexagonal faces of the Pd38 kernel. 
The probability of the second Pd7 triangle condensing on one of the tetrahedrally 
oriented central hexagons of the Pd38 kernel is three times that on the opposite face, 
indicating that the formal construction of the Pd66 cluster is significantly favored 
over that of the Pd52 cluster (Figure 9.3a) [29].
Dahl et al. have reported the synthesis and structural determination of a novel 
icosahedral-based Pd69 cluster Pd69(CO)36(PEt3)18, which is obtained by heating the 
DMF solution containing Me3NO·2H2O, NaOH, and the tetracapped octahedral 
Pd10(CO)12(PEt3)6 precursor. The large Pd69 core was composed of a central Pd33 trii-
cosahedron, and the responding central icosahedron was completely enclosed by a 
hexagonal-shaped Pd30 cylindrical cavity along with six additional Pd atoms. The 
hexagonal-shaped Pd30 tube was formed by cyclic trans-edge-sharing of six Pd7-
centered hexagons [31]. The larger Pd carbonyl phosphine cluster (Pd145) was also 
reported by Dahl and his coworkers. The preparation of Pd145 is very sensitive to  
the reaction conditions. Great efforts have been made to obtain a successful but  
still low-yield route, which is obtained by the reduction of a mixture of Pd(PEt3)2Cl2 
and Au(PPh3)Cl with CO in the presence of NaOH. In the Pd145 cluster,  
the center Pd atom is surrounded by the 12 Pd atoms, which are further  
encapsulated by 42 Pd atoms, which in turn are surrounded by the 60 Pd atoms.  

9.2  ­Synthesis  of Platinum  and  Palladi um  Cluster
247
In addition, 30 Pd atoms cap the 30 square polygons of the 3rd shell with a PPh3 
ligand linked to every capping Pd atom [32].
In 2007, Lawrence F. Dahl’s research group reported the successor of Pd145 cluster; 
they had prepared the remarkable Pt-centered four-shell 165-atom Pd-Pt cluster, 
(μ12-Pt)Pd164−xPtx(CO)72(PPh3)20 (x ≈ 7), from the reaction of Pd10(CO)12(PPh3)6, 
with Pt(CO)2(PPh3)2. The M165 core consists of four shells from the inside out, a 
central Pt atom is surrounded by four concentric shells containing 12 metal atoms 
in shell 1. Shell 2, 3, and 4 are composed of 42 atoms, 60 atoms, and 50 atoms, 
respectively. The closely similar interior 55-atom geometries of the composite cen-
tral atom, including shell 1 (12 atoms) and shell 2 (42 atoms), in the Pd145 cluster, 
and 165 atoms Pd–Pt cluster, represent the well-known centered two-shell icosahe-
dral Mackay structural model (Figure 9.3) [30]. The synthesis of the previous two-
shell 55-metal-atom clusters is very difficult due to their extreme air-sensitivity. 
These clusters have not been able to obtain high-quality crystals limited by the syn-
thesis challenge, so they were characterized indirectly by spectroscopic methods, 
elemental analyses, and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. 
Recently, Dahl et al. have successfully successfully the interior two-shell Mackay 
55-metal-atom icosahedron and given its crystallographic characterization of 
Pd55(PPri
3)12(μ3-CO)20. Especially, this Pd55 cluster has much greater stabilization 
than the previous 55-metal-atom M55L12Clx clusters [33].
9.2.2  Synthesis of Pt/Pd-Clusters Protected by Organic Ligands
The [Pt3n(CO)6n]2– (n = 2–6) can be used as a precursor to prepare other ligand-
protected clusters via the non-redox substitution. For instance, the sterical substitu-
tion of PPh3 ligand occurs only at the external triangular Pt3–CO units, and so, a 
maximum of two PPh3 ligands may be introduced in one cluster, which recently

extended to other monodentate and bidentate phosphine ligands. During the non-
redox substitution, a competition redox fragmentation reaction always occurs, 
which mainly depends on the nuclearity of the cluster, the nature of the ligand, and 
their stoichiometric reaction. The non-redox substitution is more favored in the 
lower nuclearity clusters, which may be related to the relatively weaker inter- 
triangular Pt−Pt bond of Chini clusters with higher nuclearity [28]. For a variety of 
phosphine ligands, the monodentate and the flexible bidentate phosphines always 
tend to take the non-redox substitution, whereas more rigid bidentate phosphine 
ligands often result in the redox fragmentation reaction which affords the neutral Pt 
complexes [34]. In addition, the feeding amounts of ligands will lead to different 
reactions. The stoichiometric amounts of phosphine ligands favor the non-redox 
substitution, while the redox fragmentation will dominate in the excessive amounts 
of ligands (Figure 9.4a) [36, 37]. In addition, the related organic ligand-protected Pt 
carbonyl clusters can be prepared by a different redox conversion (condensation or 
oligomerization) [38].
The theoretical calculations have shown that external triangular Pt Chini clusters 
can act as a Lewis base, for example [Pt3n(CO)6n]2– (n = 2–6) can react with different 
Lewis’s acids to generate the responding acid–base adducts with retention of the 
structure of the parent Chini clusters via different reaction routes [12, 39]. Zacchini 
and coworkers reported the reactions of anionic platinum Chini clusters 
[Pt3n(CO)6n]2– (n = 2–4) with Ag(IPr)Cl (IPr = C3N2H2(C6H3
iPr2)2), which afford the 
neutral acid–base adducts of Pt9(CO)18(AgIPr)2 and Pt6(CO)12(AgIPr)2. The new 
bimetallic clusters containing NHC ligands have been determined by single crystal 
X-ray crystallography, which both retain the original trigonal prismatic structures 
and stereochemistry of the CO ligands of the parent platinum clusters; it is likely

that the bulky IPr ligand can stabilize the Lewis acid–base bimetallic clusters. 
Notably, two Lewis acid species of [Ag(IPr)]+ are a direct addition to the triangular 
face, resulting in the capped terminal face via the Pt−Ag bonds (Figure 9.4b) [35].
Funaioli et al. reported the synthesis of a series of Pt6 clusters substituted by some 
alkynyl derivative ligands. The Pt6(μ-PBut
2)4(CO)4(C≡C–R)2 (R = H, SiMe3, C6H5, 
OCH3, and CHO) cluster were obtained by dehydrohalogenation from the mixtures 
of certain terminal alkyne ligand and the symmetrical dichloride Pt6Cl2 cluster, 
according to the Sonogashira coupling route (1% CuI catalyst in the solvent of 
NEt2H). Acetylene ligand-based Pt6 cluster showed classical the tetragonal basis-
phenoid, the pseudo-tetrahedral core has two short equivalent Pt–Pt bonds and four 
equivalent long Pt-Pt edges [40]. Tanase et al. studied the linearly ordered trinuclear 
clusters coordinated by the tridentate phosphine ligand of bis(diphenyl-phospha-
nylmethyl)phenylphosphane (dpmp), [Pt2M(μ-dpmp)2(XylNC)2](PF6)2 (M  =  Pt, 
Pd; Xyl = 2,6-dimethylphenyl), and further constructed the linearly extended hex-
ametallic clusters containing the Pt2M2Pt2 metal core (M = Pt, Pd), which can be 
regarded as a kind of discrete rigid-rod molecule with radial size of 3 nm. The hexa-
platinum cluster [Pt6(μ-H)(μ-dpmp)4-(XylNC)2](PF6)3 was prepared by the reaction 
between the linear triplatinum cluster and reducing reagent of NaBH4. While the 
trinuclear Pt2Pd cluster readily reacted with NaOMe to form the Pt4Pd2 cluster of 
[Pt4Pd2(μ-H)(μ-dpmp)4(XylNC)2](PF6)3. 
The 
oxidized 
hexametallic 
clusters 
[Pt4M2(μ-dpmp)4(XylNC)2](PF6)4 (M = Pt, Pd) could be obtained via chemical oxi-
dation of Pt6 and Pt4Pd2 clusters with [Cp2Fe][PF6] respectively. The single crystal 
X-ray diffraction results of the Pt6 cluster showed the six linearly linked Pt atoms 
with near 180° bond angle of Pt–Pt–Pt, which is protected by four dpmp ligands and 
two terminated isocyanide ligands. The average Pt–Pt distances are 2.7–3.3 Å for the 
different Pt–Pt bonds, including outer and inner ones. For the Pt2Pd2Pt2 hexametal-
lic cluster, the central metal positions are selectively occupied by Pd atoms. This 
successful building strategy demonstrated here has blazed a path that constructs 
other long metallic chains in a bottom-up approach (Figure 9.4c) [41].
The low-valent Pd clusters tend to be stabilized by the π-accepting CO and PR3 
ligands. In recent times, some Pd clusters that do not contain CO or phosphine 
ligands have also been reported. Although the reduced Group 11 metal cluster pro-
tected by thiolate ligands has been reported with atomical characterization, the 
responding palladium clusters have not been reported. Dass et  al. have recently 
synthesized phenylethanethiol-protected Pd21L18 and Pd38L21S2 clusters, their size 
distribution and composition are confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ion-
ization mass spectra (MALDI-MS) and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry 
(ESI-MS), respectively. It is unfortunate that no suitable crystal can be used to get 
deeper identification for the atomically precise structure [42].
The Pd-thiolate complex is very stable, so it is not suitable to add reducing rea-
gents after their formation during the preparation of a reduced Pd-thiolate cluster. 
In recent times, Wu and coworkers proposed a novel synthesis strategy in which  
the reducing reagents are introduced together with thiolate ligands into the Pd pre-
cursor, pre-protected by a weak coordination reagent; they successfully obtained a 
novel reduced Pd8-thiolate cluster with a ditetrahedron metal kernel. The 

9  Ligand-Tailoring Platinum and Palladium Clusters
250
palladium acetate and the pre-protective ligand PPh3 were first co-dissolved in THF, 
then the water solution containing reducing reagent NaBH4 and 2,4-dimethylthio-
phenol (2,4-DMBTH) ligand was immediately added into the former under vigorous 
stirring. The target Pd8 cluster can be normally obtained after the key step about the 
simultaneous addition of NaBH4 and thiol as well as the pre-protection by PPh3. 
The Pd8 cluster consists of 8 Pd atoms with an interstitial boron atom, six 2,4-DMBT 
ligands, three PPh2, and two PPh3 ligands. The central B is reported for the first time 
in this type of metal cluster, demonstrating the special Pd−B bond to enrich the 
understanding of cluster chemistry. It is remarkable that this unique Pd8 cluster 
displays outstanding catalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction, which is 
better than that of Pd nanoparticles (~1.4 nm), Pd2 complexes, and commercial Pt/C 
catalysts. Correspondingly, the DFT results show that the free energy value for the 
rate-determining step of the Pd8 nanocluster is lower than that of the Pd2 complex 
and the (111) facet of Pd nanoparticles. This work shows that the special electronic 
structure and spatial configuration of palladium clusters have a crucial influence on 
their catalytic activity (Figure 9.5a) [44].
The ketimide ligand (R2C = N−) is a good π-acceptor that is able to stabilize low-
valent metal clusters and promote the formation of a metal−metal bond, which can be 
used as a suitable protective ligand to construct the Pd cluster. Hayton and coworkers

reported the synthesis and characterization of the mixed-valent Pd7 nanosheet-
shaped cluster, protected by the ketamide ligand, the Pd7(N = CtBu2)6 cluster was 
obtained via the reaction of PdCl2(PhCN)2, and Li(N = CtBu2). The Li(N = CtBu2) 
acted as a reducing agent in the reaction, which converted the PdIICl2(PhCN)2 start-
ing material into the mixed-valent Pd(I)/Pd(0) cluster. In the heptanuclear 
Pd7(N = CtBu2)6 cluster, the hexagonal planar (Pd7)6+ core was stabilized by six 
ketamide ligands, which surround the metal plane in the up and down fashion 
respectively. The planar (Pd7)6+ core is located in the inversion center and is com-
posed of 6 Pd atoms arranged in a hexagon, the seventh Pd(0) atom with a hexago-
nal planar coordination geometry is located in the center of the hexagon, this 
hexagonal planar coordination geometry is relatively rare. The DFT calculations 
demonstrate that the Pd7 cluster is a rare example of an all-metal aromatic nano-
cluster with hexagonal symmetry, which is similar to that of other 4d transition- 
metal aromatic clusters or benzene (Figure 9.5g). The reaction between the Pd7 clus-
ter and PPh3 produced the Pd(PPh3)3, which revealed the rich redox properties of 
the ketimide ligand and suggested that the Pd7(N = CtBu2)6 cluster can be used as a 
useful precatalyst for cross-coupling reactions [43].
Compared with the common monodentate ligand, constructing palladium clus-
ters by using multidentate ligands has also received great attention. The concerned 
tetradentate ligand is usually based on the additional chelating donors that are cou-
pled by a Lewis-basic coordination site. Breher’s group synthesized a novel trinu-
clear Pd3 cluster via the tris(methimazolyl)silanide ligands, which is obtained by the 
reaction of HSi(mtMe)3 ligand and the palladium precursor Pd(PtBu3)2 in CH2Cl2 at 
room temperature. The Pd3 cluster is composed of a triangle metal core and two 
stabilized anionic silanide ligands, the Si atoms adopt unusual μ3-capping coordina-
tion geometry on the triangular faces of the Pd3 cluster, and the Pd atoms are further 
coordinated by the terminal S atoms in the attached ancillary mtMe species 
(Figure 9.5h) [45]. Recently, Sunada and coworkers reported the synthesis of a but-
terfly-shaped Pd4 cluster Pd4(SiPh2)(SiPh3)2(CNtBu)4 and edge-sharing Pd6 cluster 
Pd6(SiPh2)2(μ-Cl)2(CNtBu)8 via the reaction of organosilicon ligand and Pd(CNtBu)2 
precursor. In this, the bridging silylene species plays a key role in the construction 
of these palladium clusters (Figure 9.5i,j) [46].
Strictly, some polynuclear Pd/Pt complexes that are bridged by coordination 
atoms do not belong to the cluster in the classical definition by Cotton and Johnson. 
In these polynuclear complexes, the metal atom is preserved relatively far apart 
without the formation of pivotal M−M bonds (the M⋯M distances are always 
longer than 0.3 nm). Yet, the peripheral geometry around the cluster core presents a 
diverse configuration, which is usually sustained by involving coordination bonds 
without additional metal–metal bonding interaction. The interaction of metals and 
bridging atoms is an integral part of the overall Pt/Pd clusters, so it is necessary to 
summarize these materials.
Alfonso Castiñeiras and coworkers reported two Pt4S4 clusters via the reaction 
between thiosemicarbazones derived ligands (H2AcbM: 5-acetyl-barbituric-4N- 
methyl thiosemicarbazone and H2AcbE: 5-acetylbarbituric-4N-ethyl thiosemicarba-
zone) with K2[PtCl4], which is the first tetranuclear Pt4S4 cluster structure with 
deprotonated tridentate ligands. The ligands are coordinated with Pt atoms, the 

9  Ligand-Tailoring Platinum and Palladium Clusters
252
thiolate sulfur atom, the azomethine nitrogen atom, and the alcoholate oxygen 
atom, respectively, delivering the square planar PtNOS2 structure, which combines 
each other to form the eight-membered Pt4S4 ring with a boat conformation. In the 
Pt4S4 cluster, the relatively long Pt–Pt distances suggest weak metal–metal interac-
tions. Two Pt4S4 clusters, constructed by the H2AcbM and H2AcbE ligand, have 
almost the same molecular structures; the only difference is the orientation of the 
substituents of the thiosemicarbazone ligand (Figure 9.6a) [47].
The commonly used ligands are known for numerous mono- and bidentate phos-
phines ligands and they are easily available. The most stable and frequently occur-
ring unit in the chemistry of chalcogenide-bridged cluster of Pd and Pt is the 
triangular metal-core [M3(μ3-S)2]2+ (M = Pd, Pt); the derivatives are commonly self-
assembled from the mononuclear precursors. In the typical trinuclear palladium 
and platinum cluster, the metal square plane shares the terminal metal atoms. 
Typically, phosphine ligands occupy six remaining coordination sites.
The diorganophosphinoyl ligand (R2PO) contain the soft phosphorus atoms and 
hard oxygen atoms which are both excellent donors to coordinate the metal atoms 
forming the classical trinuclear Pt clusters. The first Pt cluster with coordinated  
oxygen atom is reported by the Alcock and his coworkers by using the OPPh2

ligands. The dicationic Pt3 cluster [Pt3(μ3-OH)(OPPh2)3(PR3)3]2+ (PR3  =  PMePh2, 
PPh3) were synthesized by the reaction of Pt2 precursor with HBF4 or HPF6 [48]. The 
trinuclear Pt/Pd cluster with the composition of M3X3L3 (M = Pd, Pt; X = Cl, Br) can 
be synthesized through the reaction of MCl4
2− with organochalcogenolate ligands, 
such as Me2NCH2CH2X (X = S, Se) and 2-mercaptonicotinic acid. The mercaptoni-
cotinic acid contains a bidentate claw (N, S) and anchors to each metal atom, while 
the S atom bridges two metal atoms. The fourth coordination site in the M3S3 plane 
square geometry is occupied by a chloride ion (Figure 9.6b) [49]. The Cl-bridged tri-
nuclear Pt3Cl3 cluster [PtCl2(Me2NH)]3 is obtained by heating oligomers in the 
dichloromethane solution. The six-membered Pt3Cl3 ring has a crown-like structure, 
with all bridging chlorides on the same side of the Pt3 plane and the terminal Pt−Cl 
bond shorter than the bridging Pt−Cl bond (Figure 9.6c) [50]. In addition, the reac-
tion of acetylplatinum complex [Pt(COMe)Cl(PPh3)2] with the dibenzyldisufide 
ligand in refluxing CHCl3 yields a trinuclear cationic platinum cluster [Pt3(μ-S)
(μ-SBz)3(PPh3)3]Cl. The planar Pt3S3 core is capped by one S atom, the three PPh3 
ligands below the Pt3S3 plane, and the benzyl groups of SBz ligands above it 
(Figure 9.6d,e) [51]. Similarly, the trinuclear [Pd3(μ3-Se)(μ2-SePh)3(μ-PPh3)3]Cl clus-
ter is prepared through the reaction of PdCl2(PPh3)2 with PhSe− ligands. The Pd3Se4 
cluster is constructed by a capping μ3-Se atom linking all palladium atoms together, 
with each palladium atom bridged through phenylselenolate to two other palladium 
atoms (Figure 9.6f) [52], similar to the isomeric Pt3(μ3-S)(μ2-SPh)3(μ-PPh3)3 cluster.
Tetranuclear Pt-cluster carboxylates are usually prepared by the reduction of 
higher valent platinum complex, such as the simplest Pt4-cluster carboxylates, 
[Pt(OAc)2]4 is obtained from the PtCl4. The single crystal X-ray structural analyses 
showed that four Pt atoms in the [Pt(O2CR)2]4 cluster are bridged together by eight 
carboxylate ligands, which construct a square-planar metal core with the relatively 
strong Pt–Pt bond of c. 2.5 Å. In this, four carboxylic acid groups are nearly coplanar, 
while the others lie above and below this Pt4 plane, respectively. The Pt–O bond 
length from the coplanar carboxylate group is slightly longer than the latter 
(Figure 9.6g). The coplanar carboxylates in [Pt(OAc)2]4 can be substituted by other 
anionic ligands, so the [Pt(OAc)2]4 cluster has been exploited for preparing some 
other replaced platinum clusters [53–55]. In addition, these carboxylate ligands can 
also be substituted by the nitrogen-donor ligands to give the cationic clusters [56]. 
Differently, because of the poor basicity of the CF3COO− ligand, all the trifluoroac-
etate ligands in the Pt4(O2CCF3)8 cluster can be replaced by pivalate ligands. The 
substituted platinum clusters retain their initial Pt4 planar configuration with a 
similar Pt–Pt bond length [57].
For tetranuclear Pd clusters, the cyclometallation of benzylidene arylamines can 
form the Pd4 complexes; four Pd–L fragments share oxygen atoms with each other to 
generate a non-planar Pd4O4 cluster of alternating Pd and O atoms. In this Pd4 cluster, 
the metalated ligands usually act in a tridentate fashion [C, N, O]. Each Pd atom is 
coordinated to the carbon atom, the nitrogen atom, the oxygen atom of one flexible 
tridentate ligand, respectively, and another oxygen atom of a neighboring ligand 
(Figure 9.6h) [58, 59]. The hex nuclear palladium cluster can be obtained via the 
bridging nucleophilic chalcogenide ligands. Fenske and coworkers have studied some 

9  Ligand-Tailoring Platinum and Palladium Clusters
254
reactions to prepare Pd6 clusters, such as the reaction of bis(trimethylsilyl)chalcoge-
nide with Pd(II) precursors [60]. Kanatzidis reported the methano-thermal approach 
to discover novel soluble discrete Pd6 clusters in which the unprecedented [C2S6]6− 
ligand plays a key stabilizing role for the cluster frame. The hexanuclear Pd cluster, 
Na3[MeN(CH2CH2)3N]3[Pd6(C2S6)(S3)6] was obtained through the methanothermal 
reaction between Na2PdCl4 and Na2S4 in the presence of [MeN(CH2CH2)3 
NMe]I2 at 110 °C. Instead of Na2PdCl4 by using PdCl2 precursor, another Pd6 cluster 
Na2[MeN(CH2CH2)3N)]4[Pd6(C2S6)(S3)4(S4)2] was formed in a similar reaction at 
80 °C. In the Pd6(C2S6)(S3)6 cluster, six palladium atoms lie in the same plane. 
Interestingly, the (C2S6)6− ligand shows an ethane-like geometry, in which each sulfur 
atom coordinates to two different planar Pd atoms (Figure 9.6i) [61].
Stiefel et al. reported a novel coordinative unsaturated dithiolene-Pd cluster 
[PdS2C2(COOMe)2]6, with a hexameric structure that contains one dithiolene unit 
for each Pd atom without other ligands. The Pd6 cluster was prepared by a transmet-
allation reaction between (MeCN)2PdCl2 and (tmeda)ZnS2C2(COOMe)2. X-ray dif-
fraction analysis demonstrated that the symmetric cube-octahedron cluster core 
consisted of 6 palladium and 12 sulfur atoms, the latter are centered around this clus-
ter. Each sulfur atom occupied the edge midpoint, and each palladium atom was coor-
dinated by 4 sulfur atoms in a square plane. The [PdS2C2(COOMe)2]6 cluster was 
reduced via the borohydride to yield the anionic [(PdS2C2(COOMe)2)6]2− cluster with a 
similar structure (Figure 9.7a) [62]. Besides, the similar hexametric cube-octahedron 
palladium cluster has also been synthesized by using 2-aminoethanethiolate ligand 
(Figure  9.7b)  [63, 66]. Through the thiolate-transfer reactions between 
Cp2Ti(SCH2CH2SBz)2 and Pd(NCMe)4(BF4)2, Stephan and coworkers synthesized 
the cationic Pd6 cluster [Pd6(SCH2CH2SBz)8][BF4]4 in which each Pd atom was 
coordinated in a pseudo square planar sphere. Two central Pd atoms were bonded

to four thiolate sulfur atoms and four peripheral Pd atoms have chelating thioether 
sulfur atoms from each of the thiolate ligands (Figure 9.7c) [64].
As an important branch of polyoxometalates (POMs), the polyoxopalladates (POPs) 
based on PdII centers are an important class of palladium clusters that currently 
develop rapidly, and exhibit highly stable metal cores with diverse structures and 
compositions, delivering different promising applications especially catalysis 
(Figure 9.7d). This type of palladium-oxide cluster can usually be facile prepared in an 
aqueous solution by controlling the hydrolysis−condensation of square-planar PdO4 
units in the presence of external oxyacid heterogroups (AsO4
3−, PO4
3−). So far, more 
than 70 kinds of palladium-oxide clusters have been found, including cube, star, bowl, 
dumbbell, wheel, and open-shell prototypes. Kortz’s group has summarized the main 
structural types of POPs and discussed the structure-directing template effects induced 
by the guest ions on the resultant host−guest POPs [65]. The reported results showed 
that the structure of different palladium-oxide clusters is directly related to various 
fine synthetic parameters involving pH, temperature, ratio reagents, concentration, 
ionic strength, and countercations in the responding systems. The novel  
palladium-oxide clusters have been successfully prepared by the precise control of 
reaction parameters. For instance, Kortz and coworkers synthesized the cube-shaped 
(Pd13Se8O32)6– cluster via the reaction of Pd(OAc)2 and SeO2 in the solution of NaOAc 
at 80 °C (the initial system pH was 6.9 then the pH was adjusted to 6.4 by adding 
NaOH) [67]. In 2012, Hu et al. reported the synthesis of the star-shaped [Pd15(SeO3)10
(μ3-O)10]10– cluster via the same ratio and concentration of the starting  
reagents (Pd(OAc)2 and SeO2), while at the reduced pH (5.0) under a relatively  
gentle temperature (50 °C) [68]. Besides, Kortz and coworkers synthesized a novel [Na
2PdII
22O12(AsVO4)15(HAsVO4)]25− cluster via the reaction of Pd(NO3)2 with As2O5 in 
0.5 M NaOAc solution at pH 7.5–8.0 [69], which is similar to the synthetic conditions 
of reported cube-shaped [Pd13As8] cluster [70]. The key parameters allowing for the 
successful obtaining of [Na2PdII
22O12(AsVO4)15(HAsVO4)]25− cluster are lower Pd2+ 
concentration (0.063 M) and a pH range of 7.5–8.0. Especially, Pd2+ concentration 
seemed to be more important, because only the [Pd13As8] cluster was obtained in the 
same pH range when the Pd2+ concentration was 0.125 M.
9.3  ­Ligand Regulation and Modification of Platinum 
and Palladium Clusters
9.3.1  Ligand-Tailoring and Assembly of Platinum Clusters
On the basis of platinum Chini clusters as the milestone of Pt-cluster chemistry, it is 
possible to assemble several [Pt3(CO)6]2– units as a higher oligomer in the Chini 
series of formula [Pt3n(CO)6n]2– (n ≈ 10). More recently, the whole series of 
[Pt3n(CO)6n]2– have almost been completed, which shows that the largest oligomers 
self-assemble in the solid state, affording infinite conductive molecular Pt-wires 
(Figure  9.8a)  [72–74]. The platinum Chini clusters are composed of stacks of 
Pt3(CO)3(μ-CO)3 units, which have a trigonal prismatic structure and connect each 

9  Ligand-Tailoring Platinum and Palladium Clusters

other with strong intra-triangular Pt–Pt bonds, some units partially twisted along 
the pseudo-C3 axis. The inter-triangular Pt–Pt bonds become weaker as the nuclear-
ity of the cluster increases [28]. In general, the ionic low-nuclearity Chini clusters 
(n ≤ 4) adopt the zero-dimensional packing form. When n ≥ 5, the Pt3(CO)3(μ-CO)3 
units give rise to infinite chains, which can be discontinuous, semicontinuous, or 
continuous [72, 73, 75]. The assembled infinite Chini chains are morphologically 
similar to the Pt-wires covered with CO molecular, whose electrical resistivity varies 
significantly with the different arrangements. Not surprisingly, the platinum car-
bonyl clusters that are soluble in organic solvents have been used as print ink to 
manufacture the conductive Pt stripes by microinject molding [76]. This research 
paved the way for using platinum carbonyl clusters as printable precursors for fab-
ricating functional molecular wires and Pt-based nanomaterials.
Longoni et al. reported the one-dimensional (1D) [Pt9(CO)18(μ3-CdCl2)2]2− poly-
mer chain, which is self-assembled by the reaction of Lewis base of [Pt9(CO)18]2− 
with the Lewis acid of CdCl2 (Figure  9.8b). The structure of the dianionic 
[Pt9(CO)18]2− cluster consists of a distorted trigonal-prismatic moiety, two triangular 
faces, both having capped sides by μ3-CdCl2 groups linked by the Pt–Cd bonds (rang-
ing from 2.931(4) to 3.023(4) Å). Each Cd atom displays a twisted octahedral configu-
ration that is coordinated to one terminal and two unsymmetrical bridging Cl atoms. 
These inorganic linkers connect the adjacent [Pt9(CO)18]2− cluster, resulting in the 
1D [Pt9(CO)18(μ3-CdCl2)2]2− chains extending throughout the whole crystal. This 
work is unprecedented in the assembly of platinum carbonyl clusters, which opens 
up the prospect of 1D nanopatterning arrays of molecular metal clusters [71].
The large Pt carbonyl clusters that have so far been structurally characterized 
range from [Pt14(CO)18]4– up to [Pt44(CO)45]n– (Figure 9.8c–h). Their structures are

mainly pp (pentagonal prismatic), rather than the usual ccp structures in the bulk Pt 
and Pt nanoparticles. Thus, it can be seen that the structures of large Pt carbonyl 
clusters cannot be simply related to cluster size, that is, it is difficult to give an appar-
ent structure-size relationship [77]. This may be due to the interactions of metal-
ligands, which are not negligible and are as important as metal–metal interactions 
at the sub-nanometer scale. They both determine the structures of large metal clus-
ters. Similar to many Au clusters, the surface ligands have an important effect on the 
overall structure of the metal cluster [78–80].
Similar to the [Pt9(CO)18(μ3-CdCl2)2]2− polymer, the reactions of Pt carbonyl clus-
ters with different other metal salts or metal complexes have been widely employed to 
obtain bimetallic clusters or heterometallic doping Pt clusters. However, the intro-
duced metal atom is usually modified on the surface of the Pt carbonyl cluster, not 
included in the Pt core, which is mainly attributed to the strong Pt–Pt bonds that are 
not conducive to the inclusion of a heterometal atom [9]. Zacchini and coworkers 
synthesized the various bimetallic Pt6Sn6, Pt8Sn4, Pt9Sn7, and Pt10Sn4 clusters via the 
reaction of [Pt15(CO)30]2− with different additive amounts of SnCl2. The structural 
analysis shows that all the Pt–Sn clusters display the same characteristic of segregated 
two metals, which are composed and decorated on the surface by inorganic species of 
Sn2+ fragments including SnCl2, [SnCl3]−, [Cl2Sn(OH)SnCl2]−, and [Cl2SnOCOSnCl2]2−. 
These fragments behave as two electron donor ligands via the Sn atom and the C atom 
in the [Cl2SnOCOSnCl2]2−. Especially, the [Cl2SnOCOSnCl2]2− ligand may be viewed 
as a bis-stannyl-carboxylate or a carbonite ion [CO2]2−, stabilized by the coordination 
of metal atoms. The results demonstrate that the low valent Pt cores show a high affin-
ity for carbonyl ligands, but the Sn(II) ions are oxophilic and show strong Sn–O as well 
as Sn–Cl bonds. In addition, the Pt–Sn interactions are significant in stabilizing these 
surface-decorated PtSn alloy clusters (Figure 9.9a–c) [81].
In addition, the Pt–Cd clusters represent another kind of platinum carbonyl NCs 
decorated by inorganic ligands (metal complex) on the surface. Different from the 
Pt–Sn clusters, the Cd(II) complex acts like Lewis’s acids cap the surface of the Pt 
carbonyl cluster which behaves as a Lewis base, the opposite behavior is observed in 
the Pt–Sn carbonyl clusters. Zarra et al. reported the investigation of the reactions 
between [Pt3n(CO)6n]2– (n = 2–4) and cadmium bromide, which results in different 
Pt–Cd 
clusters 
depending 
on 
the 
experimental 
conditions, 
including 
[Pt13(CO)12{Cd5(μ-Br)5Br2(dmf)3}2]2– (Pt13Cd10), [Pt19(CO)17{Cd5(μ-Br)5Br3(Me2CO)2}
{Cd5(μ-Br)5Br(Me2CO)4}]2– (Pt19Cd10), [H2Pt26(CO)20(CdBr)12]8– (Pt26Cd12). The 
structural analysis shows that both Pt13Cd10 and Pt19Cd10 are composed of icosahe-
dral or bis-icosahedral Pt–CO cores decorated by the pentagonal Cd–Br fragments 
on the cluster surface, and the Pt26Cd12 possesses a cubic close-packed Pt26Cd12 
metal framework coordinated by CO and Br ligands. The transition from icosahe-
dral to close-packed metal structures is determined by the interactions of the metal 
kernels both with ligands and surface decorations. More importantly, based on these 
interesting Pt–Cd clusters, replacing the surface Cd-bound ligands with designed 
molecules can achieve functional clusters for purpose applications. Moreover, these 
clusters may be further exploited to obtain cluster-based assembled materials or to 
be bonded to the biomolecules or functionalized supports (Figure 9.9d–f) [82].

Functionalization of Chini clusters achieved by surface ligand modification is 
important in the possible applications. Especially for Pt/Pd-based metal catalysis, 
their clusters with organic ligands on miscellaneous supports, surfaces, or even nan-
oparticles can be exploited for their anchoring with heterogonous catalysis. 
Additionally, the presence of PTA ligands (1,3,5-triaza-7-phosphaadamantane) 
endows the [Pt12(CO)20(PTA)4]2– and [Pt15(CO)25(PTA)5]2– cluster with excellent 
water solubility. Based on this, the cytotoxicity of these functionalized Chini clusters 
against human ovarian cancer cell lines has been evaluated (Figure 9.10a,b) [34].  
Compared with unsubstituted Pt12 and Pt15 carbonyl clusters, two PTA-functionalized 
Pt12/Pt15 clusters display a considerably greater activity, which can be easily explained 
on the basis of their excellent water solubility.
Mashima and his coworkers have synthesized a novel tetraplatinum cluster by 
using a tetradendate ligand 1,3-bis(arylbenzamidinate)propane (DarBp), the flexi-
ble ligand consists of two amidinates linked with a trimethylene chain. The ligand-
modified Pt4 cluster units were prepared by reacting the [Pt(OAc)2]4 precursor with 
an excess amount of different nitrogen-donor ligands, respectively, and by forming 
the corresponding complex Pt4(μ-OCOCH3)6(κ4-N4-DtBuPhBp) (DtBuPhBp = 1,3-bis 
(para-tert-butylphenylbenzamidinate)propane), Pt4(μ-OCOCH3)6 (κ4-N4-DAniBp) 
(DAniBp = 1,3-bis(para-methoxyphenylbenzamidinate)propane), and Pt4(μ-OCOCH3)6 
(κ4-N4-DTolBp) (DTolBp = 1,3-bis(para-tolylbenzamidinate)propane) (Figure 9.10c). 
In all of these substituted Pt4 clusters, one carboxylate ligand is replaced by one 
incoming ligand. The coordination of the second nitrogen-including ligand to the

metal core was forbidden due to the steric hindrance stemming from the aromatic 
rings on the nitrogen atoms. Although there is only one steric N-ligand on the sur-
face of the Pt4 cluster, it cannot easily be replaced even in the presence of an excess 
of carboxylate ligand and does not prevent the substitution of other in-plane ligands. 
Furthermore, the Pt4-cluster-based tetramer Pt4(μ-OCOCH3)4(κ4-N4-DtBuPhBp)
[Fe(C5H4COO)2]4 was obtained through the self-assembly of the tetraplatinum pre-
cursor with an equimolar amount of 1,1′-ferrocenedicarboxylic acid, which is an 
indented quadrangle constructed by four Pt4 cluster units that occupy every corner 
of the quadrangle and four dicarboxylic acid ligands that link two adjacent Pt4 units 
in two different manners alternately (Figure 9.10d) [83].
Owing to the inherent optimal hydrogen binding energy of the platinum atom, 
the Pt-based Scatalysts remain the best choice for electrocatalytic hydrogen oxida-
tion reaction in alkaline exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs). Yet, many con-
ventional Pt-based catalysts are suffering from high costs and unsatisfactory stability, 
leading to the corresponding obstacles for industrial applications. The Pt cluster can 
give full play to its advantages of atomic-level precise engineering for minimal Pt 
dosage and maximize the performance of Pt-based electrocatalyst. Yuan and cow-
orkers reported an atomic-level precise triphenylphosphine stabilized Pt6(PPh3)4Cl5 
cluster as the efficient electrocatalyst for the hydrogen oxidation reaction in alka-
line. The Pt6 cluster delivered an outstanding electrocatalytic performance with 
high mass activity and high stability, which goes beyond both Pt single-atom and Pt 
nanoparticles, showing the unexpected relationship between cluster size and cata-
lytic performance. Furthermore, the ligand synergistic enhancement in the catalytic 
process was also confirmed by theoretical calculations; the triphenylphosphine 
ligand not only played a very important role in tuning the structure of atomically 
precise Pt6 cluster but also in regulating the d-band centers of metals for favorable 
adsorption kinetics of reaction intermediate (Figure 9.11) [84]. In addition, the tri-
phenylphosphine ligand with both σ donors and π acceptors results in the pπ–dπ

of active metal sites to a certain extent [85].
9.3.2  Modification of Palladium Clusters
Purposeful modification of atomically precise palladium clusters can lead to unex-
pected palladium-cluster-based functional materials. For instance, the easily obtained 
unsaturated Pd3(dppm)3(CO)2+ cluster (dppm: Ph2PCH2PPh2) is an appropriate Pd 
cluster model for further modified assembly materials, which is attributed to the 
combining ability for binding the carboxylate ions that link straight above the planar 
metal core via ionic interactions. The cavity formed by the phenyl group of dppm 
ligand enables the host–guest interaction of RCO2
− groups above the Pd3 core. 
Harvey and coworkers have successfully prepared the ionic assemblies Pd3⋯MCP 
and Pd3⋯DCP⋯Pd3 (MCP and DCP both are the Zn-based porphyrins ligand,  
MCP: 5-(4-carboxylphenyl)-10,15,20-tristolyl(porphyrinato)zinc; DCP: 5,15-bis(4-
carboxylphenyl)-15,20-bistolyl(porphyrinato)zinc). The optimized geometries of the 
Pd3 assemblies were calculated using DFT; the computed Pd–O bond lengths rang-
ing from 2.411 to 3.368 Å are consistent with ionic interactions. The Pd3⋯MCP and 
Pd3⋯DCP⋯Pd3 assemblies are non-emissive due to the oxidative quenching of the 
Pd3 cluster for the excited porphyrins ligand, they examine the electron transfer rate 
of assemblies by the transient absorption spectra. The photoinduced electron trans-
fers in these ionic assemblies Pd3⋯MCP and Pd3⋯DCP⋯Pd3 are ultrafast (<85 fs), 
indicating that it is not necessarily required to generate a strong coordination bond

or a bent geometry between the donor and the acceptor obtaining fast electron injec-
tion  [86]. Harvey’s group soon studied the comparison of photoinduced electron 
transfer behavior toward Pd3⋯porphyrin-ligand (TCPBP = 9,18,27,36-Tetrakis[meso-
(4-carboxyphenyl)]-tetrabenzoporphyrinatozinc), 
and 
Pd3···tetrabenzoporphyrin-
ligand (TCPP  =  5,10,15,20-tetrakis[meso-(4-carboxyphenyl)] porphyrinatozinc) 
assemblies using femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. DFT computations 
showed that the average ionic Pd-O distance of Pd3⋯TCPBP assembly is shorter than 
that of Pd3⋯TCPP assembly. The results of transient absorption showed that the ligand 
modification from porphyrin to tetrabenzoporphyrin has little effect on the kinetic 
behavior of these processes (Figure 9.12) [87].
Mimoun et al. reported the synthesis and characterization of a series of tetranu-
clear palladium cluster Pd4(RCO2)4(tBuOO)4 based on the tert-butyl peroxide car-
boxylate ligands. The four Pd atoms are located at the corners of a square plane, and 
the four trichloroacetato bridging ligands are above and below this Pd4 square, 
respectively. The terminal oxygen atoms of the tert-butyl peroxide ligands lie approx-
imately in the Pd4 cluster plane and bridge Pd atoms. Furthermore, they studied 
these Pd4 clusters as the efficient reagents for the selective oxidation of terminal 
olefins to methyl ketones at ambient temperature, and as the catalysts for the 
ketonization of terminal olefins. The reaction of 1-hexene with Pd4(CH3CO2)4 
(tBuOO)4 cluster in anhydrous benzene produced a mixture of 2-hexanone (40%) 
and 2-acetoxy-1-hexene (40%), which might be stemming from the nucleophilic 
attack of the tert-butyl peroxidic group and the acetate group on the olefin. Note­
worthy, when the nucleophilic acetate ligand was replaced by the strong electron- 
withdrawing trifluoroacetate ligand, the formation of parallel vinylic ester was obvi-
ously inhibited (Figure 9.12f). The trifluoroacetate-modified Pd6 cluster reacts with

1-hexene under the same conditions to produce only 2-hexanone with a 98% yield 
more quickly. A series of experiments of Pd6 clusters, modified with different sub-
stituent ligands in this reaction, showed that the results are strongly dependent on 
the electron-attracting properties of the carboxylate group bound on the palladium 
cluster. When the electron acceptor character of palladium toward olefins increases 
the selectivity, the relative rate increases obviously [88].
9.4  ­Conclusion and Perspectives
Noble metal catalysts, especially platinum- and palladium-based nanoparticles, 
have attracted extensive interest in commercial development due to their outstand-
ing catalytic properties in the field of energy conversion. However, regardless of 
many reported mature Pt/Pd-based catalysts, the structures of Pt/Pd-based materi-
als still mainly focus on the research of the sub-nanometer scale, which severely 
limits the in-depth understanding of the atomic level structure-activity relationship. 
The emerging ligand-protective platinum and palladium clusters with well-defined 
structures have been ideal models for linking the molecular mechanism of  
Pt/Pd-based materials. While most attention has been paid to Ag- and Au-based 
clusters in the past few years, the research on Pt/Pd clusters is also indispensable. In 
this chapter, the achievements in the synthesis and ligand-modifying of Pt/Pd clus-
ters have been summarized, showing some representative examples. The structure 
and coordination ability of different ligands and the respective synthetic strategy 
will have a significant impact on the number of kernel atoms and the entire arrange-
ment of Pt/Pd clusters. As a major conclusion of this chapter, considering all the 
examples reported herein, the importance of atomically precise ligand-stabilized 
Pt/Pd cluster is emphasized, and there is still much research to be done. The reactiv-
ity and reaction mechanisms of precious Pt/Pd cluster-based catalysts are different 
from those of single-metal-atom catalysts, which can be attributed to the unique 
spatial configuration and electronic structure of the cluster, and potential coopera-
tive effect. As a new type of catalyst, Pt/Pd clusters may exhibit unexpected catalytic 
performance, and their atomically precise structures can be used to correlate their 
catalytic behavior and structure, which can stimulate the discovery of unprece-
dented catalytic mechanisms and novel Pt/Pd catalysts in the future. Compared to 
the huge amount of research on noble Pt/Pd nanoparticles, the catalytic application 
of Pt/Pd clusters is still in its infancy. Further investigation is needed to determine 
how to obtain stable Pt/Pd clusters through specific synthesis methods or ligand 
regulation strategies. To some extent, the formation of Pt/Pd clusters can be con-
trolled well by the elaborately designed ligands combined with a targeted synthesis 
scheme, which is a promising prospect. We hope that the content of this chapter 
will contribute to a deep and comprehensive understanding of the synthesis and 
ligand-modification of Pt/Pd clusters, and promote the rapid development of  
relevant research fields.

10.1  ­Introduction
Metal oxo clusters (MOCs) are a diverse class of discrete polyhedral nanosized clus-
ters which consist of cationic inorganic cores, stabilized by organic or inorganic cap-
ping ligands. They have attracted considerable and continuous attention due to their 
potential applications in catalysis, magnetism, and optics [1, 2]. Although similar to 
polyoxometalates (POMs), MOCs are distinguishably investigated in the literature 
since POMs are intrinsically anionic compounds, while MOCs are typically neutral. 
POMs have been extensively studied and applied in catalysis such as photo-/electro-
catalytic reactions and CO2 conversion  [3–5]. In comparison, MOCs are far less 
explored as discrete species and have been widely investigated as building blocks for 
the bottom-up assembly of novel functional materials through strong coordination 
bonds with various organic linkers, including the intensively studied metal–organic 
frameworks (MOFs) [6]. Notably, the relatively strong coordination bonds and versa-
tile coordination modes within these MOC-assembled materials endow the frame-
work with diverse structures and topologies, high chemical stability, and exceptional 
performance in areas such as storage, separation, and catalysis [7].
Extensive MOFs have been successfully designed and synthesized with MOCs as 
secondary building blocks through reticular synthesis, supermolecular building 
block (SBB) approach, and ligand exchange strategies [7]. MOC-based nodes endow 
MOFs with intrinsically porous structures and highly tunable pore environments, 
which conveniently integrate the functionality of cluster units and organic link-
ers [8]. Their permanent pores, often on the nanometer scale, provide ideal spaces 
for molecular recognition, chemical storage, and the directed conversion of sub-
strates. The creation and modification of pore structures with optimized size, func-
tionality, and diversity can be precisely tuned at the molecular level by rationally 
designing building blocks and synthetic procedures [9]. The number, arrangement, 
and density of functional groups on the surface of MOCs affect the crosslinking 
density of the final extended material. Meanwhile, metal ions with varying redox 
activity and Lewis acidity are able to integrate at the MOC nodes adjacent to the 
functionalized linkers, which contributes to sophisticated structure fabrication with

specific functions [10]. MOC is evenly distributed in the framework material, pro-
moting the accessibility of guest molecules to catalytic centers. The stability and 
chemical properties of metal clusters largely depend on their core, ligands, and 
environments. By selecting suitable organic linkers, bandgaps of MOCs can be 
rationally optimized to maximize their catalytic activity. Therefore, MOCs are prom-
ising compounds for the development of novel functional materials, and a broad 
understanding of precise modification and hierarchical assembly of MOCs is essen-
tial to exploit the development of functionality-oriented MOC-based materials in 
the enrichment of nanotechnology and material science.
MOCs based on group III and IV metals have attracted increasing attention due to 
their good stability and easily isolated structures, especially Zr, Ti, and lanthanides 
(Ln, from La to Lu) oxo clusters. Large numbers of Zr, Ti, and Ln clusters with pre-
cise atomic structure have been synthesized and structurally characterized by single-
crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) analysis, which provides precise structural data for 
understanding the structure–property relationships at the atomic level [11, 12]. Due 
to the complicated process of MOC synthesis, starting materials and reaction condi-
tions have been crucial in the successful assembly of cluster compounds. The stabil-
ity and chemical properties of these clusters largely depend on their core, ligands, 
and environments. What is more, Zr4+, Ti4+/Ln3+ with harder Lewis acidity can form 
much stronger coordination bonds with carboxylates in comparison to relatively soft 
Lewis acidic metal species according to Pearson’s soft and hard acid–base principle. 
Therefore, Zr4+, Ti4+/Ln3+-based MOFs generally have improved chemical, hydro-
thermal, and thermal stability compared with MOFs constructed from metals of 
other groups. Diverse Zr oxo, Ti oxo, and Ln oxo cluster building blocks have been 
successfully incorporated for the construction of extended frameworks, which have 
exhibited unique guest adsorption, fluorescence, and photocatalysis properties. In 
the past decades, diverse synthetic strategies have been developed for the prepara-
tion and assembly of novel Zr oxo, Ti oxo, and Ln oxo clusters, and also the engineer-
ing of their properties. After some reviews on Zr oxo, Ti oxo, and Ln oxo clusters, 
respectively [12, 13], a new and comprehensive review of all these poly-oxo clusters 
would further benefit this area as continuous breakthroughs have been made in the 
preparation, modification, and applications of MOCs.
In this part, we mainly concentrate on the development of diverse Zr oxo, Ti oxo, 
and Ln oxo clusters stabilized by various ligands. Besides an introduction to recently 
developed synthetic approaches, precise post-modification and assembly through 
supramolecular interactions or coordination bonding have also been summarized. 
The critical challenges and potential solutions, future research directions, and pros-
pects are also discussed in this text.
10.2  ­Structure and Properties of Zirconium Oxo 
Clusters (ZrOCs)
Zr oxo clusters (ZrOCs) have essentially been prepared by two distinct approaches, 
which differ in the aqueous or organic nature of the reaction medium. In aqueous 
solutions, sulfate and peroxide are common capping ligands, which have a great 

10.2  ­Structur e and  Propertie s of  Zirconium  Ox o Clusters  (ZrOCs

influence on the formation of ZrOCs. On the other hand, alkoxy and carboxylate 
ligands have been predominantly used to stabilize ZrOCs, which depend on the con-
densation between organic species. A series of ZrOCs have been prepared and fea-
tured from Zr4 a to Zr70 clusters. Moreover, ZrOCs with mixed carboxylate ligands 
can be obtained by direct synthesis or post-synthetic ligand exchange.
10.2.1  Formation of Zr Oxo Cluster in Aqueous Medium
In an aqueous solution, the tetrameric structure [Zr4(OH)8(H2O)16]8+ is the pri-
mary hydrolysis product using ZrOCl₂·8H₂O as the metal source, which is an ion 
highly prone to hydrolysis, even under very acidic conditions. A tetrameric cluster 
of [Zr4(OH)8(H2O)16]Cl8·12H₂O was first isolated and structurally characterized 
through single-crystal X-ray diffraction by Clearfied et al., in which four Zr atoms 
are located at the corners of a tetragonal plane with one crystallographically unique 
Zr atom. The Zr atom is bound to four waters and four bridging OH− groups in its 
coordination sphere. Each Zr is linked to two neighboring Zr via two μ2-hydroxo-
bridges, resulting in the tetramer (Figure 10.1a). Then, a tetrameric zirconium clus-
ter was also isolated in a supramolecular complex with cucurbituril [14]. Increasing 
the pH of the solution could lead to the aggregation of tetrameric units into other 
species. The octameric [Zr8(OH)20(H2O)24Cl12] (Zr8 cluster) species have been ver-
ified to be in equilibrium with tetrameric [Zr4(OH)8(H2O)16Cl6]2+ depending on 
the pH of ZrOCl2 solution through small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) measure-
ments [15]. In a highly acidic solution, the tetramer is the main species present in 
the solution. The octamer becomes the most dominant species when lowering the 
acid concentration. The z-averaged radius and the intensity at zero angle (a measure 
of the molecular weight of the species) data provide a substantial definition of the 
chemical process. However, the octamer has not been isolated despite being identi-
fied through SAXS measurement in solution.
Some new Zr oxo clusters have also been isolated by reacting primary tetramer 
[Zr4(OH)8(H2O)16]8+ cluster with various ligands. Adding peroxide ligands into the 
solution of [Zr4(OH)8(H2O)16]8+ cluster leads to disassembly and reassembly reaction 
of Zr4 cluster and yields two isolated structures, [Zr4(OH)4(μ-O2)2(μ4-O)(H2O)12]

(Zr25 cluster) [15]. ZrTd cluster is isolated from a 10:1 peroxide/Zr reaction solu-
tion, in which the μ4-oxo centered Zr-tetrahedron has four bridging hydroxyls and 
two bridging peroxides along the six edges of the tetrahedron. Each of the four Zr 
atoms is capped by three terminal aqua ligands and exhibits a distorted square anti-
prism geometry (Figure 10.1b). The Zr25 cluster is isolated from a reaction solution 
of 1 : 1 peroxide/Zr, which exhibits a pentagonal assembly of 25 Zr-oxy/peroxo/
hydroxyl polyhedral. The pentagonal topology can be described as an inner five-
membered ring connected to the outer ring via μ3 oxo and hydroxyl groups 
(Figure 10.1c). The formation pathways of ZrTd and Zr25 in water were described by 
SAXS, pair distribution function (PDF), and electrospray ionization mass spectrom-
etry (ESI-MS), which is partially reversible depending on the solution pH. However, 
the intermediates in the assembly of ZrTd and Zr25 have yet to be isolated and struc-
turally characterized.
The addition of sulfate to the solutions of the tetramer results in a range of solids 
with extended hydroxo- and sufato-bridged frameworks. The aqueous chemistry of 
Zr sulfates has been studied in detail, and several crystalline species of oligomeric Zr 
oxysulfates have been described. In general, the introduction of sulfate ligands into 
Zr solutions prefers to form larger Zr oxo clusters. Meanwhile, the concentration of 
sulfate ligands plays a dominant role in the solution speciation of the final cluster 
structure. The lower concentration of sulfate promotes the formation of mono-/
dimeric species in solution which tends to condense into larger clusters. However, 
higher amounts of sulfate have been shown to inhibit the condensation of the dis-
crete ZrOCs since it passivates the clusters surface. At relatively lower temperatures 
(from 40 to 100 °C), [Zr6O4(OH)4(H2O)8(HCOO)4(SO4)4]·2HCl·3H2O (Zr6 clus-
ter) was obtained through the hydrothermal treatment of reaction solution with a 
concentration of H2SO4 above 0.15 M, which was capped with formate, [16] sulfate, 
and aqua ligands (Figure 10.2a). While the concentration of sulfate decreased to 
0.15 M, the [Zr17O8(OH)24(H2O)12(HCOO)12(SO4)8] (Zr17 cluster) was formed in 
which the heptadecameric [Zr17O8(OH)24]28+ core contains four Zr5 building blocks 
(Figure 10.2b) [17]. At higher temperatures (90 and 100 °C), the Zr17 cluster was the 
only product regardless of the concentration of H2SO4, since high temperature

promotes the formation of high-nuclearity clusters. Higher temperature tends to 
induce further oxolation of oligomeric species leading to the formation of larger  
species. Toroidal Zr70(SO4)58(O/OH)146·xH2O (Zr70 cluster) was the largest species 
that crystallized from aqueous sulfate-containing solutions and displays a pseudo-10-
fold rotational symmetry of Zr6 octahedra bridged by an additional Zr in the outer 
rim of the ring [17, 18]. The Zr70 cluster exhibits very poor solubility in water and in 
ethanol. Furthermore, torus units can be arranged in chain and network structures, 
which display high permanent porosity and BET surface area.
10.2.2  Formation of Zr Oxo Clusters in Organic Medium
In organic medium, Zr alkoxides are commonly used as a Zr source carboxylate, and 
alkoxy ligands are predominantly used to stabilize the ZrOCs formed. A three-step 
mechanism was proposed for the formation of ZrOCs in organic solution which 
have been proved through HPLC, EXAFS, Raman, and NMR spectroscopy analysis 
simultaneously (Scheme 10.1) – (I) The Zr alkoxides precursor condenses with car-
boxylic acids to release alcohol with partial substitution of alkoxide groups by car-
boxylic acids; (II) The carboxylate ligands react with the released alcohol to form 
water with esters as byproduct. (III) Water triggers hydrolysis and condensation of 
partially substituted building blocks in solution to form ZrOCs. The structures of 
the resulting aggregates and reaction rate depend on the ratio of carboxylate acid 
with respect to the Zr source as the increase of the ratio may favor the cluster with 
lower nuclearity. A large number of ZrOCs have been reported using mostly carbox-
ylic acids as ligands ranging from Zr3 to Zr26 clusters. The introduction of mixed 
functional ligands to form ZrOCs with mixed carboxylate ligands can lead to great 
alteration and regulation of the original properties. Carboxylated Zr6 and Zr12 clus-
ters based on octahedral Zr oxo cores have been more commonly studied due to 
their great stability, availability, and experimental versatility, which could afford 
opportunities to study and probe the ligand exchange dynamics in the formation of 
mixed-carboxylated ZrOCs. In this section, we initially introduce these known 
structures and then provide an overview of the ligand exchange in Zr6 and Zr12 clus-
ters with mixed carboxylate ligands.
Zr3 clusters feature the same μ-O centered Zr3 plane in which each Zr atom bounds 
to additional capping ligands. [(Cp2Zr)3(μ-OH)3(μ-O)](BPh4) (Zr3 cluster) has 
been isolated in dichloromethane/tetrahydrofuran solution, which exhibits approxi-
mately C3v symmetric with two Cp ligands bound to each Zr atom (Figure 10.3a) [19].

These trinuclear clusters could act as a 3-connected secondary building unit (SBU) 
with pyramidal geometry for the assembly of supramolecular polyhedral coordina-
tion cages through carboxylate exchange strategies. [Zr4O2(OMc)12] (OMc  =   
methacrylate, Zr4 cluster), which exhibits a non-symmetric butterfly shape, is 
isolated from a n-propanol solution of Zr(OnPr)4 with excess methacrylic acid 
(Figure 10.3b) [20]. The oxo zirconium methacrylate clusters [Zr6(OH)4O4(OMc)12] 
(Zr6 cluster) are obtained when Zr(OnPr)4 reacts with a fourfold excess of meth-
acrylic acid (OMc) in n-propanol [21], in which each Zr atom is anti-square prismati-
cally coordinated by eight oxygen atoms, and the Zr6O8 core with alternate μ-O and 
μ-OH ligands is capped with 12 methacrylate ligands through X-ray diffraction anal-
ysis (Figure 10.3c). Some related clusters have also been obtained with other carboxy-
late ligands in similar conditions. The presence of additional coordinating groups in 
the ligands could lead to an open Zr6 cluster structure.
In marked contrast to the reported octahedral arrangement of the Zr6O8 core, a 
unique Zr6 core structure has been observed in [Zr6(μ-O)2(μ-O)3(μ-Hdihybo)6 
(H2O)6]·2Bu4NCl·2CH3OH cluster with a trigonal-prismatic arrangement. The 
three edge-sharing zirconium atoms are linked by one μ3-O atom to generate a 
Zr3(μ3-O) subunit. The two Zr3(μ3-O) subunits, featuring a pyramidal mode, 
are connected by three O2− atoms via a vertex-sharing mode to form a Zr6O5 core 
structure capped by six Hdihybo2− ligands and six terminal water molecules 
(Figure 10.4a) [22]. Zr8 and Zr9 clusters have not been observed as discrete species 
yet, but they have been observed as MOF secondary building units. [Zr10O6(OH)4 
(OOC–C6H4-OH)8(OOC–C6H4O)8]·6PrOH (Zr10 cluster) has been formed when 
Zr(OPr)4 reacts with 10 equivalent of salicylic acid in propanol, which comprises a 
central Zr6 octahedron and is linked with two Zr atoms on each side through bridg-
ing bidentate salicylate ligands (Figure  10.4b)  [23]. [Zr6O4(OH)4(OOCR)12]2, 
(RCOO = acrylate, Zr12 cluster) has been obtained and consists of two Zr6 sub-units 
which are connected by four carboxylate bridges (Figure 10.4c). The cluster is highly 
dynamic in solution, due to site exchange of the carboxylate ligands. Various Zr12 
clusters with Zr6 dimers of type [Zr6O4(OH)4(OOCR)12]2 have been synthesized 
with a broad range of carboxylate ligands under reaction conditions [24–26].

[Zr18O21(OH)2(OOCPh)28] (Zr18 cluster) have been prepared through an assem-
bly of ZrCl4 and benzoic acid, with the assistance of thiourea in dried acetonitrile, 
which consists of a [Zr18O21(OH)2] core terminated by 28 bridging carboxylates [27]. 
Zr18 skeleton can be disintegrated into four Zr5(Zr) pentagons. Two Zr5(Zr) penta-
gons share an edge to form Zr10 units and two Zr10 units are further connected into 
Zr18 units via two vertex-sharing edges (Figure 10.5a). Zr18 displayed photocatalytic 
activity towards H2 production under visible light irradiation, which may pave the 
way to explore ZrOCs as a new type of visible-active photocatalyst. [Zr26O18(OH)30 
(HCOO)38]·5(HCOOH)·kH2O (Zr26 cluster) has been isolated from a ZrOCl2·8H2O 
solution in DMF with a high concentration of formic acid, in which a central Zr6 unit 
is connected to the other four Zr6 moieties through corner-sharing mode [28]. Four 
external Zr6 units are linked through μ-OH and μ-COOH bridging ligands to form a 
ring structure, in which some of the bridging carboxylate ligands are defected by site 
sharing with water molecules as shown in crystal structure evidence (Figure 10.5b).
ZrOCs with mixed carboxylate ligands are an important class of compounds  
due to the possibility of tuning the cluster properties by introducing additional

functional groups, different hydrophobicity and/or size, which can be obtained by 
direct synthesis and post-synthetic ligand exchange strategies. In direct synthesis, 
clusters are one-pot synthesized from a mixture of carboxylic acids. For example, 
mixed carboxylate Zr6 cluster [Zr6O4(OH)4(OMc)8(iso-butanoate)4(BuOH)] has 
been isolated from n-butanol solution of Zr(OBu)4, methacrylic acid, and isobutyric 
acid [29]. The uniform distribution of two kinds of carboxylate ligands has been 
demonstrated through ROESY and NOESY NMR spectra experiments. In the post-
synthetic ligand exchange strategies, mixed-carboxylate clusters have been obtained 
by full or partial carboxylate exchange after the synthesis, which could introduce car-
boxylate ligands that are difficult to directly introduce during direct synthesis. The 
proposed mechanism involves a constant switch between the chelating and bridging 
coordination mode of the carboxylate ligands, which has been proven by NMR spec-
troscopic evidence and molecular dynamic studies of carboxylate ligands on the clus-
ter surface. Ligand exchange is a substitution-driven rather than a disassemble/ 
reassemble process that can be driven by the concentration of the carboxylates in 
solution, which has been observed for the [Zr4O2(OMc)12] cluster [30]. In conclu-
sion, ligands with additional coordinating groups can be introduced to afford mixed-
carboxylated ZrOCs with tunable structure and properties.
10.3  ­Structure and Properties of Titanium Oxo 
Clusters (TiOCs)
A large number of TiOCs structures have been documented with cluster nuclearity 
ranging from Ti6 to Ti52 centers [31–34]. Being extremely prone to fast and spontane-
ous hydrolysis of Ti4+ ions in water, the uncontrollable design and synthesis have 
hampered the development of polyoxo‑titanium clusters. Diverse synthetic meth-
ods have been developed for the preparation and engineering of novel TiOCs from 
traditional strict inert condition synthesis to solvo/ion-thermal [13, 35, 36]. In addi-
tion to these extensively reported alkoxides and carboxylates capping ligands, phos-
phonates, and N donor organic ligands have also been reported. Ligand exchange 
and doping techniques have been developed to impart additional structural diver-
sity and tailor their chemical reactivity. In this section, the structural diversity of 
titanium oxo clusters will be discussed according to different capping ligands. Then 
bandgap engineering and light absorption behaviors of TiOCs through ligand func-
tionalization and doping strategies will also be briefly discussed.
10.3.1  Structural Diversity of Titanium Oxo Clusters
As ideal structure and reaction models of TiO2, TiOCs with precise structural infor-
mation, are beneficial for further understanding the structure–property relationship 
of TiO2. Extensive TiOCs with different structures, nuclearity, and functional ligands 
have been successfully designed and synthesized [37, 38]. The coordinated ligands 
efficiently protect the Ti–O metal core clusters by coordination bonds with O, P, and 
N atoms, which correspond to carboxylate, phosphonate, and N-donor ligands.

10.3.1.1  Carboxylate Ligands-Stabilized Titanium Oxo Clusters
The carboxylate-substituted titanium poly-oxo-alkoxy clusters are an important sub-
class of titanium-oxo clusters, in which carboxylic acids react with titanium alkoxides 
at the molecular level to act as ligands. The main frameworks of carboxylate-­
substituted TiOCs are presented in Figures 10.6 and 10.7 [38]. [Ti2O(OiPr)2(HOiPr)2 
(OOCCCl3)4] is the least condensed titanium oxo-alkoxy-carboxylate cluster in which 
a common μ2-oxo ligand bridges symmetrical octahedral titanium atoms [32]. A fam-
ily of [Ti3O(OR)8(OOCR′)2] clusters (R = OCH2CMe3, R′ = H, Me or CH2CMe3) 
have been isolated, which consist of two six-coordinated titanium atoms and one 
five-coordinated assembly by a μ3-oxo bridge [39]. There are three different structures 
of titanium-oxo tetramers – [Ti4O2(OiPr)6(OOCR′)6] [40], [Ti4O2(OR)10(OOCR′)2]  
[41] and [Ti4O4(OR)4(OOCR′)4] [42]. Four structural types of hexanuclear TiOCs 
have been described, in which titanium atoms are all six-coordinated. [Ti6O4(OR)8 
(OOCR′)8] [40] consists of two centrosymmetric trinuclear oxo-centered units. Two 
structural types have been reported for [Ti6O4(OR)12(OOCR′)4] [42], in which type I 
with centrosymmetric structure is composed of two typical M3O13 unit linked by edge-
sharing through two μ2-oxo bridges, and type II structure consists of two identical 
Ti3O4 core units. The symmetric structure of [Ti6O6(OR)6(OOCR′)6] consists of two 
staggered triangular units connected through μ-oxo and μ-OOCH bridging 
ligands [43]. [Ti9O8(OnPr)4(OMc)16] cluster consists of a ring of nine TiO6 octahe-
dras linked by six μ2- and two μ3-oxide bridges [44].

10  Metal Oxo Clusters

[Ti12O12(OR)18(OOCR′)6] cluster consists of two M3O13 structural units which 
share two edges with each other  [45]. In the [Ti14O19(OH)(OtBu)13(OOCMe)4] 
(Ti14) cluster, there are three types of Ti atoms capped by acetate and t-butoxide 
groups – six-coordination with distorted octahedral geometry, five-coordination with 
square pyramidal geometry, and four-coordination with tetrahedral geometry [32]. 
Ti18O25(OtBu)12(OOCMe)10 (Ti18 cluster) can be considered as a Ti14 cluster with 
an additional group of four titanium atoms, in which the metal core is connected 
through μ2-oxo bridges, μ3-O, and μ4-oxo ligands [32]. Similar to the Ti14 cluster, 
Ti28O40(OtBu)20(OOCMe)12 (Ti28 cluster) appears to be a pair of 14 titanium  
atom 
clusters 
joined 
through 
two 
Ti‑oxygen 
bridges 
[32]. 
Recently,  
Ti13O10(o-BDC)4(SAL)4(OiPr)16 (Ti13 cluster) has been successfully prepared, 
which is stabilized by multidentate chelate coordination of dicarboxylate and salicy-
late ligands [46]. The central TiO6 shares edges with four neighboring TiO6 in S4 
symmetry (Ti5O22). Four Ti2O10 connect with the Ti5O22 core by sharing the 
corners  and forming paddle-like arrangement (Figure  10.8a). A 3.6 nm cluster  
Ti52(μ-OH)2(μ-O)14(μ3-O)50(μ4-O)8(PA)34(OiPr)28 (Ti52 cluster) has been reported 
with precise atomic structure, which possesses the largest size in the family of TiOCs. 
The crystal growth of such large Ti52 is based on a stepwise interlayer assembly 
approach from Ti6 substructures [34], which can be divided into one central Ti28 layer, 
two Ti10 ladders decorated from two sides, and four apical Ti atoms (Figure 10.8b).
10.3.1.2  Phosphonate-Stabilized Titanium Oxo Clusters
Due to the strong stability of Ti−O−P bonds and similar coordination properties  
to carboxylates, phosphonates have been used as protective ligands for TiOCs.

10.3  ­Structur e and  Propertie s of  Titanium  Ox o Clusters  (TiOCs

The phosphonate ion can adopt several coordination modes, such as monodentate, 
bidentate, or tridentate due to its claw-like trioxide-based configuration, which 
largely expand the TiOCs family. Some isostructural TiOCs can be obtained by the 
reaction of titanium alkoxides with phosphinates or carboxylates. The cluster 
[Ti4O4(OiPr)4(OOPPh2)4] obtained by the reaction of Ti(OiPr)4 with Ph2P(O)OH 
has the same structure as the carboxylate substituted analogs, the [Ti4O4(OR)4 
(OOCR′)4] clusters discussed above [47]. The clusters [Ti6O4(OiPr)10(OAc)2(O3PR)2] 
(OAc = acetate) have been obtained with a large variety of functional and nonfunc-
tional groups R under a range of reaction conditions [48]. This cluster type consists 
of a cubic Ti6P2O10 cluster core with two parallel Ti3O triangles connected by μ2-oxo 
and phosphonate bridges. H2[Ti18(μ3-O)14(μ2-O)6(O3P-Phen)2(PA)16(OiPr)14] 
(HPA = propionic acid) cluster has been obtained with both phosphonate and pro-
pionic acids as respective bridging ligands. The centrosymmetric nanoscale Ti18 core 
can be considered as two [Ti9(μ3-O)7(μ2-O)3(PA)8(OPri)7] subunits held together by 
a couple of bridging O3P-Phen ligands [49]. Nanosized phosphonate-functionalized 
[Ti26O26(OEt)39(PhenPO3)6]Br cluster with triply bridging binding phosphonate 
anchor ligands has been reported, which consists of two windmill-shaped [Ti12O13 
(OEt)18(PhenylPO3)3 groups bridged by three ethoxide ligands [50]. Comparison with 
previously reported work suggests that the binding mode of the phosphonate anchor 
is strongly dependent on the structure of the underlying substrate (Figure 10.9).
10.3.1.3  N-Donor Ligands Participating in Titanium Oxo Clusters
Compared to carboxylate and phosphonate ligands, crystalline TiOCs capped by 
N-containing ligands are relatively rare [51]. Mono- and dioximates are versatile 
ligands for the modification of titanium alkoxides. Isostructural Ti6O6(OiPr)6 
(ON=CR2)6 (CR2  =  CMe2 or C5H8) cluster has been isolated and structurally

characterized with the NO groups bridging two titanium atoms, which has the same 
structure as the carboxylate substituted analogs, the [Ti6O6(OR)6(OOCR′)6] clusters 
discussed above [52]. A series of nanosized TiOCs were reported through post-synthetic  
modification of [Ti10O12(CAT)8(py)8](cat = catecholato, py = pyridine) cluster with 
quantitative substitution of labile pyridine ligands (pico, 4-Phpy, and pyrald) [53]. The 
ratio of phenylphosphonic acid with azole nitrogen-containing ligands had a great 
influence on the cluster core nuclearity, in which the increment of the phenylphospho-
nic acid may allow a higher concentration of tetranuclear subunits to form higher 
nuclearity. When 2-aminoisonicotinic acid ligand was employed, an interesting 
nanoscale Ti4-Ti6-Ti4 triple cluster series formed [Ti4(μ3-O)(PPA)3(OiPr)8]2[Ti6 
(μ3-O)2(μ2-O)2(PPA)2(OiPr)10](ANA)2 with a diameter reaching as long as 2.8 nm  
[54]. Through functionalization on conjugated ligands, a high nuclearity Ti28 molecular 
cluster [Ti28(μ4-O)4(μ3-O)20(μ2-O)24(PhenO)14(1,10-phn)14]Cl2·6PhenOH with a 
diameter of 1.6 nm was successfully obtained, in which Ti atoms were connected 
through μ2-O, μ3-O, and μ4-O atoms [55] (Figure 10.10).

10.3.2  Bandgap Engineering of Titanium Oxo Clusters
As known structural and reactivity models of TiO2, TiOCs have potential photocata-
lytic applications due to the synergistic effect of the TiO metal core with the func-
tional ligands. Many strategies have been developed to reduce the optical bandgaps 
of TiOCs, including ligand modification and metal doping. Investigation into the 
bandgap engineering of TiOCs will not only be beneficial for their photocatalytic 
behavior but also can help elucidate the mechanisms of TiO2 modification.

Modification of TiOCs with functional ligands could lead to great alteration and 
complete change of the original properties of TiOCs due to variation in electronic 
communication between the coordinated ligands and the Ti–O metal core. As a 
result, the light absorption properties are modulated, improved, or greatly enhanced. 
Through the labile coordination sites of a robust phosphonate-stabilized Ti6 cluster, 
a variety of Ti6-core-based TiOCs with different carboxylate ligands have been suc-
cessfully synthesized without changing the cluster core [56]. The increasing electron-
withdrawing effect of the organic species can significantly influence the bandgap 
structures of TiOCs and allows systematic bandgap engineering with a narrow range 
of 3.7–3.2 eV, which has been confirmed by absorption spectra studies. A series of 
triphenylamine dyes functionalized TiOCs have been successfully synthesized and 
characterized with regard to crystal structure [57]. As the closest model of dye sensi-
tized solar cells (DSSCs), these TiOCs have been applied to photoelectric conversion 
evaluation by a solar cell device. The synergistic effect of intra-dye molecular charge 
transfer (ICT) and dye to TiOC charge transfer (LMCT) contributes to the power 
conversion efficiency. The photocurrent properties can then be improved by the dye-
TiO pre-anchored structure, in which the TiOC core acts as an efficient anchoring 
moiety (Figure 10.11).
Chromophore ligands (CLs) have also been selected to synthesize Ti6-TiOCs in a sim-
ple and general approach. The bandgap of TiOCs has been tuned at a wide range of 
3.41–1.98 eV by selecting the type and the number of the CLs (catechol, salicylaldox-
ime, 2- hydroxypyridine, and benzoic acid) [58]. The lowest-energy bands of these  
Ti6-TiOCs are attributed to the CL-to-TiO core charge-transfer bands through density 
functional theory calculation, which provides a precise and wide-ranged bandgap tun-
ing method for TiOCs. Catecholate-functionalized TiOCs are known to exhibit low 
bandgaps because of the ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) from H2Cat to the 
high-valence TiOCs, in which the absorption edge of TiOCs has been moved to the NIR 
region, with a bandgap as low as 1.51 eV and endows them with remarkable third-
order NLO properties and potential optical limiting applications [59]. Meanwhile, elec-
tronic structures of the obtained B-TiOCs have been investigated by DFT calculations 
to reveal the origin of their NLO behavior, which reveals that the smaller bandgaps of 
B-TiOCs are beneficial for strengthening the NLO response (Figure 10.12).
10.3.2.2  Metallic Doping
In addition to ligand modification, metal doping has also been developed to modify 
the electronic band structure of TiOCs and improve their photocatalytic

performances. These embedded metal ions result in the incorporation of donor or 
acceptor states between the valance and conduction band, and the introduction of 
additional energy levels. A majority of metal ions have been successfully doped in 
PTCs, which provides a good platform for understanding the relationship between 
the structure and photochemical behavior. In metal doping strategies, the coordina-
tion environments of the applied metal ions show significant influence on their 
visible-light adsorption. The metal-doped PTCs can be divided into three classes 
with regard to the role of dopant metal ions through structural analysis – (i) graft on 
the labile coordination sites of Ti–O metal core; (ii) act as counter ions to stabilize 
TiOCs; (iii) serve as excellent connectors for the assembly engineering of TiOCs into 
multidimensional structures.
Transition-metal ions, doped on the defect site of the metal core, can effectively 
adjust the bandgap of TiOCs. An isostructural series of Ti14M(OEt)28O14(OH)n 
cages, which contain different dopant metal ions, have been successfully obtained, 
in which the bandgaps are within the range of values found previously for transition 
metal-doped TiO2 nanoparticles due to the positions of 3d orbitals of the central 
dopant metal ions [60]. These 3d orbitals of MnII (d5) and FeII (d6) are partially occu-
pied and mixed with the valence bands of the TiO cages, which leads to a small 
reduction in the bandgaps. In comparison, the full-shell d10 configuration of GaIII 
with a lower energy level does not mix with the valence band and has no influence 
on the bandgap. Three benzoic acid-stabilized heterometallic TiOCs with the differ-
ent transition metals Co, Cu, and Cd have been synthesized by a one-step solvother-
mal reaction, which exhibit an enhanced light absorption with optical bandgaps of 
1.76, 2.23, and 2.61 eV [61]. The bandgaps of Co and Cu-doped TiOCs were obvi-
ously reduced compared to that of TiO2 due to O 2p → Ti 3d charge-transfer transi-
tions and MCCT. The doping of Cd and its current coordinated mode did not seem 
conducive to adjusting the bandgap compared with TiO2. The remarkably extended

visible absorption band and the decreased bandgaps further indicated that the 
absorption and bandgap can significantly be adjusted through the transition-metal 
dopant (Figure 10.13).
A series of binary cluster-based crystalline materials [Ti12(μ3-O)14(OiPr)18]·[CuxIy] 
containing TiOCs cations and polynuclear copper halide anions have been pre-
pared [62]. The incorporated copper halides produce strong absorption in the visible 
light range and significantly decrease the bandgaps of the obtained supersalts as 
compared to the bandgap of the undoped Ti12 cluster. Meanwhile, the nuclearity 
and coordination environment of the polynuclear Cu-halide anions and their pack-
ing arrangement have an important impact on their bandgaps. According to the soft 
and hard acid–base theory in coordination chemistry, Cu and Ti ions have affinities 
to nitrogen and oxygen, respectively. Thus, bifunctional N/O-donor ligands are 
selected as organic linkers for the assembly of TiOCs and Cu-halide anions into 
multidimensional materials. Through introduction of four different N/O-donor 
ligands, Ti6O4(OiPr)10(O3P-Phen)2 clusters have been linked with a variety of poly-
nuclear copper halides, including Cu2X2, Cu4X4, and Cu4X4-DABCO-Cu4X4, to form 
1D chain, 2D layer, and 3D diamond framework materials with colorful light 
absorption and various bandgap structures [63]. The bandgaps of these compounds 
are in the moderate values between 2.45 and 2.89 eV, and they present obvious light 
absorption beyond their absorption edges (even after the measurement limit of 
800 nm), which indicates that polymetallic and multidimensional doping have 
proven to be efficient for increasing the solar energy absorption and adjusting band-
gap structures (Figure 10.14).

10.4  ­Structure and Properties of Lanthanide Oxo 
Clusters (LnOCs)
Extensive efforts have been devoted to the rational design and synthesis of lanthanide 
oxo clusters (LnOCs) due to their intriguing structural esthetics and potential mag-
netic, luminescent, or catalytic properties [12]. The assembly of LnOCs depends on 
the degree of lanthanide hydrolysis and the aggregation of the hydroxo intermediates. 
Ligand-controlled hydrolysis and anion template strategies have been developed to 
determine the nuclearity and overall structure of the resulting clusters [64]. Since 
Zheng group first developed a ligand-controlled Ln hydrolysis approach [65], signifi-
cant progress has been made in the synthesis of Ln clusters with distinctly different 
structures ranging from Ln3 to Ln140, which are always assembled from several basic 
polyhedral motifs through edge-sharing or vertex-sharing.
10.4.1  Synthetic Strategy for High-Nuclearity Lanthanide Clusters

low-nuclearity clusters. In the anion template strategy, the absorption of atmos-
pheric CO2, mixed multiple anion templates, and the slow release of anion tem-
plates through in situ ligand decomposition play critical roles in preventing 
precipitation of their lanthanide salts, allowing not only controllable lanthanide 
hydrolysis but also gradual and modular assembly of the giant cluster species.
10.4.1.1  Ligand-Controlled Hydrolysis Approach
As one of the smallest organic carboxylate ligands, acetate has been used as a sup-
porting ligand for cluster assembly. The hydrolysis of Ln(ClO4)3 in the presence of 
acetate leads to the assembly of [Ln104(ClO4)6(CH3COO)56(μ3-OH)168(μ4-O)30 
(H2O)112]·(ClO4)22 (Ln104, Ln = Gd, Nd) clusters [66], which feature a four-shell 
arrangement of the metal atoms with an innermost cube (a Platonic solid) and three 
successively circumscribing Archimedean solids – Ln8@Ln48@Ln24@Ln24. Ancillary 
ligands or the substituent groups of these ligands are known to have important 
effects on the structure of the metal cluster core. When propionate ligands are 
introduced, [(ClO4)@Ln27(μ3-OH)32(CO3)8(CH3CH2COO)20(H2O)40]·(ClO4)12 (Ln27, 
Ln = Gd, Dy) clusters are obtained, which consists of a cage-like core [Gd27(μ3-OH)32 
(CO3)8]33+ protected and stabilized by propionate ligands  [67]. As an important 
O-donor ligands for the construction of high-nuclearity lanthanide clusters, polyal-
cohol ligands derivative N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc) selectively transforms 
into 2-acetamido-2,3-dideoxy-D-erythro-hex-2-enofuranose (Chromogen I) with 
high yields in the presence of lanthanide ions during the assembly of nonanuclear 
lanthanide 
clusters 
Ln9(μ4-O)(μ3-OH)8(LH)4(OAc)4(H2O)12]·5ClO4·24H2O 
(Ln = Gd, Dy, LH3 = Chromogen I, Ln9) [68]. Through hydrogen bonding, the 
cluster complex self-organizes into a nanostructured Ln54 cage-like assembly in 
which six units occupy the vertices of an octahedron (Figure 10.15).
As efficient sensitizers for lanthanides, diketones have also been used as coordi-
nating ligands. Several lanthanide β-diketone Ln5(DBM)10(OH)5 clusters 
(DBM = dibenzoylmethanido; Ln = Nd, Gd, Er, and Yb) have been successfully 
synthesized through metal-controlled assembly, which exhibit typical near-­ 
infrared (NIR) luminescence upon excitation at 350 nm  [69]. What is more, the

10.4  ­Structur e and  Propertie s of  Lanthanide  Ox o Clusters  (LnOCs

cluster nuclearity depends on the identity of the lanthanide ion due to the influ-
ences of a metal ion’s Lewis acidity and the sterics of the Ln–OH unit on the kinetics 
of the assembly process that leads to a particular cluster. Phosphonate moieties are 
interesting functional groups for the construction of molecular cages, as the three 
tetrahedral oxygen atoms mimic well the zeolite building blocks, providing suitable 
anchoring sites for lanthanide centers [70]. A new group of 4f-phosphonate tetranu-
clear clusters have been obtained in the presence of aromatic base and pivalic acid 
as co-ligands, as the base promotes the reaction by deprotonation of the phosphonic 
acid ligand and co-ligands bind competitively with the phosphonate to increase 
solubility. Numerous polynuclear clusters with diverse topologies have been synthe-
sized through a ligand-controlled hydrolysis approach.
10.4.1.2  Anion Template Method
The design and synthesis of high-nuclearity Ln clusters remain challenging due to 
their concentrated positive charges, which are quite unstable in solution. Anion tem-
plate strategy is effective in templating the organization of the recognizable smaller 
metal complex units or building blocks into the final giant clusters. Small-unit anions 
such as halides (X = Cl−, Br−, and I−), NO3
−, ClO4
−, and CO3
2− act as templates to 
induce the formation of clusters and balance the positive charges of the metal ions to 
stabilize the cluster. As anions vary in composition, charge, and/or geometry, varied 
anion templates are expected to form clusters with distinct structures and properties. 
The incorporation of oxoanions as templates could lead to the production of lantha-
nide precipitates prior to the hydrolysis of the lanthanide ions. The slow release of 
anions through in situ ligand decomposition, multiple anions, or mixed anions as tem-
plates and the absorption of atmospheric CO2, are beneficial to the assembly of high-
nuclearity lanthanide clusters due to their dispersive template effect.
10.4.1.3  Slow Release of Anion Templates
The slow release of anions is essential to the assembly of lanthanide clusters, in situ 
ligand decomposition under hydro/solvothermal conditions is one effective approach 
for achieving slow production of anions. The capsule-like clusters [Ln24(DMC)36 
(μ4-CO3)18(μ3-H2O)2] (Ln  =  Gd/Dy, DMC=N,N′-dimethylcarbamic acid 
anion) have been obtained by solvothermal methods using isonicotinic acid, CuO, 
and Ln(NO3)3, in which the DMC and CO3
2− anions were slowly generated via in situ 
decomposition of N,N-Dimethylacetamide [71]. The backbone of the capsule is com-
prised of 2 Gd3 triangles and 3 Gd6 hexagons, possessing 18 tetragons and 8 trigons, 
and each tetragon fastens a μ4-CO3
2− anion by coordination to Gd3+. A unique three-
dimensional lanthanide–zeolite framework assembled from Ln60 nanocages as 
building blocks were reported  [72], in which templating μ6-CO3
2− was generated 
through ligand decomposition and bridge six [Gd4(OH)4] cubanes to form a six-
cubane wheel linked together to result in the formation of a nanocage [Gd60(μ3-
OH)96(μ6-CO3)8] by sharing corners vertex. Among the methods for slowly introducing 
CO3
2− anions, atmospheric CO2 fixation has been widely adopted to generate 
CO3
2− under the proper pH conditions, in which the ­template CO3
2− anions were 
slowly produced to induce the formation of cluster frameworks and prevent the 

10  Metal Oxo Clusters

carbonate precipitation reaction. A giant wheel Gd140 cluster with 10-fold symmetry 
has been obtained by reaction of myo-inositol, acetate, and Gd(ClO4)3 under reflux-
ing through absorption of CO2 from the atmosphere, which consists of 10 Gd14 subu-
nits and possesses an outer diameter of ∼6.0 nm, an inner diameter of ∼3.4 nm, and a 
thickness of ∼1.5 nm [73]. In each Gd14 unit, 14 Gd3+ ions are connected together by 
two central templating CO3
2− ligands and 10 OH− anions. 10 Gd14 units are alter-
nately linked together through 2 μ3-OH ligands and 2 μ2-O atoms from 2 myo-inositol 
ligands to form the gigantic wheel structure of Gd140 (Figure 10.16).
10.4.1.4  Multiple Anion Templates, Including Mixed Templating Anions
A mixed anion template is an effective synthetic method to construct high- 
nuclearity lanthanide clusters with novel structures, in which multiple anions act as 
complementary templates to induce the assembly of the cluster skeletons and dis-
perse the positive charges of metal ions [67]. Multiple anions of different types or 
quantities have been combined and employed to gain a multifunctional template 
effect. Anion templates are the main driving force in the formation of two novel 
nanoscale lanthanide hydroxide clusters Gd38 and Gd48 [74]. What is more, the cage-
like Gd38 can be dynamically converted into the barrel-shaped Gd48 upon stimula-
tion with Cl− and NO3
−. A bi-nanopillar “sandwich” Dy76 cluster formed by the 
fusion of two Dy48 mono-nanopillars has been reported with Cl− and CO3
2− tem-
plates inside the cavities of the bi-nanopillar [75]. The identical “bread” layers and 
wheel-like “bread” layers are composed of Dy19(μ3-OH)40 and [Dy38(μ4-O)10(μ3-OH)58] 
respectively, in which Cl− and CO3
2− templates exist. In comparison, the mono- 
nanopillar Dy48 cluster has also been isolated with simple Cl− templates. Directed by 
the combined set of I− and CO3
2− as templates, stepwise transformation starting from 
Er12 to Er60 by way of two key intermediates Er34 and Er48 has been successfully 
demonstrated [76]. The cluster structure is sensitively dependent on the size match 
between the halide template and the LnIII ion. High-nuclearity LnOCs could be pro-
duced by a rational and stepwise assembly guided by judiciously chosen mixed-anion 
templates, which stimulates more future efforts for the directed and rational synthe-
sis of sophisticated molecules and possibly functional materials (Figure 10.17).

10.4.2  Building Blocks for the Assembly of High-Nuclearity 
Lanthanide Clusters
LOCs featuring cluster-type polyhedral core motifs have been extensively studied in 
terms of their structural esthetics and potential applications in magnetism, optics, 
or catalysis. Structural analyses have revealed that some smaller lanthanide-hydroxo 
core motifs exist independently and clusters with higher degrees of structural 
sophistication can be formally constructed with combinations of these polygonal 
motifs. These motifs mainly include triangular Ln3(μ3-OH) (Ln3), tetrahedral 
cubane-like Ln4(μ3-OH)4 (Ln4), trigonal bipyramidal Ln5(μ3-OH)6 (Ln5), square 
pyramidal Ln5(μ3-OH)4(μ4-O) (Ln5), and octahedral Ln6(μ3-OH)8(μ6-O) (Ln6) 
(Figure 10.18), which have acted as building blocks to form a series of lanthanide 
clusters through edge-sharing, and vertex-sharing.
A series of lanthanide clusters composed of single triangular Ln3(μ3-OH) (Ln3) 
as building blocks has been obtained via edge-sharing, and vertex-sharing, in which 
Ln4, Ln7, Ln12 clusters are some representative examples [77–79]. The tetrahedral 
cubane-like Ln4(μ3-OH)4 (Ln4) is the most common building block cluster and can 
be assembled into a series of Ln clusters, such as wheel-like Ln12, Ln15 clusters, and 
cage-like Ln60 clusters [72, 80]. In comparison, lanthanide clusters assembled by 
Ln5 and Ln6 building blocks are extremely rare. High-nuclearity Ln104 cluster which 
features a Ln8@Ln48@Ln24@Ln24 four-shell arrangement has been assembled from 
square pyramidal Ln5(μ3-OH)4(μ4-O) (Ln5) building block, in which template 
anion plays a key role in the assembly of high-nuclearity lanthanide clusters [66]. In 
addition to single building blocks, mixed building blocks are very common in the 
formation of lanthanide metal clusters. Vertex-sharing the mixed building blocks is 
an effective synthetic strategy to construct lanthanide clusters and significantly 
enriches the structural diversity of the lanthanide clusters. Through the assembly of 
Ln5(μ3-OH)4(μ4-O) (Ln5) building block with Ln6(μ3-OH)8(μ6-O), Ln4(μ3-OH)4, 
Ln3(μ3-OH) building blocks, Ln14 and Ln48 clusters could be obtained, respec-
tively [74, 81] (Figures 10.19, 10.20, and 10.21).

10.5  ­Conclusion and Perspective
In summary, the synthetic and assembly strategies for Zr–O clusters, Ti–O clusters, 
and Ln–O clusters have been summarized. Group III and IV metals with strong 
Lewis acidity favors hydrolysis in the presence of water and leads to the aggregation 
of the hydroxo intermediates. However, such highly unpredictable reactivity is 
“tamed” by the utilization of suitable ligands like carboxylates, sulfates, and poly-
dentate ligands, which leads to the formation of well-defined discrete cluster struc-
tures. Diverse cluster structures are closely related with these metals used due to 
their important intrinsic differences. On the other hand, the nature of ligands such 
as coordination modes and steric hindrance has been crucial in the formation of 
clusters. Additionally, the reaction conditions such as metal ion/ligand ratio, sol-
vents, temperature also influences the structure of cluster formed. What is more, 
various synthetic strategies such as direct synthesis, ligand exchange and anion tem-
plate have been applied to clusters synthesis.
While the synthesis and structure of these clusters have been extensively studied, 
their applications have been mostly focused on function as building blocks to con-
struct metal–organic framework (MOF) materials through linking with various 
organic linkers. A variety of Zr-MOF architectures have been successfully synthe-
sized and explored for potential applications in catalysis and in gas/water adsorp-
tion, due to their superior stability compared to other MOFs. TiOCs are commonly 
photoactive and have potential photocatalytic application due to synergistic effect of 
the TiO metal core with the functional ligands. Correspondingly, TiOCs-based 
MOFs have demonstrated photocatalytic activity in photocatalytic alcohol oxida-
tion, photocatalytic H2 generation, photocatalytic reduction of CO2 and so on. 
LnOCs have attracted increasing attention due to their potential magnetic and lumi-
nescent applications. Additionally, various LnOCs-based MOFs have been reported 
and applied in broad applications, such as light emitting, sensing, catalysis, and

Overall, the precise construction of metal oxo clusters based on Zr, Ti and Ln met-
als has been flourishing and great progresses have been established. However, the 
rational design and synthesis of these metal oxo clusters remain challenging and 
new synthetic methods are needed to promote the development of ZrOCs, TiOCs 
and LnOCs. More investigations on the assembly mechanism and practical applica-
tions are of great importance. Furthermore, theoretical calculations and modeling 
methods for a deeper understanding of relationship between the structure and the 
properties should be investigated, which provide opportunities to optimize the fab-
rication and functionalities of ZrOCs, TiOCs and LnOCs.
