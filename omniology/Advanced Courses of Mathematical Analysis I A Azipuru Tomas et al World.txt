Preface 
An idea, a dream and then a reality. This is the manner we can describe 
the gestation of the First International Course of Mathematical Analysis in 
Andalucia. 
Our small research group, working in the University of Cadiz, considers 
that, nowadays, Andalucia has a remarkable scientific and cultural impor- 
tance as well as an indisputable international presence and this idea should 
take shape in some type of periodic event. 
Our main aims were: 
(i) That the different research groups in Andalucia working on mathe- 
matical analysis should meet each other and collaborate. 
(ii) That the young researchers working in these groups could have access 
to the most advanced research lines. 
Besides, we consider it of great importance to unite efforts in order to 
guarantee a solid education in our young researchers. 
The Course was held in 2002, from September 23 to 27, in the historical 
part of Cadiz, a beautiful city surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean. 
This book is the first volume in a series of advanced courses of Mathe- 
matical Analysis. The authors of this collection are recognized experts with 
an extensive research and educational experience. The authors of the first 
volume are: Yoav Benyamini, Manuel Gonzblez Ortiz, Vladimir Miiller, 
Simedn Reich (co-authored with E. Matouskova and A. J. Zaslavski) and 
Angel Rodriguez Palacios. 
The article by Benyamini is the only updated survey of the exciting and 
active area of the classification of Banach spaces under uniformly continuous 
maps. 
The article by Gonzblez is a pioneer introduction to the theory of local 
duality for Banach Spaces. 
The paper, Genericity in nonexpansive mapping theory, by Eva Ma- 
toubkov6, Simedn Reich and Alexander J. Zaslavski, provides an up-to-date 
detailed overview of the applications of the generic method to nonexpansive 
mapping theory. 
The article by Vladimir Muller provides a survey of results and ideas 
concerning orbits of operators and related notions of weak and polynomial 
orbits. The Scott Brown technique to obtain invariant subspaces is carefully 
exposed. 
The survey paper by Rodriguez Palacios collects the results on absolute- 
valued algebras since the pioneering works of Ostrwski, Mazur, Albert, 

vi 
and Wright to the more recent developments. The celebrated Urbanik- 
Wright paper on the topic is fully reviewed. The survey contains in addition 
some new results, and several new proofs of known results. As a matter of 
fact, it will be the authoritative reference for the optimal version of results 
scattered in the literature through many separate papers. 
We want to express our gratitude to all of them. We also want to thank 
Professors Tomas Dominguez Benavides and Angel Rodriguez Palacios for 
being the first in supporting the.idea of celebrating the Course. 
We thank from the heart every participant for their presence: the ma- 
ture researchers as well as the young ones still in their educational period. 
Of all of them we keep pleasant memories. 
Besides, we want to thank Professor Maria Victoria Velasco for assuming 
the responsibility of organizing the second course in September 2004 in the 
gorgeous city of Granada. 
Finally, we want to thank the publishing house, World Scientific, for 
making possible the interesting contents of our seminars to be enjoyed by 
all the mathematical community.

INTRODUCTION TO THE UNIFORM CLASSIFICATION 
OF BANACH SPACES

This is an introductory survey of the classification of Banach spaces as metric 
spaces, where the maps are (nonlinear) uniformly continuous maps or, more specifi- 
cally, Lipschitz maps. We describe basic results which show that the uniform theory 
and the linear theory are different but that, nevertheless, some linear features of a 
Banach space are preserved under uniform homeomorphisms. 
1. Introduction 
The norm on a Banach space induces on it a topology and a metric. In 
the linear theory of Banach spaces the natural maps are continuous linear 
maps, and these maps “respect” not only the topology but also the metric 
structure: they are bounded, i.e., Lipschitz maps. Of special interest are 
the linear maps which preserve the metric, i.e., isometries. 
One can, however, disregard the linear structure of the Banach spaces 
and consider them as a special class of topological spaces or as a special 
class of metric spaces. In this setup the maps are no longer required to 
be linear and we consider continuous maps in the first case and uniformly 
continuous, Lipschitz or isometric maps in the second. 
The following two theorems define the “natural boundaries” for a mean- 
ingful theory. The first is due to Mazur and Ulam 32 and the second to 
Kadec 26 (for separable Banach spaces) and to Toruliczyk 39 (for general 
density characters). 
Theorem 1.1. Let E and F be Banach spaces. Iff : E -+ F is a surjective 
isometry satisfying f(0) = 0, then f is linear. 
‘This work was supported by the Technion Fund for the Promotion of Research. 

2 
Theorem 1.2. Two infinite-dimensional Banach spaces are homeomorphic 
to each other iff they have the same density character. 
These two theorems say that the topological and isometric classifica- 
tions of Banach spaces are “trivial” in two opposite ways: Theorem 1.1 im- 
plies that the linear structure can be completely recovered from the metric 
structure and thus reduces the (seemingly) nonlinear isometric classifica- 
tion problem to the linear one. Theorem 1.2 says that the topology gives 
no information whatsoever on the linear structure. 
The uniform classification of Banach spaces is lLinbetween” these two 
extreme theories. As we shall see in these notes this is an interesting theory 
which, on the one hand, gives some information on the linear structure of 
the spaces but, on the other hand, it is rich enough to be genuinely different 
from the linear theory. 
A word of warning before we go on. While the topological or nonlin- 
ear isometric theories are “trivial” from the point of view of classification, 
they are certainly far from being trivial. Infinite-dimensional topology is 
a rich theory, see the books by Bessaga and Pekzy6ski lo and van Mill 
40. Similarly, there are, of course, many problems concerning isometric (or, 
more generally, 1-Lipschitz) maps, such as into-isometries, extensions, non- 
expansive retractions, fixed points etc., which we do not consider here at 
all. 
The purpose of this survey is to describe the main results, ideas and 
techniques in the area. The idea is to draw the attention of the reader to 
this exciting area and to stimulate further reading and interest. We did 
not try to give “best” results or to analyze variations of the concepts and 
techniques. For these and for many more topics that are not discussed 
here at all we refer the reader to the recent book 
by the author and J. 
Lindenstrauss. We also refer to for unexplained notation and terminology. 
The article is divided to three sections. The first is a general description 
of the area in the spirit of an expanded colloquium talk. In the other two 
sections we describe in more detail and with proofs, or sketches of proofs, 
some of the main results on the Lipschitz classification (in Section 3) and 
on the uniform classification (in Section 4) of Banach spaces. 
These notes are an expanded version of lectures delivered at the “First 
International Course of Mathematical Analysis in Andalucia” , which was 
held in Cadiz, Spain, in September 2002. It is a pleasure to thank the 
organizers and the participants of the course for the pleasant and inspiring 
atmosphere. I also thank the referee for his useful comments.

2. A General Overview 
Historically, the first result in infinite-dimensional topology is the following 
theorem of Mazur 31. Denote the closed unit ball of Lp(p) by Bp(p). 
Theorem 2.1. Let p and u be two measures and let 1 5 p ,  T < 00. If Lp(p) 
and LT(u) have the same density character, then their unit balls, Bp(p) and 
BT(u), 
are uniformly homeomorphic to each other. 
The homeomorphism of Bp(p) onto BT(p) 
(for the same measure p) is 
given explicitly by the map f -+ 
IflP/'sign(f). 
For different measures we 
first use these maps pass to B2(p) and B2(u) and then note that these balls 
are even isometric to each other. 
Note that the L, spaces are not linearly isomorphic to each other for 
different values of p .  Hence the uniform classification (at least of the unit 
balls of Banach spaces) is different from the linear classification of the 
spaces. We shall see later that L, and L, (for p # q), as well as L, and 1, 
(for p # 2) are also not uniformly homeomorphic to each other. Thus the 
uniform classification of subsets of Banach spaces is also different from the 
uniform classification of the whole spaces. 
The next result, which generalizes Mazur's theorem, was proved for 
spaces with an unconditional basis by Ode11 and Schlumprecht 35 and for 
general lattices by Chaatit 12. For proofs and more details see also Sections 
9.1-9.3 in '. 
Theorem 2.2. Let E be a Banach lattice which does not contain 1,'s 
uniformly. Then its unit ball is uniformly homeomorphic to the unit ball of 
a Halbert space. 
The condition that E does not contain loo's uniformly is, in fact, also nec- 
essary. This was proved much earlier by Enflo 15. 
gave the first example of two Lipschitz 
equivalent Banach spaces which are not isomorphic to each other. It follows 
that the Lipschitz classification of Banach spaces is different from their 
linear classification. 
We now describe the structure of the example. Let q : E -i F be a linear 
quotient map from E onto F with kernel 2. A linear operator T : F -+ E 
is called a lifting of q if qT =  id^. Such a lifting is an isomorphism of F 
into E whose image, T F ,  is complemented in E (by the projection Tq). 
The kernel 2 is complemented in E (by the projection idE - Tq) and E is 
isomorphic to F @ 2. If T is a (nonlinear) Lipschitz lifting, then the same 
Aharoni and Lindenstrauss 

4 
formulas yield similar Lipschitz consequences: F is Lipschitz equivalent to 
a Lipschitz retract of E, the kernel 2 is a Lipschitz retract of E and E is 
Lipschitz equivalent to F @ 2. 
The example of Aharoni and Lindenstrauss is a Banach space E which 
does not contain a subspace isomorphic to @(I?) 
(for some uncountable set 
I?), but such that there is a surjective linear quotient map q : E -+ @(I?) 
with kernel co and such that q admits a Lipschitz lifting. It follows that 
E is Lipschitz equivalent to %(I?) 
@ co = @(r), 
but they are certainly not 
isomorphic to each other: E does not even contain an isomorphic copy of 
Godefroy and Kalton l7 have recently introduced a “categorical” con- 
struction, which, among other things, gave a systematic method of con- 
structing more examples of the same nature. (See also Kalton 27 where 
the approach is extended to spaces of Holder and more general uniformly 
continuous functions.) We now describe the construction in 17. 
Let E be a Banach space and denote by Lipo(E) the Banach space of 
Lipschitz functions f : E -+ R satisfying f ( 0 )  = 0. The norm of f is its 
Lipschitz constant. Let F(E) denote the closed linear subspace of the dual 
Lipo(E)*, spanned by the point evaluations &(f) = f(~). 
The space F(E) 
is called the Lipschitz free space over E. Lipschitz maps between Banach 
spaces induce, in a natural way, linear maps between their free spaces and 
F(E) enjoys some useful properties of free objects in a category. The map 
6~ : E + F(E) is a (nonlinear!) isometry of E into F(E). One checks easily 
that the linear map PE : F(E) + E, given by P ~ ( z a , 6 , ~ )  = Canz,, is 
a surjective quotient map with llP~ll = 1. Clearly 6~ is an isometric lifting 
of PE, hence F(E) is Lipschitz equivalent to 
The next theorem yields the required examples. Recall that a Banach 
space E is weakly compactly generated (WCG) if there is a weakly compact 
subset K c E whose linear span is dense in E. Since the unit ball of a 
reflexive space is weakly compact, reflexive spaces are certainly WCG. 
C O ( F ) .  
@ ker(PE). 
Theorem 2.3. Let E be a nonseparable WCG space. Then F(E) does not 
contain a subspace isomorphic to E. I n  particular F(E), which is Lipschitz 
equivalent to E @ ker(PE), is not isomorphic to it. 
All the examples known to date of Lipschitz equivalent Banach spaces 
which are not isomorphic to each other are nonseparable and nonreflexive. 
The main open problem in this area is 

5 
Problem 2.1. If two separable Banach spaces are Lipschitz equivalent to 
each other, are they necessarily isomorphic? What if they are also reflexive? 
Uniformly convex? 
It turns out that the method used to construct nonseparable examples 
cannot work in the separable case. This is one consequence of the following 
remarkable theorem of Godefroy and Kalton 17. 
Theorem 2.4. Let F be a separable Banach space and assume that it is the 
image of some Banach space E under a surjective quotient map q : E --+ F .  
If q admits a Lipschitz lifting, then it also admits a linear lifting. 
In the linear theory the space Q is considered to be a “small” space. 
For example, it does not contain reflexive subspaces or any of the other 
classical Banach spaces. This is no longer true in the Lipschitz category. 
Aharoni 
proved that it is actually “universal”. The proof of the following 
theorem is presented in Section 3. 
Theorem 2.5. E v e y  separable metric space is Lipschitz equivalent to a 
subset of CO. 
While we do not know whether the Lipschitz and linear classifications 
of separable Banach spaces coincide, the uniform classification is certainly 
different from both. The following result is due to Aharoni and Linden- 
strauss 3, improving on a previous result of R b e  38. For a proof, more 
details and extensions see Section 10.4 in 8 .  
Theorem 2.6. Let 1 I p ,  q,pn < 00 with p, --f p and let E = (C @lpn)q. 
Then E is uniformly homeomorphic to E @ 1,. 
If p # q and p, # p for all 
n, then E and E @ 1, are not isomorphic. If p = 1 and q,p, > 1 for all n, 
then E is reflexive while E @ 11 is not, hence (see Corollary Z.l(i) below) 
they are not even Lipschitz equivalent. 
The results up to this point showed the difference between the uniform 
and the linear classification. We now discuss some results in the opposite 
direction, namely, instances in which at least some of the linear structure 
is preserved. 
The most natural way to “linearize” a mapping is by differentiation. 
Recall that a mapping f : E --t F is said to be Giiteaux differentiable at 
a point 2 if the limit Du = limt+o (f ( x  + tu) - f ( x ) ) / t  exists for every 
u E E and is a bounded linear operator as a function of u. The operator 
D is called the Gdteaux derivative of f at x and is denoted by Of(.). 

6 
If f is a Lipschitz mapping with constant K ,  which is G6teaux differ- 
entiable at some point x, then the derivative D = D f ( x )  is bounded by the 
same constant K .  Moreover, iff is a Lipschitz equivalence (Le., a Lipschitz 
map which also satisfies the lower estimate 11 f (x) - f (y)II 2 (12 - y”/K for 
every x,y E E ) ,  then D is also bounded from below by the same constant, 
and is thus an into-isomorphism. (Note that D f ( x )  is only bounded from 
below. Its image may very well be a proper subspace of F even when f 
was assumed to be a surjective Lipschitz equivalence.) It follows from this 
discussion and from the next theorem that in many cases the existence of 
a Lipschitz embedding of E into F implies that there is also a linear iso- 
morphism of E into F .  (The theorem, due independently to Aronszajn 5 ,  
Christensen l3 and Mankiewicz 30, will be discussed in detail in Section 3.) 
Theorem 2.7. Let E be a separable Banach space and assume F has the 
Radon-Nikodgm property (RNP). I f f  : E t F is a Lipschitzfunction, then 
there is a point x E E where f is G6teaux differentiable. 
It is obvious that some assumption is needed in Theorem 2.7 on the 
space F .  For example, one cannot take F = co because by Theorem 2.5 
every separable Banach space is Lipschitz embedable in CO, but “most” 
Banach spaces are not linearly embedable in it. The assumption that F 
has RNP is actually essential. Indeed, one of the characterizations of RNP 
is that F has RNP iff every Lipschitz map from R to F is differentiable at 
some point of R (or, equivalently, differentiable almost everywhere). Thus 
for the theorem to hold we must assume that F has RNP. 
Since reflexive spaces have RNP we obtain 
Corollary 2.1. (i) If a separable Banach space E is Lipschitz equivalent to 
a subset of a reflexive Banach space F ,  then E is isomorphic to a subspace 
of F .  
(ii) If E is Lipschitz equivalent to a subset of a Halbert space, then it is 
isomorphic to a Hilbert space. 
(iii) If p > 1 and r 2 1, then L, is Lipschitz equivalent to a subset of 
L, iff it is isomorphic to a subspace of L,, i.e., iff r = 2 or 2 2 r 2 p. 
Part (ii) was originally proved by Enflo 16. To deduce it from Theorem 2.7 
we need the fact that E is isomorphic to a Hilbert space iff all its separable 
subspaces are. Part (iii) also holds for p = 1, but this requires an additional 
argument. 

7 
Differentiation results are, of course, not available for general uniformly 
continuous maps. We now describe some of the techniques used in their 
study. More details, including the definition and some basic facts on ultra- 
products, will be given in Section 4. 
A basic useful property of uniformly continuous mappings is that they 
satisfy a Lipschitz condition for large distances. More precisely 
Proposition 2.1. Let f : E -+ 
F be uniformly continuous. Then for every 
a > 0 there is a constant K = K(a) > 0 such that [ l f ( z ) - f ( y ) ( [  5 K[[z-y[( 
whenever (111: - yl[ 2 a. 
One way to apply the proposition is to use it to create Lipschitz maps 
from uniformly continuous ones: Assume that f : E -+ F is uniformly 
continuous and assume, as in the proposition, that I\f(z)-f(y)II 5 KJ[z-yll 
whenever 1111: - yJJ 2 1. Put fn(z) = f(nz)/n. 
Then the map fn satisfies 
Ilfn(z) - fn(y)II I K\Jz - y)) whenever JIz - y\I 2 l/n. It follows that if 
U is a free ultrafilter on N, 
then g = (fn)u is a K-Lipschitz map from the 
ultrapower (E)u into (F)u. Moreover, if f is a uniform homeomorphism, 
then one can apply the same procedure to f-l. One checks directly that 
(fn)-l = (f-l)n, thus the procedure gives a Lipschitz inverse to g .  We 
have thus proved the following theorem of Heinrich and Mankiewicz 21 
Theorem 2.8. If E and F are uniformly homeomorphic, then they have 
Lipschitz equivalent ultrapowers. 
As we shall see in Section 4, this result, together with the results of 
Section 3, combine to give a simple proof of the following theorem of Ftibe 37. 
Roughly speaking, the theorem says that uniformly homeomorphic Banach 
spaces have “the same” finite-dimensional subspaces or, in the language of 
Banach spaces theory, that they have the same local linear structure. 
Theorem 2.9. Let E and F be two uniformly homeomorphic Banach 
spaces. Then they are crudely finitely-representable in each other, i.e., there 

8 
is a constant C > 0 so that for every finite-dimensional subspace El of E 
there is a finite-dimensional subspace Fl c F with d(E1, Fl) 5 C and vice 
versa. 
In particular, since L, and L, do not have the same local structure when 
p # r (as follows, for example, by computing their type and cotype), it 
follows that they are not uniformly homeomorphic to each other. 
Proposition 2.1 can also be applied through the study of approximate 
midpoints. 
Definition 2.1. Fix x,y E E and 6 > 0. Then the set of &approximate 
midpoints between x and y is 
Mid(z,y,b)= { z :  ) ) x - z l I , J ) ~ - z l l  5 ( ~ + ~ ) I I x T Y I I / ~ }  
When 6 = 0 we say that z is a midpoint (or, when we want to emphasize, 
exact midpoint) between x and y. 
It is clear that exact midpoints are mapped by isometries to exact mid- 
points. More generally, if f is K-Lipschitz and two points x and y happen 
to satisfy l)f(x) - f (y))I = KJJx 
-yll, then f maps exact midpoints between 
x and y to exact midpoints between their images. The following proposition 
generalizes this fact. 
Proposition 2.2. Let f : E -+ F be a uniform homeomorphism and let 
0 < 6 < 1/2. Then there are points z, y with 112 - yII arbitrarily large, so 
that 
f(Mid(GY76)) c Mid(f(x), f ( d , 5 6 ) .  
Proof. We only sketch the proof and leave the exact computations, that 
give the estimate 56, to the reader. 
Let K(a) be the Lipschitz constant of f for distances larger than a. 
Then K(a) is a nonincreasing function of a. Put K = lima-,mK(a). 
Since f-l is also uniformly continuous, it follows that K > 0. Fix tu 
so large that K(a/2) N K. Choose x,y with llx - yII > a such that 
(1 f (z) - f (y)(I N K(lx - yII and let z E Mid(x, y, 6). Then 
llf(4 - f (.>I1

Kllx - 41 
5 (1 + W l l x  - Yll/2 
(1 + 6)ll.f (x) - f (Y)11/2.

We now explain the idea of how the approximate midpoint sets can be 
used to show that some Banach spaces E and F cannot be uniformly home- 
omorphic to each other: Compute the approximate midpoint sets for points 
in E and in F. By the proposition a uniform homeomorphism f : E -+ F 
will have to take some approximate midpoint set in E into an approximate 
fked point set in F. If it so happens that approximate midpoints sets in 
E are “large” sets and approximate midpoint sets in F are %mall”, then 
this would contradict the uniform continuity of f-’. To demonstrate how 
this idea is implemented we shall compute in Section 4 the approximate 
midpoint sets in 1, and L,, and then use the right notions of “large” and 
“small” , appropriate for the different situations, to prove 
Theorem 2.10. For every 1 5 p < 03, p # 2, the spaces L, and 1, are not 
uniformly homeomorphic to each other. 
This method was introduced by Enflo (unpublished), who used it to 
prove the case p = 1 of the theorem. The case 1 < p < 2 is due to Bourgain 
l1 and the case p > 2, which required a new notion of “large” and “small” 
is due to Gorelik 19. 
The problem of characterizing Banach spaces which are uniformly home- 
omorphic to a subset of a Hilbert space was completely solved by Aharoni, 
Maurey and Mityagin 4. The result is, in fact, more general and holds 
for linear metric spaces and not only for Banach spaces. For example, it 
follows from the next theorem and from known results in the linear theory 
that L p ( p )  is uniformly homeomorphic to a subset of a Hilbert space iff 
0 5 p 5 2 .  
Theorem 2.11. A real linear metric space is uniformly homeomorphic to 
a subset of a Hilbert space iff it is linearly isomorphic to a subspace of Lo(p) 
for some measure p. 
We shall not discuss this theorem in these notes. The interested reader 
is referred to Chapter 8 in 
The last problem that we discuss in this section is the uniform and 
Lipschitz classification of balls and spheres in Banach spaces. 
Benyamini and Sternfeld 
proved that for every infinite-dimensional 
Banach space E there is a Lipschitz retraction from the unit ball B(E) 
onto the unit sphere S(E). Equivalently, S ( E )  is Lipschitz contractible 
and there is a Lipschitz map on B(E) with no approximate fixed point. 
(The results in 
followed Nowak 34, who proved them for some special 

10 
spaces. See also Azagra and Cepedello-Boiso 
these results and for generalizations to starlike sets.) 
for a smooth version of 
This result leads naturally to the following open problem. 
Problem 2.2. Let E be an infinite-dimensional Banach space, are its unit 
ball B(E) and unit sphere S(E) Lipschitz equivalent? Are they uniformly 
equivalent? 
The problem is open for any Banach space (including Hilbert space!) except 
for one “pathological” counter-example: Gowers and Maurey 2o constructed 
a separable reflexive Banach space, G M ,  which is not isomorphic to any of 
its subspaces. For this space the unit ball cannot be Lipschitz equivalent 
to the unit sphere. Indeed, iff : B -+ S were a Lipschitz equivalence, then 
since the space is separable and reflexive f would be Giiteaux differentiable 
at some point by Theorem 2.7. The derivative, D, would be an isomorphism 
from GM into a proper subspace of itself (as is easy to deduce from the fact 
that the image of f is in the sphere, which “looks” locally like a subspace 
of codimension one). But there is no isomorphism of GM onto a proper 
subspace of itself! 
It is easy to see that for any Banach space E the unit sphere S(E) is 
Lipschitz homogeneous, i.e., for any two points x, y in the sphere there is a 
Lipschitz homeomorphism of the sphere onto itself taking x to y. It follows 
that if the ball and the sphere of E are Lipschitz (or uniformly) equivalent, 
then the ball should also be Lipschitz (or uniformly) homogeneous. The 
only nontrivial advance on Problem 2.2 is the following result of Nahum 33. 
See Section 9.4 in ’ for a proof and further discussion. 
Theorem 2.12. Let E be a Banach space which is isomorphic to E @ R, 
then B(E) is Lipschitz (respectively, uniformly) equivalent to S(E) iff it is 
Lipschitz (respectively, uniformly) homogeneous. 
Here is a simple application of the theorem. 
Corollary 2.2. Let E and F be two Banach spaces which are isomorphic to 
E @ R  and F @ R  respectively. Then the balls B(E) and B(F) are Lipschitz 
(respectively, uniformly) equivalent to each other iff the spheres S(E) and 
S(F) are. 
Proof. It is clear that if f is an equivalence between the spheres, then its 
homogeneous extension gives an equivalence between the balls. Conversely, 
assume that f : B(E) -+ B ( F )  is a Lipschitz (or uniform) equivalence. Iff

takes S(E) onto S(F), then we are done. So assume that there is a point 
z 6 S ( E )  such that Ilf(z)II < 1, and choose a point y E E with llyll < 1 and 
llf(y)ll < 1. (Any point y with llyll < 1 which is close enough to z certainly 
satisfies this condition.) Let g be a Lipschitz homeomorphism of B( F)  onto 
itself which takes f(z) onto f(y). Then f-' o g o f maps the point z in 
S(E) to the point y E E with JJyJJ 
< 1. Since pairs of points in S(E) can be 
mapped to each other by a Lipschitz equivalence of B(E) and the same is 
true for pairs in B(E) \ S(E), it follows that B(E) is homogeneous and the 
same is true for B(F) which is Lipschitz (or uniformly) homeomorphic to it. 
By the theorem B(E) and B ( F )  are Lipschitz (or uniformly) homeomorphic 
to S ( E )  and S ( F )  repectively. Thus all the four sets involved are equivalent 
0 
to each other and, in particular, so are S(E) and S(F). 
3. Lipschitz Maps 
The main result in this section will be the proof of Theorem 2.7 as well as 
some further comments and variations. But we start with a proof, essen- 
tially due to Assouad 6 ,  of Theorem 2.5. 
Proof of Theorem 2.5. A map f : X --t Q is given by a sequence of 
real-valued functions f(z) = (fl(z), 
fi(s), 
...), where the fn's satisfy 
(i) f,(z) -+ 0 for every z E X. 
(ii) The fn's are Lipschitz with a common Lipschitz constant. 
(iii) There is a constant C > 0 so that for every z # y in X there is a 
In the construction we shall use functions of the form (a-d(z, M ) )  for 
suitably chosen sets M C X and constants a. Such functions are Lipschitz 
with constant 1. 
To present the idea of the proof in a somewhat simpler setup, let us first 
assume that X is compact and that its diameter is 1. 
For each n 2 0 let {zy : i 5 m,} be a finite 2-,-net 
in X and put 
f,,i(z) = (2-n+1 - d(z,zy))+. Then (i) and (ii) hold because Ifn,i(z)I 5 
2-n+1 + 0 and Ilfn,i((~ip = 1. To check (iii) fix z # y. Let n satisfy 
2-(n+1) 5 d(z,y) 5 2-n and choose i such that d ( z , ~ 1 + ~ )  
< 2-(n+3). 
Then 
When X is a metric space, then f is a Lipschitz map iff 
And f is a Lipschitz embedding if also 
n such that Ifn(2) - fn(Y)I 2 Cllz - YII. 
+ 
fn+3,i(Z) = 2 -(n+3)+1 - d(z, ..+3) 
> - 2-(n+3)+l - 2-(,+3) == 2-(n-k3) > 
- d(z, y)/8. 

12 
On the other hand 
d(y, 
2 d(z, y) - d(z, xy+3) > d(z, y) - 2-(n+3) 
2 2-(n+l) - 2-("+3) = 3.2-(n+3) 
hence fn+3,i(y) = 0 and (iii) holds with C = 1/8. 
For a general separable metric space X we need to replace the points 
xy by sets. The main difficulty is that we cannot do this with finitely many 
sets for each fixed n and this makes it more difficult to fulfill both conditions 
(i) and (iii) simultaneously. We shall assume that X is a separable Banach 
space. This is possible because every separable metric space is isometric to 
a subset of the Banach space C(0,l). 
Denote the unit ball in X by B. We construct a function F : X 4 co 
with IIFl[m, 
l l F l l ~ i ~  
5 1 so that FIB = 0 and so that 8 5 112 - yII 5 16 
implies that llF(x) - F(y)II 2 112 - yll/l6. Once this is done put FO = F 
and Fn(x) = 2nF(x/2n) for n # 0 in Z. 
We then write co as (Cz 
@Q)O 
and the required embedding is f(x) = (..., F-l(x), 
Fo(x), 
Fl(x), 
...). To 
see that the Fn's satisfy condition (i) notice that for each fixed x we have 
Fn(x) = 0 and also Fn(x) = 0 whenever n satisfies 2n > IIxlI. It 
is clear that all the Fn's, hence also f, are 1-Lipschitz. To check condition 
(iii) fix x # y and choose n such that 8 5 11(x - ~ ) / 2 ~ l l  
5 16. Then 
IIFnk) - Fn(Y)II = 2"11F(x/2") - F(Y/2n)ll 
2 2n[1(x - ~)/2~11/16 
= llx - ~11/16. 
To construct F let {Ai}i>o be a sequence of 1-balls that cover X .  Denote 
the concentric balls with radius 2 by 2Ai (and the ball of radius 2 centered 
at the origin by 2B). Put MO = 2Ao \ 2B and 
Mi = 2Ai \ ( U M j )  \2B = 2Ai \ (U2A.j) \2B 
for i 2 1. 
j < i  
j < i  
Then X \ 2B = u 
Mi and the disjoint sets Mi have the crucial property 
(*) 
Indeed, fix k such that x E Ak. If d(z,Mi) < 1, choose z E Mi with 
I(x - zll < 1. Then z E 2Ak, hence, by the construction of the M's, cannot 
belong to Mj for any j > k. Thus i 5 k. 
Define now F = ( f o , f l ,  ...) : X 
-+ 
co by fi(x) = (1 - d(x,Mi)) . 
Then Ilfillm, I I f i I l ~ i ~  I 
1 and F is well defined because for every x E X 
the condition (*) gives that fi(x) # 0 for finitely many i's only. Clearly 
For every x E X the set {i : d(x, Mi) < 1) is finite.

Finally, fix two points z,y with 8 5 1111: - yII 5 16. We may assume 
that IIzII 2 2. If i is such that x E Mi, then fi(x) = 1. On the other hand 
fi(y) = 0 because d(y,Mi) 2 11z,yll - diam(Mi) 2 8 - 4 > 1. It follows

We now move to the discussion of Theorem 2.7. The proof of the theo- 
rem actually gives more than just one point of Giiteaux differentiability: the 
function is Giiteaux differentiable “almost everywhere”. This requires an 
explanation. There is no “good” measure on infinite-dimensional spaces (as 
the next lemma shows), hence no natural notion of “almost everywhere”. 
The heart of the proof of the theorem is the introduction of a family of 
“negligible” sets in a general separable Banach space. These sets play the 
role that sets of measure zero play in Rn and the theorem then says that the 
function is Giiteaux differentiable on the complement of such a negligible 
set. 
Lemma 3.1. Let E be an infinite-dimensional Banach space and let K be 
a compact subset of E. Then there is a point y E E so that all the translates 
{ K  + t y  : t E R} are pairwise disjoint. I n  particular there is no translation 
invariant a-finite regular Borel measure p on E. 
that fi(z) - fi(y) = 1 2 ((z - y11/16. 
Proof. The linear subspace V spanned by K is a proper subset of E. 
Indeed, it is contained in the a-compact, hence proper (by Baire’s theorem) 
subset UnL, where L is the closed convex symmetric hull of K .  Choose 
y E E \ V .  If ( K  + t y )  n (K + sy) # 0, then there are XI, 
5 2  E K such that 
z1 + t y  = 2 2  + sy, i.e., y = (z1 - z2)/(s - t )  E V ,  a contradiction. 
If p is a regular Borel measure, then there is a compact set K such that 
p ( K )  # 0. Chose y as above for this set K .  Being a-finite p cannot have 
nonzero mass on all the uncountably many disjoint translates of K in the 
0 
direction of y. Thus p is not translation invariant. 
Several different notions of negligible sets have been introduced. Aron- 
szajn, Christensen and Mankiewicz introduced three such notions and an- 
other useful notion, the Gauss null sets, was introduced later by Phelps and 
is, perhaps, the easiest to define. A Borel set A is Gauss null if p(A) = 0 
for every non-degenerate Gaussian measure p on E. (A measure p is a 
non-degenerate Gaussian measure if every functional 0 # x* E Ex has a 
non-degenerate Gaussian distribution with respect to p.) The analysis of 
the structure of negligible sets belongs to the area of infinite-dimensional 
geometric measure theory and leads to many interesting results. (See Chap- 
ter 6 of 
for a systematic presentation of this topic.) It is a deep recent 

14 
result of Csornyei l4 that the two notions introduced by Aronszajn and by 
Mankiewicz as well as the notion of Gauss null sets are actually equivalent 
to each other. 
We shall follow Christensen and will now present what he called “Haar 
null” sets and their basic properties. This notion was introduced again 
much later (under the different name of “shy sets”) in 22 (see also 23). We 
work in separable Banach spaces, but the definition and the basic properties 
of Haar null sets hold in any abelian Polish group. 
Definition 3.1. A Borel subset A of a separable Banach space E is called 
Haar null if there is a regular Borel probability measure p on E such that 
p(A + z) = 0 for all z E E, equivalently, p * X A  = 0. We denote the family 
of Haar null sets by N. 
Note that if E is finite-dimensional, then a set is Haar null iff its 
Lebesgue measure is zero. Indeed, for sets of Lebesgue measure zero 
just take p to be any probability measure equivalent to the Lebesgue 
measure. Conversely if p is a test measure for A as in the definition, 
then JJXA(Z + z)dzdp(z) = J p ( A  + z ) d z  = 0, hence the inner integral 
J x ~ ( z  
+ z ) d z  is zero p-a.e. But this inner integral is identically equal to 
the Lebesgue measure of A. 
The family N is closed under finite unions. Indeed, if pi are test mea- 
sures for {Ai}i5n, then p1 * ... * pn is a test measure for UAi. It is also 
closed under countable unions. To prove this one needs to choose the test 
measures pi so that the infinite convolution p = IIy * pi converges, and 
then p is a test measure for UAi. See Proposition 6.3 in 
for details. It 
follows that Haar null must have empty interior. Indeed, if A is open, then 
E can be covered by a countable number of translates of A. Thus A E N 
would imply that also E E N, 
which is false. 
Proposition 3.1. If A is a Borel set and A $ N, 
then A - A contains a 
neighborhood of 0. 
Proof. Assume not and choose xj $ A - A with IIzjll < 2-j. Let C = 
(0, l}N be the Cantor group (i.e., the group operation is addition modulo 
2 in each coordinate). Put qn = (0, ... 0, 1 , O  ...), where the 1 is in the nth 
position and denote the Haar measure on C by A. Define cp : C --f E by 
cp(d1,62, ..,) = Cbjzj. The condition IIzjll < 2-j implies that the series 
converges and that cp is continuous. Since A $ N, 
it follows that there is a 
point y E E such that X(cp-l(A + y)) # 0. Indeed, otherwise the image of 

15 
X under cp, namely, the measure defined by p ( B )  = X(cp-l(B))) could serve 
as a test measure to show that A is Haar null. 
A classical theorem in measure theory yields that the difference set 
U = cp-l(A + y) - cp-l(A + y) contains a neighborhood of 0 in C, and thus 
vn E U for large enough n. For such n the set cp-'(A+y) contains two points 
that differ only in the nth coordinate, hence xn E (A+ y) - (A+ y) = A-A, 
a contradiction.

Corollary 3.1. Let E be an infinite-dimensional Banach space. Then 
(i) If A is a Borel proper subspace of E, then A E N. 
(ii) If A c E is compact, then A E N. 
Part (i) is obvious, and (ii) follows from the fact that the compact set A-A 
cannot contain an open set. 
Since it is easy to construct, in any separable Banach space, a compact 
set K and a Gaussian measure p such that p ( K )  # 0, it follows from (ii) 
that the notions of Haar null and Gauss null are not equivalent. 
An important property of Haar null sets is that they satisfy a weak 
version of Fubini's theorem. 
Lemma 3.2. Let V be a finite-dimensional subspace of E and denote the 
Lebesgue measure on V by A. 
W e  also use the same notation X for its 
translates to translates of V .  If X(A n {V + y}) = 0 for all y E E, then 
A E N .  
Proof. As a test measure just take any probability measure on V which is 
equivalent to A.

To prove Theorem 2.7 we shall show that there is a Haar null set A such 
that f is GSteaux differentiable on E \ A. As a preparation we first present 
a simple technical lemma and then a slight generalization of the classical 
theorem of Rademacher that a Lipschitz map between finite-dimensional 
spaces is differentiable almost everywhere. 
Lemma 3.3. Let G be a dense additive subgroup of E and let x E E. If 
f : E -+ R is a Lipschitz function such that limt+o (f ( x  + tu) - f (x))/t 
exists for all u E G and is an additive function of u E G, then f is Giteaux 
differentiable at x. I n  particular the set of Gdteaux differentiability points 
off is a Borel set. 

16 
Proof. The functions ht(u) = (f (z + tu) - f (z))/t are Lipschitz with the 
same constant as f. Hence their convergence on the dense set G implies 
that the limit exists everywhere. The additivity of the limit is clear, and 
the homogeneity follows from a change of variable: ht(au) = ah,t(u). 
To see that the set of differentiability points is Borel we choose the dense 
group to be countable and fix any u E G. Put ht(z, u) = (f (z+tu)-f(z)) /t 
and denote the set {(s,t) E Q x Q : Isl,Itl < l/m} by Dm. Then the 
derivative at z o  E E in the direction u exists iff 
zo E nun {z : 
- 
< 1 ~ ~ 1  
n m D, 
and this set is Borel. Since G is countable, the intersection of these sets 
over all u E G is also Borel. The additivity in u E G is also given by a 
countable set of restrictions.

Proposition 3.2. Let F be a Banach space with RNP and let f : R" -+ F 
be a Lipschitz function. Then f is differentiable almost everywhere. 
Proof. Let cp : R" -+ R be a non-negative smooth function with compact 
support such that J cp = 1. Let G be a countable dense additive subgroup 
of R" and for each u E G put $,(z) 
= limt+o (f (z + tu) - f (z))/t. As F 
has the RNP, f is differentiable in the direction of u almost everywhere on 
every line parallel to u, 
hence almost everywhere in R". Moreover, since G 
is countable $,(z) 
exists for almost all z simultaneously for all u E G. It 
remains to show that it is additive as a function of u E G. 
Put g = f * cp, the convolution of f and 9. Then g is smooth and its 
derivative at z applied to u, 
namely D,(z)u = f * D,(z)u, is linear in u. 
On the other hand 
D,(z)u = lim (g(z + tu) - g(z))/t 
t-0 
(The passage from the first line to the second follows by Lebesgue's domi- 
nated convergence theorem.) Combining this formula with the linearity of 
Dg(z) we obtain that cp * ($,+,, 
- $, - $,,) = 0 for all u, 
v E G. Replacing 
cp by cpj(z) = j"cp(jz) and letting j --f 00 gives that $,+, 
- ($, + $,,) = 0 
a.e. for all u,v E G.

Proof of Theorem 2.7: Let Vl c Vz c ... be finite-dimensional subspaces 
of E whose union is dense in E and let D, be the set of all 3: E E such that 

17 
the limit limt,o 
(f (x + t y )  - f (x)) /t exists for every y E V, and is linear 
as a function of y E V,. 
By Proposition 3.2 D, n {V, + y} is a set of full measure in V, + y for 
all y E E, i.e., X((E \ D,) n {V, + y}) = 0 for all y E E. By lemma 3.2 the 
set E \ D, is Haar null for every n, and since N is closed under countable 
unions U ( E  \ D,) E N. On no,, the complement of this negligible set, f 
is Ggteaux differentiable.

We shall also need an analogous theorem on w*-derivatives. Let E 
and F be Banach spaces and let f : E 
--+ 
F* be a Lipschitz map. 
We say that f is w*-differentiable at a point x E E if the w*-limit 
Dj(z)y = w* - lim (f (x + t y )  - f (x)) /t exists for every y E E and if Dj(z) 
is a bounded linear operator from E to F*. Since the norm is w*-lower 
semi-continuous, it follows that the norm of D;(z) is bounded by the Lip- 
schitz constant of f. Unfortunately, even when f is a Lipschitz equivalence 
Dj(z) does not have to be bounded from below, i.e., an into-isomorphism. 
Nevertheless, Heinrich and Mankiewicz 21 proved that it is bounded below 
almost everywhere, i.e., on the complement of a Haar null set. 
Theorem 3.1. Let E be a separable Banach space and let f : E + F* be 
a Lipschitz embedding of E into a dual space. Then f is w*-differentiable 
almost eve rywhere and its derivative is bounded from below almost every- 
where. More precisely, if llx - yII < 11 f (.) 
- f(y)(I < Kl(z - y(( for every 
x, y E E and if b < 1, then for almost every x E E the w*-derivative off 
exists and satisfies llD;(x)uII 1 bllull for every u E E. 
Proof. The proof of the almost everywhere w*-differentiability is similar 
to the proof of Theorem 2.7 and we omit it. 
Instead of proving the almost everywhere lower boundedness we shall 
only indicate why it is true by describing an analogous but simpler setup. 
Assume that f : R + R satisfies 1s - tl < I f(s) - f (t)l 5 Kls - tl for 
every s,t E R and that b < 1. We show that f’, which is known to exist 
almost everywhere, satisfies If’(t)l 2 b almost everywhere. Indeed, put 
A = { t  : I f’(t)l < 6). If X(A) > 0, then A has a density point and we can 
chose, for any E > 0, an interval I = [a, b] such that X(An1) > (l-c)(b-a). 
Since I f‘l is bounded by K we obtain 
b 
b - a 5 I f @ )  
- f (.)I 
= 1s f’(t)l

provided E is small enough. A contradiction. 
The estimates in the proof of the theorem are completely analogous, see 
Theorem 7.9 in 
for details.

As remarked in the introduction, the derivative (or the w*-derivative) 
is only bounded from below. Thus even if f is assumed to be a surjective 
Lipschitz equivalence it does not follow that the derivative, at a point where 
it exists, is necessarily surjective. (A concrete example of such phenomenon 
was given by Ives and Preiss in 24.) The following problem is open 
Problem 3.1. Assume that f : E + F is a surjective Lipschitz equivalence 
and that E and F are separable. Is there a point xo where D l ( x 0 )  is a 
surjective isomorphism? This is unknown even when we add assumptions 
on E and F such as that they are reflexive or uniformly convex or even 
Hilbert spaces. 
There are two natural approaches to this problem, but they both fail: 
(i) A positive answer would follow if f had to be F’rkchet differentiable 
at some point. But this is false. If ?I, : R + R is any Lipschitz equiva- 
lence with $(O) = 0 which is not differentiable at 0, then f(a1, 
a2, ...) = 
($(al),$(a2), ...) is a Lipschitz equivalence of 12 onto itself which is not 
F’r6chet differentiable anywhere. 
(ii) If A E N would imply that f(A) E N, 
then we could apply 
Theorem 2.7 to both f and f-’ and find a point xo such that f is 
Ggteaux differentiable at 20 and f-l is Gdteaux differentiable at f (20). 
It would then follow by the chain rule that the derivatives at these points 
are inverse to each other. But Lindenstrauss, MatouSkov6 and Preiss 29 
(see also Theorem 6.14 in * ) showed that a Lipschitz equivalence does not 
have to take N into itself. (Their article contains, in fact, stronger results 
that yield similar consequences for the other families of negligible sets and 
not only for the family of Haar null sets.) 
It thus seems that differentiation is not sufficient by itself to solve Prob- 
lem 2.1. We shall now combine it with information on projections, which 
will allow us to show that in many cases if two Banach spaces E and F are 
Lipschitz equivalent, then they are isomorphic. 
Theorem 2.7 implies that when two “nice” spaces are Lipschitz equiv- 
alent, then each of them is isomorphic to a subspace of the other. The 
following theorem, due to Heinrich and Mankiewicz 21, will show that un- 
der the additional assumption that E is complemented in E** they actually 
embed as complemented subspaces of each other. This additional assump- 

19 
tion holds (trivially) when E is reflexive, and also when E is a dual space. 
Theorem 3.2. Let E be a separable Banach space which is complemented 
in its second dual and assume that F has RNP. If E and F are Lipschitz 
equivalent, then E is isomorphic to a complemented subspace of F. 
Thus, whenever E and F are such that we can also use the “decomposition 
method” we deduce that the spaces are actually isomorphic. 
Let us recall two cases where the decomposition method can be applied 
and which cover “most” Banach spaces. We shall denote isomorphisms by 
equality signs and assume that E = F @ W and F = E @ V .  
Then 
(i) E and F are isomorphic to their squares. 
E = F @ W =  ( F @ F ) @ W =  F @ ( F @ W )  
= F @ E  
and similarly F = F @ E ,  hence E = F. 
Then 
(ii) There is a 1 5 p < 00 (or p = 0) such that E = (E @.E @ . . . ) p .  
E = ( F  @ W )  @ ( F  @ W )  
CB ... = F @ (W @ F )  CB (W @ F )  ... = F @I3 
and 
F = V @  
E = V @  ( E @  E @  ...) = ( V @  E )  @ ( E @  E @ ...) = F @ E 
and again E = F. 
As an immediate application we obtain that if E is Lipschitz equivalent 
to L p ( p )  for some 1 < p < 03, then they are actually isomorphic. Indeed, 
L p ( p )  is reflexive, hence by Theorem 2.7 E is isomorphic to a subspace of 
Lp(p), and therefore E is also reflexive. It follows from the theorem that E 
and Lp(p) are isomorphic to complemented subspaces of each other. Since 
L p ( p )  satisfies condition (ii) above, the decomposition method applies. 
We shall not prove Theorem 3.2. (For a proof see Corollary 7.7 in ’.) 
We shall only prove the following earlier theorem of Lindenstrauss 28 which 
illustrates how the condition that E is complemented in E** is used. The 
proof of theorem 3.2 is obtained by combining the ideas in the proof this 
theorem with those of the proof of Theorem 2.7. 
Theorem 3.3. Let E be a Banach space and let EO be a closed subspace 
of E such that there is a Lipschitz retraction f : E -+ Eo. Then there is a 
bounded linear operator T : E + E,”” such that T ~ E ~  
= idEo. In particular, 
if Eo is complemented in E,” (by a projection P), then EO is complemented 
in E (by the projection Q = PT).

We shall present a proof due to Pelczyliski 36. We first need some 
information on invariant means. 
Let G be a group. Recall that a functional M E l,(G)* is called a 
(left) invariant mean if it is a nonnegative functional such that M(l) = 1 
and M ( f g )  = M ( f )  for all g E G and f E 1,. 
(We denoted the function 
identically equal to 1 by 1, and fg is the left translation of f by g E G, i.e., 
fg(x) = f(gx).) Note that llMll = 1. 
Proposition 3.3. Every abelian group G admits an invariant mean. 
Proof. We first show that if W is a compact convex subset of a topological 
vector space and if G is an abelian group of continuous affine transforma- 
tions on W ,  then G has a common fixed point in W .  
Choose a point w E W and fix g E G, then any limit point of 
N-l xr gj(w) is fixed by g. Thus the set Fg of fixed points of g, which is 
compact and convex, is nonempty. Since G is abelian Fg is invariant under 
any h E G and hence, by the same argument, h has a fixed point in Fg. It 
follows that the fixed point sets {Fg : g E G} have the finite intersection 
property, hence a nonempty intersection. 
Put now W = {z* E 1,(G)* 
: x* 2. 0 andz*(l) = 1). Then W 
is w*-compact and convex, and G acts on it as aEne transformations by 
translation. Hence G has a fixed point in W ,  namely, a point M such that 
0 
M ( f g )  = f for all g E G. Thus M is an invariant mean. 
We shall need vector-valued invariant means. Let E be a Banach space, 
an operator M : lm(G; E) --t E is called an invariant mean if it is invariant 
under translations, ((Ad(( 
= 1 and M ( f )  = z, where f denotes the element 
in l,(G; E) which is identically equal to x. 
Such vector-valued invariant means do not always exist, even when G 
is abelian, and we may have to pass from E-valued means to means with 
values in the larger space E**: if M I  is a scalar-valued invariant mean on 
G, then an E**-valued invariant mean M is given explicitly by the formula 
(M(f), Y*) = Ml((Y*, f)) for all Y* E E*. 
Proof of Theorem 3.3. Consider EO and E as abelian groups by using 
their additive structure and fix two E:*-valued invariant means: one on 
the Eo-valued bounded functions on the group G = EO and the other on 
the Eo-valued bounded functions on the group G = E. To simplify the 
notation we shall write them as integrals. This is a convenient notation 
that makes it clear what are the fixed variables and what is the variable 

21 
with respect to which we average. No misunderstanding arises since we 
do not use properties of the integral other than linearity and translation 
invariance. 
The first step is to average f in directions parallel to Eo. Put 
Then g : E --f E,** is Lipschitz with the same constant as f ,  it is the identity 
on Eo, and it commutes with Eo-translations: if y E Eo, then 
= d z )  + S(Y) = g(z> + Y 
because the first “integral” is equal, by the invariance of the mean under 
Eo-translations, to JEo ( f ( z  + x) - f ( x ) ) d x  = g(z). 
We now define the operator T : E --f E,* by 
Again T is Lipschitz with the same constant as f .  The fact that g commutes 
with EO translations implies that T is the identity on Eo, and a computation 
similar to the above shows that T(y + z )  = T y  + Tz for all y, z E E.

4. Uniformly Continuous Maps 
Ultrapowers are an important tool in the study of the uniform classification 
of Banach spaces. This was already demonstrated in Theorem 2.8. We start 
with their definition and basic properties. 
Let I be a set. A family U of subsets of I is called a filter if it is closed 
under finite intersections, 0 @ U and B E U whenever A E U and B 2 A. 
An ultrafilter is a maximal filter. An ultrafilter is free if nuA = 0. 
Let X be a topological space, {xi}iE~ c X and U an ultrafilter on I .  
We say that limuzi = x if the set {i : xi E 0 )  belongs to U for every 
open neighborhood 0 of z. If X is a compact Hausdorff space, then every 
{xi} converges with respect to any ultrafilter. (The limit may depend, of 
course, on the ultrafilter.) 
Let {Ei : i E I }  be Banach spaces and let U be a free ultrafilter on I .  Put 
loo(Ei) = {x = (xi) : zi E Ei and IIzlI = sup 11ziII < m}. The ultraproduct 
of the Ei’s (with respect to U) 
is the quotient space (Ei)u = loo(Ei)/N, 
where N is the closed linear subspace {x : limu llzill = 0) of loo(Ei)/N. The 

22 
norm on (Ei)u is given explicitly by llxll = limu IIzill and, by the definition 
of N ,  is independent of the choice of the representing xi’s. When all the 
Ei’s are equal to E we talk of the ultrapower of E and denote it by (E)u. 
We identify E as a subspace of (E)u via the diagonal map x -+ (xi), where 
xi = x for all i E I. 
If Ti : Ei -+ Fi are uniformly bounded linear operators, then they induce 
an operator (Ti)u : (Ei)u -+ (Fi)u by the formula (Ti)u(zi) = (Tixi). 
More 
generally, if fi : Ei 4 Fi are uniformly Lipschitz with sup (1 fi(0)II < 00, 
then ( f i ) ~  
is defined similarly and is also Lipschitz. 
Recall that a Banach space E is said to be finitely-representable in a 
Banach space F if for every E > 0 and every finite-dimensional subspace 
El of E there is a subspace F1 c F with d(E1, F I )  < 1 + E. E is said to 
be crudely finitely-representable in F if there is a constant C such that the 
above holds with 1 + E replaced by C. 
We shall use the following “principle of local reflexivity” for ultrapowers: 
For every Banach space E and for every free ultrafilter U the ultrapower 
(E)u is finitely-representable in E. (This is analogous to the principle of 
local reflexivity that says that for every Banach space E the second dual 
E** is finitely-representable in E.) 
We can now prove 
Corollary 4.1. Assume that the separable Banach spaces E and F are 
uniformly homeomorphic. Then E is isomorphic to a subspace of (F),**. 
Proof. By Theorem 2.8 there is a Lipschitz embedding of E (which is a 
subspace of (E)u) into (F)u. Considering the latter as a subspace of its 
second dual (F);*, Theorem 3.1 implies that E is isomorphic to a subspace 
of (F);*. 
0 
Note that the constants of the isomorphism are the same as the Lipschitz 
constants of the equivalence given in Theorem 2.8, and that these constants 
depend only on the moduli of continuity of the uniform homeomorphism 
and of its inverse. 
Proof of Theorem 2.9. Let f : E --f F be the uniform homeomorphism 
and fix a finite-dimensional subspace El of E. A standard back and forth 
argument yields separable subspaces El c g c E and F^ c F such that 
f(E) 
= F^: define inductively Fj = spanf(Ej) and Ej+l = spanf-lFj, and 
then take 
and F^ to be the closures of U E j  and U F j  respectively. We can 
thus assume that E and F were separable to start with. 

23 
By the corollary there is an isomorphism T : E -+ (F);*, with a con- 
stant which depends only on f. Fix C > IlTll //T-'Il. By local reflexivity 
(between (F);* and ( F ) u  and between (F)u and F )  there is an F1 c F

We now turn to applications of approximate midpoint sets and we first 
need to compute them in the various spaces. By translation we may do 
the computation for the approximate midpoints between two points of the 
form x and -x. 
Lemma 4.1. (i) Let 1 5 p < 00 and let 0 # x E 1,. 
Then there is a finite- 
dimensional subspace EO c 1, and a finite-codimensional subspace El c 1, 
such that 
1 
-61/pIIxIIB(E1) c Mid(x, -x,6) c Eo + (3p6)1/PllxllB(1,). 
2 
with d ( F l , T ( E l ) )  as small as we wish, hence d(E1,Fl) < C. 
(aa) Let 0 # x E L1. Then there is an infinite sequence {xj} of exact 
metric midpoints between x and -x with 11xi - xjll = 11x11 for i # j .  
(iii) Let 2 < p < 00, and let 0 # x E L,. 
Then there is a constant C, 
depending only on p ,  and a subspace F1 of L, of infinite codimension such 
that 
Mid(x, -x,6) c F1 + C61/2((x((B(Lp). 
Proof. By normalization we may assume that IIxlI = 1. 
(i) Assume first that x is finitely supported, and choose N so that 
x E EO = span{ej : j 5 N } .  Put El = span{ej : j > N } .  
If y E G1/PB(E1), then llxfyll = (IIxllP+ IlyllP)l/p 5 (1+6)l/P 5 1+6, 
i.e., y E Mid(%, -x,6). 
For the other inclusion, assume that y satisfies 112 f 
yI( 5 1 + 6. Write 
y = zo + z1, where zi E Ei, 
and chose a sign 0 = f l  so that llx + 0zoII 2 1. 
Then 
(1 + 6IP L llx + @/(IP 
= ((z + BZOI(P + ( ( 2 1  ((P L 1 + (IZl(lP. 
Hence llzlll 5 ( ( 1  + 6 ) P  - 1)"' 
5 (2pb)'lP for 6 < 6(p). 
If the support of x is not finite, we use the argument above for a finitely 
supported vector which approximates x (where the degree of approximation 
depends only on 6). 
(ii) Inductively divide the interval [0,1] to 2j disjoint subsets {Ai,j : 
i 5 2j} such that Ai,j = Azi-l,j+l U A2i,j+1 and such that JAi,j 
1x1 = 2-j. 
Then define zj(t) = (--l)zx(t) for t E Ai,j and i = 1,. . . ,2j. 

24 
(iii) We only prove the case z = 1. The general case is similar but 
requires some more technical details. 
Let F 2  be the span of the Rademacher functions. By Khintchine’s in- 
equality there is a constant A, such that ApllyllP I 
((yI(2 for every y € F2. 
Take F1 to be the closed subspace of L, orthogonal to span{ 1, F2}, i.e., 
z(t)(l + y(t))dt = 0 for every y E F2 } 
F1 = z E L, : 
{ 
J 
Fix z E Mid(%, -x, 6) and write it as z = a + xi + x2 where xi E Fi. 
Assume, as we may, that a 2 0. Then 
1 + 6 2 111 + Zll, 2 111 + zllz = l((1 + a) + 2 1  + 52112 2 1 + a 
hence a 5 6. By the same inequality 11x2112 I 
1 + 6 < 2, hence 
1 + 6 2 II(1 + a) + 2 1  + 22112 2 111 + 22112 
= (1 + 11x211~)1/2 2 1 + Ilx2ll;/8 2 1 + A ~ l l ~ 2 l l ~ / 8

Thus dist(z, F1) I ]la + x2ll I 6 + (86/A,)

We are now ready to sketch the proof of Theorem 2.10. We refer to 
for details and for the proof for 1 < p < 2 which we do 
Theorem 10.13 in 
not discuss here. 
Proof of Theorem 2.10 for p = 1. Assume that f : L1 -+ I1 is a sur- 
jective uniform homeomorphism. Then f-’ satisfies a Lipschitz condition 
for large distances and we choose a constant K so that JIy - zll 2 1 implies 
By Lemma 4.1 the set Mid(%, -x, 0) is a “large” subset of L1 for every 
x E L1: it contains an infinite IIxlI-separated set. We now apply Proposition 
2.2. After translating the points to x and -x and assuming, as we may, 
that llxll 2 1, we obtain for this x that this large set is supposed to be 
mapped by f into Mid(f(z),f(-z),G), which is a “small” set in 11: it 
is a finite-dimensional perturbation of a set of small diameter. But this 
is impossible. Indeed, compactness of bounded sets in finite-dimensional 
spaces would then imply that the images of two of the IIxlI-separated points 
y, z E Mid(x, -x,O) would satisfy llf(y) - f(z)ll - 6llxll - 
and for small 6 
0 
Proof of Theorem 2.10 for p > 2. This case requires a new way to 
measure “large” and “small” sets. We first give a heuristic formulation 
K-lIly - 41 I 
Ilf(y) - f(z)ll. Fix 6 > 0. 
this would contradict llf(y) - f(z)ll 2 K-llly - zll = K-lIIx((.

of the so called "Gorelik principle", which uses a mixture of topological 
and metric conditions to compare the "size", and use it to give a heuristic 
argument for the case p > 2. We then formulate a precise quantitative 
version of the principle and apply it to give a precise proof. 
The Gorelik principle: A uniform homeomorphism between two Ba- 
nach spaces cannot take a large ball in a subspace of finite codimension in 
one space into a small neighborhood of a subspace of infinite codimension 
in the other. 
Assume now that f : 1, -+ L, is a surjective uniform homeomorphism. 
By Lemma 4.1 and Proposition 2.2 f should map a Sl/p((zl(-ball in a sub- 
space El of finite codimension in 1, into a 61/211z11-neighborhood of an 
infinite-codimensional subspace F1 of L,. 
But this would contradict the 
Gorelik principle because p > 2 implies that for small S the radius of the 
ball, bl/PIIzII, is much larger then the size, S 1 ~ 2 ~ ~ z ~ ~ ,  
of the neighborhood. 
We now give the precise formulation of Gorelik's theorem 19. 
Theorem 4.1. Let E and F be Banach spaces, and assume that 'p : E -+ F 
is a homeomorphism with a uniformly continuous inverse 'p-l. Assume 
that El c E is a subspace of finite codimension and Fl c F a subspace of 
infinite codimension. If a, P > 0 satisfy 
(*) 
then the modulus of continuity of 'p-l satisfies w,-i(2P) 2 a/4. 
q(aB(E1)) c F1 + PB(F) = {z E F : dist(z, F1) I P }  
To deduce the case p > 2 of Theorem 2.10 we use the fact that f-' 
satisfies a Lipschitz condition for large distances to choose K > 0 so that 
t 2 1 implies w f - l ( t )  5 Kt. Fix S > 0 and use Proposition 2.2 and Lemma 
4.1 to choose z with 261/211z11 2 1 so that f maps a 61/pIlzll-ball in a 
subspace El of finite codimension in I ,  into a 61/211zll-neighborhood of an 
infinite-codimensional subspace Fl of L,. Theorem 4.1 with a = S1/p((z(( 
and P = 61/211z11 then gives 
w f - l ( 2 6 1 ~ 2 ~ ~ z ~ ~ )  
2 6 1 ~ q x ~ ~ / 4  
= f51/p-1/2 . N2 
llxll/4 
But wf-l (261/211z11) I K.261/211z11 by the choice of K ,  and this is impossible 
Proof of Theorem 4.1. The proof will follow from two facts: 
(i) There is a compact set A c ;B(E) such that whenever f : A -+ E 
is a continuous function satisfying 11 f (z) - 211 1. a/4 for every z E A, then 
f(A) n Ei # 0. 
for small enough 6 (because p > 2).

Indeed, by a theorem of Bartle and Graves (see Proposition 1.19(ii) in 
) there is a (nonlinear) continuous right-inverse + : E/E1 -+ E to the 
quotient map IT : E 4 E/E1 so that + maps ?B(E/El) into $B(E). The 
set A = +(FB(E/E1)) is compact because E/E1 is finite-dimensional, 
If f : A 4 E satisfies Ilf(z) - 211 I a/4 for every z E A, then the map 
g(y) = y - ~ f ( + ( y ) )  maps %-B(E/E1) into itself because ~$J(yv) = y, 
1 1 1 ~ 1 1  = 1 and $(y) E A yield 
By Brouwer's fixed point theorem g has a fixed point yo, and it follows that 
Tf(+(YO)) = 0, i.e.1 f(G(Y0)) E f ( A )  n El. 
(ii) Let B be a compact subset of F .  Then there is a point y E F with 
IIyyII < 2P and dist(B + y, FI) > P. 
Indeed, let B1 be a finite PIZdense set in B. The subspace G spanned 
by F1 and B1 is a proper subspace of F (because F1 has infinite codimen- 
sion), hence there is a point y E F with llyll < 2P and dist(y,G) > 3p/2. 
Given z E B ,  choose z1 E B1 with llz - zlll < P / 2 .  If z E F1, then 
z1 - z E GI hence JIz + y - zll 2 dist(y, G) - llz - z111 > p. 
To prove the theorem, find a compact set A C ;B(E) as in (i). Then 
use (ii) for the compact set B = cp(A), and find y E F with llyll < 2,B for 
which dist(cp(A) + y, F1) > P. 
The map f ( z )  = cp-'((p(s) + y) maps A into E, and if we had 
w,-1(2p) < a/4, then f would satisfy 
Ilf(z) - zll = Ilv-l(cp(4 + Y) - cp-'(cp(4)II 
I 
W,-1(IIYII> 
5 W,-1(2P) < 4 4  
for every z E A. By (i) there is an zo E A with f(z0) E El. In fact 
~ ( x o )  
E aB(E1) because I l f ( ~ o ) l l  I Ilf(zo) - zoll + llzoll < 3 a / 4  < a. 
Condition (*) then implies that cp(zo) + y = cp(f(z0)) E FI + PB(F), 
We finish by quoting three results on spaces whose linear structure is 
uniquely determined, or is determined up to finitely many possibilities, by 
their metric structure. The proofs use the techniques of this section as well 
as quite deep results in the linear theory of Banach spaces. Parts (i) and 
(iii) are due to Johnson, Lindenstrauss and Schechtman 2 5 ,  part (ii) is due 
to Godefroy, Kalton and Lancien 18.

Theorem 4.2. (i) Let 1 < p < 00. If E is uniformly homeomorphic t o  I,, 
then it is isomorphic to it. 
(ii) If E is Lipschitz equivalent t o  Q, then it is isomorphic t o  it. 
(iii) For every n there is a Banach space whose uniform class contains 
exactly 2n different linear structures. More precisely, there are 2n mutu- 
ally nonisomorphic Banach spaces El, ..., En, which are uniformly homeo- 
morphic to each other, and so that any Banach space which is uniformly 
homeomorphic to them is isomorphic t o  one of the Ei 's. 
It is unknown whether the analog of (i) also holds for L, (when p # 2). 
In other words, it is unknown whether a Banach space which is uniformly 
homeomorphic to L, is necessarily isomorphic to it. It is also unknown 
whether (i) holds for 11. In fact, it is not even known whether a Banach 
space which is Lipschitz equivalent to 11 is necessarily isomorphic to it. (The 
point is that it is unknown whether a space which is Lipschitz equivalent to 
a dual space is necessarily isomorphic to a dual space. If E is a dual space 
which is Lipschitz equivalent to 11, then it is isomorphic to it by Theorem 
3.2 and the decomposition method.) 
It is unknown whether part (ii) holds for spaces which are uniformly 
homeomorphic to CO. 
In part (iii) one can take El = T ( p l )  @ ... @ T ( P n ) ,  where T ( p )  is the 
pconvexified Tsirelson space, and 1 < p l ,  ...,pn < 00 are different from 
each other. The 2" mutually nonisomorphic but uniformly homeomorphic 
spaces are El @ ( CjEJ 
@ l p j ) ,  where J is an any subset of (1, ..., n } .  
It is not known how to construct a space with k different linear struc- 
tures when k is not a power of 2. 
For proofs see also * Theorem 10.15 (for (i)), Theorem 10.17 (for (ii)) 
and Proposition 10.40 (for (iii)).

AN INTRODUCTION TO LOCAL DUALITY 
FOR BANACH SPACES *

We present an introduction to the study of the local dual spaces of a Banach 
space. We describe with detail the main properties of this concept and give several 
characterizations. These characterizations allow us to show examples of local dual 
spaces for many classical spaces of sequences or functions. 
Introduction. 
A (closed) subspace 2 of the dual of a Banach space X is a local dual 
of X if for every couple of finite dimensional subspaces F of X* and G of 
X, and every 0 < E < 1, there is an operator L : F - 
Z satisfying: 
(a) (1 - E)Ilfll 5 IlLfll I (1 + E)Ilfll, Yf E F ;  
(b) Wf,4 = (f,4, Yx E G, Yf E F ;  
(c) L ( f )  = f, b'f E F n 2. 
A trivial example is given by 2 = X*. 
The PRINCIPLE OF LOCAL REFLEXIVITY (P.L.R., FOR SHORT) gives a 
nontrivial example. This principle can be stated by saying that X, 
as a 
subspace of the second dual X**, is a local dual of X*. 
One reason to study local dual spaces of X is that in many cases X* is 
a big space and for we do not have a good representation of X*. 
In this paper we present an introduction to the study of local dual 
spaces of Banach spaces. Our aim is to help to understand this concept.

So from the beginning we have explained with some detail the meaning 
of the conditions that appear in the definition of local dual. We have 
included many examples of local dual spaces, some of them elementary, 
and some other that could be interesting because they are far more simple 
that the whole dual space. We have also given several characterizations 
of the subspaces of X* which are local duals of X and some other results 
which provide additional properties or techniques to find examples of local 
duals. 
We have tried to write the paper in such a way that could be read 
by people that have attended a course of functional analysis. We have 
included some proofs that are not too complicated and help to understand 
the concept of local dual. Since many of these proofs need the concept of 
convergence over an ultrafilter, we have included at the end of the paper 
a short appendix describing this concept. This should be enough to follow 
the proofs. 
Our material is organized into eight short sections plus an appendix. 
In the first section we analyze the properties that define the concept of 
local dual space. The second section contain a characterization in terms 
of finite dimensional subspaces, which is a weakening of the definition of 
local dual, and some characterizations of “global” type, in which only the 
whole spaces appear. These global characterizations are easier to deal with 
than the definition. However there is a disadvantage: the second dual X** 
appears in the statements. In the third section we show that being a local 
dual is a symmetric relation: 2 is a local dual of X if and only if 2 has 
a local dud isometric to X .  Later in the paper we will apply many times 
this property and the characterizations given in Section 2 to find examples 
of local dual spaces. 
In Section 4 we give some natural examples: C[0,1] is a local dual of 
L1[0,1] and the Bore1 measures on [0,1] which are absolutely continuous 
with respect to the Lebesgue measure form a local dual of C[O, 11 isometric 
to L1[0,1]. We also give some examples of local duals for the spaces e,(X) 
and &(X) of vector sequences and for the spaces C(K,X), L1(pL, X) and 
L,(p,X) 
of vector-valued functions. In Section 5 we show local duals 
for spaces with a basis. Section 6 contains some additional properties of 
local dual spaces. Every separable space admits a separable local dual and 
some spaces admit a smallest local dual. We have included these properties 
so late in the paper in order to have at our disposal examples to illustrate 
them. Section 7 contains local dual spaces for projective and injective tensor 

33 
products of Banach spaces. Note that the spaces C ( K , X )  and L1(p,X) 
are tensor products 5 .  
In the eighth section we introduce the concept of ultrapower of Ba- 
nach spaces. The P.L.R. for ultrapowers, due to Heinrich 15, give us an 
interesting example of local dual. Moreover, we give characterizations of 
the subspaces of X *  which are local duals of X in terms of ultrapowers. 
Finally we give an appendix on ultrafilters. It contain the definition of con- 
vergence over an ultrafilter and the fact that the ultrafilters in a compact 
set converge. This result is an essential tool in the previous sections. 
Throughout the paper we use standard notations: X and Y are Banach 
spaces, Bx the closed unit ball of X ,  and X *  the dual space of X .  Subspaces 
are always closed. We identify X with a subspace of X**. 
For A c X we consider the set 
. , z) = 0 for every z E A}. 
A I : = { f ~ X * . ( f  
Analogously, for C c X *  we define the set C_L of X .  We denote by B ( X ,  Y )  
the space of all (bounded linear) operators from X into Y ,  and by K ( X ,  Y )  
the subspace of all compact operators. Given T E B(X, Y ) ,  N ( T )  and R(T) 
are the kernel and the range of T ,  and T* is the conjugate operator of T. 
We denote by W the set of all positive integers. 
WARNING: Sometimes we say that some concrete space Z is a local dual 
of X without specifying the position of Z inside X .  In these cases it should 
be clear to what copy of Z we are referring to. A simple example is C[O, 11 
is a local dual of L1[0,1]. A not so simple example: L1[0,1] is a local dual 
of C[O, 11. For the latter case see Example 3. 
The concept of local dual space has been introduced recently 11, but 
there are some related concepts that have been previously studied by many 
authors. It would have been difficult to acknowledge all the relations with 
previous results. So we have mentioned some of them throughout the paper 
and we mention here some of the authors that have studied these properties: 
Jerry Johnson 16, Stefan Heinrich 15, Nigel Kalton 18, Gilles Godefroy 7, 
Asvald Lima l9 and Santiago Diaz '. 
Many of the results we present here are joint work of Antonio Martinez- 
Abej6n and the author in '' '' l2 13. 
I am grateful to Antonio Aizpuru and Fernando Le6n-Saavedra for their 
invitation and for their effort to create a pleasant atmosphere for all the 
people which attended the first international course of mathematical anal- 
ysis in Andalucia.

1. Basic properties 
Here we study the properties of the local dual spaces of a Banach space 
which are a direct consequence of the definition. 
Definition 1. A subspace 2 of the dual of a Banach space X is a local 
dual of X if for every couple of finite dimensional subspaces F of X* and 
G of X and every 0 < E < 1, there is an operator L : F - 
2 satisfying 
(a) (1 - &)llfll 5 IlLfll I (1 + &)llfll, Yf E F ;  
(b) ( L f , z )  = (f,z), 
Yx E G, Vf E F ;  
(c) L ( f )  = f, Vf E F n 2. 
Clearly the dual space X *  is a local dual of X. 
Example 1. PRINCIPLE OF LOCAL REFLEXIVITY (I7): x as a subspace 
of X**, 
is a local dual of X * .  
For a short enlightening proof of the P.L.R. see 2o 
Remark 2. Let 2 be a local dual of X. 
(1) Property (a) says that X* is finitely represented in 2: the isomet- 
ric properties of each finite dimensional subspace F of X* are arbi- 
trarily close to the isometric properties of some finite dimensional 
subspaces L(F) of X .  
( 2 )  Property (b) says that L preserves the duality when we pass from 
the pair (G, F )  to the pair (G, L(F)). 
(3) The meaning of property (c) is more difficult to grasp. It says that 
the operators L fix points of 2, 
and it is related with the fact that 
2
'
 
is complemented in X**. 
See Theorem 5. 
Exercise 1. Let 2 be a local dual of X. 
(1) The subspace 2 is norming. This means that for every z E X ,  
II4I = SUP{I(Z, .)I 
: z E 2; llzll = 1). 
(2) Let z** E 2'. 
Then 
llz** - 211 2 llzll for all z E X .  
Clearly, X* is the only local dual of X when X is reflexive. Moreover, 
this can also be true for some non-reflexive spaces. 

35 
Exercise 2. Apply part (2) of Exercise 1 to show that C1 is the only local 
dual of q,. 
NOTES AND REMARKS 
(1) Being a local dual of X is an isometric property and depends on the 
position of 2 inside X*. It is not preserved under renormings of X. 
(2) Two local dual spaces for a Banach space can be very different from 
an isomorphic point of view. Indeed, for the space el the copy of 
Q inside loo is a local dual of X ,  and also each predual of el is 
isometric to a subspace of loo which is a local dual of C1. However, 
there are preduals of C1 which do not contain subspaces isomorphic 
to CO. See Bourgain’s spaces in ’. 
2. Some characterizations 
Here we give some characterizations of the subspaces of X* which are local 
dual spaces of X .  These characterizations are useful to understand the 
concept of local dual. 
The first characterization should be compared with the definition. Here 
we replace the “exact” conditions (b) and (c) by the “approximate” con- 
ditions (b’) and (c’). As we shall see, this is very useful to simplify some 
arguments. 
Theorem 3. (Local Characterization) A subspace Z of X* is a local dual 
of X if and only if for every couple of finite dimensional subspaces F of 
X* and G of X ,  and e v e y  0 < E < 1, there is an operator L : F - 
2 
satisfying 
PROOF. 
A direct proof can be done using an argument similar to the one 
in part (b) of Proposition 2 in 13. For an indirect argument we refer to the 
0 
proof of Theorem 2.5 in ll. 
Example 2. We can apply Theorem 3 to show directly that co is a local 
dual of .!?I.

CLAIM: There exists an integer n such that Pn satisfies the properties of 
the map L associated to F ,  G and E in Theorem 3. 
Indeed, taking into account that the unit ball of a finite dimensional 
space is compact, (a) follows from (l), (b’) follows from (2) and (c’) follows 
from (3). 
Although the definition of local dual space is “local”, we shall see in 
Theorem 5 that it is possible to give “global” characterizations. The fol- 
lowing result will be useful. 
Proposition 4. Let 2 be a local dual of X .  Then every compact operator 
T : 2 
--+ Y admits a compact extension T : X* 
--+ Y with I]?]] 
= IlTll. 
PROOF. Let A be the set of all the pairs CY = (F, G) of finite dimensional 
subspaces F c X *  and G c X .  For each CY = (F, G) E A, we denote by L, 
the map from F into 2 associated to F ,  G and 6 = (dim E, + dim Fa)-’ 
in the definition of local dual. 
Note that for every f in the unit ball of F and every CY E A, TLaf is 
contained in the compact set 2T(Bz). Thus taking an ultrafilter U on A 
refining the filter associated to the inclusion, we can define T : X *  4 Y as 
in Remark 29 
T f  := lim TL,f. 
Ol-U 
It is enough to check that this operator satisfies the required conditions. 0 
Exercise 3. Complete the proof of Proposition 4. 
Let Y be a subspace of X. An operator x : Y* - 
X* is an extension 
The operator x is an isometric extension operator if IIx f I( = l l f l l  for 
operator if (xf)IY = f for every f E Y*. 
Observe that 11 f 11 5 Ilxfll. 
every f E Y*. 

37 
Exercise 4. Let Y be a subspace of X and let J : Y + X denote the 
embedding of Y into X .  
Show that an operator x : Y* - 
X *  is an extension operator if and 
only if J * x  is the identity on Y*. 
In this case, xJ* is a projection from X *  onto x(Y*). 
In the following result we give “global” characterizations of the prop- 
erty of being a dual local. These characterizations are easier to deal with 
than the definition. However there is a disadvantage: the second dual X** 
appears in the statements. 
Theorem 5. (Global characterizations) For a subspace Z of X * ,  the fol- 
lowing statements are equivalent: 
(1) Z is a local dual of X .  
(2) there is an isometric extension operator x : Z* - 
X** so that 
(3) there exists a norm-one projection P : X** - 
X** such that 
(4) there exists a norm-one projection Q : X*** - 
X*** such that 
R(X) 3 x; 
N ( P )  = Z* and R(P) 2 X ;  
R(Q) = 2’’ and N(Q) c X I .  
PROOF. Let L : 2 
-+ X *  denote the inclusion. 
(1) =+ (2) 
For every finite dimensional subspace H of Z* we consider the quotient 
map qH : 2 -+ Z/H*. By Proposition 4 there exists an extension QH : 
Since ( q H ) *  is the embedding of H into Z*, X H  := (QH)* : H 4 X** is 
an isometric extension operator. Indeed, llx~ll = ((qh(( = 1. Moreover, let 
h E H and z E 2. 
X *  -+ Z/HL of QH with 1 1 Q ~ l l  = 114Hll. 
(XHh 1 2) = (h 
1 Q H Z )  = (h 1 q H z )  = ( (qH)*h 
> 2) = (h z). 
Now we take a nontrivial ultrafilter V on the set of all finite dimensional 
subspaces of H of Z* refining the filter associated to the inclusion. Since 
Bx.. is weak*-compactl we can define a map x : Z* -+ X** by 
x := weak*- lim X H .  
H-V 
Clearly x is an isometric extension operator. It remains to check that 
Let x E X .  Then L*X E Z* and for each f E X * ,  
X(Z*) 3 x. 

38 
Thus x satisfies the required conditions. 
(2) 
(3) Let x be the operator given in (2). The kernel of the conjugate 
operator L* : X** + Z* is ZL, and L*X is the identity on Z*. 
Therefore 
XL* is a norm-one projection on X**, N(xL*) = N(L*) = ZL and R(xL*) = 
R(X) 3 x. 
(3) + (4) Take Q = P*. 
(4) 
(1) It is essentially an application of the principle of local reflex- 
ivity to Z c Z** = 2". We refer to the proof of Theorem 2.5 in '' for 
details. 
0 
Remark 6. Recall that X is a local dual of X *  by the P.L.R. In this case 
the decomposition given by the projection in the third part of Theorem 5 
is 
x*** 
= X * @ X L ,  
and the projection P on X*** is just the operator restriction to X .  
Remark 7. The range of the projection P which appears in part (3) of 
Theorem 5 is weak*-dense because R(P) 3 X .  Therefore, in the nontrivial 
case Z # X *  there is no subspace M of X *  such that R(P) = M I .  
NOTES AND REMARKS 
If in the definition of local dual we delete property (c), then we obtain 
the concept of finite dual representability (f.d.r.) studied in lo. There are 
examples of Banach spaces X and subspaces Z of X *  such that X *  is f.d.r. 
in 2, 
but 2 is not a local dual of X .  Note that clearly 21 c 2 2  and X *  
f.d.r. in 21 implies X* f.d.r. in 22. However, 2
'
 
is complemented when Z 
is a local dual, and 2: complemented does not imply 2; complemented. 
See Example 2.11 in 
3. Symmetry 
Here we shall show that being a local dual space is a symmetric property in 
some sense. This fact is a useful tool to find examples of local dual spaces 
for some concrete Banach spaces, as we shall see throughout the paper. 
Let Z be a local dual of X. Let L : Z -+ X* and J : X -+ X** be the 
embedding maps. We introduce the map 
T = L * J :  X -+ 
Z*. 

39 
Since Z is norming (Remark 1)] T is an isometry. 
Theorem 8. Let Z be a local dual of X. Then T(X) is a local dual of Z 
isometric to X. 
PROOF. 
Let x : Z* - 
X** be an isometric extension operator such that 
R(x) 3 X .  Then L*X is the identity on Z* and XL* is a projection on X** 
with R(xL*) 
= R(x) 3 J(X). Therefore, for every x E XI xTz = XL*JX 
= 
Jx . 
CLAIM: The map $J : T(X)* --+ Z** defined by

4. Some natural examples 
The theorem of representation of Riesz (Theorem 6.19 in 2') allows us to 
identify the dual space of the space C[O, 11 of the continuous functions on the 
unit interval [O, 11 with the space M[O, 11 of all the Bore1 measures on [0,1]. 
More precisely, for each F E C[O, 1]* there exists a meamre p~ E M[O, 11 
so that 
for every g E C[O, 11. Moreover, the map F 4 p~ is a bijective isometry. 
By the Radon-Nikodym theorem (Theorem 6.10 in 21)1 every p E M[O, 11 
can be decomposed into two parts p = pa + ps1 where pa and p, are abso- 
lutely continuous and singular, respectively, with respect to the Lebesgue 
measure on [0,1]. Moreover] JJpJJ 
= IIpaJJ

and there exists a function 
f E L1[0,1] such that dpa = f dt and \\pall = IJflll. 

40 
In this way we obtain a decomposition 
M[O, 11 3 -Wzc[O, 11 el Msing[O, 11 
Example 3. M,,[O, 11 is a local dual of C[O, 11 isometric to L1[0,1]. 
PROOF. 
Along this proof we identify M,,[O, 11 and L1[0,1].

For every integer n we consider the partition of [0,1] given by the inter-

converges to X in the weak*-topology and ))G,XII 4 IlXll, for 
every X E M[O, 11. 
Finally we proceed as in the proof of Example 2.

Remark 9. It is possible to give an alternative proof of the fact that 
M,,[O, 11 is a local dual of C[O, 11 taking limits with respect to an ultrafilter. 
We define the map 
x: M,,[O, 1]* = L,[O, 11 - 
M[O, 1]* 
by x h := weak*- lim G; h. 
Clearly llxll 5 1. So it is enough to show that x is an extension operator

satisfying R(x) 3 C[O, 11. 
(x h, f )  = lim(G: h, f )  = lim(h, G, f )  = (h, f). 
Thus x h is an extension of h. 

41 
Let g E C[O, 11 and p E M[O, 11. 
Hence x g  = g and R(x) 3 C[O, 11.

Example 4. C[O, 11 c L,[O, 11 is a local dual of Li[O, 11. 
PROOF. 
We have just seen that M,,[O, I] e L1[0,1] is a local dual of C[O, 11. 
Thus applying Theorem 8, it is enough to show that T(C[O, 11) is the copy 
of C[O, 11 in L,[O, 11. 
Let L : L1[0, 11 = M,,[O, 11 -+ M[O, 11 and J : C[O, 11 -+ C[O, 1]** be the 
Let g E C[O, 11. For every f E L1[0,1] 
inclusion maps. Recall that T = L*J.

(L*JS, f) = Jd (L*Jg)(t)f(t)dt 
and 
(L*JS,f) = ( J g ,  L f )  = (Lf79) = 
g(t)f(t)dt. 
0 
I' 
Thus (L*Jg)(t) = g ( t )  a.e. Hence L* J g  = g. 
Remark 10. Both spaces L1[0,1] and C[O, 11 admit a separable local dual, 
although their dual spaces are nonseparable. We will see later that this is 
a consequence of a general result: Each separable Banach space admits a 
separable local dual. 
Example 5. 
(1) l , ( X * )  is a local dual of l,(X). 
(2) & ( X )  is a local dual of el@*). 
First case: For every couple a := (E, F )  of finite dimensional subspaces 
of ll(X*) and l,(X**), we select a pair of sequences of finite dimensional 
subspaces (En) in X *  and (F,) in X** so that E c ll(En) and F c l,(Fn). 
We denote la1 := dim(E) + dim(F). 
The principIe of local reflexivity allows us to find, for every n, an [a[-'- 
isometry SE : Fn - 
X so that (S z f ,e) = (e,f) for every e E En and 
f E F,, and S;(f) = f for every f E F, n X .  We consider the map 
S" : F -+ l,(X) given by S"(zn) := (Sz(Zn)). 

42 
Let U be an ultrafilter in the set of all couples a = ( E , F )  of finite 
dimensional subspaces E of l l ( X * )  and F of l,(X**) refining the order 
filter. We define an operator A : l,(X**) - 
l,(X)** by 
A(a,) :=weak*- lim S0(tn). 
Note that A is an isometry and A(y,) = (y,) for every (y,) 
E l,(X**). 
Therefore, A is an isometric extension operator. Moreover, A((zn)) = (z,)~ 
if (z,) 
E C,(X). 
In particular A(l,(X**)) 2 l,(X).

Second case: Observe that the operator T : l,(X) - 
l,(X*)* intro- 
The first part of the previous example is particularly useful because the 
dual space of & ( X )  is a "big" space and does not admit a good represen- 
tation. This is also the case for the spaces considered in the next example. 
Example 6. (See 
and 12) Let p be a finite measure. 
duced in Section 3, is the natural inclusion. 
(1) L l ( p , X * )  is a local dual of Lm(p,X). 
(2) L,(p, X * )  is a local dual of L1(p, X ) .  
NOTES AND REMARKS 
From 
it follows 
M[O, 11" = Mac[O, 111 @, 
MsingI0, 111 
However, this fact does not allow us to apply Theorem 5 to derive that 
Ma,[O, 11 is a local dual of C[O, 11. Indeed, Msing[O, 11' 
does not contain 
C[O1 11. 
5. Spaces with a basis 
Recall that a sequence (en) in a Banach space X is a (Schauder) basis of 
X if for every z E X there is a unique sequence (a,) of scalars so that 
x = C z l  aiei. 
Let (e,) be a basis of X .  The projections P, : X 
-+ 
X defined by 
P,(CeO 
a.e.) 
z a := Cy=l aiei are continuous. 
The basis (en) is monotone if llPnll = 1 for every n. 

43 
The linear functionals e: defined by e:(x& aiei) = a, are continuous. 
We denote by [e;] the closed subspace of X *  generated by {e; n E W}. 
Theorem 11. Let X be a Banach space with a monotone Schauder basis 
(e,). Then [e:] is a local dual of X .  
PROOF. Let U be an ultrafilter on W. Since the unit ball of X** is weak*- 
compact, we can define a map P on X** by 
Pz :=weak*- lim P;*z, 
z E X**. 
n+U 
Note that PnPk = PkP, = P, for n 5 k. Thus P,**P = PP;* = P, for 
every n. Since each P, is a norm one projection, P is a norm one projection 
on X**. 
Also it is clear that R(P) II X .  
Now N(P) c N(P,) for every n. Thus N ( P )  c nr="=,N(P;*). But 
the sequence of subspaces (R(P,*)) is increasing and U&R(P,*) is dense in 
0 
[e:]. Therefore [e:]' 
= n&N(P,**) c N(P ).  Thus [e:]l = N(P). 
The following example is similar to those provided by Theorem 11. 
Example 7. The subspace 2 of Lm[O, 11 generated by the characteristic 
functions xn,i of the dyadic intervals 
is a local dual of L1[0,1]. 
To prove it we consider the sequence (P,) of projections defined by 
2n 
Pnf := C(2nXn,i, 
f ) X n , i ,  
i=l 
and repeat the argument in the proof of Theorem 11. We refer to l1 for 
more details. 
It is not difficult to show that this subspace 2 is isometric to the space 
C(A) of the continuous functions on the Cantor set A in [0,1]. 
NOTES AND REMARKS 
It was proved by Casazza and Kalton 
that a separable Banach space 
X has the M.A.P. if and only if we can find a commuting approximating 
sequence in X ;  i.e., a sequence of finite rank operators T, acting on X so 
that

(b) 
lim llTnll = 1 and 
n-co 
TnTk = TkTn = Tmin{k,n); 
(c) 
Using this fact we can prove the following result. 
Theorem 12. (Theorem 2.15 in 11) Let X be a separable Banach space 
with the M.A.P., and let (T,) be a commuting 1-approximating sequence on 
X .  Then U,"==, R(T,*) is a local dual of X and has the M.A.P. 
Remark 13. Let X be a space with a monotone basis. Then the projec- 
tions Pn : X + X form a commuting 1-approximating sequence on X. 
6. Further properties 
The first result in this section extends Theorem 11. It is essentially a special 
case of Lemma 111.4.3 in 14. Its proof in l4 is based in some ideas contained 
in ". 
Theorem 14. Every separable Banach space admits a separable local dual 
space. 
The space L1[0,1] does not admit a smallest local dual; i.e., there exists 
no local dual z d  contained in every local dual of L1 [o, 11. 
Indeed, we have seen in the previous section that L1[0,1] admits two 
local dual spaces C[O, 11 and C(A). These subspaces of L,[O, 11 have empty 
intersections. 
Here we shall see that this cannot happen to spaces that contain no 
copies of C,. 
Theorem 15. If X contains no copies of el, then it admits a smallest local 
dual. 
For dual spaces we have a similar result, which is an application of 
Proposition v.1 in 7. 
Proposition 16. (Proposition 2.22 in 11) Suppose that X is isometric to a 
dual space. Then X admits a smallest local dual z d  if and only if it admits 
a smallest normang subspace 2,. I n  this case z d  = Zn, and this space is 
the unique isometric predual of X .  
NOTES AND REMARKS 
Let dens(X) stand for the density characterof X, defined as the smallest 
cardinal K for which X has a dense subset of cardinality K .

The following result gives an extension of Theorem 14. It is essentially 
a special case of Lemma 111.4.4 in 14. 
Proposition 17. Every subspace L of X* is contained in a local dual ZL 
of X with dens(2L) = max{dens(l), dens(X)}. 
7. Tensor products 
Here we describe some local dual spaces of injective or projective tensor 
products of Banach spaces. For information on tensor products of Banach 
spaces we refer to 5 .  
Let X and Y be Banach spaces. Let B(X; Y) denote the vector space of 
all bilinear maps on X x Y and let B(X; Y)* denote the space of all linear 
functionals on B ( X ;  Y). 
For each pair z E X and y E Y we define z @ y E B(X; Y)* by 
(z @ y , A) := A(x, y). 
Definition 18. The tensor product X @ Y of the spaces X and Y is the 
subspace of B(X; Y)* generated by {z @ y : z E X, y E Y}. 
From the norms on X and Y we can derive many norms on X @ Y. The 
most popular ones are the projective norm 11 . llT and the injective norm 
Let a E X@Y. Observe that the representation a = zl@yl+. . *+zn@yn 
We define the projective norm 1) . \ I T  on X @ Y by 
II . Ile. 
is not unique in general, e.g., (x + y) @ z = z z + y @ z. 
Definition 19. The projective tensor product X&Y of X and Y is the 
completion of (X 
Y ,  11 . l l T ) .  
We can identify (XG,,Y)* with the space B(X, Y*) of all the operators 
from X into Y* by defining 
( T , z @ d  = (Tz,y). 
In the previous section we considered the M.A.P. for separable Banach 
spaces. In general, we say that a Banach space X has the M.A.P if for 
every E > 0 and every compact set K in X, 
there is a finite rank operator 
T on X such that llTll 5 1 and IITz - 211 5 E for every x E K .  

46 
Most of the classical Banach spaces have the M.A.P.; for example, the 
space L1(p) of integrable functions with respect to a finite measure p, the 
space C ( K )  of continuous functions on a compact space K and its respective 
dual spaces have the M.A.P. 
The following result is proved using some ideas of 16. 
Theorem 20. Suppose that Y* has the M.A.P. Then the subspace 
K ( X , Y * )  of the compact operators in B ( X , Y * )  is a local dual of X G j , Y .  
PROOF. Since Y* has the M.A.P. there exists a net (A,) of finite rank 
operators on Y* with IIA,II 
5 1, so that lim, llA,g - 911 = 0 for every 
g E Y*. Note that (by compactness) we can assume that (A,) is weak*- 
convergent in K( Y *) **. 
Now, given T E B ( X , Y * )  and @ E Ic(X,Y*)*, the expression 
( @ T ,  A) := (a, AT) 
defines @T E K(Y*)*. Thus we can define A : K ( X ,  Y*)* - 
B ( X ,  Y*)* 
by 
(A@, T )  := lim(@, A,T) = lim(A,, @ T ) .  
a 
Q 
Note that for every f @ g E X *  @ Y* we have 
(A@, f G3 9) = l i d @ ,  Aa(9) . f) = (@, f @ 9). 
a 
So A is an isometric extension operator. Analogously, we can check that 
for every z 8 y E X&,Y c B(X,Y*)*, we have 
A(. @ Y I K ( X , Y * )  ) = 5 @ Y. 
Thus XG,Y c A ( K ( X ,  Y*)*), 
and it is enough to apply Theorem 5.

NOTES AND REMARKS 
We can define injective tensor product X & Y  of X and Y as the com- 
pletion of ( X  @ Y ,  
11 . / I E ) ,  and obtain some results similar to those given 
for projective tensor products. 
We observe that the description of (X&Y)* is more complicated. It 
can be identified with the space Z ( X ,  Y*) of all the integral operators from 
X into Y* with its natural norm.

Moreover, we can identify the space L l ( p ,  X )  of vector-valued integrable 
functions with X&L1 (p) and the space C(K, X )  of continuous vector Val- 
ued functions with X & C ( K )  5 .  From these facts, taking into account that 

47 
L1(p)* and L,(p) are C ( K )  spaces and that C(K)* is a &(p) space, we 
obtain additional examples. 
8. Ultrapowers of Banach spaces 
The ultrapowers of Banach spaces allow us to deal with some properties of 
a Banach space X defined in terms of finite dimensional subspaces, i.e., the 
local properties. Many times a local property of X corresponds to a global 
property of an ultrapower XU of X with respect to some ultrafilter U. 
We 
refer to l5 for a good survey on ultrapowers of Banach spaces. See also '. 
Here we consider the ultrapowers of Banach spaces to give new examples 
of local dual spaces and to present some characterizations of the subspaces 
of X* which are local dual spaces of X .  
We saw in part (a) of Remark 2 that X* is finitely represented in each 
local dual 2 of X .  This is equivalent to say that there exists an ultrapower 
ZU of Z such that X* is isometric to a subspace of ZU. 
In order to define the ultrapowers of Banach space we fix an infinite set 
I and a nontrivial ultrafilter U on I .  We refer to the Appendix for some 
basic information on ultrafilters. 
Let X be a Banach space. We denote by l,(I,X) the set of all the 
bounded families (xi)iE~ 
in X .  The space l,(I,X) 
endowed with the 
supremum norm 
is a Banach space.

It is not difficult to see that 
N u ( X )  := {(xi) E &,(I, X )  : lim llzill = 0)

U)

PROOF. It is proved in lo that N (  (Tu)*) is f.d.r. in N (  (T*)u).

of f.d.r. The proof of the present result is similar. 
9. Appendix: Ultrafilters 
Here we will see a short introduction to the theory of ultrafilters which 
could be useful to read the previous sections. For additional information 
we refer to or l5. 
The ultrafilters are a tool that allows us to get a limit for some families 
of elements of a compact set. Each of these families have adherent points, 
and the ultrafilter selects one adherent point for each family in such a way 
that the linearity and some other properties of the limit are preserved. 
Let I be a nonempty set. A filter 3 on I is a non-empty family of 
subsets of I satisfying 
(1) A,B E 7 + A n  B E 3. 
( 2 )  A E 3 , A  c B c I + B E F. 
Definition 26. An ultrafilter U o n  I is a filter on I which is maximal with 
respect to ordering by containment. That is, 
3 filter on I and U c 3 implies 3 = U .  
An ultrafilter on U on I is said to be nontrivial if it contains no finite 
subsets of I . 
We can define the convergence with respect to an ultrafilter as follows. 
Definition 27. Let U be an ultrafilter on a set I and let K be a topological 
space. We say that a family (ICi)iE1 c K converges over U to k E K if for 
every neighborhood W of k ,  
{ Z E I :  kiEW} EU. 

50 
In this case we write Ic = 1imi-U Ici. 
The property of the ultrafilters which is the most useful for us is given 
in the following result. 
Theorem 28. Let K be a compact Hausdorff space and let U be an ultra- 
filter on I .  
For each family (ki)iEl c K ,  the limit 1imi-u ki exists in K .  
Finally let us give a detailed description of an application of Theorem 
28 which appears several times in the paper.

The aim of this paper is to give a survey of results and ideas concerning orbits 
of operators and related notions of weak and polynomial orbits. These concepts 
are closely related to the invariant subspace/subset problem. Most of the proofs 
are not given in full details, we rather try to indicate the basic ideas. The central 
problems in the field are also formulated.

1. Introduction 
Denote by B ( X )  the algebra of all bounded linear operators acting on a 
complex Banach space X .  Let T E B ( X ) .  By an orbit of T we mean 
a sequence {Tnx : n = 0,1, , . . } where x E X is a fixed vector. 
The concept of orbits comes from the theory of dynamical systems. In 
the context of operator theory the notion was first used by Rolewicz [30]. 
Orbits of operators are closely connected with the local spectral theory, the 
theory of semigroups of operators [26], and especially, with the invariant 
subspace problem, see e.g. [4]. 
The invariant subspace problem is the most important open problem of 
operator theory. Recall that a subset M c X is invariant with respect to an 
operator T E B ( X )  if T M  c M .  The set M is nontrivial if (0) # M # X.

Problem 1.1. (invariant subspace problem) Let T be an operator on a 
Hilbert space H of dimension 2 2. Does there exist a nontrivial closed 
subspace invariant with respect to T? 
It is easy to see that the problem has sense only for separable infinite- 
dimensional spaces. Indeed, if H is nonseparable and x E H any nonzero 
vector, then the vectors x, T x ,  T2x,. . . span a nontrivial closed subspace 
invariant with respect to T. 
If dim H < 00, then T has at least one eigenvalue and the corresponding 
eigenvector generates an invariant subspace of dimension 1. Note that the 
existence of eigenvalues is equivalent to the fundamental theorem of algebra 
that each nonconstant complex polynomial has a root. Thus the invariant 
subspace problem is nontrivial even for finite-dimensional spaces. 
Examples of Banach space operators without nontrivial closed invariant 
subspaces were given by Enflo [8], Beauzamy [3] and Read [28]. Read [29] 
also gave an example of an operator T with a stronger property that T has 
no nontrivial closed invariant subset. 
It is not known whether such an operator exists on a Hilbert space. This 
“invariant subset problem” may be easier than Problem 1 .l. 
Problem 1.2. (invariant subset problem) Let T be an operator on a 
Hilbert space H .  Does there exist a nontrivial closed subset invariant with 
respect to T? 
Both Problems 1.1 and 1.2 are also open for operators on reflexive Ba- 
nach spaces. More generally, the following problem is open: 
Problem 1.3. Let T be an operator on a Banach space X .  Does T* have 
a nontrivial closed invariant subset/subspace? 
It is easy to see that an operator T E B ( X )  has no nontrivial closed 
invariant subspace if and only if all orbits corresponding to nonzero vectors 
span all the space X (i.e., each nonzero vector is cyclic). 
Similarly, T E B(X) has no nontrivial closed invariant subset if and 
only if all orbits corresponding to nonzero vectors are dense, i.e., all nonzero 
vectors are hypercyclic. 
Thus orbits provide the basic information about the structure of an 
operator. 

55 
Typically, the behaviour of an orbit {Tnz : n = 0,1,. . . } depends much 
on the initial vector x E X. An operator can have some orbits very regular 
and other orbits extremely irregular. 
Example 1.4. Let H be a separable Hilbert space with an orthonormal 
basis {eo, el,. . . }. Let S be the backward shift, i.e., S is defined by Seo = 0 
and Sei = ei-l 
(i) there is a dense subset MI c H such that IIT"z1I -+ 0 
(ii) there is a dense subset M2 c H such that llTnzll 4 00 
(iii) there is a residual subset M3 c H such that the set { P z  : n = 0,1,. . . } 
is dense in H for all z E M3. 
(i 2 1). Consider the operator T = 2s. Then: 
(z E M I ) ;  
(x E Mz); 
As the set MI it is possible to take the set of all finite linear combinations 
of the basis vectors ei. Properties (ii) and (iii) follow from general results 
that will be discussed in the subsequent sections. 
The paper is organized as follows. In the following section we study 
regular orbits. Of particular interest are the orbits satisfying I(Tnzll 4 00. 
It is easy to see that if an operator T has such an orbit, then it has a 
nontrivial closed invariant subset {Tnz : n = 0,1,. . . }-. 
In the third section we study the other extreme - 
hypercyclic vectors, 
i.e., the vectors with very irregular orbits. 
In the subsequent sections we study weak and polynomial orbits. A 
weak orbit of T is a sequence {(Tnrc, 
rc*) : n = 0,1,. . . } and a polynomial 
orbit of T is a set of the form {p(T)a: : p polynomial}, where z E X and 
x* E x*. 
Polynomial orbits are closely related with the notions of capacity and 
local capacity of an operator. These concepts are studied in Section 6. 
In the last section we discuss the Scott Brown technique which is the 
most efficient method of constructing invariant subspaces of operators. On 
an illustrative example we show the basic ideas of the method, which are 
closely connected with orbits. 
For simplicity we consider only complex Banach spaces. However, some 
results concerning orbits remain true also for real Banach spaces. In par- 
ticular, all results based on the Baire category theorem remain unchanged 
for real Banach spaces. 
Although the invariant subspace problem is usually formulated for com- 
plex Hilbert spaces, the corresponding question for real spaces (of dimen- 

56 
sion 2 3) is also open; it is very easy to find an operator on a 2-dimensional 
real Hilbert space without nontrivial invariant subspaces. 
2. Regular orbits 
Let X be a complex Banach space and let T E B ( X ) .  If T is power bounded 
(i.e., sup, llTnll < 00) then all orbits are bounded. The converse follows 
from the Banach-Steinhaus theorem. 
Theorem 2.1. Let T E B ( X ) .  Then T is power bounded if and only if 
sup, llTnxll < 00 for all x E X .  
A more precise statement is given by the following theorem. Recall that 
a subset M c X is called residual if its complement X \ M is of the first 
category. Equivalently, M is residual if and only if it contains a dense G6 
subset. 
Theorem 2.2. Let T E B ( X )  and let (a,) be a sequence of positive num- 
bers such that 
a, = 0. Then the set of all points x E X with the 
property that llTnxll 2 a,llTnll for infinitely many n is residual. 
Proof. The statement is trivial if T is nilpotent. In the following we 
assume that Tn # 0 for all n. 
For k E N set 
h f k  = { x  E x : there exists n 2 k such that IIT"x[I > a,llTn(l}. 
Clearly Mk is an open set. We prove that Mk is dense. Let x E x and 
E > 0. Choose n 2 k such that 
< 1. There exists z E X of norm one 
such that llTnzll > u,E-~IIT~~~. 
Then 
and so either llTn(z + E Z ) I I  > a,lITnll 
or llT"(x - E Z ) ~ )  > u,llTnll. Thus 
either z + EZ E Mk or z - EZ E Mk, and therefore dist {z, Mk} 5 E. Since 
x and E were arbitrary, the set Mk is dense. 
k f k  is a dense 
G6 set, hence it is residual. Clearly each z E 
Mk satisfies llT"x11 2 
0 
Denote by r(T) = max{IXI : X E a(T)} the spectral radius of an 
operator T E B ( X ) .  By the spectral radius formula we have T(T) = 
limn+co (IT n II l / n  = inf, IITn(ll/n. Recall that r(Tn) = (r(T))" for all 
n. 
By the Baire category theorem, the intersection 
u,llTnll for infinitely many n. 

57 
For z E X let r,(T) denote the local spectral radius defined by r,(T) = 
limsup, jo3 IIT"II1/" (the limit limn+o3 IIT"zlI1ln in general does not exist). 
The local spectral radius plays an important role in the local spectral theory. 
Note that the resolvent z H ( z  - T)-l = c,"==, 
$& is analytic on the set 
{ z  : IzI > r(T)}. Similarly, the local resolvent z H (z-T)-lz = C:=, 
can be analytically extended to the set { z  : IzI > r,(T)}. 
It is easy to see that r,(T) 5 r(T) for all z E X. 
Corollary 2.3. cf. [31] Let T E B ( X ) .  Then the set {z E X : r,(T) = 
r(T)} is residual. 
Proof. Let a, = n-l. By Theorem 2.2, there is a residual subset M c X 
such that for each z E M we have llTnzll 2 n-lIITnll for infinitely many 
n. Thus 
for all z E M .  
0 
As we have seen, it is relatively easy to construct vectors x such that 
infinitely many powers Tnx are large. It is much more difficult to construct 
orbits such that all powers Tnz are large in the norm. The result (and 
many other results concerning orbits) is based on the spectral theory and 
therefore it is valid only for complex spaces. For real Banach spaces see 
Remark 2.14. 
Denote by ae(T) the essential spectrum of T E B ( X ) ,  i.e., the spectrum 
of p(T) in the Calkin algebra B ( X ) / K ( X ) ,  where K ( X )  is the ideal of all 
compact operators on X and p : B ( X )  - 
B ( X ) / K ( X )  is the canonical 
projection. Equivalently, ae(T) = {A E C : T - X is not Fredholm}. Let 
re(T) denote the essential spectral radius, re(T) = max{IXI : X E ae(T)}. 
If X is an infinite dimensional Banach space and T E B ( X )  then ae(T) 
is a nonempty compact subset of a(T). Moreover, the difference a(T) \ 
a,(T) is equal to the union of some bounded components of C \ ae(T) 
and of at most countably many isolated points. In particular, if X E a(T) 
belongs to the unbounded component of C \ ae(T) then X is an isolated 
point of the spectrum a(T), it is an eigenvalue of finite multiplicity and the 
corresponding spectral subspace is finite dimensional. 
Denote further by ane(T) the essential approximate point spectrum of 
T ,  i.e., a,,(T) is the set of all complex numbers X such that 
inf{ l l ( ~  
- ~ ) z l l  
: z E M ,  IIzlI = I} = o 

58 
for every subspace M c X with codimM < 00. 
It is easy to see that X $ aTe(T) if and only if dimKer (T - A) < 00 
and T - X has closed range, i.e., if T - A is upper semi-Fredholm. It is 
known [14] that aTe(T) contains the topological boundary of the essential 
spectrum a,(T). In particular, one(T) is a nonempty compact subset of 
the complex plane for each operator T on an infinite dimensional Banach 
space X. 
The elements of the essential approximate point spectrum a,,(T) are 
very useful for the study of orbits. For each X E aTe(T) 
there are "approx- 
imate eigenvectors" - vectors x E X of norm 1 such that II(T - X)xll is 
arbitrarily small. Moreover, the approximate eigenvectors can be chosen in 
an arbitrary subspace of finite codimension. This property is particularly 
useful in various inductive constructions. 
The following result was proved in [20]; for Hilbert space operators see 
141. 
Theorem 2.4. Let T be an operator on a Banach space X ,  let E > 0 and 
let (a,) be a sequence of positive numbers such that limn+m a, = 0. Then: 
(i) there exists a vector z E X such that llxll < sup, a, + E and llTnxll 2 
a, . r ( F )  for all n; 
(ii) there exists a dense subset of points x E X such that llTnxll 2 anr(Tn) 
for all but a finite number of n. 
Outline of the proof. Let X E a(T) satisfy 1x1 = r(T). We distinguish 
two cases: 
(a) Suppose that r(T) > re(T). Then X is an eigenvalue of T .  The corre- 
sponding eigenvector 2 of norm one satisfies ((T"lcll = IIX"z(( = r(T") for 
all n. 
Moreover, X is an isolated point of the spectrum of T and the spectral 
subspace Xo corresponding to X is finite dimensional. Let u E X \ XO. 
It is easy to verify that there is a positive constant c = c(u) such that 
llTjull 2 c .  r(Tj) for all j. Thus in this case the set of all points satisfying 
(ii) is even residual. 
(b) Let r(T) = re(T). Since X E uTe(T), 
for all E > 0, n E N and A4 c X of 
finite codimension there exists x E M such that IIxlI = 1 and II(Tj -Xj)xlI < 
E 
( j  5 n). These "approximate eigenvectors" are basic building stones 
used in the construction of the vector with the required properties. 
We indicate the proof for Hilbert space operators. 

59 
Without loss of generality it is possible to assume that 1 > a1 > a2 > 
w e  construct inductively vectors X k  E x of norm 1 such that Tjxk =

 r(T) = 1 and X = 1. For k 2 0 set r k  = min{j : aj < 2-'}.

(i < k , j  5 rk)} is of finite 
Set x = xFl 2-2+lzi. 
Let rk-1 < j 5 7-k. Since Tjxi 1 
Tjxk (i # k), we have 
Thus x satisfies llTjxll 2 aj for all j. 
The full statement of Theorem 2.4 can be obtained by a modification 
0 
of this argument; we omit the details. 
For Banach spaces the proof is a little bit more complicated. The basic 
idea is to use instead of the orthogonal complement of a finite dimensional 
subspace (which was in fact used here) the following lemma. 
Lemma 2.5. Let X be a Banach space, let F c X be a finite dimensional 
subspace and let E > 0. Then there exists a subspace M c X of finite 
codimension such that 
I b  + f II 2 (1 - E)max{llflli lle11P) 
for all f E F and m E M .  
An immediate consequence of Theorem 2.4 is the following corollary. 
Corollary 2.6.Let T E B ( X ) .  Then: 
(i) the set { x  E X : liminf,,, 
JJT"xJJ1/" 
= r(T)} is dense; 
(ii) the set { x  E X : limsup,,, 
llTnxlllln = r(T)} is residual; 
(iii) the set of all x E X such that the limit limn+, I(Tnxl('ln exists (and 
is equal to r(T)) is dense. 
As another corollary we get that the infimum and the supremum in the 
spectral radius formula 

60 
can be exchanged. 
Corollary 2.7. Let T E B(X). 
Then 
Example 2.8. Let H be a separable Hilbert space with an orthonormal 
basis (ej : j = 0,1,. . . } and let S be the backward shift, Seo = 0, Sej = 
ej-1 
Then the set {z E H : liminf,,, 
llS"zlll/" 
= 0} is 
residual. 
Since r(S) = 1 and the set {z E H : limsup,,, 
IIS"zlll/" = l} is also 
residual, we see that the set {z E H : the limit limn+, IISnzII1/" exists} 
is of the first category (but it is always dense by Corollary 2.6). 
Proof. For k E N let 
( j  2 1). 
Mk = { x  E X : there exists n L k such that IlS"x1I < k-"}. 
Clearly Mk is an open subset of X .  Further, Mk is dense in X. To see 
this, let u E X and c > 0. Let u = CEoajej and choose n 2 k such that 
Cj"=, 
lql2 < c2. Set y = CyIi ajej. Then IIy - u I I  < E and S"y = 0. 
Thus y E Mk and Mk is a dense open subset of X. 
By the Baire category theorem, the set A4 = nE"=,k is a dense G6 
subset of X, hence it is residual. 
Let x E M .  For each k E N there is an n k  2 k such that IJSnkzll < 
and so liminf,,, 
IIS"zJJ'/n = 0. 
0 
It is also possible to combine conditions of Theorems 2.2 and 2.4 and to 
obtain points z E X with llTnxl\ 2 a,. IITnII for all n; in this case, however, 
there is a restriction on the sequence (a,). 
Theorem 2.9. Let T E B ( X ) ,  let (a,) be a sequence of positive numbers 
such that C,U;'~ < 00. 
Then there exists x E X such that llTnxll 2 
anlITnll for all n. There is a dense subset L c X such that for each x E L 
there is a k E N with the property that 
llTnxll 2 anllTnll 
(n 2 k). 
Outline of the proof: Fix k E N. We indicate the construction of a 
vector x satisfying llTjxll _> ajIITjll 
( j  5 k). The vector satisfying this 
relations for all n can be then obtained by a limit procedure. 

61 
Let k E N be fixed. For j = 1,2,. . . , k fix a vector zj E X of norm 
one which almost attains the norm of Tj, i.e., llTjxll 
IlTjII (we omit the 
exact calculations). 
LetA={X=(Xl, ..., X k ) E ~ ' :  lXj15a~'3forallj}. ForXEAlet 
U A  = Cj=l 
Xjzj. Consider the Lebesgue measure p on A. 
For j = 1,. . . ,k let Aj = {A E A : llTju~II < ajIITjll}. The basic idea 
of the proof is to show that p ( A  \ Us=l,Aj) > 0, which means that there 
exists X E A such that llTju~II 2 aj IITJ 11 for all j = 1 , .  . . , k. For details 
k 
see [24]. 
A better estimate can be obtained if we replace the norm llSJJ of an op- 
erator 5' E B(X) by the quantity IISIIp = inf{ llSlMll : M c X,codimM < 
If S is an operator on a separable Hilbert space H then IISJJ, coincides 
4. 
with the essential norm llSlle = inf{llS + KII : K E K ( H ) } .  
For the proof of the next result see [24]. 
Theorem 2.10. Let T E B ( X ) .  Let (a,) be a sequence of positive numbers 
satisfying Cna, < co. Then there exists z E X such that JJTnzJJ 
2 
a,IITnlll, for all n. 
The results of Theorems 2.9 and 2.10 can be improved for Hilbert space 
operators, see [4]. 
Theorem 2.11. Let T be an operator on a Hilbert space H ,  let (a,) be a 
sequence of positive numbers. 
(i) if Enan < 00 then there exists z E H such that IJTnzll 2 a,JJT"II for 
all n E N; 
(ii) if C, 
a: < co then there exists z E H such that IIT"zll 2 a,((Tn((, for 
all n E N. 
The following result is true for Hilbert space operators; in Banach spaces 
it is false. 
Theorem 2.12. [4] Let T be a non-nilpotent operator on a Hilbert space 
H .  Then the set {x E H : C 
= 0 0 }  is residual.

i = 0 , l  ...}. Let T E B(X) be defined by Teo = 0 and Ten =

) e,-l 
Let X be the 
- 2  
(n 2 1). Then C 
< 00 for all z E X. 
n 
This can be verified by a direct calculation, see [24]. 
Remark 2.14. Some results from this section remain true for real Banach 
spaces as well, see [24]. This is true for Theorem 2.2. 
Theorem 2.4 can be reformulated as follows: if a, > 0, a, -+ 0, then 
there exists a dense subset L c X such that for each 2 E L there is a 
constant c > 0 with llTnzl( > ca,r(T)" for all n. 
Theorem 2.9 can be modified in the following way: let T be an operator 
on a real Banach space X, let (a,) be a sequence of positive numbers such 
that C,a~" < 00. Then there exists z E X such that IITnz(( 2 a,(lT"(( 
for all n. There is a dense subset L c X such that for each z E L there is 
a k E N with the property that 
IIT"zll 2 anllTnll 
(n 2 k). 
3. Hypercyclic vectors 
Vectors with extremely irregular orbits are called hypercyclic. More pre- 
cisely, a vector z E X is called hypercyclic for an operator T E B ( X )  if the 
set {Tnz : n = 0,1,. . . } is dense in X. An operator T is called hypercyclic 
if there is at least one vector hypercyclic for T .  
Recall also that a vector z E X is called cyclic for T E B ( X )  if the set 
{p(T)z : p polynomial} is dense in X, and supercyclic for T if {AT"% : X E 
These notions make sense only for separable Banach spaces. It is easy 
to see that an operator in a non-separable Banach space can not have cyclic 
(supercyclic, hypercyclic) vectors. Moreover, it is not difficult to show that 
there are no hypercyclic operators on finite-dimensional Banach spaces (this 
follows from the fact that T* has eigenvalues, cf. the proof of Theorem 3.2 
below). In the rest of this section we assume that all Banach spaces are 
infinite dimensional and separable. 
It is easy to find an operator that is not hypercyclic. For example, any 
contraction (or more generally, a power bounded operator) is not hyper- 
cyclic. On the other hand, if T has at least one hypercyclic vector then 
almost all vectors are hypercyclic. 
c,n = 0 , l .  . . }- = x. 

63 
Theorem 3.1. Let T E B ( X )  be a hypercyclic operator. Then there is 
a residual set of vectors hypercyclic for T .  
Proof. Let x E X be hypercyclic for T. For each Ic E N the vector Tkx is 
hypercyclic for T ,  and so the set of all hypercyclic vectors is dense. 
Let (Uj) be a countable base of open subsets in X .  It is easy to see that 
the set of all vectors hypercyclic for T is equal to nj U, T-nUj, which is a 
Gs subset. 
0 
Theorem 3.2. Let T E B ( X )  be a hypercyclic operator. Then there 
exists a dense linear manifold L c X such that each nonzero vector in L is 
hypercyclic for T .  
Proof. We show first that T* has no eigenvalues. Suppose on the contrary 
that there are X E C and a nonzero vector x* E X *  such that T*x* = Ax*. 
Let x E X be a hypercyclic vector for T. Then 
C =  {(T,x,x*) : n = 0 , 1 ,  ... } - = ( x , x * ) * ( X ~ : ~ = O , ~  
,... }-. 
It is easy to see that the last set can not be dense in C. Thus X is not an 
eigenvalue of T*, and so (T - X)X is dense in X for each X E C. 
Let x be a hypercyclic vector for T. We show that p(T)x is also hyper- 
cyclic for each nonzero polynomial p. Write p ( z )  = a(z - XI) . . . (2 - A,) 
where a # 0, XI,. . . ,A, 
E C. Then 
(T"p(T)x : n = 0,1,. . . } = a(T - X i ) .  . . (T - X,){Tnx : 72 = 0,1,. . . }. 
The last set is dense in X since x is hypercyclic for T ,  and the operators 
T - Xj have dense ranges for each j. Thus p(T)x is hypercyclic for T .  0 
The following criterion provides a simple way of constructing hypercyclic 
vectors, see [16], [ll]. It also implies property (iii) in Example 1.4. 
Theorem 3.3. Let T E B ( X ) .  Suppose that there is an increasing se- 
quence of positive integers (nk) such that: 
(i) there is a dense subset X O  c X such that lim~--tmTnkx 
4 0 for all 
x E x,; 
(ii) Uk 
T"kBx is dense in X ,  where Bx denotes the closed unit ball in X .  
Then T is hypercyclic. By Theorem 3.1, this means that the set of all 
hypercyclic vectors is residual. 
Conversely, suppose that T is hypercyclic. Then it is not difficult to 
show that T satisfies both conditions (i) and (ii), but not necessarily for 

64 
the same subsequence ( n k ) .  Thus the conditions in Theorem 3.3 are close 
to the notion of hypercyclicity (cf. Problem 3.12). 
A similar criterion may be used to construct closed infinite dimensional 
subspaces consisting of hypercyclic vectors, see [19], [12] and [17]. 
Theorem 3.4. Let T E B ( X ) .  Suppose that T satisfies the conditions 
of Theorem 3.3 and that the essential spectrum a,(T) intersects the closed 
unit ball. Then there is a closed infinite dimensional subspace M c X such 
that each nonzero vector in M is hypercyclic for T .  
Theorems 3.1 - 3.4 indicate that hypercyclic vectors and operators are 
quite common, that in some sense it is a typical behavior of an orbit. 
Similarly as in Theorem 3.1 it is possible to show that the set of all 
hypercyclic operators on a Banach space X is a Gg set. It is not dense 
since the operators with IlTll < 1 can not be hypercyclic. Thus the set of 
all hypercyclic operators is a residual subset of its closure. 
By [15], it is possible to characterize the closure of hypercyclic operators 
on a separable Hilbert space. For Banach spaces such a characterization is 
not known. 
Theorem 3.5. Let H be a separable Hilbert space, let T E B ( H ) .  Then T 
belongs to the closure of hypercyclic operators if and only if the following 
conditions are satisfied: 
(i) the set aw(T) U { z  E C : IzI = 1) is connected; 
(ii) ao(T) = 0; 
(iii) ind (A - 5") 2 0 for all X E C such that X - T is semi-Fredholm. 
Here aw(T) denotes the Weyl spectrum of T ,  aw(T) = nKEK(H) 
a(T+ 
K). Equivalently, X $ aw (T) if and only if T - X is Fredholm and ind (T - 
Recall that an operator S is called semi-Fredholm if it has closed range 
and either dim ker S < co or codim SX < 00. The index of a semi-Fredholm 
operator S is defined by ind S = dim ker S - codim SX. 
Furthermore, ao(T) denotes the set of all isolated points of a(T) such 
that the corresponding spectral subspace is finite dimensional. 
A) = 0. 
Theorem 3.6. Let T E B(X) 
be an operator and let z E X be hypercyclic 
for T .  Then: 

65 
(i) z is hypercyclic for T" for each n E N; 
(ii) z is hypercyclic for AT for each X E C, 1x1 = 1; 
(iii) if T is invertible then T-' is hypercyclic. 
The first statement of Theorem 3.6 was proved in [2]. For (ii) see [MI. 
The third statement follows from the observation that T is hypercyclic if 
and only if for all nonempty open subsets U, V c X there exists n E N such 
that T"U n V # 0. 
Although it is relatively easy to construct an operator with a residual 
set of hypercyclic vectors (see Example 1.4), it is extremely difficult to con- 
struct an operator with all nonzero vectors hypercyclic. The first example 
of this type was constructed by Read [29] on the space el. Equivalently, 
such an operator has no nontrivial closed invariant subset. It is an open 
problem whether this can happen in Hilbert spaces, cf. Problems 1.2 and 
1.3. 
The next result shows that such an operator must satisfy certain rather 
narrow conditions on the norms IITn(l. 
Theorem 3.7. Let T be an operator on a Banach space X which has no 
nontrivial closed invariant subsets. Then r(T) = re(T) = 1, supn llT"ll = 
00, C, ((Tnll-2/3 < 00 and C, llTn(lil < 00. 
If X is a Hilbert space then C, JJTnJJ-' 
< co and C, JJTn]1,1'2 < 00. 
Indeed, if T does not satisfy the conditions above, then either T is power 
bounded or there exists a vector z E X with llTnzll + 00, see Theorems 
2.4, 2.9, 2.10 and 2.11. Hence {Tnz : n = 0,l . . , }- is a nontrivial closed 
invariant subset with respect to T. 
Thus it is a very interesting question for which operators there are orbits 
satisfying llTnzll + co. 
Problem 3.8. What are the best exponents in Theorem 3.7? 
Example 3.9. There is an operator T on a Hilbert space H such that 
llTn(l + co and there is no z E H with \lTnxll + 00, see [4]. As an example 
it is possible to take a unilateral weighted shift with suitable weights; the 
operator satisfies ((T"1) = (lnn)1/2. 
It is also possible to construct an operator T E B ( H )  such that 
inf, IIT"zII = 0 and SUP, llTnzll = 00 for all nonzero vectors z E H .  

66 
We finish this section with some other open problems. 
Problem 3.10. 
Let T be a Hilbert space operator such that 
limn+w llTnll = 00 and the norms llTnll form a nondecreasing sequence. 
Does there exist a vector z E H such that IIT"zll --t oo? 
Problem 3.11. Is the characterization of the closure of hypercyclic oper- 
ators (Theorem 3.5) true also for Banach spaces? 
Problem 3.12. Does there exist a hypercyclic operator T E B(X) 
that 
does not satisfy conditions of Theorem 3.3? 
The most 
interesting reformulation is: does there exist a hypercyclic operator T such 
that T @ T is not hypercyclic, see [5]? 
There are other equivalent formulations of this problem. 
Problem 3.13. An operator T E B ( X )  is called weakly hypercyclic if 
there exists a vector z E X such that the orbit {Tnz : n = 0,1,. . . } is 
weakly dense in X, see [9]. Does there exists a weakly hypercyclic operator 
that is not hypercyclic? Must a weakly dense orbit be norm dense? 
Note that the corresponding notion of weakly cyclic vectors makes no 
sense since a weakly closed linear manifold is automatically closed by the 
Hahn-Banach theorem. 
4. Weak orbits 
Weak orbits were introduced and first studied by van Neerven [26]. Many 
results for orbits of operators can be modified also for weak orbits. For a 
survey of results see e.g. [26], [24]. 
The following three results are analogous to the corresponding state- 
ments for orbits. 
Theorem 4.1. Let T E B(X) and let (a,) be a sequence of positive 
numbers such that limn--rwan = 0. Then the set of all pairs (x,z*) 
E 
X x X* with the property that I(Tnz, z*)l > a,IITnll for infinitely many n 
is a residual subset of X x X*. 
Theorem 4.2. Let T be an operator on a Banach space X, let (a,) be 
a sequence of positive numbers such that C, 
< 00. Then there exist 
z E X and x* E X* such that I(Tnz,z*)l 
2 anIITnll for all n. 
Theorem 4.3. Let T E B(X). 
Then: 

67 
(i) the set {(z,z*) E X x X* : liminf I(Tnz,z*)(l/n 
= r(T)} is dense; 
n-im 
(ii) the set { (x, 
z*) E X x X* : limsup I(Tnx, x*)(lln 
= T(T)} is residual; 
n-+w 
(iii) the set of all pairs (5, z*) E X x X* 
such that the limit lim I(Tnx)I1/n 
exists (and is equal to r(T)) is dense. 
n-+m 
The statement analogous to Theorem 2.12 for weak orbits is not true: 
Example 4.4. There exists an operator T on a Hilbert space H such that 
c 
< co for all x,y E H. 
n 
As an example it is possible to take the operator T = @El Sk, where 
Sk is the shift operator on a (k + 1)-dimensional Hilbert space, see [24]. 
The statement analogous to Theorem 2.4 for weak orbits is an open 
problem: 
Problem 4.5. Let T E B ( X ) ,  let (a,) be a sequence of positive numbers 
satisfying lim,-,man = 0. Do there exist x E X and z* E X* such that 
I(Tnx,z*)) 
2 anr(Tn) for all n? 
The statement is false for real Banach spaces. A partial positive answer 
is given in the following case which is important from the point of view of 
the invariant subspace problem. Some other partial results were given in 
P61. 
Theorem 4.6. Let T be an operator on a Hilbert space H such that 
1 E a(T) and Tnz -+ 0 for all z E H .  Let (a,) be a sequence of positive 
numbers satisfying limn+man = 0. Then there exists z E H such that 
Re (T"x, 
5) > a, for all n. 
Using Theorem 4.6 and techniques of [18] it is possible to obtain the 
following result. 
Theorem 4.7. Let T be a power bounded operator on a Hilbert space H 
satisfying r(T) = 1. Then there is a nonzero vector x E H such that x 
is not supercyclic. Moreover, T has a nontrivial closed invariant positive 
cone, i.e., there is a nontrivial closed subset M c H such that T M  c M ,  
M + M c M and t M  c M 
(t 2 0). 

68 
It is a natural question whether the previous result can be improved in 
order to obtain an invariant real subspace. 
Problem 4.8. Let T be a power bounded operator on a Hilbert space such 
that r(T) = 1. Does T have a nontrivial closed invariant real subspace, i.e., 
does there exists a nontrivial closed subset M c H such that T M  C M ,  
M + M c M and t M  c M 
(t E R) ? 
Problem 4.9. 
spaces ? 
Is Theorem 4.7 true for operators on reflexive Banach 
5. Polynomial orbits 
If 2 is an eigenvector of T ,  T x  = Xz for some complex A, then p(T)a: = 
p(X)x for every polynomial p, and so we have a complete information about 
the polynomial orbit {p(T)z : p polynomial}. Unfortunately, operators on 
infinite dimensional Banach spaces have usually no eigenvalues. The proper 
tool appears to be the notion of the essential approximate point spectrum 
a?re(T). 
The following result is an analogue of Theorem 2.4. 
Theorem 5.1. [22] Let T be an operator on a Banach space X ,  let X E 
axe(T). Let (a,) be a sequence of positive numbers with 
a, = 0. 
Then: 
(i) there exists x E X such that 
llP(T)X11 2 adegp IP(X>l 
for every polynomial p; 
(ii) let u E X ,  E > 0. Then there exists y E X and a positive constant 
C = C(E) such that IIy - 
u I I  5 E and 
IlP(T)Yll 2 C ' a d e g p '  b(X)l 
for every polynomial p. 
In the previous theorem we expressed the estimate of llp(T)x11 by means 
of Ip(X)l where X was a fixed element of axe(T). Next we are looking for 
an estimate in terms of max{lp(X)( : X E aTe(T)}. 
Since da,(T) 3 aTe(T), 
by the spectral mapping theorem for the essential spectrum ae we have 

69 
An important tool for the results in this section is the following classical 
lemma of Fekete [lo]. It enables to estimate the maximum of a polynomial 
on a (in general very complicated) compact set u&?) 
by means of its 
values at finitely many points. 
Lemma 5.2. Let K be a non-empty compact subset of the complex plane 
and let k 2 1. Then there exist points U O ,  ul,. . . , U k  E K such that 
m={Ip(z)I : E K }  I 
(k + 1) . m= 
IP(Ui)l 
O l i S k  
for every polynomial p with degp 5 k. Moreover, we have 
for all polynomials p with degp I 
k. 
By using the previous lemma we can get [21], [23] 
Theorem 5.3. Let T be an operator on a Banach space X, let E 2 0 and 
k 2 1. Then: 
(i) if carda,,(T) 2 k + 1 then there exists x E X with ((Ic(( = 1 and 
for every polynomial p with degp I 
k. 
(ii) let x E X and E > 0. Then there exists y E X and a positive constant 
C = C(E) such that IIy - 
X I (  5 E and 
IMT)YII 2 c (1 + degp)-(l+E) re(p(T)) 
for every polynomial p .  
The proof of Theorem 5.3 is much simpler for operators on Hilbert 
spaces. The same result for Banach space operators can be obtained by a 
Dvoretzky’s theorem type argument. A simpler proof based on Lemma 2.5 
is available for weaker estimates Ilp(T)xII 2 z(k;t)2re(p(T)) and llp(T)z/( _> 
C . (1 + degp)-(2+E)r,(p(T)), respectively. 
The estimates in Theorem 5.3 (i) are the best possible. 
Example 5.4.[23] Let k E N. There exists a Banach space X and an 
operator T E B ( X )  such that for each x E X of norm one there is a 
polynomial p of degree 5 k with llp(T)xll I 
(k + l)-lr,(p(T)).

6. Capacity 
The notion of capacity of an operator (or more generally, of a Banach 
algebra element) was introduced and studied by Halmos [13]. If T E B ( X )  
then 
capT = lim (capkT)llk = inf(capkT)l/k, 
k-+m 
k 
where 
capkT = inf { Ilp(T))) : p E PL} 
and P; is the set of all monic (i.e., with leading coefficient equal to 1) 
polynomials of degree k. 
This is a generalization of the classical notion of capacity (sometimes 
also called Tshebyshev constant) of a nonempty compact subset K of the 
complex plane: 
cap K = lim (capkK)llk = inf(capkK)l/k 
k-cc 
k 
where 
capkK = inf { l l p l l ~  : p E P l }  
and 
The classical capacity cap K is equal to the capacity of the identical 
function f(z) = z considered as an element of the Banach algebra of all 
continuous functions on K with the sup-norm. 
Another connection between these two notions is given by the following 
main result of [13]. 
Theorem 6.1. capT = capa(T) for each operator T E B ( X ) .  
l l p l ) ~  
= sup{lp(z)l : z E K}. 
Let x E X. The local capacity of T at x can be defined analogously. 
We define 
capk(T,x) = inf { IIp(T)xll p E P i }  
and 
cap (T, x) = lim sup capk(T, x)l/k 
k+cc 
(in general the limit does not exist). 
It is easy to see that cap(T, x) 5 cap T for every x E X .  
Note that there is an analogy between the spectral radius and the ca- 
pacity of an operator: 

71 
r,(T) = limsup I I T ~ x ) ) ' ~ ' ,  
capT = lim (cap kT)llk = inf(cap kT)'lk, 
k-+m 
k+m 
cap (T, x) = lim sup (cap k(T, z)) I l k  . 
k-+m 
Furthermore, capT 5 r(T) and cap(T,x) I r,(T) for all z E X. 
Theorem 6.2. Let T E B ( X ) .  Then: 
[a) 
the set (x E x : liminfk,, 
capk(T, z)l/k = capT} is dense an x; 
(ii) the set {x E X : cap(T, x) = cap T} is residual in X; 
(iii) the set {x E x : limk,, 
cap k(T, x)llk = cap T} as dense in x. 
Outline of the proof. By Theorem 5.3, there is a dense subset of vectors 
II: E X with the property that IIp(T)zll 2 C * (1 + degp)-2re(p(T)) for all 
polynomials p. Thus we have 
caPk(T,z) 
inf{llP(T)zll : P  E pi} 
2 C .  (1 + k)-2inf{re(p(T)) : p E Pi} = C(1+ k)-2capkae(T). 
Hence 
liminf(cap k ~ ) l / k  2 liminf(cap k a , ( ~ ) ) l / ~  
= cap ae(T). 
Using the general relations between o(T) and a,(T), it is possible to see that 
capo,(T) = capa(T). Hence, by Theorem 6.1,liminfk,,(cap 
(T,z))'lk = 
capT for all x in a dense subset of X. 
0 
k-cm 
k-m 
The second statement requires a more refined arguments, see [24]. 
An operator T E B ( X )  is called quasialgebraic if and only if cap T = 0. 
Similarly, T is called locally quasialgebraic if cap (T, II:) 
= 0 for every z E X. 
It follows from Theorem 6.2 that these two notions are equivalent. 
Corollary 6.3. An operator is quasialgebraic if and only if at is locally 
quasialge braic. 
Corollary 6.3 is an analogy to the well-known result of Kaplansky: an 
operator is algebraic (i.e. p ( T )  = 0 for some non-zero polynomial p )  if and 
only if it is locally algebraic (i-e., for every II: E X there exists a polynomial 
p ,  # 0 such that p,(T)a: = 0). 
7. Scott Brown technique 
The Scott Brown technique is an efficient way of constructing invariant sub- 
spaces. It was first used for subnormal operators but later it was adapted 

72 
to contractions on Hilbert spaces and, more generally, to polynomially 
bounded operators on Banach spaces. Some results are also known for 
n-tuples of commuting operators. 
The basic idea of the Scott Brown technique is to construct a weak 
orbit {(T"x, 
x*) : n = 0, 1, . . . } which behaves in a precise way. Typically, 
vectors x E X and x* E X* are constructed such that 
0 
n Z 1 ;  
{ 1 
n=0. 
(T"x,x*) = 
Equivalently, 
(P(T)X, 
x*) = P(0) 
(1) 
for all polynomials p. Then T has a nontrivial closed invariant subspace. 
Indeed, either T x  = 0 (and x generates a 1-dimensional invariant subspace) 
or the vectors {Tnz : n 2 1) generate a nontrivial closed invariant subspace. 
The vectors x and x* satisfying the above described conditions are con- 
structed as limits of sequences that satisfy (1) approximately. 
Let D = { z  E CC : JzI < 1) denote the open unit disc in the complex 
plane and T = { z  E CC : IzI = 1) the unit circle. Denote by P the normed 
space of all polynomials with the norm IJpJJ 
= sup{)p(z)) : z E D}. Let P* 
be its dual with the usual dual norm. 
Let $ E P*. By the Hahn-Banach theorem, $ can be extended without 
changing the norm to a functional on the space of all continuous function on 
T with the sup-norm. By the Resz theorem, there exists a Bore1 measure p 
on T such that ((pL(( 
= 11$11 and $(p) = J p d p  for all polynomials p. Clearly, 
the measure is not unique. 
Let L1 be the Banach space of all complex integrable functions on T 
with the norm llflll = (27r)-'J:", 
If(eit))dt. 
Of particular interest are the following functionals on P: 
(i) Let X E D. Denote by Ex the evaluation at the point A, i.e., Ex is defined 
by Exb) = P ( 4  (P E PI. 
(ii) Let f E L1. Denote by M f  E P* the functional defined by 
~ f ( p )  
= (27r)-1/" 
p(e"">(eit)dt 
( p  E P). 
--x 
Then IlMfll F Ilflll. 
The evaluation functionals Ex are also of this type. Indeed, for X E D 
we have Ex = Mpx, where Px(eit) = -5 
is the Poisson kernel. In 
1-JX12 

73 
particular, if g = 1 then Mg(p) = p(0) for all p ,  and so Mg is the evaluation 
at the origin. 
(iii) Let k > 0 and let T : X -+ X a polynomially bounded operator with 
constant k, i.e., T satisfies the condition Ilp(T)II 5 IclJpJJ 
for all polynomials 
p. Fix x E X and x* E X*. Let x @ x* E P* be the functional defined by 
(. 
@ X*>(P) = (p(T)x, x*) 
(P E P). 
Since T is polynomially bounded, x @ x* is a bounded functional and we 
Of course the definition of x@x* depends on the operator T but since we 
are going to consider only one operator T ,  this can not lead to a confusion. 
By the von Neumann inequality, any contraction on a Hilbert space is 
polynomially bounded with constant 1. More generally, every operator on 
a Hilbert space which is similar to a contraction is polynomially bounded. 
Recall that there are polynomially bounded Hilbert space operators that are 
not similar to a contraction. This was shown recently by Pisier [27] who 
gave thus a negative answer to a well-known longstanding open problem 
given by Halmos. 
have llx @x*II 5 kllzll . llz*II. 
Denote by L" 
the space of all bounded measurable functions on 
with 
the sup-norm. Since P c Loo = (L1)*, the space P inherits the w*-topology 
from L". 
Of particular importance for the Scott Brown technique are those func- 
tionals on P that are w*-continuous, i.e., that are continuous functions 
from (P, 
w*) to @. Equivalently, these functionals can be represented by 
absolutely continuous measures. 
The next result summarizes the basic facts about w*-continuous func- 
tionals on P. 
Theorem 7.1. 
(i) Let (pn) C P be a sequence of polynomials. Then p , s O  if and only i f  
(pn) is a Montel sequence, i.e., supn JJp,)I < 00 and pn(z) + 0 
(ii) The w* closure of P in L" 
is the Hardy space H" 
of all bounded 
functions analytic on JD. 
(iii) 1c, E P* is w*-continuous if and only if it can be represented by an 
absolutely continuous measure. By the F. and M. Riesz theorem, in this 
case each measure representing 11, is absolutely continuous. By the Radon- 
Nilcodym theorem, there exists f E L1 such that llflll = II11,II and 11, = M f .  
( z  E ID); 

74 
(iv) Let @ E P* be w*-continuous. Let A c D be a dominant subset, 
i.e., supxe,, I f ( X ) l  = 1 1  f l l  for all f E H". 
Let E > 0. Then there are 
numbers XI,. . . ,A, 
E A and 0 1 , .  . . ,a, E C such that CZ1 jail 5 ll@ll and 
[I@ - c:=, 
&xi 
11 < E .  
Let T E B ( X )  be a polynomially bounded operator such that IIT"uII -+ 
0 for all u E X .  Then all the functionals x @ x* can be represented by 
absolutely continuous measures. Equivalently, these functionals are w*- 
continuous, i.e., they are continuous on the space (P, w*). These results 
can be shown using classical results from measure theory. 
We summarize the results in the following theorem. Conditions (iii) and 
(iv) are not necessary for our purpose, we include them only for the sake 
of completeness. 
Theorem 7.2. Let T be a polynomially bounded operator on a Banach 
space X .  Suppose that IIT"uII .+ 0 for all u E X .  Then: 
(a) x @ x* can be represented by an absolutely continuous measure for all 
x E X and x* E X * .  Equivalently, x @ x* is w*-continuous; 
(ii) the set {p(T)x : p E P, llpll 5 1) is precompact for all x E X ;  
(iii) the functional p H (p(T)x, x*) extends to the w*-closure of P in Loo, 
i.e., to the Hardy space H" 
of all bounded functions analytic on D; 
(iv) it i s  possible to define the HOO-functional calculus, i.e., an algebraic 
homomorphism @ : H" 
--+ B ( X )  such that Q(1) = I and @(z) = T .  
Moreover, @ i s  (w*,SOT) continuous, i.e., the mapping h -+ @(h)x is a 
continuous function from (Hm, w*) to X for each x E X .  
Now we are able to give an illustrative example how the Scott Brown 
technique works. 
Theorem 7.3. Let T be a contraction on a Hilbert space H such that 
a(T) n D i s  dominant in D and IIT"xII --+ 0 for all x E H .  Then T has a 
nontrivial closed invariant subspace. 
Outline of the proof. Without loss of generality we may assume that 
neither T nor T* has eigenvalues. In particular, a,,(T) = a(T). 
The first step in the proof is that we can approximate (with an arbitrary 
precision) the evaluation functionals Ex for X E ane(T) 
by the functionals 
of the type x @ x with x E H .  

75 
(a) Let X E ore(T), 
E > 0, let z E H ,  IIzlI = 1 and II(T - X)zll < E .  Then 
Indeed, we have 
2ke 
I (p(T)z, 4 - P(X) I = I (q(T)(T - X)z, 4 1 I Il4J(T)II 
* II (T - X>4l I q. 
For the approximation procedure we need a stronger version of (a). 
(b) Let u1,. 
. . ,u, E H be given. Let X E a&!') 
and E > 0. Then there 
exists z E H of norm 1 such that z I 
(211,. . . , u,} and 
115 €3 z - 8x11 < E ,  
112€3Uill < &  
(i=1, ..., n), 
llut €3 511 < & 
(i = 1,. . . , n). 
Indeed, since X E orre(T), 
we can choose a vector 5 I 
{ u ~ , .  
. . , u,} such 
that II(T - X)zll is small enough. Thus the inequality llz 18 z - Ex11 < E 
follows from (a). Using the same estimates it is possible to obtain also that 
For the last inequality (note that the second and third inequalities are 
not symmetrical!) it is possible to use the compactness of the set {p(T)ui : 
llpll I 1, i = 1,. . . , T I } - ,  see Theorem 7.2 (ii). Indeed, it is possible to choose 
z "almost orthogonal" to all vectors of the form p(T)ui where ((p(( I 1 and 
2 = 1, ..., n. 
In the following we use the fact that any w*-continuous functional can be 
approximated by convex linear combinations of the evaluations at points of 
oae(T), 
see Theorem 7.1 (iv). We show that if 1c, E P* is any w*-continuous 
functional and z €3 y its approximation, then it is possible to find a better 
approximation X I  €3 y' of 1c, that is not too far from z €3 y. 
(c) Let 1c, E P* be a w*-continuous functional, let z,y E H and E > 0. 
Then there are XI, y' E H such that

Indeed, by Theorem 7.1 (iv) there are elements Xi,. . . ,An E a,,(T) and 
nonzero complex numbers al, . . . ,an such that CZl Iai( I 112 8 Y - $11

The condition that Tnx + 0 for all x E H can be omitted by a standard 
reduction argument. 
Theorem 7.4. [6]Let T be a contraction on a Hilbert space H such that 
the spectrum a(T) 
nD is dominant in D. Then T has a nontrivial invariant 
subspace. 
Outline of the proof. Let MI = {x E H : Tnx 
-+ 0). It is easy to see 
that MI is a closed subspace of H invariant with respect to T. If M I  = H 
that T has a nontrivial invariant subspace by Theorem 7.3. Thus we can 
assume without loss of generality that MI = (0). 
Since a subspace M c H is an invariant subspace for T if and only if M I  
is an invariant subspace for T*, we can do all the previous considerations 
also for T* instead of T. Thus we can also assume that M2 = {x E H : 
T * n ~  
-+ 0) = (0). 
Contractions T E B ( H )  satisfying MI = (0) = Mz are called contrac- 
tions of class C11 in [25]. It is proved there that such T is quasisimilar to 
a unitary operator (i.e., there are a Hilbert space K ,  a unitary operator 
U E B(K) and injective operators A : H t K, B : K 
H with dense 
ranges such that UA = AT and BU = TB). Consequently, T has many 
invariant subspaces, see [25]. 
0 
Theorem 7.4 is a classical application of the Scott Brown technique. By 
refined methods it is possible to obtain the following much deeper result. 
Theorem 7.5. [7] Let T be a contraction on a Hilbert space H such that 
a(T) contains the unit circle { z  E C : Izl = 1). Then T has a nontrivial 
closed invariant subspace. 
Theorem 7.5 can be also generalized to the Banach space setting. 
Theorem 7.6. [l] Let T be a polynomially bounded operator on a Banach 
space X such that a(T) 
contains the unit circle. Then T* has a nontrivial 
invariant subspace. In particular, if X is reflexive then T has an invariant 
subspace. 
Note that Theorem 7.6 is stronger than Theorem 7.5 even for Hilbert 
space operators.

1. Baire’s categories 
Let X be a complete metric space. According to Baire’s classical theorem, 
the intersection of every countable collection of open, dense subsets of X 
is dense in X .  This rather simple, yet powerful result has found many 
applications. In particular, given a property which elements of X may 
have, it is of interest to determine whether this property is generic. In other 
words, whether the set of elements which do enjoy this property contains 
a residual subset, that is, a countable intersection of open, dense sets. A 
generic property may be thought of as being, in some sense, “typical”. Such 
an approach, when a certain property is investigated for the whole space X 
and not just for a single point in X ,  has already been successfully applied 
in many areas of Analysis (see, for example, [8, 9, 27, 29, 301, Chapter 16 
in [15], and the references mentioned there). 
Recall that a set E c X is called nowhere dense if its closure contains 
no nonempty open subset of X .  Any countable union of nowhere dense sets 
is said to be of the first Baire category; all other subsets of X are of the 
second Baire category. Thus Baire’s theorem can be rephrased as follows: 
no complete metric space is of the first category. 
After reviewing the related concepts of porosity and null sets in the 
next two sections, we intend to illustrate the generic approach to nonlinear 
problems by presenting and discussing several simple examples of its ap- 
plications to nonexpansive mapping theory. These applications involve the 
convergence of iterates, contractive mappings, well-posedness, and strict 
contractions. An extension theorem for contractive mappings, which may 
be of independent interest, is also included. 
2. Porous sets 
In this section we discuss the concept of porosity [2], [7]-[9], 
[27]-[30] 
which 
is a refinement of the notion of Baire’s first category. 
Let (Y, 
d) be a complete metric space. We denote by Bd(y, r) the closed 
ball of center y E Y and radius r > 0. We say that a subset E c Y is porous 
in (Y, d )  if there exist Q E (0,l) and rg > 0 such that for each r E (0, rg] 
and each y E Y ,  there exists z E Y for which 
&(z, Qr) c &(Y, r )  \ E. 
A subset of the space Y is called 0-porous in (Y, d )  if it is a countable union 
of porous subsets in (Y, d). 
Other notions of porosity have been used in the literature [2, 341. We

use the rather strong notion which appears, for instance, in [7]-[9], 
[27], 
[28], 
and which turns out to be appropriate for our purposes. 
Since porous sets are nowhere dense, all a-porous sets are of the first 
Baire category. If Y is a finite-dimensional Euclidean space R", then the 
Lebesgue density theorem implies that a-porous sets are of Lebesgue mea- 
sure 0. The existence of a non-a-porous set P c R" which is of the first 
Baire category and of Lebesgue measure 0 was established in [33, 341. It 
is easy to see that for any a-porous set A c R", the set A IJ P c R" 
also belongs to the family E of all the non-a-porous subsets of R" which 
are of the first Baire category and have Lebesgue measure 0. Moreover, if 
Q E E is a countable union of sets Qi c Rn, i = 1,2,. 
. . , then there is a 
natural number j for which the set Qj is non-a-porous. Evidently, this set 
Qj also belongs to 1. Therefore one sees that the family E is quite large. 
Also, every complete metric space without isolated points contains a closed 
nowhere dense set which is not a-porous [35]. 
To point out the difference between porous and nowhere dense sets, note 
that if E c Y is nowhere dense, y E Y and r > 0, then there are a point 
a E Y and a number s > 0 such that Bd(a, s) c Bd(y, r )  \ E. If, however, 
E is also porous, then for small enough r we can choose s = ar, where 
a E (0,l) is a constant which depends only on E. 
In general, when we look for either genericity or porosity results we are 
faced with the problem of choosing an appropriate metric with the goal of 
obtaining a large set of "good" elements. Usually, a given (function) space 
can be equipped with several natural metrics and an optimal choice is not 
possible. For example, in a genericity result we want the set of "good" 
elements to be dense with respect to a strong topology and to be a Gg set 
with respect to a weak topology. To overcome this difficulty, we used a 
two-topology approach in [25]. In the setting of Banach space geometry 
such an approach was first used in [ll]. In the context of porosity we need 
to use a two-metric approach. 
The concept of porosity with respect to a pair of metrics was introduced 
in [36] and used in [29, 301. To define this concept, assume that Y is a 
nonempty set and that d l ,  d2 : Y x Y + [O,oo) are two metrics which 
satisfy dl(z,y) 5 dz(z,y) for all 5, 
y E Y .  
We say that a subset E c Y is porous in Y with respect to the pair 
(d1,dz) (or just porous in Y if the pair of metrics is understood) if there 
exist (Y E (0,l) and TO > 0 such that for each r E (0, TO] and each y E Y ,  
there exists z E Y for which &(z, y) 5 r and B d l  (a, ar) n E = 8. 
A subset of the space Y is called a-porous in Y with respect to (dl, dz) 

84 
(or just a-porous in Y if the pair of metrics is understood) if it is a countable 
union of porous (with respect to ( d l ,  d2)) subsets of Y .  
Note that if dl = d2, then by Proposition 1.1 of [36] our definitions 
reduce to those in [7]-[9], [27], [28]. 
Notice also that the porosity of a set with respect to one of the metrics dl 
or d2 does not imply its porosity with respect to the other metric. However, 
it is shown in [36], Proposition 1.2, that if a subset E c Y is porous with 
respect to ( d l , d 2 ) ,  then E is porous with respect to any metric d which is 
between dl and d2, that is, cldl 5 d 5 c2d2 for some positive c1 and c2. 
In the next section we discuss the concept of null sets in infinite- 
dimensional Banach spaces. In such spaces the relationships between a- 
porous sets and null sets are not yet fully understood. For instance, in [20] 
the authors construct a subset M of the separable Hilbert space l 2  which 
is porous in a very strong sense (arbitrarily close to each z E M ,  there 
is a “hole”, that is, a ball of radius one, which is completely outside M ) ,  
but at the same time very large in the sense of measure. This construction 
was generalized in [21] to separable superreflexive Banach spaces. Such 
phenomena are impossible in a finite-dimensional setting. 
3. Null sets 
In the previous two sections we reviewed two related useful methods for find- 
ing points which are plentiful in either a topological or a stronger, metric 
sense. This approach to proving that a certain subset is dense is, however, 
not always suitable. For instance, let f : R” -+ R be a Lipschitz function. 
Then, by a theorem of Rademacher, f is differentiable almost everywhere. 
Nevertheless, the set of points where f is differentiable can be of the first 
category. This raises the question of how we are going to prove a generaliza- 
tion of Rademacher’s theorem to infinitely many dimensions, as, obviously, 
Baire’s theorem is not going to be of help. A natural idea, which indeed 
turns out to work, is to introduce a concept analogous to Lebesgue null 
sets, and hence also a notion of a property holding almost everywhere, in 
separable infinite-dimensional Banach spaces. 
Here are some natural requirements such a family of null sets should 
satisfy: 
(i) Every translate of a null set is null. This is necessary for the appli- 
cation we have in mind. Let a Lipschitz function f be defined on a 
set A and let B be a translate of A. Define a new Lipschitz function 
g on B by composing f with an appropriate translation. Then the 

85 
set of points where g is not differentiable is just a translate of the 
set where f was not differentiable. 
(ii) Nonempty open sets are not null. This is natural, as we want to 
use null sets to prove that certain subsets of their complements are 
dense. 
(iii) A countable union of null sets is null. This will be a useful tool. 
Often we can describe the desired property by excluding countably 
many “bad” cases. If each of them happens only on a null set, then 
their union is also a null set, and hence the desired property takes 
place almost everywhere. 
All of the above properties are, of course, satisfied by Lebesgue null 
sets in Rn. Hence it seems natural in infinite-dimensional Banach spaces 
to also look for a translation-invariant Borel measure p which would play 
the role of the Lebesgue measure and then to consider its null sets. This 
idea, however, does not pan out. 
To see this, suppose for a contradiction that p is such a measure in a 
separable infinite-dimensional Banach space X .  As p is outer regular with 
respect to open sets, there is an open U c X such that 0 < p(U) < 00. 
Since X is infinite-dimensional, there are a number r > 0 and pairwise 
disjoint balls B1, Bz, . . . of radius T inside U .  As X is separable, there exist 
balls El, &, . . . of radius r so that U c u &. Hence 0 < p(U) 5 
p ( g i ) ,  
and since p is translation-invariant, we have 
- 
0 < p(B1) = p(B1) = p(B2) = p(B2) = . . . . 
Consequently, p(U) 2 
This means that we need to define null sets differently, not using a single 
measure. Here is a simple definition introduced by Christensen [4]. 
A Borel subset A of a separable Banach space X is called Huur nu12 if 
there exists a Borel probability measure p on X so that p ( A  + x) = 0 for 
all z E X .  
A translate of a Haar null set is, clearly, Haar null. The probability 
measure witnessing that a given set is null can be taken with its support 
contained in an arbitrarily small ball. Hence open sets are not null. Suppose 
that {A,} is a sequence of null sets, and that for each n the measure 
p, witnessing that A, is null is a probability measure which in the weak 
topology is “close enough” to the probability measure supported at the 
origin. Then it is not difficult to see that the convolution p1 * p2 * p3 * . . . 
witnesses that U A, is Haar null. 
p(Bi) = m, which is indeed a contradiction. 

86 
Haar null Borel sets coincide with Lebesgue null Borel sets in finite- 
dimensional Banach spaces. 
Christensen introduced this family to show that a Lipschitz function f 
defined on a separable Banach space X is Giiteaux differentiable almost 
everywhere. This means that it is differentiable outside a Haar null set, 
and so, in particular, on a dense set. 
Let us briefly sketch a proof of this, in order to understand how one uses 
null sets and finite-dimensional results to prove density results in infinite- 
dimensional spaces. 
Let {u,} be a sequence of unit vectors dense in the unit sphere of X, 
and let A, 
be the normalized Lebesgue measure supported on the unit ball 
of the span L, of (211,. . . , un}. Let A, c X be the set of all points z E X 
such that f restricted to z + L, is not differentiable at z. By Rademacher’s 
theorem, X,(A, + y) = 0 for all y E X .  Hence each A, is Haar null. It is 
not difficult to see that f is Giiteaux differentiable at every point outside 
the Haar null set A = U A,. 
There are many other notions of null sets in infinite-dimensional Banach 
spaces. Aronszajn [ I ]  and cube null sets [19] were introduced similarly 
to Haar null sets in order to prove Giiteaux differentiablity of Lipschitz 
functions, and later on turned out to be different definitions of the same 
family of sets [5]. A generalization of Aronszajn null sets and the so-called 
r-null sets [18] were introduced to examine the FrBchet differentiability of 
Lipschitz functions. Rather than going into the sometimes quite technical 
definitions of these famillies of null sets, we finish this section with a few 
simple observations about Haar null sets, in order to give the reader some 
more feeling for them. 
Any closed proper (affine) subspace L and, in particular, any hyper- 
plane, of a separable Banach space X is Haar null. To see this, it is enough 
to take u E X \ L and the normalized Lebesgue measure X on [0, u]. 
Suppose K is a compact subset of an infinite-dimensional separable 
Banach space X .  As above, we will find a point u so that any line in the 
direction of u intersects K in at most one point; the Lebesgue measure X 
on [O,u] will show that K is Haar null. As K is compact, so is its closed 
convex symmetric hull k. 
Since X is infinite-dimensional, the interior of 
k is empty. Hence, as we have seen in the first section, by Baire’s theorem, 
U nk # X. Now choose any u E X \ U ng. 
It turns out [22] that in reflexive spaces all closed convex sets with 
empty interior are Haar null; actually this is a characterization of separable 
reflexive spaces. Even in Hilbert space, however, there is a convex set 

87 
which is Haar null, but this fact is not witnessed by any measure with a 
finite dimensional support. To see this, let Q = {Caiei E & : ai 2 0) be 
the positive cone of &. Then Q is closed, convex and it has empty interior; 
hence it is Haar null by [22]. At the same time, Q contains a translate of 
the unit ball of every finite-dimensional subspace of l 2 .  
Finally, let us mention that by far not all “good” properties of Lebesgue 
null sets are shared by Haar null sets. If F : R” -+ R” is a Lipschitz 
mapping, then the image of a Lebesgue null set is a null set again. There 
exists, however, a mapping F of f$ onto itself such that both F and its 
inverse are Lipschitz, and at the same time the complement of F(A) is 
Haar null for some Haar null Bore1 set A c & [17]. 
4. Nonexpansive and contractive mappings 
Recall that a Lipschiz mapping with Lipschitz constant equal to one 
is said to be nonexpansive. Nonexpansive mapping theory has flourished 
during the last forty years or so with many results and applications. See, 
for example, [12], [13], [15], and the references mentioned therein. In con- 
trast with the iterates of nonexpansive mappings which in general do not 
converge, it is known that the iterates of contractive mappings (see the 
definition below) converge in all complete metric spaces [23]. However, it 
is also known [6] that in Banach spaces the iterates of most nonexpansive 
mappings (in the sense of Baire’s categories) do converge to their unique 
fixed points. In the next section we explain this result by showing that 
most nonexpansive mappings are, in fact, contractive [26]. As a matter of 
fact, it turns out that our result holds for all complete hyperbolic spaces, 
a notion which is of independent interest and which we now recall. 
Let (X, p )  be a metric space and let R denote the real line. We say that 
a mapping c : R -+ X is a metric embedding of R into X if p(c(s), c(t)) = 
1s - t( for all real s and t. The image of R under a metric embedding will be 
called a metric line. The image of a real interval [a, b] = {t E R : a 5 t 5 b} 
under such a mapping will be called a metric segment. Assume that (X, p )  
contains a family M of metric lines such that for each pair of distinct points 
x and y in X, there is a unique metric line in M which passes through x 
and y. This metric line determines a unique metric segment joining x and 
y. We denote this segment by [x, 
y]. For each 0 5 t 5 1, there is a unique 
point z in [x, 
y] such that p(x, z )  = tp(x, y) and p(z, y) = (1 - t)p(z, y). 
This point will be denoted by (1 - t)x @ ty. We will say that X, or more 

aa 
precisely ( X ,  p, M ) ,  is a hyperbolic space if

for all x , y  and z in X .  A set K c X is called pconvex if [z,y] c K for 
all x and y in K. It is clear that all normed linear spaces are hyperbolic. 
A discussion of more examples of hyperbolic spaces and, in particular, of 
the Hilbert ball can be found, for example, in [24]. In the sequel we will 
repeatedly use the following fact (cf. [13], pp. 77 and 104, and [24]): If 
( X ,  p, M )  is a hyperbolic space, then 
p((1 - t ) x  @ tz, (1 - t)?4 @ tw) I

Assume that ( X ,  p) is a hyperbolic complete metric space and let K be a 
bounded closed pconvex subset of X .  Denote by A the set of all operators 
A : K + K such that 
p(Ax, Ay) 5 p(x, y) for all x, y E K. 
(2) 
In other words, the set A consists of all the nonexpansive self-mappings of 
K. Set 
d(K) = SUP{P(Z,Y) : x,y E K). 
We equip the set A with the metric h(., .) defined by 
h(A, B) = sup{p(A~, Bz) 
: z E K } ,  A, B E A. 
Clearly, the metric space (A, h) is complete.

We say that a mapping A E A is contractive if there exists a decreasing

and 
(4) 
The notion of a contractive mapping, as well as its modifications and ap- 
plications, were studied by many authors. See, for example, [16]. We now 
quote a convergence result which is valid in all complete metric spaces [23]. 
Theorem 4.1. Assume that A E A is contractive. Then there exists X A  E 
K such that Anx -+ 
X A  as n -+ 
00, uniformly on K .  

89 
For each A, B E A and each a E (0, l), define the operator a A @ ( l - a ) B  
by 
(aA @ (1 - CX)B)Z 
=  AX @ (I - a)Bz, z E K. 
(5) 
Note that a A  @ (1 - a)B E A by (1). Next, we note the following simple 
fact. 
Proposition 4.1. If A E A is contractive, B E A and a E (0, l), then the 
composition operators AB, B A  and the p-convex combination aA@( l - a ) B  
are also contractive. 
5. The set of contractive mappings contains a residual 
subset 
Now we show that most of the mappings in A (in the sense of Baire's 
categories) are, in fact, contractive. 
Theorem 5.1. There exists a set 3 which is a countable intersection of 
open, dense sets in A such that each A E 3 is contractive. 
Proof. Fix B E K .  For each A E A and each y E (0, l), define A, E A by 
A,z = (1 - ~ ) A z  
@ 70, 2 E K. 
(6) 
Clearly, the set {A, : A E A, y E (0,l)) is dense in A. 
Let A E A and y E (0,l). Inequality (1) implies that 
P(A-97 A,Y) I (1 - Y ) P ( G  Y) 
U(A, 7, i) = { B  E A : h(A,, B )  < 4-2-lyd(K)}.

for all x, y E K .  For each integer i 2 1, define 
We will show that for each A E A, y E (0, l), and each integer i 2 1, the 
following property holds: 
(Pl) For each B E U(A,y,i) and each x , y  E K satisfying p(x,y) 2 
4-Zd(K), the inequality p(Bx, By) 5 (1 - 2-'y)p(x, y) is valid. 
Indeed, let A E A, y E (0, l), and let i 2 1 be an integer. Assume that 
B E U(A, y,i), x, y E K, and p(x, y) 2 4-24K).

BY (8), (9), and (7), 

90 
Thus property (Pl) holds. Now define 
3 = ngl U {U(A, y, 
q) : A E A, y E (0,1)}. 
Clearly, 3 is a countable intersection of open, dense sets in A. We claim 
that any B E 3 is contractive. To prove this, assume that q is a natural 
number. There exist A E A and y E (0,l) such that B E U(A, y,q). By 
property (Pl), for each z,y E K satisfying p(z,y) 2 4-4d(K), we have 
p(Bz, By) 5 (1 - 2-ly)p(z, g). Since q is an arbitrary natural number, we 
0 
can conclude that B is contractive. Theorem 5.1 is proved. 
A variant of Theorem 5.1 has recently been established by De Blasi and 
Pianigiani [lo] who used the Baire category method to solve the prescribed 
singular values problem with Dirichlet boundary data. We now remark in 
passing that an extension theorem of theirs, namely, Theorem 3.1 in [lo], 
can be improved. 
Theorem 5.2. Let H and L be two Halbert spaces and let D be a subset of 
H .  Then each contractive mapping A : D t L with a bounded range has a 
contractive extension B : H -+ L to all of H .  
Proof. Let A satsify (4) for all x,y E D, 
where the decreasing function 
+A : R+ 3 [0,1] satisfies (3) for all t > 0, and let v : R+ -+ R+ be its 
modulus of continuity; that is, let 
v(t) := S U ~ { ~ A X  
- Agl : Z, Y E D, 
)Z - Y) _< t}. 
Clearly, v has a bounded range and v(t) 5 t for all t E R+. 
We claim that 
v(t) < t for all positive t. Indeed, suppose v(s) = s for some s > 0. Then 
there would be sequences {xn} and {yn} in D such that 12, - y,l 
5 s for 
all n E N and limnhco (Az, - Ay,I = s. Since 
IA% - AYnI 5 $JA(I.n - Ynl)lzn - Ynl I 
1% - Ynl 5 s, 
we conclude that (z, - yn( -+ 
s and that +A(Izn - g,)) + 1 as n -+ m. 
But this means that (2, - yn) t 0, so that s = 0, which is a contradiction. 
Thus v(t) < t for all t > 0, as claimed. 
Now we can follow the argument in [lo] and obtain a concave function 
w : R+ --f R+ such that w(0) = 0, v(t) 5 w(t) for all t 2 0, and w(t) < t for 
t > 0. By the Grunbaum-Zarantonello extension theorem [14] (see also [2], 
p. 18), A has a uniformly continuous extension B : H -+ L with modulus 
of continuity o(t) 5 w(t),t 2 0. Define $B : [0, m) --f [0,1] by @(O) := 1, 
$B(t) := w(t)/t,t > 0. Then $B(t) < 1 for all t > 0 and $B is decreasing 

91 
because w(s) 2 (1 - s/t)w(O) + (s/t)w(t) = ( s / t ) w ( t ) ,  0 5 s < t, by the 
concavityofw. Also, IBz-By1 I P(lz-yl) 5 w ( l ~ - y l )  = $ B ( l ~ - ~ l ) l ~ - ~ I  
for all z, y E H .  Thus B is indeed contractive, as asserted. 
0 
Note that if A : D 4 L satisfies /Ax - Ayl < Iz - yI for z # y and D 
is compact (as assumed in [lo]), then A is necessarily contractive. This, 
however, is no longer true if D is not compact. 
6. The complement of the set of contractive mappings is 
a-porous 
In the previous section we have explained the result in [6] by showing that 
most nonexpansive mappings are, in fact, contractive. However, it is shown 
in [7] that the complement of the set of power convergent nonexpansive 
mappings is not only of the first category, but also a-porous. In this sec- 
tion we strengthen all of these results by showing that the set of all noncon- 
tractive mappings is not only of the first category, but also a-porous [28]. 
For simplicity, we will consider only self-mappings of a subset of a Banach 
space. However, just as in the previous section, our result also holds for 
the wider class of hyperbolic complete metric spaces. 
Assume that (X, 1) . ) I )  is a Banach space and let K be a bounded closed 
convex subset of X. We continue to use the notation of Section 4 with the 
understanding that p(z, y) = 1111: - yI I. 
Theorem 6.1. There exists a set 3 c A such that A \ 3 is a-porous in 
(A, h) and each A E 3 is contractive. 
Proof. For each natural number n, denote by A, the set of all A E A 
which have the following property: 
(P2) There exists K E ( 0 , l )  such that IlAz - Ayll 5 1c11z - yII for all 
z,y E K satisfying ))z - y J J  
_> d(K)(2n)-'. 
Let n 2 1 be an integer. We will show that the set A \ A, is porous in 
(A, h). To this end, set 
(u = 8-' min{d(K), 1 } ( 2 n ) - l ( d ( K )  + l)-l. 
y = 2 - ' r ( d ( ~ )  + I)-' 
A,z = ( 1  - y ) A z  + 70, z E K. 
(10) 
(11) 
(12) 
Fix 0 E K. Let A E A and r E (0,1]. Set 
and define 

92 
Clearly, A, E A, 
w,, A) I 7d(K), 
(13) 
(14) 
h(B,A,) 5 ar. 
(15) 
and for all z, y E K, 
IIA+ - ArYll I 
(1 - 7)llAz -AYll I (1 - 7)llz - YII. 
Assume that B E A and that 
We will show that B E A. 
Indeed, let 
z,y E K and I(z - Y I I  2 (2n)-'d(K). 
1111: - YII - IIA,z - ArYll 2 YllZ - YII L 7 4 K ) ( W - l .  
IIBz - BY11 I 
IlBz - A+Il + I I 4 z  - A,Yll+ I P , Y  - BY11 
(16) 
(17) 
It follows from (14) and (16) that 
BY (15), 
I llA+ - A,yll+ 2ar. 
When combined with (17), (11) and (lo), this implies that 
113: - YII - llBz - B Y l l  2 113: - YII - IlA+ - A,Yll - 2ar 
2 yd(K)(2n)-' - 2ar 
= 2-'r[(2n)-'d(K)(d(K) + 1)-' - 4a] 
2 2T1rd(K)(4n)-'(d(K) + 1)-l. 
Thus 
JJBx - By11 I 112 - yJJ - rd(K)(d(K) + 1)-'(8n)-' 
I llz - Yll(1- .(8n)-'(d(K) + I)-'). 
Since this holds for all z,y E K satisfying (16), we conclude that B E 
A,. Thus each B E A satisfying (15) belongs to A,. In other words, 
{ B  E A : h(B,A,) 5 or} C A,. 
(18) 
If B E A satisfies (15), then by (13), (lo), and (11) we have 
h(A, B) 5 h(B, A,) + h(A,, A) 5 ar + y d ( K )  5 8-'r + 2T'r 5 r. 
Thus 
{B E A : h(B, A,) I ar} C { B  E A : h(B,A) I r}. 

93 
When combined with (18), this inclusion implies that A \ A, is porous in 
(A, h). Set .F = n,",ld,. 
Clearly, A \ .F is a-porous in (A, h). In view of 
0 
property (P2), each A E F is contractive. 
Remark. If X is a Hilbert space, then the set of all strict contractions 
(that is, mappings with Lipschitz constant strictly less than one) is a-porous 
in (A, h) [7]. It would be of interest to determine if this continues to hold 
in all Banach spaces, as well as for rotative mappings [15], Chapter 11. 
Analogous results to Theorem 6.1 and to the above remark for set- 
contractions with respect to Kuratowski's measure of noncompactness were 
established in [3]. 
7. Well-posedness 
In this section we show that the fixed point problem for any contractive 
mapping is well posed [31]. Therefore Theorem 6.1 also yields Theorem 8 
in [7]. 
Let ( K ,  p) be a bounded complete metric space. We say that the fixed 
point problem for a mapping A : K ---f K is well posed if there exists a 
unique X A  E K such that AXA = X A  and the following property holds: 
if {x,},",~ c K and p(xn, Ax,) -+ 0 as n + 03, then p(x,, X A )  ---f 0 as 
n 4 03. 
The notion of well-posedness is of central importance in many areas of 
mathematics and its applications. In our context this notion was studied in 
[7], where generic well-posedness of the fixed point problem is established 
for the space of nonexpansive self-mappings of K. 
We continue to use the notation introduced in Section 4. 
Theorem 7.1. Assume that a mapping A : K -+ K is contractive. Then 
the fixed point problem for A is well posed. 
Proof. Since the mapping A is contractive, there exists a decreasing func- 
tion qbA = qb : [O,d(K)] 
-+ [0,1] such that (3) and (4) hold. By Theorem 4.1, 
there exists a unique X A  E K such that 
AXA = X A .  
(19) 
Let {x,},"=~ c K satisfy 
lim p(x,,Axn) = 0. 
n-oo 

94 
We will show that x, -+ XA as n + 00. 
Suppose this were false. By 
extracting a subsequence, if necessary, we might then assume without loss 
of generality that there exists E > 0 such that 
p(x,,xA) 1 
E for all integers n 2 1. 
(21) 
It follows then from (19), (4), (21) and the monotonicity of the function 4 
that for all integers n 2 1, 
p(xA,Zn) _< P(ZA,Azn) +p(A%,%) 
I p(Axn, zn) + 4(p(z,, Z A ) ) P ( G ,  %A) 
(22) 
I p(Azn, 2,) + +(E)P(ZA, xn). 
Inequalities (22) and (21) imply that for all integers n 2 1, 
E ( 1  - 4(E)) 5 (1 - 4(E))P(xA,xn) 5 p(Axn,xn), 
a contradiction (see (20)). The contradiction we have reached proves The- 
orem 7.1.

8. Strict contractions 
Let K be a nonempty, bounded, closed and convex subset of a Banach space 
( X ,  II . 11). Set 
rad(K) = sup(llx1l : x E K } .  
LiP(A) = sup{llAz - AYIlAb - YII : Z,Y E K, x # Y} 
(23) 
(24) 
For each A : K -+ X ,  let 
be the Lipschitz constant of A. We continue to denote by d the set of all 
nonexpansive mappings A : K -+ K ,  that is, all self-mappings of K with 
Lip(A) 5 1, or equivalently, all self-mappings of K which satisfy 
llAx - Ayll 5 llx - yII for all x,y E K. 
(25) 
We say that a self-mapping A : K -+ K is a strict contraction if Lip(A) < 1. 
We have already seen that although the set of all strict contractions in 
the space (d,h) 
is small, the set of power convergent nonexpansive map- 
pings is large. 
In Sections 5, 6 and 7 we have singled out a property (that of being 
contractive), which on the one hand turns out to be possessed by most 
nonexpansive mappings and on the other ensures power convergence to 
unique fixed points as well as well-posedness of the fixed point problem. 

95 
It may seem strange that the set of contractive mappings is large while 
the set of strict contractions is small. Needless to say, the answer to the 
question whether a certain set is small or large depends on the metric 
(topology) under consideration. Indeed, in this section we show that if the 
space A is endowed with another natural complete metric, then the set of 
strict contractions is, in fact, large [32]. Our new metric is defined by 
d(A,B) = sup{llAz - BzlJ : z E K }  +Lip(A - B), 
(26) 
where A, B E A. It is not difficult to see that the metric space (A, d) is 
complete. 
Theorem 8.1. Denote by 3 the set of all strict contractions A E A. Then 
A \ 3 is porous. 
Proof. Fix a number Q > 0 such that 
Q < (1 + 2rad(K))-l32-l 
y = (1 + 2rad(K))-lr/S 
(27) 
(28) 
A,z=(l-y)Az+yB, 
X E K .  
(29) 
(30) 
and fix 0 E K .  Let A E A and let r E (0,1]. Set 
and put 
Clearly, A, E A and for each z, y E K ,  
IlA+ - 4 V l l  = (1 - r)llAz - AYll I 
(1 - 7)Ilz - YII. 
I J A , ~  
- A ~ J I  
= 11(i - r ) ~ z  
+ye - ~ z l l  
= rile - ~ z l l  
By (29), (23), (24) and (26), for each z E K ,  
I2yrad(K), 

96 
We now assume that B E A and that 
d(B,A,) 5 ar. 
(33) 
In view of (33), (26), (30) and (28), we see that 
Lip(B) ILip(A,) + Lip(B - AY) 5 Lip(A,) + d ( B ,  A,) 
ILip(A,) + ar 5 (1 - y) + ar I 1 - (r/8)(1+ 2rad(K))-' 
+ r(32(1+ 2rad(K))-l I 
1 - (r/16)(1+ 2rad(K))-l < 1, 
and so B E F. Clearly, by (33), (32) and (27), 
d(B, A) 5 d(B, AY) + d(A,, A) I ar + r/8 I r. 
Thus for each B E A satisfying (33), B E F and d(B,A) 5 r. This 
0 
completes the proof of Theorem 8.1.

Absolute-valued algebras are fully surveyed. Some attention is also payed to Bai 
nach spaces underlying complete absolute-valued algebras. 
Introduction 
Absolute-valued algebras are defined as those real or complex algebras A 
satisfying 11zy/11 = IIzlIIIy/I] for a given norm 1) . 11 on A, and all z,y E A. 
Despite the nice simplicity of the above definition, absolute-valued alge- 
bras have not attracted the attention of too many people. A reason could 
be that, in the presence of associativity, the axiom (1xyll = llxllIlyll is ex- 
tremely obstructive. Indeed, according to an old theorem of S. Mazur 66, 
there are only three absolute-valued associative real algebras. Nevertheless, 
when associativity is removed, absolute-valued algebras do exist in abun- 
dance. Some facts corroborating the above assertion are that every complete 
normed algebra is isometrically algebra-isomorphic to a quotient of a com- 
plete absolute-valued algebra (Corollary 3.2), and that every Banach space is 
linearly isometric to a subspace of a complete absolute-valued algebra (The- 
orem 5.1). Anyway, the quantity and quality of works on absolute-valued 
algebras seemed to us enough to deserve a detailed survey paper like the 
one we are just beginning. 
Our paper collects the results on absolute-valued algebras since the pi- 
oneering works of Ostrowski 75, Mazur 66, Albert ' 
3 ,  and Wright log (see 
Subsection 1.3) to the more recent developments. The inflexion point in the

theory, namely the Urbanik-Wright paper lo6, is fully reviewed (see Subsec- 
tions 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, and 3.1). Among the recent developments, we emphasize 
the solution 57 to Albert's old problem 
if every absolute-valued algebraic 
algebra is finite-dimensional (see Subsection 2.7), and the study of Banach 
spaces underlying complete absolute-valued algebras, done in 
and 69 (see 
Section 5). A special attention is also payed to the intermediate works of 
K. Urbanik (lol to lo4) and M. L. El-Mallah (35 to 46). This is done in 
Subsections 2.4, 2.5, 2.7, 3.1, 3.2, and 3.4. Contributions of other authors 
(including the one of this paper) are also reviewed (see mainly Subsec- 
tions 1.4, 2.6, 3.5, and 3.6, and the whole Section 4). The clarifications of 
the theory at some precise points, done by Gleichgewicht 49 and Elduque- 
P6rez 331 are inserted in the appropriate places (see Subsection 3.4, and 
Subsections 1.3, 2.1, and 3.5, respectively). Our paper contains also some 
new results, and several new proofs of known results. Known proofs have 
been included only when they seemed to us specially illuminating. 
As far as we know, absolute-valued algebras have been surveyed in exclu- 
sive several times (see 86, 'l, and 'lo), but in references not easily available, 
and never in English. Moreover, references 91 and 'lo are relatively short, 
and references 
and 'lo become today rather obsolete. On the other hand, 
there are also survey papers on more general topics, devoting to absolute- 
valued algebras some attention (see 87 and 88). Finally, let us note that 
the Ph. Theses 35, 63, and 78 are devoted to absolute-valued algebras, and 
contain both reviews of other people's results and proofs of results of their 
respective authors. 
1. Finite-dimensional absolute-valued algebras 
1.1. Some basic definitions and facts 
By an algebra over a field F we mean a vector space A over F endowed 
with a bilinear mapping (x, y) -+ xy from A x A to A called the product 
of the algebra A. Algebras in this paper are assumed to be nonzero, but 
are not assumed to be associative, nor to have a unit element. We suppose 
that the reader is familiarized with the basic terminology in the theory 
of algebras. Thus, terms as subalgebra, ideal, or algebra homomorphism 
are not defined here. For an element x in an algebra A, we denote by L, 
(respectively, R,) the operator of left (respectively, right) multiplication 
by x on A. The algebra A is said to be a division algebra if, for every 
nonzero element 2 of A, the operators L, and R, are bijective. An algebra 
is said to be alternative if it satisfies the identities xfx2 = x1(x1x2) and 

101 
( 2 1 2 2 ) 2 2  = x ~ x g .  We note that alternative algebras are “very nearly” 
associative. Indeed, by Artin’s theorem (see Theorem 2.3.2 of ‘13), the 
subalgebra generated by two arbitrary elements of an alternative algebra 
is associative. It is also worth mentioning that every alternative division 
algebra has a unit (see page 226 of 31). By an algebra involution on an 
algebra A we mean an involutive linear operator x -+ 
x* on A satisfying 
(zy)* = g*x* for all x,y E A. 
Now, let K denote the field of real or complex numbers. An alge- 
bra norm (respectively, absolute value) on an algebra A over K is a 
norm 11 . I( on the vector space of A satisfying llxyll 5 IIxlI ((yI( (respectively, 
llzy[l = Ilxl[[[y[() 
for all x,y E A. By a normed (respectively, absolute- 
valued) algebra we mean an algebra over IK endowed with an algebra 
norm (respectively, absolute value). We note that absolute-valued jnite- 
dimensional algebras are division algebras. We also note that, if there ex- 
ists an absolute value on a finite-dimensional algebra A over K, 
then we 
can speak about “the” absolute value of A, understanding that such an 
absolute value is the unique possible one on A. This is a straightforward 
consequence of the easy and well-known result immediately below. The 
proof we are giving here is taken from 26. 
Proposition 1.1. Let A be a normed algebra over K, 
let B be an absolute- 
valued algebra over K, 
and let $ : A + B be a continuous algebra homo- 
morphism. Then $ is in fact contractive. 
Proof. Assume to the contrary that q5 is not contractive. Then we can 
choose a norm-one element z in A such that Il$(x)l[ > 1. Defining induc- 
tively 2 1  := x and x,+1 := xi, we have 11$(x,)1) = 11q5(x)112n-1 4 00 . 
0 
Since Ilxnll 5 1, this contradicts the assumed continuity of $. 
Looking at the above proof, we realize that Proposition 1.1 remains true 
if B is only assumed to be a normed algebra over K satisfying ((y2(( 
= ( ( ~ 1 1 ~  
for every y E B, and 4 : A -+ B is only assumed to be a continuous linear 
mapping preserving squares. As a consequence of Proposition 1,1, every 
continuous algebra involution on an absolute-valued algebra is isometric. 
Let A be a normed algebra. An element z of A is said to be a left 
(respectively, right) topological divisor of zero in A if there exists a 
sequence { x n }  of norm-one elements of A such that {xz,} 4 0 (respec- 
tively, {z,x} + 0). Elements of A which are left or right (respectively, 
both left and right) topological divisors of zero in A are called one-sided 

102 
(respectively, two-sided) topological divisors of zero in A. The ele- 
ment IC E A is said to be a joint topological divisor of zero in A if there 
exists a sequence {zn} of norm-one elements of A such that {xzn} -+ 0 and 
{xnx} -+ 0. We note that both absolute-valued algebras and normed division 
alternative algebras have no one-sided topological divisor of zero other than 
zero. (This is clear in the case of absolute-valued algebras, and is easily 
verified in the case of normed division alternative algebras, by keeping in 
mind the fact already pointed out that division alternative algebras have a 
unit element, and applying the properties of “invertible” elements of unital 
alternative algebras given in page 38 of 94.) We will review in Theorem 1.1 
a much deeper fact implying that, conversely, normed alternative algebras 
without nonzero joint topological divisors of zero are division algebras. 
1.2. Quaternions and Octonions 
Surveying absolute-valued algebras, we should write something about the 
algebra W of Hamilton’s Quaternions, and the algebra 0 
of Octonions 
(also called “Cayley numbers”). These algebras, together with the fields 
of real and complex numbers (denoted by R and C, respectively), become 
the basic examples of absolute-valued algebras. The algebras C, W, 
and 0 
can be built from R by iterating the so-called “Cayley-Dickson doubling 
process” (see for example pages 256-257 of 31). Thus, if A stands for either 
R, @, or MI, and if * denotes the standard algebra involution of A (which, for 
A = R, is nothing other than the identity mapping), then we can consider 
the real vector space A x A with the product given by 
(21,52)(2.3,24) 
:= (51x3 - - 4 x a , x T 2 4  + 2 3 x 2 )  7 
obtaining in this way a new real algebra which is a copy of either 6, 
H, 
or 0, 
respectively. In this doubling process, the standard involution * and 
the absolute value 11 . I( of the new algebra are related to the corresponding 
ones of the starting algebra by the formulae 
respectively. It follows from the last formula that the absolute values of 
R, C, W ,  and 0 come from inner products. It is also of straightforward 
verification that the algebra W is associative but not commutative, whereas 
the algebra 0 
is alternative but not associative. 
The joint introduction of IHI and 0 
done above is surely the quickest pos- 
sible one. However, concerning W, there is another more natural approach. 

103 
Indeed, in the same way as C can be rediscovered as the subalgebra of the 
algebra M2(R) (of all 2 x 2 matrices over R) given by 
W can be rediscovered as the real subalgebra of Mz(C) 
given by 
(see for example page 195 of 31). Regarded W in this new way, the standard 
involution of W corresponds with the transposition of matrices, and the 
absolute value of an element of W is nothing other than the nonnegative 
square root of its (automatically nonnegative) determinant. 
The algebras MI and 0 
are very far from being only exotic objects in 
Mathematics. By the contrary, they solve many natural problems in the 
field of the Algebra, the Geometry, and the Mathematical Analysis. Thus, 
as a consequence of the Robenius-Zorn theorem (see for example pages 229 
and 262 of 31), R, C, MI, and 0 are the unique finite-dimensional alternative 
division real algebras. On the other hand, we have the following. 
Theorem 1.1. Every normed alternative real algebra without nonzero joint 
topological divisors of zero is algebra-isomorphic to either R, C, W, 
or 0. 
Theorem 1.1 has been proved by M. L. El-Mallah and A. Micali 45 by apply- 
ing the forerunner of I. Kaplansky 6o (see also 17) for associative algebras. 
Keeping in mind the uniqueness of the absolute value on a finite-dimensional 
algebra, pointed out in Subsection 1.1, it follows that R, C, W, and 0 are 
the unique absolute-valued alternative real algebras. A refinement of the fact 
just formulated (see Theorem 2.4) and other interesting characterizations 
of R, C, W, 
and 0 (see Theorems 2.1, 2.5, 2.6, and 3.4) will be reviewed 
later. The reader interested in increasing his knowledge on Quaternions 
and Octonions is referred to the books 22 and 31, and the survey papers 
and 98. These works and references therein will provide him with a complete 
panoramic view of the topic. Nevertheless, let us emphasize the abundance 
of historical notes and mathematical remarks collected in 31, and take some 
samples of them. 
Thus, in a note written with the occasion of the fifteenth birthday of 
the Quaternions, W. R. Hamilton says: “They [the Quaternions] started 
into life, or light, full grown, on the 16th of October, 1843, as I was walking 
with Lady Hamilton to Dublin, and came up to Brougham Bridge.” (see 

104 
page 191 of 31). It turns out also curious to know that Hamilton tried for 
many years to built a three dimensional division associative real algebra. In 
fact, shortly before his death in 1865 he wrote to his son: “Every morning, 
on my coming down to breakfast, you used to ask me: ‘Well, Papa, can 
you multiply triplets?’ Whereto I was always obliged to reply, with a sad 
shake of the head: ‘No, I can only add and subtract them’.’’ (see page 189 
of 31). It is not less curious how, in a very elemental way, one can realize 
that the attempt of Hamilton just quoted could not be successful. Indeed, 
refining slightly the content of the footnote in page 190 of 31, we have the 
following. 
Proposition 1.2. Let A be a (possibly nonassociative) division real algebra 
of odd dimension. Then A has dimension 1, and hence it is isomorphic to R. 
Proof. Fix y E A\ {0}, and let x be in A. Then the characteristic polyno- 
mial of the operator LY1 o L, must have a real root (say A), which becomes 
an eigenvalue of such an operator. Taking a corresponding eigenvector 
z # 0, we have (z - Xy)z = 0, which implies z = Xy. Since 2 is arbitrary 
0 
in A, we have A = R y .  
We note that the above proof is nothing other than a natural variant of 
the usual one for the fact that finite-dimensional division algebras over an 
algebraically closed field IF are isomorphic to IF. 
According to the information collected in page 249 of 31, the Octonions 
were discovered by J. T. Graves in December 1843, only two months af- 
ter the birth of the Quaternions. Graves communicated his discovery to 
Hamilton in a letter dated 4th January 1844, but did not publish it until 
1848. In the meantime, just in 1845, the Octonions were rediscovered by A. 
Cayley, who published his result immediately. For a more detailed history 
of the discovery of Octonions the reader is referred to pages 146-147 of 6. 
1.3. The pioneering work of Ostrowski, Mazur, Albert, and 
Wright 
We already know that R, @, W, and 0 are the unique absolute-valued 
alternative real algebras. As a consequence, B, 
@, and W are the unique 
absolute-valued associative real algebras (a fact first proved by S. Mazur 66). 
More particularly, we have the following. 
Proposition 1.3. Let A be a n  absolute-valued, associative, and commuta- 
tive algebra over R. Then A is isometrically isomorphic to either R or @. 

1 05 
Proof. Since A is an integral domain, we can consider the field of fractions 
of A (say IF), and extend (in the unique possible way) the absolute value of 
A to an absolute value on IF. Now IF is an absolute-valued field extension 
of R, and hence it is isometrically isomorphic to R or C (see Lemma 1.1 
0 
below). Since A is a subalgebra of IF, the result follows. 
According to the information collected in pages 243 and 245 of 31, the 
above proposition and proof are due to A. Ostrowski 75, who seems to have 
been the first mathematician considering absolute-valued algebras as ab- 
stract objects which are worth being studied. The following lemma (today 
a consequence of the famous Gelfand-Mazur theorem) is also due to him. 
Lemma 1.1. Every absolute-valued field extension of R is isometrically 
isomorphic to either R or @. 
The first paper dealing with absolute-valued algebras in a general nonas- 
sociative setting is the one of A. A. Albert 2, who proves as main result the 
following. 
Proposition 1.4. R, C, W, and 0 are the unique absolute-valued finite- 
dimensional real algebras with a unit. 
A surprisingly short proof of Proposition 1.4, based on early works of 
H. Auerbach 
and A. Hurwitz 53, can be given. However, since such a 
proof was not noticed by Albert, nor by anybody at his time, we prefer 
to postpone it until the conclusion of Subsection 2.2, and continue here 
with the chronological narration of facts. As we will see in Proposition 1.6 
below, Proposition 1.4 was refined shorty later by Albert himself. Thus, 
the actual interest of Albert’s paper 
relies on both the introduction of the 
notion of “isotopy” between absolute-valued algebras, and the proof of the 
following proposition. 
Proposition 1.5. Let A be an absolute-valued finite-dimensional real alge- 
bra. Then A is isotopic to either R, 
C, W, or 0. Therefore A has dimension 
1,2,4, or 8, and the absolute-value of A comes from an inner product. 
According to Albert’s definition, two absolute-valued algebras A and 
B over K are said to be isotopic if there exist linear isometries 4 1 , 4 2 , 4 3  
from A onto B satisfying & ( z y )  = # Q ( x ) ~ ~ ( Y )  
for all z , y  in A. Albert 
derives Proposition 1.5 from Proposition 1.4 in a clever but quite simple 
way. Indeed, choosing a norm-one element a E A, and defining a new 
product 0 
on the normed space of A by say := R;’(z)L;’(y), 
we obtain 

106 
a finite-dimensional absolute-valued algebra, which is isotopic to A and 
has a unit (namely, a2). The argument just reviewed has been recently 
refined in the paper of A. Elduque and J. M. PQrez 33, yielding Lemma 1.2 
immediately below. As we will see later, such a lemma has turned out to 
be very useful in the theory. 
Lemma 1.2. Let A be an absolute-valued algebra over K such that there 
exist a, b E A satisfying a A  = Ab = A. Then A is isotopic to an absolute- 
valued algebra over K having a unit element. 
Proof. We may assume that llall = llbll = 1. Then, defining a new product 
0 on the normed space of A by z 0 
y := Rb1(z)L;'(y), we obtain an 
absolute-valued algebra over K, which is isotopic to A, and has a unit 
(namely, ab). 
0 
Concerning the assertion in Proposition 1.5 about the dimension of 
absolute-valued finite-dimensional real algebras, it is worth mentioning 
that, some years after Albert's paper 
(just in 1958), it was proved the 
following. 
Theorem 1.2. Every finite-dimensional division real algebra has dimen- 
sion 1,2,4, or 8. 
The paternity of Theorem 1.2 seems to be rather questioned. Indeed, 
according to 31, 48, and 6 ,  such a theorem was first proved by Kervaire 
and Milnor 68, Adams l, and Kervaire 62 and Bott-Milnor 13, respectively. 
Anyway, in contrast with the case of Proposition 1.2, all known proofs of 
Theorem 1.2 are extremely deep. 
A second paper of Albert 
contains as main result the following refine- 
ment of Proposition 1.4. 
Proposition 1.6. Let A be an absolute-valued algebraic real algebra with 
a unit. Then A is equal to either R, C, W, 
or 0. 
We recall that an algebra A is called algebraic if all single-generated 
subalgebras of A are finite-dimensional. As we will see later, Proposition 1.6 
has been also refined, in two different directions, and at two very distant 
dates (see Theorems 2.1 and 2.11). Therefore, Proposition 1.6 has today 
the unique interest of having been, some years later, one of the key tools in 
the original proofs of more relevant results in the theory of absolute-valued 
algebras. Among these results, we limit ourselves for the moment to review 
the one of F. B. Wright log which follows. 

107 
Theorem 1.3. An absolute-valued algebra over iK is finite-dimensional if 
(and only i f )  it is a division algebra. 
Albert’s paper 
also contains the particular case of Theorem 1.3 that 
absolute-valued algebraic division algebras are finite-dimensional. However, 
the proof given in 
for this result seems to us not to be correct. To 
conclude the present section, let us note that Propositions 1.3 and 1.6, and 
Theorem 1.3 above become “ap6ritifs” for Section 2 below. 
1.4. Classification 
For A equal to either C, W, or 0, 
let us denote by A, *A, 
and A* the 
absolute-valued real algebras obtained by endowing the normed space of 
A with the products x @ y := x*y*, x 0 
y := x*y, and x @ y := xy*, 
respectively, where * means the standard involution. It follows easily from 
Proposition 1.5 that C, C, *C, 
and C* are the unique absolute-valued two- 
dimensional real algebras. Therefore, to be provided with a classification 
(up to algebra isomorphisms) of all finite-dimensional absolute-valued real 
algebras, it would be enough to obtain such a classification in dimension 
4 and 8. Whereas for dimension 8 the problem seems to remain open, the 
case of dimension 4 has been solved in the paper of M. I. Ramirez 77, by 
applying Proposition 1.5 and the description of all linear isometries on W 
(see page 215 of 31). To this end, the so-called principal isotopes of 
W are considered. These are the absolute-valued real algebras W l ( a ,  b), 
Wz(a, b), W3(a, b), and &(a, b) obtained from fixed norm-one elements a, b 
in W by endowing the normed space of W with the products x 0 
y := axyb, 
z 0 
y := ax*y*b, x @ y := x*ayb, and x 0 
y := axby*, respectively. Then it 
is proved the following. 
Proposition 1.7. E v e y  four-dimensional absolute-valued real algebra is 
isomorphic to a principal isotope of W. Moreover two principal isotopes 
Wi(a, b) and Wj(a’, b’) of H are isomorphic if and only if i = j and the 
equalities a‘p = &pa and b‘p = Spb hold for some norm-one element p E W 
and some E,S E (1, -1). 
* 
Proposition 1.7 can be also derived from ”. 
A refinement of it can 
be found in 19. The paper 77 also contains a precise description of all 
four-dimensional absolute-valued real algebras with a left unit, as well as 
many examples of four-dimensional absolute-valued algebras containing no 
two-dimensional subalgebra. 

108 
Eight-dimensional absolute-valued real algebras with a left unit have 
been systematically studied in the recent paper of A. Rochdi 79. As a first 
basic result, Rochdi proves the following. 
Proposition 1.8. The finite-dimensional absolute-valued real algebras with 
a left unit are precisely those of the form A,, where A stands for either R, 
@, IHI, or 0, p : A -+ A is a linear isometry fixing 1, and A, denotes the 
absolute-valued real algebra obtained by endowing the normed space of A 
with the product x 0 
y := cp(x)y. Moreover, given linear isometries cp, 4 : 
A 4 A fixing 1, the algebras A, and A4 are isomorphic if and only if there 
exists an algebra automorphism $ of A satisfying 4 = $ 0  cp 0 $-’. 
It is proved also in 79 that, for A and cp as in Proposition 1.8, sub- 
algebras of A, 
and cp-invariant subalgebras of A coincide. Moreover, a 
linear isometry p : 0 -+ 0 fixing 1 can be built in such a way that 0 
has no four-dimensional pinvariant subalgebra. It follows that there exist 
eight-dimensional absolute-valued real algebras with a left unit, containing 
no four-dimensional subalgebra. Such algebras are characterized, among 
all eight-dimensional absolute-valued real algebras with a left unit, by the 
triviality of their groups of automorphisms. Such algebras seem to become 
the first examples of eight-dimensional division real algebras containing no 
four-dimensional subalgebra. 
In Subsection 3.4 we will review in detail the results concerning those 
absolute-valued real algebras A endowed with an isometric algebra involu- 
tion * which is different from the identity operator and satisfies xx* = x*x 
for every x E A. In the finite-dimensional case, such algebras have been 
classified in 
The classification theorem has a flavour similar to that of 
Proposition 1.8. 
Right Moufang algebras are defined as those algebras satisfying the 
identity x ~ ( ( x I x ~ ) x ~ )  
= ( ( x ~ x I ) x ~ ) x ~ .  
Absolute-valued right Moufang al- 
gebras are considered by J. A. Cuenca, M. I. Ramirez, and E. SBnchez 24, 
who show that such algebras are finite-dimensional. More precisely, they 
prove Theorem 1.4 immediately below. The formulation of such a theorem 
involves the notation introduced in Proposition 1.8 above, as well as the 
result of N. Jacobson 55 that both IHI and 0 have an “essentially” unique 
involutive automorphism different from the identity operator. 
Theorem 1.4. The absolute-valued right Moufang real algebras are R, @, 
IHI, 0, 
*@, and the algebras A,, where A stands for either JHI or 0, and cp 
denotes the essentially unique involutive automorphism of A different from 

109 
the identity operator. 
2. Conditions on absolute-valued algebras leading to the 
finite dimension 
2.1. The noncommutative Urbanik- Wright theorem 
Despite the constant scarcity of works on absolute-valued algebras along 
the history, a relatively short paper of K. Urbanik and F. B. Wright lo6, 
appeared in 1960 and announced the same year in lo5, attracted the atten- 
tion of many people because of the nice simplicity of its powerful results. 
In fact, Urbanik-Wright theorems have become the key tools in the later 
development of the theory of absolute-valued algebras. The first surprising 
result in the Urbanik-Wright paper is the following. 
Theorem 2.1. For an absolute-valued real algebra A, the following condi- 
tions are equivalent: 
(1) There exists a E A \ (0) satisfying a x  = xu, a(ax) = a2x, and 
(2) A has a unit element. 
(3) A is equal to either R, 
@, W, or 0. 
(xu). = xu2 for evenJ x E A. 
We shall call the crucial implication (2) 3 (3) in Theorem 2.1 above 
the noncommutative Urbanik-Wright theorem. Such a theorem 
immediately “works havoc” in the theory. For instance, it follows from 
it, and Albert’s ideas about isotopes, that an absolute-valued algebra A 
over R is finite-dimensional if (and only if) there exists a E A satisfying 
aA = Aa = A. This refinement of Wright’s Theorem 1.3 attains a bet- 
ter form whenever Lemma 1.2 replaces Albert’s ideas. Thus we have the 
following. 
Theorem 2.2. An absolute-valued algebra A over K is jinite-dimensional 
if (and only if) there exist a, b E A satisfying aA = Ab = A. 
Even, applying an easy argument of completion (see 26 for details), we 
derive from Theorem 2.2 a still better form of Theorem 1.3. Indeed, an 
absolute-valued algebra A is finite-dimensional if (and only if) there exist 
a, b E A such that aA and Ab are dense in A. Theorem 2.2 was first proved 
by the author 85 with other techniques. The proof given here is taken from 
the Elduque-P6rez paper 33. 

110 
2.2, Kaplansky 's prophetic proof of the noncommutative 
Urbanik- Wright theorem 
Concerning the proof of the noncommutative Urbanik-Wright theorem, the 
interested reader could go into the original paper lo6 to see how Urbanik and 
Wright apply, to commutative subspaces, Schoenberg 's characterization 95 
of pre-Hilbert spaces as those normed spaces X satisfying 
2 
115 + Y1I2 + 112 - Yll 2 4 
for all norm-one elements z , y  E X (see Remark 2.1 later), and how then, 
after some technical arguments, they show that the algebra satisfies the 
requirements in Albert's Proposition 1.6. However, it seems to us more 
instructive to sketch how a proof of the noncommutative Urbanik-Wright 
theorem can be tackled by the light of the present knowledge. 
Actually, the proof of the noncommutative Urbanik-Wright theorem can 
be divided into two parts. The first one, of a purely analytic type, consists in 
realizing that absolute-values on unital algebras come from inner products. 
This question was completely clarified twenty years ago. Indeed, it is easy 
to show that unital absolute-valued algebras become particular cases of the 
so-called smooth-normed algebras (see the proof of (b) + (a) in Corollary 29 
of 82), and it follows from Theorem 27 of 82 that the norm of every smooth- 
normed algebra derives from an inner product (see also Section 2 of 84 for a 
considerable simplification of the arguments in 82). We recall that a normed 
space X over K is said to be smooth at a norm-one element z E X if the 
closed unit ball of X has a unique tangent real hyperplane at z, and that 
smooth-normed algebras are defined as those normed algebras A over 
K having a norm-one unit 1 such that the normed space of A is smooth 
at 1. Incidentally, we note that C is the unique smooth-normed complex 
algebra, and that R, C, W, 
and 0 
are the unique smooth-normed alternative 
real algebras (see 82 and 84, and references therein). We also remark that 
other arguments of more autonomous nature, showing as well that unital 
absolute-valued algebras are pre-Hilbert spaces, have been found later by 
El-Mallah 40 and the author 85 (see Theorems 3.2 and 3.5, respectively). 
Now that we know that absolute values on unital algebras over K derive 
from inner products, the second (and last) part of the suggested proof of the 
noncommutative Urbanik-Wright theorem (now of a purely algebraic type) 
begins with an easy observation. Indeed, if an absolute value on a (possibly 
nonunital) real algebra A comes from an inner product, then we are pro- 
vided with a nondegenerate quadratic form q on A (namely, the mapping 
z -+ llzl12) satisfying q(sy) = q(z)q(y) for all z, y E A. In this way, we nat- 

111 
urally meet the so-called composition algebras, and the problem of classi- 
fying them. This problem was already considered and solved by Hurwitz 53 
under the additional requirements of finite dimension and existence of a 
unit. Later Kaplansky “ proved that the assumption of finite dimension 
in Hurwitz’s theorem is superfluous (see also Chapter 2 of ‘13). Applying 
the Hurwitz-Kaplansky theorem, we obtain that the unique unital com- 
position real algebras are R, C, R2 (with coordinate-wise multiplication), 
MI, M2(R), 0, 
and a certain eight-dimensional alternative nonassociative 
algebra 0’ 
which (as for the case of R2 and M2(R)) has nonzero divisors of 
zero. Since this last pathology is prevented in the case of absolute-valued 
algebras, the proof of the noncommutative Urbanik-Wright theorem is then 
concluded. 
just quoted, which was published seven years before 
the one of Urbanik and Wright, Kaplansky prophesies both the noncom- 
mutative Urbanik-Wright theorem and a proof similar to that we have 
sketched above. Even, it seems that he thinks that the noncommutative 
Urbanik-Wright theorem was already proved at that time. Thus, he says 
that “Wright log succeeded in removing the assumption [in Albert’s Propo- 
sition 1.61 that the algebra is algebraic”. Since we know that the above 
assertion is not right, we continue reproducing Kaplansky’s words with 
the appropriate corrections and explanations: “Wright proceeds by prov- 
ing that the norm [of a unital absolute-valued DIVISION algebra] springs 
from an inner product [see Lemma 3.2 later], and then that the algebra is 
algebraic. ... Thus Albert’s finite-dimensional theorem [i.e., Proposition 
1.41 can be proved by combining Wright’s result with Hurwitz’s classical 
theorem on quadratic forms admitting composition [see also Proof of Propo- 
sition 1.4 below]”. Immediately, Kaplansky motivates his work by saying 
that “The main purpose of this paper is to make a similar method possible 
in the infinite-dimensional case by providing a suitable generalization of 
Hurwitz’s theorem.” 
Concerning the proof of the noncommutative Urbanik-Wright theorem 
just sketched, let us also comment that, really, the two parts in which we 
have divided it overlap somewhat. This is so because the proofs of the 
results in 82, 40, and 85, implying that unital absolute-valued algebras are 
pre-Hilbert spaces, give simultaneously a rich algebraic information, which 
is also provided by a part of the proof of the Hurwitz-Kaplansky theo- 
rem. In fact, with such an additional information in mind, the proof of the 
noncommutative Urbanik-Wright theorem can be concluded by applying 
the Frobenius-Zorn theorem instead of the one of Hurwitz-Kaplansky (see 
In the paper 

112 
Remark 31 of s2 and Remark 4 of s5 for details). 
To conclude the present subsection, let us show how actually Albert 
could have derived his Proposition 1.4 from Hurwitz’s theorem, if he were 
aware of a result of Auerbach (see also Theorem 9.5.1 of ”) implying that 
finite-dimensional transitive normed spaces are Hilbert spaces. We recall 
that a normed space X is called transitive if, given arbitrary norm-one 
elements z, y E X ,  there exists a surjective linear isometry T : X + X such 
that T ( z )  = y. The notion of transitivity just introduced will be revisited 
more quietly in Subsection 5.1. 
Proof of Proposition 1.4. Let A be an absolute-valued algebra over K. 
If A is a division algebra, then the normed space of A is transitive, since for 
all norm-one elements x,y E A we have T(z) = y, where T := LRG~(vl 
is 
a surjective linear isometry on A. Therefore, when A is finite-dimensional, 
Auerbach’s result applies, giving that the norm of A comes from an inner 
product. Finally, if R = R, 
if A is finite-dimensional, and if A has a unit, 
then A is equal to either R, 
@, W, 
or 0 
(by Hurwitz’s theorem). 0 
The argument in the above proof is taken from page 156 of 6 ,  where 
no reference to the works of Albert and Auerbach is done. In fact, Propo- 
sition 1.4 appears as Theorem 1 of 6 ,  and is directly attributed there to 
Hurwitz 53, including shorty later the above argument as a part of the 
complete proof of such Hurwitz’s theorem. We do not agree with this at- 
tribution. Indeed, as far as we know, the observation that absolute-valued 
division algebras have transitive normed spaces appears first in the proof of 
Lemma 4 of Wright’s paper log (fifty five years after Hurwitz’s paper). On 
the other hand, Aurbach’s result, published thirty six years after Hurwitz’s 
paper, seems to us non obvious. 
2.3. The commutative Urbanik- Wright theorem 
The second surprising result in the Urbanik-Wright paper lo6 is the follow- 
ing. 
Theorem 2.3. R, C, and 
real algebras. 
are the unique absolute-valued commutative 
We shall call Theorem 2.3 above the commutative Urbanik-Wright 
theorem. We know no proof of Theorem 2.3 other than the original one 
in lo6. Starting with a new application of Schoenberg’s theorem 95, such a 
proof is really clever and easy. Therefore we do not resist the temptation of 
reproducing it here. Some unnecessary complications are of course avoided. 

113 
Proof. Let A be an absolute-valued commutative real algebra. Since for 
all norm-one elements z, y E A we have 
2 
4 = 411zYll = II(. + d2 - (. - Y)"I i 112 + Y1I2 + 1 1 %  - YII 
7 
Schoenberg's theorem applies giving that A is a pre-Hilbert space. On the 
other hand, since R, @, and @ are the unique absolute-valued commutative 
real algebras of dimension 5 2 (see Subsection 1.4), it is enough to show 
that the dimension of A is 5 2. Assume to the contrary that we can 
find pair-wise orthogonal norm-one elements u,w,w in A. Then we have 
11u2 - v211 = IIu +v1111u - 1111 = 2. Since llu211 = 11v211 = 1, the parallelogram 
law implies that u2+v2 = 0. Analogously, we obtain u2+w2 = v2+w2 = 0. 
* 
It follows u2 = 0, and hence also u = 0, a contradiction. 
With the help of Lemma 2.4 below, the commutative Urbanik-Wright 
theorem can be refined as follows. There is a universal constant K > 0 such 
that every absolute-valued real algebra A satisfying llzy - yzll 5 Kllzllllyll 
for all z, y E A is in fact equal to either R, @, or 
(see Corollary 1.4 of 59). 
Remark 2.1. For a normed space X over K, consider the property P which 
follows: 
( P )  There exists a normed space Y over R, together with a bilinear 
mapping (a,b) + ab from X x X to Y satisfying ab = ba and 
llabll = llall llbll for all a, b E X. 
Arguing as in the beginning of the proof of Theorem 2.3, we see that, if the 
normed space X satisfies Property P, then X is a pre-Hilbert space. The 
converse is also true (see Theorem 4.4 of 8). 
2.4. Power-associativity 
Let A be an algebra over a field IF. We say that A is of bounded degree if 
there exists a natural number n such that all single-generated subalgebras 
of A have dimension 5 n, and power-associative if all single-generated 
subalgebras of A are associative. In the case that the characteristic of IF is 
different from 2, we will consider the algebra A" whose vector space is the 
same as that of A, and whose product is defined by z @ y := $ ( ~ y  + yz). 
We remark that both the bounded degree and the power-associativity pass 
from A to A". 

114 
Lemma 2.1. Let A be a normed algebra over K satisfging llx211 = llx112 for 
every x E A, and such that A" is power-associative and of bounded degree. 
Then A has a norm-one unit. 
Proof. Since A" is a commutative power-associative algebra of bounded 
degree, and has no nonzero element x such that x2 = 0, it follows from 
Proposition 2 of 21 that A" has a unit element (say 1). Moreover, since 
11111 = 111211 = 111112, we have 11111 = 1. Then, since A is a normed algebra, 
both L1 and R1 lie in the closed unit ball of the normed algebra C(A) of 
all continuous linear operators on A. Since i(L1 + R1) = IA (the identity 
operator on A), and IA is an extreme point of the closed unit ball of C(A) 
(by Proposition 1.6.6 of 93), it follows that L1 = R1 = IA, i.e., 1 is a unit 
element for A. 
0 
Now we can prove the main result in this subsection. It is due to El- 
Mallah and Micali 45, and reads as follows. 
Theorem 2.4. R, C, W, and 0 are the unique absolute-valued power- 
associative real algebras. 
Proof. Let A be an absolute-valued power-associative real algebra. By 
Proposition 1.3, A is of bounded degree. Then, by Lemma 2.1, A has a 
unit. Finally, by the noncommutative Urbanik-Wright theorem, A is equal 
to either R, C, 
W, 
or 0. 
0 
The original proof of El-Mallah and Micali differs not too much of the 
above one. Of course, they did not know Lemma 2.1, which has been proved 
here by the first time. Thus, in the El-Mallah-Micali proof, Lemma 2.1 
was replaced with a simpler purely algebraic result (see Lemma 1.1 of 45). 
Anyway, both Lemma 1.1 of 45 and Proposition 2 of l7 (which has been 
one of the tools in the proof of Lemma 2.1, and is also of a purely algebraic 
nature) have a common root, namely the proof of Lemma 5.3 of 94. Before 
the appearance of the Urbanik-Wright paper, Wright knew that R, C, W, 
and 0 are the unique unital absolute-valued power-associative real algebras 
(see the introduction of log). This (today doubly unsubstantial) result 
was rediscovered by L. Ingelstam 54 (four years after the appearance of 
the Urbanik-Wright paper!) with a proof essentially identical to the one 
suggested by Wright in log. Anyway, the Wright-Ingelstam argument has 
some methodological interest. Indeed, it shows that, in an autonomous 

115 
proof of Theorem 2.4, the noncommutative Urbanik-Wright theorem can 
be replaced with Albert’s forerunner given by Proposition 1.6. 
As we commented in Subsection 2.2, smooth normed algebras are pre- 
Hilbert spaces. A converse to this fact is proved in Proposition 2.1 immedi- 
ately below. The key tools are Lemma 2.1 and the result of B. Zalar 
(see 
also Theorem 3 of ‘12) that IR and C are the unique pre-Hilbert associative 
commutative real algebras A satisfying llz211 = )1z112 for every z E A. 
Proposition 2.1. Let A be a normed real algebra. 
conditions are equivalent: 
Then the following 
(1) A is a smooth-normed algebra. 
(2) A is power-associative, the norm of A derives from an inner prod- 
(5’) A” is power-associative, the norm of A derives from an inner prod- 
uct, and the equality 1)z211 = )1z112 holds for every z E A. 
uct, and the equality llz211 = ))z)12 
holds for every z E A. 
Proof. The implication (1) + (2) is a consequence of Theorem 27 of 82, 
whereas the one (2) + (3) is clear. Assume that Condition (3) is fulfilled. 
Then, by Zalar’s result quoted above, the algebra As is of bounded degree. 
Therefore, by Lemma 2.1, A has a norm-one unit. Since pre-Hilbert spaces 
are smooth at all their norm-one elements, it follows that A is a smooth- 
normed algebra. 
0 
The following result of Zalar ‘11 follows straightforwardly from Propo- 
sition 2.1 above and Hurwitz’s theorem (see Subsection 2.2). 
Theorem 2.5. Let A be an absolute-valued real algebra whose norm springs 
from an inner product, and such that AS is power associative. Then A is 
equal to either W, C, W, 
or 0. 
In relation to Proposition 2.1, it is worth mentioning that smooth 
normed algebras are precisely those unital normed algebras A satisfying 
111 - z211 = 111 + zlllll - zll for every z E A, as well as those unital 
normed algebras A satisfying IIVz(y)II = 1 1 ~ ) ) ~ ) ) y J I  
for all z,y E A, where 
U%(y) := z(yz) + (yz)z - yz2 (see Corollary 29 of ”). Another characteri- 
zation of smooth normed algebras is given in the next proposition. 
Proposition 2.2. Let A be a normed real algebra. 
conditions are equivalent: 
Then the following 
(1) A is a smooth-normed algebra. 

116 
(2) A is power-associative, and the equality IIUz(y)II = llx11211~ll holds 
for all x, y E A. 
Proof. In view of Proposition 2.1 and the comments immediately above, 
it is enough to show that (2) implies that A has a unit. Assume that (2) is 
fulfilled. Then for x, y in any single-generated subalgebra of A, we have 
Therefore, all single-generated subalgebras of A are absolute-valued alge- 
bras. By Proposition 1.3, A is of bounded degree. Finally, by Lemma 2.1, 
A has a unit.

Proposition 2.2 was first proved by M. Benslimane and N. Merrachi lo 
with slightly different techniques. More information about smooth normed 
algebras can be found in Subsection 3.5. 
To conclude the present subsection, let us comment that Theorem 2.4 is 
“almost” contained in the early paper of Urbanik lo2. Indeed, it could have 
been very easy for him to establish such a theorem by selecting, among 
the many auxiliary results in that paper, the appropriate ones for the goal. 
However, Urbanik does not do this, since he completely devotes his paper 
lo2 to characterize R, @, IHI, and 0 in terms conceptually far from the 
power-associativity. An element x of an algebra A is said to be reversible 
if there exists y E A satisfying x + y - xy = x + y - yx = 0. The algebra A is 
said to fulfill the reversibility condition if all its elements, except those 
in some countable set, are reversible. Now the main result in lo2 reads as 
follows. 
Theorem 2.6. R, @, W, 
and 0 are the unique absolute-valued real algebras 
satisfying the reversibility condition. 
Note that for A equal to either R, @, IHI, or 0, 
all elements of A, except 
the unit of A, are reversible. 
2.5. Flexibility 
An algebra is said to be flexible whenever it satisfies the identity 
( 2 1 2 2 ) q  = x1(z2q). Since single-generated subalgebras of flexible al- 
gebras are commutative, the commutative Urbanik-Wright theorem applies 
successfully to single-generated subalgebras of absolute-valued flexible al- 
gebras. After a lot of work, involving the information obtained from the 
procedure just pointed out, El-Mallah and MiCali 46 prove the following. 

117 
Lemma 2.2. Absolute-valued flexible algebras are finite-dimensional. 
Later, El-Mallah, in a series of papers (see 36, 37, 38, 39, and 40), refines 
deeply the result just reviewed, by considering absolute-valued algebras sat- 
isfying the identity xx2 = x2x (which is of course implied by the flexibility), 
and proving the following. 
Theorem 2.7. For an absolute-valued real algebra A, the following asser- 
tions are equivalent: 
(1) A is flexible. 
(2) A is a pre-Hilbert space and satisfies the identity x2x = xx2. 
(3) A is finite-dimensional and satisfies the identity x2x = xx2. 
(4) A is equal to either R, C, C, Ell, H, 0, 0, or the algebra P of 
* 
* 
* 
pseudo-octonions. 
According to Theorem 2.7 just formulated, the algebra P of pseudo- 
octonions is the unique absolute-valued flexible real algebra which has 
been not still introduced in our development. Such an algebra was discov- 
ered by S. Okubo 72 (see also pages 65-71 of 70). The vector space of P is 
the eight-dimensional real subspace of M3 (C) consisting of those trace-zero 
elements which remain fixed after taking conjugates of their entries and 
passing to the transpose matrix. The product 0 
of P is defined by choosing 
a complex number p satisfying 3p(1 - p )  = 1, and then by putting 
1 
x 0 
y := p ~ y  
+ (1 - / L ) ~ x  
- z T ( x y ) l .  
Here T denotes the trace function on M3(C), 1 stands for the unit of the 
associative algebra I@(@), 
and, for x,  y in P, 
x y  means the product of x and 
y as elements of such an algebra. If for x ,  y E P we define (xly) := i T ( x y ) ,  
then (.I.) becomes an inner product on P whose associated norm is an 
absolute value. 
In relation to Theorem 2.7, it seems to be an open problem (see the 
abstract of 41) if every absolute-valued real algebra satisfying the identity 
x2x = xx2 is finite-dimensional. According to Theorem 2.7 itself, the an- 
swer is affirmative if A is a pre-Hilbert space. The answer is also affirmative 
if A is algebraic 41, but, as we will see in Subsection 2.7, this result is today 
unsubstantial. As a more ambitious problem, we can wonder whether every 
absolute-valued algebra satisfying some identity is finite-dimensional. 
The classification of absolute-valued flexible real algebras contained in 
Theorem 2.7 was tried in 63, with a partial success. Actually, such a clas- 

118 
sification can be derived from Lemma 5.3, Proposition 1.5, and 73. The- 
orem 2.7 has inspired the result in 34 that finite-dimensional composition 
algebras satisfying the identity x2x = xx2 are an fact flexible. 
2.6. H*-theory 
The following theorem has been proved by J. A. Cuenca and the author 26. 
Theorem 2.8. Let A be an absolute-valued algebra over K. Assume that 
there exists a complete inner product (.I.) on A, together with an involutive 
conjugate-linear operator * on A, satisfying (zylz) = (xlzy*) = (y(x*z) for 
all x, y , z  E A. Then we have: 
(1) A is finite-dimensional. 
(2) The Hilbertian norm. x + 
absolute-value of A. 
(3) The operator * is an algebra involution on A. 
(4) The equality x*(zy) = (yx)x* = 
With the terminology of 25, the assumptions on (.I.) 
and * in The- 
orem 2.8 mean that, forgetting the absolute value of A, (A,(.[.),*) 
is a 
semi-H*-algebra over K, The conclusion, that * is in fact an algebra in- 
volution, then reads as that (A, (.I.), *) is an H*-algebra over K. Besides 
a little H*-theory 2 5 ,  the proof of Theorem 2.8 involves some results on 
absolute-valued algebras previously reviewed (as Wright’s Theorem 1.3), 
and others to be reviewed later (as for example Theorem 3.8). Such a 
proof, as well as that of Theorem 2.9 below, also includes some easy facts 
first pointed out in 86. Among these, we emphasize the following one for 
later reference. 
is a positive multiple of the 
holds for all x, y, z E A. 
Lemma 2.3. Let A be an absolute-valued algebra over K. Assume that the 
absolute-value of A comes from an inner product (.I.), and that, for every 
x E A, there exists x* E A satisfying (xylz) = (ylz*z) for all x, y, z E A. 
Then we have x*(xy) = 
for all x, y , z  E A. 
Proof. For x, y E A, we have (zylxy) = Ilxl12(yly). Linearizing in the 
variable y, we obtain that the equality (zzlxy) = IIx112(zly) holds for all 
x,y, 
z E A. Since (xzIxy) = (zlx*(xy)), we deduce (zIz*(zy)) = 11x112(z1y), 
0 
The Cuenca-Rodriguez paper 26 also contains a precise determination 
of the algebras A in Theorem 2.8. Since the case that K = C is unsub- 
which, in view of the arbitrariness of z ,  yields z * ( x y )  = ll~11~y. 

119 
stantial (see Subsection 2.8 later), only the case that R = R merits to be 
considered. Thus, in view of Theorem 2.8, we are dealing in fact with an 
absolute-valued finite-dimensional real algebra A endowed with an algebra 
involution *, and whose norm derives from an inner product (.I.) satisfying 
x*(xy) = (yx)x* and (xylz) = (xlzy*) = (ylx*z) for all z,y,z E A. Since 
* is isometric, we can consider the isotope of A (say B) consisting of 
the normed space of A and the product x @ y := x*y*. Now, we triv- 
ially realize that the absolute-valued real algebra B is flexible and satisfies 
(x 0 
ylz) = (zly 0 
z) for all z, y, z E B. Then, we deduce from El-Mallah’s 
Theorem 2.7 that B is equal to either R, @, W, 0, or P. Moreover, * be- 
comes an algebra involution on B, and the correspondence (A, *) 4 (B, *) 
is categorical and bijective. After the laborious classification of algebra in- 
volutions on @, W, 0, and P made in 26, the determination of the algebras 
in Theorem 2.8 concludes. In this way, three new distinguished examples 
of absolute-valued finite-dimensional real algebras appear. These are the 
natural isotopes of MI, 0, and P (denoted respectively by W, 0, and @ built 
as follows. For every absolute-valued algebra A, and every linear isometry 
$ on A, the $-twist of A is defined as the absolute-valued algebra consist- 
ing of the normed space of A and the product x @ y := $(x)$(y). For A 
equal to either JH[ or 0, 
we define 
as the $-twist of A, where $ stands 
for the essentially unique involutive automorphism of A different from the 
identity operator (see Subsection 1.4). On the other hand, there exists an 
“essentially” unique algebra involution 0 on P, which allows us to define @ 
as the 0-twist of P. Now we have the following. 
Theorem 2.9. Let A be an absolute-valued real algebra fulfilling the re- 
quirements in Theorem 2.8. Then A is equal to either R, 
@, ;, 
JHI, fi, 0, 
6, 
or@.

A slight variant of the proof of Theorem 2.9 sketched above, involving 
Corollary 7 of 74 instead of Theorem 2.7, can be seen in Remark 2.9 of 26. 
2.7. Alge braicit y 
Albert’s Proposition 1.6, although obsolete after the noncommutative 
Urbanik-Wright theorem, has had the merit of encouraging the work on 
the question if every absolute-valued algebraic algebra is finite-dimensional. 
Since for complex algebras such a question has an almost trivial affirmative 
answer (see the concluding paragraph of Subsection 2.8 below), the interest 
centers in the case of real algebras. Some partial affirmative answers have 

120 
been provided by El-Mallah. Thus, an absolute-valued algebraic real alge- 
bra is finite-dimensional whenever there exists a nonzero idempotent in A 
commuting with every element of A 36, or there exists a continuous algebra 
involution * on A satisfying xx* = x*x for every x E A 39J or A satisfies 
the identity xx2 = x2x 41. We note that the result in 36 would become later 
a consequence of the one in 39 (see El-Mallah's Theorem 3.2), and that the 
result in 41 was already commented at the conclusion of Subsection 2.5. 
To specify that an algebra A is of bounded degree, let us say that A 
is of degree n E N if n is the minimum natural number such that all 
single-generated subalgebras of A have dimension 5 n. It follows from 
Proposition 1.4, that absolute-valued algebraic real algebras are of bounded 
degree, and, more precisely, of degree 1,2,4, or 8. Then, since IR is the 
unique absolute-valued algebraic algebra of degree 1 (see again the conclud- 
ing paragraph of Subsection 2.8), the strategy of studying separately the 
cases of degree 2,4, and 8 could seem tempting in order to answer affir- 
matively the question we are considering. Unfortunately, such an strategy 
has turned out to be unsuccessful for the moment, unless for the case of 
degree 2, for which we have the following result of the author 89. 
Theorem 2.10. The absolute-valued real algebras of degree two are @, @, 
*@, @*, W, h, *HIJ MI*, 0, 6, 
*0, O*, and IF'. 
* 
Via the commutative Urbanik-Wright theorem, Theorem 2.10 above 
contains both Theorem 2.4 and the classification of absolute-valued flexible 
real algebras included in Theorem 2.7. However, this is quite deceptive 
because, in fact, the proof of Theorem 2.10 involves Theorem 2.4 and the 
whole Theorem 2.7. In any case, by keeping in mind again the commutative 
Urbanik-Wright theorem, Theorem 2.10 shows by the first time that, for 
absolute-valued algebras, power-commutativity and flexibility are equivalent 
notions. We recall that an algebra is said to be power-commutative if all 
its single-generated subalgebras are commutative, and that flexible algebras 
are power-commutative 7 6 .  Theorem 2.10 has inspired the classification of 
composition algebras of degree two, done in 34. 
Returning to the general problem if absolute-valued algebraic algebras 
are finite-dimensional, we must say that, six years ago, A. Kaidi, M. I. 
Ramirez, and the author 57 succeeded in solving it. Thus we have the 
following. 
Theorem 2.11. A n  absolute-valued real algebra is finite-dimensional if 
(and only i f )  it is algebraic. 

121 
We know no proofs of Theorem 2.11 above others than the original one 
in 57, and the slight variant of it given in 58. We do not enter here the details 
of such proofs, nor even give a sketch of them. Referring the reader to 58 for 
such a sketch, we limit ourselves here to say that both arguments are long 
and complicated, and involve in an essential way the techniques of normed 
ultraproducts 52. Thus, by the first time in the theory of absolute-valued 
algebras, the following folklore result shows useful. 
Lemma 2.4. The normed ultraproduct of every ultrafiltered family of 
absolute-valued algebras over R becomes naturally an absolute-valued al- 
gebra over R. 
Concerning the proof of Theorem 2.11, let us also revisit a minor aux- 
iliary result (namely, Lemma 4.2 of 57). Such a result can be refined as 
follows. 
Lemma 2.5. Let X be a normed space over R, let F : X -+ X be a linear 
contraction, and let M be a finite-dimensional subspace of X .  Assume that 
F is the identity on M ,  and that X is smooth at every norm-one element 
of M .  Then there exists a continuous linear projection IT from X onto M 
such that ker(7r) is invariant under F .  
Proof. Let M* denote the dual space of M .  By a theorem of Auerbach 
(see also Lemmas 7.1.6 and 7.1.7 of 92), there are bases {ml, ..., m k }  and 
(91, ..., gk} of M and M*, respectively, consisting of norm-one elements and 
satisfying gi (mj) = Sij . Extending each gi to a norm-one linear functional 
& on X (via the Hahn-Banach theorem), and considering the mapping 
2 + ~~=,q5i(z)mi 
from X to M ,  it is easily seen that such a mapping 
satisfies the properties asserted for 7r in the statement of the lemma (see 
0 
the proof of Lemma 4.2 of 57 for details). 
Lemma 2.5 above was proved in 57 under the additional assumption 
that the restriction to M of the norm of X springs from an inner product. 
The refinement we have just made does not matter there because, when 
the lemma applies, X is an absolute-valued algebra, and M is a subspace 
of a finite-dimensional subalgebra of X ,  so that the superfluous require- 
ment in the original formulation of the lemma is automatically fulfilled (by 
Proposition 1.5). 

122 
2.8. A remark on complex algebras 
All conditions we have considered above, leading absolute-valued real al- 
gebras to the finite-dimension, in the case of absolute-valued complex al- 
gebras yield that the algebra is C. Indeed, if an absolute-valued complex 
algebra fulfills some of those conditions, then, by restriction of scalars, we 
obtain an absolute-valued real algebra satisfying the same condition, and 
hence the corresponding result applies. But we know that absolute-valued 
finite-dimensional algebras are division algebras, and that C is the unique 
finite-dimensional division complex algebra. 
In some cases, the result obtained in this way can be refined still more. 
For example, the complex version of Theorem 2.2 is that, if A is an absolute- 
valued complex algebra, and if there exists a E A such that aA is dense in 
A, then A = C (see Lemma 1.1 of 26).  On the other hand, the joint complex 
version of Theorems 2.8 and 2.9 is that, if A is an absolute-valued complex 
algebra, and if there exists a complete inner product (.I.) on A making 
the product continuous, and an involutive conjugate-linear operator * on A 
satisfying (zylz) = (zlzy*) for all x,y,z E A, then A = C (see Theorem 
1.2 of ")). None of the two results just quoted remains true (with the 
finite-dimensionality of A instead of A = C in the conclusion) whenever 
real algebras replace complex ones. Concerning the second result, in the 
real case nor even can be expected the Hilbertian norm z + 
to 
be equivalent to the absolute value of A (see Example 1.7 of 26). These 
pathologies give rise to an interesting development of the theory of absolute- 
valued algebras, which will be reviewed in Subsection 3.5. 
As a consequence of Theorem 2.11 and the comments at the beginning of 
the present subsection, C is the unique absolute-valued algebraic complex 
algebra. However, this can be proved elementarily. Indeed, notice that, 
by the same comments, absolute-valued algebraic complex algebras are of 
degree one, and that, if F is a field containing more than two elements, if 
A is an algebra over F of degree one, and if there is no nonzero element 
x E A with x2 = 0, then A = F (see for example page 297 of 57). 
3. Infinite-dimensional absolute-valued algebras 
3.1. The basic examples 
The first example of an absolute-valued infinite-dimensional algebra ap- 
pears in the celebrated paper of Urbanik and Wright lo6. Indeed, they 
show that the classical real Hilbert space l 2  becomes an absolute-valued 
algebra under a suitable product. Looking at their argument, many other 

123 
similar examples can be built. To get them, let us start by fixing an arbi- 
trary nonempty set U ,  and a mapping 6 : U x U --f X ,  where X = X(U,K) 
stands for the free vector space over K on U. We denote by A = A(U, 6, K) 
the algebra over K whose vector space is X ,  and whose product is defined as 
the unique bilinear mapping from X x X to X which extends 6. From now 
on, we assume that U is infinite, and, accordingly to such an assumption, 
we choose 6 among the injective mappings from U x U to U or, more gen- 
erally, of the form f g ,  where g : U x U ---t U is injective and f : U x U + K 
satisfies If(u,v)l = 1 for every (u,v) E U x U. With these restrictions 
in mind, we are going to realize that there are “many” absolute values on 
A. To this end, let us involve a new ingredient, namely an extended real 
number p with 1 5 p 5 00. Then, for x in A, we can think about the family 
{x,},~u of coordinates of x relative to U, 
and define 
llzllp := (CuEu 
Iz,IP)t if p < 00 and IIxllm := max{1z,I : u E U}. 
Invoking the properties of 6, we straightforwardly verify that )I . 11, 
is an 
absolute value on A. We denote by dp = dp(U, 19, K) the absolute-valued 
algebra over K obtained by endowing A with the norm 11. 11,. 
By considering 
the completion of A,, we obtain a complete absolutevalued algebra over R, 
denoted by C, = C,(U, 6, K), whose Banach space is nothing other than the 
familiar space l,(U, K) if p # 00, or Q(U, K) otherwise. Now, the Urbanik- 
Wright example is just the algebra Cz(N, 6, R), with 6 : N x N --f N equal 
to any bijection. 
Returning to our general setting, let us remark that, since C, is a Hilbert 
space if and only if p = 2, it follows from the above construction that com- 
position algebras need not be finite-dimensional, and that, contrarily to 
what is conjectured in 40, absolute-values need not come from inner prod- 
ucts. Another consequence of our construction is that there exist complete 
absolute-valued algebras without uniqueness of the (noncomplete) absolute 
value. Indeed, for 1 5 p < q 5 00, the complete absolute-valued algebra 
C, can be algebraically regarded as a subalgebra of C,, but the topology of 
the restriction of the absolute value of C, to C, does not coincide with the 
natural one of C,. 
The straightforward fact, that 11 - 11, 
2 11 . 11, 
on C,, is 
not anecdotic. Indeed, as a consequence of Theorem 3.8 below, every com- 
plete algebra norm on an absolute-valued algebra is greater than the absolute 
value. In particular, two complete absolute values on the same algebra must 
coincide. 
The refinement of the Urbanik-Wright example, done above, is implic- 
itly known in some works on Banach spaces (see for instance the proof of 

124 
Theorem 3.a.10 of 6 5 ) .  The interest of such a refinement in the theory of 
absolute-valued algebras seems to have been first pointed out in 85. 
A real algebra A is said to be ordered if it is provided with a subset 
A+ of positive elements, which is closed with respect to multiplication by 
positive real numbers and with respect to addition and multiplication in A, 
and satisfies A+ n (-A+) = 0 and A+ U ( -Af) = A \ (0). In lo4, Urbanik 
shows that IR is the unique absolute-valued finite-dimensional ordered real 
algebra. Nevertheless, he also proves the following. 
Theorem 3.1. There exists a com.plete absolute-valued infinite-dimen- 
sional ordered real algebra. 
A simplification of Urbanik’s argument is the following. 
Proof. Let 6 : N x N + N be defined by 6(n,m) := 2n3m, and let us fix 
1 5 p 5 00. Since 6 is injective, we can consider the complete absolute- 
valued infinite-dimensional real algebra C, = C,(N, 6, R). The natural in- 
clusion N -+ 
C, converts N into a Schauder basis of C,. 
For z E C,, let 
{ z n } , E ~  stand for the family of coordinates of z relative to such a basis, 
and, when z # 0, define n(x) := min{n E N : IC, # 0). Finally, put 
C t  := {x E C, \ (0) : zrn(%) 
> 0). Keeping in mind that 19 is increasing 
in each one of its variables, it is easily seen that C$ fulfils the properties 
required above for the sets of positive elements of ordered real algebras. 0 
3.2. h
e
 normed nonassociative algebras 
Let us fix a nonempty set V .  Nonassociative words with characters in 
V are defined inductively (according to their “degree”) as follows. The 
nonassociative words of degree 1 are just the elements of V .  If n 2 2, and 
if we know all nonassociative words of degree < n, then the nonassociative 
words of degree n are defined as those of the form ( W I ) ( W ~ ) ,  
where w1 and 
w2 are nonassociative words with deg(wl)+deg(w2) = n. Although the use 
of brackets is essential in the above definition, some natural simplifications 
in the writing are usually accepted. For example, brackets covering a word 
of degree 1 are omitted, and words of the form (w)(w), for some other 
word w, 
are written as ( w ) ~ .  
Two nonassociative words are taken to be 
equal only if they have exactly the same writing. Thus for example, for 
v E V ,  the nonassociative words vv2 and v2v are different. Now, denoting 
by U the set of all nonassociative words with characters in V ,  and by 6 the 
mapping (~1,202) 
-+ (w1)(w2) from U x U to U ,  we can think about the 

125 
algebra A( U, 6, K) constructed in the preceding subsection. Since such an 
algebra depends only on V and K, 
we denote it by F(V,K). The algebra 
.F(YiK)] called the free nonassociative algebra on V over K, 
contains 
V in a natural manner, and is characterized up to algebra isomorphisms 
by the following “universal property”: If A is any algebra over K, 
and 
if cp : V + A is any mapping, then ‘p extends uniquely to an algebra 
homomorphism from F(V,K) to A (see Theorem 1.1.1 of ‘13). Now, since 
the mapping 29 above is injective (by Proposition 1.1.2 of ‘13), we invoke 
again the preceding subsection to realize that there are “many” absolute- 
values on F(V, IK). In the original proof Io4 of Theorem 3.1, Urbanik already 
knows that, when V reduces to a singleton, F(V, R) becomes an absolute- 
valued algebra under the norm 1). 112. The general case of such an observation 
is due to M. Cabrera and the author (who announced it in 16), and appears 
formulated with the appropriate precisions first in 85. For 1 5 p 5 co, 
we denote by Fp(V,IK) the absolute-valued algebra over IK obtained by 
endowing F(V, 
K) (= d(U, 
6, K) for U and 29 as above) with the absolute 
value 11 . I l p  . As we are seeing in the proof of Proposition 3.1 immediately 
below, the absolute-valued algebra F1 (V, K) has a special relevance in the 
general theory of normed algebras. 
Proposition 3.1. Let V be a nonempty set. Then, up to isometric algebra 
isomorphisms, there exists a unique normed algebra N = N(V, K) over K 
satisfying the following properties: 
(1) V is a subset of the closed unit ball of N. 
(2) If A is any normed algebra over IK, and if cp is any mapping from 
V into the closed unit ball of A, then cp extends uniquely to a con- 
tractive algebra homomorphism from N to A. 
Moreover, we have: 
(3) The normed algebra N is in fact an absolute-valued algebra. 
(4) The set V consists only of norm-one elements of N .  
Proof. Take N = Fl(V,K). Clearly N satisfies Properties (I), (3), and 
(4) in the statement. Let A be a normed algebra over IK, and let cp be a 
mapping from V into the closed unit ball of A. Since, forgetting the norm, 
N is nothing other than F(V, IK), the universal property of this last algebra 
provided us with a unique algebra homomorphism 11, : 31 (V, K) 
--f A which 
extends cp. Let x be in N. We have x = CwEU 
xww, where U denotes the 
set of all nonassociative words with characters in V ,  and { I C , } , ~ ~  stands 

126 
for the family of coordinates of x relative to U. Therefore 
(Starting from the fact that $(V) is contained in the closed unit ball of 
A, the inequality ll$(w)II 5 1 just applied is proved by induction on the 
degree of w.) Now that we know that N also satisfies Property (2), let us 
conclude the proof by showing that Af is the “unique” normed algebra over 
K satisfying (1) and (2). Let N’ 
be a normed algebra over K satisfying 
(1) and (2) with N’ 
instead of N , Then we are provided with contractive 
algebra homomorphisms 4 : N -+ N’ 
and 4’ : N’ 
+ N fixing the elements 
of V .  Therefore $04 and 40# are contractive algebra endomorphisms of N 
and N ‘, respectively, extending the corresponding inclusions V 4 N and 
V -+ N I. By the uniqueness of such extensions, we must have 4’ 0 4 = IN 
and c$ o 4’ = I,v I .  It follows that @ is an isometric algebra isomorphism 
from N onto N’ 
respecting the corresponding inclusions of V in each of 
the algebras. 
0 
Now, if A is a normed algebra over K, if V denotes the closed unit ball of 
A, and if CP : N(V, K) -+ A is the unique contractive algebra homomorphism 
which is the identity on V, then we easily realize that the induced algebra 
homomorphism N(V, K)/ ker(@) -+ A is a surjective isometry. Therefore, 
we have the following. 
Corollary 3.1. Every normed algebra over K is isometrically algebra- 
isomorphic to a quotient of an absolute-valued algebra over K. 
The absolute-valued algebra N(V, K) in Proposition 3.1 has its own 
right to be called the free normed nonassociative algebra on the set 
V over K. The variant of Proposition 3.1, with Lccomplete normed” instead 
of “normed” everywhere, is also true, giving rise to the free complete 
normed nonassociative algebra on the set V over K. This algebra is 
implicitly involved in the proof of the following result. 
Corollary 3.2. Every complete normed algebra over K is isometrically 
algebra-isomorphic to a quotient of a complete absolute-valued algebra 
over K. 
Proof. Let A be a complete normed algebra over K. Choose any subset 
V of A whose closed absolutely convex hull is the closed unit ball of A. 
By Proposition 3.1, N(V,K) is an absolute-valued algebra over K whose 

127 
closed unit ball contains V ,  and there exists a contractive algebra homo- 
morphism from N(V,IK) to A fixing the elements of V .  By passing to the 
completion of N(V, IK), and invoking the completeness of A, we are in fact 
provided with a complete absolute-valued algebra B over IK whose closed 
unit ball contains V ,  and a contractive algebra homomorphism @ : B -+ A 
fixing the elements of V .  Let A1 and B1 denote the closed unit balls of A 
and B, respectively. Since a(&) is an absolutely convex subset of A con- 
taining V, and A1 is the closed absolutely convex hull of V, the closure of 
@(B1) in A contains Al. Now, from the main tool in the proof of Banach’s 
open mapping theorem (see for example Lemma 48.3 of 11) we deduce that 
@(B1) contains the open unit ball of A. Since 
: B -+ A is a contractive 
algebra homomorphism, it follows from the above that the induced algebra 
0 
homomorphism B/ ker(@) 4 A is a surjective isometry. 
Of course, the most confortable choice of V in the above proof is the 
one V = A1 . However, finer selections of V allow us to realize that the 
absolute-valued algebra B can be chosen with the same density character 
as that of A. We recall that the density character of a topological space 
E is the smallest cardinal among those of dense subsets of E. 
Gelfand-Naimark algebras are defined as those complete normed 
complex algebras A endowed with a conjugate-linear algebra involution * 
satisfying 11x*x11 = 1 1 ~ 1 1 ~  
for every x E A. Their name is due to the cel- 
ebrated Gelfand-Naimark theorem 30 that there are no Gelfand-Naimark 
associative algebras others than the closed *-invariant subalgebras of the 
Banach algebra C ( H )  of all continuous linear operators on some complex 
Hilbert space H ,  when this last algebra is endowed with the involution * de- 
termined by (x(q)I<) = (qlx*(<)) for every x E C ( H )  and all q,< E H .  The 
nonassociative Gelfand-Naimark theorem 
asserts that unital Gelfand- 
Naimark algebras are alternative. Moreover, every alternative Gelfand- 
Naimark algebra can be seen as a closed *-invariant subalgebra of a unital 
Gelfand-Naimark algebra, and the study of alternative Gelfand-Naimark 
algebras can be reasonably reduced to that of associative ones and to that 
of the complexification of 0 
with suitable norm and involution. For these 
and other interesting results in the theory of Gelfand-Naimark alternative 
algebras the reader is referred to 56 and references therein. Now, absolute- 
valued algebras provide us with examples of Gelfand-Naimark algebras 
which are not alternative. Indeed, it follows easily from Proposition 3.1 
that, for any nonempty set V ,  the absolute-valued algebra N(V, C) has an 
isometric conjugate-linear algebra involution fixing the elements of V .  By 

128 
passing to the completion, we obtain an absolute-valued Gelfand-Naimark 
algebra which is not alternative (nor even satisfies any identity when V 
is infinite). As pointed out in 87, the same remains true if we start from 
Fp(V,C) (1 5 p I 
m) instead of N(V,C) (= .?’l(V,C)). 
3.3. Center, centroid, and extended centroid 
Let A be an algebra over a field IF. For x, y, z E A, we write [z, y] := xy- yx 
and [x, y, z] := (xy)z-z(yz). The center of A (denoted by Z(A)) is defined 
as the set of those elements x E A such that 
and is indeed an associative and commutative subalgebra of A. The cen- 
troid of A (denoted by r ( A ) )  is defined as the set of those linear operators 
f on A satisfying f(zy) = f(z)y = xf(y) for all x,y E A, and becomes 
naturally an associative algebra over IF with a unit. Under the quite weak 
assumption that there is no nonzero element x E A with XA = Ax = 0, 
the associative algebra r(A) is also commutative, and, by identifying each 
element z E Z(A) with the operator of left multiplication by z on A, Z(A) 
imbeds naturally into r(A). From now on, assume that A is prime (i.e., 
PQ # 0 whenever P and Q are nonzero (two-sided) ideals of A). Then 
r ( A )  becomes an integral domain, and hence it can be enlarged to its field 
of fractions. However, such an enlargement does not provide any additional 
information on the structure of A. By the contrary, a larger field exten- 
sion of r(A), called the extended centroid of A and denoted by C(A), 
has turned out to be very useful to determine the behaviour of A 47. The 
elements of C(A) are those linear mappings f : Pf --f A, where Pf is some 
nonzero ideal of A, satisfying f(xp) = xf(p) and f ( p z )  = f(p)x for every 
(z, p )  E A x Pf. Two elements f, g E C(A) are considered to be “equal” if 
they coincide on Pj n Pg. Summing and composing elements of C(A) as is 
usually done for partially defined operators, such sum and composition are 
compatible with the notion of “equality” settled above, and convert C(A) 
into a field extension of IF. Moreover, r ( A )  imbeds naturally into C(A). 
Now, if A is an absolute-valued real algebra, then, by Theorem 2.1, we 
have Z ( A )  = 0 unless A is equal to either R, C, IHI, or 0. 
As a conse- 
quence, Z(A) = 0 for every absolute-valued complex algebra A different 
from C. Noticing that every absolute-valued algebra A is a prime algebra, 
the determination of r(A) follows from the inclusion r ( A )  C C(A), and 
Proposition 3.2 immediately below. 

129 
Proposition 3.2. Let A be an absolute-valued algebra over R. 
C(A) = @ if K = C, and C(A) is equal to either R or C if K = R. 
Then 
Proof. In view of Lemma 1.1, it is enough to show that C(A) can be 
endowed with an absolute value. To this end, we claim that, if f, g are in 
C(A), if f is “equal” to g, and if p and q are norm-one elements of Pf and 
P,, respectively, then 11 f (p)” = 11g(q)11. Indeed, p q  lies in Pf n P,, so we 
have f ( p ) q  = f (P4) = d p q )  = pg(q), and hence 
Ilf(P)ll = Ilf(P)nll = Ilpg(q)ll = 119(q)11~ 
as desired. Now f 4 llf(p)II, with f and p as above, becomes a (well- 
defined) real valued mapping on C(A), and it is easily seen that such a 
0 
mapping is an absolute value. 
Proposition 3.2 above can be derived either from Theorem 3 and Remark 
2 of l6 (by keeping in mind Lemma 2.4), or straightforwardly from Corollary 
1 of ”. The autonomous proof given here is taken from 86. 
As a consequence of Proposition 3.2, if A is an absolute-valued alge- 
bra over K, 
then r ( A )  = C if K = @, and r ( A )  is equal to either R or 
C if K = R. Let A be an absolute-valued real algebra. We can have 
either C(A) = r ( A )  = R (as happens in the case A = R,W, or O), 
C(A) = r(A) = @. (which happens if and only if A is the absolute-valued 
real algebra underlying a complex one), or C(A) = C and r ( A )  = R. To 
exemplify the last possibility, note that it is easily deduced from Propo- 
sition 3.1 the existence of a complete absolute-valued complex algebra B, 
together with a continuous nonzero algebra homomorphism 4 from B to C. 
Taking v E B with 4(v) = 1, and putting A := Rv @ ker(4), A becomes 
a closed real subalgebra of B (and hence, a complete absolute-valued real 
algebra) such that C(A) = C and r ( A )  = R. Although Proposition 3.1 was 
not explicitly known in 86, the example just reviewed appears there with 
an argument essentially equal to that we have given here. 
3.4. Algebras with involution 
The following result is due to Urbanik lol. 
Proposition 3.3. Let A be an absolute-valued real algebra endowed with 
an isometric algebra involution * which is different from the identity oper- 
ator and satisfies xx* = x*x for every x E A. Then self-adjoint elements 
commute with skew elements, and there exists an idempotent e E A such 

130 
that the equality x*x = 11x112e holds for every x E A. As a Consequence, the 
absolute value of A comes from an inner product. 
Looking at B. Gleichgewicht’s paper 49, we discovered that the first as- 
sertion in the conclusion of Proposition 3.3 is nothing other than a joint 
reformulation of Lemmas 1, 2, and 3 of lol. Keeping in mind such a refor- 
mulation, the consequence that A is a pre-Hilbert space, proved in Lemma 
4 of loll seems to us obvious. 
Seventeen years after the appearance of Urbanik’s paper loll El- 
Mallah 39 shows that, if A is an absolute-valued real algebra fulfilling the 
requirements in Proposition 3.3, then the comrnutant of e in A (say B )  is 
in fact a self-adjoint subalgebra of A, and we have B = Re @ A,, where A, 
stands for the space of all skew elements of A. Shorty later, he proves the 
remarkable converse which follows. 
Theorem 3.2. 40 Let A be an absolute-valued real algebra containing a 
nonzero idempotent e which commutes with all elements of A. Then the 
absolute-value of A derives from an inner product (.I.). 
Moreover, the iso- 
metric mapping x 4 x* := 2(xJe)e - x becomes an algebra involution on A 
satisfying x*x = xx* for every x E A .  
The conclusion in Theorem 3.2, that A is a pre-Hilbert space, remains 
true if the requirement of the existence of a nonzero idempotent which 
commutes with all elements of A is relaxed to that of the existence of a 
nonzero element a which commutes with all elements of A and satisfies 
a(aa2) = (a2)2 (see 42), El-Mallah’s paper 39, already quoted, contains 
results non previously reviewed, some of which merits a methodological 
comment. For instance, the proof of Theorem 5.6 of 39 (asserting that an 
absolute-valued algebra A is finite-dimensional whenever so is the subspace 
of A spanned by squares and there exists a E A \ (0) satisfying a x  = xu for 
every x E A )  can be concluded after its two first lines. Indeed, we have the 
following. 
Lemma 3.1. Let A be an absolute-valued algebra over K such that there 
exists a E A \ (0) satisfying a x  = x u  for every x E A. Then A imbeds 
linearly and isometrically into the subspace S(A) of A spanned by squares. 
Proof. We may assume llull = 1. Since for x E A we have ( a  + x ) ~  
= 
a2 + 2ax + x2, we deduce La(A) C_ S(A). But La is a linear isometry. 

131 
Now, let us return to Urbanik's paper lo' to review its main results. 
These are a construction method producing in abundance absolute-valued 
real algebras A fulfilling the requirements of Proposition 3.3, and a theorem 
characterizing the algebras obtained from such a construction. The ingre- 
dients of the construction are an infinite set U ,  a nonempty subset T of U 
such that #(U \ 5") = #U (where # means cardinal number), an element 
uo E T ,  an injective function 4 from the family of all binary subsets of U 
to U whose range does not intersect T ,  and a function $ : U x U + (1, -1) 
satisfying+(u,w)+$(v,u) = Owhenever (u,v) E (TxT)U((U\T)x(U\T)), 
and $(u, 
u)  = 1 otherwise. Now, putting ~ ( u )  
:= f l  depending on whether 
or not u belongs to T ,  and defining 19 : U x U -+ X(U, R) by 
8(u, 
w) := $(u, w)$({u, v}) if u # Y and 6(u, 
u) := E(U)UO, 
we consider the associated real algebra A = A(U,d,R) in the meaning 
of Subsection 3.1. After a careful calculation, we realize that A becomes 
an absolute-valued algebra under the norm llxJJ := (xuEU 
1x,)2)i, where 
{ x , } , ~ ~  
is the family of coordinates of z relative to U .  Moreover, the 
unique linear operator * on A which extends the mapping u 4 E(U)U from 
U to A becomes an isometric algebra involution satisfying x*x = xx* for 
every x E A. If in addition we put ((sly)) := $(xy* + yx*), then we 
have ((xylzt)) = ((xz*Iy*t)) for all z,y,z,t E A. Passing to the comple- 
tion of A, we obtain a complete absolute-valued real algebra, denoted by 
R = R(U, 
T, U O ,  4, +), which is endowed with an isometric algebra involu- 
tion * satisfying x*x = xz* and ((xylzt)) = ((xy*lz*t)) for all x,y,z,t E R, 
where ((xly)) := :(xy* + yz*). Following lol, we codify the information 
on R just collected by saying that R is a regular absolute-valued *- 
algebra. 
To classify regular absolute-valued *-algebras, Urbanik introduces a par- 
ticular appropriate type of isotopy, called similarity. If A is a regular 
absolute-valued *-algebra, and if F : A 4 A is a surjective linear isom- 
etry commuting with *, then the Banach space of A with the same invo- 
lution becomes a new regular absolute-valued *-algebra under the prod- 
uct z @ y := F(xy). Algebras obtained from A by the above procedure 
are called similar to A. By the way, two algebras R(U,T,UO,C$,+) 
and 
R(U', 
TI, ub, 4', $ I )  are similar if and only if #U = #U', #T = #TI, and 
#S = #S', where S stands for the set of those elements of U which are 
neither in T nor in the range of 4. Thus, each similarity class of the al- 
gebras in Urbanik's construction depends only on three cardinal numbers 
W I , W ~ , W ~  
with a 1  infinite, a 3  5 wl, and 0 # w2 I wl. Denoting by 

1 32 
~ ( w l ,  
w2, w3) such a similarity class, Urbanik’s structure theorem for reg- 
ular absolute-valued *-algebras reads as follows. 
Theorem 3.3. Every regular absolute-valued *-algebra is similar to either 
R, @ (with * equal to either the identity or the standard involution), or 
one in the class X(w1, w2, w3) for suitable cardinal numbers wl, w2, w3 as 
above. 
Let A be an absolute-valued real algebra endowed with an isometric 
algebra involution * which is different from the identity operator and sat- 
isfies xx* = x*x for every x E A. By replacing the product of A with the 
one x 
y := x*y, and applying Proposition 3.3, we are provided with an 
absolute-valued real algebra B satisfying x 0 x = llx112e for every x E B 
and some fixed idempotent e E B. This implies 112 @ x + y @ yyII 2 lly112 for 
all x ,  y E B. Since, in view of Urbanik’s construction, the algebra A (and 
hence B )  can be chosen infinite-dimensional, we arrive in Gleichgewicht’s 
counterexample 49 to Urbanik’s problem lo3 if every absolute-valued real 
algebra A containing a nonzero idempotent and satisfying 11x2 +y211 2 lly112 
for all x, y E A is isomorphic to R. Finite-dimensional counterexamples are 
*@, *H, and *O. The converse of Gieichgewicht’s construction is also true. 
Indeed, as proved by Urbanik Io4, if B is an absolute-valued real algebra 
such that the linear hull of squares is one-dimensional, then there exists an 
absolute-valued real algebra A, with an isometric algebra involution * satis- 
fying xx* = x*x for every x E A, such that B consists of the normed space 
of A and the product x @ y  := x*y. Gleichgewicht’s absolute-valued infinite- 
dimensional algebras were rediscovered by Ingelstam in a more direct way 
(see Proposition 4.4 of 54). 
:= ( ~ ( ” 1 ) ~  
((x,n) E A x N), and let us say that A is semi-algebraic if for every 
x E A there exists n E N such that the subalgebra of A generated by x ( ~ )  
is finite-dimensional. Clearly, the infinite-dimensional absolute-valued real 
algebra B in Gleichgewicht’s counterexample is semi-algebraic. This gives 
some interest to El-Mallah result 44 that If A is an absolute-valued serni- 
algebraic real algebra fu2filling the requirements in Proposition 3.3, then A 
is finite-dimensional. 
Given an algebra A, let us define inductively x(l) := x ,  
We conclude this subsection with another result of El-Mallah. 
Theorem 3.4. 43 Let A be an absolute-valued real algebra endowed with 
an isometric algebra involution * such that the equality xx* = x*x holds 
for every x E A. If A satisfies the identity x(xx2) = ( x ~ ) ~ ,  
then A is 

133 
isomorphic to either R, C., H, 
or 0. 
Proof. If * is different from the identity operator, then the original proof 
in 43 works without problems. Otherwise, A is commutative, and hence 
equal to either R, C, or @. (by the commutative Urbanik-Wright theorem). 
0 
But 6 
does not satisfy the identity z(zz2) = (z2)>". 
3.5. One-sided division algebras 
An algebra A is said to be a left- (respectively, right-) division algebra 
if, for every nonzero element z E A, the operator L, (respectively, R,) 
is bijective. Since absolute-valued one-sided division complex algebras are 
equal to C (see Subsection 2.8), our interest centers in the real case. Then, 
refining an argument of Wright log, we can prove the following. 
Lemma 3.2. Let A be an absolute-valued left-division real algebra. Then 
A is a pre-Hilbert space. 
Proof. First assume that A has a left unit e. Then, since Le = IA (the 
identity operator on A), for every norm-one element z E A, we have 
Now remove the assumption that A has a left unit, and note that, for each 
norm-one element e E A, the normed space of A becomes an absolute- 
valued algebra with left unit e under the product z @ y := L;'(zy). 
It 
follows 4 5 llz + ell2 + 11% - ell2 for all norm-one elements e, z E A. Finally, 
apply Schoenberg's theorem. 
0 
Now we can prove one of the main results in this subsection. 
Theorem 3.5. Let A be an absolute-valued real algebra with a left unit e. 
Then the absolute-value of A derives from an inner product (.I.), 
and, 
putting x* := 2(zle)e - z, we have (zylz) = (ylz*z) and z*(zy) = JI~11~y 
for all x, y, z E A. 
Proof. We may assume that A is complete. Then an argument, involving 
connectedness and elementary Operator Theory, shows that A is a left 

1 34 
division algebra (see Lemma 2.2 of 59). By Lemma 3.2, the norm of A 
comes from an inner product (.I.). 
For y,u in A with (elu) = 0, we have 
(1 + l142)11Y112 = Ile + ~11211Y112 = Il(e + U)YIl2 
= IIY + UY1I2 = (1 + 1 1 ~ 1 1 2 ) 1 1 ~ 1 1 2  + 2(UYlY) 7 
and hence (uyly) = 0. 
By linearizing in the variable y, we deduce 
(uy/Iz) = -(yluz) for all u , y , z  E A with (el.) 
= 0, or, equivalently, 
0 
(zylz) = (ylz*z) for all z, y, z E A. Finally, apply Lemma 2.3. 
The following corollary follows straightforwardly from Theorem 3.5 
above, Lemma 2.3 just applied, and the fact that every absolute-valued 
left-division algebra is isotopic to an absolute-valued algebra with a left 
unit (see the proof of Lemma 3.2). 
Corollary 3.3. A n  absolute-valued algebra is a left-division algebra if and 
only if it is isotopic to an absolute-valued algebra A whose norm derives 
from an inner product (.I.) such that, for each x E A, there exists x* E A 
satisfying (xylz) = (ylz*z) for all y, z E A. 
Theorem 3.5 and Corollary 3.3 were first proved by the author (see 85 
and 8 6 ,  respectively). The proof of Theorem 3.5 in 85 is different from 
that we have given here, and can seem more involved, since Theorem 3.5 
is derived there from a more general principle (namely, Theorem 1 of 85). 
Really, if we take from the proof of Theorem 1 of 85 the minimum necessary 
to get Theorem 3.5, then most complications disappear. From Theorem 3.5 
we derive that absolute-valued real algebras with a left unit are left-division 
algebras. More generally, we have the following. 
Corollary 3.4. A n  absolute-valued real algebra A is a left-division algebra 
if (and only if) there exists e E A such that e A  = A. 
We do not know if Corollary 3.4 remains true when the requirement 
e A  = A is replaced with the one that e A  is dense in A. 
In view of Lemma 3.2, absolute-valued left-division real algebras are 
composition algebras. In 61, Kaplansky proved that composition division 
algebras are finite-dimensional, and commented on his attempts to show 
that the same is true when “division” is relaxed to “left-division”. We are 
going to realize that such attempts could not be successful, by constructing 
absolute-valued infinite-dimensional left-division real algebras. To this end, 
is it convenient to reformulate Theorem 3.5 in a more sophisticated way. 

135 
We recall the facts, already commented in Subsection 2.2, that smooth- 
normed real algebras are pre-Hilbert spaces, and that their algebraic struc- 
ture is well-understood. Some precisions, taken from 82, are needed here. 
For instance, if A is a smooth-normed real algebra, then the mapping 
x .--) x* := 2(x(1)1 - x becomes an algebra involution on A, which is 
uniquely determined by the fact that, for every x E A, both x + x* and x*x 
lie in R1. Here 1 denotes the unit of A, and (.I.) 
stands for the inner prod- 
uct from which the norm of A derives. If the smooth-normed real algebra 
A is commutative, then actually the unit and the inner product determine 
the algebra product by means of the equality 
XY = (4l)Y + (YI1)X - (XlY)l. 
(1) 
Now note that, conversely, every nonzero real pre-Hilbert space H becomes 
a smooth-normed commutative real algebra by choosing any norm-one ele- 
ment 1 E H and then by defining the product according to the equality (1). 
Note also that the choice of the norm-one element 1 above is structurally 
irrelevant because pre-Hilbert spaces are transitive normed spaces. It fol- 
lows that smooth-normed commutative real algebras and nonzero real pre- 
Hilbert spaces are in a bijective categorical correspondence. Now, Let A be 
a smooth-normed commutative real algebra, and let H be a nonzero real 
pre-Hilbert space. By a unital *-representation of A on H we mean any 
linear mapping 4 : A .+ L(H) satisfying 4(1) = I H ,  +(x2) = (4(x))’, 
and 
(+(x)(r])[[) 
= (r]Iq5(x*)(<)) for every x E A and all r], < E H. The first asser- 
tion in Theorem 3.6 immediately below is easily verified (see t~~ for details), 
whereas the second one is the desired reformulation of Theorem 3.5. 
Theorem 3.6. If A is a smooth-normed commutative real algebra, and if 
is a unital *-representation of A on its own pre-Hilbert space, then the 
normed space of A with the new product 0 defined by x 0 
y := 4(x)(y) 
becomes an absolute-valued real algebra with a left unit. Moreover, there 
are no absolute-valued real algebras with a left unit others than those given 
by the above construction. 
One of the main results in the mathematical modelling of Quantum 
Mechanics is the possibility of representing the so-called “Canonical Anti- 
commutation Relations” by means of bounded linear operators on complex 
Hilbert spaces 14. Applying such a result, it is proved in 85 that every com- 
plete smooth-normed infinite-dimensional commutative real algebra has a 
unital *-representation on its own Hilbert space. Therefore we have the 
following. 

136 
Theorem 3.7. Every infinite-dimensional real Hilbert space becomes an 
absolute-valued algebra with a left unit, under a suitable product. 
In the case that the infinite-dimensional real Hilbert space is separable, 
Theorem 3.7 was proved simultaneously and independently by Cuenca 23. 
Cuenca’s proof isof course easier than the one in 85 for the general case. 
The key idea in 23 consists of a “doubling process” which, after an induction 
argument, assures that, for every n E N, 
the smooth normed commutative 
real algebra A, of dimension n has a unital *-representation 4, on the real 
pre-Hilbert space H, of dimension 2”-l. Moreover, regarding 
A1 C_ A2 C ... C A, E ... and H1 C Hz 
... & H, & ... 
in a convenient way, we have +,+l(z)(q) = +,(z)(q) whenever n, z, 
and 
q are in W, A,, and H,, respectively. Then A := U n E ~ A n  
is a smooth 
normed commutative real algebra having a unital *-representation on the 
real pre-Hilbert space H := U n E ~ H n .  Since H can be identified with the 
pre-Hilbert space of A, the separable version of Theorem 3.7 follows from 
the first assertion in Theorem 3.6 by passing to completion. 
The proof of Theorem 3.7 given in 85 shows in addition that the prod- 
uct, converting the arbitrary infinite-dimensional real Hilbert space into an 
absolute-valued algebra with a left unit, can be chosen in such a way that 
the corresponding algebra has no nonzero proper closed left ideals. 
Recently] Elduque and Perez 33 have proved that every infinite- 
dimensional real vector space can be endowed with a pre-Hilbertian norm 
and a product which convert it into an absolute-valued algebra with a left 
unit. Since, in the construction of 33, the pre-Hilbertian norm and the 
product can be chosen in such a way that an arbitrarily prefixed algebraic 
basis becomes ortonormal, it follows that Theorem 3.7 can be derived from 
the Elduque-PBrez result by an easy argument of completion. 
Very recently] relevant progresses about the representations of the 
Canonical Anticommutation Relations on separable real Hilbert spaces have 
been done in the paper of E. Galina, A. Kaplan, and L. Saal 50. As pointed 
out by these authors, their results give rise to a classification, up to an iso- 
topy, of all separable complete absolute-valued left-division real algebras. 
Now that the existence of absolute-valued infinite-dimensional left- 
division real algebras is not in doubt, Propositions 3.4 and 3.5, and Corol- 
lary 3.5 below have their own interest. 
Proposition 3.4. Let A be an absolute-valued real algebra with a left unit. 
Then the following assertions are equivalent: 

137 
(1) For all x, y E A, there exists z E A such that L, o L, = L, o L, 
(2) The dimension of A is equal to either 1, 2, or 4. 
Proof. Keeping in mind that R, C, and W are associative division algebras, 
the implication (2) + (1) is an easy consequence of Proposition 1.8. Let L 
denote the space of all left multiplication operators on A. It follows easily 
from Theorem 3.5 that F2 lies in L whenever F is in L. Therefore both

and 
F o G O  F = 2 F 0  ( F a  G) - F2 O G 
lie in L whenever F,G are in L. Assume that (1) is true. Let z,y be in A 
with x # 0. Then, keeping in mind that the operator L, is bijective (by 
Theorem 3.5), the assumption (1) reads as L, o L, o L i l  E L. But, again 
by Theorem 3.5, the norm of A derives from an inner product (.I.) such 
that, denoting by e the left unit of A, and putting z* := 2(zle)e - z, we 
have Lzl = ~\X))-~L,. 
. Thus L, o L, o L,. 
E L. Since L, o L, o L, E L and 
z + x* = 2(xle)e, we deduce (xle)L, o L, E L or, equivalently, L, 0 L, E L 
whenever (xle) # 0. Since the set {t E A : (tle) # 0 )  is dense in A, and 
the mapping t -+ Lt from A to the normed algebra C(A) (of all continuous 
linear operators on A) is a linear isometry, we obtain L, o L, E L without 
any restriction. In this way, L becomes a subalgebra of C(A) containing the 
unit of C(A). Since the algebra C(A) is associative, and L is a pre-Hilbert 
space for the operator norm, it follows from Theorem 3.1 of 54 that L is a 
0 
copy of R, @, or W. Therefore A has dimension equal to 1, 2, or 4. 
Proposition 3.5. Let A be an absolute-valued real algebra with a left unit, 
and let 111 . 111 be an algebra norm on A. Then we have 11 . I( I 
(11 . 111. 
Proof. Let e denote the left unit of A, and let 2 be in A. According to 
Theorem 3.5, we have L,.

Now apply Proposition 1.1.

We do not know if Proposition 3.5 remains true whenever the require- 
ment of the existence of a left unit in A is relaxed to the one that A is a 
left-division algebra. In any case, we have the following. 

138 
Corollary 3.5. Let A be a left-division real algebra. Then there exists at 
most one absolute value on A. 
Proof. Let 11 . 11 and 111.111 be absolute values on A. Fix e E A with llell = 1, 
and consider the absolute-valued real algebra B consisting of the vector 
space of A, the norm 11 
1 11, and the product z o y := L;'(zy). Since B 
has a left unit, and lllelll-llll . 111 is an algebra norm on B, Proposition 3.5 
applies giving that )I .I) 5 l)elll-ll]l .)I). Then, keeping in mind that 1 . )I/ is an 
algebra norm on A, and that 11 11 is an absolute value on A, we deduce from 
Proposition 1.1 that 11 
)I 5 1)) . 111. By symmetry, we have also 1)) . 11) 5 1) . 11.0 
Corollary 3.5 above was first proved in 
with crafter techniques. 
3.6. Automatic continuity 
Minor changes to the proof of Corollary 3.5 could allow us to realize that 
if A is an absolute-valued left-division algebra, and if 111 . 111 is a complete 
algebra norm on A, then we have ) I  . 11 5 111 ' 111. However, this fact becomes 
unsubstantial in view of the result which follows. 
Theorem 3.8. Let A be a complete normed algebm over K, let B be an 
absolute-valued algebra over K, 
and let $J ; A + B be an algebra homomor- 
phism. Then 4 is contractive. 
Keeping in mind Proposition 1.1, the actual message of Theorem 3.8 
above is that algebra homomorphisms from complete normed algebras to 
absolute-valued algebras are automatically continuous. We do not enter 
here the original proof of Theorem 3.8 in 85. Limiting ourselves to mention 
its main ingredients (namely, Theorem 2.2 and a little Operator Theory, 
including Lemma 3.1 of 83), we prefer to review here how such a proof 
has inspired further developments of the theory of automatic continuity in 
settings close to that of absolute-valued algebras. To this end, we note that, 
replacing the absolute-valued algebra B with the completion of the range 
of 4, the proof of Theorem 3.8 reduces to the case that B is complete and 
4 has dense range. Thus, for K = @, Theorem 3.8 follows straightforwardly 
from Theorem 3.9 immediately below. 
Theorem 3.9. Algebra homomorphisms from complete normed complex 
algebras to complete normed complex algebras with no nonzero two-sided 
topological divisor of zero are continuous. 

139 
To prove Theorem 3.9, we introduced in 
quasi-division algebras. 
These are defined as those algebras A such that L, or R, is bijective for 
every x E A \ (0). Then we proved that, if A and B are complete normed 
algebras over R, if B is not a quasi-division (respectively, division) algebra, 
and if B has no nonzero two-sided (respectively, one-sided) topological di- 
visors of zero, then dense range algebra homomorphisms from A to B are 
continuous. With the help of 83, this implies that, if A and B are com- 
plete normed algebras over K, 
and if B has no nonzero two-sided topological 
divisors of zero, then surjective algebra homomorphisms from A to B are 
continuous. Now, Theorem 3.9 follows from the results just quoted and 
Proposition 3.6 immediately below. 
Proposition 3.6. 
bra has dimension 5 2. 
Every complete normed quasi-division complex alge- 
For JK = R, 
Theorem 3.8 can be also derived from the results in 
quoted 
above, by applying Wright’s Theorem 1.3 instead of Proposition 3.6. Some 
additional information, related to the discussion of the proof of Theorem 
3.8 just done, is collected in the next remark. 
Remark 3.1. i) In view of Corollary 3.4, absolute-valued quasi-division 
algebras are in fact one-sided division algebras. 
ii) We do not know if Theorem 3.9 remains true when real algebras 
replace complex ones. Even if the range algebra has no nonzero one-sided 
topological divisors of zero, the question remains open. The point is that 
the old problem log, if every complete normed division real algebra is finite- 
dimensional, remains still unsolved. In relation to this problem, let us note 
that, as a consequence of Theorems 3.5 and 3.7, there exist complete normed 
infinite-dimensional real algebras A such that, for every x E A \ {0}, the 
operators L, and R, are surjective (see Proposition 8 of 85 for details). 
iii) The question of the automatic continuity of homomorphisms into 
finite-dimensional algebras has been definitively settled in 17. Indeed, given 
a norrned finite-dimensional algebra B over K, 
all algebra homomorphisms 
from all complete normed algebras over K to B are continuous if and only 
if B has no nonzero element x with x2 = 0. 
From now on, let R be a locally compact Hausdorfl topological space. 
Given a normed algebra A over JK, the space Co(0, A), of all A-valued con- 
tinuous functions on Q which vanish at infinity, becomes a normed algebra 
over JK under the product defined point-wise and the sup norm. If follows 

140 
from Lemma 2.10 of 71 and Theorem 3.8 that, if A is an absolute-valued al- 
gebra over K, then algebra homomorphisms from complete normed algebras 
over R to Co(R,A) are continuous. The paper of M. M. Neumann, M. V. 
Velasco and the author 71, a minor result of which has been just applied, 
contains a deeper variant of the fact reviewed above. By an 3-algebra we 
mean a real or complex algebra endowed with a complete metrizable vector 
space topology making the product continuous. Now we have the following. 
Theorem 3.10. 71 Let F be an 7-algebra over R, let A be an absolute- 
valued algebra over K, and let 4 : F + Co(R,A) be an algebra homo- 
morphism. Assume that R has no isolated points, and that the range of 4 
separates the points of R. Then 4 is continuous. 
Here, that a subset S of Co(R,A) separates the points of R means 
that, whenever w1 and w2 are different points of 0, we can find f E S such 
that f(wl) = 0 and f(w2) # 0. Other results of a flavour similar to that of 
Theorem 3.10 are also proved in 71. For example, if A is an absolute-valued 
algebra over R, if R has no isolated points, and if F is a subalgebra of 
Co(S2, A) which separates the points of R and is endowed with an 7-algebra 
topology, then every derivation of F is continuous. As a consequence, if 
A is a complete absolute-valued algebra over R, and if R has no isolated 
points, then every derivation of Co(R, A) is continuous. We recall that a 
derivation of an algebra A is a linear operator D on A satisfying 
D(ZY) = a Y )  + D b ) Y  
for all IC, y E A. The results in 71 we have reviewed are in fact corol- 
laries to more general facts. In particular, all these results remain true 
when absolute-valued algebras are replaced with normed algebras without 
nonzero left topological divisors of zero. Appropriate variants of such results 
also hold when absolute-valued algebras are replaced with normed algebras 
with a unit. The associative side of 71 has its own interest, and appears as 
Section 5.6 of 64. The announcement of 71 done in lo7 centres more in the 
nonassociative aspects, paying special attention to the applications in the 
theory of absolute-valued algebras. 
In contrast with Theorem 3.8, we do not know if derivations of complete 
absolute-valued algebras are automatically continuous. Anyway, we have 
the following. 
Proposition 3.7. Absolute-valued complex algebras have no nonzero con- 
tinuous derivations. 

141 
Proof. Let A be an absolute-valued complex algebra (which can be as- 
sumed complete), and let D be a continuous derivation of A. Then, for 
every complex number A, exp(AD) is an algebra automorphism of A, and 
hence we have 11 exp(AD)II = 1 (by Proposition 1.1). Now apply Liouville’s 
theorem to deduce D = 0. 
0 
Proposition 3.7 does not remain true when real algebras replace com- 
plex ones. Indeed, W and 0 
have nonzero derivations in abundance. With 
the language of “numerical ranges” 12, the general version of Proposition 
3.7 is that continuous derivations of an absolute-waled algebra over K have 
numerical ranges equal to zero. Proposition 3.7 then follows since, by 
the Bohnenblust-Karlin theorem, continuous linear operators on a complex 
normed space must be zero provided their numerical ranges are zero. 
4. Some deviations of the theory 
4.1. Nearly absolute-valued algebras 
For every normed algebra A over K, 
let us define p(A) as the largest non- 
negative real number p satisfying pllz\IIIylI 5 llzyll for all z,y E A. Those 
normed algebras A such that p(A) > 0 are called nearly absolute-valued 
algebras. Let A be a normed finite-dimensional algebra over K. Then, by 
the compactness of spheres, A is nearly absolute-valued if (and only if) it 
is a division algebra. Moreover, if this is the case, then A is isomorphic to 
C when K = C, and the dimension of A is equal to 1,2,4, or 8 when K = R 
(by Theorem 1.2). On the other hand, by Hopf’s theorem (see page 235 
of 31) , nearly absolute-valued finite-dimensional commutative real algebras 
have dimension 5 2. We note that, since every finite-dimensional alge- 
bra over K can be endowed with an algebra norm, nearly absolute-valued 
finite-dimensional real algebras and finite-dimensional division real algebras 
essentially coincide. 
By Theorem 1.1, every nearly absolute-valued alternative real algebra 
is isomorphic to either R, @, W, or 0, 
so that no much more can be 
said about such an algebra. The consequence that nearly absolute-valued 
alternative algebras are algebra-isomorphic to absolute-valued algebras is 
no longer true if alternativeness is removed (even for finite-dimensional 
normed algebras A wit p(A) near one). For instance, for 0 < E < 4, 
consider the normed real algebra A consisting of the normed space of W 
and the product IC 0 
y := (1 - E)ZY + E ~ Z .  Then we have p(A) 2 1 - 2 ~ ,  
but A cannot be algebra-isomorphic to an absolute-valued algebra. Indeed, 

142 
A is not associative and has a unit, whereas every absolute-valued four- 
dimensional real algebra with a unit is isomorphic to W (by Theorem 2.1). 
The above example shows in addition how a theory of nearly absolute- 
valued algebras parallel to that of absolute-valued algebras cannot be ex- 
pected. Another notice in the same line is that, in contrast with Theo- 
rem 2.3, there exist nearly absolute-valued infinite-dimensional commuta- 
tive algebras over K. Indeed, as proved in Example 1.1 of 59, for every 
infinite set U and every injective mapping 6 : U x U + U, 
the complete 
normed real algebra A obtained by replacing the product of &(U, 6, K) (see 
Subsection 3.1) with x 0 
y := ;(xy + y z )  satisfies p(A) 2 2-a. 
Despite the above limitations, in the paper of Kaidi, Ramirez, and the 
author 59 just quoted we wondered whether there could be a theory of 
nearly absolute-valued algebras “nearly” parallel to that of absolute-valued 
algebras. More precisely, we raised the following. 
Question 4.1. Let P be anyone of the purely algebraic properties leading 
absolute-valued real algebras to the finite dimension. Is there a universal 
constant 0 5 Kp < 1 such that every normed real algebra A satisfying P 
and p(A) > K p  is finite-dimensional? 
We were able to answer Question 4.1 for the most relevant choices of 
Property P. Thus we have the following. 
Theorem 4.1. 59 Question 4.1 has an afirmative answer whenever Prop- 
erty P is equal to the existence of a unit, the commutativity, or the al- 
gebraicity. Moreover, for such choices of P, the universal constant K p  
can be (uniquely) chosen in such a way that there exists a normed infinite- 
dimensional real algebra satisfying P and p(A) = Kp. 
Now, fundamental Theorems 2.1, 2.3, and 2.11 are “nearly” true when 
nearly absolute-valued algebras replace absolute-valued algebras. As a con- 
sequence, a normed power-commutative real algebra A is finite-dimensional 
whenever p(A) is near one. Many other results of the same flavour can 
be obtained (see for example the variants of Theorems 2.2, 2.8, and 3.8 
proved in Corollaries 3.2 and 3.4, and Theorem 3.3 of 59, respectively). We 
already know that Kp 2 2-i when P means commutativity. When P 
means algebraicity or existence of a unit, we do not know whether or not 
the equality Kp = 0 holds. In any case, Nearly absolute-valued complex 
algebras are isomorphic to C whenever they have a left unit or are algebraic 
(see Remark 2.8 of 59 and our Subsection 2.8, respectively). If they are 
commutative, then a result similar to the one given by Theorem 4.1 (with 

143 
P equal to the commutativity) holds. 
A normed space X is said to be uniformly non-square if there exists 
0 < u < 1 such that the inequality min{l)z + y J J ,  
J]z - yII} < 20 holds 
for all x,y in the closed unit ball of X .  We note that pre-Hilbert spaces 
are uniformly non-square, and that the completion of every uniformly non- 
square normed space is a superreflexive Banach space (see Theorem VII.4.4 
of 27). We also remark that neither absolute-valued algebras nor nearly 
absolute-valued finite-dimensional algebras with a unit need be uniformly 
non-square (by our Subsection 3.1 and Example 2.1 of 59, respectively). 
These facts give its own interest to the following variant of Theorem 3.5. 
Theorem 4.2. 59 Let A be a normed real algebra with p(A) > 2-a. If there 
exists a E A such that a A  is dense in A, then A is uniformly non-square. 
4.2. Other deviations 
By a trigonometric algebra we mean a pre-Hilbert real algebra A sat- 
where Q is the angle between z and y )  for all z, y E A \ (0). By cleverly ap- 
plying Hurwiz’s theorem (see Subsection 2.2), P. A. Terekhin loo shows that 
the dimensions of finite-dimensional trigonometric algebras are precisely 1, 
2, 3, 4, 7, and 8. The existence of complete trigonometric algebras of arbi- 
trary infinite Hilbertian dimension is implicitly known in 59. Indeed, if U is 
an infinite set, and if 6 is an injective mapping from U x U to U ,  then the 
real Hilbert algebra obtained from the absolute-valued algebra C2(U, 6, IR) 
(see Subsection 3.1) by replacing its product with the one x @ y := Iy--y2 
becomes a trigonometric algebra (see Remark 1.6 of 59 for details). Actu- 
ally, all infinite-dimensional -trigonometric algebras can be constructed in 
a transparent way from the absolute-valued real algebras with involution 
considered in Subsection 3.4 (see 9). 
By a triple system over a field IF we mean a nonzero vector space 
T over IF endowed with a trilinear mapping (. . .) : T x T x T 4 T. 
Absolute-valued triple systems over K are defined as those triple sys- 
tems T over K endowed with a norm )I . 11 satisfying [I(zyz)ll = llzllIlyllllzll 
for all z, y ,  z E T. Each absolute-valued triple system gives rise to “many” 
absolute-valued algebras. Indeed, if T is an absolute-valued triple system, 
and if u is a norm-one element in T, then the normed space of T becomes 
an absolute-valued algebra under the product x 0 
y := ( m y ) .  As pointed 
out in 18, this implies (by Proposition 1.5) that the norm of every absolute- 
valued finite-dimensional real triple system springs from an inner product. 
isfying llzy1I2 + (4Y)2 = 11~11211Y112 (or, equivalently, IlzYIl = ll~llllYll sin%

144 
It follows that, if T is an absolute-valued finite-dimensional real triple sys- 
tem, then the mapping q : x --f ))x))2 
is a quadratic form on T satisfying 
q((xyz)) = q(x)q(y)q(z) for all x, y , z  E T. Now we can mimic Albert’s 
definition of isotopy (see Subsection 1.3), and apply the main result in 
K. McCrimmon’s paper 67, to get that, up to an isotopy, the absolute- 
valued finite-dimensional real triple systems are R, C (with ( x y z )  = x y z  in 
both cases), W (with (xcyz) equal to either xyz, x z y ,  or yxz), and 0 
(with 
( x y z )  equal to either (xy)z, ( x z ) y ,  ( y x ) z ,  ~ ( g z ) ,  
~ ( z y ) ,  
or y(xz)). This 
result is a sample of how the study of absolute-valued triple systems can 
be promising (see l8 and ‘O). 
An algebra A is said to be two-graded if it can be written as 
A = A0 @ All where A0 and A1 are nonzero subspaces of A satisfying 
AiAj 
Ai+j for all i , j  E Zz. Two-graded absolute-valued algebras 
are defined as those normed two-graded algebras A = A0 @ A1 over K sat- 
isfying IlxixjII = Ilxillllxjll for all i , j  E Zz and every (xi,xj) E Ai x Aj. 
The work of A. J. Calder6n and C. Martin l9 deals with these objects, and 
starts with the observation that, if A is a two-graded absolute-valued alge- 
bra, then, in a natural way, A0 is an absolute-valued algebra, and A1 is an 
absolute-valued triple system. As a consequence, two-graded absolute-valued 
finite-dimensional real algebras have dimension 2, 4, 8, or 16. 
5. Absolute-valuable Banach spaces 
In this concluding section we are going to deal with those Banach spaces 
which underlie complete absolute-valued algebras. Such Banach spaces will 
be called absolute-valuable. The finite-dimensional side of this topic 
is definitively solved by Albert’s Proposition 1.5. Indeed, the absolute- 
valuable finite-dimensional real Banach spaces are precisely the real Hilbert 
spaces of dimension 1, 2, 4, and 8. On the other hand, it is clear that 
C is the unique absolute-valuable finite-dimensional complex Banach space. 
Therefore, the interest of absolute-valuable Banach spaces centers into the 
infinite-dimensional case. 
5.1. The isometric point of view 
We already know that, for every infinite set U ,  the classical Banach spaces 
lp(U, K) (1 5 p < co) and Q(V, JK) are absolute-valuable (see Subsec- 
tion 3.1). In fact, the rol played there by JK can be also played by any 
absolute-valued algebra, and hence we have that, given an infinite set U 
and a Banach space X ,  the Banach spaces lp(U,X) (1 5 p < m) and 

145 
co(U, X )  are absolute-valuable whenever so is X .  Even, the value p = 00 is 
allowed above (by Proposition 5.2 below). Other stability properties of the 
class of absolute-valuable Banach spaces can be also derived from previously 
reviewed results. For example, it follows from Lemma 2.4 that the normed 
ultraproduct of every ultrafiltered family of absolute-valuable Banach spaces 
is an absolute-valuable Banach space. More examples of absolute-valuable 
Banach spaces are given in Proposition 5.1 immediately below. As usual, 
given Banach spaces X and Y over K, 
we denote by C ( X ,  Y )  the Banach 
space over R of all bounded linear operators from X to Y, and by K ( X ,  Y) 
the closed subspace of C ( X l  Y) consisting of all compact operators from 
X to Y. Moreover, we write X * ,  L ( X ) ,  and K ( X )  instead of L ( X , R ) ,  
C ( X ,  X ) ,  and K ( X ,  X ) ,  respectively. 
Proposition 5.1. Let 1 5 p 5 m, let U1 be an infinite set, and let X 1  
stand for lP(U~,IK). 
Then X,* is absolute-valuable. Moreover, if U2 is 
another infinite set, and if X2 stands for eP(U2,R), then C ( X l , X , )  and 
K ( X 1 ,  X2) are absolute-valuable. 
As a consequence, infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces over R are 
absolute-valuable, and moreover, if H1 and H2 are infinite-dimensional 
Hilbert spaces over IK, then C(H1, Hz) and K(H1, H2) are absolute-valuable. 
The paper of J. Becerra, A. Moreno, and the author 7 ,  from which we 
have taken Proposition 5.1, also contains Theorem 5.1 immediately below. 
Given a topological space El we denote by dens(E) the density character 
of E (see Subsection 3.2). 
Theorem 5.1. Every Banach space X over R is linearly isometric to a 
subspace of a Banach space Y over R with dens(Y) = dens(X) and such 
that Y, Y*, C(Y), and K(Y) are absolute-valuable. 
The ideas in the proof of Theorem 5.1 are not far from those in Propo- 
sition 5.2 immediately below. I n  what follows, R will denote a compact 
Hausdorff topological space. 
Proposition 5.2. Assume that there exists a continuous surjection from 
R to R x R, and let X be an absolute-valuable Banach space. Then C(R, X )  
is absolute-valuable. 
Proof. Let us choose a product (x, 
y) 4 zy on X converting X into an 
absolute-valued algebra, let q5 : R + R x R stand for the continuous sur- 
jection whose existence is assumed, and, for i = 1,2, let 7ri : R x R 4 R 

146 
denote the i-th coordinate projection. Then the product o on C(R,X) 
defined by (f o g ) ( w )  := f(7rI(q5(w)))g(7rz($(w))) (for every w E R and all 
f, g E C(R, X ) )  converts C(R, X) 
into an absolute-valued algebra. 
We note that the choice R = [0,1] is allowed in Proposition 5.2 (see 
and references therein). According to that proposition, the existence of a 
continuous surjection from R to R x R is a suficient condition for C(R, K) 
to be absolute-valuable. In 69, a partial converse is shown. Indeed, we have 
the following 
Theorem 5.2. If C(fl,K) is absolute-valuable, then there exists a closed 
subset F of R, and a continuous surjection from F to R x 52. 
As a consequence, C(R,K) is not absolute-valuable whenever R is the 
one-point compactification of a discrete infinite space (a fact first proved 
in 7). In particular, the classical space c of all real or complex convergent 
sequences is not absolute-valuable. Theorem 5.2 is also applied in 69 to 
prove that, in the case that R is metrizable, C(R,K) is absolute-valuable if 
and only if R is uncountable. The arguments for Theorem 5.2 mimic those 
in the proof of a theorem of W. Holsztynski on nonsurjective isometries 
between C(R)-spaces (see Section 22 of 96). 
Given a Banach space X ,  we denote by Q the group of all surjective 
linear isometries on X .  We recall that a Banach space X is said to be tran- 
sitive (respectively, almost transitive) if, for every (equivalently, some) 
norm-one element u in X ,  B(u) is equal to (respectively, dense in) the unit 
sphere of X .  The reader is referred to the book of S. Rolewicz 92 and the 
survey papers of F. Cabello l5 and Becerra-Rodriguez * for a comprehensive 
view of known results and fundamental questions in relation to the notions 
just introduced. Hilbert spaces become the natural motivating examples of 
transitive Banach spaces, but there are also examples of non-Hilbert almost 
transitive separable Banach spaces, as well as of non-Hilbert transitive non- 
separable Banach spaces. However, the Banach-Mazur rotation problem, 
if every transitive separable Banach space is a Hilbert space, remains un- 
solved to date. Since almost transitive finite-dimensional Banach spaces 
are indeed Hilbert spaces, the rotation problem is actually interesting only 
in the infinite-dimensional setting. Then, since infinite-dimensional Hilbert 
spaces are absolute-valuable, we feel authorized to raise the following strong 
form of the Banach-Mazur rotation problem. 
Problem 5.1. Let X be an absolute-valuable transitive separable Banach 
space. Is X a Hilbert space? 

147 
We hope Problem 5.1 to have an affirmative answer in the next future. 
In the meantime, we must limit ourselves to review the following. 
Proposition 5.3. 
There exists a non-Hilbert absolute-valuable almost 
transitive separable Banach space X such that C(X, Y) and K(X, 
Y) are 
absolute-valuable for every absolute-valuable Banach space Y .  
Actually, the space X in Proposition 5.3 can be taken equal to 
L1([0,1])). Proposition 5.3 implies (applying Lemma 2.4 among other tools) 
that there exists a non-Hilbert absolute-valuable transitive non-separable 
Banach space. One of the tools in the proof of Proposition 5.3 is the fol- 
lowing. 
Lemma 5.1. 
Let X and Y be Banach spaces over K. Assume that the 
complete projective tensor product XGTX is linearly isometric to a quo- 
tient of X, and that Y is absolute-valuable. Then C(X, Y) and F(X, 
Y) 
are absolute-valuable. Here 3(X, Y) stands for the space of all finite-rank 
operators from X to Y. 
We conclude the present subsection by applying Lemma 5.1 to prove 
the following 
Theorem 5.3. Every Banach space X over JK is linearly isometric to 
a quotient of an absolute-valuable Banach space Y over JK satisfying 
dens(Y) = dens(X), and such that L(Y,Z), and Ic(Y,Z) are absolute- 
valuable for every absolute-valuable Banach space Z over K. 
Proof, Let U be a set whose cardinal number equals dens(X), and let Y 
stand for the absolute-valuable Banach space ll(U, K). Clearly, we have 
dens(Y) = dens(X). On the other hand, it is well-known that X is linearly 
isometric to a quotient of Y. (In fact, noticing that X becomes a complete 
normed algebra under the zero product, we had to show a little more when 
we proved Corollary 3.2.) Finally, noticing that 
YG,,Y = lI(U,JK)&ll(U,JK) = ll(U x U,K) = l,(U,K) = Y 
(see Ex 3.27 of ") and that Y* has the approximation property (see 5.2 
of 28, the proof is concluded by applying Lemma 5.1 (see 5.3 of 28).

5.2. The isomorphic point of view 
Most isomorphic properties on Banach spaces considered in the literature 
are inherited by quotients and/or subspaces. Therefore, by Theorem 5.1 

148 
and Corollary 5.3, none of such properties can be implied by the abso- 
lute valuableness. Now, recall that a Banach space X is called weakly 
countably determined if there exists a countable collection {Kn}nE~ 
of 
w*-compact subsets of X** in such a way that, for every x in X and every 
u in X** \ X, there exists no such that x E K,, and u @ Kn0. If X is 
either reflexive, separable, or of the form c o ( r )  for any set r, then X is 
weakly countably determined. In fact, the class of weakly countably deter- 
mined Banach spaces is hereditary, and contains the non hereditary class 
of weakly compactly generated Banach spaces (see Example VI.2.2 of 29 for 
details). Among the results proved in 
concerning the isomorphic aspects 
of absolute-valuable Banach spaces, the main one is the following. 
Theorem 5.4. Every weakly countably determined real Banach space, dif- 
ferent from R, is isomorphic to a real Banach space X such that both X 
and X* are not absolute-valuable. 
We do not know if the requirement of countable determination can be 
removed in Theorem 5.4. 
A Banach space X is said to be hereditarily indecomposable if, for 
every closed subspace Y of X, the unique complemented subspaces of Y 
are the finite-dimensional ones and the closed finite-codimensional ones. 
According to the paper of W. T. Gowers and B. Maurey 51, the existence 
of infinite-dimensional hereditarily indecomposable separable reflexive Ba- 
nach spaces over K as not in doubt. On the other hand, we have proved in 
that infinite-dimensional hereditarily indecomposable Banach spaces over R 
fail to be absolute-valuable. Thus, since the hereditary indecomposability is 
preserved under isomorphisms, we are provided with an infinite-dimensional 
Banach space over R which is not isomorphic to any absolute-valuable Ba- 
nach space. In other words, the property of absolute valuableness is not 
isomorphically innocuous. In the case K = C, more can be said. Indeed, 
we have the following. 
Proposition 5.4. Let X be an infinite-dimensional hereditarily indecom- 
posable complex Banach space. 
Then X cannot underlie any complete 
normed algebra without nonzero two-sided topological divisors of zero. 
Proof. By Corollary 19 of 51, X is not isomorphic to any of its proper 
subspaces. Assume that, for some product, X is a complete normed algebra 
without nonzero two-sided topological divisors of zero. Then, for every 
x E X \ {0}, L, or R, is an isomorphism onto its range, and hence it is 

149 
bijective. Now, X is a quasi-division algebra, and hence finite-dimensional 
(by Proposition 3.6). 
Let us say that a Banach space X over K satisfies the Shelah-Steprans 
property whenever X is not separable and, for every F E L ( X ) ,  there exist 
X = X(F) E IK and S = S ( F )  E L ( X )  such that S has separable range and 
the equality F = S + Xlx holds. In our present discussion, Banach spaces 
enjoying the Shelah-Steprans property play a rol similar to that of infinite- 
dimensional hereditarily indecomposable Banach spaces. Indeed, reflex- 
ive Banach spaces satisfying the Shelah-Steprans property do exist (see 97 
and lo8), the Shelah-Steprans property is preserved under isomorphisms, 
and Banach spaces over W fulfilling the Shelah-Stepmns property fail to be 
absolute-valuable '. By the way, the proof of the result of 
just reviewed 
can be slightly refined to get the following. 
Proposition 5.5. Let X be a Banach space over K satisfying the Shelah- 
Steprans property. Then X cannot underlie any complete normed algebra 
without nonzero two-sided topological divisors of zero. 
Proof. First, we note that, for F in L ( X ) ,  the couple (X(F),S(F)) 
given 
by the Shelah-Steprans property is uniquely determined, and that the map- 
pings X : F -+ X(F) and S : F -+ 
S (F) from L ( X )  to W and L(X), respec- 
tively, are linear. Now, since X is not separable, and ker(X) consists of those 
elements of L ( X )  which have separable range, we have X(F) # 0 whenever 
the operator F on X is an isomorphism onto its range. Assume that, for 
some product, X is a complete normed algebra without nonzero two-sided 
topological divisors of zero. Then, since L, or R, is an isomorphism onto 
its range whenever 5 is in X \ {0}, it follows that the linear mapping 
x -+ (X(L,),X(R,)) from X to K2 is injective. Therefore X is finite- 
dimensional, a contradiction.

Concerning the topic of the present section, let us say that the study of 
absolute-valuable Banach spaces is just started, so that there are more prob- 
lems than results on the field. Since we have mainly emphasized the results, 
let us conclude the paper with one of the problems non previously collected. 
Let us say that a Banach space is nearly absolute-valuable if it under- 
lies some complete nearly absolute-valued algebra (see Subsection 4.1). It 
is easy to see that the near absolute valuableness is preserved under iso- 
morphisms. Consequently, isomorphic copies of absolute-valuable Banach 
spaces are nearly absolute-valuable. However, we do not know whether 

150 
or not every nearly absolute-valuable Banach space is isomorphic to an 
absolute-valuable Banach space.
