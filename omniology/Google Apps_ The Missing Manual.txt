Overview
Among its many amazing applications, Google now has web-based alternatives to many of the applications in
Microsoft Office. This comprehensive and easy-to-follow new book enables you to explore Google's new office
applications in detail. Once you do, you'll be in good company -- more than 100,000 small businesses and some
corporations are already looking to take advantage of these free Google offerings. Google Apps: The Missing
Manual teaches you how to use three relatively new applications from Google: "Docs and Spreadsheets", which
provide many of the same core tools that you find in Word and Excel; and Google Calendar and Gmail, the
applications that offer an alternative to Outlook. This book demonstrates how these applications together can
ease your ability to collaborate with others, and allow you access to your documents, mail and appointments
from any computer at any location. Of course, as remarkable as these applications are, Google's office suite is
definitely a work-in-progress. Navigating what you can and can't do and -- more importantly -- understanding
how to do it isn't always easy. And good luck finding enough help online. Google Apps: The Missing Manual is
the one book you need to get the most out of this increasingly useful part of the Google empire. This book:
Explains how to create, save and share each of Google's web-based office applications
Offers separate sections for Docs and Spreadsheets, Google Calendar, and Gmail
Demonstrates how to use these applications in conjunction with one another
Gives you crystal-clear and jargon-free explanations that will satisfy users of all technical levels
Many of you already use Gmail, but do you know its full potential? Do you know how you can increase its power
by using Gmail with Doc and Spreadsheets and Google Calendar? You'll find out with Google Apps: The Missing
Manual. You'll also come to understand why large corporations such as General Electric and Proctor & Gamble
are taking a long, hard look at these applications.

Introduction
You've probably used Google to search the Web—who hasn't? Google is so ubiquitous that it's even become a
verb (you can look it up in Webster's), as in, "I googled the girlfriend I dumped in high school; now she's CEO of
SuperMegaCorp." But Google is way more than a search engine. The full list of services it offers is almost as
mind-boggling as the number of lightning-fast searches it conducts each day. The next time you're on Google's
home page (http://www.google.com), click "more"
"even more" to see the whole smorgasbord: from maps
to a checkout service for online retailers to photo albums and YouTube—and that's just for starters.
The biggest recent news from Google, though, is that it's putting programs online—the kind you used to have to
install on your computer. They include applications for word processing; working with spreadsheets; creating
presentations; reading, writing, and storing your email; and scheduling appointments and meetings. Google's
brought communication, productivity, and collaboration tools right to your Web browser.
Last but certainly not least, the vast majority of Google's programs are free. Yup, you read that right: You can
get word processing, spreadsheets, email, chat, a Web-page builder, and more, and it won't cost you a dime.
Sound interesting? Read on to learn more.
NOTE
In this book, the term app (with a lowercase a), means an individual Google product, like Google
Calendar or Gmail. "App" is an inescapable bit of geek shorthand for "application"—a word that itself is
synonymous with "program."
Google Apps (with a capital A), on the other hand, refers to a bunch of integrated Google products
(including some of the aforementioned apps), all wrapped into a highly customizable package that
Google hopes companies will sign up for as an alternative to Microsoft's Office suite of programs.
Chapters 2–9 cover individual apps, while Chapters 10–13 cover the Google Apps packages for
organizations.
This is just the short version of the individual apps vs. Google Apps conundrum; [click here] tackles this
slightly perplexing naming choice in more detail.
P2.1. Welcome to the World of Web-based Applications
What are Web-based applications? Simply put, they're programs you access over the Internet. You point your
Web browser to the place where the application lives online, and then work with it in the same way you'd work
with a program that lives on your computer.
Google's online offerings mean, for example, that you don't have to install a word processing program on your
computer. Instead, you can fire up your Web browser, point it to http://docs.google.com, sign up for a free
account, and start creating your first document in mere seconds. You don't have to remember to save your
work—Google does that for you automatically—so you can focus on the task at hand. Google stores your files on
its computers (you get lots of free storage space), so your saved documents are safe even if your computer

melts down. And you can work on those documents from pretty much any computer with an Internet
connection: at work, at home, a friend's place, the library, wherever. You can even use Google Docs while
you're offline—when you're flying, for example—so you don't have to be connected to the Internet in order to do
work (Section 2.6 explains how this works.)
P2.1.1. It's Good to Be Web-based
The most obvious advantage of Google's Web-based products and services is that they're free, and who doesn't
like free? But there's a whole bunch of other reasons for using Web-based programs:
Portability. When a program lives on your computer, you can use the program only on that particular
computer. So if you work on your desktop computer in the afternoon and then want to work on your
laptop that evening, you have to remember to transfer the files, or you're out of luck. With Google apps,
you don't install anything on your computer, so you can access your applications—and your data—from
any computer that can connect to the Internet.
Mobility. Web-based applications also work with mobile devices, so you can get to your information from
your Blackberry, iPhone, or any souped-up cellphone. Once you start using Google Docs (Chapters 2–4),
you're free to roam around the planet without fear of being away from your files.
Collaboration. Only you can access a document that lives on your computer's hard drive. If you want to
share it, you have to email it or print it out. When a document lives on the Web, though, you can share it
with lots of people at once. With Google Docs, you can invite coworkers to collaborate on a document with
you, and you can all work on the same document, at the same time (see Section 2.7.3 for more on this
mind-blowing feature). No more emailing spreadsheets around and getting confused about which version
is most current, or waiting for somebody to check a report back into SharePoint so you can have your turn
with it. You're all free to work on the same word processing document, spreadsheet, or presentation
whenever you want.
Integration. Individual Google programs and services can talk to other popular programs. For example,
Google Docs lets you import and export Excel and OpenOffice Calc spreadsheets. And if your company is
thinking of making the switch to Google Apps (see Chapter 10), integration with your existing IT
infrastructure is definitely possible (not a no-brainer, to be sure, but well within reach of any firm that has
one tech-savvy person—and this book). For example, you can migrate email from your current mail server
into Google Apps Email while preserving messages' date information, read/unread status, and the filing
system people have used to organize their messages.
Updates and bug fixes. Do you dread having to download and install program updates and patches
because of the havoc they sometimes wreak on your system? Well, say goodbye to that sinking feeling.
Since Google applications are on the Web, Google automatically takes care of updates and bug fixes for
you.
NOTE
Since Google apps are Web-based, Google can easily update and improve them—which it does all
the time. That means you don't have to wait for a new edition to come out to take advantage of
new features. It also means that what you see on your computer screen may be different from the
images in this book. Google makes so many changes, it's impossible to keep up!

Search. Not surprisingly, Google's Web-based services have some of the same searching power as its
famous find-anything-on-the-Web engine. That makes it easy for you to search your documents, email,
and more. For example, Gmail provides so much storage space ([click here]) that you may never have to
delete another email—and Gmail search makes it a snap to find any email in that haystack of messages.
Central administration. If you own or manage a domain (the address people use to find your Web site,
such as myvastdomain.com or ourcompany.com or statecollege.edu), then you can create a Google Apps
account, which, as Chapter 10 explains, brings together all Google's programs in one place for your
organization. Google Apps can be helpful for any collection of workers, no matter how big or small. With a
few clicks, a Google Apps administrator can set sharing policies across the whole domain, for example. So
you can decide whether to let people in your firm share their documents and calendar info with people
outside the domain (that is, the general public).
Working online or offline. In March 2008, Google rolled out a new feature: the ability to work offline in
Google Docs. Before that, one of the main complaints about Docs was that you had to be connected to the
Internet to use it. You could export files to another application, like Word or Excel, to work on them, but
then you'd have to remember to import the files to Docs again. But now you can work with Docs online or
off, without having to export anything. This is great if, say, you travel on business and need to work while
you're on a plane and don't have an Internet connection. The work you do offline gets uploaded
automatically next time you connect to the Internet. That way, any file in Docs is always the most recent
one. (You can revert to an older version if you want, but that's another story—one told on [click here].)
Security. You might be thinking, "Okay, Web applications sound great so far—but what about security?"
The idea of switching to Web-based programs makes some people nervous. After all, when you store
documents and information on your computer's hard disk or your company's servers, at least you know
where it is. What happens to files and data you store in Google apps?
Your data doesn't simply sit on some computer at Google's headquarters. Google operates a grid of
servers in many locations around the world. So instead of storing your data in one place, it distributes
your information across this grid, making it harder for hackers and other nasty types to get their mitts on
your info. Compare that strategy to keeping everything on your own computer: What happens if
somebody steals your laptop? Even if the thief can't crack the password and get your data, you still don't
have access to your files. Same goes if you drop your laptop in the pool.
NOTE
The practice of using Web-based applications and storing data in a "cloud" of networked servers is
called cloud computing.
Google takes data security very seriously. It has full-time security teams whose job it is to repel malicious
beasties like viruses, worms, and spam. Google's spam protection, for example, runs rings around some of
the other Web-based email services. Google uses a combination of sophisticated filters and user reporting
to keep spam out of your inbox. It's not perfect, but it's darn good—especially when you consider that
spam makes up about 90 percent of all the email whizzing around cyberspace.
Most Google apps also support SSL (secure sockets layer), which encrypts data to keep it secure. You
know you're in a secure mode when the URL in your Web browser's address bar starts with https://

instead of the usual http:// (think of that added "s" as standing for "security"). Whenever you sign into
your Google Account (which is how you access all of Google's offerings—see Chapter 1), you do so through
a secure connection—one that starts with https://—so no one can eavesdrop on your user name and
password.
If you're worried about the security of the data you transmit from your computer
into the Google cloud, you can make sure you connection is secure. Just type
https:// in front of the URL of the Google application you're using. For example,
connect to Gmail via https://mail.google.com or to Docs via
https://docs.google.com. The tradeoff? Performance is slightly slower when your
apps are piped over an SSL connection.
Privacy. Privacy's another issue related to security. You may have heard that Google scans incoming
email, looking for keywords, so it can display ads targeted to the email's content. Is that a violation of
privacy? Read the box on [click here] to decide. If privacy concerns you, take the time to read and
understand Google's privacy policy. The box on [click here] gives the highlights, but you can read the
whole thing at http://www.google.com/intl/en/privacypolicy.html.
Cost. When it comes to individual applications, you can't beat Google's price: They're free. Compare that
to the cost of any program you install on your computer (which doesn't have all the benefits of Web-based
applications).
If you're an IT manager (or you play one at your company) and want to sign up for a Google Apps
account, you have these choices (explained in more detail in Chapter 10):
Standard Edition is free.
Premier Edition costs $50 per year, per user. This edition offers some benefits that Standard
Edition doesn't have, such as email migration and 25 GB of email storage for each user.
Education Edition is also free. It offers many of the benefits of the Premier Edition, but is available
only to educational institutions (who have a domain name ending in .edu) and nonprofits with
federal 501 (c)(3) status.
For a comparison of the different editions of Google Apps for organizations,
see the box on [click here].
P2.2. What You Get with Google Apps
So what is Google Apps? A lot of people use the term loosely, meaning just about any Web-based program
Google offers. But, technically speaking, they're wrong. Google Apps (see Figure P2-1) is actually a specific
collection of Google products and services that the company offers to other organizations. Here's a breakdown
of what you get if you sign up for Google Apps:

Google Docs (Chapters 2–4). Create, edit, and share documents online—and work on them when you're
offline, too. Docs lets you create and work with word processor documents, spreadsheets, and slideshow-
style presentations. You can do so much with Docs that this book devotes three chapters to it: one for
each kind of document.
Figure P2-1. On the Google Apps home page, you can create a Google Apps account for your
organization.
NOTE
As the Note on [click here] explains, this book uses the term apps to describe these individual
Google services, which are available to anyone, even those whose firms haven't signed up for
Google Apps.
Gmail (a.k.a. Google Apps Email—Chapter 5). Google's Web-based email program offers oodles of
storage space, labels to keep your messages organized, and the ability to search and filter your email.
Google Talk (Chapter 6). Talk is Google's instant-messaging service. You can chat with friends and
colleagues, see who's online, and invite the whole gang to a chat as a group.
Google Calendar (Chapter 7). Keep yourself on schedule with this event-management application. You
can create multiple calendars, schedule events (you can invite others to join you), and share your
calendars with friends and family, colleagues—or the whole world.

Page Creator (Chapter 9). Design your own Web pages and post them online—for free—with Page
Creator, Google's Web page editor.
Control Panel (Chapter 10). The Control Panel is where Google Apps administrators customize all the
programs their firms use, and manage individual employee accounts.
Start Page (Chapter 11). Google Apps administrators can design a custom home page for everyone in
their organizations with Start Page. For example, you can put your company's logo at the top, include
announcements, and insert gadgets (mini-applications you can embed on a Web page) to give users one-
click access to their Google apps. Various gadgets let folks keep an eye on their Gmail inboxes, access
collections of important documents, check appointments, and chat with coworkers. And people can
customize their own Start Pages to suit their working styles.
NOTE
Start Page is similar to iGoogle (Chapter 8), Google's customizable search page that's available to
the general public ([click here] lays out the differences between iGoogle and Start Page).
Google Sites (Chapter 12). Google Sites lets you create a collaborative Web site that a bunch of people
can work on—add content to, edit, and so on—at the same time.
NOTE
Unlike the other apps in this list, which have versions anyone can sign up for (no need for a Google
Apps account), Google Sites is available only through a Google Apps account.
More Google Stuff
Doesn't Google offer other applications and services, too? What are they?
Google offers a ton of products and services, from Alerts to YouTube to Blogger to Web
Accelerator. To see them all, go to www.google.com and click "more"
"even more". Some of
these services, like searching, you can just go ahead and use without logging into anything; others
require a Google Account (Chapter 1 tells you all about that).
Here's a list of some popular and useful Google services (none of which are covered in this book,
in the interest of keeping this volume under 5,000 pages):

Blogger (http://www.blogger.com). Keep an online journal or sound off on politics,
entertainment, or social issues. A blog (short for Web log) is a Web page that contains
regularly updated posts about whatever's on the blogger's mind.
Google Earth (http://earth.google.com). Google Earth is a virtual globe that uses satellite
images and maps to give you a bird's-eye view of the world in 3-D.
Google Groups (http://groups.google.com). On this site, you can read, create, and
participate in online discussion groups. (You'll find Google Groups dedicated to discussing all
the Google apps.)
Orkut (http://www.orkut.com). This social networking site is Google's answer to MySpace
and Facebook. Mainly unheard of in America, it's wildly popular in Brazil.
Google Reader (http://www.google.com/reader). Google reader helps you stay up-to-the-
minute with your favorite blogs and news sites, bringing them all together on a single page.
Picasa (http://picasa.google.com). Store, organize, and share digital photos on the Web
with Picasa. Many Google apps let you easily insert a picture—or even a slideshow—from
Picasa.
SketchUp (http://sketchup.google.com). SketchUp lets you create 3-D models, and then
put them in Google Earth.
Google Notebook (http://www.google.com/notebook). With Google Notebook, you can
save, organize, and share clips—snippets of interesting Web sites—in an online notebook as
you surf the Web.
YouTube (http://www.youtube.com). This is the Web's most popular place to post, watch,
organize, and discuss video clips. You can embed YouTube videos in Google Sites ([click
here]).
Want to see what Google's working on for the future? Check out Google Labs at
http://labs.google.com, Google's "technology playground." It's a place to get a glimpse at up-and-
coming Google products and services that aren't quite fully cooked.
NOTE
A lot of the products Google offers, including many of the applications covered in this book, have the
word "beta" next to their logos. Normally, programs still in the beta (testing) stage aren't released to the
public. But Google has a different philosophy: They like to release programs they're still working on, so

people can try them out and suggest improvements. Google is still actively changing many of the
applications described here, so don't be surprised if a program looks and acts a bit differently than what
you read in this book.
P2.2.1. Individual Applications Versus a Google Apps Account
The hardest thing you ever face about Google Apps could be the decision of what to sign up for. Should you just
use several of the individual applications or the whole shebang of a Google Apps account? The following
scenarios may help you decide:
You don't own a domain name—www.MyGreatCompany.com or www.SavingTheWorld.org—and
you don't want one. You need to be a moderately tech savvy individual who owns or manages a domain
name (and its collection of related Web addresses) to create a Google Apps account. Sign up for some
individual apps if you don't fall into this category.
Your boss told you you're switching to Google Apps. If you got a memo saying everyone will be
using Gmail, Google Docs, and Google Calendar from now on, then your organization has probably already
set up a Google Apps account for you, so you don't have to choose. All you have to do is sign in and start
using the individual applications. (Read Chapters 2–9 so you can beat everyone else out of the starting
gate.)
You want to use a Google application (or two or three) for personal stuff. If you just want to use
Google's services for personal stuff, you don't need the centralized domain administration you get with
Google Apps. Simply pick and choose the applications you want, and sign up for them individually. (Start
by creating a free Google Account—Chapter 1 tells you how.)
NOTE
If your company uses Google Apps, you can still create your own Google Account with a unique
user name and password. That way, you can use your company's Google Apps account for work,
and your personal Google Account for fun.
You want to use Web-based applications for your business. Google Apps offers businesses a
boatload of benefits: a network without the costs of setting it up and maintaining it, centralized
management of all your applications, shared contact lists, and, of course, the applications themselves.
Icing on the cake is that all these offerings get listed at a custom Web address reflecting your
organization's domain name, such as sites.yourcompany.com for Google Sites or mail.yourcollege.edu for
student and staff email.
You want to create a Web site for a group. Say you want to create a Web site for your neighborhood
association. With a Google Apps account, not only can you create a Web site, you can also give email
accounts to key organizers, and let everyone create and share documents related to the group's
business—from monthly meeting agendas to the annual block party. Sign up for Google Apps Standard
Edition ([click here]), and you get all that (and more) for free—you just pay for registering a domain name
([click here]), which costs you about 10 bucks a year.

You're a student with an email address ending in .edu. Sign up for Google Apps Team Edition (for
free), and you can collaborate with others your school. The box on [click here] tells you all about Team
Edition.
P2.3. Google Apps and Your Business
With Google Apps, your company can spend less time and less money managing IT services. Google takes care
of all the hassles of handling email, worrying about security, and holding spam at bay. Google's own 10,000-
plus employees rely on Google Apps to keep their business running. And if it's good enough for Google, it might
be good enough for your firm, too.
Google Apps comes in two main flavors: the Standard Edition and the Premier Edition. Both offer the same set
of applications for your users. The box on [click here] breaks down the nitty-gritty differences between these
two editions, but here's what it boils down to:
Standard Edition. This edition of Google Apps is free. You get all the apps, 6 GB of storage per person, a
control center for administrators, work-anywhere mobility, and the great collaboration tools that make
Google Apps so impressive.
Premier Edition. This edition of Google Apps costs $50 per user per year. When you think of what your
organization can save in time, licensing fees, hardware and software maintenance and upgrades, it's a
great deal. Premier Edition offers all the goodies that come with Standard Edition, plus some extras. Here
are the highlights: 25 GB of email storage per person, email migration from your current system, free
phone support, APIs to integrate Google Apps with your current system (including single sign-on and user
provisioning), email policy management and message recovery. (See Chapter 12 for the lowdown on all
that geekery.)
Not sure? You can try out Premier Edition with a 30-day free trial. If you decide it's not what you need, switch
over to Standard Edition before the 30 days are up.
P2.4. What You Need to Get Started
Getting started is easy. Google has designed its applications to be both accessible and easy to use. It takes only
a few seconds to sign up and start using your first program. You just need a Web browser (the more recent, the
better) and an Internet connection. (Different apps have different browser requirements, so those get covered
in the relevant chapters.) Read on to learn the basics you need to set things up.
P2.4.1. For Individual Apps: A Google Account
If you're going to sign up for a few individual applications—or even a whole bunch—you need a Google Account.
Some applications create a Google Account for you as part of the sign-up process, but it's a good idea to start
by signing up for a Google Account, because it gives you access to all the apps. Point your Web browser to
www.google.com/accounts, and then turn to Chapter 1 to sign up.
P2.4.2. For Google Apps for Your Organization: A Google Apps Account
If you're a domain administrator (that is, you manage the domain name your organization owns) and you want
to use Google Apps for your organization, first you have to create a Google Apps account for your domain (see

Chapter 10). From there, you can create accounts for your users, and customize your domain's apps the way
you want them, as explained in Chapter 11 and Chapter 13.
P2.4.3. Browser Requirements
To sign up for a Google Account, your browser has to meet these minimum requirements:
Internet Explorer 5.5 or higher for Windows
Netscape 7.1 or higher for Windows, Mac, or Linux
Mozilla 1.4 or higher for Windows, Mac, or Linux
Firefox 0.8 or higher for Windows, Mac, or Linux
Safari 1.2.1 or higher for Mac
Each Google app has its own browser requirements, so some of the browsers in this list may not work with a
particular application. Check the chapter devoted to the app you want to use for more detailed browser
requirements.
To find out which version of a Web browser you're using, open your browser and, on its
menu bar, click Help
About. (Except for Safari, where you need to click Safari
About Safari.)
If you've got the right browser, you're nine-tenths of the way there. Just a few other things to check:
Make sure you've got JavaScript turned on in your browser. JavaScript lets your browser run
programming code that makes Web pages more interactive. (If you're not sure whether your browser has
JavaScript turned on—most of them do—see the box on [click here].)
Make sure that your Web browser accepts cookies. We're not talking chocolate chip or oatmeal here.
Cookies are small text files that Web sites download onto your computer; they help customize your visits
to the sites. (The box on [click here] tells you how to set your browser to accept cookies.)
NOTE
If you're a Mac fan, Google apps work best if you use Mozilla/Firefox as your Web browser. Not all apps
work with Safari or the Mac version of Internet Explorer.

Up to Speed: When Java(Script) and Cookies Don't Mean a Coffee Break
To use Google apps, you need to have both JavaScript and cookies ([click here]) enabled in your
Web browser. Your browser probably came with both activated, but it doesn't hurt to double-
check.
To flick on JavaScript in Internet Explorer version 5.5 or higher, follow these steps:
Select Tools
Internet Options.
The Internet Options box opens.
1.
Click the Security tab. In the "Security level for this zone" section, click the Custom Level
button.
A Security Settings box opens. This box has a long list of options.
2.
Scroll down the list to the Scripting section. Under "Active scripting", make sure that Enable
is turned on. If it's not, turn it on. Click OK.
If you changed "Active scripting" from Disable or Prompt to Enable, Internet Explorer asks if
you really want to change its security settings. (If you didn't make any changes, you don't
see this confirmation box.)
3.
Click Yes.
IE takes you back to the Internet Options box. Click OK to close the box, and then return to
what you were doing. Now you've got JavaScript working for you.
For browsers based on Mozilla (these include Firefox 1.6+ and Netscape 7.1+), you enable
or disable JavaScript starting with Edit on the menu bar:
4.
Select Edit
Preferences.
The Preferences box opens.
1.
In the left-hand Category menu, next to Advanced, click the + sign, and then click Scripts &
Plug-ins.
The Scripts & Plug-ins pane appears.
2.
Under "Enable JavaScript for", make sure that the checkbox next to Navigator is turned on.
If it isn't, click the box to insert a checkmark, and then click OK.
3.

Congratulations—you've enabled JavaScript.
Now for the cookies. Internet Explorer 5 handles these a little differently from IE 6. If you're
working with IE 5.5, follow steps 1 and 2 above for opening the Internet Explorer Security
Settings box. In the Security Settings list (step 3), scroll down to Cookies. For "Allow cookies
that are stored on your computer," make sure Enable is turned on. Then continue with step
4.
For IE 6 or later, here's how to turn on cookies:
Select Tools
Internet Options.
The Internet Options box appears.
1.
Click the Privacy tab. In the middle of the box, you see a slider that corresponds to your
browser's cookie settings. Make sure that the slider's at Medium; if it's not, move the slider
to the Medium setting. (This setting lets your computer accept cookies from Google apps
while protecting it from third-party cookies, which marketers often use to collect information
about your Web-surfing habits. Third-party cookies arrive at your computer from some Web
site other than the one you're viewing.) Click OK.
IE saves your settings, and then returns you to the Web page you were looking at.
In Mozilla/Firefox, you manage cookies using the aptly named Cookie Manager. And you do
so in one easy step: Surf on over to the app you want. In Mozilla, select Tools
Cookie
Manager
"Allow Cookies from this Site".
2.
Last but not least: Safari. Go to Safari
Preferences, and then click the Security tab. Turn on the
checkbox next to "Enable JavaScript" and, in the "Accept cookies" section, select the radio button
next to "Only from sites you navigate to". That's it. Easy, huh?
P2.5. About this Book
This book is designed for both the people who use Google's applications and the administrators who manage a
Google Apps account. So the first nine chapters tell you how to set up a personal Google Account (Chapter 1)
and get the most out of each app:
Google Docs:
Word processing (Chapter 2)
Spreadsheets (Chapter 3)
Presentations (Chapter 4)

Gmail (Chapter 5)
Google Talk (Chapter 6)
Google Calendar (Chapter 7)
iGoogle (Chapter 8)
Page Creator (Chapter 9)
Whether you're using these applications for personal projects or through an organization's Google Apps account,
you can dip in anywhere and get up to speed fast. Each chapter offers tips and tricks to get you working in no
time.
Chapter 10 through Chapter 12 are all about Google Apps accounts: how to get signed up and set up (Chapter
10), and how to do the day-to-day administrative tasks that go with managing a domain (Chapter 11).
Google Sites, a relatively new addition to Google Apps, is available only through Google Apps accounts, so that's
covered in the later part of the book (Chapter 12), as well. Whether you're an admin or a regular user, Chapter
12 tells you how to create, build, and share a site with others in your organization.
Chapter 13 talks about stuff you can add to Google Apps to customize it and make it do more. Whether you're a
business looking to tailor Google Apps to your organization or a just-for-fun user who wants to write a cool new
gadget ([click here]), this chapter gives you the info you need to get started.
Finally, an appendix lists keyboard shortcuts that can help you work with Google apps faster and more
efficiently.
P2.6. The Very Basics
You'll find very little jargon or nerd terminology in this book. You will, however, run across a few terms and
concepts that you'll encounter frequently in your computing life:
Clicking. This book gives you three kinds of instructions that require you to use your computer's mouse
or trackpad. To click means to point the arrow cursor at something on the screen and then—without
moving the cursor at all—to press and release the clicker button on the left side of the mouse (or laptop
trackpad). To right-click means to point the cursor and click the button on the right side of the mouse (or
trackpad); Mac users with only one mouse button can replicate this maneuver by hitting the Control key
while they're clicking. And to drag means to move the cursor while pressing the button continuously.
Menus. The menus are the words at the top of your browser: File, Edit, and so on. You also find menus
within some of the Google applications—they typically appear near the top of your screen. Click one to
make a list of commands appear, as though they're written on a window shade you've just pulled down.

Some people click and release the mouse button to open a menu, and then, after reading the menu
command choices, click again on the one they want. Other people like to hold down the mouse button
continuously after the initial click on the menu title, drag down the list to the desired command, and only
then release the mouse button. Either method works fine.
Keyboard shortcuts. Every time you take your hand off the keyboard to move the mouse, you lose time
and potentially disrupt your workflow. That's why many experienced computer fans use keystroke
combinations instead of menu commands whenever possible. Ctrl+B (
-B on a Mac), for example, is a
keyboard shortcut for boldface type in most word processing programs.
When you see a shortcut like Ctrl+Shift (
-Shift) (which lets you select a range of options from a list), it's
telling you to hold down the Ctrl or 
 key, and, while it's down, press the Shift key, and then release both
keys.
P2.6.1. About
These
Arrows
Throughout this book, and throughout the Missing Manual series, you'll find sentences like this one: "Select File
Export
.csv." That's shorthand for a much longer instruction that directs you to open three nested
commands in sequence, like this: "In your browser, you'll find a menu item called File. Click that. On the File
menu is an option called Export; click it to open it. On that menu is yet another option called ".csv". Click it to
open that, too." This kind of arrow shorthand helps to simplify the business of choosing commands in menus, as
shown in Figure P2-2.
Figure P2-2. In this book, arrow notations help to simplify folder and menu instructions. For
example, "Select File
Export
.csv" is a more compact way of explaining the actions shown here
than saying, "From the File menu, select Export. From the submenu that appears, choose .csv."

Part 1: Docs: Google's Productivity Suite
Chapter 1
Chapter 2
Chapter 3
Chapter 4
Chapter 1. Getting Started with Google Apps
A Google Account is your passport to the Google apps universe. It gives you a way to sign in just once and
access all of Google's goodies. It's also where you add new programs, change your name or password, and do
other across-the-board management. And here's the best part: A Google Account is free. As in totally,
completely, won't-cost-you-a-dime free.
If you've created an account for any Google offering—like Gmail, Google Docs, or Google Calendar—you've
already got a Google Account. So you can skip the section on signing up and turn to [click here] to learn more
about what you can do with your account.
On the other hand, maybe you've made it well into the 21st Century without a Google Account, thank you very
much. If that's the case, your time has come: You need an account to use Gmail, Google Docs, Google
Calendar, and many other Google tools. In addition, when you're signed into your Google Account, you can
customize your apps, check out recommendations made just for you, and get even better search results. This
chapter shows you how to get started.
NOTE
The bulk of this chapter addresses the boring but necessary sign-up procedures required to uncork the
Google apps magic. If you've already got a Google Account, or consider account sign-up guidance a
crutch needed only by lesser mortals, feel free to skip ahead to Chapter 2, where the heart of the Google
apps coverage begins.
1.1. Signing Up for a Google Account
It takes only a couple of minutes—you can pop a celebratory pizza in the microwave and be done before the
timer dings. Then, as you munch on a slice or two, you just have to pick which programs you want to use, and
add a bit of personal info.

NOTE
If you use Google Apps through your organization—for example, if you sign into Gmail with a user name
that looks like myname@mycompany.com—you don't need to create a separate Google Account. Your
organization creates and manages your apps through its own Web site. (See Chapter 10 for more
information about Google Apps for organizations.)
Start by going to Google's home page (http://www.google.com) and, in the upper-right corner, click the link
that says, "Sign in". Alternatively, you can go straight to the Google Accounts sign-in page at
http://www.google.com/accounts.
Whichever route you take, the Google Accounts sign-in page looks like Figure 1-1. After you've opened your
account, you'll see this page again whenever you want to sign in and use your Google services. For now,
though, click the right-hand "Create an account now" link, and you're taken to the page shown in Figure 1-2.
Figure 1-1. Clicking the "Sign in" link on Google's home page takes you here. The left-hand side of
the page tempts you with various programs you can use once you sign up. The right-hand side is
where you'll sign into the Google Account you're about to create. To get started, click "Create an
account now" (circled).

If you have questions about Google Accounts before (or even after) you sign up, more
help awaits at www.google.com/support/accounts.
Figure 1-2. Here's the page you fill out to create a new account. It asks for pretty basic info: You
supply an email address, a password, and your country, and then fill out the spam-preventing word
verification box (you can't see it here) and agree to Google's terms of service (see the box on [click
here]).

Google's sign-up form is simple; you can fill it out and start using your new Google Account in mere seconds.
Here's what's on it:
Your current email address. Type in the email address you use right now, like johndoe@yahoo.com or
janesmith@mycompany.com. (After you've read Chapter 5, you'll probably want to switch to Gmail, but
you can open a Google Account using any working email address.)
Choose a password. Your Google Account password has to be at least eight characters long and can
contain letters, numbers, and symbols. See the box below for tips on creating a good password.
Re-enter password. Nothing is more annoying than locking yourself out because you entered a typo
when creating your password—and now you have no clue what the password is. To make sure that doesn't
happen, retype your password here (don't copy and paste it from the box above—that'll just duplicate any
typos).

Word to the Wise: Password Primer
Since your Google Account is the central sign-in for all your Google apps (meaning you use the
same user name and password for everything), you want to make sure that your password is extra
secure so no one can get into your email, calendar, and personal documents in one fell swoop. So
put a bit of thought into selecting your password. Here are some ways to make your password
tough to crack:
Go for a little variety. You probably already have a bunch of different passwords for a
bunch of different purposes: email, online shopping, sites like Facebook, and so on. Instead
of recycling one of those passwords, create a brand-new one just for your Google Account.
That way, if somebody learns your Facebook password, for example, your Google Account is
still secure.
Avoid the obvious. Don't make your user name ([click here]) double as your password.
Similarly, don't use googleapps, googleaccount, or password as your password. Those words
might be easy for you to remember, but they're just as easy for someone else to guess.
Think outside the dictionary. Don't use a word that appears in the dictionary (English or
any other language). Instead, use a combination of letters, numbers, and symbols. One way
to create a password that's easy for you to remember but hard for someone else to guess is
to substitute numbers or symbols for letters they resemble. For example, instead of
stanford, try st@nf0rd. And, for heaven's sake, don't use the word "password" in any form.
Combine upper- and lowercase letters. When it comes to your password, Google
distinguishes between capital letters and lowercase ones. Use this to your advantage: go
with LuCKygiRl instead of luckygirl.
Go big. Google requires that your password be at least eight characters long—and that's a
good start. The longer a password is, the harder it is to guess. So add a few more characters
beyond the minimum eight to make your password even more secure.
Remember me on this computer. If you're setting up your account on a computer nobody else uses,
turn on this checkbox to save a little sign-in time. Google responds by automatically filling in your login
info every time you visit the sign-in screen. But if you're on a shared computer (at a public library, for
example), leave this box turned off so no one else can get into your account.
Enable Web History. When you're signed in to your Google Account, Web History keeps track of your
searches as you wander around the Web. When you sign up, Google turns it on by default, and that means
you can take a look back at sites you've visited, search them, and get personalized Search results based
on your history. Since you can access your Web History from any computer with an Internet connection,
it's like having a permanently handy record of all the searches you've ever done. The box on [click here]
has more about Web History to help you decide whether you want it in your Google Account.
Location. From the drop-down list, choose your country.

Word verification. You may have seen similar combinations of wavy, skewed letters (and sometimes
numbers) on other Web pages. Word verification makes sure you're a real, live person, not an automated
"bot" that crawls the Web and signs up for accounts to use for spamming and other nefarious purposes.
Take a look at those wavy letters, filter them through your human brain, and type them into the box
(capitalization doesn't matter).
Terms of Service. You've got to agree to Google's terms of service if you want to open an account. Give
them a quick read, or check out the box on [click here] for the highlights.
When you've filled everything out, give the page a quick once-over to make sure it all looks good. Then click "I
accept. Create my account." Google sends you a verification email like the one in Figure 1-3. Click the link in
the email and your account is up and running. (If clicking the link doesn't do anything, copy the link and paste it
into your browser's address bar.) Your browser opens a page that says Google has verified your account. From
here, click the link to go to your brand-new Google Account.
Figure 1-3. Google sends you a verification email like this one to make sure you're not a spam bot.
To complete the sign-up process, click the link (circled), or copy and paste it into your Web
browser's address bar. Make sure you do one or the other—Google won't set up your account until
you verify your email address.
NOTE

Don't reply to the verification email. If you do, your email will get lost in cyberspace, since nobody at
Google looks at or replies to these verification emails. Instead, look for answers at the Google Accounts
Help page: www.google.com/support/accounts. Better yet, keep reading this book.
Frequently Asked Question: Google Web History
What exactly is Web History—and do I want to be a part of it?
When you sign up for a Google Account, the registration form gives you the option to turn off
Google Web History. Google obviously likes Web History—it's automatically turned on. But what is
Web History? And will you like it as much as Google does?
When you're signed into your Google Account, Web History tracks your searches as you zoom
around the Web. By tracking and remembering what you searched, Web History lets you easily
find Web pages you've visited. You can also search across sites in your Web History, for those
times when you just know you saw a great recipe for hazelnut torte but can't for the life of you
remember where. Web History also uses this track record to personalize your Google search
results. Based on the searches you've done, Google returns results that will most likely interest
you. So if you go to a lot of cooking sites, for example, recipes will get ranked higher in your
search results than news stories.
The info stored in your Web History record offers a nice trend tracker when it comes to your own
Web usage. For example, Web History highlights the sites you visit most often and makes it easy
to view your own personal top searches.
So what's the catch? Maybe there isn't one—it all depends on how jealously you guard your
privacy. To track your Web History, Google stores all that information on its own computers.
Google insists it takes your privacy seriously: The only way to view your Web History is to sign
into your account. You can also temporarily stop tracking your online movements by pausing your
Web History (from your Google Account page, select Web History
Pause), and you can remove
sites and searches from this digital popcorn trail by going to Web History
Remove items.
In sum, Web History can be a handy tool. But if you're uncomfortable having Google follow you
around the Web, you probably shouldn't turn it on. If Web History is turned on, and you decide
you want to make it history, then follow the steps for deleting a Google app on [click here].
If the verification email doesn't show up (it can take mere seconds, but give it at least 15 minutes before going
to Plan B), you've got a few options:
Check your spam folder. Whatever your email provider calls it—Spam, Junk, Bulk Mail—it's possible
your Google Accounts verification email landed there by mistake.
Tell your spam filter Google's cool. If the verification email isn't in your spam folder, it may have been
blocked by your overzealous spam filter. To make sure the verification email gets through, add this

address to your address book: accounts-noreply@google.com.
Request another verification email. If you can't find the verification anywhere in your email program,
point your browser to www.google.com/accounts and try to sign in anyway. The Account Verification Page
appears, where you see a message like this: "To have the verification email resent, click here." Click the
link to have Google send another verification email.
Start from square one. Everyone makes mistakes. You may have mistyped your email address when
you signed up. Try again, following the instructions on [click here]. (And this time, triple-check to make
sure you haven't made any typos on the Create an Account page.)

Chapter 1. Getting Started with Google Apps
A Google Account is your passport to the Google apps universe. It gives you a way to sign in just once and
access all of Google's goodies. It's also where you add new programs, change your name or password, and do
other across-the-board management. And here's the best part: A Google Account is free. As in totally,
completely, won't-cost-you-a-dime free.
If you've created an account for any Google offering—like Gmail, Google Docs, or Google Calendar—you've
already got a Google Account. So you can skip the section on signing up and turn to [click here] to learn more
about what you can do with your account.
On the other hand, maybe you've made it well into the 21st Century without a Google Account, thank you very
much. If that's the case, your time has come: You need an account to use Gmail, Google Docs, Google
Calendar, and many other Google tools. In addition, when you're signed into your Google Account, you can
customize your apps, check out recommendations made just for you, and get even better search results. This
chapter shows you how to get started.
NOTE
The bulk of this chapter addresses the boring but necessary sign-up procedures required to uncork the
Google apps magic. If you've already got a Google Account, or consider account sign-up guidance a
crutch needed only by lesser mortals, feel free to skip ahead to Chapter 2, where the heart of the Google
apps coverage begins.
1.1. Signing Up for a Google Account
It takes only a couple of minutes—you can pop a celebratory pizza in the microwave and be done before the
timer dings. Then, as you munch on a slice or two, you just have to pick which programs you want to use, and
add a bit of personal info.

NOTE
If you use Google Apps through your organization—for example, if you sign into Gmail with a user name
that looks like myname@mycompany.com—you don't need to create a separate Google Account. Your
organization creates and manages your apps through its own Web site. (See Chapter 10 for more
information about Google Apps for organizations.)
Start by going to Google's home page (http://www.google.com) and, in the upper-right corner, click the link
that says, "Sign in". Alternatively, you can go straight to the Google Accounts sign-in page at
http://www.google.com/accounts.
Whichever route you take, the Google Accounts sign-in page looks like Figure 1-1. After you've opened your
account, you'll see this page again whenever you want to sign in and use your Google services. For now,
though, click the right-hand "Create an account now" link, and you're taken to the page shown in Figure 1-2.
Figure 1-1. Clicking the "Sign in" link on Google's home page takes you here. The left-hand side of
the page tempts you with various programs you can use once you sign up. The right-hand side is
where you'll sign into the Google Account you're about to create. To get started, click "Create an
account now" (circled).

If you have questions about Google Accounts before (or even after) you sign up, more
help awaits at www.google.com/support/accounts.
Figure 1-2. Here's the page you fill out to create a new account. It asks for pretty basic info: You
supply an email address, a password, and your country, and then fill out the spam-preventing word
verification box (you can't see it here) and agree to Google's terms of service (see the box on [click
here]).

Google's sign-up form is simple; you can fill it out and start using your new Google Account in mere seconds.
Here's what's on it:
Your current email address. Type in the email address you use right now, like johndoe@yahoo.com or
janesmith@mycompany.com. (After you've read Chapter 5, you'll probably want to switch to Gmail, but
you can open a Google Account using any working email address.)
Choose a password. Your Google Account password has to be at least eight characters long and can
contain letters, numbers, and symbols. See the box below for tips on creating a good password.
Re-enter password. Nothing is more annoying than locking yourself out because you entered a typo
when creating your password—and now you have no clue what the password is. To make sure that doesn't
happen, retype your password here (don't copy and paste it from the box above—that'll just duplicate any
typos).

Word to the Wise: Password Primer
Since your Google Account is the central sign-in for all your Google apps (meaning you use the
same user name and password for everything), you want to make sure that your password is extra
secure so no one can get into your email, calendar, and personal documents in one fell swoop. So
put a bit of thought into selecting your password. Here are some ways to make your password
tough to crack:
Go for a little variety. You probably already have a bunch of different passwords for a
bunch of different purposes: email, online shopping, sites like Facebook, and so on. Instead
of recycling one of those passwords, create a brand-new one just for your Google Account.
That way, if somebody learns your Facebook password, for example, your Google Account is
still secure.
Avoid the obvious. Don't make your user name ([click here]) double as your password.
Similarly, don't use googleapps, googleaccount, or password as your password. Those words
might be easy for you to remember, but they're just as easy for someone else to guess.
Think outside the dictionary. Don't use a word that appears in the dictionary (English or
any other language). Instead, use a combination of letters, numbers, and symbols. One way
to create a password that's easy for you to remember but hard for someone else to guess is
to substitute numbers or symbols for letters they resemble. For example, instead of
stanford, try st@nf0rd. And, for heaven's sake, don't use the word "password" in any form.
Combine upper- and lowercase letters. When it comes to your password, Google
distinguishes between capital letters and lowercase ones. Use this to your advantage: go
with LuCKygiRl instead of luckygirl.
Go big. Google requires that your password be at least eight characters long—and that's a
good start. The longer a password is, the harder it is to guess. So add a few more characters
beyond the minimum eight to make your password even more secure.
Remember me on this computer. If you're setting up your account on a computer nobody else uses,
turn on this checkbox to save a little sign-in time. Google responds by automatically filling in your login
info every time you visit the sign-in screen. But if you're on a shared computer (at a public library, for
example), leave this box turned off so no one else can get into your account.
Enable Web History. When you're signed in to your Google Account, Web History keeps track of your
searches as you wander around the Web. When you sign up, Google turns it on by default, and that means
you can take a look back at sites you've visited, search them, and get personalized Search results based
on your history. Since you can access your Web History from any computer with an Internet connection,
it's like having a permanently handy record of all the searches you've ever done. The box on [click here]
has more about Web History to help you decide whether you want it in your Google Account.
Location. From the drop-down list, choose your country.

Word verification. You may have seen similar combinations of wavy, skewed letters (and sometimes
numbers) on other Web pages. Word verification makes sure you're a real, live person, not an automated
"bot" that crawls the Web and signs up for accounts to use for spamming and other nefarious purposes.
Take a look at those wavy letters, filter them through your human brain, and type them into the box
(capitalization doesn't matter).
Terms of Service. You've got to agree to Google's terms of service if you want to open an account. Give
them a quick read, or check out the box on [click here] for the highlights.
When you've filled everything out, give the page a quick once-over to make sure it all looks good. Then click "I
accept. Create my account." Google sends you a verification email like the one in Figure 1-3. Click the link in
the email and your account is up and running. (If clicking the link doesn't do anything, copy the link and paste it
into your browser's address bar.) Your browser opens a page that says Google has verified your account. From
here, click the link to go to your brand-new Google Account.
Figure 1-3. Google sends you a verification email like this one to make sure you're not a spam bot.
To complete the sign-up process, click the link (circled), or copy and paste it into your Web
browser's address bar. Make sure you do one or the other—Google won't set up your account until
you verify your email address.
NOTE

Don't reply to the verification email. If you do, your email will get lost in cyberspace, since nobody at
Google looks at or replies to these verification emails. Instead, look for answers at the Google Accounts
Help page: www.google.com/support/accounts. Better yet, keep reading this book.
Frequently Asked Question: Google Web History
What exactly is Web History—and do I want to be a part of it?
When you sign up for a Google Account, the registration form gives you the option to turn off
Google Web History. Google obviously likes Web History—it's automatically turned on. But what is
Web History? And will you like it as much as Google does?
When you're signed into your Google Account, Web History tracks your searches as you zoom
around the Web. By tracking and remembering what you searched, Web History lets you easily
find Web pages you've visited. You can also search across sites in your Web History, for those
times when you just know you saw a great recipe for hazelnut torte but can't for the life of you
remember where. Web History also uses this track record to personalize your Google search
results. Based on the searches you've done, Google returns results that will most likely interest
you. So if you go to a lot of cooking sites, for example, recipes will get ranked higher in your
search results than news stories.
The info stored in your Web History record offers a nice trend tracker when it comes to your own
Web usage. For example, Web History highlights the sites you visit most often and makes it easy
to view your own personal top searches.
So what's the catch? Maybe there isn't one—it all depends on how jealously you guard your
privacy. To track your Web History, Google stores all that information on its own computers.
Google insists it takes your privacy seriously: The only way to view your Web History is to sign
into your account. You can also temporarily stop tracking your online movements by pausing your
Web History (from your Google Account page, select Web History
Pause), and you can remove
sites and searches from this digital popcorn trail by going to Web History
Remove items.
In sum, Web History can be a handy tool. But if you're uncomfortable having Google follow you
around the Web, you probably shouldn't turn it on. If Web History is turned on, and you decide
you want to make it history, then follow the steps for deleting a Google app on [click here].
If the verification email doesn't show up (it can take mere seconds, but give it at least 15 minutes before going
to Plan B), you've got a few options:
Check your spam folder. Whatever your email provider calls it—Spam, Junk, Bulk Mail—it's possible

you signed up. Try again, following the instructions on [click here]. (And this time, triple-check to make
sure you haven't made any typos on the Create an Account page.)
 

 
1.2. You're All Signed Up—Now What?
You can sign into your new Google Account by going to Google's home page and clicking the upper-right "Sign
in" link, or by going to www.google.com/accounts. Just enter the email address you used to create the account,
along with your password, and then click the "Sign in" button.
NOTE
If you already have Gmail, you can sign into your Google Account with your Gmail user name, which is
the part of your Gmail address that comes before @gmail.com. So if your Gmail address is
janedoe@gmail.com, your user name is janedoe.
The first time you sign in, you see a page that looks something like Figure 1-4.
Figure 1-4. Your Google Account page is split into three sections. On the left, Personal Information
lets you view and edit the info associated with your account (flip to [click here] for the lowdown on
managing these details). On the right, under the "My services" heading, Google shows which
programs you're currently signed up for. Below that, under "Try something new", is a list of other
Google products you can sign up for—just click a link to get started. The links in the upper-right
(circled) let you jump to different parts of your account, get help, or sign out.

At the top of the page, Google displays the email address or user name you used to sign in. (You can change
your email address or user name by editing your personal information; see [click here].)
NOTE
You can have more than one Google Account—for example, maybe you want one Gmail address for work
and another for personal stuff—but Google lets you sign into only one account at a time.
The links in the top-right part of the page help you find your way around your Google Account:
Google Home. Click this link to go to the familiar Google search page (www.google.com).
Help. Lost? Confused? Got a quick question? Clicking Help takes you to the Google Accounts Help page,
which covers all the ins and outs of using your account.

NOTE
Where the Help link takes you depends on the Google app you're using when you click it. If you're
using Gmail, for example, it takes you to the Gmail Help page. To get to Google Accounts Help,
click the Help link while you're on the page pictured in Figure 1-4, or go to
www.google.com/support/accounts.
My Account. Clicking this link brings you back to the page shown in Figure 1-4.
Sign Out. When you're ready to say buh-bye to Google apps, click this link.
The rest of your Google Account page is divided into three sections:
Personal information. Here's the info you gave Google when signing up for your account. To manage
these details—to change your name, say—click the Edit link. You also get links for changing your email
address and password.
My services. This section lists Google apps for which you're currently signed up. Click the name of any
program to launch it, or click Edit to delete a program ([click here]) or close your account ([click here]).
Try something new. In this section, Google tempts you with any offerings you haven't signed up
for—yet. If you're ready to take the plunge, click the name of whatever you're interested in. Click the More
link to see the whole smorgasbord of Google products and services you can choose among.
Troubleshooting Moment: Help—I Can't Get into My Account!
Since your Google Account is the central sign-in for all the Google apps you use, if you're shut out
of your Google Account, you're shut out of everything. If you're having trouble signing in, click the
"I cannot access my account" link at the bottom of the sign-in box to get help. On the page that
appears, click one of these links:
I forgot my password. When you click this link, Google asks for the email address you
signed up with (or your Gmail user name, if you have one, in case you supplied the optional
secondary email address when you signed up for Gmail). Google shoots off an email to that
address with a link you can click to reset your password.
I forgot my username. If you're a Gmail user, Google asks for the secondary email
address you provided when creating your Gmail account; it then sends you a reminder email.
(Providing a secondary address is optional when creating an account, so if you didn't provide
one, you're out of luck.)

Maybe you have multiple email accounts and can't remember which one you used. Click the "I
forgot my password" link, and then try providing all your email addresses, one by one. Then check
each email account—one of them should have the email that lets you reset your password.
 

 
1.3. Managing Your Google Account
Sooner or later you're going to want to modify your Google Account settings—do things like add a back-up email
address, specify your time zone, start using a new program, and so on. This section tells you how to manage
your account so it meets your needs.
1.3.1. Edit Your Account Information
As you probably noticed when signing up, Google doesn't ask for a lot of personal info to create an account. But
what if you want your account to be a little more personalized? Say you prefer to be greeted by name (rather
than by email address) on your Google Account page. No problem. Just head over to "Personal information"
section of the Google Account page (Figure 1-4) and click its Edit link. The page shown in Figure 1-5 appears.
Figure 1-5. Use this form to change the personal info in your Google Account. All the stuff gathered
here is optional—you don't have to add your name, but your Google apps might feel more like
"yours" if you do.
1.3.1.1. Edit personal information

Things change with time: A wedding or divorce changes your name, or you move to a different Zip code, time
zone, or even country. Use this section to add or change any of the following (optional) settings:
First name
Last name
Nickname
Zip code
Country
Time zone (The drop-down menu here shows time zones based on your location. To change the list to
show all the world's time zones, turn on the "Display all timezones" checkbox.)
1.3.1.2. Associate email addresses with your account
You need just one email address to open your Google Account, but you can associate other addresses with it,
too. This can come in handy, for instance, when someone invites you to an event they've created on their
Google Calendar (Chapter 7)—whichever email address the other person uses for the invitation (maybe they've
got that old alumni address you occasionally use), you can respond.
When you type an address into the "Add an additional email address" text box, and then click Save, Google fires
off a verification email. As soon as you click the verification link, Google adds the address to your account.
NOTE
If you've got a separate Gmail account, you can't add that address to this Google Account. Why not?
That Gmail address already has a Google Account of its own, as the Note on [click here] explains.
If you change your mind and want to remove an additional email address from your Google account, just come
back to this page, find the account you want to ax, and then click its Remove link.
NOTE
The email address you provided when you opened your Google Account is the account's primary email
address. If you need to change your primary email address, check out the next section.

1.3.1.3. Change your email address
To change your primary email address, start on your Google Account page (www.google.com/accounts). In the
"Personal information" section, click the "Change email" link.
NOTE
If you originally opened your Google Account by signing up for Gmail (instead of, say, following the
instructions in "Signing Up" on [click here]), you don't see a "Change email" link, because you
automatically get a Google Account with your Gmail account. However, if you want to get rid of Gmail
(see [click here] for how to delete an application) without having to set up all your other apps from
square one, you can associate your Google Account with a different email address, and then delete
Gmail, leaving your other apps untouched.
Google takes you to the page shown in Figure 1-6, which is actually a little confusing. It shows your account's
primary email address in the box labeled "Your current email address". So far, so good. But this is also the box
where you type the email address you're changing to, even though nothing on the page indicates that. In the
box below it, type your Google Account password, and then click "Save email address".
Figure 1-6. On the "Edit email address" page, the address you currently use to sign into your Google
Account appears in the box. Replace that address with the new one, and then, in the Password box,
type your Google Account password (not the password for the email address you entered).

Google sends you a verification email to the address you entered. Zip over to your other email account and
check your inbox. Open the verification email, click the link in it, and you're done.
When Google sends the verification email to your new address, it also sends a notification to your old address, a
nice security feature that helps prevent someone from hijacking your account. If you are indeed changing your
primary email address, just ignore the notification. If, however, the notification arrives out of the blue, click the
link it contains. That takes you to the Google Accounts Help center, where you can fill out a form to contact
Google and get the problem straightened out.
After you've changed the primary email address, use the new address as your user name the next time you sign
in. Google doesn't recognize the old one anymore.
1.3.1.4. Change your password
Security experts recommend changing your password every once in a while to make sure no one else gets their
mitts on it. If you're the type who actually follows that (sound) advice, head to your Google Account page
(www.google.com/accounts) and click the "Change password" link. Google opens the "Change password" page,
shown in Figure 1-7.
Figure 1-7. As you type your new password, Google gauges its strength for you (circled) by testing it
against known password-stealing strategies (like entering every word in the dictionary, for
instance). The stronger the password, the more secure your Google Account.
On the "Change password" page, in the "Current password" box, type your current password (the one you're
getting rid of). Below it, in the "New password" box, type your shiny new password. To guard against typos,
type it again in the "Confirm new password" box. Click Save, and your new password takes effect. Don't forget
it! (But if you do, check out the box on [click here].)

For suggestions on what makes a good password, see the box on [click here].
1.3.1.5. For Gmail users: Change your security question
If you started using Gmail before you discovered you even had a Google Account, you don't see a "Change
email" link in the "Personal information" section. Gmail users can't change the primary email address for their
Google Accounts. Instead, you see a "Change security question" link; it's your way of protecting yourself when
you accidentally blog about, say, your first teacher's name. Clicking the link takes you to the page shown in
Figure 1-8.
Figure 1-8. When you sign up for Gmail, you have to provide a security question and answer. If you
want, you can change those here.
Google uses your security question to verify your identity if you forget your Gmail password. To change your
security question, type your password in the box that asks for it. Click the Security Question drop-down menu to
see a list of Google's suggested questions. (You can also write your own; select "Write your own question from
the list" and Google adds another text box where you can type your question.) Next, answer the question so
Google can check it against future attempts. If you want to add a secondary email address to your Google
Account (helpful if you forget your user name), you can also do that here. When you're done, click Save.
1.3.2. Add a Google App
If you've created your account by following the instructions on [click here] (as opposed to creating the account
by default when you signed up Gmail or Google Calendar), you may not have any programs in your account to
start with. No problem: Your account page gives you easy access to Google's offerings. They appear in the "Try
something new" section of your Google Account page (www.google.com/accounts).

Don't see the program you want? At the bottom-right of the page, click the More link to see the full list. You
have literally dozens to choose from, some of which you're probably already familiar with: Google Maps, Google
News, Google Earth, YouTube, Picasa (a photo-editing and sharing site), and many more.
To start using a program, click the name of the item you want. You may have to provide Google with a little
info—like a user name and security question/answer if you want to sign up for Gmail—but this takes only a
minute or two.
Frequently Asked Question: Your Google Account and Gmail
I signed up for a Google Account. Does that mean I have Gmail, too?
Not necessarily. If you opened a Gmail account before you had a Google Account, Google
automatically provides you with a Google Account—you can sign into it at
www.google.com/accounts or reach it through the Accounts tab of Gmail's Settings page (Settings
Accounts tab
"Google Account settings"). But the process doesn't work the other way
around: When you open a new Google Account, you don't automatically get a Gmail address—but
that's easy to fix.
Just sign into your Google Account page at http://www.google.com/accounts, and then, in the "Try
something new" section, click Gmail. (If you don't see it there, click More, and then, on the page
that opens, look for the Gmail link. Or just head straight to http://www.gmail.com.)
Gmail asks you to answer a couple of questions before it creates your new account—a name to go
in front of @gmail.com, a security question, and so on. When you open a new Gmail account in
this manner, your Gmail address becomes the account's primary email address, and the email
address you originally used to open the account becomes a secondary address.
1.3.3. Launch a Google App
When you start using Google apps, you'll probably go directly to the home page of the program you want to
use, like http://docs.google.com for Google Docs, www.gmail.com for Gmail, and so on. But if you're on your
Google Account page (www.google.com/accounts) and you want to leap from there to one of your apps, just
look in the "My services" section. Find the program you want to use, click its name, and off you go.
1.3.4. Delete a Google App
Once you have a Google Account, it's so easy to add programs that you're likely to try out a whole bunch. If you
find that, later on, one or two of them don't meet your needs or you don't use them all that much, it's easy to
prune things down with just a click or two. You can delete Gmail, Browser Sync, Web History, Orkut, and Google
Video from your Google Account.
First, go to your Google Account page and click the Edit link next to "My services"; the page shown in Figure 1-9
appears.
Figure 1-9. If you want to delete an application from your account, select from the "Delete a

Service" list. If you want to close your Google Account (and all your Google apps), click the bottom
link.
Each item in the "Delete a Service" section is a link. Find whatever you want to get rid of, and click its name.
The page you see next is tailored to the particular program you chose to delete, but whichever page you see, it
has two main purposes:
To explain any consequences of deleting the service (for example, if you delete Gmail, you'll no longer be
able to use it, duh, to send and receive email, and all your mail will be permanently deleted).
To get confirmation from you that, yes, you really want to delete the service.
1.3.5. Close Your Google Account
Google apps are so well designed, simple to use, and convenient to access that you probably won't ever want to
get rid of your Google Account. But if for some reason that time does come, vaporizing your account (and all
your apps with it) starts with a visit to the Google Account page (www.google.com/accounts).
In your "My services" section, click the Edit link, and then click "Close account and delete all services and info
associated with it". Google makes that link extra descriptive so you know exactly what'll happen if you choose to
proceed to the next page, Delete Google Account (Figure 1-10).
Figure 1-10. To make sure you know what you're losing when you close your Google Account, Google

lists everything associated with your account. If you want to preserve one or two items on the list,
click Cancel and see the previous section to learn how to delete individual programs without closing
your account.
Google wants to make really, really sure you don't accidentally delete a Google app. So on the Delete Google
Account page, it lists all the services associated with your account. You have to look at them all and turn on
each checkbox, one by one, before you can delete the account.
NOTE
Closing your account just means that you won't be able to use the Google goodies listed on the Delete
Google Account page—stuff that requires an account. But you can still read Google News, watch YouTube
videos, check out Google Maps, and so on.
Google also wants to make sure you understand that, if you owe Google money, canceling the account doesn't
cancel your debt. (Most Google apps are free. But you can, for example, buy extra storage space for Gmail.)

If you're still sure you want to delete your account, enter your password into the "Current password" box. Then
turn on the two checkboxes that confirm you want to delete the account and that, if you owe Google money,
you'll still pay. (If you don't owe Google any money—and chances are you don't—you still need to turn on that
checkbox to cancel the account.) Finally, click the Delete Google Account button. That's it—your Google Account
is history.
 

 
1.4. The Google Toolbar
Even though you don't need a Google Account to download the Google Toolbar, it's good to learn about it early
on because the Toolbar can supercharge your account and make managing it a breeze. The Google Toolbar,
shown in Figure 1-11, is a customizable toolbar that rides piggyback on a Web browser and puts your favorite
Google apps—and more—right at your fingertips.
There are several different versions of the Toolbar floating around. The version you have depends on the
browser you use, and when you installed the Toolbar. Versions covered here include Toolbar 4 and 5 for
Internet Explorer, and Toolbar 2 and 3 for Firefox.
NOTE
Google Toolbar has oodles of features, some of which aren't covered here. Because this book is about
Google apps, this section focuses on the parts of the Toolbar you can use to make working with Google
apps faster, easier, and more efficient; specifically, using the Toolbar with Gmail, Google Docs, Google
Calendar, and your Google Account. To find out everything you can do with the Toolbar, visit
http://www.google.com/support/toolbar.
Figure 1-11. Your Web browser tucks the Google Toolbar right below the address bar.
Before you get started, make sure you have the right equipment for using the Toolbar. Here's what you need:
To use Google Toolbar with Firefox:
Operating system: Windows 2000 or XP, Mac OS X version 10.2 or higher, or Linux.

Web browser: Firefox version 1.5 or higher.
To use Google Toolbar with Internet Explorer:
Operating system: Windows 2000, XP, or Vista.
Web browser: Internet Explorer version 6.0 or higher.
Sorry Mac fans: The Google Toolbar doesn't work with Safari. To get Firefox,
or to upgrade to the latest and greatest version, go to www.firefox.com, and
then click the big green Download Firefox–Free button. To install or upgrade
Internet Explorer, surf over to Microsoft's Download Center at
www.microsoft.com/downloads.
1.4.1. Downloading and Installing the Toolbar
Getting Google Toolbar onto your computer takes only a few minutes. From your Google Account page
(www.google.com/accounts), look for Google Toolbar under "Try something new". If you don't see it there, click
the More link, and then, on the page that opens, click Toolbar. Alternatively, point your Web browser to
http://toolbar.google.com.
If you're not on your Google Account page (or if you haven't opened a Google Account yet), go to the Google
home page (www.google.com), click the "more" link at the top of the page, and then click "even more". On the
page that opens, scroll down till you see the Toolbar link, and then click it.
NOTE
This section describes the steps for downloading the Toolbar to use with Firefox. If you're downloading
the Toolbar for Internet Explorer, the process is similar.
The Google Toolbar page (Figure 1-12) is where you download the Toolbar to your computer. Just follow these
steps:
Click the big, blue Download Google Toolbar button—you can't miss it.
Google shows you the Toolbar privacy policy. Read the box on [click here] for the highlights, so you know
what you're agreeing to.
1.

Figure 1-12. Google's Toolbar page gives you an idea of what you can do with the
Toolbar. Click the "View all features" link (circled) to find out some of the cool things
the Toolbar can do: Send Web pages to your friends, show how Google ranks the page
you're viewing, block pop-ups, and more. If you're ready to take the plunge, click
Download Google Toolbar.
If you're fine with the terms, click "Agree and Install".
Your computer may open a window telling you that a Web site is trying to download software to your
computer, and asking for your okay.
2.
Click Install.
Your computer downloads the files you need to install the Toolbar.
3.
After the download is complete, quit your Web browser, and then launch it again.
When your browser reopens, you see the welcome message shown in Figure 1-13.
Figure 1-13. After you've successfully downloaded and installed the Toolbar, you see
this box the first time you restart your Web browser. Take the time to read it, because it
explains how Google may use the info it collects as you surf the Web with your new
Toolbar.
4.

If your browser doesn't work quite right after you reopen it, restart your computer,
and then fire up your Web browser again.
You have some decisions to make before you start using the Toolbar. In the welcome message window,
you can adjust these settings:
Select your search site. Choose the country you reside in. This tells Google which of its dozens of
international search sites you want to use.
Use Google as my default search engine. If you want Google to be your default search engine,
leave this checkbox turned on. If you prefer another search engine, turn it off.
Allow downloads from Google. Leaving this checkbox turned on means that Google will
periodically (and automatically) update your new Toolbar. If you want the latest and greatest
improvements to the Toolbar without having to lift a finger, leave it on. If you'd prefer not to have
Google mess around with your Toolbar without your knowledge, turn it off.
Enable/Disable PageRank and Enhanced Safe Browsing. The PageRank button gauges a Web
page's popularity, based on things like how many other pages link to it. When you enable PageRank,
the Toolbar sends the Web addresses of pages you visit back to Google, so that Google can rank
them for you. Similarly, Enhanced Safe Browsing warns you about iffy Web pages—again, by sending
Web addresses to Google so it can check them out. (Google may log suspicious Web addresses.)
Some people are uncomfortable sending this information to Google; if you're one of them, turn on
the "Disable PageRank and Enhanced Safe Browsing" radio button. If you want to use these services
5.

with the Toolbar, turn on the Enable radio button.
Usage statistics. If you turn on this checkbox, then you automatically share certain info with
Google: whether the Toolbar installed successfully, how well the Toolbar works as you use it, and
how often you use the buttons on the Toolbar. Google doesn't collect your name, your email
address, or the addresses of Web pages you look at. Again, though, some folks like to maximize
their privacy. If you don't feel like sharing information about how you use the Toolbar, leave this
checkbox turned off.
When you've made your choices, click Finish.
You can start using the Toolbar right away. Read on to learn how you can customize it to include the buttons
you use most.
1.4.2. Customize the Toolbar
Now that you've installed Google Toolbar, you can use it to make your Web browsing speedier. This section
gives you an overview of what's on the Toolbar and how you can tweak it to work harder for you.
To learn all the ins and outs of what the Toolbar can do, visit Google's Toolbar Help
Center at http://www.google.com/support/toolbar. Once there, click the tab for the
browser you use: Internet Explorer or Firefox.
1.4.2.1. What's on the Toolbar
The Google Toolbar arrives in your browser with a standard set of buttons (Figure 1-14). These might vary a bit,
depending on your Web browser and the selections you made in the welcome message window (Figure 1-13).
Figure 1-14. The standard buttons on the Google Toolbar for Firefox. If you've installed the Toolbar
for Internet Explorer, it looks slightly different.

NOTE
The Google Toolbars for Firefox and Internet Explorer are slightly different, with different sets of
standard buttons. Figure 1-11 shows Toolbar 5 installed in Internet Explorer 6, so you can compare it
with the Firefox version shown in Figure 1-14. Some of the differences: the Google Toolbar for IE has a
pop-up blocker/unblocker, a spell checker, and a button that shows CNN news headlines among the
standard buttons it displays.
Here's a brief rundown of the standard buttons for Firefox and what they do:
Enhanced Search box. Why "enhanced"? Two reasons: As you type in a search term, Google guesses
what you might be looking for and offers suggestions (it also remembers what you've typed, in case you
want to find that term again). And when you click the Search button's down arrow, you have your choice
of where to search. Select a search type, and the icon on the Search button changes to show which of
these you're using:
Google Search
Search within a particular country
Search within the current Web site only
I'm feeling lucky (takes you straight to Google's top result for your term)
Search Google Images

Search Google Groups
Search Google News
Search Froogle (now called Google Product Search—less witty, perhaps, but certainly more
descriptive) to compare prices on items you want to buy.
Search Google Maps
Search your Google Bookmarks
Search the Google Button Gallery. (Find new buttons to add to your Toolbar, in categories such as
News, Tools, and Fun & Games. For example, you can add a button that shows you the current top
stories on CNN and takes you to CNN.com with one click.)
Search your Gmail account
Resize Search box. Click this line and hold down your mouse button, and then drag it to the left or right
to make the Search box smaller or larger.
Making the Search box a little smaller lets the Toolbar display more buttons.
Google News. Click this button, and your browser whisks you straight to Google News, where you can
read current headlines and search for news articles.
Gmail. Get one-click access to your Gmail inbox, as well as notification of new messages ([click here] tells
you all about using this button).
Free online dictionary. Need to look up a word? Highlight the word, and then click the button that looks
like a blue book. You whiz right over to dictionary.reference.com to find out what it means.
Add buttons. As [click here] explains, you can customize your Toolbar by adding and removing buttons.
Click this button to see a list of Google-suggested buttons, such as Google Blog Search and a Dictionary
button, to make your surfing even more efficient.
Bookmark this page. Click the star to add the current Web page to your Google Bookmarks (a list of
shortcuts to favorite Web sites). Google Bookmarks stores your bookmarks in your Google Account, not in
your browser, so you can access them from anywhere you have an Internet connection. Sign into your
Google Account. If you have Web History ([click here]) turned on, then Google stores your bookmarks
there. You can also add a Bookmarks gadget to your iGoogle page (Chapter 8).

The Bookmark button also lets you import your existing Firefox bookmarks or IE
favorites all with one click, so you can keep track of them in your Google Account,
not just in your Web browser.
Find/manage Google Bookmarks. Use this button to add or remove a bookmark, organize existing
bookmarks, or import bookmarks from your Web browser.
NOTE
You need to be signed in to your Google Account to use Google Bookmarks. (You can sign in right
from the Toolbar.)
AutoLink. This button recognizes and links to certain kinds of information, such as street addresses,
package tracking numbers, and publishers' ISBN numbers (for books). For example, if you're looking at a
restaurant's Web page, AutoLink detects its address and creates a link to a map page, showing you
exactly where the restaurant is.
AutoFill. This button can save you some typing when you fill out forms on the Web. If you click this
button, up pops a form where you fill in personal info like your name, address, and phone number. Then,
when you visit a Web page that has a form asking for this information, one click of this button fills it in for
you.
For step-by-step instructions on using AutoFill, visit the Google Toolbar Help
Center: www.google.com/support/toolbar.
Send to. When you click this button, Google sends the page—or the part of the page you've selected by
dragging your cursor—to one of these three places (you choose):
Gmail. Use Gmail to send the page or selection to yourself or someone else.
Blogger. If you have a Blogger account, this button sends the page or selection to that account,
using it as the start of a new blog entry.
SMS. This option sends the page or selection as a text message to the cellphone number you
specify.
Highlighting. When you use the Toolbar to do a search, click this button, and Google highlights your
search term wherever it appears on the page. Click the button again to turn highlighting off.

More arrow. If you have a lot of buttons on your Toolbar, some may be hidden (you can fit only so many
buttons across the width of a computer screen). Click this arrow to see any buttons not currently on
display.
Settings. Click this button to sign into or out of your Google Account, add or remove buttons (see the
next section), change the Toolbar's layout, report a suspicious Web site, or get help using the Toolbar.
1.4.2.2. Add a button
Google's Button Gallery contains dozens of buttons you can use to customize your Toolbar. To add a new
button, click Add Buttons (shown in Figure 1-14) or the down arrow next to it. Clicking the down arrow presents
a short list of Google-related buttons you can add (Google Blog Search or Stock Search, for instance). Clicking
the button itself takes you to the Google Toolbar Button Gallery, shown in Figure 1-15. In the Button Gallery,
you can browse within categories or search for a specific word or phrase. When you find a button you want to
add, simply click "Add to Toolbar"—it's that easy.
Figure 1-15. The Button Gallery offers a wealth of specialized toolbar buttons for every interest. To
browse within a category, choose one from the left-hand menu. Or use the Search box (circled) to
find buttons related to a particular word or phrase (like career or travel). The top five most-added
buttons appear in the box on the right. When you find a button you want to add to your Toolbar, click
its "Add to Toolbar" button (also circled).

When you select a button from the Button Gallery to add to your Toolbar, Google flags
any potential privacy concerns you should be aware of. For example, a button might
send information about your search to Google. If a button's a little too nosy for your
liking, don't add it.
1.4.2.3. Move a button
You can move buttons around on the Toolbar, if you like. Go to the Buttons tab of the Toolbar Options box
(Settings
Options
Buttons), shown in Figure 1-16. In the "Custom buttons" section, click to select the
button you want to move, and then click the Move Up or Move Down buttons to rearrange your Toolbar. (If the
Move Up or Move Down button stays grayed-out, it means you can't move the button you've chosen in that
direction.) When you've moved the buttons to where you want them, click OK.
Figure 1-16. The top part of the Google Toolbar Options box shows a set of Google buttons you can
add to (or remove from) your Toolbar. The bottom part shows custom buttons. If a checkbox is
turned on, the button's on your Toolbar; turn on checkboxes for any buttons you want to add. To
move a button, click it in the "Custom Buttons" window, and then use the lower-right Move Up/Move
Down buttons (circled). If you decide you want your buttons the way they were when you
downloaded the Toolbar, click Restore Defaults (also circled).

NOTE
If you're using Toolbar 5 and Internet Explorer, instead of Settings
Options, use the Toolbar Options
button (which looks like a little wrench) to open the Toolbar Options box.
1.4.2.4. Remove a button
As you adorn your Toolbar with custom buttons, you may find there are some buttons you don't use a whole lot.
You can most quickly remove a button from your Google Toolbar by right-clicking (control-clicking on a Mac) the
Toolbar, and then selecting Customize to open the Customize Toolbar dialog box.
What you do next depends on whether you use Firefox or Internet Explorer. In Firefox, drag buttons off the
Toolbar and into the Customize Toolbar dialog box (you may have to move the box so you can see your whole
Toolbar). In Internet Explorer, select a button in the dialog box, and then click Remove to take it off the
Toolbar.
Alternatively, you can remove a button from the Toolbar via the Toolbar's own settings. To get rid of a button
that way, follow these steps:
On the far right of the Toolbar, click Settings
Options. (If you use Toolbar 5 for Internet Explorer, click
the Toolbar Options button.)
Google opens the Google Toolbar Options box.
1.
Click the Buttons tab.
The Buttons tab (Figure 1-16) shows all the buttons you currently have on your Toolbar. If a button's
checkbox is turned on, it's on the Toolbar.
2.
Turn off the checkbox next to any button you want to get rid of (you can always come back to this box
and turn it on again later). Click OK.
The button disappears from your Toolbar.
3.
1.4.2.5. Delete a button
When you follow the steps for removing a button, the Google Toolbar doesn't display the button any more, but
the button is still hanging around so you can turn it back on. To delete a custom button from the Toolbar
entirely, head to the Buttons tab of the Toolbar Options box (Settings
Options
Button tab). Next, select
the button you want to delete by clicking its name. Then click the right-hand Remove button, and the button is
gone, gone, gone.

If you have a change of heart and want the button back, simply follow the steps to add a button ([click here]).
1.4.3. Using the Google Toolbar with Google Apps
As you browse the Button Gallery, you probably notice a number of buttons related to Google apps. Added to
your Toolbar, these buttons let you navigate to any Google app with just a click—and do a whole lot more. This
section describes some ways to use the Toolbar with Google apps.
1.4.3.1. Google Accounts
Wherever you are on the Web, you can sign into your Google Account through the Toolbar. Click the far-right
Settings button
Sign In, and enter your email address (or Gmail user name) and password. If you're signed
in, then the Settings button lets you sign out (Settings
Sign Out).
1.4.3.2. Google Docs
If you use the Firefox version of Google Toolbar, you can use the Docs feature to open files in Google Docs
(Chapter 2 and Chapter 3). With this feature turned on, if you're on a Web page and you click a link to open a
file, then it opens in Google Docs. Dragging a file icon—like a Word document's piece of paper icon—into a
browser window also opens that file in Google Docs. (If you use Windows, double-clicking the icon in Windows
Explorer does the same thing.)
NOTE
The Docs feature doesn't add a button to your Toolbar. Instead, it works quietly behind the scenes, so
you can easily open files in Google Docs.
You turn on the Docs feature from the Features tab of the Toolbar Options box (Settings
Options
Features, or Toolbar Options
Features if you use Toolbar 5 for Internet Explorer), shown in Figure 1-17.
Figure 1-17. Turn on the Docs & Spreadsheets checkbox (circled) to make documents open in Google
Docs. To fine-tune this feature, click the File Settings button.

To start using the Docs feature, turn on the Docs & Spreadsheets checkbox. If you want to specify which files
open in Google Docs, click the File Settings button to open the Files Settings box, shown in Figure 1-18. Google
Docs can open files with any of these extensions: .doc, .xls, .sxw, .odt, .ods, .rtf, and .csv. (These formats are
common word processing and spreadsheet formats.) Turn off the checkboxes next to any file types you don't
want to open in Google Docs, and specify how you want to open them. You can:
Drag a file's icon into your browser.
Click a link to a file on a Web page.
Double-click a file icon. (This works only in Windows.)

Figure 1-18. The File Settings box lets you control which kinds of files Google Docs opens
automatically, and what steps you need to take to open those files.
When you've got things how you want them, click OK, and then, in the Toolbar Options box, click OK again.
1.4.3.3. Gmail
If you use Gmail, the Toolbar can keep you up to speed with what's in your inbox as you surf the Web. Here's
what the Toolbar's Gmail button lets you do:
Get notified of new Gmail messages. The Gmail button gives you a peek into your Gmail inbox without
having to leave the Web page you're on. When you're surfing the Web and you get a new email, the Gmail
button lets you know by changing its icon from a closed envelope to an open one. Click the button's down
arrow to see a list of the unread messages in your inbox, as shown in Figure 1-19. Select a message to
open it in a new window. From there, you can reply to the message or go to your Gmail inbox.
Figure 1-19. The Gmail button gives you one-click access to your Gmail account. Click the Gmail

icon to go to Gmail, or click the button's down arrow to see the subject lines of any unread
messages in your inbox. If you want to read a message on the list, click it, and Google opens it
in a new window.
Send emails from Gmail. Say you're looking at a Web page, and you click an "Email us" link—but your
browser opens an email program that's not Gmail to send the message. You can set your Gmail Toolbar so
that mailto links automatically open Gmail. In Firefox, head to the Toolbar Options box's More tab
(Settings
Options
More), shown in Figure 1-20. In the Page Tools section, turn on the "Send with
Gmail" checkbox, and then click OK to make it official. (If you're using Toolbar 5 for Internet Explorer,
click the wrench icon to open the Options window. From there, click the Tools tab, turn on the "Send to"
checkbox, and then click Save.) Now, when you click a mailto link, a Gmail window opens so you can
compose your message.

Gmail" checkbox (circled).

1.4.3.4. Google Calendar
If you use Google Calendar (Chapter 7) to keep your crazy schedule running smoothly, you can work with
Calendar straight from the Google Toolbar. Go to the Button Gallery ([click here]), search for Google Calendar
to find the button—Figure 1-21 shows what it looks like—and then add it to the Toolbar (see [click here]). After
you've got the button on your Toolbar, click it to go straight to Google Calendar. (If you're not already signed in
to your Google Account, you can sign in on the way.)
Figure 1-21. Click the Google Calendar button's drop-down arrow to see upcoming events (up to 10)
scheduled in the Calendar. Click an event to edit it in Google Calendar.

You can do a few other nifty things with the Google Calendar button on your Toolbar:
See upcoming events. Click the button's drop-down arrow to see a list of the next 10 events on your
calendar (see Figure 1-21). Click an event to see or edit its details.
Add an event to your calendar. Type the details of an event (date, time, occasion, and so on) into the
Toolbar's Search box, and then click the Google Calendar button. You're whisked off to the form for
creating a new Calendar event ([click here]), with the info you typed already filled in.
Use a Web site to create a new event on your calendar. When you add the Calendar button to your
Toolbar, you can get a head start in creating events for your Calendar. Say you're looking at the Web site
of a conference you plan to attend. You can copy info straight from the site, and use it to create an event
in your calendar. Select the text you want to use, and then right-click (if you're on a Mac with a one-
button mouse, control-click). From the shortcut menu (shown in Figure 1-22), choose "Send to"
Google
Calendar. Your browser takes you right to Google Calendar's form for creating a new event ([click here]),
with the text you selected already filled in. Edit the info (if necessary), and then click Save Changes to put
the event on your calendar.
Figure 1-22. Save yourself some typing (and make sure you get the details right) by sending info
from a Web page straight to Google Calendar.

1.4.4. Removing the Google Toolbar
Some people have so many toolbars cluttering up their browsers that there's hardly any room left for Web
pages. If you find the Google Toolbar useful but don't want it at the top of your screen all the time, you have a
couple of options: You can hide the Toolbar or edit it to make it more compact. Or, if you've given the Toolbar a
test drive and you decide it's not for you, you can easily uninstall it.
1.4.4.1. Hide the Toolbar
You can hide the Toolbar so it doesn't show up in your Web browser, and then pull it up whenever you need it.
To hide a toolbar in Firefox or Internet Explorer 6 or earlier, select View
Toolbars to see a list of toolbars in
your browser. If there's a checkmark next to Google Toolbar, the Toolbar is visible. Select Google Toolbar to
remove the checkmark and hide the Toolbar. When you want to show the Toolbar again, just repeat the process
to toggle the Toolbar back on: View
Toolbars
Google Toolbar.
NOTE
If you use Internet Explorer 7, there's no menu bar from which to select View. Instead, use the right-
hand Tools button (Tools
Toolbars
Google Toolbar) to hide or show the Toolbar.
1.4.4.2. Edit the Toolbar's layout
The Toolbar Options box lets you tweak the layout of your Toolbar to save space. On the Toolbar, click Settings
Options
Layouts tab to open the dialog box shown in Figure 1-23. (If you're using Toolbar 5 for Internet
Explorer 7, click the Toolbar Options button—the one that looks like a wrench—and then Layouts.)

Figure 1-23. The Layouts tab is where you decide how much of the Google Toolbar to show or hide.
In the Layouts tab, you can make the Toolbar more compact by turning on "Replace [Firefox/Internet Explorer]
search box and hide Toolbar" (the exact wording depends on you browser). This option gives you the power of
Google-enhanced searching without all those other buttons crowding your screen. When you need one of those
buttons, just click the drop-down arrow next to the G beside the Google search box. In the menu that pops up,
click Show Google Toolbar.
If you decide you want to restore the full Toolbar, go back to the Layouts tab and turn on the "Classic Toolbar
layout" radio button.
1.4.4.3. Uninstall the Toolbar
If you want to remove the Toolbar from your computer, you can take one of several routes:
Uninstall using the Toolbar itself. This method should work no matter what browser or operating
system you use. Go to Settings
Help
Uninstall. (If you're using Toolbar 5 for Internet Explorer, click
the arrow on the Toolbar Options button, and then Uninstall.) A new window opens, warning you that
you're about to remove the Toolbar from your computer for good. The window has a text box where you
can tell the folks at Google why you decided not to stick with the Toolbar (it's optional). Click "Uninstall
the Google Toolbar", and it's gone.
Uninstall using Firefox. If you use Firefox as your browser, you can use Firefox's uninstall procedure to
get rid of the Toolbar. Open a Firefox browser window, and then click Tools
"Add ons" (for Firefox 2) or
Extensions (for earlier versions of Firefox). A window opens, showing programs you've added to Firefox.

Select "Google Toolbar for Firefox," and then click the Uninstall button. Close Firefox (if you have multiple
windows open, then make sure you close them all); the next time you fire it up, the Google Toolbar will be
gone.
Uninstall using the Windows Control Panel. To uninstall Google Toolbar's Internet Explorer version
using the Control Panel, select Start
Settings
Control Panel. In the Control Panel window, double-
click "Add or Remove Programs". Windows opens the "Add or Remove Programs" window and fills it with a
list of programs you have installed on your computer. Find and select "Google Toolbar for IE", and then
click the Remove button.
Up to Speed: The Legal Lowdown
Whenever you download software or sign up for a service, you're responsible for understanding
the terms and policies you're agreeing to. That might sound like a lecture from your dad, but it's
true. When you create your Google Account, you may be excited to get started using everything it
offers, but it's worth taking a few minutes to understand what you're agreeing to.
You can read Google's Terms of Service (ToS) and Privacy Policy by clicking the appropriate link at
the bottom of your Google Account page. This box describes some of the highlights—to get the full
scoop, go to www.google.com/accounts/tos to read Google's Terms of Service, or go to
www.google.com/privacypolicy.html for its privacy policy.
Google's Terms of Service emphasize the following points (remember—you agree to all of them
when you open your account):
Opening a Google Account and using the services Google provides is a legal agreement
between you and Google, a contract in which you agree to abide by the terms Google
specifies. Bad online behavior (basically, anything that violates the ToS) will get you kicked
off Google.
You're responsible not only for your behavior when you use your Google Account (and any
associated services) but also for any content you upload. Google takes no responsibility for
your content, so if you upload iffy or illegal content, like plagiarized text or child
pornography, it's your problem, not Google's.
Google reserves the right to change or even discontinue any service it offers. In addition, it
makes no promises about the availability or reliability of its services. (Generally, Google's
availability and reliability are both outstanding, but if something goes wrong and you can't
access your Google Account, you can't sue.)
You agree not to copy, sell, or redistribute any Google service—unless you somehow manage
to get Google's permission to do so. Also, if you gain access to any confidential Google info,
you agree not to divulge it.
You can end your legal agreement with Google at any time by closing your Google Account
(and all its related services).

Google's privacy policy centers on these issues:
Google collects information from you in three ways:
Personal info you provide when you sign up for a Google account or service.
Information about Web pages you visit, which it does using cookies. A cookie is a small
file that holds a string of characters and is created on your computer when you visit a
Web site. When you return to that Web site again, the cookie lets the site recognize
your browser. Cookies often store user preferences and other info about you.
Information that Google gathers automatically when you visit Google or one of its
services' sites. This includes the Web address you visit, your IP address (your
computer's address on the Internet), the type of browser you're using, and the date
and time.
Google uses the information it collects:
To provide you with customized content.
For its own analysis and research, to improve the services it offers.
To share with third parties. If Google shares your info with third parties, it generally
groups lots of people's info together and doesn't identify you personally. Google
sometimes uses third parties to process personal information, but does so only if the
third party complies with Google's privacy policy.
In very rare circumstances (like if you've broken a law or are threatening Google's
security), Google may turn over your personal info to a third party, such as police
investigating a crime.
You can decide not to divulge personal information, but that might mean you can't use a
particular service.
You can disable cookies in your Web browser, but if you do, some Google pages or services
may not work properly.
Google is very up front about privacy issues. For services where privacy is a concern, such as Web
History ([click here]) or the Google Toolbar ([click here]), Google puts a link to a specialized
Privacy page right from that service's Help page. So if you have any questions about, say, Google
Calendar, you can get specific answers.

 

 
Chapter 2. Word Processing with Google Docs
Ask people who work with Google Docs what they love about it (besides the price), and two words will crop up
pretty fast: "accessibility" and "collaboration."
In Google Docs—a Microsoft Office–like collection of word processing, spreadsheet, and slideshow presentation
tools—your documents are stored on Google's computers, so you can access them from anywhere with an
Internet connection. No more smacking your forehead because the report or spreadsheet you meant to bring
home is sitting on your office computer's hard drive, or worrying about where you might've lost that keychain-
sized flash drive that holds all your important files. No matter where you are, as long as you can get online, you
can edit, format, save, and otherwise work on all the files in your Google Docs account. You can even edit word
processed documents offline, and upload them automatically the next time you connect to the Internet.
But what makes Google Docs truly revolutionary is the way it lets you collaborate with others on a single
document in real time. No more sitting around twiddling your thumbs, waiting for your turn as a file gets passed
from person to person for editing and revisions. With Google Docs, up to 10 people can edit the same document
simultaneously, redefining the whole concept of working together.
NOTE
Because there's just so darn much you can do with Google Docs, this book devotes three chapters to it.
This chapter explains how to get your Google Docs account up and running, and then discusses word
processing. Chapter 3 covers spreadsheets, and Chapter 4 looks at presentations, a relatively new
addition to the Google Docs arsenal.
2.1. Before You Start: Browser Requirements
Google Docs works on Windows, Macintosh, and Linux computers. To make sure Google Docs works the way it's
supposed to on your computer, use one of these Web browsers:
Internet Explorer 6 or higher for Windows
Firefox 1.07 or higher (At this writing, Google Docs doesn't work with the beta version of Firefox 3 that's
available for testers.)
Mozilla 1.7.12 or higher
Netscape 7.2 or higher
If you use one of the following browsers, you'll probably run into trouble trying to use Google Docs (or it may

not work at all):
Safari
Internet Explorer on a Mac
Opera
Netscape 4
Not sure what version your Web browser is? Open the browser, and then click Help
About to find out. You can download the latest version of Firefox at
www.firefox.com; for Internet Explorer, go to www.microsoft.com/ie. Both
browsers are free.

browsers are free.
 

 
2.2. Welcome to Google Docs: A Quick Tour
If you're the proud owner of a Google Account, you can add Docs to your Google empire in a jiffy. Go to the
Google Docs sign-in page (www.docs.google.com), and then enter your Google Account user name and
password. Google adds Docs to your account, and takes you straight to the Google Docs workspace (Figure 2-
1). (If you don't yet have an account, flip back to Chapter 1 for full details on how to sign up.)
If you're signed into your Google Account page (www.google.com/accounts), then you
can add Docs from there. Look for Docs in the "Try something new" section. (If you
don't see it, click the More link, and then, on the page that opens, find Docs.) Click the
Docs link and you're off to the races.
Figure 2-1. The first time you sign into your Google Docs account, you see a page like this one. From
here, you can create a new file or upload an existing one from your computer. The circled buttons
get you started working with documents. When you create or upload a document, it appears in the
Docs list in the center of the page.
2.2.1. If You're Invited to Collaborate
You can get invited to view or collaborate on a document even if you haven't signed up for Google Docs. If you
get an email from Google telling you that someone's inviting you to share a document, then click the link in the
message.

If you have a Google Account and you're already signed in, then Google opens a new window displaying the
document you've been invited to share, and you can get to work on it right away.
If you're not signed into your Google Account, or if you don't yet have one, a new browser window opens,
showing a version of the shared document that you can read but not edit. At the top of the page, you see links
where you can sign into your account or create one:
Sign in. Click this link to sign into your Google Account. When you do, Google takes you to your Google
Account page. From here, you can click the Docs link to go to the Google Docs home page, where the
shared document is already in your Docs list.
Create an account. Click this link, and then follow the instructions for creating a Google Account on [click
here]. Google also asks for your first and last names so it can create your Docs account. When you've
verified your email address ([click here]), Google creates your account and takes you to your new Google
Account page. Click Docs, and the shared document is sitting there in your Docs list, waiting to greet you.
Click it to get to work.
NOTE
What you can do with an invitation depends on the kind of invite you receive. If your pal asks you
to collaborate on a Google doc, then you need a Google Account to jump in and start editing. If
you're invited just to view a Google doc, then you can see it even if you don't have a Google
Account ([click here] explains the difference between collaborating and viewing privileges).
2.2.2. The Google Docs Home Page
When you sign into Google Docs, you land on a page like the one back in Figure 2-1, where you can manage all
your Google Docs files. Once you've added a few files, the Docs home page lists them in the center of the page,
as you can see in Figure 2-2. Click a file's name to open it in a new window.
Figure 2-2. On the Google Docs home page, you create or upload new files, and manage existing
ones. The choice you make in the left-hand menu controls which files appear in the Docs list (all
your docs, just your spreadsheets, and so on), while the buttons across the top let you manage your
files by doing things like uploading, sharing, and deleting. Click a file's name to read or edit it in a
new window.

Your Docs list occupies the biggest part of the Google Docs home page. The list shows the most recent files at
the top—if you open a file, edit it a bit, and then save it, that file jumps to the top of the list. But you can order
the list in other ways, too, which might help you find a document even faster. Click the bar just above the Docs
list to sort files in any of the following ways:
Starred documents. You can assign stars to flag important files (details on [click here]). Click the little
star button to group starred and unstarred items separately. If the arrow is pointing down, then Google
lists all starred items at the top; unstarred items follow. If you want to reverse the order, then click the
star again.
Name. Click Name to display files in alphabetical order. If the Name arrow is pointing up, files are from
A–Z; if the arrow's pointing down, they're listed from Z–A.
Folders/Sharing. In Docs, folders are a lot like the folders you create in Windows or on a Mac to hold
your files. Because Docs files live on the Web, though, folders don't contain the actual documents; they
hold links to documents—click a link to open a document. This column shows two things: whether a folder
holds a document, and whether you're sharing the document with someone else. (If it's a shared file, the
column shows the name of the person you're sharing with; if it's yours alone, the column just says "me".)
Click Folders/Sharing to sort shared documents alphabetically by the document owners' names. (A
document owner is usually the person who created the document—but not always; see [click here].)

To see all the files in a particular folder, choose the folder from the left-hand menu
(you might have to click the + sign next to "All folders" to expand that section).
This changes the Docs list to show only files in that folder. Then you can sort those
files as you like.
Date. Click Date to display your documents by the date you (or someone you're sharing the file with) last
opened the file. If the arrow points down, the most recent files appear on top; an up arrow means the
oldest files are on top.
The menu bar above the Docs list is your command center for managing Google Docs files. You can do a lot
here:
Create a new document. Click the New button to whip up a new file. When you do, a drop-down file-
type list appears:
Document. See [click here] for more about creating documents.
Spreadsheet. Chapter 3 has the skinny on creating and working with spreadsheets.
Presentation. Chapter 4 covers slideshow-style presentations.
Folder. Google Docs lets you create folders to store and organize related documents. See [click
here] for tips on keeping your Docs organized.
Upload an existing document. Click the Upload button to transfer a document from your computer to
Google Docs ([click here] has step-by-step instructions).
Share a document. Turn on the checkbox next to a particular document's name, and then click Share to
invite somebody else to collaborate on it (or just view it without making changes); [click here] explains
the details of sharing documents.
Move a document. If you've created folders to organize your documents, you can put a document into a
folder. Select the file you want to move by turning on its checkbox, click the Move button, and then select
the folder where you want to put the file.
NOTE
Google Docs documents live on the Web; each one has its own unique address. So when you move
a document to a folder, what you're actually doing is creating a link to the document and storing
that link in the folder. Moving a document places a copy of a document's link in the folder you

choose; it doesn't remove the link to that document from your Docs list. If you don't want to see a
document in the Docs list, hide it (see [click here]).
Hide a document. You can hide documents so they don't appear in your Docs list. This can be helpful, for
example, when you have a document you're not actively working on but don't want to trash. Select the file
(or files) you want to hide, and then click the Hide button to make it (or them) disappear. For more on
hiding files (and finding them again), see [click here].
Delete a document. To move a document to the Trash folder, select it by turning on its checkbox, and
then click this button. See [click here] for the ins and outs of deleting Google Docs files.
Rename a document. To give a file a different name, turn on the checkbox next to the file you want to
rename, and then click the Rename button. The file's name turns into a text box where you can type a
new name.
More actions. When you turn on a file's checkbox, and then click "More actions", a list appears so you can
select what you want to do with the file. What's on the list depends on the kind of file you've chosen. For
word processing documents, here are your choices:
Manage sharing. Select this action to open a window that shows you current sharing info—who's
got permission to view and collaborate on this document, if anyone—and lets you set sharing
permissions, and invite others to share the document. See [click here] to read all about sharing your
documents.
Publish. You can also share a document by publishing it, either as a Web page or a blog entry;
[click here] explains how to publish documents you create in Docs.
Preview. Select this option to see how your document will look when it's published on the Web
([click here]).
Revisions. Each time you make a change to a file (or even just open it to take a look), Docs saves a
separate version of it. Choose this item to see a list of all the different versions, which you can view
or compare (as [click here] explains).
Save as [file type]. You've got a bunch of options when you want to save a document outside
Google Docs: HTML, Word (.doc), OpenOffice (.odt), PDF (viewable in Adobe Reader—[click here]),
RTF (rich text format, which preserves formatting you've added), and plain-vanilla Text (which
doesn't preserve formatting). When you select one of these options, Docs downloads the file to your
computer in the format you chose.
As you create or add new documents, the Docs list can get pretty long. To limit what the list displays, make a
selection from the left-hand menu:
All items. The usual setting, showing you all items in your Docs list. Click the + sign next to "All items" to

select a smaller grouping of your files:
Created by me. Shows all files that you've created in—or uploaded to—Google Docs.
Opened by me. Shows files you've viewed.
Starred. You can flag important files with a star. If you choose this option, then your main Docs list
displays only the starred files in your Google Docs account (whether you marked them that way or a
sharing partner did).
Hidden. If you've hidden a file ([click here]), view it by choosing this option.
Trash. When you delete a file, it lands in this folder. If you accidentally delete a file, then you can
find it here, and undelete it (see [click here]).
All folders. If you've created any folders ([click here]) to help organize your documents, they appear in
this section (you may have to click the + sign to see them).
Items by type. Google Docs handles documents, spreadsheets, and presentations. You can display only
those files belonging to a particular type by making a choice here (click the + sign to see the different file
types).
Shared with. If you're collaborating with people on a document ([click here]), you can find their names
here (you might need to click the + sign to see them). So, for example, if you're looking for a report
you're working on with Debbie, select Debbie's name. The Docs list displays only those documents that
you and Debbie share.
 

 
2.3. Customize Your Setup with Google Docs Settings
Once you open your Google Docs account, you can start creating or uploading documents. But it's worth taking
a minute to check out your account settings. For example, make sure Docs knows what time zone you're
in—especially important if you're collaborating with others spread across the country or around the world.
Start by clicking the upper-right Settings link (next to the email address associated with your account). This
gets you to the page shown in Figure 2-3.
Figure 2-3. Click the Settings link (circled) to jump to the Settings page's General tab, where you can
adjust things like the language Google uses to communicate with you (as well as the flavor of your
built-in dictionary), your time zone, and how your name appears to collaborators.
2.3.1. The General Tab
Here's a potpourri of miscellaneous settings you can adjust to make Google Docs even easier to work with:
Language. This setting doesn't translate your docs from, say, English to Turkish or Swedish or Chinese
(or vice versa). Instead, it controls how Google Docs talks to you. In other words, it tells Google Docs
which language to use for all the buttons, commands, and menu items it displays. You've got a couple
dozen languages to choose from.

Your current time zone. Choose a time zone from the list. If you're using Google Docs on the road, then
you can change time zones as you travel.
Right-to-left. If you write documents in Hebrew or Arabic, you know that people read and write those
languages from right to left, instead of the left-to-right flow of words that English and many other
languages use. Turning on this checkbox gets you a right-to-left button in your document composition
window, which you can click to make text start at the right side of the page, moving left as you type.
Display name. When you collaborate with others on a document, this setting determines how your name
appears to them.
Blog settings. Google Docs, it turns out, is also a great blog editing tool. But before you can edit your
blog posts, you need to let Google know about some of your blog's settings. Start by clicking the "edit
info..." link. This takes you to the Blog Site Settings window shown in Figure 2-4, which asks for your
blog's address and login info. Optionally, you can include the document's title as the name of your blog
post, if your blogging service can handle this feature (not all of them can—check with your blogging
service to find out).
Figure 2-4. Google Docs give you an easy way to compose and publish entries on your blog. If
you use a service like Blogger or Live Journal, choose it from the Provider drop-down list. If
you host your own blog or use a blog service not on the list, then turn on the "My own
server/custom" radio button, and the section expands so you can give Google the server's Web
address. To make it so you can post to your blog from Google Docs, give Google your login
information and the title of your blog. Click the Test button (circled) to see if Google can find
your blog with the settings you've provided.

To learn how to publish documents on your blog, flip ahead to [click here].
Old Writely Documents. Before Google Docs, there was Writely, an online word processing program that
hit the Web in 2005. In 2006, Google bought the company that created Writely, and combined its word
processor with Google's own online spreadsheet program. If you used Writely before Google bought it, you
may have some old Writely documents hanging around. In that case, click the "move old documents" link.
Google guides you through a two-step process that brings documents from your old Writely account over
to your new Google Docs account.
Google Account settings. Click the link here to open a new window showing your Google Account page
([click here]). You can change your password or manage your Google Account without leaving Google
Docs. How's that for convenient?
When your settings are all set, remember to click Save to make 'em stick.
2.3.2. The RSS Feeds Tab
Depending on whom you ask, RSS stands for rich site summary or really simple syndication—take your pick.
Whichever you prefer, RSS feeds let you subscribe to your favorite Web sites (news sites, blogs, and so on),
alerting you when new content appears, and providing links to the full story or blog post.
Most people use RSS to keep up with the mountains of online reading that interests them. But Google Docs has
its own special RSS twist, and a mighty helpful one if you spend lots of time collaborating with others: You can
subscribe to a feed that lets you know when a shared document has been edited. To flick this tool on, head to
the RSS Feeds tab (Settings
RSS Feeds), shown in Figure 2-5. After you've adjusted the settings here, you
can subscribe to feeds for individual Google documents (see [click here]).
Figure 2-5. Looking for a great change notification tool? Activate RSS feeds for your Google Docs by
clicking the "change setting" link (circled), and then confirm that you want to allow feeds. Then click
the Save button at the bottom of the page (also circled).

Google gives you a few different ways to work with RSS feeds:
Private documents in public feeds. This is where you turn on RSS feeds for your documents. When
your do so, others can see your documents' titles, as well as who made changes and when. It also means
you can subscribe to a Google Docs feed ([click here]) right on your Firefox Bookmarks toolbar or in your
Internet Explorer Feeds. To turn on RSS feeds, click the "change setting" link. A confirmation dialog box
pops up; click OK. (If you change your mind and want to turn off RSS feeds, come back to this page, click
"change settings" again, and then OK, to toggle feeds off.)
Active Documents. Click the "view feed" link in this section to see a list of recent changes to your docs.
Individual Documents. There's nothing for you to do in this section. It just explains how to see an
individual document's feed. (Read all about that on [click here].)
Tagged Documents. In summer 2007, Google Docs replaced tags (kinda like Gmail's labels [[click
here]]) with folders as a way to organize your documents. As of this writing, this section hadn't quite
caught up with the change.
If you change any settings on this page, remember to click the Save button when you're done.
 

 
2.4. Getting Your Docs into Google
At last, you're ready to create and save your first document. And if you've got existing documents sitting on
your computer that you're eager to move into Google Docs, this section shows you how to do that, too.
2.4.1. Creating a New Document
To create a brand-new document in Google Docs, start on the main Google Docs page shown back in Figure 2-1.
Above the Docs list, on the left side of the blue bar, click New
Document. A new window like the one in
Figure 2-6 opens. This is the Google Docs text editor, your home base for creating and editing word processing
documents. All you have to do is start typing.
Figure 2-6. The Google Docs text editor is where you work on your documents-in-progress. The
formatting buttons in the toolbar let you format your text as you write. Use the right-hand Share
button to invite others to collaborate on your document or publish it as a Web page or blog post.
See the section "Working with Text" ([click here]) to learn about formatting your whole
document and formatting smaller chunks of text as you type.
2.4.2. Importing an Existing Document
Chances are you've got some documents you'd like to transfer from your computer to Google Docs. You've got a
few different ways to do that, all explained in the following sections (including details on what types of
documents Google Docs can work with). Once they're there, you can work with those files from any computer
that's got an Internet connection.
2.4.2.1. Use the Google Docs home page
The Google Docs home page (shown back in Figure 2-2) has an Upload button above the Docs list, in the blue
bar. Click it to open the "Upload a File" page shown in Figure 2-7.
Figure 2-7. Use the top half of this page to upload a document by telling Google Docs where to find it

on your computer or the Web. If you'd rather email the document to your Google Docs account, use
the ginormous email address in the bottom half of the page. When you email a document, you can
send it either as text inside the email or as an attachment.
It takes just a few steps to upload your document:
Tell Docs where to find the file you want to upload.
If the file is on your computer, click Browse, locate the file, and then click Open. If the file lives
somewhere on the Internet, then enter its Web address. (The surest way to do this is to open a browser
window that contains the document, copy the URL, and then paste it into Docs.)
1.
Give your file a name (optional).
If you want to call the file something different from its current file name, then type the new name here.
You can always change a file's name from the Docs list. Select the file, click
Rename, and then type in the new name.
2.
Click Upload File.
3.

Google Docs uploads your file, and adds it to your Docs list.
There are some limitations to uploading documents into your Docs account:
The file must be 500 KB or smaller. If it's bigger than that, break it up into several smaller files and
upload those.
The file must be one of these types: text (.txt), rich text (.rtf), HTML (.html or .htm), Microsoft Word
(.doc), OpenOffice (.odt), or StarOffice (.sxw).
2.4.2.2. Email a document to Google Docs
Emailing files is a fast, simple way to get documents into your Docs account. When you click the Upload button
to get to the page shown in Figure 2-7, the bottom half of the page displays an email address that's just for
your account.
The email address Google assigns your Docs account is about a zillion characters long, which makes it hard for
others to guess—but also impossible for you to remember. The simplest thing to do is add the address to your
Gmail Contacts list ([click here]). That way, Gmail memorizes the address for you, making it easy to find and
preventing some serious brain strain. (Gmail can handle attachments up to 20 MB in size.)
Send an email to that address, and Docs creates a document from the email—whether your text is in the body
of the email or in an attached document. To upload several documents at once, attach them all to one email,
and Docs creates a separate file for each attachment. Docs can handle up to 10 attachments at a time.
NOTE
An attached document trumps text in the body of an email—if you send an email that contains both, then
Docs adds only the attachment to your Docs list.
When Docs receives an emailed file, you get a confirmation email in return, letting you know the document
made it. (Docs sends this confirmation to your registered email account—see [click here].) If you don't get a
confirmation, Docs didn't get the file, so try sending it again.
2.4.2.3. Upload in bulk
At this writing, Google Docs doesn't offer any way for you to move a big group of documents from your
computer to your Docs account. You can only upload as many documents as you can attach to a single email, as
explained above, which can be time-consuming—especially if you have hundreds of files you want to get into
Google Docs.
A couple of third-party developers have come up with ways to solve this problem:

Document List Uploader. This little program lets you transfer multiple files to Google Docs all at once.
Select your files, and then drag them into the Uploader. Uploader takes over from there, getting your files
into Google Docs. You can download the Windows-only Document List Uploader for free by going to
http://google-gdata.googlecode.com/files/DocListUploader-1.1.exe.
DocSyncer. This is a terrific idea that, at this writing, is still undergoing testing. Not only does DocSyncer
upload in bulk to your Google Docs account, it keeps Google Docs in sync with your word processor. So
when you're working on a document, for example, DocSyncer watches your documents for changes and
makes sure your word processor and your Google docs are in sync—automatically. It also lets you view all
previous versions of a document and backs up your work automatically. And you can double-click a file on
your Desktop and open it in Google Docs. To find out more, visit http://www.docsyncer.com.
2.4.3. Saving a Document
One of the great things about using Google Docs is that you may never again have to worry about saving a
document. Google saves your work automatically every couple of minutes, and stores each saved version in the
Revisions list ([click here]). And if you click the Docs Home link or sign out of Google Docs, then Docs saves
your work before it does anything else. Docs is fanatical about capturing and storing every change you make.
If you want, you can save even more often than Docs already does. You have four ways to save a document:
Click the upper-left Save button (the one with a picture of a floppy disk).
Also in the upper left, select File
Save.
Click the upper-right Save button.
If you're done with the document for now, in the upper right, click "Save & close".
Docs saves the file, and adds this version to its Revisions list ([click here]). You can also save a copy of your
document or download it to your computer, as explained next.
2.4.3.1. Saving a copy
You can save an exact copy of a presentation as a new file, which can be helpful if, for example, you want to use
a document's format or outline as a starting point for a new document. Or you might want to save your own,
private snapshot of a shared document.
To save a copy, open the document you want to copy, and then click File
"Save as new copy". If you're not
sharing this document with anyone, then Docs creates a copy of the document with the name "Copy of
document title". So if your document's name is Budget, for example, the new version is called "Copy of Budget".
Docs opens the copy in a new window, where you can save it or work on it.
When you click File
"Save as new copy" for a document that's shared, Docs pops up a dialog box asking

whether you want to copy the collaborators, too. Copying collaborators means that everyone who can see or
work with the current document has the same privileges for the new copy. If that's what you want, then click
OK. If you want the new copy to be just for you, click Cancel. When you click Cancel, Google copies the
document, but not the sharers.
2.4.3.2. Downloading a document
If you want to save a copy of a document on your computer, then you need to download it, where you can open
it in another program like Microsoft Word and save it to your hard drive or a portable storage device. You might
do this if you want to open the document in Word and use Word's formatting features (many of which aren't
offered in Google Docs—see [click here]) to get it looking just right before you print or email it.
To export a document from Google Docs, click File. From the list that appears, select "Download file as".
Another menu flies out; choose the kind of file you want to save as. For example, if you normally use
OpenOffice Writer as your word processor, then choose "Download file as"
OpenOffice. Figure 2-8 shows
your options.
Figure 2-8. When you want to download a document to your computer, use the File menu's
"Download file as" section to choose your format.

After you've selected the type of file you want to download, a window opens asking what you want to do with
the file. You can save it on your computer or open it with the appropriate program. Make your choice, and then
click OK. Your computer saves or opens the file. Now you can work on the file even when your computer isn't
connected to the Internet. If you make changes, don't forget to upload the new version back to Docs (see [click
here]).
 

 
2.5. Ready, Set, Write: Working with Documents
Once you've stocked Google Docs with some documents—whether by uploading or creating them from
scratch—you can get to work writing and editing. This section covers just about everything you might want to
do with your documents—from formatting to working with tables, to printing and deleting.
NOTE
When you're done working on a document and want to return to the Docs list, you'll probably click the
upper-right Docs Home link—and then wonder what happened to Google Docs. Clicking Docs Home saves
the document, and closes the text editor window. The Docs home page is still there, it's just in a
different window. This behavior can be disconcerting at first, especially if you tend to have a lot of
windows open at once.
2.5.1. Formatting a Document
Even the most ardent Google Docs lover will probably get kinda quiet if you ask about Docs' formatting
capabilities. Despite all the things Docs does so well—from access to storage to searching to collaboration—it
doesn't offer all the formatting bells and whistles that you get with, say, Microsoft Word. On the other hand, it's
free and it gets the job done, offering all the basics and a bit more. Despite some limitations, you can still
produce professional-looking documents with Google Docs. This section explains your formatting options.
If Docs doesn't offer formatting that you need, such as a particular font, export the
document ([click here]), and use a program like Word to apply the formatting. Make the
document as fancy as you like, and then print out or email the formatted version.
To apply formatting like line spacing or a font style to an entire document, follow these steps:
Create a new document or open one from the Docs list. Select Edit
"Document styles".
Docs opens the Document Styles box, shown in Figure 2-9.
Figure 2-9. To apply formatting to your whole document, use the Document Styles box.
The Preview window gives you a glimpse of what your changes will look like. If you're
writing in Hebrew or Arabic, turn on the Right-to-left checkbox. To apply your
formatting choices to new documents, turn on the "Make these the default settings for
all new documents" checkbox (circled).
1.

If you want the document to stick with the formatting and styles Docs normally uses, turn on the "Turn Off
All Styles" radio button.
If you'd rather make your own formatting choices, then turn on the "Use my font and line spacing settings,
below" radio button. Then you can select a font style and size, line spacing, and background color (if you
want one). In the right-hand box, Google previews how your formatting will look. If you want to apply
these settings to any documents you create from here on out, turn on the "Make these the default settings
for all new documents" checkbox.
2.
When everything looks good, click OK.
Docs applies your formatting to the current document.
3.
2.5.2. Working with Text
As you write, you'll probably want to add a little emphasis here, break out a list there. You do this using Docs'
formatting toolbar: a bunch of buttons on the gray bar directly above the space where you type. Here's what
each one does:
Save. The Save button looks like one of those old-fashioned floppy disks that went the way of the
cassette tape. Google automatically saves a version of your document every few minutes. If you want to
save more often than that, then click this button once in a while.
Print. This button saves the current document, and sends it to your printer. (For more on printing
documents, see [click here].)

Undo/Redo. The Undo button, which looks like a curved arrow pointing left, reverses whatever you just
did in the text editor. If you typed something, then the Undo button makes that text disappear. If you
italicized a word, then Undo takes the italics away. The Redo button, a curved arrow that points right,
restores whatever you just undid with Undo.
Don't worry if you can't remember which button is Undo and which is Redo. For a
quick reminder, hover your cursor over the button in question. After about a
second, a little label pops up telling you what the button does. (This trick works for
any of the buttons on this bar.)
Font style. Click this drop-down list to choose from about a dozen different fonts—from Serif (which looks
a lot like Times New Roman) and Sans Serif (which looks like Arial) to Verdana and Garamond.
Font size. Google Docs gives you a fairly narrow range of font sizes to choose from—from 8 points to 36
points.
Bold. This button bolds any text you've selected or are typing.
Italic. Italicizes the selected text.
Underlining. This button—you guessed it!—underlines text.
Change font color. Click this button, and then choose from a few dozen different colors. (To change the
color of your document's background, use the Document Styles box [[click here]].)
Highlighting. To add highlighting, select the text you want to highlight, and then click this button and
choose a highlight color. (To remove highlighting, change the highlight color to white, or use the "Remove
formatting" button, described a few items down this list.)
Link. You can add a hyperlink to your document using the Insert button ([click here]), but this button
gives you a quicker, easier way. Select the text you want to turn into a hyperlink, click this button, and
then tell Google where to link to. (For more on inserting hyperlinks, see [click here].)
Numbered list. Creates a list that starts at 1 and adds a new number each time you make a new
paragraph.
Bulleted list. Adds bullets in front of the text you've selected (or are about to type).
Increase/Decrease indent. Clicking these buttons makes the selected text jump farther away from or
closer to the left margin, respectively.

Alignment. These three buttons tell Docs how to arrange your text on the page—left-justified (a straight
margin on the left), centered, or right-justified (a straight margin on the right). The tiny lines on these
buttons are meant to give you an idea of how your text will look formatted each way.
Remove formatting. If you don't like the way your text looks after you've formatted it, select the text
and then click this button, which looks like an italic letter T with an x at the bottom. This button can
remove lots of formatting at once: If you've gotten a little overemphatic by typing a sentence in bold,
italic, underlined, red, 36-point font, one click of this button scrubs all that formatting away.
Check Spelling. Click this button to have Docs give your document the once-over for spelling mistakes
and typos. Docs highlights all the iffy words it finds. Click a highlighted word to get spelling suggestions or
to add the word to the Docs dictionary so it doesn't get marked as misspelled. (To turn off the highlighting
after you've reviewed a spell check, click the Check Spelling button again.)
2.5.3. Working with Lists
Lists help you make an argument point by point or lay out the steps of a process. To create a list in Docs, you
just click the button for the kind of list you want: bulleted or numbered. Docs applies that formatting to any text
you selected or to what you type after you've clicked the button.
After you've created a list, you can change the style of its bullets or numbers. Just right-click the list (control-
click on a Mac), and a menu appears. Select "Change list", and pick the bullet or numbering style you want
(each kind of list gives you several options). For a numbered list, Change List also lets you pick a number other
than 1 to start with—a nice feature if you've interrupted a numbered list with a figure or tip.
If you're looking at a list and decide you need to rearrange the items—what you put as step 3 is really step 2,
for example—select the list item you want to move, and then right-click (control-click). From the pop-up menu,
select "Move list item up" or "Move list item down", and Docs does just that.
2.5.4. Inserting Pictures, Tables, Headers, and More
The Insert button (Figure 2-10), sitting in the blue bar above the formatting buttons, lets you spiff up your
documents by adding a slew of things that go beyond plain old text—images, hyperlinks, comments, tables, text
separators, special characters, page breaks for printing, headers and footers, and bookmarks. This section
teaches you all the neat stuff you can do with these tools.
Figure 2-10. Using the Insert menu's options, you can take your document beyond the basics by
adding images, links, tables, special characters, and more.

You can also find most of the Insert menu's options on the menu that appears when you
right-click (control-click) in a document.
2.5.4.1. Insert an image
If a picture is worth a thousand words, you can save yourself a lot of typing by adding some images to your
document. When you want to insert a picture, click to put the cursor where you want the image to be, and then
click Insert
Image. (You can also right-click anywhere in your document—control-click on a Mac—and, from
the menu that appears, choose Insert Image.) Docs opens the Insert Image box, shown in Figure 2-11.
Attention keyboard shortcut lovers: Google Docs comes loaded with these timesavers;
see [click here] for a list.
Figure 2-11. When you insert an image, you can tweak its settings before you put it in your
document. (Here you see the choices you get when you expand the "More image options" section by
clicking its + sign. Click the – sign to hide these options.)

In the Insert Image box, start by picking a picture. Tell Docs where to find the image, whether it's stored on
your computer or displayed on a Web page. After you've chosen your image, click Insert to put it in your
document, or, next to "More image options", click the + sign to play with the following settings:
Size. You can insert the image at its original size or, from this drop-down list, choose from thumbnail-size
(up to 160 pixels wide) to humungous (up to 1600 pixels wide).

Workaround Workshop: Putting a Chart in a Document
There's nothing like a few pie charts or bar graphs to liven up a report. Chapter 3 tells you all
about using spreadsheets in Google Docs, including how to create a chart from data in a
spreadsheet ([click here]). Once you've created your lovely chart, though, how can you show it off
in a document?
You can't import a chart directly into a Docs document from a Docs spreadsheet. But don't
despair—you can get your chart into your document by treating it as an image. Then, you simply
insert the chart into your document just as you would a photo, a logo, or any other image. This
takes a few steps, but the results are definitely worth the effort.
First, create your document ([click here]) and your chart—flip to [click here] and follow the steps
for creating a chart from spreadsheet data. (Keep a finger on this page to mark your place. You'll
be back in a minute or two.) When you've created a shiny new chart, follow these steps to insert it
into your document:
Click your chart to select it, and then click its upper-left Chart link. From the menu that
appears, select "Save image".
1.
A window appears, asking whether you want to open the image or save it to your computer.
You want to save it, so turn on the "Save to Disk" radio button, and then click OK.
Your computer downloads the image and saves it (with a catchy, Docs-assigned name like
image.png) to your computer's desktop. PNG stands for portable network graphics; it's a
popular file format used mostly on the Web.
2.
Open your document, click the spot where you want the chart to appear, and then click
Insert
Image.
The Insert Image box (Figure 2-11) opens.
3.
Click Browse, and then find your chart (look for the .png file extension). Click Open to get
the file into the Insert Image box, and then click Insert.
4.
Docs inserts the chart into your document. From there, you can resize it by dragging its handles
(the white squares). You can't edit the chart in your document—that's because it's a picture of
your chart, rather than the chart itself. If you need to make changes to it, go back to your
spreadsheet to edit it ([click here]), and then follow these steps again to get the revised chart into
your document.

You don't have to adjust the image's size in the Insert Image box. After you've inserted
the picture, you can resize it right in your document. It's easy—just click the image and
drag the little white squares that appear around its border (see Figure 2-12). Click the
Undo button if you don't like how your resizing looks.
Position. Your choices are left-aligned (lined up with the page's left margin), centered, or right-aligned
(lined up with the right margin).
Wrap text around image. Turn on this checkbox if you want the image to appear within a paragraph.
Clicking this image links to the original image file. If you add an image that lives on the Web by
giving Docs its URL, then viewers can right-click (control-click) the image to open it in a new window, if
you turn on this checkbox.
When you've chosen your settings, click Insert to place the image in your document, as shown in Figure 2-12.
(If you want to change your setting choices, right-click [control-click] on the image in your document, and then,
from the menu that pops up, choose "Change image".) Once an image is in a document, you can resize it. You
can also select the image, and then copy and paste it into another location or document.
Figure 2-12. Click the picture to bring up resizing handles (the little white squares). Hover your
cursor over a handle until it turns into a double-headed arrow (circled), and then drag the handle to
resize the image. If you don't like the new size, simply click the Undo button ([click here]).

2.5.4.2. Insert a link
Since the documents you create, edit, and store in Google Docs are actual Web pages, you can easily include
hyperlinks in them. When you're working on a document, select the text you want to link. Then, you have three
ways to insert the link:
In the middle of the toolbar, click the Link button.
Click Insert
Link. (It's next to a little picture of some links of chain—get it?)
Right-click (control-click) the selected text, and then, from the menu that appears, choose Insert Link.
Whichever method you use, the Insert Link box shown in Figure 2-13 opens. Here's what you can do in that
box:

Figure 2-13. In the top half of the Insert Link box, tell Docs what kind of link you want and where to
link to. In the bottom half, Docs automatically fills in the text you selected in your document. If you
didn't select any text, then type new text here. Docs adds it to your document. Next, if you want,
type a flyover message that explains what your link does. Finally, if you're linking to a URL, you can
tell Docs to make the link open in a new browser window (circled).
Link To. This section has two parts:
Tell Docs what kind of link to insert:
URL. Link to a Web page. (URL stands for "Uniform Resource Locator," which is just a fancy
term for a Web address.)
Document. Link to another document in Google Docs (you can't link to a document on your
computer).
Bookmark. Link to a place within your document. (See [click here] for more about
bookmarks.)
Email address. Create a "mail to" link so that when someone clicks the link, his email
program opens a new message with the To email address already filled in.
Give Docs the info it needs to create the kind of link you chose:
URL. Type the address of the Web page you want to link to. (You can most easily do this by
opening the page in another browser window, coping what's in the address bar, and then
pasting it in this box.)

Document/Bookmark. When you choose either of these options, the text box changes to a
drop-down list with any bookmarks in your document. Click the drop-down list, and then select
the bookmark you want to link to.
Email address. Type in the email address you want mail to go to when someone clicks the
link.
Link Display. This section also has two parts:
Text. This shows the text that will be linked. If you selected some text in your document before you
opened the Insert Link box, then that text appears here automatically. In Figure 2-13, for example,
the words Google Account are linked, and appear in your document as blue, underlined text. When a
reader clicks anywhere on that phrase, the Web page specified in the URL text box opens.
If you didn't select any text, type some here, and Docs inserts it (with its associated link) into your
document wherever the cursor is. If you leave this box blank, then Docs inserts the URL you typed in
the Link To section directly into your document. So, for example, instead of the linked words "Google
Account", the reader would see the link http://www.google.com/accounts in your document.
Flyover. Flyover text appears when a viewer hovers her cursor over a link. A flyover might be an
explanation of where the link goes or a nudge to click the link. For example, if your link is a
bookmark to, say, something called Table 4.7, the flyover might give that table's title. Or, if your
sales letter has links to various products, your flyover might say, "On sale!" or "Click now! Going
fast!" Flyovers are optional; if you want one, type it here, and then check carefully for typos—Docs
doesn't spell check flyovers.
Open link in new window. This checkbox appears only if you're linking to a Web page or another
document. It's a good idea to turn it on, because opening the link in a new window means that, after
clicking the link, your reader doesn't have to navigate back to your document to keep reading.
Once you've provided the necessary info and clicked Insert, Docs puts the link in your document. Back in the
text editor, you can see what the link looks like (and check to make sure it works); click the upper-right Share
button, and then select "View as web page (Preview)". Now you see how your formatted document will look
published on the Web ([click here]).
You can most easily remove a link by deleting the text that holds the link. You can also
delete a link by right-clicking (control-clicking) the linked text, choosing "Remove link"
from the menu that appears, and then, in the confirmation box, clicking OK.
2.5.4.3. Insert a comment
Put your cursor where you want the comment to appear, and then click the Insert
Comment. (You can also
right-click [control-click] where you want the comment, and then, from the menu that appears, choose Insert
Comment.) Docs inserts a comment at the point you chose, as shown in Figure 2-14. Start typing to have your
say.

Figure 2-14. When you click Insert
Comment, Docs inserts a highlighted comment (circled)
wherever the cursor was. Docs puts the insertion point in the comment, so you can just start typing.
Comments show the name of the commenter, and when the comment was made.
NOTE
Comments are really handy when you're collaborating on a document; the section "Sharing and
Collaborating on Documents" ([click here]) goes into more detail about them, including how to change a
comment's color or make it part of the document's text.
2.5.4.4. Insert a table
Position the cursor where you want the table, and then click Insert
Table. Alternatively, you can click Table
Insert Table, which brings up the box shown in Figure 2-15.
Figure 2-15. Here's where you tell Docs how to format the table you want to insert.

You've got to set up your table before you can insert it, and do this setup in the Insert Table box. You don't
have to get everything perfect here; you can edit your table later—adding a column here, deleting a row there,
removing a border, and so on. To create your table, give Docs the following info in the Insert Table box:
Number of rows.
Number of columns.
The table's width. Your choices here are:

Full width. The table will take up the entire width of a page.
Size to content. The table will be as wide as required to fit its cells' contents.
Width in pixels. This is a precise way to specify how wide you want the table to be.
Width as a percentage. If you type 50 here, the table will stretch halfway across the page; if you
enter 67, it will stretch across two-thirds of the page, and so on.
Columns of equal width. Turn on this checkbox if you want all your columns to be the same width, no
matter how much content a particular cell holds.
The table's height. This drop-down list gives you the same choices as in Width menu (above), except
they determine how tall or short your table is.
Padding. In a table, adding padding puts a little space between the content of a cell and the cell's border,
making the table easier to read. Raise or lower the number here to increase or decrease the amount of
space. You'll probably find that Docs' suggested 3-pixel padding works just fine in most cases.
Alignment. You can make the text within each cell centered or left- or right-aligned.
Spacing. Adding spacing sets the distance between cells.
Float. Floating a table lets you wrap text around it. Choose None, Left, or Right .
Border size. If you want your table to have a border, type a number to determine how thick it is. (If you
don't want a border, then leave this setting at 0).
Border color. Click this box to choose a color for your border.
Background color. Click this box to select a color for the table's cells.
When you've set up your table, click Insert. Docs puts the table into your document. Simply click a cell, and
then start typing. If you decide you want to tweak how your new table looks, turn to [click here] for tips on
formatting tables.
If you've just inserted a table and changed your mind, clicking Undo doesn't uninsert it.
If you want to take the table out of your document, then right-click (control-click) the
table. From the menu that appears, select "Delete table".

2.5.4.5. Insert a bookmark
A bookmark is a special kind of link that lets you link to a particular place within your document (as opposed to,
say, a Web page). Bookmarks are helpful when you want a one-click-away cross-reference or when you're
creating a table of contents or an index.
Using bookmarks in Docs takes two steps:
Create a bookmark.
To do this, select the text, image, or other element you want to bookmark; this could be a table, a
chapter title, a figure caption—whatever. Then, click Insert
Bookmark (or right-click [control-click] and
choose "Insert Bookmark" from the menu that appears) to open the Insert Bookmark box, shown in Figure
2-16. In the New Bookmark text box, type a name for your bookmark (so you can find it to link to later),
and then click OK.
Figure 2-16. Be sure to give your bookmark a descriptive name so you can easily find
it—especially important if you have lots of bookmarks in your document. If you want to
remove a bookmark, in the Other Bookmarks list, click its name, and then click the
Remove button (circled).
1.
Link to the bookmark.
After you've created a bookmark, next up is linking to it. Say you want to put in a cross-reference to an
upcoming section, so that readers can jump ahead to that section with one click. After bookmarking the
target section (as described in step 1), select the text you want to link to that bookmark, and then click
Insert
Link. In the Insert Link box (Figure 2-13), select Bookmark as the type of link you're creating,
2.

and then use the Bookmark drop-down list to find the bookmark you want to link to. Now, when folks click
on the linked text, they'll hop right to that bookmarked section.
When you create a new bookmark, you don't see any changes to the text. Instead of showing your bookmarks
in the text editor, Docs adds them to your Bookmarks list, which is where you look for them when you link to a
bookmark.
After you've created a few bookmarks, you can manage them by clicking Insert
Bookmark. When the Insert Bookmark box (Figure 2-16) opens, it lists existing
bookmarks, so you can create a new bookmark or remove an existing one (select a
bookmark from the list, and then click Remove).
2.5.4.6. Insert a separator
Docs offers two ways to separate your document into different sections:
Page break. This forces a new page to start after the break. Page breaks are helpful when you're working
on a document that's divided into chapters—you can insert page breaks to make sure each chapter starts
on a new page.
Horizontal line. This inserts a horizontal line in the document, which is a good way to make clear
distinctions between different sections.
Whichever kind of separator you want to insert, position your cursor where you want to put the separator. Then
click Insert
 "Page break (for printing)" to insert a page break, or Insert
 "Horizontal line" to insert a line.
Docs inserts the separator where you want it.
If you want to delete a page break or horizontal line, put your cursor just after the
separator, and then hit the Backspace key.
2.5.4.7. Insert a special character
Google Docs' set of special characters is small compared to other word processors, but it has a lot of the accents
and diacriticals that you can use to add a soupçon of international flair to your writing. To insert a special
character (like the ç in soupçon), put your cursor where you want the character to go. Click Insert
"Special
characters", and then, in the Insert Special Character box, click one of the offerings (shown in Figure 2-17).
Voilà!—Docs inserts the character into your document.
Figure 2-17. Here's where you choose a special character for Docs to insert. In addition to the ones
shown here, Docs also has a set of Asian characters. If you're geeky enough to know the Unicode
name for the character you want to insert, turn on the Advanced radio button, and then type in the
code.

2.5.4.8. Insert a header or footer
If you want specific text to appear at the top of each page, such as your name or the document's title, then click
Insert
Header. At the top of the first page of the document, Docs opens up a space; in that space, type
whatever you want for your header.
Footers work the exact same way, except the box appears at the end of the last page of the document. Click
Insert
Footer, and then get typing.
You can also right-click (control-click) to insert a header or footer. Then, from the menu
that appears, simply choose the one you want.
You can edit your header or footer whenever you like. Just click inside the header or footer (which is surrounded
by a dotted gray line), and then make your changes. To delete a header or footer, right-click (control-click) it,
and then select Delete Header or Delete Footer.
NOTE

When this book went to press, Google Docs was still having a little trouble getting headers and footers to
export correctly into Word. If you're exporting a Google doc as a Word doc ([click here]), then you don't
see a header or footer on each page of the Word doc, the way you expect headers and footers to work.
Instead, Word displays a header only on the first page and a footer only on the last page. Google is
working to fix this problem, but it's worth watching out for if you export into Word.
2.5.5. Working with Tables
On [click here] you learned how to insert a table into a document. But what do you do when it's time to modify
an existing table? Read on.
2.5.5.1. Add or delete a row or column
As you work with a table, you may find you need more room—or you've got some empty rows or columns you
don't need. To adjust the rows or columns in a table, click the table near the place that needs adjusting, and
then click Table in the blue bar above the formatting buttons. (Alternatively, you can right-click [control-click]
the table.) From the menu that appears, shown in Figure 2-18, choose one of these options:
Insert row above
Insert row below
Insert column on the left
Insert column on the right
Delete row
Delete column
Figure 2-18. This menu gives you all kinds of ways to work with your table—just take your pick.

Power Users' Clinic: Firefox Table Shortcuts
If you use Firefox as your Web browser, then you have an easy way to adjust a table's rows and
columns. After you've created a table, and you click one of its cells, you may notice the symbols
that appear on its vertical and horizontal borders: two arrows and a circle with an X inside (you
can see them in Figure 2-18). You can use these controls to make quick adjustments to the
number of rows and columns in your table:
Add a row above this one. On the horizontal border, click the upward-pointing arrow.
Add a row below this one. On the horizontal border, click the downward-pointing arrow.
Add a column to the left of this one. On the vertical border, click the left-pointing arrow.

Add a column to the right of this one. On the vertical border, click the right-pointing
arrow.
Delete this row. On the horizontal border, click the circled x.
Delete this column. On the vertical border, click the circled x.
If you make a mistake, just click the Undo button ([click here]), and Docs reverses your last
action.
2.5.5.2. Move a row
To move a row, right-click (control-click) the row you want to move, or click that row, and then click Table.
From the menu that appears (Figure 2-18), select "Move row up" or "Move row down", depending on where you
want to put it.
If you use Firefox, you may find that right-clicking a table displays two menus: one for
Docs and one for Firefox. The frustrating thing is that the Firefox menu obscures the
Docs one, so you can't see all its options.
To get the Firefox menu out of the way and view your table-editing options, you need to
change your Firefox settings. Click Tools
Options
Content tab. On the Content
tab, find Enable JavaScript, and then click the Advanced button to its right. In the box
that opens, turn on the "Disable or replace context menus" checkbox. Click OK, and then
click OK again. Now, you should be able to see Docs-specific context menus without
Firefox's menu getting in the way.
2.5.5.3. Add, change, or remove a border
When you first insert a table ([click here]), Docs asks whether you want a border for it. You can always change
your mind later. To add a border to your table, right-click (control-click) the table. From the menu that pops up
(Figure 2-18), select "Change table". (If you prefer, you can click Table
"Modify table properties".) This
opens the Change Table box, which is pretty much identical to the Insert Table box (Figure 2-15) you used to
create the table. To make changes to the table's border, pick one of these options:
To add or change a border. In the Change Table box's Borders section, select a size and a color for the
border. (Just to give you an idea, the table shown in Figure 2-18 uses 3 for the border size.) Don't forget
to select a color—if the color box is blank, the border will be invisible.
To remove a border. In the Change Table box's Borders section, set Size to 0, and the border
disappears.
NOTE

When you remove a border from a table, Docs still shows the gridlines between cells in the text
editor. To make sure the table is border-free (and that you like the way that looks), click the
upper-right Share button, and then select "View as web page (Preview)".
2.5.5.4. Change a row, column, or cell
You can apply changes to a specific row, column, or even individual cell in your table. For example, you might
want to center the column headings, but have all the other rows left-aligned. Or, for a column that holds dollar
amounts, you might want that column right-aligned, while the others are centered or left-aligned.
When you want to make changes to a row, column, or cell, click the appropriate spot in your table, and then
select Table
"Modify row properties", "Modify column properties", or "Modify cell properties". Or you can
right-click (control-click) the spot you want, and then, from the menu that appears, select "Change row",
"Change column", or "Change cell". Whether you're altering a row, column, or cell, you have these options:
Size. You can adjust a column's width, for example, if it holds a lot of text that's getting squeezed into a
fixed-width cell that's too narrow to hold it.
Alignment. These settings adjust the horizontal and vertical alignment of text inside the cell, row, or
column. If you want your headings centered, for example, click the headings' row, select "Change row",
and then set Horizontal alignment to Center.
Background color. Changing the background color of a particular cell, row, or column is a great way to
call attention to it. You can also alternate colors between rows or columns to make the table more
readable.
2.5.5.5. Delete a table
If your table didn't work out as you'd planned, you can delete it in three clicks: Right-click (control-click) the
table, select "Delete table", and then click OK to confirm. Or use this trio of clicks: Table
"Delete table", and
then OK to confirm.

Workaround Workshop: Creating Columns of Text
Google Docs doesn't let you select some text and, with the click of a button, reformat that text
into columns (think newspaper layout). But with a little bit of creative fiddling, you can still achieve
the column look.
Imagine that a page with multiple columns is really just one page-size table with only one row:
When you reach the bottom of the first column, you start typing in the second, and so on. In other
words, you're using a full-page table with invisible gridlines between the columns.
To compose your columns of text, first insert a table ([click here]). In the Insert Table box, set the
table to have one row and at least two columns. Create the table, and then start typing in the first
column. To see how your columns look, click Preview. To increase the amount of space between
columns, right-click (control-click) the table, select "Change table", and then increase the padding,
the spacing, or both (see [click here]).
When you use this method to create columns, make sure your table doesn't have any borders (in
the Border section of the Insert Table box, Size should be 0). Although you see the table's
gridlines as you type, they don't show up when you preview, print ([click here]), or publish ([click
here]) the document.
The end result is columns of text—and no one will ever know it's actually a table.
2.5.6. Printing a Document
Printing from Google Docs is as simple as printing from any other word processor. Open the document you want
to print, and your hard copy is just a hop, skip, and click away:
You've got two ways to print: Click the upper-left Print button (it has a picture of a tiny printer on it) or
select File
Print.
Whichever one you choose, the Print Settings box, shown in Figure 2-19, opens.
Figure 2-19. Here's where you tell Docs what you want your printed document to look
like.
1.

Make sure the settings are what you want: paper orientation (portrait or landscape), paper size, margin
widths, and page numbering on or off. When everything looks good, click OK.
Docs saves your settings, and then creates a PDF file of your document, which opens in Adobe Reader, to
show you what the printed page(s) will look like. At the same time, you get a Print box like the one in
Figure 2-20.
Figure 2-20. Adobe Reader shows you how your document will look when it's printed.
The Print box also shows a preview and a bunch of settings you can tweak. Click OK to
send the document to the printer.
2.

Check the settings in the Print box, make any necessary changes, and then click OK.
Your computer sends the PDF to your printer, and you get a copy of your document that you can hold in
your hands.
If you're working on a computer that doesn't have Adobe Reader, and you need to
print your document, click Share
"View as web page (Preview)" to open the
formatted document as a Web page. In the browser window that shows your
document, select File
Print, and then click OK to print the document. If you
print a document this way, the formatting isn't quite as good as in the PDF—and
you probably have the browser's header and footer—but all the content is there.
3.
2.5.7. Deleting a Document
When you want to get rid of a document, you have two options: Delete it when you're viewing it in the text
editor, or nix it from the Docs list. If you delete a document and then change your mind, you can retrieve it
from the Trash (as long as you haven't emptied the Trash). The following sections explain how.
2.5.7.1. Delete a document from the text editor
When you're viewing a document and decide you don't want it any more, delete it by clicking File
Delete. A
confirmation box opens; click OK. Docs moves the document to the Trash.

NOTE
When you return to the Docs home page, you may have to click your browser's Refresh button to make
the deleted file disappear from your Docs list.
2.5.7.2. Delete a document from the Docs list
In the Docs home page's Docs list, select a document by turning on its checkbox. Click the Delete button (the
one with a picture of a trash can), and Docs dumps the file in the Trash.
If you mistakenly deleted the wrong file, at the top of the page, click Undo in the yellow box to get it back. Or
read the next section to learn how to fish a document out of the Trash.
2.5.7.3. Retrieve a deleted document
Goodbye doesn't always mean forever. If you get rid of a document by mistake, or you just change your mind,
you can find it in the Trash, and then restore it to the Docs list or a folder:
In the Docs home page's left-hand menu, make sure All Items is expanded (click the + sign next to it, if
necessary). Then select Trash.
Docs displays your Trash folder's contents.
1.
Select the file you want to restore (turn on its checkbox), and then click Undelete. You can select and
restore more than one file at a time.
Docs removes the file from the Trash, and puts it back where it came from. If you deleted it from the Docs
list, then it's back there now. If you deleted it from a folder, then it's back in that folder, too.
2.
2.5.7.4. Empty the Trash folder
There's really no need to empty the Trash in Google Docs—you can store up to 5,000 documents, spreadsheets,
and presentations in your account. But if you're in the mood for a little housecleaning, just open the Trash
folder, and then click the "Empty trash" button. Docs asks whether you're sure, since files deleted from the
Trash are gone for good. Click OK, and your Trash folder is empty.
2.5.7.5. Change a document's ownership
When you create a document, you own it. And if you share that document with other people ([click here]), you
still own it. When you delete a shared document that you own, Google trashes it for everyone, not just you.
Sometimes, though, you might not want that to happen. For example, you might change jobs, and you don't
need documents related to the old job any more, but the coworkers you're leaving behind sure do. If you want
to delete a document from your Docs list while leaving it intact for those with whom you share, then you can
transfer ownership of that document to somebody else.

On the Docs home page, find the document you want to transfer, turn on its checkbox, and then click Delete.
Docs opens the box shown in Figure 2-21, asking whether you want to transfer ownership to somebody else.
Click "Choose new owner", and Docs opens the box in Figure 2-22 to let you pick the document's lucky new
owner.
Figure 2-21. When you're about to delete a shared document that you own, Google asks whether
you'd rather transfer ownership to someone else or put the document in the Trash folders of
everyone with whom you share it.
You can transfer ownership to anyone who has a Google Account, even if he's never shared the document
before. Type in the new owner's email address or choose from your Contacts list. If you want, customize the
notification email that Google sends to let the new owner know about the transfer. Then click "Change owner" to
transfer ownership.
Figure 2-22. To transfer ownership of a document, tell Google the email address of the new owner.

When you transfer ownership of a document, you become a collaborator on the document ([click here] explains
the difference between owners and collaborators). Now, you can delete the document from your Docs list
without moving everyone else's copy to the Trash at the same time.
NOTE
The new owner can't refuse ownership of the document but can transfer ownership to somebody else.
 

 
2.6. Editing Documents Offline
Since Google's computers store your documents, you can access those documents from anywhere you can
connect to the Internet. But what about times when you're not online, but you still need access to your stuff?
Like when you're on a plane and you need to work on a presentation or in a hotel room with spotty Internet
access. No problem. This section tells you how to set up your computer so you can edit and save documents
offline.
NOTE
At this writing, you can view and edit word processor documents offline, and view (but not edit)
spreadsheets offline. You can't work with presentations offline at all. And even though you can edit any
existing word processing documents while you're offline, you have to be connected to the Internet to
create a new document.
2.6.1. Install Google Gears
Before you can edit your documents offline, you need to download and install Google Gears. Gears works with
your Web browser to let you open, read, edit, and save documents even when you're not online. (The
documents get stored on your computer.) The next time you connect to the Internet (using the same computer
and browser) and sign into Google Docs, Google automatically syncs the documents in your Docs account with
the work you did offline.
To install Google Gears, your computer and browser must be one of these combinations:
Mac OS X 10.2 or higher, with Firefox 1.5 or higher
Windows XP or Vista with Firefox 1.5 or higher
Windows XP or Vista with Internet Explorer 6 or higher
Linux with Firefox 1.5 or higher
Windows Mobile 5 or higher with Internet Explorer 4.01 or higher
If your computer meets these requirements, point your Web browser to http://gears.google.com. (If you're on
your Google Docs home page, you can click the upper-right Offline link; in the dialog box that opens, click "Get
Google Gears now".) On the main Google Gears page, click the big blue Install Google Gears button.
Google opens a page that shows its Terms of Service and Privacy Policy (see the box on [click here] for the

highlights). If you want, turn on the checkbox that lets Google collect anonymous information about how you
use Google Gears. If you'd rather not share that info, leave the checkbox turned off. Then click the Agree and
Download button.
Google opens the page shown in Figure 2-23, and your computer asks for your okay to download the file. Click
Save File to start the super-quick download. When you've got the file on your computer (it's called
GoogleGearsSetup.exe), open it to start the installation. (Since you've downloaded a program, your computer
may ask for your approval before running it. If that happens, click OK.)
Figure 2-23. Before you can edit documents offline, you have to download and install Google Gears.
Click Save File to download the Google Gears installer. After Gears is installed, you have to restart
your Web browser to make it work.
The setup program installs Google Gears on your computer. You need to close your Web browser, and then
restart it to finish the installation.
2.6.2. Set up Docs to Work with Google Gears
When you return to the Google Docs home page, you see the security warning shown in Figure 2-24. This
warning tells you that the site you're on wants to use Google Gears to access and store information on your
computer. The site is Google Docs, so that's what you want. Turn on the checkbox that says, "I trust this site",
and then click Allow.
Figure 2-24. Google Gears checks to make sure that you trust a site before it syncs the site with your
computer. If you're using your own computer and the site you're signing into is your own Docs
account, you can safely click Allow, and then continue.

Next, Gears asks if you want to create a Google Docs shortcut on your computer's desktop. Clicking this
shortcut launches Google Docs when you're offline. Choose Yes if you want the shortcut, No if you don't (you
can always create a shortcut later—[click here] shows you how).
Using Google Gears to sync your Docs account with a public computer (at a library, for
example) could give other people access to your documents. To make sure your private
documents stay private, don't edit offline on a public or shared computer. If you're using
a public computer and you see a message asking you to turn on Gears, like the one in
Figure 2-24, then click Cancel.
Google synchronizes the documents on your computer with the ones in your Google Docs account. Syncing
means that Google's making sure the documents are the same in your account and on your computer, so you
can open and work on the same documents whether you're connected to the Internet or not. As Google syncs
your documents, it shows a yellow bar at the top of your screen, and a status box in the upper right, both
shown in Figure 2-25, to indicate the sync's progress. This process might take a few minutes. When the status
box says Synchronized, you're all set to work offline.
Figure 2-25. Here, Google has just finished synchronizing documents between Google Docs and a
computer, so you can work offline. The checkmark in a green circle (circled) means that you're
currently online. When you're offline, this symbol changes to a gray No symbol (a circle with a
diagonal line through it).

2.6.3. Work Offline
After you've installed Google Gears and synched your documents, you're ready to work offline. The next time
you're working offline on the computer where you installed Google Gears, either click the Google Docs shortcut
on your Desktop (if you created one) or open your Web browser and then, in the address bar, type
docs.google.com. Even though you're not connected to the Internet, your browser opens the page shown in
Figure 2-26. This page tells you that you're signing in offline and asks for the email address you use to sign into
Docs—no password's necessary for offline editing.
Figure 2-26. When you open your browser and go to http://docs.google.com while you're not
connected to the Internet, you see this page. Sign in with the email address you use to sign into your
Google Account.

After you've signed in, your browser opens the Docs home page. This page looks just like it does when you work
online, except that, next to your email address, in the upper-right part of the screen, is a gray No symbol: a
circle with a diagonal line through it. This symbol's the offline indicator, showing that you're not connected to
the Internet. When the offline indicator appears, you can edit documents just as you normally would in Docs:
From the Docs home page, click any document to open it in a new window for editing. Google lets you know
that you're editing in offline mode, as Figure 2-26 shows. When you're done editing, click "Save & close". Back
on the Docs home page, your edited document is labeled "Edited offline".
If the offline indicator changes from a gray No symbol to a red circle with an
exclamation mark inside, Gears is warning you that your offline edits aren't being saved.
If you see this symbol, stop working on the document. If possible, don't turn off your
computer or close the browser window that holds the document, or your changes will be
lost. As soon as you can, reconnect to the Internet so Google can sync the work you've
done with Docs.
The next time you connect to the Internet (using the computer you edited on) and sign into Google Docs,
Google synchronizes your documents automatically—you don't have to lift a finger. You know a sync is
happening when the upper-right green circle shows two arrows chasing each other around in a circle. When the
circle changes to a checkmark, your documents are synched, meaning that Google has uploaded the changes
you made offline. After a sync, Google removes the "Edited offline" label from your document.

NOTE
To sync your documents, you have to connect to the Internet, and then sign into Google Docs using the
same computer and the same browser you used while editing offline.
2.6.4. Offline Editing and Collaborating
As [click here] explains, Docs lets you share documents and work on them simultaneously with other people.
When you collaborate online, changes you make to a document show up in the document right away. When you
work offline, however, any edits you make are stored on your computer until you connect to the Internet again,
and then sign into Docs—your collaborators don't see the changes you made until Google syncs the documents
on your computer with Google Docs.
But what happens if you're editing a document offline and someone else is working on it at the same time,
creating a conflict between the two versions? In that case, you see a box like the one in Figure 2-27. This notice
appears when you open the document that contains the conflicting edits.
Figure 2-27. When edits you made offline conflict with the current version of a shared document,
Google lets you know. Because you edited an older version of the document, Google discards your
changes. You can copy them and paste them back in, or find your edits in the document's revision
history ([click here]).

Google notifies you that it's tossed out your recent changes, showing you the affected edits. In the background
is the current version of the document (the one without your changes). If you want to paste your changes into
the current version, select them, press Ctrl+C (
-C) to copy them, click OK, and the notice box disappears.
Click the document where you want to paste your changes back in, then press Ctrl+V (
-V) to paste.
Google uploads your offline edits and saves them as a version of the document before it
checks for a conflict and discards them. So you can also find your changes by checking
the document's revision history, and comparing the version you edited offline with the
current version ([click here] tells you how to compare two documents in the revision
history).
2.6.5. Adjust Your Offline Access Settings
Google offers a couple of options for your offline settings. To tweak them, click the online/offline status indicator
(the upper-right checkmark or No symbol next to your email address). In the box that opens, click Settings to
open the Offline Access Settings box shown in Figure 2-28, where you can change these settings:
Create desktop shortcut. If you want fast access to Google Docs from your computer's Desktop
(whether you're online or off), click this button. The shortcut is a little picture of a pencil and some paper;
click it to go straight to Google Docs in a new browser window or tab.
Figure 2-28. Offline Access Settings are limited to creating a desktop shortcut to Docs or
disabling Google Gears.

Reset and disable offline access. If you decide you'd rather be connected to the Internet and signed
into your Google Account as you work, then you can turn off your computer's ability to work offline. Click
this button, and Google disables Google Gears on your computer.
When you disable offline editing, the status indicator on the Google Docs home
page is replaced by the word Offline. If you change your mind and want to edit
offline again, click Offline. In the box that appears, click "Enable offline access",
and Docs turns Google Gears back on, and syncs your documents.
 

 
2.7. Sharing and Collaborating on Documents
When Google Docs first appeared, the thing that really got everybody talking was how easy it is to share
documents and collaborate on them in real time. Not only can you share a Google doc, you can invite other
people to work on it with you. For example, imagine planning the guest list for a wedding—when the bride lives
in Chicago, her parents live in Boston, the groom is in Berlin on a business trip, and his parents live in Phoenix.
It's not like everyone can gather around a table and finalize the list. But with Google Docs, they can all work on
the same guest list (despite being in different time zones) by adding and deleting names, making comments,
and getting everything set in time to order the invitations.
This section explains the different ways you can share a Google doc with others, from emailing it to inviting
folks to roll up their sleeves and work on it with you.
NOTE
If you use Google Docs through your organization's Google Apps account (you sign in through a company
Web site instead of going to www.docs.google.com), your domain administrator can limit your ability to
share documents with people who don't work for your organization. (See Chapter 10 for details.) In that
case, you might find that you can't invite someone from outside your organization to share documents or
receive sharing invitations from people who don't work with you. You can still send and receive
documents as attachments, though, but you can't edit them together in real time.
2.7.1. Emailing a Document
Perhaps the most obvious way to share a document is to email it as an attachment. In Google Docs, you can put
the finishing touches on your document, and then share it with the world (or maybe just a friend or two) via
email. Unlike inviting collaborators to work on a document with you, emailing gives the recipient his own copy,
so he can work on it in Word or another word processing program.
To email a document from the Google Docs text editor, follow these steps:
Open the document you want to email, and then click Share
"Email as attachment".
Docs opens the Email Document box shown in Figure 2-29.
1.
Enter the info Google needs to send your email:
The email address(es) you want it sent to. You can choose these addresses from your Gmail
Contacts list ([click here]). (If you're sending to more than one person, put a comma between
addresses.)
How you want the document sent (in the body of the email or as an attachment).
2.

A Subject line (prefilled with your document's title).
An optional message.
Whether you want a copy of the email sent to you.
When you've got all that set, click Send, and Docs emails your document.
Figure 2-29. Type in the addresses of recipients, or (if you have a Gmail account) choose them from
your Contacts list ([click here]). You can email a document either as the body of the email or as an
attachment.
2.7.1.1. Email to collaborators
If you've invited other people to view a document or collaborate with you on it ([click here]), you can send the
document to everyone you've shared it with in one easy step. This is a handy way to distribute a final copy
before a sign-off meeting, for example.
If you've shared a document, then when you click the Email link, the Email Document box looks like the one in
Figure 2-30. The names of the people you've shared with appear in the To area. Add or remove recipients by

turning the checkboxes by their names on or off. Fill out the rest of the box as necessary, and then click Send to
dispatch your document in a flurry of emails.
Figure 2-30. Docs makes it easy to send a document to everyone who's been collaborating on it. You
can tailor the To list by turning checkboxes on or off.
2.7.2. Publishing a Document on the Web
You can also share a document by publishing it on the Web. Because Google docs are actual Web pages, this is
super easy to do. You can publish a Google doc as a Web page or post it directly on your blog. You do both
those things from the Publish This Document page, shown in Figure 2-31 (click the upper-right Share button,
and then select "Publish as web page" to get there).
Figure 2-31. When you're ready to share a document with the world, in the upper-right, click Share
"Publish as web page" to open this page. The top half of the page is for publishing the document
as a Web page; the bottom half is for publishing it as a blog post.

2.7.2.1. Publish a document as a Web page
When you publish a Google doc as a Web page, Google creates a home on the Web just for your document,
giving it a unique URL. From there, you can create links to the document or send the URL to others so they can
see it.
You won't believe how easy it is to publish a document as a Web page:
Open the document you want to publish, and go to Share
"Publish as web page".
Docs opens the page shown in Figure 2-31.
1.
If you want the Web page you're about to create to reflect changes you make to the document, then turn
on the "Automatically republish when changes are made" checkbox.
If you tend to write several drafts between publishable versions, leave this checkbox turned off, or else
those not-quite-there drafts will get published, too. (When you're ready to publish changes, come back
here and follow these steps.)
2.
Click the "Publish document" button.
Google publishes your document to the Web ,and opens a page like the one shown in Figure 2-32. This
page shows you the address, in the form of a link to your new Web page. Click the link to check out your
masterpiece. On your Docs home page, in your Docs list ([click here]), Google marks the document as
"published".
3.

Figure 2-32. When you publish a doc on the Web, Google creates a unique address for it (circled).
This is the address you can give to your friends so they can see your document online.
Now you can link to the page where your document lives, and share it with others. Just send them the Web
address Google created, and they can view your document.
2.7.2.2. Publish a document as a blog post
If you're one of the dozen or so Earthlings who still don't have a blog, you probably don't have a lot of interest
in publishing your Google docs this way. (If you want to start a blog, go to www.blogger.com, sign in using your
Google Account login info, and complete the brief registration process.)
You can create, edit, and save documents in Google Docs, and then post them straight to your blog when you're
ready to take them live. Before you can do that, though, you have to tell Google Docs about your blog. (You do
that on your Google Docs Settings page, as explained on [click here].)
If you want to publish a document to your blog but you haven't yet put your blog info in
Google Docs, then click Share
"Publish as web page", anyway. If you click the "Post
to blog" button and Docs doesn't have any info about your blog, then the Blog Site
Settings window opens so you can get your blog all set up.
After Google Docs has the info it needs, here's all you have to do to publish a document as a blog post:
1.

Open the document you want to publish, and then click Share
"Publish as web page" to see the page
shown in Figure 2-31.
1.
Click the "Post to blog" button.
A confirmation box appears.
2.
Click OK.
Docs adds the document as a post on your blog.
3.
Couldn't get much simpler, could it?
NOTE
Documents you publish to a blog aren't marked "published" in your Docs list. Google reserves that label
for documents published as Web pages.
2.7.2.3. Update a published document or blog post
After you've published a document on the Web, you can edit it, and then update the published version. Whether
you're updating a Web page or a blog post, the process is pretty much the same:
Open the document, make any necessary changes, and then click Share
"Publish as web page".
Docs opens the Publish This Document page. Since you've already published the document, the buttons on
this page have changed, as shown in Figure 2-33.
Figure 2-33. This document has been published as both a Web page and a blog post, so
both sets of buttons (circled) have changed. After you've published a document, your
options on the Publish This Document page are to republish (update) the document, or
to stop publishing it on a Web page, or remove the post from your blog.
1.

Click the appropriate Republish button: "Republish document" to update the Web page; "Republish post"
to update your blog.
If you're updating a Web page, you're all done. If you're updating a blog post, you've got one more step.
2.
For blog posts, Google opens a box asking you to confirm you want to republish your post; click OK.
Google updates your blog.
If you've published a document as a Web page, you can update it automatically, so
you don't have to go back to the Publish This Document page and click Republish
every time you make a change. Click Share
"Publish as web page", and then
turn on the "Automatically republish when changes are made" checkbox. Now,
when you edit the document, the published version changes, too. You don't have to
lift a finger.
3.
2.7.2.4. Remove a published document or blog post
When you want to remove a published document from the Web or erase a post from your blog, open the
document, and then click Share
"Publish as web page" to get to the Publish This Document page, shown in
Figure 2-33. Then do one of the following:
For a document. Click the "Stop publishing" button. Google removes the Web page. Now, if someone
follows that URL, she lands on the Google Docs sign-in page.

For a blog post. Click the "Remove from blog" button. In the box that opens, click OK to confirm, and
Google takes the post off your blog.
2.7.3. Collaborating with Others
Collaborating is one of the best reasons for using Google Docs. If you've used a document repository like
SharePoint—where one person checks out a document, works on it a bit, and then has to check it back in before
somebody else can edit it—get ready to change the way you think about collaboration. With Google Docs, you
and your collaborators can edit a document simultaneously. Yup, you and up to nine of your closest friends can
all work on the same document at the same time, from any computer (or Web-ready phone, for that matter)
with Internet access.
For example, imagine a group of college students working on a report. Each student is responsible for one
section of the report. Jenna is at a computer terminal in the library, typing up a summary of her research.
Across town in his apartment, Luke inserts a chart. At the campus coffee shop, Lisa edits Ben's section on her
laptop, while Ben—who's visiting his parents—uses Dad's computer to edit Lisa's section. When Google Docs
saves a version of the document (which it does every couple of minutes—see [click here]), each student sees
the edits and additions all the others have made.
Real-time collaboration means your work gets done faster, because you can see changes as they're made, and
respond to them immediately. And you don't have to wait around for other people to do their work before you
can do yours.
2.7.3.1. Types of sharing
When you create a document, you own it. And that means you can do pretty much anything you want to with it,
like edit, delete, or share it with others. If you're in the mood to share, Google Docs lets you pick between two
ways of sharing with each person:
Viewers. These folks can read your document, and export it to their computers. They can't, however, edit
the document in Google Docs or invite anyone else to work on the document.
Collaborators. These people can both read and edit the document. They can also export a copy of the
document to their computers as, say, a Word or OpenOffice document (see [click here]). And—if you give
them permission to do so—they can invite more people to collaborate.
Whether you invite someone as a collaborator or a viewer depends on your purpose in sharing your document.
If you want to share the first chapter of your Great American Novel but you don't want anyone messing with
your immortal prose, invite people as viewers. If you're soliciting comments on the agenda for next week's
budget meeting, invite them as collaborators. The next few sections explain how.
2.7.3.2. The Share This Document page
Mom always said it's nice to share. In a Google document, you do that by clicking the right-hand Share button,
and then clicking "Share with others". This opens the Share This Document page, shown in Figure 2-34.

Figure 2-34. In the Share This Document page's three main sections, you can invite others to share
your document, set permissions, and view sharing status. When you've added an email address (or
several) to the "Invite people" text box, click the Invite button (circled). The exact label on this
button reflects the kind of sharing you chose: collaborating or viewing.
The Share This Document page has several sections:
Invite people. No big mystery what this section's about—it's where you select the people with whom you
want to share the document. These people can be viewers (who can read the document but not change it)
or collaborators (who can both read and edit the document). Type in email addresses for the folks you
want to share with (separate multiple addresses with commas) or, if you have Gmail, select people from
your Contacts list ([click here]).
If you choose viewers or collaborators from your Gmail Contacts list ([click here]),
you get the chance to create a group ([click here]) containing those contacts.
Saving them as a group lets you email the whole list of collaborators or viewers
directly from Gmail.
Advanced permissions. If you don't mind if collaborators invite even more people to the party, leave the
"Collaborators may invite others" checkbox turned on; if you want to share only with those you invite, turn
it off. If you've got a single mailing list with lots of names, and you want to invite everyone on it, then
turn on the "Invitations may be used by anyone" checkbox. For example, say you belong to a knitting

group, and sending an email to the address knitters@knitmadness.com results in every person in the
group getting email sent to his personal email account. This is a mailing list—one email address that
actually sends to a bunch of different people. If you send a Docs-sharing invitation to a mailing list, leave
this checkbox turned on so everyone who receives the invitation can see your document.
NOTE
Even in Google Docs, collaboration has its limits: You can invite up to 200 viewers, collaborators,
or a combination of the two. And no more than 10 of those people can look at or work on a
document at any given time.
Sharing information. If you haven't shared a document with anyone yet, the right side of the Share This
Document page announces, "This document is not shared" (as shown in Figure 2-34). If the document is
shared, it says, "This document is currently shared", and lists whom it's shared with. You can manage your
viewers and collaborators here, as Figure 2-35 shows.
Figure 2-35. After you've shared the document with others, information about them appears here.
From here, you can email all your collaborators, all your viewers, or everyone; schedule an event for
you and those you're sharing with using Google Calendar (Chapter 7); or stop sharing with certain
people (see [click here]).

2.7.3.3. Invite collaborators or viewers
Now that you're familiar with the Share This Document page, you can use it to quickly and easily invite others to
view your document or work on it with you. On the Share This Document page, enter the email addresses of the
people with whom you want to share. Since viewers and collaborators have different access permissions (see
[click here]), Docs treats them as different groups, and you have to issue separate invitations for each group.
When you click the Invite Collaborators (or Invite Viewers) button, you see the box shown in Figure 2-36.
Figure 2-36. Customize Google's invitation email so the recipients will know what you're inviting
them to view or collaborate on. The email's Subject field automatically shows your document's title.

To see how your document will look to the viewers you're about to invite (those people
who can read the document but not edit it), click the Share This Document page's
"Preview document as a viewer" link. If the preview doesn't look quite right to you, then
go back and edit the document before you share it.
In the box, compose a message (if you want to). Docs automatically inserts a link to the document into the
email it sends, so you don't have to worry about telling others where to find the document. You can paste a
copy of the document right into the body of the email (just turn on the first checkbox). And if you want a copy
of the invitation, then turn on the "CC me" checkbox. Click Send to invite the people you've chosen to share
your document with. When you share a document with other Google Docs users, that document appears on
their Docs lists.
NOTE
Not everyone requires a formal invitation. For example, maybe you announced to your colleagues at the
last meeting that everyone would be working on the CHAOS project this week, so everyone already
knows about it. Your company uses Google Apps (Chapter 10), so you know everyone has her own Docs
account. If you want to skip the invitation email and just add collaborators or viewers to your document,
then click "Skip sending invitation". Your collaborators won't get an invitation email, but they will find the
document in their Docs list the next time they sign in.
2.7.3.4. Work with collaborators

When you've invited someone to work with you on a document, that person can get started on it right away.
Google automatically adds it to the Docs list on her Docs home page, so she can open it and get to work. If
you're working on a document at the same time as one of your collaborators, the other person's name appears
in a little box at the bottom of the screen. (And your name appears on that person's screen, as well.) Take a
peek at Figure 2-37 to see what this looks like.
When Google Docs saves the document, creating a new revision ([click here]), it incorporates all the changes
made by you and your collaborator(s), updating the document in real time.
If you're working on a document with a collaborator, use Google Talk to communicate
via instant messaging as you work. Chapter 6 tells you all about Google Talk.
Figure 2-37. Click a comment to edit it. You can edit any part of the comment (including the
commenter's name and the date/time stamp), or choose one of the menu options. If someone else is
editing the document at the same time, your collaborator's name appears in a box at the bottom of
the screen (circled).
Docs' comments feature is a good way to collaborate. You insert comments ([click here]) by clicking Insert
Comment, or by right-clicking (control-clicking) in your document, and then, from the menu that appears,
choosing Insert Comment. When you insert a comment, Docs stamps it with your name, the date, and the time.
After you've created a comment, you can work with it in various ways. Click a comment to edit it. (Collaborators

can edit each others' comments.) Clicking a comment opens the menu shown in Figure 2-37, which has these
options:
Close this menu. Clicking anywhere outside the menu also closes it, so this option is kind of an
unnecessary waste of mouse-pointing.
Delete comment. When a comment is no longer apropos, choosing this option gets rid of it.
Insert comment text into document. Sometimes a comment is so good it ought to be in the document
itself. This option changes the comment into regular text, which you can then edit as part of the
document. Doing this inserts the whole comment—including the commenter's name and the time
stamp—so be sure to delete anything you don't want in the final document.
Comment color. Comments are highlighted to call attention to them. Change the highlight color by
selecting from this list: yellow (used automatically), orange, pink, green, blue, or purple. When you've got
several collaborators working on a document, it's helpful to assign each person a comment color so you
can tell at a glance who made each comment.
Comments appear in Docs' text editor, but not in a printed document. If you want
comments to appear in the printed document, convert them to text, and then highlight
them to mark them as comments.
Real-time, simultaneous editing is a great feature that can really speed up your workflow. Some people might
get a little nervous, though, at the thought of too many cooks spoiling your Google Docs broth. Don't worry: If a
collaborator makes changes you don't like, you can roll back the document to a previous version. See [click
here] to find out how.
When more than one person works on the same section at the same time, Docs tries to merge their edits. For
example, say you and your coworker Laura are setting up the schedule for a conference. You're both editing the
schedule at the same time, and you both jumped in to work on the first item. You type 8:00–10:00 Registration
and Laura types 8:00 Coffee and pastries. (You know Laura typed that because Docs shows her name in the
lower-right part of the screen as you both work; your name is in the same spot on her screen.) Google checks
every few seconds to refresh the document as you both work. When Google refreshes, you'll see something like
this on your screen: 8:00–10:00 Registration Coffee and pastries, combining your text with Laura's.
If your edits conflict with the work someone else is doing, you can give that person a call or send her an instant
message using Google Talk (Chapter 6) to straighten out who should be working on what. Or you can just work
on another part of the document until Laura is done with her edits (you'll know she's finished when her name
disappears from your screen), and then go back and make whatever changes you want. When you save the
document, your edits become the current version.

When you've got several collaborators editing the same document all at once, it's a
good idea to have each collaborator choose a different color for his text to help sort out
who made what changes. (The simplest thing is to have each person use the same text
and highlight color.) Then, when you finalize the document, simply select all (Ctrl+A [
-A]), and then click the "Text color" button to change the rainbow of text colors to basic
black.
2.7.3.5. Remove a collaborator
One bad apple can spoil the whole barrel—and one bad collaborator can do similarly nasty things to your
document. There are lots of reasons why you might want to remove a collaborator from your Google doc: That
person's phase of the project is over, or a colleague left your organization, or somebody's spelling is so
atrocious that even the best spell checker isn't up to the task. Whatever your reasons, you can easily remove
any viewer or collaborator from your document.
Open the document, and then click Share
"Share with others" to get to the page shown back in Figure 2-35.
Collaborators and viewers are listed on the right side of the page. To remove all the collaborators you've
invited, find the Collaborators heading, and then click the "remove all" link to its right. (The Viewers section has
its own "remove all" link.) To remove an individual collaborator or viewer, find that person's name in the
Collaborators or Viewers list, and then click the X to the right of his name; the person disappears from the list.
After you've removed a collaborator or viewer from your document, that person no longer has any access at all
to the document. Say Fred has been taken off the CHAOS project, so he won't need to edit the CHAOS
prospectus. You remove Fred from the Collaborators list, and the next time he signs in to Google Docs, the
CHAOS prospectus is no longer in his Docs list. (If he exported a copy of the prospectus, he still has that copy
on his computer, but he can't work on your version in Google Docs.)
Frequently Asked Question: Who's That Collaborator?
I invited some people to share my document, but there's a name in the Collaborators list that I
don't recognize. How did it get there? And should I remove the stranger at once?
Occasionally, you may see a name you don't recognize pop up in a document's Collaborators list.
Don't panic: It doesn't necessarily mean somebody's hacked your Google Account. When an
unfamiliar name—or the name of someone you know but swear you didn't invite—shows up on
your collaborator's list, ask yourself these questions:
When you shared your document, did you turn on the "Collaborators may invite
others" checkbox? This setting lets anyone you share with send out her own invitations to
collaborate. So the unfamiliar name may have been invited by someone you invited. If you
don't want collaborators to bring guests along, then turn off this checkbox when you send
out sharing invitations.
Did you share using a mailing list? If you used a mailing list ([click here]) to send
multiple invitations at once, there's a good chance that the unfamiliar name is someone from
that list. If the list is big, you can easily forget precisely who's on it. To make sure you know
precisely whom you've invited, turn off the Share This Document page's "Invitations may be
used by anyone" checkbox. This way, entire mailing lists can't be invited.

Is the same person listed twice? Either you're seeing double or your friend has mastered
the art of cloning, right? Fortunately, there's a third explanation: This can happen if you sent
the invitation to one email address, but the recipient used your invitation to sign in with
another Google Account user name and password. (This can happen if your friend uses email
forwarding.) So the same person may appear twice in your Collaborators or Viewers list:
once with the email address you sent the invitation to (bob@yahoo.com, say), and again
with a different address—the one he used to sign into Google (like bob@gmail.com). If
you're not sure which is which, send your friend an email to the original address and ask
which address he uses to sign in. Then remove the other address from your Collaborators or
Viewers list to keep things tidy.
Could it be someone you actually invited? This question isn't as dumb as it may sound.
It's possible that, after accepting your invitation, your collaborator changed his Docs display
name. (Anyone can do that on the Settings page [see [click here]].) If Joe Smith wakes up
one morning and decides to distinguish himself in the world by being henceforth known as
Starshine Snugglebunny, he can change to his new name in Docs. When he does, Starshine
Snugglebunny suddenly appears on your Collaborators list. Contact Joe (er, Starshine) to
make sure the name is really his. (And while you're at it, ask him if he's been working too
hard.)
2.7.3.6. View a document's RSS feed
As [click here] explains, RSS feeds summarize and provide links to Web site and blog content, regularly
updating these content snippets in real time. In Google Docs, you can view an RSS feed that shows changes to
a particular document. First, make sure your Docs account is set up to allow RSS feeds ([click here]). Then,
open the document, and click Share
"Share with others". On the right-hand side of the page, click "View RSS
feed of document changes" link. This opens a page like the one in Figure 2-38.
Figure 2-38. You can view an RSS feed of changes to any document in your Google Docs account. To
subscribe to a document's feed (so you can check for recent changes from your Bookmarks toolbar),
click Subscribe Now (circled). This figure shows the RSS feed in Firefox. If you use Internet
Explorer, then the screen has the same information, it's just arranged slightly differently.

2.7.3.7. Subscribe to a document's RSS feed
When you view a document's RSS feed, you can subscribe to that feed. It's as easy as clicking a button. Open
the document, and then click Share
"Share with others"
"View RSS feed of document changes". What you
do next depends on your browser:
Firefox. Choose the newsreader you want, and then click the Subscribe Now button (shown in Figure 2-
38). Firefox adds the feed to your Bookmarks toolbar.
Internet Explorer. Click the "Subscribe to this feed" link. IE opens a box where you can name the link
and choose a reader. Do that, and then click Subscribe. IE adds the document to your Feeds.
2.7.4. Turn Back Time: Your Doc's Revision History
Whether you collaborate with others or work alone, you can view and compare different versions of your
evolving document. Whenever Google saves one of your docs (which it does automatically every couple of
minutes), it creates a new revision of that doc. A revision is a snapshot of the document as it exists at a
particular moment in time.
Click File
"Revision history" to see the versions of your document that Docs has been quietly amassing while
you work, as shown in Figure 2-39.

Figure 2-39. Click File
"Revision history" to see how your document has changed over time. Each
item on the list is a separate version of the document. The list's three columns (circled) help you
keep track of what changed by numbering each saved revision, noting who edited that version and
when, and giving an idea of the changes made, if any.
2.7.4.1. View a document's revision history
When you click File
"Revision history", you see your document's track record: Every time you save a change
(and every time Docs does an autosave), Docs creates a new revision and adds it to the top of the Revision
history list. As you might imagine, these versions can pile up fast, so the Revisions list focuses on the most
recent ones. It gathers older revisions into links, displayed on the right-hand side of the page (for example,
Figure 2-39 shows a link to "Revisions 7–19".) Click the link to display those revisions.
The Revisions list has three columns:
Revision. Every time Docs creates a new revision, it gives that revision a number; the higher the number,
the more recent the revision.
Last Edited. This column gives the date of the last revision, and the name of the person who edited it. (If
you're the only one working on a document—you haven't shared it with any collaborators—this column
just lists "Me".)
Changes. Look here for a clue about the changes made in a particular revision. You could have a
document open and not make any changes to it for a while—say you forget to close the document before
you head out for lunch. Docs still autosaves it, creating a new revision every few minutes and adding it to
the list. If a saved revision doesn't have any changes from the previous version, the Changes column says
"no text added".

If you want to look at a particular revision, click its name, and Docs displays it, as shown in Figure 2-40.
Figure 2-40. You can view, but not edit, a revision in this window. Above the document you see some
links and buttons (circled) that let you jump to other revisions or make this version the current one
(click "Revert to this one").
2.7.4.2. Revert to a previous version
When you click a revision in your Revisions list to view it, what you see is a read-only version of the document,
which means you can't edit it. To edit that revision, you have to make it the primary version of the document by
reverting to it.
Reverting simply means making an older version of the document into the current version. Here's the coolest
part: Reverting to a previous version does not destroy subsequent revisions; it simply makes the previous
version the current, editable one, and moves it to the top of the Revisions list as a brand-new version. So if you
revert to a previous version, and then change your mind—maybe you shouldn't have chucked all of Uncle
Danny's suggestions from the family reunion schedule—no sweat. Just click File
"Revision history", find the
version of the document with Uncle Danny's suggestions, and then revert to that one.
To revert to a previous version of a document, follow these steps:

Open the current version of the document, and then click File
"Revision history" to get to the page
shown back in Figure 2-39. On the Revisions list, find the version you want, and then click its Revision
Number on the left.
Docs opens a page showing the revision, like the one in Figure 2-40.
1.
Make sure this is the revision you want to use as the current version. Then click the upper-right "Revert to
this one" button.
Docs displays a confirmation box asking whether you really want to make the change.
2.
Click OK.
Docs makes this revision the current version of the document, and then opens the document in the text
editor.
3.
2.7.4.3. Compare revisions
When you've got a long list of revisions, it can be confusing to figure out which revision holds what. And if
you've got several people collaborating on a document and making changes to it, you might want to see at a
glance who did what from one version to another.
Docs can help you sort it all out by letting you compare two revisions to a document. First, open the document,
and click File
"Revision history". Then, turn on the checkboxes of the two versions you want to compare, and
then click the Compare Checked button. Docs displays the two revisions, as shown in Figure 2-41. Each
contributor who's worked on the document appears in the upper right, assigned a unique color to indicate who
made which change. Deletions appear as strikethrough text, additions as highlighted text. Whether deleted or
added, the text matches the color belonging to the person who made the change.
NOTE
You can compare only two revisions at a time.
Figure 2-41. When you compare two versions of a document, collaborators (Google calls them
Authors) appear in the upper-right part of the page (circled). Changes from one version to another
are color-coded to the collaborator who made them.

If you compare two versions of a document and want to revert to one of them, click the Back to Revision History
link. The Revisions list displays the two revisions you just compared. Turn on the checkbox of the one you want
to revert to, and then follow the steps on [click here].
 

 
2.8. Organizing and Finding Documents
It doesn't take very long to accumulate a long list of files in your Google Docs account. And just as it's hard to
put your hands on one particular memo when your desk is overflowing with papers, it can be difficult to find the
document you want on your Google Docs home page. (The words needle and haystack may come to mind.) To
be efficient, you've got to be organized. Fortunately, Google Docs makes that easy. And however you organize
your documents, you've got Google's searching power to help you find them.
2.8.1. Organizing Your Docs List
The Docs list on your Docs home page ([click here]) displays documents according to how recently you or a
collaborator has worked on them. Without any effort from you, this list offers a great organizational tool
because it groups documents according to when they were opened: today, yesterday, earlier the week, and so
on. If you know you last looked at a document a couple of weeks ago, you don't have to waste time scanning
today's or yesterday's files.
You can also use the home page's left-hand menu to display only certain groups of documents. For example, if
you've created any folders ([click here]), use the left-hand menu to show only the documents in a particular
folder. You can also display only docs you've shared with a particular collaborator, or just spreadsheet files. The
left-hand menu offers lots of options for sorting your files; [click here] explains them all.
2.8.1.1. Mark important documents
In elementary school, if you did a good job on your paper, the teacher gave you a gold star. In Google Docs,
you're in charge of distributing the gold stars. If there's a document you want to mark as urgent or otherwise
important, find it in the Docs list, and then click the star to the left of its name. The star turns gold to call
attention to that document. To turn a star off, just click it again.
You can easily find all your starred documents: On the bar above the Docs list, click the
Star button—it's just to the left of the word "Name".
2.8.1.2. Hide a document
You probably have some documents that you don't want to throw in the Trash, but you also don't want them
crowding your Docs list. In that case, hide them. Turn on the checkbox next to any document you want to hide
(you can select more than one), and then click the Hide button. Like magic, the document disappears.
Google tucks it out of the way in the appropriately named Hidden list. To make a hidden file reappear, find All
Items in the left-hand menu (it should be at the top of the list) and, if necessary, click its + sign to expand it.
Then click Hidden to see your hidden files; select the file you want, and then click Unhide. Google moves the
document back to your main Docs list.
2.8.1.3. Create a folder
Just as folders and a filing cabinet keep you from drowning in paper at the office, Google Docs folders keep your
Docs list organized by grouping related documents together. To create a new folder, click the upper-left New
button, and then click Folder. The page changes to look like Figure 2-42. Name your folder and, if you like, fill in
a description. (Descriptions appear above the list of documents in the folder.) You can also assign a color to the

folder, which makes documents belonging to a folder easy to spot in the Docs list. Click "Choose color", and
then pick a color from the box that appears.
Docs adds the folder to the left-hand menu. After you've added some documents to the folder (next section),
click its name in the left-hand menu to see its contents.
You can also create subfolders. In the left-hand menu, click the folder you want to hold
the subfolder; that folder's contents appear in the Docs list. Now, click New
Folder.
Docs creates the new folder inside the folder you chose.
Figure 2-42. In the text box, give your new folder a descriptive name. (If you don't name the folder,
then Docs calls it New Folder.) You can also add a description to the folder or choose a color to label
it by clicking one of the circled links.
2.8.1.4. Put documents in a folder
After you've created a folder, it's ready to store your documents. To do so, comb through the Docs list for the
documents you want to move, and then turn on their checkboxes. Then, in the blue bar above the Docs list,
click "Move to". A box opens with a list of existing folders. Select the folder you want, and then click "Move to
folder".

Docs doesn't really move the file; it's still right there in All Items. Instead, Docs places a link to the file in the
folder. At the same time, it labels the file with the folder's name (Figure 2-43). You can scan the Docs list or
open the relevant folder to find documents in that folder. And since Docs puts a copy of the file in the folder and
not the original, you can store the same document in more than one folder. For example, say you travel a lot,
and you have a folder called Hotels that contains lists of your favorite hotels in different cities. As you plan a trip
to Paris, you create another folder called Paris Trip. You can find your list of Paris hotels in the Hotels folder and
store a copy in the Paris Trip folder, too. Storing the same document in multiple folders can make the document
easier to find—you don't have to wrack your brain trying to remember where you filed it.
Figure 2-43. Documents in folders still appear in All Items in the Docs list, but they have a label
(circled) that shows which folder(s) they're in (also circled).
NOTE
When Docs puts a copy in a folder, it's not a static, unchanging copy. Any changes you make to the
document apply to all copies: the one in All Items of the Docs list and those in any folders. So you never
have to worry about which copy in which folder is the current one—they all are.
2.8.1.5. Change a folder's color
Docs' folder colors work a lot like labels in Gmail ([click here]). When you assign a color to a folder, that color
appears in the Docs list, with the folder's name, on any documents that belong in that folder. So folder colors
can help you find the document you want with a quick glance at the Docs list.

Sometimes, you might want to change a folder's color—red for documents in the folder of a project that's
approaching a deadline, for example. To change a color, in the Docs home page's left-hand menu, click the
folder's name. (You may have to click the + sign next to All Folders to find it.) When you click the folder's name,
the Docs list displays all the documents in that folder. Above the list, click "Choose color". A box displaying
folder colors pops up; click the color you want. You can also choose Docs' default color (green letters on a light-
green background) or "Remove color", which makes the folder label black letters on a gray background.
For a shortcut to picking a folder color, in the left-hand menu, right-click (control-click)
the folder, and then, from the color palette, choose a color.
2.8.1.6. Remove documents from a folder
To take a document out of a folder, in the left-hand menu, click the folder's name to open it. Next, find the
document you want to pluck out, turn on its checkbox, and then select "Move to"
"Remove from current
folder" (it's at the top of the list of folders). Finally, click "Remove from folder"; Docs removes the copy from the
folder and strips off the file's label.
2.8.1.7. Hide or delete a folder
If you use lots of folders, the complete folder list can get pretty long. To hide a folder, right-click (control-click)
it, and then, from the shortcut menu, select Hide. (Even when a folder is hidden, you still see its name in the
Docs list next to any files it holds.)
To delete a folder (but not the files it contains), right-click (control-click) the folder, and then, from the shortcut
menu that appears, select Delete. Docs moves the folder to the Trash, and removes the folder's name from the
files it held (in the Docs list). Those files still appear in All Items in the Docs list, unless you explicitly delete
them.
If you use Firefox and can't see the Docs shortcut menu when you right-click (because
the Firefox menu gets in the way), see the Tip on [click here] to fix the problem.
2.8.2. Searching for Documents
Because this is Google Docs, you know it's got to be good at helping you find what you're looking for. When you
search your Docs list, Google searches titles and body text to find matches.
To perform a search, at the top of the Google Docs home page, use the Search box. When you start typing the
Search box, Google starts searching, as Figure 2-44 shows. Google tries to guess the words you have in mind,
and suggests the most likely match. If Google finds what you're looking for, click the suggestion to open the file.
Otherwise, click the Search Docs button to open a list of all results for your Search term. Click any result to
open the corresponding document in the text editor.
Figure 2-44. Google likes to guess what you're searching for. If it's right, then click the suggestion to
open that document. Otherwise, click Search Docs, and then check the full list of results.

You can also do an advanced search of your documents, which is really handy when you want to narrow down a
long list of search results. To the right of the search box, click "Show search options" to expand the page so it
looks like Figure 2-45. The advanced search options let you specify any combination of these criteria:
Has the words. Search for a word or phrase inside a document. If you know that the document you want
had the word urgent in it, type urgent in this box. When Google searches, it combs through all your
documents in search of that word.
Figure 2-45. Google gives you a lot of options for narrowing down a search. You can also save
your search results. Click "Save this search" (circled right), give the search a name, and Google
adds the search results to the "Saved searches" in the left-hand menu (circled left).

Named. Remember the document's title—or just a word from it? Type it into this box, and Google scans
all your documents' titles to find it.
Type. Tell Google to search all your files, or restrict the search to only documents, spreadsheets,
presentations, or folders.
Search. Google usually searches all items, but you can narrow things down by telling it to search only
documents that you own, starred documents, hidden documents, or those lurking in the Trash.
Search folders. Click this button, and then select a folder if you want to search only within a specific
folder.
Sharing. If you created the document you're looking for and never shared it with anyone, use this list to
search only those documents that are "Private (not shared)". Other options are Any, "Shared by me",
"Shared with me", and Published.
Shared With. Type in a name or email address here. (If you use Gmail, then Google checks your Contacts
list as you type, and tries to guess the person you want.)
Owner is. Start typing, and Google offers suggestions. You can also search for documents you created
and own by typing me in this box.

Date. Your choices here are Modified (when someone last changed the document) or "Opened by me" (if
you recall the last time you looked at it).
Within. Pick a time period from 1 day to 1 year from the choices on the drop-down list, and then give
Google a date to work with. This section might look like this: Within 2 weeks of today or Within 3 days of
March 2, 2008 or Within 1 year of 5/24/09. (Google's good at reading dates, so you have flexibility in the
date format.)
When you've set your search criteria, click Search Docs. Google scours your files and shows the results in the
Docs list.
When you do an advanced search, you can save the results so you don't have to do the
search all over again, which is handy if you frequently need to look at the same group of
documents. Click the "Save this search" link just under the Search Docs button (it's
circled in Figure 2-45), and Google asks you to name the search. Type in a name, and
then click OK. Google saves the search results and adds them to the left-hand menu,
making them easy to find. Just click a saved search's name to see the documents it
found.
Power Users' Clinic: Go Mobile with Google Docs
Way back in the Dark Ages, people used telephones for making phone calls, and that was about it.
Nowadays, when you're not busy using your cellphone to take photos, shoot video clips, or read
text messages, you can use it to access your Google Docs.
First, make sure you've got the right kind of phone. If you've got a BlackBerry or an iPhone, you're
good. But any phone that has a good mobile Web browser will probably work. Because cellphone
technology is improving all the time, the more recent your phone, the more likely it is to work with
Google Docs.
Fire up your phone, and then point its browser to http://docs.google.com/m. Or, if you use Google
Docs through your organization's Google Apps account (Chapter 10), use this address:
https://docs.google.com/a/yourdomain/m (replace yourdomain with your organization's domain
name). This gets you to a mobile version of your Docs list. From the list, you can open documents
and spreadsheets to read. At the time of this writing, you couldn't edit docs using your cellphone,
and you could see your presentations only if you're on an iPhone. (Google's updating its apps all
the time, though, so it never hurts to check back and see if things have changed.)
 

 
Chapter 3. Working with Docs Spreadsheets
Start spreadin' the news: Google Docs spreadsheets let you and up to 50—count 'em, 50—of your colleagues
collaborate on a single spreadsheet simultaneously. It's a great, timesaving way to speed up group projects and
actually get things done.
The program's popularity has been spreading like wildfire. In the first year after its launch in 2006, Google Docs
(originally called Google Docs and Spreadsheets) grew by 84 percent, to more than 1.6 million users—that's a
lot of number crunching! And its growth is sure to continue, thanks to Google's clever, highly addictive invite-
and-share system. When somebody accepts an invitation to view or work on a spreadsheet, that person sees
how easy-to-use, secure, and accessible these spreadsheets are. That's convinced a lot of people to switch to
Google Docs as their primary spreadsheet program.
If you're a spreadsheet maven, you might find Docs spreadsheets a little on the basic side. Right now, for
example, you can't use autofilters like you can in Excel. On the other hand, Docs spreadsheets offer everything
that most people need: You can sort your data in various ways, work with formulas and functions, name cell
ranges, create forms and charts, apply formatting rules, and a whole lot more. Add the bonuses of easy
collaboration and a central location for all your spreadsheets, and Google's take on the spreadsheet is definitely
worth a try.
3.1. Getting Started with Google Docs Spreadsheets
Before you can dive in, you need a Google Account. Chapter 2 has the full story on signing up for Google Docs
([click here]) and getting familiar with the Docs home page ([click here]).
On the Docs home page, shown in Figure 3-1, spreadsheets appear in the Docs list along with documents
(Chapter 2) and presentations (Chapter 4). Click a spreadsheet's name to open it. (If there aren't any
spreadsheets listed, you can create a new one—the next section tells you how.)
Figure 3-1. In the Docs list, the spreadsheet icon (circled) is an easy way to spot which files are
spreadsheets. To display just your spreadsheet files, under the left-hand pane's "Items by type"
section, click Spreadsheet (you may have to click the + sign next to "Items by type" to expand the
section).

Chapter 2 gives a lot of info about organizing ([click here]) and searching ([click here])
your files in Google Docs. The tips there apply to spreadsheets as well as word
processing documents.

3.2. Creating a Spreadsheet
Google Docs makes it easy to either create a brand-new spreadsheet or import an existing one. This section
shows you how to do both, and then covers the basics of entering data and saving your spreadsheet.
3.2.1. Starting from Scratch
Google Docs gives you two ways to create a new spreadsheet:
From the Docs home page. In the blue bar above the Docs list, select New
Spreadsheet. Docs opens
the spreadsheet editor in a new window (Figure 3-2).
From the spreadsheet editor. If you're already working with a spreadsheet and need to start a whole
new one, in the upper left, click File
New. Docs opens a new window with a nice, empty spreadsheet
for you to play with.
Figure 3-2. When you create a new spreadsheet, Docs opens it with the spreadsheet editor's Edit tab
selected. To enter data, click a cell, and then start typing. The toolbar above the spreadsheet offers
common editing and formatting tools. The tabs across the top of the page let you view and work with
the spreadsheet in different ways. The ones on the left—Edit, Sort, Formulas, and Revisions—are all
for working with this spreadsheet. The ones on the right—Discuss, Share, and Publish—are for taking
your spreadsheet public. This chapter explains all your options.

3.2.2. Importing an Existing Spreadsheet
You've probably got some spreadsheets on your computer that you work with regularly. You can easily import
them into Google Docs so you can work on them from any computer with an Internet connection. But first you
need to know about some limitations:
Google Docs can only import spreadsheets in certain file formats:
Excel spreadsheets (.xls)
OpenOffice Calc spreadsheets (.ods)
Text files (.txt)
Comma-separated values (.csv)
Tab-separated values (.tsv)
TSB files (.tsb)
Google Docs also has some size limitations for spreadsheets:
You can import only files that are 1 MB or smaller.
A Google Docs spreadsheet can hold up to 10,000 rows, 256 columns, 100,000 cells, or 40 sheets.
When your spreadsheet reaches one of those limits (whichever comes first), that's it.
A spreadsheet can't have more than 20,000 cells containing formulas.
Your Google Docs account can hold only 1,000 spreadsheets. (If you actively work with more than
that, call the folks at Guinness—you're in the running for some kind of world record.)
3.2.2.1. Import from Excel or another spreadsheet program
If you want to transfer a spreadsheet that lives on your computer into Google Docs, you can do so from the
Google Docs home page or from the spreadsheet editor (shown in Figure 3-2).
From the Docs home page. In the upper left, click the Upload button. On the Upload a File page that
appears, click the Browse button to open a window where you can find the file you want. Select the file,
click Open, and then click Upload File. Docs adds the file to your Docs list, and then opens the file.

From the spreadsheet editor. If you're working on an open spreadsheet, in the upper left of your
screen, select File
Import to open the Import File box. Click Browse to open a window where you can
pinpoint the spreadsheet you want to import. Click the file's name, and then click Open. Docs imports the
file (adding it to your Docs list), and changes the Import File box to look like the one in Figure 3-3. Click
"Open now" if you want to work on the file now. If you'd rather save it for later, click Cancel (you're not
canceling the import—you're just telling Google you don't want to view it right now). Later on you can find
the imported file in the Docs list on your Docs home page ([click here]).
Figure 3-3. When you import a file while you're in the spreadsheet editor, you may or may not want
to work on the new file right away. After Docs imports the file, you can view it by clicking the "Open
now" link (circled). If you don't want to work on it just yet, click Cancel to stay in the current
spreadsheet. The imported file gets added to your Docs list, so you can open it anytime.
The box on [click here] teaches you how to import a spreadsheet into Google Docs, and
add it to an existing Docs spreadsheet as a new sheet ([click here]).
3.2.2.2. Email a spreadsheet to Google Docs
You can email yourself a spreadsheet and have Google add it to your Docs list. This way, you can quickly upload
several spreadsheets at once.
Click the Docs home page's Upload button; the page that opens contains an email address that's unique to your
Docs account. Use this address to send yourself an email with a spreadsheet attached. When Docs gets the
email, it adds the attachment to your Docs list. You can send more than one attachment per email, but Docs
can only handle up to ten attachments at a time, so don't get carried away. (If you need more info on how to
email a file to Google Docs, [click here] has details—just attach a spreadsheet instead of a text document.)

If the spreadsheet you're importing has a chart in it, the chart doesn't import with your
data. Import the spreadsheet, and then recreate the chart in Docs ([click here] tells you
how to turn spreadsheet data into a chart).
3.2.3. Spreadsheet Basics: Entering Data, Selecting Cells, Navigating, and More
A brand-new spreadsheet looks pristine and full of potential, or intimidatingly empty, depending on your point
of view. To start entering data into a cell, just click the cell, and then type. To move rightward, to the next cell
in the row, hit Tab. To move downward, to the next cell in the column, hit Enter (Return). You can also use the
arrow keys to hop from one cell to another.
To select a range of cells, click the cell where you want the range to begin, hold down the Shift key, and then
click the last cell in the range. To select a whole row, click its number on the left side of your screen; to select a
whole column, click its letter at the top of the spreadsheet. And to select the entire spreadsheet, click the blank
square that's above row 1 and to the left of column A.
If you need to enter the same piece of information several times, Docs tries to help you out by guessing what
you're typing. For example, if you enter transportation in a spreadsheet of travel expenses, and then type tra in
a new cell, Docs fills in the rest of the word for you. (Note that this works only for cells that are in the same
column.) If you want Docs to enter transportation in that cell, just hit Enter (Return). If you don't want to
accept what Docs suggests, just keep typing to ignore the suggestion.
As you work on your spreadsheet, you can use the upper-left File button to do lots of useful stuff:
New opens a brand-new spreadsheet in a brand-new window.
Import uploads a file ([click here]) from your computer into Google Docs.
Open brings up a box that displays all your spreadsheets; choose one to open it.
Save lets you name and save a new spreadsheet. (When you create a new spreadsheet, Docs calls it
Unsaved spreadsheet until you give it a different name.) After you've done that, Docs automatically saves
your spreadsheet every 10 minutes. (For more about saving spreadsheets, see [click here].)
Copy spreadsheet creates a new spreadsheet that's an exact copy of the one you're working on. When
you choose this option, Docs opens a box that lets you name and save the new spreadsheet.
Print starts the process of printing the current spreadsheet. This is one of two ways to print—the other is
the upper-right Print link. For more about printing, scoot over to [click here].
Export lets you save a spreadsheet to your computer or open it in an offline spreadsheet program like
Excel, as [click here] explains.

Upload new version imports a version of the same spreadsheet from your computer and replaces the
contents of the current Docs spreadsheet with the new version's data. (See the Tip on [click here].)
Rename gives the current file a new name.
You can also rename an open spreadsheet by clicking its title in the page's upper
left.
Spreadsheet settings lets you change the locale and time zone for the current spreadsheet. (In general,
these settings are the same for your spreadsheets as they are for your Docs account; [click here] walks
you through the Google Docs Settings page.) This ability is handy if you're working on a spreadsheet while
traveling.
Close closes the current spreadsheet. If you've started working on a new spreadsheet and haven't saved
it yet, Docs reminds you to save before you close.
As you can see back in Figure 3-2, the Docs spreadsheet editor has a toolbar at the top that puts various
formatting and data entry tasks at your fingertips. From left to right, here's what's on it:
Undo. Made a mistake? This button erases it.
Redo. If you're having second thoughts about what you just undid with the Undo button, click this button.
Cut. Copies the contents of the selected cells to your clipboard, and removes the content from your
spreadsheet.
Copy. Copies the contents of the selected cells to your clipboard, but leaves the content in your
spreadsheet.
Paste. When you click this button, you can paste values only (the actual info inside the cells), format only
(the way the cells' content is formatted, including stuff like alignment and date or currency formats, minus
the actual content), or both values and content.
To speed up your data entry, use the Google Docs keyboard shortcuts listed in
Appendix A.
Format. Clicking this button gives you a range of options: You can have Docs round up to whole numbers
or show two decimal places for numeric data (whether your spreadsheet contains financial info,
percentages, or plain ol' numbers), choose a currency, pick a format for dates and times, or use plain text
(to treat numbers as text, rather than numeric data). Choose Normal to go back to the default format
([click here] tells you more about formatting data).

Bold.
Italic.
Underline.
Strikethrough.
Font style. You don't have a lot of choices here compared to the options in Excel, but nobody's looking at
your spreadsheet to admire its fancy fonts.
Font size. You can choose from a range of 6 to 36 points.
Text color. You've got 40 to choose from.
Background color. Make a row, column, or cell stand out by colorizing its background.
You can create rules to apply a text or background color automatically under
circumstances you specify—[click here] tells you how.
Borders. You can choose from borders around every cell, no borders at all, and just about everything in
between.
Clear format. If you've made a formatting choice that doesn't look right, undo it with a click of this
button. (Unlike the Undo button, which only undoes your last action, this button works even if you've
made changes to your spreadsheet between now and when you originally applied the formatting.)
Align. Here's where you choose a horizontal or vertical alignment (or both) for the contents of cells.
Insert. Use this button to insert a row above or below the current one. It also lets you insert a chart
([click here]), a comment ([click here]), a gadget ([click here]), or an image ([click here]).
Delete. Here you can choose to delete a specific row or column or clear the contents of the currently
selected cell. You can also delete any comments added to a cell.
Wrap text. Leave this checkbox turned on to make text wrap so it fits the width of the cell it's in; turn it
off to prohibit wrapping. When wrap text is turned off, you see a normal-sized cell, but you have to click
the cell to expand it and read all the text it contains.

Add. This button let you create a chart ([click here]) or a gadget ([click here]) from the spreadsheet's
data.
Merge across. If you want one cell to stretch across several columns (this works well for subheadings, for
example), select the cells, and then click this button to merge them into one. Break up a merged cell by
clicking this button again (its name has changed to "Break apart").
3.2.4. Saving a Spreadsheet in Google Docs
Saving a Docs spreadsheet is a little different from saving a Docs word processing document. When you open a
new spreadsheet, you have to save it manually the first time. After that, Docs takes over with its usual
autosaving every 10 minutes. To make sure you name and save a new spreadsheet, Docs puts up a warning box
when you start entering data, as shown in Figure 3-4.
Figure 3-4. When you create a new spreadsheet, it's up to you to save it the very first time (as Docs
reminds you when you start entering data). You can save a new file by choosing File
Save, or by
clicking one of the upper-right Save buttons (circled).
You have several ways to name and save your new spreadsheet:
Click the left-hand File button, and then choose Save.

Click the upper-right Save button.
If you're done with the file for now, then click the upper-right Save & Close button.
Whichever way you choose, Docs opens a box where you can name the spreadsheet. Enter a name, and then
click OK; Docs saves the spreadsheet with its new name. If you clicked Save & Close, then it also closes the
spreadsheet.
After you've saved a new spreadsheet for the first time, your options for saving change. On both the File menu
and the upper-right Save button, the Save option changes to Automatically Saved and gets grayed out so you
can't click it. This is Google's way of saying, "Leave the saving to me."
Of the three options for saving a new file manually, the only one left is Save & Close. When you've finished
editing a spreadsheet, click this button to save any changes Google hasn't caught yet with an autosave, and go
back to the Docs home page.
Make sure you click Save & Close when you're done working on a spreadsheet. If you
just exit the spreadsheet by closing its window, Google may not save all your changes.
3.2.5. Exporting a Spreadsheet
In Google Docs, exporting a spreadsheet means downloading it to your computer, where you can save it and
work on it in a PC-based program like Excel. When you export a spreadsheet, you can save it in one of these file
formats:
ODS (OpenOffice Calc)
XLS (Microsoft Excel)
CSV (comma-separated values)
HTML (hypertext markup language, used to create most Web pages)
TXT (a text file; tabs separate the values)
PDF (portable document format, compatible with Adobe Reader)
Start by opening the spreadsheet you want to export, and then selecting File
Export. From there, the
process varies a bit, depending on what kind of file you're exporting, as explained in the next three sections.

Thanks to Google Gears, you can view Google spreadsheets even when you're not
connected to the Internet. See [click here] to learn about Google Gears.
3.2.5.1. Export a spreadsheet to Excel or OpenOffice Calc
When you export to either the OpenOffice Calc or Excel formats, you can either open the file right away or save
it to work on later. Here's how:
After you've opened the file and clicked File
Export, choose either .ods (for Calc) or .xls (for Excel) as
the file type.
Your Web browser asks how you want to handle this file: Save it to your computer or open it with the
appropriate program.
1.
Make your selection, and then click OK.
Your computer downloads the spreadsheet and either saves it or opens it, depending on your choice.
After you've done some offline editing of the spreadsheet, you can import your
revisions back into Google Docs by uploading the revised copy. Open the Docs
spreadsheet you want to update, and then select File
"Upload new version".
Find the updated file, and then upload it into Google Docs.
2.
3.2.5.2. Export a spreadsheet as a CSV, HTML, or text file
When you export a file in one of these formats, Docs converts the file, and then opens it in a new browser
window. From there, you can use your Web browser's File menu to save the file and reopen it in your
spreadsheet program. Nearly all spreadsheet and database programs understand the CSV format, making it a
handy way to get your data out of Docs.
NOTE
When you export as a CSV, HTML, or TXT file, you export only the current sheet—Docs can't export
multiple sheets in these formats. If you need to export multiple sheets into one file, you have to export
them separately, and then copy and paste each sheet into a single document.
3.2.5.3. Export as a PDF
PDF, which stands for portable document format, preserves a document's formatting and lets people view or
print it on nearly any computer that's running today (Windows, Mac, Linux, whatever). When you select File
Export
.pdf, Docs opens the box shown in Figure 3-5, which is where you make decisions about how the PDF

will look:
Figure 3-5. Here's where you tell Docs how to format the PDF you're about to export. If you select
"Fit to width", Google shrinks your spreadsheet if necessary to make sure it fits across the page.
What parts? Tell Docs whether to convert just the currently open sheet or all the sheets (if the
spreadsheet has more than one sheet).
How big? Do you want to adjust the spreadsheet to fit the page (which can scrunch down the sheet and
make it hard to read) or leave it actual size?
Repeat row headers on each page. Turn on this checkbox if your spreadsheet occupies several printed
pages—this way viewers will know what the data in each column refers to.
Which way? Choose landscape (horizontal orientation) or portrait (vertical orientation).
What paper size? Your choices here are letter (8.5" x 11"), legal (8.5" x 14"), or A4 (210 mm x 297

mm).
After you've chosen your settings, click Export. Google converts the file to a PDF, and opens a window asking
whether you want to save or open the PDF. Make your choice, and then click OK to export the PDF.
 

 
3.3. Formatting a Spreadsheet
When a spreadsheet is nothing but a gaping expanse of rows and columns, it can be tough to read. With a few
quick formatting tricks, though, you can snazz up your spreadsheet, making it easier on the eyes—and its data
easier to read.
3.3.1. Format Text
To format text, select the cell or range of cells to which you want to apply formatting (see [click here] for tips
on selecting ranges of cells), and then choose a formatting option from the Edit toolbar ([click here] explains
what the various toolbar buttons do).
3.3.2. Format Numbers
When you start a new spreadsheet, all cells use the Normal format—which treats numbers as just plain
numbers, not percentages or currencies or anything special—until you tell Google Docs to use some other kind
of formatting. If you've got a column holding a particular kind of numeric data, such as dollar amounts or
percentages, then you can tell Docs to give those numbers dollar signs or percent symbols. You can also specify
whether you want numbers to show decimal places, or you can round your figures to whole numbers.
You can also change numbers from one numeric format to another. For example, if a column contains decimals
(.10, .05, .74, 1.26, and so on) and you think those numbers would be easier to understand as percentages,
select the column, and then click Format
Percent. The numbers change to 10%, 5%, 74%, 126%. Pretty
nifty.
To format all the numbers in a column, select the column you want by clicking the letter cell at the top of the
column (A, B, C, and so on), and then click the Format button. The top part of its menu gives you the formatting
options shown in Table 3-1 (date formatting is explained in the next section).
Table 3-1. Numeric Formats in Spreadsheets
Format
Example
Rounded
1,500
2 Decimals
1,500.00
Financial rounded
(1,500)
Financial
(1,500.00)
Currency rounded
$1,500
Currency
$1,500.00
Percent rounded
99%
Percent
99.00%

To change from dollars to another currency, select the cells you want to format, and
then click Format
"More currencies" to choose from a whole treasure chest of
currencies: euro, pound, yuan, zloty, ruble, baht, peso, rupee—more than two dozen in
all. In the unlikely event that your currency isn't on the list, you can add it. Type it into
the list's "Another currency" box, and then click OK.
3.3.3. Format Dates and Times
Organizations can be pretty picky about how to format dates. Should it be mm/dd/yyyy or dd/mm/yy? Or does
it have to be spelled out, like this: August 24, 2008? Maybe dates and times need to go together. And do you
run on a 12-hour clock (4:15 P.M.) or a 24-hour clock (16:15)?
However you want to format dates and times, Docs can do it. When you select a cell or range of cells and click
the Format button, the bottom part of its menu shows three common date formatting options. But if those won't
do, click "More formats". Another menu flies out, giving you even more choices. You're sure to find one you can
work with.
3.3.4. Create and Apply Formatting Rules
Formatting is great, but who wants to take the time to apply it row by row or column by column? Luckily, you
don't have to. Instead, you can create formatting rules that Docs applies to cells or cell ranges that meet the
criteria you specify. Formatting rules let you change the text and/or background color of a cell (or range of cells)
automatically.
For example, say you're managing a project and you create a spreadsheet to assign and track tasks. You might
organize the spreadsheet with a section headed by each team member's name, followed by their assigned
tasks, and highlight those section headings to make it easy to check out a particular person's responsibilities.
Then, to make sure everyone's paying attention to deadlines, you could format columns containing dates with
an eye-catching color. Whatever you want to call attention to, formatting rules help you do that—automatically.
To create a formatting rule, open the spreadsheet where you want to apply the rule, and then follow these
steps:
Select the cell or range of cells you want to format. (If you want to apply formatting rules to the whole
spreadsheet, click inside the box above row 1 and to the left of column A.) Click either the Text color or
the Background color button (it doesn't matter which), and then turn on the "Change with rules"
checkbox.
Docs opens the "Change colors based on rules" box shown in Figure 3-6.
1.
Figure 3-6. The drop-down menus on the left let you choose the different triggers for the rules,
which can be based on text, whether a cell is empty, dates, or numeric data. Select a trigger, such as
"Text contains" or "Date is after", and then specify the criteria. Here, the rules apply to text
containing the word phase (case doesn't matter) and dates later than today. To create another rule,
click the "Add another rule" link (circled). To delete a rule, click the X to its far right.

Create a rule. Rules follow this syntax: When a cell's contents do/do not meet a specific criterion, apply/do
not apply this text color and/or background color. Here are a couple of examples of how that might play
out in real life: "When text in a cell contains the word phase, give the cell a dark blue background and
yellow lettering." Or "When a cell contains a date after today's date, show that date in red." If you want to
create another rule, click the "Add another rule" link, and the box expands so you can do just that (for up
to five rules total). When you're all set, click the "Save rules" button.
Docs applies the rules you created. Now, when you enter data that meets a rule's criteria, Docs applies
the rule's formatting automatically.
0.
A few things to keep in mind about formatting rules:
Formatting rules apply only to the range of cells you selected. If you add rows or columns later, you have
to specifically apply the rules to those new cell ranges. (You do this by either selecting the new cells and
recreating the rule used elsewhere, or selecting the original cells and the new ones, and then turning the
"Change with rules" checkbox [see step 1 above] off, then back on, and then clicking the "Save rules"
button.)
If you copy a range of cells, and then paste them elsewhere in the same spreadsheet, the formatting
travels with them—Docs applies the formatting rules to the pasted cells. If, however, you paste those cells
into a new spreadsheet, your formatting rules don't apply (you have to create fresh rules for each new
spreadsheet).
You can have up to five formatting rules for one spreadsheet.

If you create more than one formatting rule, Docs applies them in the order you created them (in other
words, it gives priority to the top one in the list).
 

 
3.4. Adding and Deleting Rows and Columns
Spreadsheets have a tendency to get bigger and bigger (maybe that's why they call them spreadsheets). If your
data is growing and you need more cells to contain it, you've got a couple of different ways to add new rows or
columns. First, select a row or column that will be next to the new row or column. To select, click the row's
number on the left of the column's letter at the top of your spreadsheet. Then, either right-click (control-click)
or on the toolbar, click Insert. If you selected a row, then you can insert a new row above or below the selected
one. If you selected a column, then you can insert the new column to its left or right.
Want to add multiple rows or columns? Select the number of rows or columns you want to add (by holding down
the Shift key as you click the rows or columns), and then right-click (control-click) or click the Insert button and
make your choice from the menu; Docs inserts a group of blank rows or columns identical to the number you
selected. So if you need to add 10 new rows to the bottom of your spreadsheet, select the last 10 rows, right-
click (control-click) or click Insert, and select "10 rows below".
To double the size of your spreadsheet, select the whole thing by clicking in the square
that's above row 1 and to the left of column A, and then click Insert. If your spreadsheet
is 100 rows long and 15 columns wide, for example, the Insert menu has options for
adding 100 new rows or 15 new columns.
3.4.1. Move Rows or Columns
You can move rows or columns by cutting and pasting them, but Docs has a faster, easier way. To move a row
or column (or any cell or range of cells, for that matter), first select what you want to move. Then, move your
cursor to an edge of the selection so that it changes to a pointing hand. Drag the cells to their new location.
Release the mouse button, and the cells jump from their old location to their new home. Easy, huh?
When you're moving a row or column, make sure there's a place to move it to: Create
an empty row or column first. Otherwise, you may lose data. If you move, say, a row on
top of an existing row, then Docs pastes the moved data over what was already there.
3.4.2. Hide a Row or Column
A Google Docs spreadsheet can hold up to 100,000 cells—that's a lot of data. And you probably won't need to
display it all at once. Or maybe you want to print out the part of a spreadsheet that lists employee names, job
titles, and phone extensions, but not sensitive info like Social Security numbers and salaries. You can easily hide
any rows or columns that you don't want showing in the spreadsheet.
To hide a row or column, just select the one you want, and then right-click (control-click) to bring up the
shortcut menu. From there, select "Hide row" or "Hide column", as appropriate. Docs hides the row or column,
making your spreadsheet look like the example in Figure 3-7. You can hide a whole range of rows or columns all
at once by selecting several by Shift-clicking each one.
Figure 3-7. When you hide rows or columns, small tabs appear (circled) to show that something isn't

on display. In this example, column F is hidden and so are rows 8 and 15. To bring a hidden row or
column out of hiding, just click its tab.
3.4.3. Delete Rows or Columns
To get rid of a row or column, select it, either right-click (control-click) or click Delete in the toolbar, and then,
from the menu that appears, choose what you want to delete. Docs deletes the row or column and all its
contents.
NOTE
If you want to clear a row or column—which gets rid of the cells' data but leaves the row or column in
place—you can do so by right-clicking (control-clicking) or by clicking the Delete button in the toolbar.
Then, choose Clear instead of Delete.

 

 
3.5. Working with Multiple Sheets
Often, you have related data in separate spreadsheets that you want to keep together in one file. For example,
if you plan a lot of events, you might have one spreadsheet for venues, one for caterers, and another for
entertainment. It would be chaos to try to mix these together into a single spreadsheet, but it would be great to
keep a spreadsheet for each category in the same file.
You can keep all these spreadsheets together in the same file using sheets, which let you stack spreadsheets on
top of each other so you can hop between them without opening a new file. With just one click, you can add a
new sheet to an existing spreadsheet. With the spreadsheet open, click the lower-left Add Sheet button, shown
in Figure 3-8. Docs creates and opens the new sheet. Below the sheet in the lower left are links where you can
click back and forth between sheets. The current sheet displays as a button with a drop-down arrow. Click it to
choose among these options:
Delete
Duplicate
Rename
Move left/right
Sheets start out with names like "Sheet 1" and "Sheet 2," so it's a good idea to give them descriptive names
using the Rename option. The Move option lets you change a sheets place in the stack of spreadsheets.
Figure 3-8. The Add Sheet button does just what it promises—adds and opens a new sheet to your
spreadsheet. When a sheet is open, click the down arrow next to its name to choose one of the
options shown here: delete, duplicate, rename, or move.

When you add new sheets to an existing spreadsheet, you probably want the
newcomers to have the same formatting as the original. Here's how to make that
happen: Click the name of the current sheet in the lower left, and then select Duplicate.
This creates an exact copy of the original sheet. Rename the copy, select all its cells
(click the square above row 1 and to the left of column A), and then clear the data by
selecting Delete
"Clear selection". The data disappears, but the formatting remains.

Frequently Asked Question: Importing New Sheets
How do I add an Excel spreadsheet to an existing Docs spreadsheet?
If you've got an existing Google Docs spreadsheet, you can import another spreadsheet and tack it
onto your Docs spreadsheet as a new sheet. Say you've been tracking on-the-road business
expenses in Google Docs (a great idea, since Docs is so accessible). At home on your personal
computer, you have a different spreadsheet that tracks non-travel business expenses in Excel. To
make things easier at tax time, you want all that info in one big Docs spreadsheet, with one sheet
named Travel Expenses and a second named Other Expenses.
You can't import a spreadsheet from your computer directly into a Google Docs spreadsheet as a
new sheet, but you can get the same result by following these steps:
Open the Google Docs spreadsheet that will hold the imported info. Then click File
Import
to upload the new spreadsheet into Google Docs ([click here]). Find the file you want to
upload, and then click "Open now".
Docs opens the imported file in a new window.
1.
In the imported spreadsheet, select its contents. (Click in the top-left cell, and then, while
holding down the Shift key, click in the bottom-right cell. You can also select the whole sheet
by clicking in the upper-left box that's above the 1 and to the left of the A.) Right-click
(control-click), and then, from the pop-up menu, select Copy.
Docs copies your selection.
2.
Go back to the widow with the spreadsheet where you want to add the copied info, and then
click the bottom-left "Add sheet" button.
Docs adds a new sheet and opens it.
3.
Click cell A1 (the upper-left cell) to put the cursor there. Right-click (control-click), and then,
from the pop-up menu, select Paste.
Voilà! Docs adds the info you imported to the new sheet.
4.
From there, you can give the new sheet a name ([click here]), and delete the imported
spreadsheet ([click here])—you've got its data where you want it, so you don't need a whole extra
spreadsheet hanging around.
NOTE
No matter how much work you have to do, you can't have more than 11 spreadsheets open at once in

Google Docs. (This number doesn't include sheets—[click here]—just individual spreadsheet files.)
 

 
3.6. Adjusting Cell Sizes
If you've ever squinted at a jam-packed spreadsheet, you know that adjusting the height of a row or the width
of a column can make the spreadsheet a whole lot easier to read. To do this in Docs, move your cursor to the
part of the spreadsheet that labels the columns or rows—the light blue area just above or to the left of the
spreadsheet's cells. Place your cursor on the border between two columns or rows. A thick bar appears on the
border, and the cursor changes to a double-headed arrow, as shown in Figure 3-9. Now you can drag to adjust
the position of the border (and with it the size of the row or column). If you double-click while the cursor is a
thick bar, the row or column automatically resizes to fit the longest entry in that selected row or column.
To resize all the rows or columns in a sheet, select the entire sheet, and then resize.
Figure 3-9. When you position your cursor as shown here (circled), you can resize rows or in your
spreadsheet. Move it to the top of your spreadsheet to resize columns.
 

 
3.7. Timesaving Data Entry Tricks
There's a lot more to working with spreadsheets than typing in a cell, hitting Tab, and then typing in the next
cell. The following sections show you different ways to work with data more efficiently.
3.7.1. Auto-Fill
Entering data in a spreadsheet can get repetitive. Auto-Fill cuts down on the drudgery with one-click copying
and pasting, so you don't have to type the same content over and over a million times. For example, imagine
you use a spreadsheet to schedule employees' hours, one sheet per month. When a new week rolls around, you
don't want to have to type in everyone's name in column A all over again. That's where Auto-Fill comes in. Auto-
Fill lets you select a range of cells, and pop their content right into a group of adjacent cells. Here's how:
Select the range of cells whose contents you want to copy. For example, in the employees' name example,
you'd copy everyone's name.
As Figure 3-10 shows, a teensy blue box appears in the selection range's lower-right corner.
Figure 3-10. The shaded area in column A is the area selected as the Auto-Fill source.
Click and drag the little box in its lower-right corner (circled) to where you want to copy
the selected text, as indicated by the dotted line.
1.

Position your cursor over the little blue box, so the cursor turns into crosshairs. Then, drag the selection
box to encompass the cells you want to Auto-Fill. When you've expanded the selection box to whatever
size you want to fill in, let go of the mouse button.
Docs fills the blank cells with the text you selected, in the same order as the original. If you selected fewer
cells than are in the range whose contents you copied, Docs fills in as many new cells as you selected, and
leaves off any Auto-Fill text that it doesn't have room for. If you selected more cells than the original
range, Docs fills in the Auto-Fill text from beginning to end, and then starts over again.
2.
You can Auto-Fill cell ranges adjacent to the cells in your selection range—above, below, to the left, or to the
right—but you can't use Auto-Fill to skip over cells.
If Google recognizes a pattern in the cells you're copying, it completes the pattern
automatically. For example, if you want to Auto-Fill 3 years' worth of months down
column A, then you don't have to type in the names of all 12 months before you can
Auto-Fill. Type enough to make the pattern recognizable, such as January in A1,
February in A2, and March in A3. Select those 3 months for Auto-Filling (so the little
blue box appears in the March cell's bottom-right corner), and then stretch the Auto-Fill
area down to A36. Docs fills in 3 years' worth of months—not just those you typed but
also April, May, June, and so on—all the way down the column.
3.7.2. Copy Data
Auto-Fill is a super-simple way to copy data from one range of cells to an adjacent range. But if you want to
copy a range of cells and paste their data somewhere else—a new sheet, a different spreadsheet, a non-
adjacent section of this spreadsheet, whatever—copying data is almost as easy: Select the range of cells you
want to copy, and then right-click (control-click) to bring up a menu. Select Copy, and then go to the sheet or
location where you want the copied cells to appear. Select a range the same size as you copied from (for
example, if you copied five rows by three columns, select five rows and three columns in the new location).
Right-click (control-click), and then from the context menu, select Paste. Docs pastes in your data.
Here are three other ways to copy data:
Copy from one cell to multiple adjacent cells. Select the cell that holds the content you want to copy.
Then select the range of cells that you want to copy the content to. (To select the cells, hold down the
Shift key while using the down and right arrow keys to determine the size of the range.) After you've
selected the target range, press Ctrl+D (
-D) to copy down or Ctrl+R (
-R) to copy right. You can only
use this trick to copy down or to the right, but if you copy down and then to the right (or vice versa), you
can fill in a large range of cells with just a couple keystrokes.
Copy a sheet within an existing spreadsheet file. Find the sheet you want to copy. In the bottom part
of the page, click the down arrow next to the current sheet's name. From the menu that pops up, select
Duplicate. Docs copies the sheet and inserts it, with the name "Copy of [current sheet's name]", into your
spreadsheet.
Copy an existing spreadsheet to create a new one. This one's simple. Open the spreadsheet you
want to copy, and then select File
"Copy spreadsheet". Docs opens a box where you can name the

copy. Name it, and then click OK. Docs opens the new copy, and adds it to the Docs list on your Docs
home page.
NOTE
If the spreadsheet you're copying has multiple sheets, then the new copy has those sheets, too.
3.7.3. Clear Data
When you want to delete data—whether it's the contents of one cell or of an entire spreadsheet—select the
range of cells whose data you want to flush. Then right-click (control-click) or, on the toolbar, click Delete, and
then choose "Clear selection". Docs zaps the contents of all the cells in the range.
NOTE
Clearing the contents of cells doesn't get rid of their formatting. To unformat a cell or range of cells, on
the toolbar, click the "Clear format" button.
3.7.4. Summing Up a List of Numbers
When you've got a long column filled with numbers, you really need the ability to add all or some of them
quickly. Google Docs has a Quick Sum feature that lets you do just that.
To add up the contents of a column, select a range of cells. Quick Sum adds up their contents and displays the
total in the spreadsheet's lower-right corner, as shown in Figure 3-11. Click the sum to see more info about the
numbers in the selected range.
Figure 3-11. Quick Sum adds the numbers you select, displaying the total in the lower-right corner of
the spreadsheet. Click the sum to see more about the selected range, including its average, count
(how many numbers are in the range), and smallest and largest numbers.

NOTE
Quick Sum doesn't just work on individual columns or rows. You can select a larger range of cells—say
10 rows and three columns—and Quick Sum works its magic on the whole range.

Workaround Workshop: When Quick Sum Won't Sum
If Quick Sum doesn't add up the numbers you selected, the first thing to check is how many cells
you're trying to add. Quick Sum doesn't work on more than 1,000 cells.
If that's not the problem, you may need to tinker with your spreadsheet's settings. Quick Sum
works most reliably when the spreadsheet's location is set to the United States. If your locale is
something other than the U.S. (or if you're not sure what country the spreadsheet is set to), then
click File
"Spreadsheet settings". In the Spreadsheet Settings box, check the drop-down menu
under Locale. If it says anything besides United States, click the arrow and choose United States
from the list. Changing the locale for a particular spreadsheet doesn't affect the settings of other
spreadsheets in Google Docs or of your Google Account ([click here]).
Still have trouble getting Quick Sum to work? If the numbers you're trying to add are currency
amounts, select the column, and then click Format
"More currencies"
dollar, and then try
Quick Sum again. If it's still not working, you're probably using a language other than English to
interact with Google Docs. Go to the upper-right part of the spreadsheet, and then click Docs
Home
Settings. On the Settings page's General tab ([click here]), change the language to
English (US).
Quick Sum works based on your location, and Google began by making it work for people in the
U.S. But Google realizes that people all over the world use spreadsheets, and they're improving
Docs all the time, rolling out Quick Sum for other locations as well. If Quick Sum doesn't work
right for your locale, it should before long. In the meantime, try this workaround.
 

 
3.8. Checking Your Spelling
Unlike the Docs text editor, the spreadsheet editor doesn't have built-in spell checking. But you have a couple of
ways to check the spelling of the words in your spreadsheet. If you use Firefox as your Web browser, Firefox 2
and later has a built-in spell checker. To turn it on (if it's not already), open Firefox for Windows, click Tools
Options
Advanced, and then click the General tab. If you're using a Mac, click Firefox
Preferences
Advanced. In the Browsing section, turn on the checkbox labeled "Check my spelling as I type", and then click
OK. With spell checking turned on, Firefox puts a dotted red line under words it doesn't recognize as you type in
your spreadsheet. (Once you move to a different cell, you don't see an underline even if a word is spelled
wrong—Firefox checks spelling only while you're typing in a cell.)
Download or upgrade to the latest version of Firefox at www.firefox.com.
If you've installed the Google Toolbar ([click here]), then you can use that to check your spelling in Google Docs
spreadsheets; a spell check button comes with the standard buttons. The Toolbar's spell checker doesn't check
your spelling as you type (which can be kind of distracting, anyway), but one click checks spelling throughout
your spreadsheet.
 

 
3.9. Inserting Images
When you import a spreadsheet into Google Docs ([click here]), any charts contained in the spreadsheet don't
join your data for the import ride. Bummer. But you can use a workaround (though it's clumsy): To get charts
into Docs, you have to save each chart as an image, and then insert the image into your spreadsheet. More
encouragingly, you can also insert other kinds of images, such as a company logo or photos of your toddler as
you update her height and weight.
Before you insert an image into a Docs spreadsheet, you should know a few things:
The image has to live somewhere on the Web. Docs needs a Web address for any image it inserts
into a spreadsheet. If it can't find it on the Web, it can't display the image—so you can't insert images that
are saved only on your computer.
You can easily store images on the Web by opening a free account with a photo-
sharing site such as Flickr, Snapfish, Photobucket, or Google's own Picasa Web
Albums. When you upload an image file (it doesn't have to be a photo) to one of
these sites, the site stores the image for you and gives it a unique URL, which you
can copy and use to insert the image into a Google spreadsheet or other Google
doc.
There's a size limit. The image can't be bigger than 500 pixels in width or height. If yours is bigger than
that, edit it to make it smaller before you try to insert it.
You can't insert an image just anywhere. If you've frozen some rows or columns in your spreadsheet
([click here]), you can't insert the image into the frozen section.
Once you've got the Web address for the image you want to upload, you're ready to insert it into a spreadsheet.
Just follow these steps:
Open the spreadsheet into which you want to insert the image. Then, on the toolbar, click Insert
Image.
Docs opens the box shown in Figure 3-12.
Figure 3-12. Docs can't insert images stored on your computer—you have to give it the
image's Web address.
1.

Tell Docs where to find the image by putting its Web address in the text box. The easiest way is to open
the image in another browser window, copy its URL, and then, back in Docs, paste the URL into the text
box.
2.
Click OK.
Docs inserts the image into your spreadsheet.
3.
3.9.1. Edit or Resize an Image
Once you've got an image in your spreadsheet, you can work with it in various ways. Click the image to bring up
the Image menu, shown in Figure 3-13. When the word "Image" appears in the upper-left corner of your image,
you can click and drag it to move it in your spreadsheet. You can resize the image by positioning your cursor on
a border so it becomes a double-headed arrow, and then dragging to make the image larger or smaller. If you
don't like the new size, click the Image menu, and then select "Reset size" to return it to its original size.
Figure 3-13. After you've inserted an image into a spreadsheet, click the image to bring up the
upper-left Image menu, which has the options shown here.

If you've edited the chart outside of Docs (in Excel, say) and want to replace it, then click Image
"Edit
image" to open the Insert Image box shown in Figure 3-12. From there, you can upload the edited image to
replace the current one.
3.9.2. Delete an Image
If an image becomes obsolete or just doesn't work out as part of your spreadsheet, click the image so that the
upper-left Image menu appears. Click Image
Delete Image, and the image disappears. (You can click Undo
to get it back.)
 

 
3.10. Sorting Data
Data doesn't necessarily march into your spreadsheet in a nice, orderly fashion; you have to input data as it
arrives. As your spreadsheet grows, the rows can seem disorganized, making it difficult to spot trends or find a
particular piece of data. Sorting lets you organize the spreadsheet in different ways, whether you want to find
out which of your customers live in Chicago, who's spending the most money on business trips, or all the Mozart
CDs in your collection.
Google Docs offers two ways of sorting a spreadsheet's data: the Sort tab and the Sortbar.
3.10.1. Use the Sort Tab
When you enter and edit data on a spreadsheet, you do all that on the Edit tab. Sitting right next to it, in the
left part of your screen, is the Sort tab. When you click Sort, the toolbar above the spreadsheet changes to the
one shown in Figure 3-14.
Figure 3-14. The toolbar on the Sort tab (circled) lets you display a spreadsheet's data in various
ways. In this spreadsheet, which catalogs a book collection, Docs is about to sort the data based on
column E (Value) from most valuable to least valuable (that's descending, or Z
A, order).
Here's what's on the Sort tab's toolbar:
Sort sheet by column [x]. This is informational rather than an action item. This text tells you which
column will be the basis for the sort. Select a different column, and the letter here changes.

Sort alphabetically from A to Z. Puts things into nice, neat A-B-C order or 1-2-3 order, depending on
the contents of the column you've chosen for the sort. (Numerical data sorts from lowest to highest
number.)
Sort alphabetically from Z to A. Helpful when you want to find, for example, Martin Yzringa out of
several thousand names or the priciest item in a price list (it'll appear at the top).
Freeze header rows. Keeps your headers from being sorted with everything else in the spreadsheet. For
example, if the first row of your spreadsheet contains headings that name each column—such as Name,
Address, City, State, and so on—you don't want that row ending up in the middle of the N's in your sort.
Freeze the first row to keep that from happening. (You can freeze up to five rows using this button.)
Freeze columns. Keeps the leftmost column or columns—you can freeze up to five—from being part of
the sort.
When you freeze a row or column, you tell Docs not to move it around in the sort. Frozen rows and columns get
set off from the rest of the data in the spreadsheet, as Figure 3-15 shows.
Need to freeze more than five rows? The next section clues you in on how to use the
Sortbar to freeze up to 10.
Figure 3-15. The top row and leftmost column of this spreadsheet are frozen—you can tell because
they're separated from the rest of the spreadsheet by gray dividers. When you scroll through a
spreadsheet, frozen rows and columns don't move.

3.10.2. Use the Sortbar
The Sortbar lives at the top of your spreadsheet and lets you do a quick sort without leaving the Edit tab. Open
a spreadsheet in the Edit tab, and then click anywhere inside the light blue box at the top of a column (the box
that holds the letter that labels the column). Then move the cursor down just a bit until it's pointing at the bar
separating the label box from the first row of cells—this is the Sortbar. Hovering your cursor over the Sortbar
"wakes it up," as shown in Figure 3-16, and turns it orange. Click the arrow on the right side of the Sortbar, and
then choose whether you want an ascending or descending sort. Docs sorts your column accordingly.
Figure 3-16. The Sortbar (which the cursor is pointing to here) lets you sort while you're on the Edit
tab.

If you're just using the Sortbar for a quick sort, click the Undo button to restore the
previous, unsorted order.
You can also use the Sortbar to freeze several rows without leaving the Edit tab. At the extreme left end of the
Sortbar is a shaded box with diagonal lines on it, shown in Figure 3-17. When you put your cursor over the box,
the cursor changes to a four-way arrow (if you're using Firefox on a Mac, it changes to a grasping hand). Drag
the Sortbar to place it between two rows. Now, when you use the Sortbar, it sorts only the rows beneath it,
leaving any rows above it alone. You can position the Sortbar anywhere between rows 1 and 11.
Figure 3-17. To move the Sortbar, drag the box at the left end of the Sortbar (circled with four-way
arrow cursor). There's no vertical Sortbar, but you can freeze columns by dragging the shaded gray
box at the border of the leftmost sortable column (also circled). You can freeze up to five columns
this way.

 

 
3.11. Formulas and Functions
The data in your spreadsheet won't do you much good if it just sits there. If you've got a column of numbers,
for example, you probably want to work with those numbers in some way: Add 'em up, find their average, find a
percentage to figure sales tax, or make other calculations. In a Docs spreadsheet, you make those calculations
using formulas. (Actually, once you've written a formula, you don't make the calculation—the spreadsheet
makes it for you. Nice!) Formulas tell the spreadsheet what operation to perform on a specific set of data. This
section teaches you all about formulas and how to use them.
3.11.1. Formula Basics
Here's a simple example of a spreadsheet formula (you insert a formula into a cell in your spreadsheet). If you
want to write a formula to add cells B2 and B3, it would look like this:
=B2+B3
Take a look at the parts of that formula:
The equal sign (=) marks the beginning of the formula, letting Docs know: "Hey! This cell holds a formula
and not regular text or numbers."
The cell identifiers B2 and B3 tell Docs which cells to work with.
NOTE
Cell identifiers are like street addresses—they help you find specific cells. If you see the cell
identifier F4, that's pointing to the data in the fourth cell down in column F.
The operator (in this case, the + sign) tells Docs what to do with those cells.
Although formulas can get pretty complicated, all formulas build on these basic elements.
NOTE
You can also use numbers in formulas, not just cell identifiers. For example, =E20*2 tells Google to
multiply the contents of cell E20 by 2.

If you're fluent in spreadsheet-ese, you can write formulas from scratch using the mathematical operators
shown in Table 3-2.
Table 3-2. Mathematical Operators You Can Use in Google Docs Spreadsheets
Operator What It Does
+
Addition
–
Subtraction

>

<

^
Exponentiation (raised to the power of)
You can also use advanced formulas, called functions (which are built right into Google Docs), as building blocks
for formulas. How's a function different from a regular formula? Well, in a function you supply the values, but
the function supplies the operators. In other words, the function tells your spreadsheet what to do; you just tell
it what data to work with. Functions range from the basic (Sum to add a column of numbers) to the ridiculously
complex (Google Finance, which looks up current stock prices).
To start working with formulas, click the Formulas tab, shown in Figure 3-18. Once there, click an empty cell;
this cell will hold your formula and display its result. Select a function from the upper-right part of the page. If
you don't see the function you want, click "more" and look for it in the "Insert a Function" box, shown in Figure
3-19.
Figure 3-18. Not surprisingly, the Formulas tab (circled) is where you create formulas to use in a
spreadsheet. Common functions appear as links on the right side of the page (circled). Click "more"
to browse through a longer list of functions.

The functions in the "more" menu show functions' names, but no description of what
each function does. To find out, on the right side of the "Insert a Function" box, click a
function to select it, and then, in the box's lower-right corner, click the "more" link. In a
new window, Google opens a page that describes what the function does. (For a
comprehensive list of functions and what they do, go to
www.docs.google.com/support/spreadsheets, and then click Advanced Editing
Functions.)
Figure 3-19. Docs has dozens of functions you can use to create your formulas. From the left side of
the box, choose a category, such as Math or Text, and the right side changes to show you all the
functions in that category. Click a function to insert it in your cell and build your formula.

When you select a function, Google inserts it into the cell where you're building your formula. The function tells
Docs what to do; now you just have to tell Docs which data to use. Say you want the formula to find the
average of a particular cell range: E2 through E45. On the Formulas tab, select Average, and then Docs inserts
this function into the cell:
=Average(
From here, your job is to tell Docs which cells you want it to find the average of. To do that, type the identifier
of the first cell in the range, then a colon, and then the identifier of the last cell followed by a close parenthesis
(to show that you're done writing your formula). Your formula now looks like this:
=Average(E2:E45)
When you hit Enter (Return), Docs averages the contents of cells E2 through E45, and then shows the result in
the cell where you entered the formula.
To make your formulas easier to write, use range names ([click here]) in place of cell
ranges.

3.11.2. The GoogleLookup function
Google being Google, it wants to help you find the info you need as you work on your spreadsheet. In fact, you
don't even need to leave your spreadsheet to look things up. The GoogleLookup function lets you write a
formula that retrieves information from the Web and pops it right into your spreadsheet. Here's the basic
formula:
=GoogleLookup("entity"; "attribute")
Replace the word entity with what you want to look up, and attribute with what you want to find out about it.
Here are some examples (note the quotation marks around the entity and the attribute, and the space after the
semi-colon):
=GoogleLookup("London"; "population")
=GoogleLookup("Giuseppe Verdi"; "birth date")
=GoogleLookup("Alabama"; "capital")
These formulas ask:
What's the population of London?
On what date was Giuseppe Verdi born?
What's the capital of Alabama?
For these formulas, Google returns 7.5 million (2005), 9-Oct-1813, and Montgomery, respectively. Google also
inserts a comment ([click here]) telling you where it got its information. The comment includes a link so you can
check out the source for yourself (always a good idea).
The GoogleLookup function can fetch a lot of info, but it's not all-knowing. If it can't find what you're looking for,
it returns "#N/A" to let you know it drew a blank. Still, it's fun to play with, whether you need some info or you
just want to see if you're smarter than a Google function.
NOTE
You can insert a maximum of 250 GoogleLookups into a single spreadsheet. And, for the moment
anyway, the GoogleLookup function works only in English.

3.11.3. The GoogleFinance function
Another cool feature of Docs spreadsheets is the GoogleFinance function, which looks up stock market quotes
and other financial info, and slots it right into your spreadsheet. If you want to track your stock portfolio, this is
a great way to do it. Create a spreadsheet that lists your stocks in one column and inserts the function in
another, and Google automatically updates the stocks' current values every minute or so. It's like having your
own personalized stock ticker on your desktop.
Here's what the GoogleFinance function looks like:
=GoogleFinance("symbol"; "attribute")
To make this function work, replace symbol with an actual stock symbol, and attribute with the type of
information you want about that stock. Here are a couple of examples:
=GoogleFinance("AAPL"; "price")
=GoogleFinance("GOOG"; "volume")
They ask:
What's the current price of Apple Computer shares?
What's the current trading volume of Google shares?
Google returns the answers based on current stock market data, although the data may be as much as 20
minutes old (which doesn't seem like much, but things change quickly on Wall Street).
If you've got a spreadsheet that lists stocks in one column, and you want the next column to display the current
price of those stocks, you could write a GoogleFinance formula that looks something like this (as shown in
Figure 3-20), which tells Google to use the contents of two cells for the symbol and the attribute:
=GoogleFinance(A2; A1)
Translated into English, this formula says, "Hey, Google! See what's in cell A1? Look that up for the contents of
cell A2, and then plant the result here."

Use a dollar sign ($) to make it easy to copy a formula into adjacent cells. In formulas,
the dollar sign indicates an absolute reference, which tells the spreadsheet that a value
doesn't change, no matter which cell it's in. For example, if the formula is
=GoogleFinance(A2; A$1), you can drag that formula down to fill all the cells in column
B. For each cell, the attribute remains the same: the contents of cell A1.
Figure 3-20. In this example, the formula that's in cell B2 means, "For the contents of cell A2 (AAPL)
find the contents of cell A1 (price)." All the cells in column B use a variation of this formula to
display the prices of various stocks.
NOTE
The GoogleFinance function currently works only in English—and it doesn't deal with most non-U.S.
market data, although you might be able to use a couple of international symbols. Google's working to
make this function support more markets, so if you're interested in international finance, give
GoogleFinance a try and see if your formula works.
 

 
3.12. Labeling Cells and Columns with Range Names
Naming ranges of cells can really simplify your formula writing. Instead of trying to remember exactly which
cells define the range, you can create a descriptive, easy-to-remember name, and then insert that name into
the formulas you write, which saves you a lot of work. This section explains how to use range names.
3.12.1. Create a Range Name
Ready to name a range of cells? Here's all you have to do:
Open your spreadsheet, and then select a range of cells. (You can also specify the range later in the
process—see step 2.) Then click the Formulas tab.
The Formulas tab opens, as shown back in Figure 3-18.
1.
Click "Range names"
"Define new".
Docs opens the Range Names box, shown in Figure 3-21. If you selected a range of cells in step 1, then
they appear in the cell range text box, to the right of the Nickname text box.
2.
In the Nickname box, give the range a name. (For example, if you're a teacher working on a spreadsheet
that tracks grades, you could select all your students' names, and then call the range "Students".) If you
haven't already chosen a range of cells, or if you want to edit the range that appears in the box, do so in
the cell range box using the format upper-left cell:lower-right cell (for example, A2:H2). Then click Save.
Docs adds your new range name to the list in the Range Names box. If you want, you can click the "Add
another" link at the bottom of the box to name a different range by repeating step 3.
3.
When you're finished, click Done.
Docs returns you to your spreadsheet.
4.
Now, you can work with range names in your spreadsheet formulas (explained next) instead of always typing
individual cell indicators to define ranges. And when you click the Formulas tab's "Range names" button, your
new range name appears on its menu. Click the range name to select its cells.
Figure 3-21. Using a range name lets you gives an easy-to-remember name to a range of cells.

If you want to publish a range of cells ([click here]), use a range name to tell Google
which cells to publish.
3.12.2. Use a Range Name in a Formula
Now that you've created a range name, you can use it in your formulas. If you're like most people and tend to
think in words more than numbers, this ability can save you a lot of time.
Here's a quick example: The spreadsheet in Figure 3-21 contains a list of stocks and their current prices. The
prices, cells B2–B7, are a named range called price. If you want to find the average price and display it in the
cell below the individual stock prices, then you could double-click cell B8 and write this formula in it:
=Average(price)
This formula tells Docs to calculate the average of the values in the cells whose range is named price (that is,
cells B2–B7).
3.12.3. Change a Named Range

You manage range names from the same place you created them: the Formulas tab's Range Names box. If you
want to alter a range—to include more cells or cut a few out—click the Formulas tab
Range names
Manage. This action opens the Range Names box shown in Figure 3-21. Click the name of the range you want to
open for editing, and then, in the cell range box, make your edits. Click Save, and then click Done, and Docs
saves your changes.
3.12.4. Delete a Range Name
If you no longer need a range that you've named and you want to remove it from the list, click Formulas
Range names
Manage to open the Range Names box. Scan the list to find the range name you want to
delete, and then click the X to its right. Docs removes the name from that range of cells and the range names
list.
NOTE
When you delete a range name, any existing formulas that use the range name won't work anymore. So
double-check that you're not using a range name before you delete it.
 

 
3.13. Working with Charts
Spreadsheets are great at holding and organizing all kinds of complex information, but staring at row after row
and column after column can make viewers go cross-eyed. When you want to emphasize certain information or
illustrate a trend—like an unexpected rise in monthly household expenses or skyrocketing sales—a chart is the
best way to get your point across. Charts have a strong impact and are easy to interpret. When you create a
chart in Google Docs, you can keep it with your spreadsheet or insert it into a separate word processing
document, such as a quarterly report.
Docs can create the following kinds of charts from your spreadsheet data:
Column charts display your data in vertical columns. Different columns of equal width vary in height to
compare data. Figure 3-22 shows an example. (The "Add" button on the Edit toolbar also shows a tiny
column chart.)
Figure 3-22. These two charts illustrate the same data: household expenses over the course of
a year. The column chart (on the left) shows months along the x-axis and expenses along the
y-axis. The bar chart (on the right) reverses the axes: months are on the y-axis and expenses
on the x-axis.
Bar charts display your data in horizontal bars. (That's why this kind of chart is sometimes called a
horizontal bar chart.) The length of the bars as they stretch across the page shows variations in data.
Figure 3-22 illustrates the difference between a bar chart and a column chart.
NOTE
Docs can make regular or stacked bar and column charts. The regular column chart in Figure 3-22
(left) shows one column for each category of data; because there are several categories, multiple
columns cluster together in each month. A stacked column chart stacks these expenses into a
single, thicker column per month, with a different color representing each type of data. Figure 3-23
compares a regular column chart with a stacked column chart.

Figure 3-23. When you have multiple categories of data (here, categories of household
expenses), a regular column chart (left) can look a bit crowded. Stacking the categories into a
single column (right) makes the chart easier to read.
Pie charts represent data in a circle divided into different-colored pieces. Each piece is proportionate to
the amount data it depicts.
Figure 3-24. Both of these charts show trends in various household expenses, by month, over the
course of a year. The line chart (left) connects data points with lines. The area chart (right) takes
the line chart and shades the area beneath each line.
Line charts show data as a series of points connected by a line. As Figure 3-24 shows, line charts are
great for showing trends over time.
Area charts are line charts all dressed up. They emphasize changes in values by shading the part of the

chart that's below the line connecting the data points. Figure 3-24 compares an area chart with a line
chart.
Scatter charts (sometimes called XY charts) display your data as a set of points. In a scatter chart, both
axes represent numbers: The x-axis holds one set of numerical data, and the y-axis holds the other set.
The chart combines x and y values into single data points, and shows them in clusters. Scientists and
engineers often use scatter charts to show and compare numeric values, such as statistical data. Figure 3-
25 gives an example of a scatter chart.
Figure 3-25. Scatter charts are great for helping to make sense out of statistical data. This chart
shows a correlation between temperature and an air pollution index; the higher the air temperature,
the more pollution.
Confused about when to use a line chart versus when to use a scatter chart? The answer
lies in the x-axis. If the x-axis shows categories, like months or sales regions, use a line
chart. But if the x-axis contains numerical values, use a scatter chart.
As Figure 3-26 shows, each of these chart types has subtypes you can play around with. Column, bar, and pie
charts even let you go 3-D to give your chart extra visual impact.

Figure 3-26. As you create a chart, Docs gives you a preview of how the finished chart will look. So
you know what you're getting before you click "Save chart".
3.13.1. Create a Chart
Charts pack a mighty visual punch, and Google Docs makes it easy to transform spreadsheet data into a chart
or two. Here's how:
Open your spreadsheet (make sure it's on the Edit tab), and select the range of cells you want to convert
into a chart. Click the "Add chart" button on the toolbar, or click Insert
Chart.
Docs opens the Create Chart box, shown in Figure 3-26, which gives you a bunch of options:
What type? Select the kind of chart you want to create. When you do, available subtypes appear in
the next row—pick the one you want.
What data? If you selected a range of cells to get started, they appear in the text box here. You
can edit the cell range: Use the A1:M6 format—range names ([click here]) don't work here. Then tell
Docs whether to group the data by rows or columns (if you're not sure, click a radio button, and
then, in the right-hand Preview section, check out the effect), and whether you want to use
1.

spreadsheet content as labels.
Labels. If you want your chart to have a title at the top, in the "Chart title" box, type the title. You
can also create labels for the axes and move the legend to a different location on the chart (or take
it out altogether). The "Reverse categories" checkbox flips the order of the categories your chart
shows. For example, if you have days of the week across the x-axis, starting with Monday and
ending with Friday, Docs changes the order from Friday to Monday.
Preview. Nothing to select here; this section shows the effect of your choices as you make them.
What you see here is what you get in your chart.
Make your selections, checking out their effects in the Preview section, and then click "Save chart".
Docs creates your chart and inserts it in your spreadsheet.
2.
3.13.2. Edit a Chart
After you've created a chart, you might discover that you need to fix a typo in a label or adjust the cell range
that's included. To make changes in your chart, click it. Docs puts a box around the chart and brings up the
Chart menu in the box's upper-left corner, as shown in Figure 3-27.
To make changes to the chart, click Chart
Edit. This action opens the Create Chart box, with the info for the
chart in its current incarnation already filled in. Make whatever changes you want, and then click "Save chart".
Docs revises your chart to reflect the changes.
Figure 3-27. When you click a chart, a Chart button appears in its upper-left corner. Click it to open
the Chart menu (circled), where you can edit, delete, or publish your chart, or save it as an image to
insert into a document (see [click here]).

3.13.3. Move or Resize a Chart
You don't have to leave your new chart where Docs inserted it. To move a chart, click it, and then put your
cursor in the top part of the gray box that surrounds the chart. When the cursor changes to a pointing hand,
click and drag the chart to where you want it.
You can also change the size of a chart. Click the chart, and then move your cursor to one of the outer edges
(left, right, or bottom) of the box that contains it. The cursor changes to a double-headed arrow, which means
you can click and drag the border to resize the chart. If you change your mind about resizing, just click Undo.
3.13.4. Save a Chart As an Image
After you've made a great-looking chart, you probably want to share it by inserting it into a report or tacking it
up by the water cooler to impress your colleagues. Before you can get a chart into a word processing document
or presentation slide, you need to save it as an image—which you can do in just a couple of steps:

Click the chart, and then, in the chart's upper-left corner, click Chart
"Save image".
A download window opens, asking what you want to do with the file: Open it or save it to disk.
1.
Turn on the "Save to disk" radio button, and then click OK.
Your computer saves the file to your Desktop as a PNG file (a type of image file).
2.
From there, you can insert the PNG file into a document as you would any other image. If you want to insert the
chart into a Google document, flip back to [click here] for the super-easy how-to.
NOTE
After you've transformed a chart into an image, its data no longer changes when spreadsheet data does.
3.13.5. Publish a Chart
In Google Docs, publishing a chart means putting it on a Web page. To do that, click the chart, and then click
Chart
"Publish chart". Google opens a box like the one shown in Figure 3-28. The box contains some HTML
code—don't worry, you don't need to understand what it means. You just have to copy the code and paste it
into a Web page's code to insert your chart in that Web page. (Ask a geeky friend if you need help, or check out
Creating Web Sites: The Missing Manual.)
Figure 3-28. To insert a chart into a Web page, copy the HTML code in the Publish Chart box (shown
here), and then paste that code into the Web page's code. Click Done to close this box.
3.13.6. Delete a Chart

Charts can outlive their usefulness as the data in a spreadsheet changes. To delete a chart, click it, and then
click Chart
"Delete chart", and the chart disappears.
There's no confirmation box to make sure you really want to delete the chart—as soon
as you select "Delete chart", the chart is history. If you delete a chart by mistake,
though, you can get it back. Either click the Undo button, or, if you deleted the chart a
while back, click the Revisions tab ([click here]), find an older version of the spreadsheet
that contains the banished chart, and revert ([click here]) to that version. If all else
fails, you can always recreate the chart from scratch.
 

 
3.14. Displaying Data with Gadgets
As Chapter 8 explains, Google gadgets are mini-programs that you can insert into Web pages. On iGoogle
(Chapter 8), for example, gadgets can show local weather reports or current news headlines. In a spreadsheet,
gadgets can show your data in different ways. For example, one gadget creates a pivot table to quickly
summarize long lists of data. Other gadgets can create a timeline, a tree-style organization chart, and even a
chart that shows dollar amounts as piles of money.
To add a gadget to a spreadsheet:
Open the spreadsheet, and then select the range of data you want the gadget to show. Click Insert
Gadget or the Add button, and then select Gadget.
Google opens the Add a Gadget box, shown in Figure 3-29.
1.
Use the categories on the left side of the box to browse. When you find a gadget you want to use with
your spreadsheet, click its "Add to spreadsheet" button.
A new box opens, like the one in Figure 3-30, where you can enter any info needed to create the gadget.
This info varies for each gadget, but typically you can adjust the cell range and give the gadget a title.
2.
Fill in any required info, and then click Save.
The box displays the gadget. If you need to, adjust the gadget's settings.
3.
When the gadget is looking good, click "Save & close".
Google inserts the gadget into your spreadsheet—Figure 3-31shows an example. As your data changes, so
does the gadget.
4.
Figure 3-29. Gadgets that work with Google spreadsheets let you display the spreadsheet's data in
various ways, from dials on a gauge to pivot tables to timelines and org charts. Browse the
categories on the left to see the gadgets on the right. When you see a gadget you like, click "Add to
spreadsheet".

Figure 3-30. Fill in any required info, and then click Save to see a preview of the gadget in the
bottom part of the box. If it looks good, click "Save & close" to put the gadget into your spreadsheet.

Figure 3-31. This gadget shows money values as stacks of $100 bills—a nice way to feel rich when
you're looking at your stock portfolio.

After you've inserted a gadget in a spreadsheet, you can edit it by clicking the gadget (so a gray frame appears
around it), and then clicking the gadget's upper-left Edit button. Docs opens a box like the one you used to
create the gadget (Figure 3-30), where you can make adjustments to its settings. Click "Save & close" when
you're done.
You can also work with gadgets in other ways. Click the gadget, and then click its upper-right arrow for these
options:
Publish Gadget generates HTML that you can copy and paste into an HTML file to embed the gadget in a
Web page. (See [click here] for more about embedding gadgets in Web pages.)
Add to iGoogle puts the gadget on your iGoogle page (see Chapter 8).
Delete Gadget removes the gadget from your spreadsheet.

3.15. Printing a Spreadsheet
If you need to put your spreadsheet on paper, you've got a couple of different options: You can print it as a PDF
file, or export it as an HTML file, and then print it from your browser window. And if you want to get really
tricky, you can print your spreadsheet without gridlines. This section explains all your options.
3.15.1. Print as a PDF
A PDF (portable document format) file retains its formatting regardless of what kind of computer or operating
system the viewer is using. So creating a PDF is a good way to make sure your spreadsheet looks the same to
everyone. Printing PDF involves two steps:
Convert the spreadsheet to a PDF file.
1.
Print the PDF.
2.
In your spreadsheet, click the upper-right Print link, or click File
Print. Either method opens the Print
Settings box, which looks just like the "Export to PDF" box shown back in Figure 3-5, except for the different
name, and the button at the bottom of the box now says Print instead of Export. Fill out the Print Settings box
according to the directions on [click here], and then click Print.
A window opens, asking how you want to handle the file. You want to open the file with Adobe Reader, and then
print it from there. So tell Docs to use Adobe Reader to open the file, and then click OK. Your computer
downloads the PDF file and opens it in Adobe Reader, giving you a preview of how the printed spreadsheet will
look. Click File
Print to open the Reader's Print window, and then click OK to print your spreadsheet.
3.15.2. Print from an HTML File
This is a quick 'n' easy way to print a spreadsheet. As [click here] explains, when you export a spreadsheet as
HTML (File
Export
.html), a new browser window opens to display the file. Then you can print the
spreadsheet directly from the browser window (just go to your browser's File menu, and then choose Print).
You can export only one spreadsheet at a time as an HTML file. If you want to print
multiple pages, print the spreadsheet as a PDF, turning on the Print Settings box's "All
sheets" radio button.
The only problem with printing from a browser is that the printed page displays stuff in the header and footer
that you might not want there, like a Web address and the time and date of printing. That may be fine for a
draft, but you probably don't want all that extraneous info on a spreadsheet you print to distribute to
coworkers.
You can tell your browser to clean up headers and footers before it sends the file to your printer. How you do
that depends on your browser and your computer's operating system. After the exported HTML file has opened

in a new browser window, follow the appropriate instructions for adjusting headers and footers on the printed
page:
Internet Explorer 6. Select File
Page Setup. In the Page Setup box that opens, in the Headers and
Footers section, make sure that Header and Footer text boxes are both empty, and then click OK.
Internet Explorer 7. Click the drop-down arrow next to the Print button (which looks like a miniature
printer), and then select Page Setup. When the Page Setup box opens, clear anything that's in the Header
and Footer text boxes, and then click OK.
Firefox for Macs. Select File
Print. In the box that opens, click the Copies & Pages drop-down menu,
and then select Firefox. At the bottom of the box, check to make sure that the options for Page Headers
and Page Footers are all set to "blank", and then click OK.
Firefox for PCs. Choose File
Page Setup. In the Page Setup box that opens, click the Margins &
Header/Footer tab. In the Headers & Footers section, make sure all the options are set to "blank", and
then click OK.
3.15.3. Print a Spreadsheet Without Gridlines
If you want your spreadsheet to print as a table without any gridlines, you have to get tricky and edit its URL
just a bit. Here's how:
Publish the spreadsheet ([click here]).
When you publish a spreadsheet, Docs assigns it a URL (an online address) and posts it on the Web.
1.
On the spreadsheet's Publish tab, click the URL for the spreadsheet. (It's the link just under the words
"Your document is viewable at:".)
A new browser window opens, displaying the published spreadsheet.
2.
Click inside your browser's address bar. At the end of the URL, add this text: &gridlines=false. (Don't
include the period.) Then hit Enter.
Your browser displays the spreadsheet with the gridlines erased. From here, you can print the
spreadsheet—minus gridlines—directly from your browser.
3.
 

 
3.16. Deleting a Spreadsheet
Google Docs can hold up to a thousand spreadsheets in each Docs account, so you may never again have to
part with one. But if you decide it's time to make a clean break, you can easily nix any file you want.
NOTE
Even though the Edit tab's toolbar has a Delete button, you can't use it to delete a whole spreadsheet
(just individual rows and columns). Selecting an entire spreadsheet, and then clicking Delete and trying
to delete all rows or all columns just gets you an oops message telling you that you can't do that.
On your Docs home page, in the Docs list, find the spreadsheet you want to delete. Select it by turning on its
checkbox, and then click the Delete button to toss it in the Trash.
If you have a change of heart, you can undelete the spreadsheet by opening the Trash folder (in the left-hand
menu, click Trash), selecting the file, and then clicking Undelete to restore it to its former location on the Docs
list (and in any folders). If, on the other hand, you really want that spreadsheet to hit the road, just empty the
Trash (click the "Empty trash" button) and it's gone for good.
If you encounter an error message when you try to delete a spreadsheet from the Docs
list, it may be because you have that spreadsheet open in another window. Close the
spreadsheet, and then try again.
 

 
3.17. Sharing and Collaborating on Spreadsheets
People who are Google Docs veterans can't say it enough—the great thing about Docs is the ease with which
you can share your files, whether you're publishing a spreadsheet to the Web or getting your entire far-flung
sales team to work on the spreadsheet at the same time. This section explains how to share your documents
and get the most out of collaboration.
NOTE
If you sign into Google Docs through your organization's Google Apps account (if, for example, you sign
in at http://docs.mycompany.com), your domain administrator can restrict your ability to share
spreadsheets with people outside your company, and prevent you from receiving invitations to view
spreadsheets that don't belong to your domain—[click here] has the details.
3.17.1. Publishing a Spreadsheet on the Web
If you want to show your spreadsheet onlineto a bunch of people without letting them make changes to it, the
easiest method is to publish it on the Web. When your spreadsheet is a Web page, you can send its URL (Web
address) to anyone who might want to take a gander at it, or link to it from another Web page or a blog. All
people have to do is follow the link, and there's your spreadsheet, large as life.
To publish your spreadsheet, open it in Google Docs, click its far-right Publish tab, and then click the "Publish
now" button. Docs puts your spreadsheet on the Web and tells you its URL, as shown in Figure 3-32. Click the
link to see how your spreadsheet looks as a Web page.
Figure 3-32. After you've published a spreadsheet, the Publish tab (circled) looks like this. The top
part of the box contains a clickable URL that you can copy and send to colleagues to share your
published spreadsheet with them. Docs doesn't automatically update the published version of your
spreadsheet if you make changes to your data (unless you tell it to—see [click here]), so use this tab
to republish an edited spreadsheet to make sure the current version is online. You can also click
"Stop publishing" to take your spreadsheet off the Web.

NOTE
When you publish a spreadsheet, a Published label appears on the spreadsheet on your home page's
Docs list. This label makes it a cinch to find and manage published spreadsheets, as explained next.
3.17.1.1. Manage a published spreadsheet
One of the great things about Web-based publishing (as opposed to paper-based publishing) is that it's easy to
make tweaks to a document, and then republish the results right away—not to mention all the acres of trees
you save.
If you want to make changes to a spreadsheet you've published, open the spreadsheet and then click the
Publish tab to see a screen like the one in Figure 3-32. For an already-published spreadsheet, the Publish tab
has these options:
Re-publish this document. The published version of your spreadsheet doesn't automatically reflect
changes you make to your data. If you've made some changes to your data, and you want to update the
published version, then click this button. (The third item in this list explains how to automate this
process.)

Stop publishing. No longer need to share the spreadsheet? Click this button to take it off the Web.
Automatically re-publish when changes are made. If you want your published spreadsheet to reflect
up-to-the-minute info, but you don't want go back and click the "Re-publish this document" button every
single time you update your data, turn on this checkbox, and Docs does the republishing for you.
What parts? This drop-down menu lists the different sheets within your spreadsheet file. You can choose
to publish all the sheets, or pick just one. (If you make a change here, be sure to click "Re-publish this
document" so the change takes effect.)
Subscribe. Flip to [click here] to learn all about RSS feeds. These feeds work the same with spreadsheets
as they do with documents. To subscribe to a feed of changes to the spreadsheet, click this link.
More publishing options. Click this link to open the More Published Formats box shown in Figure 3-33.
In this box, you can change the following settings:
File format. Click the drop-down menu to choose a different file format for your published
spreadsheet. These formats include all the formats you can use for exporting ([click here]), as well
as HTML you can embed in a Web page and RSS formats.
What sheets? Choose all of 'em or just one.
What cells? If you want to publish just a range of cells, enter the range here in the format A1:G80.
Generate URL. Click this button to get the Web address of a page where you can see the results of
the settings you chose in this box.
Figure 3-33. The More Published Formats box lets you choose a format for your published
spreadsheet or select a range of cells. The URL generated here is different from the one listed on the
Publish tab.

3.17.2. Sharing a Spreadsheet
As Chapter 2 mentions, one of Google Docs' best features is that it lets you collaborate with others
simultaneously on the same document. Just as a team can write and edit the same document, working
simultaneously from different locations, several people can collaborate on a spreadsheet—working on the same
file, all at the same time.
Imagine that the Friends of the Library are getting ready to hold their annual week-long book sale. In the past,
scheduling volunteers has been a challenge—people would call or email the volunteer coordinator with their
preferred shift times, but this led to all kinds of scheduling conflicts, not to mention hours of back-and-forth on
the phone. Using Google Docs, the coordinator can create a spreadsheet that lists shifts and jobs that need

filling, like information desk, cashier, restocker, and so on. Then volunteers can sign up for shifts in real time,
on the actual Schedule spreadsheet. When someone signs up for, say, the 9-to-noon shift on Tuesday at the
Info Desk, everyone else can see that that shift's taken. The other volunteers can scan the schedule to see what
else is available and slot themselves right in—no more phone calls to say, "Well, Tuesday's taken—how about
Thursday? No? Okay, then how about...?"
With Google Docs, you can invite people to share your spreadsheet in two ways: as viewers or as collaborators.
These roles have different privileges, as [click here] explains. (Basically, viewers can look at a spreadsheet but
not edit it, whereas collaborators can both edit and view a spreadsheet.) People in either role can download
copies of the spreadsheet to their computers. If you want people to have a look at your spreadsheet but not
touch its data, make them viewers (or publish the spreadsheet online, as described on [click here]). If, on the
other hand, you want a group of people to work on the spreadsheet with you, make them collaborators.
3.17.2.1. Invite viewers and collaborators
The Share tab for spreadsheets looks almost exactly like the Share This Document page for word processing
documents, as Figure 3-34 shows. Note the almost—there are a couple of important differences (explained
next). Overall, the process for inviting viewers and collaborators to access your spreadsheet is the same as it is
for sharing a document (turn back to [click here] and read up on the process.
Figure 3-34. If you've already shared a document or two in Google Docs, the Share tab for
spreadsheets will look pretty familiar. But note the two differences. Turning on the "to fill out a
form" radio button (circled) lets you invite people to add data to your spreadsheet by filling out a
Web-based form. You can also add people to this spreadsheet's Viewers list by turning on the
"Anyone can view this document at" checkbox (also circled). When you turn this checkbox on,
Google supplies a URL that you can copy and send to people. Anyone who views the spreadsheet at
that address gets added to your Viewers list.

But there are a couple of cool ways you can share a spreadsheet that don't apply to documents. The big news:
Docs now lets you collect data by creating a form for others to fill out—their responses go straight into your
spreadsheet; [click here] tells you all about it.
In addition, Docs gives you another way to add viewers that's different than the way you share documents. For
documents, your only option is to invite a viewer first, and then that person can look at your document. But
with spreadsheets, Docs can automatically add new viewers when they view the sheet via a special link: When
the person follows the link, Docs automatically adds him to the spreadsheet's official Viewers list. That way, he
can go back and take another look at the spreadsheet whenever he wants.
NOTE
Right now, Google places no limits on the number of people with whom you can share a spreadsheet, so
you can go crazy with your invitations. However, no more than 50 collaborators can work on a
spreadsheet simultaneously—but that's plenty for most people.
3.17.3. Working with Collaborators
After you've sent out the invitations to your spreadsheet party, the people you've invited can get to work on the
spreadsheet right away. When you're working in a spreadsheet and a collaborator or viewer opens it, Docs pops
up a notification box to let you know they're online with you. Click the Discuss tab (Figure 3-35) to see what
they're doing and have a chat as you work.
Figure 3-35. The Discuss tab (right) is where you see who's working on a spreadsheet with you and
what they're doing. The cell-presence indicator shows you which cell each collaborator is working on
right now. (If for some reason you don't want to see these indicators, click the "Hide collaborators'
locations" link, circled.) In the box at the bottom of Discuss tab, type messages to chat with your
collaborators as you work.

3.17.3.1. Who's editing what
One thing might seem a bit worrisome about multiple people editing the same spreadsheet all at once: What
happens if several people are trying to edit the same data simultaneously? Won't that mess everything up?
Not to worry. Docs makes it clear who's editing what, right now. When someone else is working on a
spreadsheet at the same time you are, their name appears on the Discuss tab, as shown in Figure 3-35. Next to
each name is a little box, and each box is a different color. Whatever cell a collaborator is working in gets
outlined in the same color as that collaborator's box. Google calls this the cell-presence indicator, and because
Docs updates in real time, you always know where your collaborators are working. (If somebody's working
where they're not supposed to be, you can have it out with them in the Discuss tab's chat box—keep reading to
learn about that.)
3.17.3.2. Chat about a spreadsheet
If your idea of collaborating on a project brings to mind people clustered around a table, talking about the
project and making changes as they go along, then collaborating on spreadsheets in Google Docs won't be that
much of an adjustment. When two or more people are working on a spreadsheet at the same time, the Discuss
tab opens a chat box (shown in Figure 3-35) so you and your coworkers can discuss the spreadsheet as you
work on it.
The Discuss tab tells you who's online with you and what they're working on. The bottom part of this tab has
two boxes: Type a comment in the bottom box, hit Enter, and the comment shows up in the top box, for all
your collaborators to read and respond to. When someone responds, her comment appears in the top box, just
below yours. After a few comments have appeared in the chat box, you can scroll up or down through all the
comments (in case you missed something when you went for a cup of coffee).
Chat too distracting? Maybe your colleagues are talking about last night's game instead of how to improve sales
figures. To close the chat box, in the Discuss tab's upper-right corner, click the x. You can always open it again

by clicking the Discuss tab.
NOTE
If you don't have the Discuss tab open, then the tab turns orange when a collaborator makes a comment
in the chat box, so you know there's a message.
3.17.3.3. Get change notifications
One of the great things about sharing spreadsheets is that any collaborator can work on it, from anywhere, at
any time. Of course, you want to stay on top of the changes that your coworkers try to sneak into the
spreadsheet while you were sleeping. Fortunately, you can have Google notify you whenever someone edits a
spreadsheet, so you never miss a thing.
To tell Google to send you email notifications of changes to a spreadsheet, open the spreadsheet you want to
keep an eye on. Then, above the spreadsheet editor, click Set Notification Rules. Google opens a dialog box like
the one in Figure 3-36. In the box, tell Google when to notify you by turning on any of the following checkboxes
(you can select more than one):
Any changes are made. Whenever someone changes the spreadsheet, whether by adding new values,
changing formatting, creating a formula—whatever—Google lets you know.
Figure 3-36. You can get an email from Google when a collaborator makes changes a
spreadsheet or when collaborators come and go. Emails arrive on an as-it-happens basis, or
once a day in digest form—it's your call.

Anything on this sheet is changed. If a worksheet is made up of several individual sheets, you can
keep an eye on just one sheet. (You can choose only one sheet from the drop-down list. If you want to
watch a couple of sheets in a big spreadsheet, set up another notification for the second sheet.)
Any of these cells are changed. If you just want to see what's happening to a particular range of cells,
click the text box here. Google opens another dialog box, called "What data?", where you can specify the
cell range. Google then inserts that range into the Notification Rules box.
Collaborators are added or removed. It's good to know when someone joins or leaves a project, and
this notification keeps you informed.
After you've specified what to watch for, tell Google how to notify you:
Email - daily digest. Turn on this checkbox to receive one email from Google per day, listing all the
changes made that day.
Email - right away. Turn on this checkbox if you want to get an email whenever changes are saved.
After you've made your selections, click Save, and Google creates the notification. Now, when someone edits
the spreadsheet, Google sends you an email to let you know (or sends you one at the end of the day). The
email tells you who made the change and what kind of change it was (adding values, for example). The email
also has a link you can click to view the spreadsheet with the changes highlighted.

After you've created at least one change notification, when you click Set Notification Rules above the
spreadsheet editor, you see a box that looks like the one in Figure 3-37, listing your notifications. From here,
you can do any of the following:
Add a new notification. Click the "Add another" link in the dialog box's bottom-left to create a new
notification.
Edit. To change an existing notification (maybe you're getting too many emails and want to switch to a
once-a-day digest), click this link, which opens a box that looks just like the one in Figure 3-36.
Delete. If you no longer need a notification, click this link. Google asks if you're sure; click OK, and the
notification is history.
Figure 3-37. Any notifications you've created are listed here. To create a new notification, click "Add
another" (circled). You can also edit or delete notifications from this box.
3.17.3.4. Share a copy as a template
Imagine a coworker comes to you and says, "I really like the way you set up the spreadsheet for the CHAOS
project. Can I use it as a template for Project Blather?" You could invite him to collaborate on the CHAOS
spreadsheet, but maybe you don't want him tinkering with its data. A better solution is to invite him as a
viewer, which lets him look at the spreadsheet but not change it. That way, he can download your spreadsheet
to his computer and use it as a template for his own project.
But what if you want to share a template or a form more widely, putting it on your Web page or blog for anyone
to use? Here's a trick that lets you do just that. It's like the process for sharing a spreadsheet by putting it on a
Web page ([click here]), but with a twist: When someone clicks the link to the spreadsheet, an identical—but
completely new and separate—version of it appears in his Docs list.

Follow these steps to create a template link:
Open the spreadsheet that others will use as a template, and then click the Share tab.
Docs opens the Share page, shown back in Figure 3-34.
1.
In the Advanced Options section, turn on the "Anyone can view this document at:" checkbox.
Docs generates a URL for sharing a published version of the spreadsheet, and displays it just below the
"Anyone can view this document at:" checkbox.
2.
Copy the URL, and then paste it into the email (or Web page or blog post) that lets others know about the
link. But you're not done yet! At the end of the URL, add this text: &newcopy. (Don't type the period.) This
little bit of text instructs Web browsers to make the link a template link.
3.
Send your email or upload the Web page or blog post.
Now, when someone clicks the link you've edited, an identical copy of your spreadsheet appears in his
Docs list, one that's separate from the original, so people can edit it as much as they like.
Anybody who's Web-savvy can edit the URL to gain access to your original
spreadsheet by simply removing the text you added (&newcopy). So use this trick
with caution. If your original spreadsheet holds sensitive data, don't share the link
too widely—somebody could use it to gain unauthorized access to your original
spreadsheet. Template links work best when they link to a spreadsheet that holds
just a bit of sample data.
4.
3.17.3.5. Insert a comment
Chatting about a spreadsheet lets you discuss it in real time, but you can also insert comments (notes attached
to specific cells) into the spreadsheet. You might want to do this if you're the only one working on the
spreadsheet at the moment and you want to leave a note for your collaborators (or even yourself).
To insert a comment, select the cell where you want the comment to appear, and then, on the Edit toolbar,
choose Insert
Comment, or right-click (control-click), and then, from the menu that appears, choose "Insert
comment". Either way, a box opens where you can type your comment, as Figure 3-38 shows. Comments show
the commenter's name and the date and time of creation.
When you're done typing your comment, click anywhere outside the comment box. The comment disappears,
and the upper-right corner of the cell that holds the comment shows a small orange dot. To view the comment,
just hover your cursor over that dot.
Figure 3-38. When you insert a comment, Docs opens a small text box where you can type your

comment. Cells that contain comments have a small orange dot (circled) in their upper-right corners.
3.17.3.6. Edit a comment
To edit a comment (either to change your own comment or respond to someone else's), hover your cursor over
the orange dot that indicates a comment in a cell. When the comment appears, click inside the comment box,
and then start typing. Click outside the box when you're done.
3.17.3.7. Delete a comment
To delete a comment, hover over the orange comment dot, and then click inside the comment box. Delete all
the text in the box (including the commenter's name and the date/time stamp). Then click outside the now-
empty comment box, and the comment indicator disappears.
3.17.4. Creating a Form
A lot of people simply don't speak spreadsheet. Present them with an array of rows and columns and say, "Here,
edit this," and they'll look at you blankly—or jump in and mess up your data.
But forms are a different matter. People have been filling out forms since they first learned to write their names
back in kindergarten. In Docs, you can create a form and invite others to fill it out. That way, instead of trying
to make sense of rows and columns, they enter text into text boxes or select from drop-down lists. And the best
part is that when someone completes the form, the data it contains gets added to your
spreadsheet—automatically.
You can create a form from any spreadsheet. To get started, open your spreadsheet, and then click the Share
tab (Figure 3-34). In the "Invite people" section, turn on the "to fill out a form" radio button, and then click the
"Start editing your form" button to open the "Edit form" window shown in Figure 3-39.
Figure 3-39. Docs shows you the fields on your form, which it gets from your spreadsheet's column
headers (the data in row 1). When you click a field, arrows and an edit link (circled) appear to its
left. Use the arrows to move the field up or down on the form. Click the edit link to choose a field
type.

3.17.4.1. Step 1: Create the form
The "Edit form" window shows the title of your form (it's the same as the name of your spreadsheet) and lists
the fields that will make up your form (Docs takes these from the column headers of your spreadsheet). You can
change the form's title and (if you want) add a description to announce what the form's all about. You can also
move, edit, or delete any field. When you click the edit link (circled in Figure 3-39) to edit a field, Docs gives
you the following options:
Question title. This option is the name of the field, like Name or Email Address.
Help text. If you want, you can add a line of text here to explain the field or elaborate on your question.

Question type. This option determines the kind of field that the form presents to the viewer. Docs can
handle these field types:
Text. A one-line text box.
Paragraph text. A larger text box for the loquacious.
Multiple choice. This option creates radio buttons on the form; viewers can choose just one.
Checkboxes. Viewers can select multiple checkboxes (see Figure 3-40).
Choose from a list. This option lets viewers make one selection from a drop-down list.
Add a question. At the bottom of the page is a link you can click to add a brand-new question (that is, a
brand-new field) to your form. When you add a new field here, Docs also adds it as a column header to
your spreadsheet (so it'll know where to stow incoming data for that field).
Figure 3-40. This example shows a list of checkboxes. Viewers can check more than one to show an
interest in more than one kind of musical instrument.

3.17.4.2. Step 2: Share the form
When you've got your questions looking good, at the bottom of the "Edit form" box, click the "Next, choose
recipients" button to save your form and hop to the Preview and Send page, shown in Figure 3-41.
Figure 3-41. The left side of the Preview and Send page is where you list the people you're inviting
to fill out the form, and where you fine-tune the invitation. The right side shows what your form will
look like.

The right side of the Preview and Send page shows what your new form looks like. The left side is where you tell
Docs whom you want to view your form. Type or paste email addresses into the To box, and Docs sends your
form to these people when you click the Invite People button. (If you have a Gmail account, you can use your
Gmail Contacts list—[click here]—to select recipients.) You can also set these preferences:
Include form in invitation email. Leave this checkbox turned on if you want a copy of the form to
appear inside the invitation email. Recipients can fill out the form, and then submit it right from their
email programs.
NOTE
Not all email programs can read and display the form. Just in case the form doesn't display
correctly in the email, Docs also includes a link recipients can click (or paste into a Web browser)
to get to a page with a live version of the form.
Let people see existing responses. Leave this checkbox turned off if you're collecting personal
information or just don't want respondents to be influenced by what other folks have entered.
Custom confirmation message. If you want people to see a personal message after they fill out your

form—something along the lines of "Thanks for helping me out!"—type it here.
When your list of recipients is complete (or complete enough for now, anyway), click Invite People. Google
sends out your invitations. Now all you have to do is sit back and wait for their responses to add data to your
spreadsheet.
3.17.4.3. View the results
When people fill out and submit the form, their responses go straight into your spreadsheet, as Figure 3-42
shows. (Docs adds a time-stamp column to the beginning of the spreadsheet, where it notes the date and time
each response arrived.) Then you can work with the information just like any other data.
Figure 3-42. Information entered by form recipients goes straight into the spreadsheet that
generated the form. Column A, which Docs creates automatically, shows the date and time the info
arrived. When a spreadsheet gets data from forms, two new links appear (circled): click "Go to live
form" to visit the form on the Web, or click "Edit or resend form" to tweak your form or send out
more invitations.
3.17.4.4. Edit a form
As Figure 3-42 shows, a spreadsheet that's gathering data through a form has a couple of new links at the top:
Go to live form takes you to the form itself.
Edit or resend form takes you back to the Edit Form page.
If you need to make changes to a form—anything from correcting a typo to changing a field's type to adding a
new field—click "Edit or resend form". Make your changes in the same way you did when you created the form
([click here]). Click "Next, choose recipients" to save the revised form.

As when you created the form, you land on the Preview and Send page. If you want to invite more people to fill
out the form, you can do that here. If you don't want to invite anyone else for now, you're done.
You can also edit a form from the Share tab. Click Share
"Edit or resend form" to
open the "Edit form" box.
3.17.4.5. Turn off a form
If you've collected enough data for now, thanks, you can turn off the form so it's no longer live. Open the
spreadsheet that the form's based on, and then click its Share tab. On the right side of the page, you see a
button labeled "Turn off form". Click it, and your form no longer sends data to your spreadsheet. You can always
come back to the Share tab and turn your form back on.
3.17.4.6. Track responses on your iGoogle page
When you create a new form, Google sends you a confirmation email. The bottom of the email has some text
that says something like, "Tip: Keep an eye on forms and new responses using the Forms iGoogle gadget." The
words "Forms iGoogle gadget" are a link; click it to open a page that lets you add the Forms gadget to your
personalized iGoogle page. Google gadgets ([click here]) let you display content from Google Docs and other
apps on your iGoogle page (see Chapter 8). The Forms gadget helps you keep track of your forms, as Figure 3-
43 shows: respondents' names, the number of responses, and whether any of those responses are new. As a
super-convenient plus, you can launch the form creation process right from this gadget by clicking the "New
form" link. When you create a form this way, Docs also creates a new spreadsheet to collect its data.
Chapter 8 tells you everything you need to know to set up your iGoogle page and put it
to work.
Figure 3-43. Adding the Forms gadget (circled) to iGoogle lets you keep track of your forms, even
when you're not in Google Docs. For each form, iGoogle shows you the total number of responses in
parentheses. And when you receive a new response, the gadget lets you know. Click the name of any
form to open its associated spreadsheet. Create a new form (and a spreadsheet to go with it) by
clicking the "New form" link.

 

 
3.18. Turn Back Time: Your Spreadsheet's Revision History
As you work in your spreadsheet, Docs is busy behind the scenes, saving your work. So busy, in fact, that after
you've saved once, you don't have to worry about saving as you work. Just click Save & Close when you're done
to make sure the very latest changes get saved, and Docs takes care of the rest.
In Google Docs, each saved version doesn't replace the previous saved version. Instead, Docs stamps the time
and date on each save and adds it to the list of revisions. You can see this list by going to the Revisions tab,
shown in Figure 3-44. Here, you can choose a particular version of your file from the Revisions drop-down list;
each revision on the list shows the date and time of a change, who made it, and what kind of change it was.
Select a revision to see it on the screen. You can easily see what changes were made to the previous version of
the file, because Docs highlights changes in orange. If it's not the one you were looking for, you can page
through the different versions, one at a time, by clicking the Older and Newer buttons above your spreadsheet.
Figure 3-44. On a spreadsheet's Revisions tab, the drop-down list shows earlier versions of the
spreadsheet, along with the time the changes were made, who made them, and what kind of
changes they were. You can look at different revisions one by one using the Older and Newer
buttons (circled). If you want to make the version on your screen the current version, click the
"Revert to this one" button (also circled).
NOTE
Clicking the Edit tab while you're looking at a revision takes you back to the current version of your
spreadsheet.

You can't edit revisions—they're just for viewing. That makes sense, since you want to edit the current version.
But say you've been working all morning entering changes that the boss insisted on. Now, as you're about to
take a coffee break, the phone rings. It's the boss, blithely telling you to forget about making those changes.
There's no need to quit on the spot, or even cut your coffee break short. Just find the last version of the
spreadsheet that Docs saved before you started making those boss-mandated changes. When you find it, you
can go back to that earlier version by clicking the "Revert to this one" button. Docs asks if you're sure you want
to want to switch back to the earlier version now on the screen; click OK to confirm. And presto changeo—the
previous version becomes the current one, and what was the current version gets saved as a revision (so you
can revert back to it if your boss changes his mind again). Go ahead and take a couple of extra minutes for your
break—you've earned it.
 

 
Chapter 4. Creating Slideshow Presentations
Hard to believe, but our ancestors actually gave presentations without PowerPoint. And while slideshow-
dominated meetings probably won't disappear in our lifetime, Microsoft's dominance may not be so entrenched.
That's thanks to the newest member of the Google Docs team. Introduced in September 2007, Google Docs
slideshow tool is a snap to use, even if you've never created a presentation—something no one would ever say
about the powerful but complex PowerPoint. And Google's version stands out in one other key area:
collaboration and sharing. As with Google Docs spreadsheets and documents, you can tap into your
presentations from any Internet-connected computer, and invite others to work on presentations with you. But
it gets better: You can give your presentation over the Web right in Google Docs—with no need to set up a Web
conference room—and chat online with people about the slides during the show.
If you're a PowerPoint artiste who likes to create elaborate confections—say, zooming bullet points accompanied
by whooshing sound effects—you're likely to be disappointed with Docs presentations. Right now, Docs doesn't
offer fancy features like animations or transitions.But for whipping up a quick, simple, and easy-to-share
slideshow, Docs presentations are great. Read on to learn how.
4.1. Getting Started with Google Docs Presentations
If you haven't yet signed up for a Google Docs account, flip back to [click here] and get cracking—it takes less
than 5 minutes. For a quick tour of the dashboard-style Docs home page (where you organize and manage all
your Docs presentations, spreadsheets, and word processing files), see [click here].
NOTE
When you sign up for a Google Docs account ([click here]), you create a Google Account at the same
time. And what good is a Google Account? Chapter 1 tells you. The short version: It's your (free) ticket
to using all the tools and services in the Google kingdom.

4.2. Creating a Presentation
As with documents and spreadsheets, Google gives you two ways to create a new presentation from scratch:
From the Docs home page ([click here]): Click New
Presentation.
From the presentation editor (the central workspace where you create and edit individual slides; see
Figure 4-1): If you're already working on a presentation and want to start a new one, then select File
New.
Figure 4-1. Creating a new presentation opens this window, with the Edit tab (circled) selected. Use
the editing pane (right) to create and edit slides. The slide-sorter pane (left) shows multiple slides
in the presentation—once you've created them. You can select, insert, move, copy, and delete slides
in this pane.
Wherever you start, the presentation editor opens to a new, blank presentation, as shown in Figure 4-1. From
there, you can choose a theme (a ready-to-use design package; see [click here]), give your presentation a title
(explained next), and start creating individual slides ([click here]). Docs also adds the new presentation to the
Docs lists on its home page, as Figure 4-2 shows.

Figure 4-2. When you create or import a new presentation, Docs adds it to the top of your Docs list.
You can tell which files are presentations by their slide-and-orange-play-button symbol (circled).
4.2.1. Name your presentation
When you create a new presentation, the first slide that greets you in the editing pane is laid out like the
opening screen in a slideshow, as Figure 4-1 shows: one text box for the presentation's title, and one for its
subtitle, if you want one. Just click where it says "Click to add title", and then start typing; Docs grabs what you
type, and uses it to name the presentation automatically, saving you some work.
NOTE
If you don't want Google to use this title as your presentation's name—that is, as the file name you see
in the Google Docs list—see the following list.
If you haven't typed anything in the first slide's Title box by the time Google performs its first autosave (which
happens every 10 minutes; see [click here] for details), Docs christens your presentation with the unimaginative
name Untitled Presentation. Assuming you want something a bit more descriptive, you've got a few different
ways to name (or rename) a presentation:
From the Docs list. Select the presentation by turning on its checkbox, and then click the Rename
button. The file's name changes to a text box; type in the new name, and then hit Enter (Return).
Alternatively, you can right-click the presentation's name, and then, from the menu that appears, select
Rename.
From the presentation editor. If you've got the presentation open, use one of these methods:

Click File
Rename.
In the upper-left part of the page, click the presentation's current name.
Either method opens a box where you can name (or rename) the file. Enter the new name, and then click OK.
4.2.2. Importing an Existing Presentation
If you work with presentations a lot, then you probably already have some existing slideshows you'd like to
upload so you can start collaborating on them or publish them on the Web. Here are your options:
Import the presentation from your computer.
Upload it from a Web site.
Email it.
This section gives you step-by-step instructions for each method. But first a few restrictions, limitations, and
downright shortcomings you need to know about:
At the moment, you can upload only PowerPoint (.ppt) or PowerPoint SlideShow (.pps) files to Google
Docs. (SlideShow is a presentation viewer program.)
If you have a presentation in OpenOffice Impress that you want to upload, open
the presentation in Impress, and then save it as a PowerPoint file by selecting File
Save As. In the "Save as type" drop-down list, choose "Microsoft PowerPoint
97/2000/XP (.ppt)", and then click Save. Now, with its new file format, you can
easily import the presentation into Google Docs.
When you import a presentation from your computer, the file can't be bigger than 10 MB. (If yours is
bigger than that, consider breaking it up into smaller files, and then importing those individually.)
When you upload a presentation from the Web, it can't be bigger than 2 MB.
When you email a presentation, the maximum size is 500 KB (that's just half a megabyte).
4.2.2.1. Import from your computer
To upload a PowerPoint presentation from your computer into Google Docs, follow these steps:

If you're on the Google Docs home page, click the Upload button. If you're in the Docs presentation editor,
select File
"Upload a file".
Either way, Docs opens the Upload a File page, shown in Figure 4-3.
Figure 4-3. The Upload a File page is your starting point for uploading slideshows into
Google Docs. You can also use the email address at the bottom of the page to send a file
straight into your Google Docs account. The right side of the page reminds you of size
and format limitations (circled).
1.
Click the Browse button.
A window opens that lets you browse for files on your computer.
2.
Find and select the file you want to upload, and then click Open.
The file path (which tells Docs where to find the presentation on your computer) appears on the Upload a
File page.
3.
If you want, give the presentation you're transferring a new name. (If you don't rename the file, then
4.

Docs uses its current file name, such as BrangelinaBabyTracker.ppt.) Then click Upload File.
Docs uploads the file, opening it in the presentation editor and adding it to the Docs list on your Docs
home page.
4.2.2.2. Upload from a Web site
If you've got a presentation on a Web site as described on [click here] and you'd like to get it into Google Docs,
the process is simple: In Google Docs, click the Upload button on the Docs home page, or File
"Upload a file"
in the presentation editor to get to the Upload a File page (Figure 4-3).
The Upload a File page has a text box with the label "Or enter the URL of a file on the web". This box is where
you put the Web address of your online presentation. Type in the URL if you know it by heart. Otherwise, open
the presentation in another browser window, copy its URL from the address bar, and then (back on the Upload a
File page) paste it into the box. If you want, give the file a name. Then click the Upload File button to transfer it
into Docs.
4.2.2.3. Email to Google Docs
One of the most convenient ways to get a file—whether a document, a spreadsheet, or a presentation—into
Google Docs is to email it. (The downside to emailing presentations is that they can be no larger than 500 KB.)
When you create a Google Docs account ([click here]), Google automatically assigns your account a unique
email address. This address is long and funny looking (which makes it hard for spammers to guess), but it's all
yours, and it automatically adds any attached .ppt or .pps file to your Docs list as a presentation. This special
email address appears on the Upload a File page, shown back in Figure 4-3, in the lower half of the page under
"Email-In Your Documents and Files".
To email a presentation to your Docs account, open your email program, and then start a new message. Paste
your unique Google Docs email address into the To line, and then attach the presentation you want to upload.
(You don't need to include a subject line or a "hi how are ya" note for Docs.) Then send the email.
Add your Google Docs email address to your address book (or, if you've got Gmail, to
your Contacts list) to save yourself some typing, and to make it easy to find.
When Docs receives an emailed presentation, it does two things:
Adds the presentation to your Docs list.
Sends you a confirmation email letting you know it's received the presentation.
NOTE

When Docs receives an emailed presentation, it sends the confirmation email to your registered
email address—that is, the address you used to open your Google Docs account. This may not be
the same email address you used to send the presentation. For example, say your work email
address (you@work.com) is the one you used to open your Google Docs account, but you sent the
presentation from your personal email account (you@home.com). In that case, the confirmation
email goes to you@work.com because that's the address Docs has on file.
If you don't get a confirmation email, Docs didn't get your presentation. Your file might have been bigger than
the 500 KB limit. Check the file's size, and then try again.
4.2.3. Saving a Presentation
From the moment you create (or import) a presentation, Docs works tirelessly behind the scenes to keep a
record of your changes. Every time Docs autosaves the file—which it does every few minutes—it adds a
snapshot of the current version to its Revisions list ([click here]). This feature makes it easy to go back and find
a previous version—even one from weeks or months ago.
Because Docs autosaves these snapshots so frequently, you don't have to worry a whole lot about saving as you
work. In fact, you need to manually save only two times:
When you first create a new presentation ([click here]).
When you finish an editing session on an existing presentation.
Even so, as you work, you can manually instruct Docs to save whenever you want. This is a good idea if you
want to make sure a particular version of your slideshow gets saved. To make that happen, do one of the
following:
Press Ctrl+S.
Click File
Save.
Click File
"Save as a new presentation" if you want to save a separate copy with a different name.
Click the upper-right Save button.
Click the upper-right Save & Close button if you're done working for now.
Docs saves the file on Google's computers so you can come back to it whenever you want.
4.2.3.1. Export a presentation as a PowerPoint file

Just as you can import PowerPoint files into Google Docs, you can export Google Docs presentations into
PowerPoint. So you can create a presentation in Docs, using its great collaborating tools, export the
presentation into PowerPoint to jazz it up with some animations and sound effects, and then show the
presentation using PowerPoint. (The animations don't work in Docs.)
Exporting a presentation to PowerPoint takes just a couple of clicks. Open the presentation, and then click File
"Save as PPT". Google converts the file to a .ppt file right away. A dialog box opens, asking whether you
want to open the .ppt file or save it to your computer. Choose "Open with", and then select the program you
want: PowerPoint or another presentation that works with .ppt files, such as OpenOffice Impress. PowerPoint (or
the program you chose) opens, with your presentation on display.
4.2.3.2. Export a presentation as a PDF
Turning files into PDFs (portable document format) lets you view, print, and easily share them since nearly
every computer in existence today can read this format. When you turn your presentation into a PDF, your
slides appear, one per page, with their formatting and images intact.
First, open the presentation, and then select File
"Save as PDF". Docs opens a box asking how you want to
handle the file: Save it to your computer or open it. (If you want to see how the presentation looks as a PDF,
open it with Adobe Reader; otherwise, save it to your computer.) Make your selection, and then click OK. If you
chose to open the PDF, you can save it after you've taken a look at it. In Adobe Reader, just go to File
"Save
a Copy", and then tell Reader where to save it.
If you need to give a full-screen presentation while you're not connected to the Internet,
press Ctrl+L to make Adobe Reader go full-screen. Click the current slide, or use the
arrow keys, to move to the next slide. When you're done with the presentation, press
Esc key to switch the PDF presentation out of full-screen mode.
4.2.3.3. Export a presentation as text
Say you created a presentation for a meeting and want to download the text to use in your notes. You don't
need themes or colors or shapes—you want just the facts, ma'am.
To export the text, open the slideshow, and then select File
"Save as Text". A box opens in your browser
asking whether you want to open the file in a text editor (such as Notepad or TextEdit) or save it. Choose the
option you want, and then click OK.
Docs harvests all the text from your presentation and opens (or saves) it as a text (.txt) file. The file has all the
words from your slides, but no pictures, shapes, or formatting (such as bulleted lists). Now you can copy and
paste everything into a document in your favorite word-processing program—which just might be Google Docs.
4.2.3.4. Discard changes
If you make some changes to a presentation, and then decide you don't like them, click the upper-right Discard
Changes button. This dumps the changes you made since the last save, and then closes the file. When you
reopen the file, you see the version before you made all your edits. Discarded changes don't make it into the
Revisions list ([click here]), so make sure you really want to get rid of them.

 

 
4.3. Editing a Presentation
Even though the Docs presentations editor is simple, you can use it to create sophisticated, professional-looking
slideshows. And because it's simple, you don't have to spend a lot of time learning how to use it. Google will
likely add features as time goes on, but as this section explains, there's a lot you can do right now, such as:
Add themes and layouts for sharp-looking slides.
Insert and resize photos and charts.
Add and format text and shapes.
Insert links to Web sites.
When you're working with a presentation, sometimes you have to right-click
(control-click) something, and then, from the menu that pops up, select an option.
This process can be a problem for Firefox users, because the Firefox right-click
menu can obscure the Docs right-click menu. To make Firefox give way when you
right-click in Docs, go to Firefox, and then select Tools
Options
Content tab.
(On a Mac, it's Firefox
Preferences
Content.) Then, to the right of Enable
JavaScript, click the Advanced button. Turn on the "Disable or replace context
menus" checkbox. Click OK, and then click OK again. Now you can see Docs'
context menus without Firefox getting in the way.
4.3.1. Quick-and-Easy Styling with Themes and Layouts
Themes and layouts make your presentation look good, and keep things consistent from one slide to the next. A
theme is a design that you can apply to a presentation, giving all your slides the same background, font, and
colors. Docs let you choose from a few attractive themes and background colors, or you can upload your own
image to use as a background. Layouts keep the placement of elements on slides consistent, so that slide titles
don't jump around and columns are evenly spaced. This section shows how to use themes, backgrounds, and
layouts to give your presentation some oomph.
4.3.1.1. Apply a Theme
When you create a new slideshow, the presentation editor looks like the one back in Figure 4-1, with a single
blank slide in the editing pane. Adding a theme at this point ensures that the whole show—including slides you
haven't yet created—presents a unified look with a predesigned background and complementary font. Here's
how to apply (or change) a theme:
On the Edit tab's right side, click "Change theme". Alternatively, right-click (control-click) the slide in the
editing pane, and then, from the pop-up menu, select "Change theme".
Docs opens the Choose Theme box, shown in Figure 4-4, which lets you choose from some predesigned
1.

themes. There aren't a ton of them—at this writing, Docs has 15 themes. Each theme has a preview image
to show you what it looks like.
Figure 4-4. Click "Change theme" (circled) to open this box. The current theme (in this
case, Blank) is highlighted. Click any theme to apply it to all the slides in your
presentation.
Click the theme you want.
Docs applies the theme to your presentation, changing any existing slides to the theme you chose. From
now on, any new slide you insert also uses this theme.
2.
If you decide you don't like the theme you chose, then you can change it by following
these steps again and picking a new theme.
4.3.1.2. Use Your Own Background Image
If Docs' predefined themes don't excite you, you might want to upload your own background image (to appear

on all your slides or just one). For example, you could use a company logo as a watermark on each slide, or
maybe just on the title slide.
If you're going to use a theme for the presentation as a whole and insert a background
image on just a couple of slides, apply the theme first, and then choose the background
for individual slides. Changing the theme applies that theme to all the slides in your
presentation, wiping out any background images you've inserted.
To add a background image, here's what you do:
In the editing pane, right-click (control-click) a slide. (If you want to change the background of just one
slide, make sure you've selected the slide—in the slide-sorter pane—whose background you want to
change.) From the menu that appears, select "Change background".
The Change Background box, shown in Figure 4-5, opens.
Figure 4-5. In the Change Background box, you can create a custom theme for your
presentation (or for a single slide). Click "Insert image" to upload an image from your
computer. To change the background color without inserting an image, click the
"Change background" button (circled), and then, from the palette that opens, select a
color.
1.

Click the "Insert image" link.
The section expands to include a text box and a Browse button.
2.
Click Browse.
A box opens so you can locate the image on your computer.
Images with an aspect ratio of 4:3 (width to height) work best for backgrounds.
That means if your image is 400 pixels wide, it should be 300 pixels high. The
slides in a presentation are 800 pixels wide by 600 pixels high, so if you want the
background image to take up the whole slide, make it that size before you upload
it. Otherwise, Google stretches the image to fill the slide, and it probably won't
look very good.
3.
Find the image you want, and then click Open.
The image's file name appears in the Change Background box.
4.
If you want to use this image as the background of all the slides in this presentation, turn on the "Apply
background to all slides" checkbox. If you just want it as the background of the current slide, leave the
5.

checkbox turned off.
Click OK, and Docs inserts the image you chose as the background.
6.
4.3.1.3. Change the Background Color
Maybe you don't need any fancy themes or background images, but you'd still like something a little more
flavorful than stark white. In that case, choose a background color for your presentation.
In the editing pane, right-click (control-click) the slide whose background you want to change, and then, from
the pop-up menu, choose "Change background". This opens the Change Background box shown in Figure 4-5.
Click the button that looks like a can of paint tipping over to see a palette of colors. Choose a color; if you want
to use that color as the background for the whole presentation, then turn on the "Apply background to all slides"
checkbox. Finally, click Save, and Docs applies the color you selected as the background.
4.3.1.4. Apply a Slide Layout
Docs offers several predefined layouts that help ensure that your slides look consistent, so that the title, for
example, doesn't jump around from slide to slide. When you insert a new slide ([click here]), Docs opens the
Choose Slide Layout box, shown in Figure 4-6.
Figure 4-6. When you create a new slide, you can choose from these ready-made layouts.

The layout box lets you choose from these common layouts:
Title. This layout is for your presentation's opening slide. You get two text boxes: one with a 36-point title
halfway down the page, and another with a 24-point subtitle beneath it.
Text. This layout has a text box for a 32-point title at the top of the slide, and a roomy text box beneath
it that's preset to a 20-point font.
Two columns. Like the text layout, this one has a 32-point title at the top, but instead of one large text
box it has two smaller text boxes side by side. This layout is helpful when you want to fit a long list of
bullet points onto a single slide.
Caption. Most of this layout is blank, with a small text box at the bottom preset to 24-point font, perfect
for the caption of a large image or chart ([click here] tells you how to insert an image).
Blank. No text boxes anywhere on this kind of slide, so it's good for a big image. Or you can easily add
text boxes to it, as [click here] explains.
Click a layout, and Docs uses it to format the new slide.
4.3.2. Adding, Moving, and Deleting Slides
As your presentation grows, you'll want to add, move, copy, delete, and otherwise work with its slides. This
section tells you everything you need to know to work with all your slides.
4.3.2.1. Insert a New Slide
To slot a new slide into your presentation, right-click (control-click) in either the slide-sorter pane or editing
pane, and then, from the menu, select "New slide", or, in the blue bar at the top of the presentation editor, click
"New slide". Either way, Docs opens the Choose Slide Layout box, shown in Figure 4-6. Click the layout you
want, and Docs creates a new slide with that layout, inserting it after the currently selected slide. Your new slide
has the same them as the slide that's currently selected.
4.3.2.2. Insert a Duplicate Slide
If you want to insert an exact copy of the slide that's currently in the editing pane, either right-click (control-
click) in the editing pane and, from the menu that appears, choose "Duplicate slide", or click "Duplicate slide" in
the blue bar at the top of the page. A duplicate slide appears right after the original. You can move the duplicate
within this presentation or paste it into a different presentation (see [click here]).

Here's a shortcut that lets you insert a duplicate slide wherever you want in the
presentation. In the slide-sorter pane, click (and hold) the slide you want to duplicate.
Then press the Ctrl key (the command key on a Mac) as you drag the slide where you
want the duplicate to appear. Release the mouse button and the Ctrl key, and a
duplicate appears where you told Docs to put it.
4.3.2.3. Import Slides
In Docs, importing a slide means copying a slide from one presentation and putting it into another. You can
import a slide from either another Docs presentation or a presentation that lives on your computer.
4.3.2.3.1. Import from another Docs presentation
If you've got a great slide in one Docs presentation that you want to reuse in another, open the file you want to
import the slide into. Then, follow these steps:
Select the slide you want the imported slide(s) to follow. Right-click (control-click) and, from the menu
that appears, choose "Import slides".
Docs opens the Import Slides box, shown in Figure 4-7. On its right side is a list of Google Docs
presentations from which you can import slides.
Figure 4-7. Use this box to tell Docs whether you want to import slides from another
Google Docs presentation or from a presentation on your computer.
1.

Find the presentation you want, and then click its name.
The Import Slides box changes to look something like the one in Figure 4-8, with the presentation you
selected in the right-hand pane. Scroll through the presentation to find the slide (or slides) you want to
import.
Figure 4-8. The presentation you're importing from appears in the box on the right.
Select a slide by turning on its checkbox, which adds the slide to the list on the left. To
deselect a slide, either turn off its checkbox or click the X by that slide's name in the
list. If you want to open a different presentation in the Import Slides box, click the
Change link (circled). You can import slides from just one presentation at a time.
2.
In the right-hand pane, select the slides you want to import by turning on the checkbox below each slide.
As you select slides, they appear in the list on the left side of the box.
3.
When you've chosen all the slides you want to import, click the Import button.
Docs imports the slides into your presentation. If you've chosen a theme for the current presentation
([click here]), the imported slide also has that theme.
4.

4.3.2.3.2. Import from your computer
You can also import a slide from a presentation that's currently on your computer. The process is a lot like
importing a slide from another Docs presentation, described in the previous section. In fact, the only difference
is in step 2: Instead of clicking the name of a Docs presentation in this step, click the Browse button, find and
select the presentation from which you want to import slides, and then click Upload. (Remember that Docs can
upload presentations up to 10 MB in size—see [click here].) Google uploads the presentation into Docs, and
then opens it in the Insert Slides box. Jump back into the steps for importing a slide at step 3.
When Docs imports the presentation so you can choose the slides you want, it also adds the presentation to
your Docs list. If you don't need the whole presentation in Docs, you can move it to the Trash. (Select the file
by turning on its checkbox, and then click the Delete button, which has a picture of a trash can on it.) On the
other hand, since Docs can hold a combined total of 5,000 documents and presentations, why not let it hang
around for a while?
4.3.2.4. Copy and Paste Slides
When you copy a slide, you can paste that copy anywhere you want: elsewhere in the same presentation or in
an entirely different presentation. You can also copy multiple slides at once.
You copy slides from the left-hand slide-sorter pane. Click the slide you want to copy to select it. (You can select
a range of slides by pressing Shift as you click, or noncontiguous slides by pressing the Ctrl [
] key as you click
the slides you want.) When you've selected what you want to copy, right-click (control-click), and then, from
the pop-up menu, choose "Copy slide".
Next, head to where you want to insert the copied slide or slides, whether that's in the current presentation or a
different one. In the slide-sorter pane, click the slide you want the copied slide(s) to appear after. (You can
always move slides around later, as the next section describes). Right-click (control-click), and then select
"Paste slide" to give the copied slide(s) a new home.
4.3.2.5. Move a Slide Within a Presentation
If you're the type of person who's always rearranging the living-room furniture, chances are you'll also want to
rearrange the slides in your presentation. Lucky for you, moving slides doesn't risk straining your back like
moving the couch does.
You use the slide-sorter pane to move slides within a presentation. Click the slide you want to move. When you
hover your cursor over that slide in the slide-sorter pane, the cursor changes to a grasping hand, as shown in
Figure 4-9. Drag to move the slide up or down. When the slide's where you want it, let go of the mouse button,
and the slide pops right into its new spot.
Figure 4-9. When the cursors changes to a grasping hand (as shown here), you can grab a slide and
drag it to a new location in the slide-sorter pane.

You can move more than one slide at a time. Select a group of slides by holding down the Shift key for a range,
or the Ctrl (
) key for nonadjacent slides. Move your cursor over any of the selected slides until it becomes a
grasping hand, and then click, drag, and drop. When you move several slides at the same time, Docs tells you
how many slides are in the group that you're moving by displaying the number in the slide-sorter pane.
If you prefer, you can move slides by selecting the slide(s) you want to move, and then right-clicking (control-
clicking) to bring up a menu. From there, choose "Move slide up" or "Move slide down", depending on which way
you want the slide(s) to go. Docs moves the slide(s) one spot at a time; repeat this process until your slides are
where you want them.

4.3.2.6. Delete a Slide
To chuck a slide out of your presentation, click the slide in either the slide-sorter or edit pane. Then click
"Delete slide" on the blue bar at the top of the page, or right-click (control-click) and select "Delete slide" from
the pop-up menu. Either way, the slide disappears.
NOTE
When you delete a slide, you can't click the formatting toolbar's Undo button ([click here]) to get your
slide back. Instead, when Docs deletes a slide, it puts up a notice with a mustard-colored background at
the top of the screen that reads "Deleted slide. Undo". Click the word "Undo" to bring the deleted slide
back.
4.3.3. Repositioning Elements on a Slide
The next couple of sections teach you how to insert and work with text ([click here]), shapes ([click here]), and
images ([click here]). As you pile different elements on a slide, you may need to adjust their position as they
overlap or obscure each other. For example, perhaps you want to lay some text over an image, but the image is
blocking out the text. In that case, you need to position the text on top of the image.
You can easily rearrange elements on a slide. When you right-click (control-click) a shape, image, or the border
of a text box ([click here]), the menu that appears gives you these options:
Delete. Removes the selected element from your slide.
Cut. Copies the selected element, and deletes it from your slide.
Copy. Copies the selected element.
Bring to Front. If you've got several elements stacked on top of each other, this option puts the one
you've chosen on top of the stack.
Send to Back. This option puts the chosen element at the bottom of the pile.
Bring Forward. This moves the chosen element one step forward. So if you've got four elements in a
stack and this one is number 3 in the pile, Bring Forward moves it up to number 2.
Send Backward. This does the opposite of Bring Forward, sending the chosen element back one place.

When you right-click (control-click) a shape, the menu that appears also includes
options for flipping the shape horizontally or vertically. For more on working with
shapes, see [click here].
4.3.4. Text: Adding, Editing, and Formatting
Whether you want to provide a bulleted list of campaign promises, outline the steps in an economic overhaul, or
summarize the shortcomings of your opponents, the meat of any presentation is its text. This section explains
how to insert and format text, so you can get those points across effectively.
4.3.4.1. Insert Text
When you create a new slide, you have a choice of layouts, as shown back in Figure 4-6. Except for Blank, all
these layouts have pre-formatted text boxes already inserted. These layouts represent the Greatest Hits for
most presentations you see today. You won't win any design awards for using them, but they get the job done
when it comes to conveying basic ideas.
Fortunately, you're not limited to those layouts—you can design your own. Say you want a slide with a photo on
the right and a bulleted list on the left. Just create a blank slide, insert the image ([click here]), insert the text
(explained next), and then move them around ([click here]) until everything's where you want it.
To put a new text box on a slide, click the "Insert text" button in the blue bar near the top of the screen (it has
a picture of a capital T on it). As Figure 4-10 shows, Docs inserts the text box in the middle of your slide. Click
inside the box, and then start typing. (If you don't like the current formatting, the next section tells you how to
change it.) When you're done typing, click outside the text box. If you want to edit what you've written, click
the text, and the box that holds it reappears; add more text or edit what's there.
Figure 4-10. Click "Insert text" (circled) to put a text box on a slide. Click inside the box and type
your text. Anytime you work with text, the box that holds it becomes visible. Drag the corners of a
text box (which are marked with white squares) to resize it.

4.3.4.2. Format Text
When you click a text box on a slide, you activate the formatting toolbar, shown in Figure 4-11, at the top of the
editing pane.
NOTE
When you're not actively working with a slide's text, the formatting toolbar gets grayed out as in Figure
4-1. Insert or click inside a text box to activate it.
Figure 4-11. Use the formatting toolbar to add some interest to your slides' text.

If you've worked with the Docs text editor (or just about any text editor, for that matter), these buttons will all
look familiar:
Undo. This button, which looks like an arrow curving to the left, reverses whatever you just did.
Redo. This button looks like an arrow curving to the right, and restores whatever you just undid.
Font. Not a lot of options here. Currently, your choices are Normal, Normal/serif, Courier New, Georgia,
Trebuchet, and Verdana. The drop-down menu shows your choices in the specified font.
NOTE
Hover your cursor over any of the formatting buttons to display a label that shows the button's
name.
Font size. In presentations, sizes range from 20 to 96 points.
Bold. Makes selected text bold.

Italic. Puts selected text in italics.
Underline. Underlines selected text.
Text color. Choose from a built-in palette. The rectangle under the A on this button shows the current
text color.
Highlighting. This highlights just the text you select (it doesn't fill in the background of the whole text
box). The palette you get to choose from is the same as for text color.
Link. You can link to Web pages or email addresses, but not to another slide within the presentation. (The
next section explains how to insert a link.)
Numbered list. If you click this button, each paragraph becomes an item in a numbered list. Right now,
numbers are the only option—you can't create a numbered list, and then turn the 1-2-3 into A-B-C, for
example.
Bulleted list. This button doesn't offer any choices for bullet styles—just basic black circles.
NOTE
Docs presentations don't support animation, so you can't have bullet points or numbered list items
appear on the slide one at a time. When a slide opens, it shows everything you've put on that
slide.
Decrease/increase indent. These buttons are helpful when you want to remove indentation to make
items in a list line up or include sub-bullets in a bulleted list.
Alignment. Click one of these three options for left-aligned, centered, or right-aligned text.
Remove formatting. Select some text, and then click this button to take away all its formatting.
4.3.4.3. Add a Hyperlink
You can create a link in a presentation that will open a specific Web page or open an email program with the
address of your choice in the To line. This is handy when you're going to post your presentation on the Web
([click here]) and you want to point to more info on another Web site or give viewers an easy way to get in
touch with you.

To add a hyperlink, select the text you want folks to click (like Email us!) and, in the formatting toolbar, click
Link. The Edit Link box, shown in Figure 4-12, opens with the text you selected in the "Text to display" box.
(This is the text that will appear on your slide for people to click.) Tell Docs whether you want viewers to be
sent to another Web page or to their email program by turning on the appropriate radio button.
Figure 4-12. In presentations, you can link to a Web page or an email address. At the moment, you
can't link to another slide within the presentation.
What you do next depends on the kind of link you chose:
Link to a Web page. Type or paste the URL (Web address) of the page you want the slide to link to. If
you want to make sure you got the address right, click "Test this link" to try it out.
Send an email. Type in the address that will receive emails.
If you're going to publish this presentation on the Web ([click here]), think twice
about including your email address. It's easy for spammers to find and exploit
published email address—and you probably don't want to get caught in a tidal
wave of spam.
When you've typed in what you want to link to, click OK, and Docs inserts the link into your slide.

4.3.4.4. Edit or Remove a Hyperlink
When you insert a link into a slide, the linked text turns blue and gets underlined to show that it's a link. You
can edit or remove a link when you show the slide in the editing pane. When you click the link, you see a box
that gives you three choices:
Go to link. This option shows the full URL of your link; click it to test it out.
Change. Click this option to open the Edit Link box, shown in Figure 4-12, where you can make changes
to the link.
Remove. Click this option to remove the link from the slide. (The text that was linked stays on your slide;
it just turns back into regular text.)
4.3.4.5. Move Text
When you click to insert a new text box ([click here]), Docs puts it smack in the middle of your slide. If that's
not where you want your text, you can move the box.
First, click inside the box to make its borders visible. Move your cursor to one of the borders so that it turns into
a four-way arrow, as shown in Figure 4-13. Then drag the text box to where you want it. Let up on the mouse
button to plant it in its new location.
Figure 4-13. When you can see a text box's borders, you can move or resize the box. To move it,
hover your cursor over a border so it becomes a four-way arrow (circled), and then drag it to where
you want it. To resize the box, drag one of the handles on its four corners (also circled).

4.3.4.6. Resize a Text Box
After putting various kinds of elements onto a slide—a chart, say, and some accompanying text—you'll probably
have to resize the text box to make things fit. Doing that is a snap: Just click the text so you see the borders of
the box that holds it. As Figure 4-13 shows, the text box has a little white square at each corner; each square is
a resizing handle. Put your cursor on a handle, and the cursor changes to a double-headed arrow. Now, just
drag to make the text box expand or contract. When the box is the size and dimensions you want, let up on the
mouse button. The text in the box automatically adjusts to its new confines.
4.3.4.7. Copy Text
To copy everything you've written inside a text box, including its formatting, in the editing pane, right-click
(control-click) the box's border. From the menu that appears, select Copy. Then, create a new slide or go to the
slide-sorter pane, and then select the slide you want to paste into, so it appears in the editing pane. Right-click
(control-click) the slide, and then select Paste. Docs pastes the copied text into the slide, in the same location it
occupied on the original.
4.3.4.8. Check Your Spelling
Currently, there's no spell checker in the Docs presentation editor. Even if you've installed the Google Toolbar
([click here]), you might not want to use its spell check button on your slides, because you have to check
spelling in each text box individually. It gets worse: When the Toolbar finds a spelling error, it marks the word
by changing its font in the slide (making the word bold, underlined, and red)—so you have to correct the
spelling error and reformat the corrected word. Needless to say, this method is more trouble than it's worth.
Bad spellers: Don't give up hope just yet. If you use Firefox 2, or later, you can use its built-in spell check
feature. To turn it on, select Tools
Options
Advanced
General, turn on "Check my spelling as I type",
and then click OK. If you use Firefox on a Mac, choose Firefox
Preferences
Advanced
General. In
Firefox 2, you can also right-click (control-click) a field, and then, from the pop-up menu, select "Spell check

this field".
Alternatively, you can export your presentation's text ([click here]) and put it into a word processing program
that checks spelling. Sometimes, though, there's no substitute for a good, old-fashioned proofreader. Find
someone who's good at spelling and invite him to collaborate ([click here]) on the presentation.
4.3.4.9. Delete Text
If you just want to delete a word or two, while keeping the rest of the text intact, do so in the usual way—using
your keyboard's Backspace or Delete key. But if you try to get rid of a text box this way, it doesn't quite work.
The text disappears, but the box is still there, helpfully suggesting that you click to add some content.
To delete a text box (and everything in it) in one fell swoop, click the text so you can see the box's borders.
Place your cursor on a border (it'll turn into a four-way arrow, as shown in Figure 4-13), right-click (control-
click), and then select Delete.
NOTE
When Docs deletes a text box (or other element) from a slide, it displays a mustard-colored message
near the top of your screen to tell you that it just deleted something. If you didn't mean to delete it, click
the Undo link that's part of the message, and Docs restores what you deleted.
4.3.5. Adding Shapes and Images
When properly used, images and shapes add interest and impact to your slides. You can illustrate sales trends
with a chart, insert arrows to show workflow or cause and effect, and add photos to show products or dramatize
a situation. This section tells you how to work with shapes and images in a Docs presentation.
NOTE
You can't animate elements on Docs presentation slides. So if you're used to having shapes and images
come pin-wheeling or spiraling in, you might be a little disappointed. On the bright side, not playing
around with animation means you'll get your work done faster.
4.3.5.1. Insert a Shape
Docs presentations offer you a very basic range of shapes to choose from, as Figure 4-14 shows. At this writing,
you can't compose your own custom shapes, so you have to make do with Google's built-in rectangles, ellipses,
speech bubbles, starbursts, and arrows.
To insert a shape, in the blue bar above the editing pane, click the "Insert shape" button. A menu opens, giving
you the choices shown in Figure 4-14.

You can also add YouTube videos to your presentations. In the blue bar above the edit
pane, click "Insert video". Google opens a box where you can search YouTube videos by
keyword. Find the one you want and click it to select it. Then click the Insert Video
button to put the video on your slide. Once it's there, you can move, resize, or delete it,
just like any image or shape. During a slideshow, viewers can play the video by clicking
the Play button on its slide.
Figure 4-14. Choose a shape from the "Insert shape" menu (circled). After you've made your
selection, you can format, move, or resize the shape.
4.3.5.2. Format a Shape
When you click a shape on a slide, the editing pane's toolbar changes to give you the following options:
Fill color. Click this button, which looks like a tilted paint can, to choose a color to fill the shape.
Outline color and size. Use this button, which looks like a pencil, to create an outline for your shape.
You can control two aspects of the outline:
Weight. How thick do you want the outline to be? Choose from 1 to 6 points.

Color. Choose a color for the outline.
4.3.5.3. Insert an Image
Nothing can kill your audience's attention more quickly than a sea of text on your slides. Whenever you get a
chance, spruce things up with illustrations, photos, or charts and graphs. (Keep in mind that images on Web
sites are most likely copyrighted, so you can't use them without permission.)
If you're inserting a really big image or photo, resize the image using image-editing
software, like Photoshop, before you upload it.
To put an image on a slide, follow these easy steps:
Figure 4-15. Tell Google where to find the image you want to insert. If you're transferring an image
from a Web site (make sure you have permission to use it), put the two browser windows side by
side, and then click the image and drag it onto your slide.
Open the slide in the editing pane, and then click "Insert image".
Docs opens the Insert Image box, shown in Figure 4-15. From here, you can insert a picture that's on your
computer or lives somewhere on the Web.
1.

Tell Google where to find the image. If it's on your computer, click the Browse button, and then locate and
select the image you want. If it's on the Web, enter (or copy and paste) the image's URL (Web address).
Then click OK.
Ta-da! The image appears on your slide. Now you can move or resize it, as explained in the next two
sections.
2.
If you've got image files stored on the Web, then you can drag the image onto your
slide. Open the image in a new browser window, and then resize the windows so you can
see both Docs and the image-storing site. Click and drag the image into the Docs editing
pane, and then release the mouse button. Docs imports the image and puts it on your
slide. This method doesn't yet work 100 percent of the time, but it's so easy that it's
worth a try.
Workaround Workshop: Give Your Image a Border
At this writing, Docs doesn't have any formatting buttons for working with images in presentations
(the formatting toolbars are only for text and shapes). If you're used to working in PowerPoint,
you probably miss the ability to easily throw a border around an image to distinguish it from a
slide's background. However, you have a couple of ways to create borders for images in your
presentations:
Before you upload the image. Open the image in your favorite image-editing program,
and put a border around it there. Save the image, and when you upload it into your
presentation, the image has the border you created.
After you upload the image. If you've already inserted an image and decide it needs a
border, click "Insert shape", and then choose the rectangle. Resize ([click here]) the
rectangle so it's just a teensy bit bigger than the image, and then click the Outline button
and create a border ([click here]) for the rectangle. Place the image on top of the rectangle
(right-click and select Send Backward or Bring Forward as needed—see [click here]), and the
rectangle's border becomes the image's border.
4.3.5.4. Move a Shape or Image
To move a shape or an image after you've placed it on a slide, all you have to do is drag and drop. When you
move your cursor over an image on a slide, the cursor changes to a four-way arrow. That arrow is your signal
that you can now click and drag to move the image to a new spot on the slide.
4.3.5.5. Resize a Shape or Image
This process is just like resizing a text box ([click here]). When you click any element on a slide, resizing
handles (little white squares you can drag) appear at its four corners. Place your cursor over any handle so it
turns into a double-headed arrow, and then drag to resize the shape. Let go of the mouse button when the
shape or image is the size you want.

To preserve the proportions of the shape when you're resizing it—so your square doesn't
turn into a rectangle, for example—hold down the Shift key as you drag the handle.
4.3.5.6. Delete a Shape or Image
Deleting shapes and images couldn't be easier. Just open the slide in the editing pane, right-click (control-click)
the image or shape, and then, from the menu that appears, select "Delete". (To get your shape or image back,
click Undo in the mustard-yellow notice that appeared at the top of your screen after you deleted.)
 

 
4.4. Previewing a Presentation
It's always good practice to rehearse your slideshow before sharing it with the rest of the world. It's your best
chance to do things like weed out inconsistencies between slides, add missing labels to charts, and fix typos.
To preview a presentation, all you need to do is click the upper-right "Start presentation" link. (This link is the
same one you click when you're giving the presentation online—see [click here].) A new browser window opens,
showing the first slide of the presentation. To navigate through the slides, use the arrows in the lower-left part
of the screen. When you've finished previewing the slides, just close the window.
 

 
4.5. Printing a Presentation
It never hurts to have a paper copy in hand as you present a slideshow—it may not be fancy, but a backup
printout has saved more than a few presenters' bacon since the Dawn of PowerPoint. Printouts also make for
good handouts if you're looking for something to leave behind for your audience.
To print a Docs presentation, you first have to convert the presentation to a PDF, and then print the PDF file.
Here's how:
Open the presentation you want to print, and then click File
Print. (If you're viewing the presentation
as explained in the previous section, click the lower-right "Print slides" link.)
The Print Preview box, shown in Figure 4-16, opens.
Figure 4-16. Click the drop-down menu under Layout (circled) to tell Docs how many
slides to print on each page; the preview pane on the left side of the box reflects your
selection. To prevent a distracting background from appearing in your printed slides,
turn off the "Show background" checkbox.
1.

Choose the layout you want.
What you pick here determines how many slides appear on each printed sheet. You can print just one slide
per page, or as many as a dozen on each page. If you've applied a theme ([click here]) or background
image ([click here]) to your slides, you can tell Docs not to print the background by turning off the "Show
background" checkbox. (Busy backgrounds can make printed slides hard to read.) When you've got your
pages looking good, click Print.
Turning off the "Show background" checkbox doesn't change the formatting of text
or other elements, just the background. If your presentation's theme has white
text on a black background, for instance, turning off "Show background" prints
white text on a white background—not exactly legible. When your slides have a
busy or dark-colored background, you're better off changing the presentation's
theme ([click here]) to Blank before you print. The Blank theme puts black text on
a white background, so you save toner, and the printed slides are much easier to
read.
2.
Google converts the image to a PDF. Your browser opens a download dialog box, asking what to do with
the file: Open or save it. Tell it to open the PDF in Adobe Reader, and then click OK.
Adobe Reader shows you what the printed slides will look like, and your browser opens a Print box. You
can print the presentation from your browser or close the Print box and print from Adobe Reader.
3.
Make sure the settings are the way you want them, and then click OK.
Your presentation heads to the printer.
4.
 

 
4.6. Deleting a Presentation
Google Docs can hold a lot of presentations—up to 5,000 documents and slideshows total, to be exact. Even so,
you might want to delete an old presentation when you know you won't need it again. Google lets you perform
your housecleaning either from the Docs home page or from the presentation editor:
From the Docs list. On the Docs home page, find the file you want to delete. (To make it easier to find,
look in the left-hand menu under "Items by Type"—click the + sign if necessary—and select
Presentations.) Select the slideshow by turning on its checkbox, and then click the Delete button with the
picture of a trash can on it.
From an open presentation. If you're looking at a presentation and decide it's gotta go, select File
"Delete presentation". Docs opens a confirmation box to make sure you really want to delete it; click OK.
NOTE
When a presentation is in the Trash, you can restore it to the Docs list by picking Trash in the Docs
list, selecting the presentation, and then clicking Undelete. But if you really, really want that file
gone for good, open the Trash folder, select the presentation, and click Empty Trash. Doing so gets
rid of the presentation you selected but leaves other trashed files in place.
 

 
4.7. Sharing and Collaborating on Presentations
Presentations are made to share—and with Google Docs, you can share 'em with a whole group of people all at
once. Whether you're presenting a lecture for a class, action items for a business meeting, or photos of your
family vacation, Google is redefining how people share and present information.
Docs gives you several ways to share your slideshow: You can publish it on the Web, invite colleagues to jump
in and work on it with you, or get the whole gang together to view it simultaneously. For example, you could
have a group gathered around the conference table in the home office watching the presentation projected on a
screen, while people on the road can watch it on their computers. After the meeting, you can post the
presentation on the Web for anyone who missed it. This section teaches you how to do all those things and
more.
4.7.1. Publishing a Presentation
When you publish a presentation, Docs sets you up with a dedicated Web page for your slideshow. Anyone who
has the URL (Web address) can either view the slides on their own or join an online presentation while it's
happening and chat ([click here]) with others who are viewing it, too.
Publishing a presentation is similar to publishing a document or spreadsheet. To get started, open your
presentation, and then click the Publish tab. If you haven't yet published a presentation, there's only one button
on this tab: "Publish document". Click it, and Docs puts your presentation on the Web, marking it in your Docs
list as Published.
4.7.1.1. Share a published presentation
When you've published a presentation, the Publish tab changes to look like the one in Figure 4-17. The left side
of the page gives the URL of your presentation's Web page. Copy this link and paste it into an email if you like.
Figure 4-17. On the left side of the Publish tab is the URL of the published presentation, along with
some HTML you can use to embed the presentation in a Web page or blog. (An embedded slideshow
appears in a mini-viewer like the one on the right.) Click "Stop publishing" (circled) if you want to
take the published presentation off the Web.

4.7.1.2. Embed a presentation
It's great to have a special page on the Web to display your presentation. But what if you'd rather display the
slideshow right there on your own Web site, so viewers can click through it without leaving your site? No
problem: Embed the presentation in a page on your site.
When you embed a presentation, you insert a little snippet of HTML code into your Web page (or blog). The Web
page then displays the slideshow in a mini-viewer, like the one shown in Figure 4-17. People who view an
embedded presentation can scroll through it or even embed it in a page of their own. If you're a little nervous
about using HTML, don't worry—Docs tells you exactly what to insert in your page.
On the left side of the Publish tab is a text box stuffed with some HTML (as shown in Figure 4-17). Just copy the
code, paste it into an HTML page, and then upload that page to your Web site or blog.
The right side of the Publish tab previews what the mini-viewer will look like once you've posted it. Viewers can
click the arrows in the lower-left part of the mini-viewer's frame to move through the slides. They can click
Google Docs to go to your Google Docs account, or click Menu to access the presentation in Google Docs. (When
someone clicks Menu, the mini-viewer changes to look like the one in Figure 4-18. Clicking the link to the
presentation just below the slide opens a new window, with the presentation displayed in the presentation
editor.) If they want to see the HTML code and embed this presentation in another Web page, they can click
Menu.
NOTE
Only collaborators on a presentation ([click here]) can access an embedded presentation in the
spreadsheet editor.

Figure 4-18. When someone viewing an embedded presentation clicks the Menu button (circled), the
mini-viewer's contents change. People who have permission to collaborate on your presentation can
go straight to it in Google Docs by clicking the presentation's name (also circled). To the right of the
slide is the HTML that people can use to embed the presentation in their own Web pages.
4.7.1.3. Take a published presentation off the Web
If you want to remove a slideshow from the Web, open the file, and then click the Publish tab. You see a page
like the one shown back in Figure 4-17. Click "Stop publishing", and Google does just that.
4.7.2. Sharing a Presentation
When you click a presentation's Share tab, the result looks exactly like the Share This Document page in a Docs
word processing document (see [click here]). In fact, the whole process for inviting viewers and collaborators to
share a presentation is almost exactly the same for presentations as it is for documents. To find out how to
share a presentation, flip back to [click here]. To learn the difference between viewers and collaborators in
Google Docs, check out [click here].
You can add notes to your slides to share with viewers during a presentation. As you
work on the presentation, click inside the right-hand Speaker Notes pane, and then type
any notes you want to go with the slide. During a presentation, viewers can click a "View
speaker notes" link to open the notes in a new window.
When you share a presentation, as opposed to a document, the only difference you'll find is that when you invite
viewers or collaborators to share a presentation, you have to send them an invitation email. (With documents,
you can skip sending the invitation and just add people to your Viewers or Collaborators list—see the Note on

[click here].)
NOTE
If you're using Google Docs through your organization's Google Apps account (see Chapter 10), you may
find that you can't share presentations with just anyone. You might be able to share only with people in
your organization—in other words, you can only send sharing invites to people with email addresses like
joe@yourcompany.com or tina@yournonprofit.org.
4.7.2.1. Email a shared presentation
If you've done some work on a presentation and want to alert its viewers and collaborators to the latest
changes, click the slideshow's upper-right Email link. This opens the Email Presentation window, shown in Figure
4-19.
Figure 4-19. Use this window to let viewers and collaborators know about changes to a presentation.
Add or remove recipients by turning on or off the checkboxes next to their names. Clicking All or
None (circled) turn all the checkboxes on or off with one click. When collaborators are working on a
presentation at the same time you are, their names appear in the lower-right part of the page (also
circled).
The Email Presentation window shows the names of everyone you've shared with (including you, the

presentation's owner). If you want to take someone off the email notification list, turn off the checkbox next to
that person's name. If you want to send the email to just one or two people out of a long list of recipients, click
None to turn off all the checkboxes, and then mark those you want by hand.
The Subject line automatically contains the name of the presentation, but you can change it. You can also add
an optional message in the Message box—an explanation of the changes you made, for instance. The email
includes a link to the presentation so recipients can see it with a click. When everything looks good, click Send
to shoot off your email.
4.7.3. Viewing a Presentation
You've worked hard on your presentation and now it's time for the real thing: sharing your work with others
over the Web. You, and the people on your Viewers list or your Collaborators list, can access the presentation at
the same time right from Google Docs. Just open the presentation, and then click the upper-right "Start
presentation" link.
A new browser window opens, looking something like Figure 4-20. This window is where you present the
slideshow. Everyone who's signed in starts on a page that looks similar to this one.
Figure 4-20. When you start a presentation, it looks like this page. Use the lower-left arrows
(circled) to navigate through the slides. The right side of the page shows who's viewing it and gives
them a chat box to discuss the presentation online. If you don't need the chat box, hide it by clicking
the tiny, right-pointing arrow (circled) in its left border. (See [click here] for more about hiding the
chat box.)
When someone receives your invitation to participate ([click here]), he gets to the slideshow by clicking a link in
the invitation email or by opening the presentation from his Docs list, and then clicking "Start presentation". His
name appears in the Audience list on the right side of the page, so you know who's there as people arrive.

During the presentation, viewers can click through the slides at their own pace, using the arrows on the lower-
left part of the screen, or they can follow the presenter. (For more about who gets to lead a presentation, see
the next section.) If a viewer strays from what's on the presenter's screen, a notice appears in the upper-right
part of that viewer's screen, above the audience box, that looks like the one in Figure 4-21. The person can click
the "Follow the presenter" link to get back in sync with the presentation.
Figure 4-21. Audience members can follow the presenter (so their screens show the slide that's
currently on the presenter's screen), or view slides at their own pace. In this example, a viewer is
looking at slide 3 (circled, lower left), while the presenter is on slide 1 (circled, upper right). To get
back in sync with the rest of the audience, the viewer can click the "Follow the presenter" link.
During the slideshow, audience members can chat in the right-hand chat box. For more about chatting, jump
ahead to [click here].
Windows users: To switch your presentation to full-screen mode (and back again), hit
the F11 key.
Viewers can also print your slides right from the presentation. They just click the lower-right "print slides" link,
and then follow the printing process ([click here]).
4.7.3.1. Take control of the presentation
If you're in charge of the presentation, you probably want your audience to follow along as you speak (or chat).
To make sure that everyone's on the same page—er, slide—you can take control of the presentation. That

sounds like a major grab for power, but all it really means is that the audience sees the same slide that's on
your screen. That way, when you click from slide 1 to slide 2, everybody else sees slide 2 on their screens, too.
To take the lead in a presentation, simply click the "Take control of presentation" button above the Audience list
(you can see it in Figure 4-20).
Google's awfully democratic about who gets to lead a presentation. Anyone on your Collaborators list can take
control of the presentation at any time. (Viewers can't control a presentation, but they can choose to follow the
presenter or go through at their own pace, and participate in chat, as explained in the next section.) For
example, if George, a collaborator, isn't quite finished with slide 14 when you've moved on to slide 15, he can
grab control of the presentation and move everyone back to slide 14. All George has to do is click the "Take
control of presentation" link above the Audience list, and he becomes the presenter. Then, when he clicks the
back arrow, everyone following the presentation goes back to slide 14.
NOTE
If you invite someone to the presentation but don't add him to your Collaborators list, Google
automatically treats him as a viewer.
Of course, you don't have to take that from George. (Why did you invite that pushy guy to collaborate, anyway?
) When George takes control of the presentation, the "Take control of presentation" link appears on your screen.
Click that link to resume control and get your presentation back on track.
When you're in control of the presentation, you can relinquish the lead at any time. Click the "Stop presenting"
link above the Audience list. When you click "Stop presenting", you can scroll forward or backward through your
slides, and it doesn't affect what audience members see on their screens.
4.7.3.2. Chat while viewing a presentation
One of the cool things about sharing Docs presentations online is that, when you view a presentation, a chat
window opens automatically, letting viewers make comments, paste in links, and even goof around with
animated smiley faces during the show. As you can see back in Figure 4-20, the chat box appears on the right-
hand side of the page.
NOTE
The Docs presentation chat is powered by Google Talk (Chapter 6). For Google Talk to work, you need
Adobe Flash version 8 or higher. (Linux users need Flash 9.) You can download the latest version of Flash
for free from www.adobe.com/go/getflashplayer.
To chat, type your comment in the text box below the chat area (next to the happy-face button). If you want,
click the happy-face button to insert one of a range of different smileys, expressing just about any emotion you

can think of. When you've finished typing you comment, hit Enter, and your comment appears in the chat area.
Anyone who's viewing the presentation can see your comment and respond with a comment of her own.
4.7.3.2.1. Copy & paste into chat
You can copy and paste all kinds of things into the chat box—text, links, even videos and images from YouTube,
Google Videos, Picasa, or Flickr. Docs' chat feature can even recognize certain URLs as video or image files, and
insert them right into the chat area.
The chat window uses Google Talk, which runs on Adobe's Flash software. Thanks to a Flash quirk, copying and
pasting into chat may be a little different from what you're used to. To copy something to paste into the chat
area, you've gotta slow things down a bit and follow this one-key-at-a-time sequence to copy:
On a Mac: Press the 
 key and hold it down while pressing C. Then, let go of the C key. Last of all, let go
of the 
 key.
On a PC: Press and hold Ctrl, and then press C. Let go of C, and then let go of Ctrl.
To paste into chat, the procedure is similar:
On a Mac: Press and hold the 
 key, and then press V. Then let go of V, and then let go of the 
 key.
On a PCs: Press and hold Ctrl, and then press V. Next, let go of V, and then let go of Ctrl.
4.7.3.2.2. Hide the chat box
You might find that chatting during a presentation is more distracting than productive. Or you might not need
the chat box at all—if, say, you're on a conference call to talk about the slides or you're hooked up to a
projector to show the presentation to a group of folks who are all in the same room.
You can hide the chat box using the gray border to the left of the chat area. If you look really closely, you can
see a tiny, right-pointing arrow in this border; it's circled in Figure 4-20. Click the arrow (or anywhere in the
border), and the right pane disappears, as shown in Figure 4-22: no chat area, no audience list, no link to take
control of the presentation.
Figure 4-22. When you hide the chat area, your slideshow takes up the full window. To bring the
chat area back, click the gray bar at the right edge of the window, where there's a tiny left-pointing
arrow (circled).

When you hide the chat area, it doesn't go away entirely. Others who are viewing the presentation on their
screens can still chat on their computers; you just won't see their comments. You can make the chat area
visible again by clicking the gray border at the far right of the screen. (Its teensy arrow is now pointing left.)
When you do, the chat area reappears.
 

 
4.8. Turn Back Time: Your Presentation's Revision History
As with spreadsheets and documents, Google Docs autosaves your presentations and lists the various versions
on the Revisions tab, shown in Figure 4-23. (Docs calls each saved version a revision.)
Figure 4-23. The Revisions tab (circled) lists all the different versions of your presentation that
Google has saved. Click any revision number to view that revision.
On the Revisions tab, each saved version of your presentation has these parts:
Revision number. Docs numbers each revision it saves, starting with 0 when the presentation is created.
The most recent revision has the highest number.
Last edited. This column tells you who edited the revision, and when.
Changes. This column gives you an idea of what kind of changes that particular revision recorded. If an
autosave recorded no changes (maybe you turned away from the open presentation while you took a
phone call), this column tells you that, too.
NOTE
Instead of appearing individually on the page, some presentations get gathered up into groups,
shown by a link on the list's right side. To see a list of those revisions, click the link.

To view a revision, click its revision number. A new window opens, displaying all the slides of that
revision—scroll down the page to see them.
NOTE
Unlike Docs word processing documents, when you're working with presentations, you can't compare two
versions or page from one version to the next when viewing a revision.
4.8.1. Revert to a previous version
Because a revision captures the presentation as it was 20 minutes or 8 hours or 3 days ago, you can't edit a
revision. You can, however, make any revision the current version of the presentation, and then edit it:
On the Revisions tab, find the presentation you want, and then click its revision number.
Docs opens that version in a new window.
1.
Make sure this is the version you want to switch to, and then click the "Revert to this version" button.
Docs asks you to confirm that you really want to make this old version the current one.
2.
Click OK.
Docs makes this revision the current version of the presentation. You can close the window where you
viewed the revision. and then, in the presentation editor, go to work on it.
3.

Chapter 5. Gmail: Email Google-Style
When Google introduced Gmail in 2004, it set the Internet buzzing about its revolutionary approach to Web-
based email. What's so different about Gmail?
Massive amounts of storage—for free. Back in 2004, most Web-based email programs offered maybe
a couple of megabytes of storage. (If you wanted more, you could buy it.) Gmail roared onto the scene
with a full gigabyte of storage—that's 1,000 megabytes (enough space to store 500,000 pages of
email)—and it didn't cost a cent. And Google keeps adding more space. As of early 2008, Gmail was
offering over six gigabytes of free storage.
A new way of organizing your messages. Most email programs use folders to organize your email.
This works pretty well—until you're trying to find a particular message and you can't remember which
folder you stuck it in. Instead of folders, Google has introduced two innovations for organizing your email:
labels and conversations. Labels are colored identifiers you can add to email messages to make them easy
to find. You can sort by labels, create a filter to label messages automatically, and even stick more than
one label on a message. Gmail also keeps back-and-forth email replies together in conversations, making
it easy to find a particular email within the context of a larger dialog.
Excellent searching ability. Google applied its searching expertise to email, making it a snap to zero in
on any email you've ever sent or received—fast. You can even fine-tune your search criteria to make
searching more efficient.
Google's added more features to Gmail since then, and opened it up so everyone can get an account (originally,
it was by invitation only). This chapter explains all Gmail's features and offers tips and tricks to make you a
Gmail power user in no time flat.
5.1. Welcome to Gmail: A Quick Tour
Before you can start sending and receiving emails with Gmail, you have to sign up for an account, of course.
The simplest method is to start with a (free) Google Account (see Chapter 1 for details on how to activate this
essential passport to most of Google's offerings).

NOTE
In Google's eyes, there's a difference between your all-encompassing Google Account and the Gmail
account you set up to actually use their email service. In a nutshell, the first gets you access to all of
Google's apps and services, while the second mainly consists of the email address and password you
need to get your email.
Once you've logged into your Google Accounts page (www.google.com/accounts), head to the "Try something
new" section, and click the Gmail link. Or you can go straight to Gmail (www.gmail.com or mail.google.com)
and try signing in using your Google Account user name and password. If you haven't already done so, choose a
Gmail address (like your.name@gmail.com—see the following Note for tips about picking a Gmail address), and
select and answer a security question (in case you forget your password). Optionally, you can add a secondary
email address to your Gmail account—helpful if you forget your password (this text box is prefilled if your
Google Account already lists a secondary email address—see [click here]). When you're done filling out this
abbreviated sign-up form, click Continue to get Gmail up and running.
NOTE
Although you can use periods in your Gmail address, Gmail doesn't actually recognize periods—it treats
the login name exactly the same with or without the periods. So if your Gmail address is
jessesmith@gmail.com, email sent to jesse.smith@gmail.com or even j.e.s.s.e.s.m.i.t.h@gmail.com will
still reach you. (You might put periods in to make the name easier to read or to avoid awkward
abbreviations; for example, Lori Over might prefer l.over@gmail.com to lover@gmail.com.) Make your
login name simple and easy to remember, like FirstNameLastName or InitialsLastName.
Frequently Asked Question: Gmail and Security
Is using Web-based email secure?
It seems like there's always a news story about security problems and the Internet: viruses,
worms, identity theft, hackers stealing sensitive data—the list goes on. It's enough to make you
wonder: Is it safe to use a Web-based email account like Gmail? The last thing you need is
someone hacking into your account and reading your email.
A Web page is secure when it encrypts the information it sends. That means that, instead of
transmitting words a person could read, the page scrambles the content into a kind of code before
sending it, foiling any would-be spies. (The scrambled info gets unscrambled once it reaches its
destination—a friend's email inbox, say.)
You can tell whether a Web page is secure by the letters at the beginning of the page's address in
your browser's address bar: https means a secure connection that encrypts your data and protects
your privacy. ("Https" is short for "hypertext transfer protocol over secure sockets layer"—don't
ask). That s on the end is important, because it distinguishes the address from plain old http,
which means the page isn't secure. ("Http" stands for "hypertext transfer protocol.")

Here's some good news: Gmail offers the most secure free, Web-based email out there. Whenever
you log in to Gmail, you log in through a secure connection. (Type gmail.com into your browser,
and Google takes you to a page with a long URL that starts with https.) That means Gmail
scrambles your password so nobody can pluck it out of the air and steal it.
After you log in, Gmail takes you to a plain ol' http version of the site. But if you're really security-
minded (or if you're in a coffee shop using a public wireless network and you're not too sure about
that geeky-looking kid in the corner, typing away at his laptop and cackling), Gmail offers a secure
connection so that everything to do with your Gmail account gets encrypted. To beef up your
Gmail security, use this URL to log into Gmail: https://mail.google.com (don't forget the s in
"https"). If you're already in the middle of a Gmail session, just type that address into your
browser's address bar to get a secure connection.
One drawback to using a secure connection is that it might slow Gmail down a bit. Browsers don't
store https pages in their caches (where a Web browser keeps info about the Web sites you visit
so it can load them more quickly). So whenever you move from one page to another within Gmail,
your browser has to reload all the code that makes Gmail work. Sometimes, though, the slight
delay is worth it to make sure your data's secure.
You can also access Gmail from a cellphone or other mobile device. Start up your
phone's browser, and then point it to http://gmail.com to sign in.
5.1.1. The Gmail Workspace
When you sign into your Gmail account for the first time—via www.gmail.com—you see a workspace that looks
like the one in Figure 5-1. This is your Gmail home base, your launch pad from which you can read and compose
email, manage contacts, and more.
Figure 5-1. Whenever you sign into Gmail, you go straight to your inbox, where you see any new
emails. Other mailboxes—like special ones dedicated to items like sent mail and spam —also appear
on the left. Other choices on the left side include a Compose Mail link and a Contacts link (for your
address book). To change your Gmail settings ([click here]), click the upper-right Settings link
(circled).

The center of the window displays whatever's of interest at the moment: When you first sign into Gmail, it
shows the contents of your inbox. If you're typing an email, this is where you type. If you want to manage your
contacts, the list appears here.
Use the links on the left-hand side of the page to select your task:
Compose Mail. Click this link when you want to write a fresh, new email; details start on [click here].
Mailboxes. There's no heading here that says "Mailboxes", but this is a list of the mailboxes in your
account:
Inbox. Your Gmail inbox displays a list of recent emails, with the newest one at the top.
Starred. When you receive an important, must-remember message, you can add a star to it by
clicking the little white star to the left of the sender's name. Gmail turns the star gold and stores a
pointer to the email in this mailbox.
Chats. If you use Google Talk for chats (see Chapter 6), then you can choose to save your chat

history here.
If you don't want to save your chat history in Gmail, then you need to adjust
your settings; [click here] tells you how.
Sent Mail. If you ever have troubling remembering what you wrote to whom, this mailbox helps
keep you straight. Messages you've sent appear here, starting at the top with the most recent.
Drafts. If you start an email but don't send it, Gmail stores it here. (See [click here] for more on
drafts.)
All Mail. Just what it sounds like. All your mail—received, sent, in-progress—appears in this
mailbox.
Spam. When something that looks like spam arrives in your Gmail account, Gmail stores it in this
mailbox. You can check your Spam mailbox once in a while to see if anything legit got snagged as
spam. Gmail is pretty darn good at distinguishing spam from real email, though, so you don't have
to worry about this too much. Gmail deletes any messages that sit in your Spam mailbox for more
than 30 days.
Trash. Ever toss an important note into the trash, only to have to dig it out later? In Gmail, if you
trash a message, Gmail stores it here for 30 days—just in case. If you need it later, you can find
it—with a lot less mess than digging through the garbage can.
Contacts. Click this link to get to Gmail's version of an address book. It lists people you've contacted with
your Gmail account. To read more about contacts and how to manage them, flip to [click here].
The left-hand menu covers most of what you'll want to do with Gmail. But in the central workspace, you can
easily read or search messages, and manage your email. Keep reading to learn how.

Frequently Asked Question: Gmail and Targeted Advertising
I've heard that Google scans all Gmail messages so they can display ads relating to the email's
content. Is Google invading my privacy?
When Google announced Gmail back in 2004, there was quite a bit of controversy about Google's
plan to insert context-sensitive ads in Gmail messages. Context-sensitive is industry-speak for a
process whereby Gmail scans your emails, looks for keywords, and then pairs the email with
advertising that relates to those keywords. For example, if a friend writes to you about her
mountain-biking vacation in the Rockies, when you open her email, you see ads for things like
mountain lodges, Rocky Mountain vacation spots, bicycle retailers, and so on. Usually, one ad's
displayed above the message you're reading, and several others are on the right-hand side of the
page. The ads are so unobtrusive that you can easily ignore them. But does context-sensitive
advertising invade your privacy?
You might feel a little more comfortable knowing that none of that scanning is done by human
eyes, so nobody actually reads your emails. And scanning incoming email isn't an unusual
practice; all email services regularly scan incoming messages to watch for viruses, spam, and so
on.
Gmail also tries to keep things tasteful. Emails that mention sex, for example, don't display ads for
porn sites. And if you receive an email about a tragedy, such as a death in the family, Gmail,
thank goodness, doesn't display any ads at all.
One other thing to know: Unlike other free, Web-based email providers, Gmail doesn't stick ads on
your outgoing emails (for now, anyway). Both Hotmail and Yahoo Mail, for example, tack an ad
onto the end of each and every email you send from their accounts. (These ads have nothing to do
with the email's content, though.)
If the idea of a computer scanning your incoming emails and matching them up with ads bothers
you, don't use Gmail. On the other hand, Gmail's ads are easy to ignore. And who knows—you
might find an occasional targeted ad useful. In that case, all you have to do is click its link, and
your Web browser opens the ad in a new window.

your browser has to reload all the code that makes Gmail work. Sometimes, though, the slight
delay is worth it to make sure your data's secure.
You can also access Gmail from a cellphone or other mobile device. Start up your
phone's browser, and then point it to http://gmail.com to sign in.
5.1.1. The Gmail Workspace
When you sign into your Gmail account for the first time—via www.gmail.com—you see a workspace that looks
like the one in Figure 5-1. This is your Gmail home base, your launch pad from which you can read and compose
email, manage contacts, and more.
Figure 5-1. Whenever you sign into Gmail, you go straight to your inbox, where you see any new
emails. Other mailboxes—like special ones dedicated to items like sent mail and spam —also appear
on the left. Other choices on the left side include a Compose Mail link and a Contacts link (for your
address book). To change your Gmail settings ([click here]), click the upper-right Settings link
(circled).

The center of the window displays whatever's of interest at the moment: When you first sign into Gmail, it
shows the contents of your inbox. If you're typing an email, this is where you type. If you want to manage your
contacts, the list appears here.
Use the links on the left-hand side of the page to select your task:
Compose Mail. Click this link when you want to write a fresh, new email; details start on [click here].
Mailboxes. There's no heading here that says "Mailboxes", but this is a list of the mailboxes in your
account:
Inbox. Your Gmail inbox displays a list of recent emails, with the newest one at the top.
Starred. When you receive an important, must-remember message, you can add a star to it by
clicking the little white star to the left of the sender's name. Gmail turns the star gold and stores a
pointer to the email in this mailbox.
Chats. If you use Google Talk for chats (see Chapter 6), then you can choose to save your chat

history here.
If you don't want to save your chat history in Gmail, then you need to adjust
your settings; [click here] tells you how.
Sent Mail. If you ever have troubling remembering what you wrote to whom, this mailbox helps
keep you straight. Messages you've sent appear here, starting at the top with the most recent.
Drafts. If you start an email but don't send it, Gmail stores it here. (See [click here] for more on
drafts.)
All Mail. Just what it sounds like. All your mail—received, sent, in-progress—appears in this
mailbox.
Spam. When something that looks like spam arrives in your Gmail account, Gmail stores it in this
mailbox. You can check your Spam mailbox once in a while to see if anything legit got snagged as
spam. Gmail is pretty darn good at distinguishing spam from real email, though, so you don't have
to worry about this too much. Gmail deletes any messages that sit in your Spam mailbox for more
than 30 days.
Trash. Ever toss an important note into the trash, only to have to dig it out later? In Gmail, if you
trash a message, Gmail stores it here for 30 days—just in case. If you need it later, you can find
it—with a lot less mess than digging through the garbage can.
Contacts. Click this link to get to Gmail's version of an address book. It lists people you've contacted with
your Gmail account. To read more about contacts and how to manage them, flip to [click here].
The left-hand menu covers most of what you'll want to do with Gmail. But in the central workspace, you can
easily read or search messages, and manage your email. Keep reading to learn how.

Frequently Asked Question: Gmail and Targeted Advertising
I've heard that Google scans all Gmail messages so they can display ads relating to the email's
content. Is Google invading my privacy?
When Google announced Gmail back in 2004, there was quite a bit of controversy about Google's
plan to insert context-sensitive ads in Gmail messages. Context-sensitive is industry-speak for a
process whereby Gmail scans your emails, looks for keywords, and then pairs the email with
advertising that relates to those keywords. For example, if a friend writes to you about her
mountain-biking vacation in the Rockies, when you open her email, you see ads for things like
mountain lodges, Rocky Mountain vacation spots, bicycle retailers, and so on. Usually, one ad's
displayed above the message you're reading, and several others are on the right-hand side of the
page. The ads are so unobtrusive that you can easily ignore them. But does context-sensitive
advertising invade your privacy?
You might feel a little more comfortable knowing that none of that scanning is done by human
eyes, so nobody actually reads your emails. And scanning incoming email isn't an unusual
practice; all email services regularly scan incoming messages to watch for viruses, spam, and so
on.
Gmail also tries to keep things tasteful. Emails that mention sex, for example, don't display ads for
porn sites. And if you receive an email about a tragedy, such as a death in the family, Gmail,
thank goodness, doesn't display any ads at all.
One other thing to know: Unlike other free, Web-based email providers, Gmail doesn't stick ads on
your outgoing emails (for now, anyway). Both Hotmail and Yahoo Mail, for example, tack an ad
onto the end of each and every email you send from their accounts. (These ads have nothing to do
with the email's content, though.)
If the idea of a computer scanning your incoming emails and matching them up with ads bothers
you, don't use Gmail. On the other hand, Gmail's ads are easy to ignore. And who knows—you
might find an occasional targeted ad useful. In that case, all you have to do is click its link, and
your Web browser opens the ad in a new window.

Chapter 7
Chapter 5. Gmail: Email Google-Style
When Google introduced Gmail in 2004, it set the Internet buzzing about its revolutionary approach to Web-
based email. What's so different about Gmail?
Massive amounts of storage—for free. Back in 2004, most Web-based email programs offered maybe
a couple of megabytes of storage. (If you wanted more, you could buy it.) Gmail roared onto the scene
with a full gigabyte of storage—that's 1,000 megabytes (enough space to store 500,000 pages of
email)—and it didn't cost a cent. And Google keeps adding more space. As of early 2008, Gmail was
offering over six gigabytes of free storage.
A new way of organizing your messages. Most email programs use folders to organize your email.
This works pretty well—until you're trying to find a particular message and you can't remember which
folder you stuck it in. Instead of folders, Google has introduced two innovations for organizing your email:
labels and conversations. Labels are colored identifiers you can add to email messages to make them easy
to find. You can sort by labels, create a filter to label messages automatically, and even stick more than
one label on a message. Gmail also keeps back-and-forth email replies together in conversations, making
it easy to find a particular email within the context of a larger dialog.
Excellent searching ability. Google applied its searching expertise to email, making it a snap to zero in
on any email you've ever sent or received—fast. You can even fine-tune your search criteria to make
searching more efficient.
Google's added more features to Gmail since then, and opened it up so everyone can get an account (originally,
it was by invitation only). This chapter explains all Gmail's features and offers tips and tricks to make you a
Gmail power user in no time flat.
5.1. Welcome to Gmail: A Quick Tour
Before you can start sending and receiving emails with Gmail, you have to sign up for an account, of course.
The simplest method is to start with a (free) Google Account (see Chapter 1 for details on how to activate this
essential passport to most of Google's offerings).

NOTE
In Google's eyes, there's a difference between your all-encompassing Google Account and the Gmail
account you set up to actually use their email service. In a nutshell, the first gets you access to all of
Google's apps and services, while the second mainly consists of the email address and password you
need to get your email.
Once you've logged into your Google Accounts page (www.google.com/accounts), head to the "Try something
new" section, and click the Gmail link. Or you can go straight to Gmail (www.gmail.com or mail.google.com)
and try signing in using your Google Account user name and password. If you haven't already done so, choose a
Gmail address (like your.name@gmail.com—see the following Note for tips about picking a Gmail address), and
select and answer a security question (in case you forget your password). Optionally, you can add a secondary
email address to your Gmail account—helpful if you forget your password (this text box is prefilled if your
Google Account already lists a secondary email address—see [click here]). When you're done filling out this
abbreviated sign-up form, click Continue to get Gmail up and running.
NOTE
Although you can use periods in your Gmail address, Gmail doesn't actually recognize periods—it treats
the login name exactly the same with or without the periods. So if your Gmail address is
jessesmith@gmail.com, email sent to jesse.smith@gmail.com or even j.e.s.s.e.s.m.i.t.h@gmail.com will
still reach you. (You might put periods in to make the name easier to read or to avoid awkward
abbreviations; for example, Lori Over might prefer l.over@gmail.com to lover@gmail.com.) Make your
login name simple and easy to remember, like FirstNameLastName or InitialsLastName.
Frequently Asked Question: Gmail and Security
Is using Web-based email secure?
It seems like there's always a news story about security problems and the Internet: viruses,
worms, identity theft, hackers stealing sensitive data—the list goes on. It's enough to make you
wonder: Is it safe to use a Web-based email account like Gmail? The last thing you need is
someone hacking into your account and reading your email.
A Web page is secure when it encrypts the information it sends. That means that, instead of
transmitting words a person could read, the page scrambles the content into a kind of code before
sending it, foiling any would-be spies. (The scrambled info gets unscrambled once it reaches its
destination—a friend's email inbox, say.)
You can tell whether a Web page is secure by the letters at the beginning of the page's address in
your browser's address bar: https means a secure connection that encrypts your data and protects
your privacy. ("Https" is short for "hypertext transfer protocol over secure sockets layer"—don't
ask). That s on the end is important, because it distinguishes the address from plain old http,
which means the page isn't secure. ("Http" stands for "hypertext transfer protocol.")

Here's some good news: Gmail offers the most secure free, Web-based email out there. Whenever
you log in to Gmail, you log in through a secure connection. (Type gmail.com into your browser,
and Google takes you to a page with a long URL that starts with https.) That means Gmail
scrambles your password so nobody can pluck it out of the air and steal it.
After you log in, Gmail takes you to a plain ol' http version of the site. But if you're really security-
minded (or if you're in a coffee shop using a public wireless network and you're not too sure about
that geeky-looking kid in the corner, typing away at his laptop and cackling), Gmail offers a secure
connection so that everything to do with your Gmail account gets encrypted. To beef up your
Gmail security, use this URL to log into Gmail: https://mail.google.com (don't forget the s in
"https"). If you're already in the middle of a Gmail session, just type that address into your
browser's address bar to get a secure connection.
One drawback to using a secure connection is that it might slow Gmail down a bit. Browsers don't
store https pages in their caches (where a Web browser keeps info about the Web sites you visit
so it can load them more quickly). So whenever you move from one page to another within Gmail,
your browser has to reload all the code that makes Gmail work. Sometimes, though, the slight
delay is worth it to make sure your data's secure.
You can also access Gmail from a cellphone or other mobile device. Start up your
phone's browser, and then point it to http://gmail.com to sign in.

it—with a lot less mess than digging through the garbage can.

your Web browser opens the ad in a new window.
 

 
5.2. Reading and Filtering Email
Get comfy with your Gmail inbox—you'll be spending a lot of time there. It's where new emails land as they
come flying in to your account. And it's where you can get an overview of how your Gmail conversations are
progressing.
Conversations—has kind of a nice ring, doesn't it? That's what Gmail calls email exchanges. Instead of just piling
each new email on top of the others as they come into your inbox, Gmail keeps track of related emails,
organizing them into conversations. Here's how it works: Say a friend shoots you an email inviting you to the
movies on Saturday. You reply, asking her which movie she wants to see. She emails a couple of suggestions,
and you go back and forth debating the merits of the latest chick flick vs. the latest zombie horror-fest. Gmail
keeps these related emails in a group, making it easy for you to follow the progress of the conversation. Figure
5-2 shows what a conversation looks like in your inbox.
Figure 5-2. Your inbox lists the most recent emails you've received, with the newest one at the top.
When you've got a conversation going on, Gmail lists the names of the participants and shows, in
parentheses, the number of messages in the exchange. A single email (that is, one that's not part of
a back-and-forth conversation) shows only the name of the person who sent it.
NOTE
A conversation continues as long you and the other person keep hitting Reply and leaving the subject
line as it is. When the subject line changes, Gmail interprets this as the start of a new conversation.

With most Web-based email, you have to keep refreshing your inbox to see if any new messages have arrived.
Gmail spares you that effort by checking for new mail every couple of minutes. When a new message lands in
your inbox, Gmail lets you know in two ways:
It puts the new email at the top of the stack in your inbox.
It changes the number that appears next to Inbox in the left-hand menu.
Unread emails (whether they're new or old) appear in boldface. After you've read an email, it loses its boldface
formatting in the inbox.
If you use iGoogle, Google's customizable home page service (Chapter 8), you can
display your Gmail inbox right on your home page—[click here] tells you how.
5.2.1. Reading Email
The very first time you log into Gmail, there's a message from the Gmail Team waiting for you. Reading this
message, or any email for that matter, couldn't be simpler, as Figure 5-3 shows:
Make sure your inbox is front and center.
If something else is highlighted in the left-hand menu, then click the Inbox link.
Figure 5-3. To view all your new email, in the left-hand menu, click the Inbox link. Then
click any email's title to view its contents.
1.

In the central part of the Gmail workspace, click the email you want to read. (You can click anywhere but
the email's checkbox or star to get it to open.) Unread messages appear in boldface font.
Gmail opens the message for you to read, as shown in Figure 5-4. Choices about what to do with the
message appear above its text.
Figure 5-4. The window for reading your email may look a little crowded at first, but
that's because there's a lot you can do from here. The message's text appears in the
center of the screen. Above it are buttons (circled) your can use to do various things
like delete, report as spam, and so on. To reply to a message, click the upper-right
Reply link (also circled), or just start typing your response in the text box at the bottom
of the page.
2.

Decide what, if anything, you want to do with the email.
To answer it, click the Reply link or start typing in the text box below the message. Buttons across the top
of the workspace let you archive it ([click here]), report it to Gmail as spam ([click here]), or delete it
([click here]). The More Actions drop-down menu includes some less popular choices: Mark as unread
([click here]), Add star ([click here]), Create event ([click here]), Filter messages like these ([click here]),
Mute ([click here]), and Apply label ([click here]).
NOTE
When you get an email inviting you to a party or a meeting, it's a good idea to pencil in that event
on your calendar right away, before you forget. If you use Google Calendar (Chapter 7), you can
add events to your calendar right from Gmail. When you're reading an email with info about an
event, click More Actions, and then select "Create event". A new window opens (shown in Figure
7-4), where you can fill in the what, when, and where of the event. When you've filled in the
event's info, click "Save changes", and Google adds the event to your calendar.
3.
To get back to your inbox, click either Inbox in the left-hand menu or the "Back to Inbox" link above the
message.
Gmail whisks you back to your inbox.
4.

To open the message you're currently viewing in a new window, look above the
Sponsored Ads on the right, and click the "New window" link. This gives you a cleaner
view of your message, without as many buttons and menus as your inbox. However, you
also can't do as much from this new window as you can from your inbox.
5.2.1.1. Reading emails in a conversation
When you and a pal send several emails back and forth, Gmail shows a single placeholder for the
conversation—not the individual emails—in the inbox. So how do you find a particular email within that
conversation?
Simple. In your inbox, click the placeholder (it begins with the original subject line). Instead of showing a single
message for you to read, Gmail shows a stack of 'em, as in Figure 5-5. Click the message you want to read, and
Gmail expands it so you can see its content. To hide the message again, click the sender's name.
Figure 5-5. This conversation contains four messages. Gmail stacks them, with the most recent
message on top, and gives you a peek at the first line of each message. To view an older message,
click it. To see them all, click "Expand all" (circled).
If you want to see all the messages in a conversation, click "Expand all" above the Sponsored Links on the right,
and Gmail does just that. To put the messages back in a stack, click the same button, which now reads

"Collapse all".
5.2.2. Opening Attachments
When an email with an attachment lands in your inbox, Gmail lets you know with a little paper clip (see Figure
5-6). When you open an email with an attachment, Gmail tells you what kind of file it is, and includes links that
give you a couple different ways to handle the attachment, as shown in Figure 5-7.
Figure 5-6. In your inbox, the paper clip icon (circled) lets you know that email has one or more
attachments. Click the email to see what kind of file is attached.
NOTE
File attachments can be a threat to your computer—for example, viruses are often sent as attachments.
For that reason, Gmail neither sends nor receives executable files—typically with a file extension
.exe—which can launch programs and wreak havoc on your computer.
5.2.2.1. Images
When an email has images attached, as in Figure 5-7, Gmail shows you a preview of the image, and two links to
choose from:
View. Click this link to display the image in a new browser window.
Download. This link saves the attached image to your computer.

Figure 5-7. When an email has an image attached, Gmail shows you a thumbnail of the image, as
well as the file's name and size. If you want to see the full-size image or save it to your computer,
click the View or Download link (circled, bottom), respectively. If more than one image is attached,
you can view them all (in a single browser window) or save them all at once by clicking either
"Download all attachments" or "View all images" (circled, top).
Be careful about downloading attachments—way too many viruses are swarming around
the Internet to risk opening a suspicious file. Gmail automatically scans attachments for
viruses when email arrives in your inbox, and again when you open the attachment. But
to be on the safe side, never open or download an attachment unless you know the
sender and were expecting the file.
5.2.2.2. Documents
As Figure 5-8 shows, Gmail can handle attached documents in three ways:
View as HTML. This is a quick 'n' easy way to preview a document. When you click it, your Web browser
opens the document in a new window, but without any images or complex formatting.
Figure 5-8. Gmail gives you several options (circled) for dealing with attached documents.

NOTE
Gmail offers the "View as HTML" option for files with these extensions: .pdf, .doc, .xls, .ppt, .rtf,
.sxw, .sxc, .sxi, .sdw, .sdc, .sdd, and .wml. These are all common formats for things like text and
spreadsheet files.
Open as a Google document. If you use Google Docs (Chapter 2–Chapter 4), this link opens the file
there. If you haven't signed up for Google Docs yet, clicking this link takes you to a super-simple form (it
just asks for your first and last names), and then imports the file into your brand-spankin'-new Google
Docs account.
Download. Click this link to save the file to your computer.
5.2.2.3. Audio and video files
When someone attaches an audio or video file, Gmail gives you the options of playing or downloading the
attached file. Click the appropriate link to play the file in a new window or download it.
5.2.2.4. Zip files
When someone wants to send you a collection of files or a ginormous attachment, they might create a zip file
using a program like WinZip or ZipIt. Zipping a file compresses it, squeezing the files into a smaller package
that takes up less memory than the files themselves. Zip files typically end with the file extension .zip.

You can receive attached zip files in Gmail, as long as they pass Gmail's attachment test:
Zip files may not contain executable files—files that can be run as a program.
Zip files may not be password-protected or encrypted. (You wouldn't want a virus to sneak in that way.)
They can't make the email bigger than Gmail's limit of 20MB.
When you receive a zip file as an attachment, Gmail gives you the option to download it. To see the files
contents, you have to unzip it, which generally entails double-clicking it. (Mac computers have this unzipping
feature built-in; Windows fans may need to download a program like WinZip or ZipIt to uncork the zipped files.)
5.2.3. Filtering Incoming Mail
If your inbox is overflowing with messages, filtering can help you close the floodgates (or at least redirect the
traffic in more manageable ways). A filter is a set of instructions that tells Gmail how to handle incoming mail.
For example, if you want to make sure that emails from an important client get flagged so you don't miss them,
then you can set up a filter to automatically star ([click here]) those messages when they arrive. On the other
hand, if you belong to a recipe-exchange email list, the latest chocolate-raspberry soufflé recipe can probably
wait. Gmail can label (Google's version of a folder storage system; see [click here]) and archive ([click here])
any message with recipe in the subject line so that it doesn't take up space in your inbox, but you can still find
it when you're ready to fire up the oven.
Gmail filters are flexible: You can tell Gmail to label, star, archive, forward, or delete incoming emails based on
certain words in the subject or body of the message, the sender, the recipient (if you use Gmail to manage
other email accounts—see [click here]), whether it has any attachments, or any combination of these traits.
To set up a filter, click your way to the Settings page's Filters tab (Settings
Filters). From there, click the
"Create a new filter" link to open the page shown in Figure 5-9.
Figure 5-9. Gmail makes it easy to set up filters to organize incoming email.

Here's a shortcut for creating filters: At the top of just about any Gmail page, right next
to the "Search the Web" button, click the tiny "Create a filter" link. Presto! Gmail adds a
section to the page that looks like the upper part of Figure 5-9, letting you create a filter
from whatever page you're on.
Once you're on the "Create a Filter" page, here's how to fill it out:
Tell Gmail what to look for by setting your filtering criteria. You've got six criteria you can use to tell Gmail
what to watch for:
From. If you want to filter based on the sender's email address, type that address here.
To. You can receive email from up to five other accounts in Gmail (for example, you can forward
your work email and that complimentary alumni account you rarely use to Gmail; see [click here] for
details). To filter based on which account the email was sent to, type the relevant email address
here.
Subject. When you type a word or phrase into this box, Gmail scans the Subject lines of incoming
messages for those items. (If you want to the filter to look for on an exact phrase—not just the
individual words that make up the phrase—throw a pair of quotation marks around the phrase.)
Don't worry about capital letters—Gmail ignores 'em.
Has the words. Whatever you enter here, Google looks for in both the body and the subject line of
incoming emails. Use quotation marks to identify an exact phrase, and don't bother distinguishing
1.

between upper- and lowercase letters.
Doesn't have. This box tells Gmail to apply the filter to messages that lack a particular word or
phrase. For example, a college student could filter out emails coming from Dad that don't contain
the word cash.
Has attachment. Turn on this checkbox to apply the filter only to messages with one or more
attachments.
You can enter just one criterion or a combination of several.
Check and submit your filtering criteria.
To check the emails you've already received to see which would be filtered according to the info you've
entered, click Test Search. (This is a good way to make sure your filter finds the emails you want it to. If it
doesn't, tweak your criteria and test it again.) When everything looks good, click Next Step, and Gmail
takes you to the page shown in Figure 5-10.
Figure 5-10. Here's where you tell Gmail what to do with emails that match your
filtering criteria. You can have Gmail perform more than one action on an email—just
turn on the appropriate checkboxes.

Skip the Inbox (Archive it). When you turn on this checkbox, Gmail puts filtered email into your
All Mail mailbox instead of your inbox. You won't get any notification that the email has arrived, but
you can search for it whenever you like ([click here]).
Mark as read. Turning on this checkbox means that filtered email still lands in your inbox, but it
doesn't have the markers of a fresh, new email: It isn't in boldface, and it doesn't change the new
message count that's in parentheses next to Inbox in the left-hand menu.
Star it. Gmail adds a star to mark the message as high priority.
Apply the label. Labels ([click here]) help you organize Gmail messages into different categories. If
you want to label filtered mail, turn on this checkbox, and then, from the drop-down list, choose the
label you want. (The drop-down list also lets you create a new label—see [click here]).
Forward it to. Turning on this checkbox sends a copy of filtered messages to the email address you
type here. (Unless you tell it otherwise, Gmail also sticks a copy in your inbox.) For example, if you
want to forward all correspondence from your soon-to-be-ex-spouse to your lawyer, then enter the
lawyer's email address here.
Delete it. This option sends messages meeting the filtering criteria straight into the trash. And
because Gmail regularly empties your Trash mailbox for you, those messages are gone for good
after 30 days.
Click Create Filter.
Google creates your filter, and immediately applies it to all incoming email.
If you're reading an email and want to set up a filter for this message and similar
ones—all emails about the launch of a new project, say—click More Actions
"Filter messages like these". (You can also select messages in a mailbox, and then
choose this option.) Gmail shows the filter options with the sender's From address
already filled in. From there, you can filter by sender and/or any of the other
filtering criteria.

Power Users' Clinic: Going Undercover with Aliases
With all the spam out there, you don't always want to give out your real email address. The more
people and Web sites know your email address, the more likely it is to fall into the hands of a
spammer. Fortunately, aliases can help you avoid this problem.
An email alias is an address that gets forwarded to another address. For example, a lot of
companies have addresses on their site like info@ourcompany.com. There probably isn't a single
person in the company whose email address is info@ourcompany.com. Instead, email sent to that
address probably gets forwarded to bob@ourcompany.com, who's in the customer service
department, and terry@ourcompany.com, who's in PR.
Similarly, Gmail lets you create an email alias by putting a plus sign (+) and any character or
keyword you like after your user name. These aliases get forwarded to your regular Gmail address,
and you can handily keep track of who's sending you information, or filter out unwanted emails.
For example, if you tell someone your address is yourname+abc@gmail.com, then when he sends
an email to that address, it lands in your Gmail inbox.
You can use this little trick to filter incoming email. Say you're filling out a company's Contact Us
form because you want to give them some feedback. You're required to enter an email address to
submit the form, but you don't want to end up on some mailing list. So instead of your regular
Gmail address, type something like myname+feedback@gmail.com (using your actual Gmail ID in
place of myname). If the company responds to your feedback, great. If you start getting lots of
junk directed to that address, you can filter it straight into your Spam or Trash mailbox.
Use the same trick when you're in newsgroups and chat rooms to foil the spambots—automated
programs that crawl around the Web gathering email addresses for spammers.
5.2.3.1. Applying a filter to existing emails
Email filtering tends to be a forward-looking thing: You create a filter, and then it deals with new emails as they
arrive in your account. But what if you create a filter and think, "Man, it'd be great if I could use this filter to
sort emails I've already got!" Luckily, Gmail gives you this option. Say your boss tells you she wants to see all
correspondence on the Fletcher account—now. You can create a filter to find relevant emails you've received
and forward them to her automatically. And she'd get a copy of any future emails regarding the Fletcher
account. Pretty spiffy, huh?
To set up a retroactive filter, follow the steps in the previous section. When you get to step 3, you have a
chance to apply the filter to email messages you've already received. On the second screen of the Create a
Filter page (Figure 5-10), take a look at the bottom of the page, beneath the "Create a Filter" box. Gmail has
screened your existing emails to see whether any meet your filter criteria, and displays the results here. In
Figure 5-10, two conversations meet the criteria.
To apply the filter to those existing emails, just turn on the "Also apply filter to xx conversations below"
checkbox (it's right next to the Create Filter button). Now, when you click Create Filter, Gmail applies that filter
to the existing messages from the list—and to any new messages that come flying into your Gmail account and
meet your filtering criteria.
5.2.3.2. Editing a filter

If you need to make changes to a filter, the process is nearly identical to creating the filter in the first place
([click here]). Start by heading to the Settings page's Filters tab (Settings
Filters). Then:
In the list of existing filters, find the one you want to change, and then click its right-hand "edit" link.
When the "Create a Filter" page opens, it looks just like the one in Figure 5-9, except it has the filter's
criteria already filled in.
1.
Make any changes you want to the filtering criteria, and then click Next Step.
The second screen of the "Create a Filter" page (Figure 5-10) has the actions you've chosen already filled
in.
2.
If you want to tweak these actions, tweak away. If you want to apply the edited filter to existing emails,
select the conversations you want from the "Search results" list at the bottom of the screen, and then turn
on the "Also apply filter to xx conversations below" checkbox. Then, click Update Filter.
Gmail changes the filter to reflect the changes you've made.
3.
5.2.3.3. Deleting a filter
When a filter has outlived its usefulness, you can delete it. Choose Settings
Filters to get to the Filters tab of
the Settings page. There, find the filter you don't want. To its right is a "delete" link. Click the link, and
poof!—the filter is history.
Deleting a filter doesn't undo the actions the filter took while it was active. For example, if you delete a filter
that slapped a gold star on certain incoming messages, those messages still have that star after the filter is
gone. But Gmail no longer applies the star to new messages.
When you click "delete" to get rid of a filter, Gmail doesn't ask you to confirm your
decision to delete. It just wipes out the filter. So make sure the filter you're deleting
really is the one you want to get rid of. Otherwise, you'll have to rebuild it from scratch.
5.2.4. Fetching Email from a Different Account
A lot of people have several email accounts: one for work, one for personal use, one for saving the world under
their superhero guises. As these accounts proliferate, it can be hard to keep up with them all. Gmail's Mail
Fetcher can help you manage your email accounts from one place, by grabbing messages from up to five
addresses and pulling them into Gmail. That means you can log into Gmail as mild-mannered
johndoe@gmail.com and read messages sent to maskedwonder@sooprhero.com.
Before you tell Gmail to start fetching your mail, though, make sure that your other email account can
cooperate. Mail Fetcher works with accounts that support POP (read all about it on [click here] and the box on
[click here]). Popular email programs such as Outlook, Eudora, Entourage, Thunderbird, and Netscape Mail
support POP access. For free, Web-based email accounts, it's a bit more hit-or-miss. Hotmail and Yahoo, for
example, offer POP accounts only to customers who pony up for an upgraded account. If you're not sure

whether your email account supports POP, contact its customer service or search the Help files for POP.
Once you know that your email account supports POP, you also have to make sure it's turned on. How you do
that varies with different email services, so search Help or contact tech support.
When you've got POP support turned on in your other email account, you're ready to turn on Gmail's Mail
Fetcher. You do that on the Settings page's Accounts tab (Settings
Accounts), and then follow these steps:
In the "Get mail from other accounts" section, click the "Add another mail account" link.
The box shown in Figure 5-11 appears.
1.
Figure 5-11. Tell Gmail where to fetch your email from by typing the other email account's address.
Type in the email address you want Gmail to collect mail from, and then click Next Step.
Gmail opens the box shown in Figure 5-12. Some of the boxes are already filled in: the email address from
step 1, user name, POP Server, and Port. You've got several other options to consider:
Figure 5-12. Here's where you tell Gmail your other email account's password and how
you want it to handle the messages it fetches.
0.

Leave a copy of retrieved message on the server. Turning on the checkbox means that when
Gmail grabs your email from another account, it says to that account, "Okay, I've got the email. But
you hang onto a copy of it, too, okay?" If you turn on this checkbox, the next time you log in to, say,
Outlook, the email messages transferred to Gmail also appear in your Outlook account. If, on the
other hand, you want to read your email messages only in Gmail, leave this checkbox turned off, and
your other email account deletes the messages Gmail fetches.
NOTE
Your other email provider may not let you leave messages in that email account after Gmail
fetches them. If that's the case, Gmail shows you this error message when you try to add
the other account: "[server] does not support leaving messages on the server". Turn off this
checkbox, and then try again.
Always use a secure connection (SSL) when retrieving email. SSL stands for "secure sockets
layer," which uses encryption ([click here]) to make sure that info traveling over the Internet is safe
from prying eyes. If you've bought stuff online, the shopping cart pages have probably used SSL to
send your credit card number securely. Turning on this checkbox means the stuff that Gmail fetches
from your other account travels through a similarly secure connection.
It's definitely a good idea to turn this checkbox on—unless your email provider doesn't support SSL.
If that's the case, Gmail tells you it had a problem connecting, and a "Show error details" link
appears. Click the link. If the error is "internal error: Protocol error", turn off this checkbox or
fetching won't work.

Label incoming messages. Gmail creates a label ([click here]) based on the email address you
typed in step 2. Turn on this checkbox, and Gmail automatically applies that label to all email
fetched from that account. Or, you can have it apply a different label—just choose one from the
drop-down list.
Archive incoming messages. Turn on this checkbox to archive ([click here]) fetched email, rather
than sending it to your Gmail inbox. This step helps keep your inbox clutter-free.
Choose the settings you want, and then click Add Account.
Gmail brings your other account into the fold. From now on, it checks the other account for email every
few minutes. You're not quite done, though. Another box opens, asking whether you want to use Gmail to
send mail using the other account's email address in the From line. Using this feature, John Doe can
respond to pleas for help sent to maskedwonder@sooprhero.com without leaving Gmail—or exposing his
true identity.
1.
If you want to send messages from Gmail using the email address you entered in step 1, turn on the "Yes,
I want to be able to send mail as" radio button, and then click Next Step. Otherwise, select No, and then
click Finish.
If you select No, you're done. If you select Yes, then flip to [click here] to see what happens next.

5.3. Writing and Sending Email
Getting email is only half the fun. After all, a conversation isn't a conversation if you don't get to have your say,
too. This section tells you everything you need to know to write and send email using Gmail.
5.3.1. Writing a New Message
Want to send a love note, a business memo, or your latest news? From any page in Gmail, click the upper-left
Compose Mail link. The page shown in Figure 5-13 opens, where you can write your cyber-note (or cyber-tome).
Figure 5-13. Composing an email in Gmail is simple. You can write a plain-vanilla email, or use the
formatting buttons (circled) to pick a different font, create a list, add highlighting or a hyperlink, and
more. Then make sure your spelling is squeaky clean with the Check Spelling link on the right. When
you're done, click either of the two Send buttons (they're above and below your message).
Even if you've never sent an email, Gmail makes it easy. Here's what you've got to work with:
To. This is where you type the email address of the person to whom you're writing. If the recipient is on
your Contacts list ([click here]), Gmail guesses the person's name as you type. Click a suggestion to make
it jump into the To box. You can send the same email to more than one person; just separate their email

addresses with commas.
Add Cc/Add Bcc. Back in the olden days, you could only make a copy of a document by putting a sheet
of carbon paper between two sheets of paper, and then cramming the whole packet into a typewriter.
Nowadays, it's a lot easier (and neater) to send off a copy of your email. There's no carbon involved
anymore, but the abbreviations from the days of yore have stuck—Cc for "carbon copy" and Bcc for "blind
carbon copy." Click "Add Cc" or "Add Bcc" to open a new text box where you can type in an address. When
you send your email, Gmail sends a copy to that address and the address in the To box. The only
difference is that, with a carbon copy, the recipient (the person who's address is in the To field) can see
the Cc address; with a blind carbon copy, the recipient can't see the Bcc address.
Subject. Announce what your email is about using this box.
Attach a file. To add an attachment to your email, click this link, and then follow the directions on [click
here].
Formatting buttons. Formatting can make your email look sharp. To apply formatting, select the text
you want to format, and then click one of these buttons. From left to right in Figure 5-13, here's what they
are:
Bold.
Italic.
Underline.
NOTE
If you don't see the formatting buttons on your screen, you instead see a link that reads
"Rich formatting". Click this link to make the formatting buttons appear. The link changes to
read "Plain formatting"—click it to hide the buttons again. Gmail automatically uses
whichever kind of formatting you choose here until you tell it to use the other kind. See the
Note on [click here] for more on plain vs. rich formatting.
Font. Here's where you choose from the fonts Gmail offers (there are currently seven). Click this
button to see a drop-down list that shows what each font looks like.
Size. Your choices for font size are small, normal, large, and huge (for when you're feeling
emphatic).
Color. You've got your choice of 70 different font colors.

Highlight Color. Pick a color, and then apply it to any text you want to emphasize.
Link. Use this button to make some of the text in your message a link to a Web page; see [click
here] to learn how.
Numbered List.
Bulleted List.
If you forget what any of the formatting buttons are for and you don't have
this book handy, just hover your cursor over a button. After a second or two,
you see a tiny label that tells you which button it is.
Indent Less. Moves your text closer to the left side of the message box.
Indent More. Pushes your text further to the right.
Quote. To show that part of your email is a quotation, select the relevant text and click this button.
Gmail indents the text, and puts a gray line to its left.
Align Left. Your email lines up neatly, flush against the left margin.
Align Center. Center your text.
Align Right. Your email lines up neatly, flush against the right margin.
Remove Formatting. Okay, so maybe huge, bold, purple, italic letters are a bit much. To undo all
the formatting you've applied, select the formatted text, and then click this button.
Plain Text. Don't want to mess around with all those formatting buttons? Click this link and they're gone.
(The link changes to read "Rich formatting". Click it to bring the buttons back.)
NOTE
If you've formatted a message—say you broke out some bullet points—and you switch to plain text
before you send it, you lose any formatting you've applied. (The text stays, just not the
formatting.) If you click Plain Text while writing a message that has formatting, Gmail pops up a
warning box asking if you really want to lose the formatting you've added.

Check Spelling. Click this link to check for misspellings and typos. Gmail highlights any words it doesn't
recognize in yellow; click on a yellow word to bring up a list of suggested spellings.
If you write emails in more than one language, Gmail guesses the language of the
email you're working on and uses the appropriate dictionary. If Gmail's guess is
wrong, next to the Check Spelling link, click the arrow, and, from the list that
appears, select the language you want.
Message box. This isn't labeled, but it's the big text box that takes up most of the Compose Mail
workspace. Type the body of your message here.
NOTE
The next three buttons appear at both the top and bottom of your screen. They work the same
way—just click your pick.
Send. Click this button to send your email to its lucky recipient(s).
Save Now. If you're working on an email and don't have time to finish it, click this button to save what
you've written so far. (See [click here] for more about saving drafts.)
Discard. If you start writing a resignation email to your boss but then have a change of heart, click this
button to toss your message. Gmail doesn't ask you to confirm your decision before it discards your email,
and it doesn't send it to the Trash so you can retrieve it, so be sure you want to get rid of an email before
clicking this button.
5.3.2. Replying
When someone sends you an email, you often want to fire off a response. In Gmail, you can click the Reply link
(it's circled back in Figure 5-4), or click inside the text box that appears below the email you just read. Either
way, you end up in the Compose Mail workspace shown in Figure 5-13.
If the email was sent to you and at least one other person, then you see another link at the bottom of the
message: "Reply to all". Click this link to send your response to everyone who received the original email. This
link's handy when you're trying to plan a gathering with a bunch of friends.
5.3.3. Forwarding
Some news is so good, some jokes are so funny, and some photos are so darned cute you've just got to share
'em. When you get an email you want to pass on to someone else, look below the body of the email for the

Forward link. Click it, and the Compose Mail workspace (Figure 5-13) opens with the content of the email you're
forwarding already in the message box. Just add your recipient(s) to the To box, type anything you want to add
in the message box, and click Send. Off goes that adorable puppy photo to Aunt Edna.
NOTE
When you forward an email, Gmail includes any attachments that were part of the original message. But
if you reply to a message that has an attachment, then that file doesn't get sent back to the person who
sent it to you—that would be silly.
5.3.4. Attaching a File
Having a Google Account may actually reduce the number of files you send via email. For example, you can use
Picasa ([click here]) to show the world your Web-based photo albums and Google Docs to share documents
(Chapter 2), spreadsheets (Chapter 3), and slideshow presentations (Chapter 4).
But when you need to attach a file to an outgoing email, it's simple. On the Compose Mail page (Figure 5-13),
there's an "Attach a file" link just under the Subject text box. Click that link, and the page expands to include a
new text box where you can enter your file's location (if you know where it lives on your computer). Or you can
click the Browse button to find the file you want to attach. Gmail opens the File Upload window; locate the file
you want, select it, and then click Open to attach it to your email.
To add another attachment, click "Attach another file", and then repeat the process. If you change your mind
and want to remove a file you've attached, click the "remove" link to the right of the Browse button or turn off
the checkbox to the right of that file. (What you do depends on how many files you've attached.)
5.3.5. Adding Hyperlinks
Sometimes its simpler to point friends to a Web page rather than saying: "Hey, check out this story on the
lizard beauticians at CNN.com. First, click the Entertainment section; then scroll down to..."—you get the idea.
The easiest way to put a link to a Web page in an email is to use the Compose Mail page's Link button (Figure
5-14), which looks like some links of chain—well, sort of.
Figure 5-14. The Link button (circled) lets you link the text you've selected to a Web page.

Adding a link to some text in your email takes just a couple of steps:
In the body of the email, select the text you want to contain the link, and then click the Link button.
Gmail pops up an Edit Link box, as shown in Figure 5-15.
1.
Decide what you want to link to.
You can link to a Web page or an email (so clicking the link opens a new email message addressed to that
person). If you're linking to a Web page, type (or paste) the Web address of the page into the text box. If
you're linking to an email address, turn on the "Email address" radio button, and then type in the email
address. When it all looks good, click OK.
Gmail adds the link, underlining the text you selected to show it's a hyperlink. As you can see in Figure 5-
16, Gmail also displays a box that shows you the address of the link you just added. If you keep typing
your message, the box disappears. You can get it back, though, by clicking the link.
2.
Figure 5-15. You can link to either a Web page or an email address. If you're linking to a Web page,
click "Test this link" (circled) to make sure the link works.

Figure 5-16. After you've added a link to your email, you can see what it links to by clicking it. When
you do, Gmail displays the box shown here. If you notice a mistake in the link, click Change. To
delete the link, click Remove. To close the box, either click its upper-right X or just go back to typing
your email.

To make sure you get the URL of your link exactly right, open another browser window
or tab, surf to the page you want, select what's in the browser's address bar, and then
hit Ctrl+C (
-C on a Mac) to copy the address. Go back to the Gmail message you're
writing, click inside the "Link to" text box, and then paste in the address using Ctrl+V (
-V).
5.3.6. Using a Different "From" Address
As explained on [click here], you can fetch messages from other email accounts and pull them into Gmail. But if
you do that, you probably don't want to confuse people by sending responses from your Gmail address. For
example, say your boss sends an email to your work email account, which gets pulled into Gmail. If you reply to
her in the normal way ([click here]), your response looks like it comes from your Gmail address, which your
boss may not even recognize. And besides, you might not want her to know your Gmail address.
No problem. You can use Gmail to send a message from any email address that you can verify, meaning you
can prove it's yours. (In other words, Gmail doesn't let you send email from somebody else's address.) Instead
of yourname@gmail.com, the email's return address will be yourname@myISP.com or
yourname@mycompany.com—whatever address the person sent their original email to. That way, you don't
confuse your recipient, and when she responds, her reply email goes to the From address you've supplied.
First, add and verify your alternate email address. Click Settings
Accounts; from there, follow these steps:
Click the "Add another email address" link.
Gmail opens the box shown in Figure 5-17, with your name already filled in.
Figure 5-17. To add another email address to your Gmail account, type it here. To use it
in the From line of emails you send from Gmail, click the "Specify a different 'reply-to'
address" link (circled).
1.

In the "Email address" text box, type in your alternate email address. Then click the "Specify a different
'reply-to' address" link.
The box expands to include a new text box, labeled "Reply-to address".
2.
In the From line, type the address you want. (It's probably the same address you typed in step 2.) Check
to make sure you typed both addresses correctly, and then click Next Step.
Gmail opens a new box, explaining that you can't use just any old email address—it has to be one you can
prove is yours. So forget about trying to fake your archenemy's or favorite celebrity's email address. (Click
Cancel, or click Back to enter a different email address.)
3.
Click Send Verification.
Gmail send a verification email to the address you provided, and opens the box shown in Figure 5-18.
Figure 5-18. Before Gmail slaps a different From address on emails you send from
Gmail, you need to prove that the other account is legit. Do that by clicking the link in
the email Gmail sends to verify the account you're adding, or by pasting the email's
verification code into this box.
4.

Check your other account's inbox. You should get Gmail's verification message, which contains both a link
and a verification code. You can verify that account's address with Gmail in one of two ways: Either click
the link, or copy the verification code, paste it into Gmail's verification box, and click Verify.
Gmail adds the alternate email address to your Gmail account.
5.
Once you've added an alternate address, it appears on the Settings page's Accounts tab, as shown in Figure 5-
19. If you want all the emails you send from your Gmail account to look like they come from this alternate
address, click the "make default" link. (Gmail sends all replies there, too.)
Figure 5-19. After you've added an alternate address, you can make it the default address (the From
address of everything you send from your Gmail account), edit it, or—if you no longer want it
associated with Gmail—delete it.

If you've set things up to let Gmail fetch email from your other email accounts ([click
here]), then, on the Settings page's Accounts tab, turn on the button that says, "Reply
from the same address the message was sent to" (Figure 5-19). Now you won't confuse
friends and associates who email you at one address and get your reply from another.
What if you don't want all your Gmail messages to use the alternate From address? Easy. Now that you've
added an alternative address, when you go to write a new email, the Compose Mail page changes the From text
box to a drop-down menu. Click the From field's down arrow and, from the list, choose the reply address you
want.
If you're replying to ([click here]) or forwarding ([click here]) an email, click the "change" link next to your
address in the From line. This turns the From line into a drop-down list; simply select the email address you
want to use.
NOTE
Sending with a different From address doesn't completely conceal the fact that you're sending email from
your Gmail account. When email gets sent from a different address than the one listed in the From line,
the recipient's email program often tags it as spam (and with good reason—a lot of it is spam).
To keep your email from ending up trapped in a spam filter, your Gmail address appears as part of the
email's sender field (it's part of the headers, which include To, From, and Date). Most email programs
don't show the sender field, so once it's landed in your friend's inbox, your email looks like it came from
the From address you chose. Be aware, though, that some versions of Microsoft Outlook may show the
recipient something along these lines: "From [yourname@gmail.com] on behalf of

[youraddress@mydomain.com]." Mail sent to a yahoo.com account gets this addendum: "Yahoo!
DomainKeys has confirmed that this message was sent by gmail.com."
5.3.7. Saving a Draft
Life is full of interruptions. You may be halfway through writing an email, for example, when you realize you're
late for a meeting. Before you grab your briefcase and sprint down the hallway, take a second to save what
you've written so far. Click the Save Now button, and Gmail saves the current version of your email in the Drafts
mailbox. To open a draft and work on it some more, click the left-hand menu's Drafts link, and then select the
email you want.
5.3.7.1. Gmail saves the day—automatically
What if you can't click the Save Now button? Say the power goes out or your Web browser crashes. It's an awful
thought that your labored-over email might be lost, sending you back to square one.
Not to worry. When you're writing an email, Gmail automatically saves a copy for you every couple of minutes.
So even if you don't click Save Now, Gmail saves your email-in-progress and puts a copy in your Drafts mailbox.
If you successfully finish your email and send it off, Gmail deletes the drafts it's saved and puts a copy in your
Sent Mail mailbox. But if a browser crash or similar catastrophe happens, check your Drafts mailbox when you
log back into Gmail—your draft will be there.
5.3.8. Personalizing Your Gmail
Email messages can look so generic and blah. Gmail gives you a couple of ways to show the world that your
email comes from you.
5.3.8.1. Add a signature
Got a witty motto or saying you live by? An achievement you want to brag about? Maybe you just want to make
sure that business emails contain all your contact information, not just your email address. As [click here]
explains, you can add a signature—text that Gmail tacks on to the bottom of every email you send. Just head to
the Settings page's General tab (Settings
General), and then find the Signature section. Turn on the radio
button next to the text box there, and then type your signature into the box. Click Save Changes when you're
done.
Now, when you write an email ([click here]), the signature you typed here automatically appears in the box
where you compose your message. You can edit it like any other text, but if you want that change to apply to all
the emails you send, then take a trip back to Settings
General, and edit your signature there.
5.3.8.2. Add a photo
If you add a photo to your Gmail account, your photo travels with your contact info, so other Gmail fans can see
it when they add you to their Contacts list ([click here]). Why's that a good thing? Imagine a potential client
emails you asking for information, and you reply with the info and a suggestion to set up an appointment. If
that person uses Gmail, you got added to his Contacts list when he sent you that first email. And if you've got a
photo of yourself in your Gmail account, he'll see the trustworthiness of your smiling face and be ready to set up
that appointment—and be able to recognize you when you meet. (This photo also appears in Google Talk, if you
use that—see Chapter 6.)
To add a photo to your Gmail account, first get to the General tab of the Settings page (Settings
General),

and then take these steps:
In the "My picture" section, click the "Select a picture" link.
A box opens that lets you upload an image from your computer, your Picasa Web album ([click here]), or
a Web site (if you store photos on a site like Flickr or Snapfish).
1.
If you're uploading the image from your computer, click Browse, find the photo you want, and then click
Open. If you're adding it from Picasa, Gmail finds your Picasa albums; choose the image from there. If
your image lives elsewhere on the Web, type (or copy and paste) its URL so Gmail can find it.
Whichever method you use, Gmail opens a box displaying your photo, like the one in Figure 5-20. On the
left, it shows the full photo, along with a frame that cordons off the part of the photo that Gmail displays.
On the right, a preview shows how the photo will look in your Gmail account.
2.
Get yourself looking good by adjusting the image. Drag the frame to move it, or drag the handle in the
lower-left corner of the frame to resize the image. When your image is sitting pretty, click Apply Changes.
Gmail adds the image to your Settings page.
3.
Select the lucky people who get to see the image. Turn on the "Visible to everyone" radio button to make
this photo travel with your contact info to all other Gmail users. If you're a little on the shy side, turn on
the "Visible only to people I can chat with" radio button. This means that the only people who can see
your photo are those you've given permission to know when you're online ([click here]). When you're all
done, click Save Changes.
Gmail saves your photo with your contact info.
4.
Figure 5-20. When Gmail first uploads a photo, it may not show you to your best effect. Here, the
part of the image Gmail has selected to display is too low and off-center. Move your cursor over the
left-hand picture till it turns into a four-way arrow (circled), and then drag the frame to move it. You
can also drag the lower-left handle to resize the area Gmail displays.

If you chose "Visible to everyone" in step 4, now when you send an email to anyone else with a Gmail account,
that person can see your photo. For example, when a recipient hovers her cursor over your name while reading
an email (or even while looking at the inbox), your image appears. Your photo also shows up with the rest of
your contact info on the Contacts page ([click here]). And photos aren't just for email. If you use Google Talk
(Chapter 6), your chat partners can also see your photo.
NOTE
Google frowns on images that contain nudity (which are unlikely to do much for your professional
reputation, anyway).
 

 
5.4. Organizing and Searching Your Email
Once you've started using email, it doesn't take long for you to accumulate lots of messages to organize and
manage. And, with all the free storage space Gmail offers, you can easily let mountains of email build up, since
you never have to delete messages just to make more room. Fortunately, Gmail gives you several ways to
organize, save, and find messages in your Gmail account; this section explains 'em all.
5.4.1. Labeling Messages
One of the first things most people say when they start working with Gmail is, "Hey! Where are the folders?"
Gmail doesn't use folders; instead, it organizes your email in two ways:
By gathering back-and-forth emails into conversations ([click here]), which keeps emails and their
responses together.
By letting you create and apply labels to related emails.
Labels are Gmail's improvement on folders (some would argue otherwise, but, hey, it's a free country). When
you stick an email into a folder, it's easy to forget where you put it, making the email hard to find. Labels don't
hide your messages in folders. Plus, you can search by label, immediately bringing all emails with the same
label front and center. Even better, you can stick more than one label on an email. So you don't have to agonize
whether an email about a budget meeting should be labeled budget or meetings—just slap on both labels.
Set up filters ([click here]) to label emails automatically as they arrive in your inbox.
Some people don't like Gmail's labels. They'd prefer to organize their email using folders where they can drag
and drop messages. Folders also allow hierarchical organization (subfolders inside of folders), which labels
don't. If you miss your folders, try labeling email messages then archiving each message as you've read it. This
keeps your inbox uncluttered. When you want to find a labeled email, click the label name in the left-hand
Labels list to show only messages with that label—which is just like looking inside a folder.
5.4.1.1. Create a label
Google gives you two ways to create a new label. The first is on the Settings page's Labels tab:
Figure 5-21. If you've already created labels, they're listed on this page. Click a label's name to see
all messages with that label. To rename or remove an existing label, click the appropriate link to the
label's right (circled). Below the list is the text box you can use to make a new label.

Click Settings
Labels.
Gmail opens the page shown in Figure 5-21, which lists any existing labels.
For a shortcut to the Labels tab, look for the left-hand Labels box on any Gmail
page. Click "Edit labels", and Gmail whisks you to the page shown in Figure 5-21.
1.
In the "Create a new label" text box, type in your new label (it can have up to 40 characters, including
spaces). Labels can group emails by topic (such as grad school or travel), sender (such as family or book
club), or anything that helps you organize your messages. When you're done typing, click Create.
Gmail creates your label and adds it to the list.
2.
Now that you've created your label, you can add it to existing emails ([click here]) or set up a filter ([click
here]) to automatically apply it to new emails that match your filtering criteria.

If you haven't yet read an email with a particular label, Gmail lets you know in the left-
hand Labels box. Labels with unread emails are boldfaced and show you in parentheses
how many emails with that label are unread.
It's even quicker to create a label right from your inbox—or any mailbox where you notice an email you want to
label:
Select the email that will get the new label by turning on the checkbox to its left (you can also select more
than one). Above the list of messages is a drop-down menu called More Actions. Click that, and then
select "New label", as shown in Figure 5-22.
Gmail pops up a box where you can create your new label.
Figure 5-22. Using the More Actions drop-down menu, you can create a new label (or
apply an existing one) to a specific message or group of messages.
1.
Type your label, and then click OK.
Gmail creates your label, and applies it to the email(s) you selected.
2.
5.4.1.2. Apply an existing label to a message
After you've created a label, it's a snap to apply it to an email. Open the mailbox that contains the email (such
as the inbox), and then turn on the message's checkbox to select it. (You can select more than one.) From the
More Actions drop-down menu, choose the label you want to apply, and then Gmail applies it. That's all there is

to it!
5.4.1.3. Edit a label
Labels aren't carved in stone: After you've created a label, you can change it. First get to the Settings page's
Labels tab, either by clicking Settings
Labels, or in any Gmail page's left-hand Labels box, by clicking "Edit
labels" (if you don't see it, click the triangle next to the word "Labels" to expand the Labels box).
Once you're there, find the label you want to change, and then click the "rename" link to its right. A box opens
with the label's current name. Make your changes, and then click OK. Google saves the revised name, and
applies it to all emails with that label.
5.4.1.4. Change a label's color
When you create a label, Gmail assigns it a color—a lovely shade of dark green on light green—to make labels
stand out from everything else in your inbox. After you've created several labels, though, you'll probably want a
way to distinguish them from each other at a glance. (Or maybe you just don't like green.)
You can assign a label a specific color using the left-hand Labels box on any Gmail page. To the right of each
label is a little square that shows the label's background color. (If you haven't assigned a color, the square is
pale gray, so it's hard to see. If you hover your mouse in that general area, you see a small triangle appear
when you're in the right spot.) Click the square to open the box shown in Figure 5-23. Click the color you want
for that label (from gray to fire-engine red), and Gmail applies it.
Figure 5-23. Making different labels different colors helps you tell them apart.

5.4.1.5. Find labeled messages
Here's where labels work almost like folders. You can sort your messages so that Gmail displays only those
messages with a particular label. Look in the left-hand Labels list (click its arrow to expand the list if necessary),
and then click the name of a label. Gmail shows you all messages that have that label.
To find a label fast, bookmark it. Click the label from the left-hand Labels menu (say you
choose a label called Invoices), and the address bar of your browser shows a URL that
looks like this: http://mail.google.com/mail/#label/Invoices. Bookmark the page or add
it to your Internet Explorer Favorites. As long as you're signed in to your Google
Account, opening the bookmark takes you straight to a list of the labeled messages in
Gmail.
5.4.1.6. Remove a label
To remove a label from a particular message, open the mailbox where the message resides, select it, and then
click More Actions. At the bottom of the list that opens, you see a "Remove label" section. Click the name of the
label you want to remove, and Gmail takes it off that message (but it doesn't delete the message).
Alternatively, you can display the list of all messages with a particular label (click Settings
Labels), and then
click the name of the appropriate label. Turn on the checkbox next to any message you want to unlabel, and
then click the "Remove label" button.
5.4.1.7. Delete a label
When a label has outlived its usefulness, you can delete it. Go to the Settings page's Labels tab (either click
Settings
Labels, or go to the left-hand Labels box and click "Edit labels"). On the page that opens, find the
label you want to delete, and then click its right-hand "remove" link. Gmail asks whether you really want to get
rid of the label. Click OK, and it's gone.
NOTE
Deleting a label just gets rid of the label—not the emails it was attached to. To delete emails, see the
instructions on [click here].
5.4.2. Archiving Email
In Gmail, archiving email means that you clear a message or conversation out of your inbox while preserving it
in the All Mail mailbox. All Mail is just what it sounds like: a catchall that holds messages you've received, sent,
and are in the process of writing. The only things you don't find in All Mail are the contents of the Spam and
Trash mailboxes.
You can archive a message (or conversation) from the inbox or from the page where you read the message
itself. If you're in the inbox, tell Gmail which message you want to archive by turning on its checkbox (you can
select as many as you want). Then, click the Archive button at the top or bottom of the inbox. (If you're reading

a message, simply click the Archive button at the top or bottom of that email.) The message disappears from
the inbox, but it's still in All Mail, so you can find it later. Archived messages appear in searches and, if they're
labeled, in the list of messages for a particular label ([click here]).
To archive all messages tagged with a particular label, in the left-hand Labels list, select
the label you want. Gmail shows only the messages with that label. Click All to select
them all, and then More Actions
Archive. Gmail takes those messages out of the
Inbox, so they appear only in All Mail and their label.
To move a message or conversation from All Mail back to your inbox, open All Mail, select the message or
conversation, and then click the "Move to Inbox" button. If you've archived a message and someone replies to
it, then Gmail puts the entire conversation in your inbox.
5.4.3. Searching Email
Gmail brings the power of Google searching to your email account. If you've ever torn your hair out trying to
find a particular email that you just know you saw a couple of weeks ago, you can appreciate what that means.
When you do a search, Gmail whizzes through every single email in your account and shows you those that
contain the word or phrase you're looking for—whether it's in the subject line or the message itself.
If you've ever used Google's search engine (http://www.google.com), you already know how to search in Gmail.
At the top of every Gmail page (to the right of the Gmail logo) is a search box. Type in the word or phrase you
want to find, and then click the Search Mail button. Gmail shows you a list of emails with that word or phrase.
When you open a message from the list, the text you searched for is highlighted in yellow, to help you find it. (If
you don't like the highlighting, you can turn it off. Open one of the emails Gmail found, and in the right-hand
menu, click the "Turn off highlighting" link.)
If you want to broaden your search to include the entire Web, type in your search term,
and then click the "Search the Web" button. Gmail opens a new window to show you
your Google search results, so you don't even have to leave Gmail.
Gmail searches are a little more persnickety than other searches. Gmail doesn't recognize special search
characters like parentheses, brackets, currency symbols (like $ or €), asterisks (*, often used as a wildcard
character), ampersands (&), or pound signs (#). And type carefully: Gmail can't work with partial or similar
matches. For example, you may be used to searching for a partial word like lab and getting back results that
include laboratory and Labrador. That doesn't happen in Gmail, so be exact in your search terms.
Using the search box is great for fast, simple searches. If your search is more complex, with multiple criteria,
then you can take your search to the next level. To do so, just to the right of the "Search the Web" button, click
the tiny "Show search options" link. Gmail expands the search area so you can work with the options shown in
Figure 5-24.
Figure 5-24. Gmail lets you get pretty specific with your search criteria, so you can zero in on the
message you're looking for.

Search Options lets you fine-tune your Gmail search. You can search for text in a specific part of the email, such
as the From, To, or Subject lines, as well as the content of the message. The Search drop-down menu lets you
tell Gmail what to search: a particular mailbox (such as the inbox or the Trash), all starred mail, all read (or
unread) mail, or messages with a particular label. You can also specify a time period for Gmail to search, such
as during the past 6 months or within 2 weeks of March 2, 2009.
5.4.3.1. Search Spam and Trash mailboxes
Ever accidentally throw away something important and then have to go through the trash can looking for it?
Yuck. In Gmail, if you think an important message may have landed in the Trash mailbox, you don't have to go
through all that junk by hand. Similarly, if your Spam mailbox is full to bursting but you wonder if an important
email landed there by mistake, you don't have to scan all those messages about cheap medications and people
who want to be "friends." You can have Gmail do a lightning-fast search of either of these mailboxes—or both.
From any Gmail page, click the "Show search options" link at the top of the page. When you see the Search
Options shown in Figure 5-24, the Search field shows All Mail. Click the down arrow to see more choices, and
then select Spam, Trash, or "Mail & Spam & Trash" from the list—whichever you want to search. Gmail scours
whatever mailboxes you specify for your search terms.
NOTE
When you do a regular search (either via a quick search or by using Search Options), Gmail scans the
Trash mailbox, even if you don't specifically tell it to. If it finds relevant results in Trash, it doesn't
display those messages along with the others it finds. Instead, it puts this message at the end of the
results list: A deleted message matches your search. View it or go to Trash to delete forever. "View it"
and "Trash" are links. Click "View it" to open the message. (If Gmail found more than one Trash
message, then the link says "View them," and clicking it opens a list of the relevant messages.) Click
Trash to open the Trash mailbox.

Power Users' Clinic: Smooth Operators
In the old days, telephone operators helped people's calls get connected smoothly. In Gmail,
advanced search operators perform a similar function, streamlining searching to connect you with
the information you're looking for.
An operator is an instruction that tells Google to perform the search in a certain way, so you can
fine-tune your search to get the results you want. You can also use these operators in Gmail filters
([click here]). Here's a list of the operators you can use for searching and filtering in Gmail, with
an example of each one:
OR. When you're searching for either of two or more words, use OR (make sure you
capitalize both letters). Typing Mary OR Sue tells Gmail to return messages that have either
"Mary" or "Sue" in them—but not necessarily both.
from:. If you're searching for or filtering emails from a specific sender, use this operator. To
tell Gmail to search for emails from your friend Phil, type this in the search box: from:phil.
(Notice there's no space between the operator and the search term.)
to:. Use this operator to tell Gmail to find a particular recipient, like this: to:phil. This
returns all emails in your Gmail account sent to Phil. You don't have to be the one who sent
the message to Phil—Gmail returns messages that were sent to you and Phil from someone
else; just as long as Phil was one of the recipients.
cc:. This operator tells Gmail to search the Cc: field ([click here]) of all messages. If you
sent an email to your sister and Cc'd your mom, typing cc:mom in the search box helps you
find it.
bcc:. This works the same as the cc: operator, except it searches the Bcc: field ([click
here]). This operator can search only emails you've sent; the Bcc field of any messages you
receive is hidden.
subject:. This operator tells Gmail to scan the subject lines of all emails for the word(s) you
specify. For example, typing subject:bill finds all emails with subject lines as Your bill is
attached and Bill is out sick.
label:. This operator works only for messages that have a label ([click here]). If you've
created a label called Family to identify emails from family members, searching for
label:family finds them all for you. (Or you can click Settings
Labels, and then click the
label you want.)
"" (Quotation marks). Slap a pair of quotation marks around a phrase to make Gmail
search for that exact phrase. If you type Missing Manual without the quotation marks, Gmail
would return an email that contains this: "I've been missing my automatic potato peeler. I'm
not a big fan of manual labor." Throw quotation marks around the phrase, however, and
Gmail returns only results with the exact phrase "missing manual" (the words could be
upper- or lowercase).

( ) (Parentheses). Putting parentheses around a group of words tells Gmail to be sure to
include those words in the search. Parentheses help keep things straight when you're
combining operators. For example, from:frank (meeting OR budget) tells Google to search
for all emails from Frank that contain the word meeting, the word budget, or both.
- (hyphen). The hyphen operator works like a – sign, subtracting a particular word from
your search. So searching for opera -phantom would return soap opera but not Phantom of
the Opera.
in:. This tells Gmail to search in a particular mailbox. Examples include in:inbox (to restrict
the search to the inbox) or in:trash (to search just the Trash mailbox). You can also use
in:anywhere to tell Gmail not to leave out any mailboxes. Gmail doesn't search the Spam
and Trash mailboxes unless you tell it to by using in:anywhere, in:trash, or in:spam.
is:. The is: operator directs Gmail to look for messages marked in a particular way. Your
choices are is:read, is:unread, is: starred, and is:chat.
has:attachment. This one's pretty self-explanatory; it looks for messages with at least one
attachment.
filename:. If you want to find a particular attachment (and you know its name), use this
operator. For example, filename:babyphoto.jpg returns the email that has the image file
babyphoto.jpg attached to it.
after: and before:. These operators work together to help you specify a time range within
which Gmail will search. Typing after:2008/05/27 before:2008/05/31 returns all messages
sent on May 28, 29, and 30, 2008. When you use these operators, you have to format your
dates yyyy/mm/dd or Gmail won't understand you.
You can combine operators to give Gmail specific instructions for searching or filtering. For
example, from:mom after:2008/05/31 before: 2008/07/01 "family reunion" finds all the messages
your mom sent during the month of June that mention the family reunion. Before long, you'll be
fluent in operators—and your searches will be more efficient.
5.4.4. Deleting Messages
Google likes to brag that, with the generous amount of storage Gmail provides, you never really need to delete
an email—and they're probably right. But if you're a neat freak who likes to keep your mailboxes spick 'n' span
and you know you won't ever need to see that message again, then you can throw it in the trash. Gmail's Trash
mailbox stores a deleted message for 30 days, and then dumps it forever.
NOTE
When a message is in the Trash, you can work with it just as you could a message in any other mailbox:

read it, label it, report it as spam, and so on. You can even search for it ([click here]). Once the 30-day
limit has passed, though, the message is gone.
How you delete a message depends on where you are. If you see a message in your inbox and you don't even
want to read it, select the message by turning on its checkbox, and then, above the list of messages, click the
Delete button. Gmail tosses it into your Trash mailbox. (You can delete a bunch of messages in one fell swoop
by turning on the checkboxes of all the messages you want to delete.)
If you've got a message open and you want to delete it, then click the Delete button that appears above the
message's subject.
NOTE
Gmail doesn't tell you if there are any unread messages in your Trash mailbox. If you use a filter to route
some email automatically into the trash, you might want to check what's in there once in a while to
make sure you're not throwing out anything important.
Occasionally, you might delete a message by mistake or realize that you threw out a message you still need. To
move a message from Trash back to your inbox, open the Trash mailbox, select the message (turn on its
checkbox), and then click the "Move to Inbox" button. Gmail moves the message to your inbox, and it's like you
never threw it away in the first place.
If you're really into keeping everything tidy, you can empty the Trash yourself instead of waiting 30 days for
Gmail to do it. In the left-hand menu, click Trash to open it. Gmail shows you all the messages currently in the
Trash. To dump specific messages, select them, and then click Delete Forever. To empty the entire mailbox,
click the "Empty Trash now" link.
If you like working with Gmail, spread the word! Invite someone you know to try it. On
the left side of just about any Gmail page is a section called "Invite a friend" (you may
need to scroll down to see it). Type your friend's email address into the "Give Gmail to"
box, and then click Send Invite. Or, if you want to personalize the invitation, click the
Preview Invite link, which opens a box that lets you customize the invitation, and then
send it to numerous email addresses at once. If your friend accepts your invitation,
Gmail sends you a notice to let you know.
 

 
5.5. Dealing with Spam
Gmail does a pretty good job of depositing unwanted emails into your Spam mailbox, so you never even have to
see them. Sometimes, though, an email you want to read lands in the Spam mailbox, or a piece of spam lands
in your inbox, despite Gmail's precautions. You can easily take care of these hiccups in Gmail's spam filtering, as
this section explains.
5.5.1. Get Spam Out of Your Inbox
If you're good friends with a Nigerian prince and regularly exchange emails, that's one thing. But most people
don't want desperate pleas from exiled Nigerian "royalty" cluttering up their inboxes. When you find a spam
email in your inbox, select it by turning on its checkbox, and then click the Report Spam button (above the list
of messages). Gmail moves the offending message to the Spam mailbox, and then dumps it after 30 days.
If you're reading an email and realize it's spam, simply click the Report Spam button
above the message, and the email disappears into your Spam mailbox.
5.5.2. Get Legitimate Email Out of Your Spam Mailbox
If a legit email lands in your Spam mailbox, you don't have to leave it there. Open your Spam mailbox, turn on
the message's checkbox to select it, and then, above the message list, click the Not Spam button. (When you're
in the Spam mailbox, the Report Spam button turns into a Not Spam button.) If you open the message to read
it while still in the Spam mailbox, click the Not Spam button above the message. Either way, Gmail takes the
message out of Spam and puts it in your inbox.
NOTE
Gmail realizes that legit messages sometimes get routed into the Spam mailbox. That's why the left-
hand menu lets you know how many unread messages currently reside in the Spam mailbox: look at the
number in parentheses next to Spam. You might want to give those messages a quick glance whenever
that number reaches 10 or so, just to be sure nothing important has ended up there.
5.5.3. Empty Your Spam Mailbox
Gmail routinely empties your Spam mailbox automatically—if a message sits there for longer than 30 days, it's
toast. But if the very existence of spam makes you nervous, you can get rid of the contents of your Spam
mailbox yourself.
To quickly delete the entire contents of your Spam mailbox, click Spam in the left-hand menu, and then click
the "Delete all spam messages now" link. No more spam (until more arrives).
If you want to pick which messages to delete, open your Spam mailbox, and then select the messages you want
to banish forever by turning on their checkboxes. (To select all the messages in the mailbox, click the All link

just above the list of messages. You can also select messages you've already read, unread messages, and
messages with or without a star by clicking the appropriate link.) Click Delete Forever, and Gmail gets rid of the
messages for good.
If legitimate email from the same person keeps landing in your Spam mailbox, try
adding that sender to your Contacts list ([click here]).
 

 
5.6. Contacts: Your Gmail Address Book
Gmail's Contacts list is like a built-in Rolodex for everyone you email. You can use it to keep track of contact
info for everyone you know: not just their names and email address, but also their phone numbers, addresses,
titles, companies, and more—even photos. This section helps you get the most out of Gmail's Contacts feature.
5.6.1. Managing Contacts
The Contacts link appears in Gmail's left-hand menu, below the list of mailboxes. Click it to go to the Contacts
page, shown in Figure 5-25, which is where you find and manage your contacts.
Figure 5-25. Use Gmail's Contacts page to manage both groups and individual contacts. Click one of
the buttons above the left-hand column to add a new contact or create a contact group.
5.6.1.1. Add a contact
The first time you open your Contacts page, you may find it already lists a number of contacts. How did those
get in there? When you send an email, Gmail assumes that the recipient is someone you might want to contact
again and automatically adds that person to your Contacts list. (To delete a contact, see [click here].) The next
time you write an email to that person, as soon as you start typing in her name or address, Gmail offers

suggestions. Click a suggested name/address to get it in the To line—and save your fingers some typing.
Even though Google takes half the work out of adding contacts, you'll probably want to add more contacts on
your own. It's easy:
On any Gmail page, click the left-hand menu's Contacts link.
Gmail opens the Contacts page.
1.
Click the upper-left New Contact button (it's the one with a + sign and a picture of a person, as you can
see in Figure 5-25).
The far-right column changes to a form for entering contact info, as Figure 5-26 shows.
2.
Type in the info for this contact: name, email address, phone number, street address, and instant
messaging details. Click More Information to expand the section and add title, company, and notes, if you
like. When you're done, click Save.
Gmail adds the contact to your list.
NOTE
When you create a new contact, you need to give Gmail a name OR an email address. As long as
you've typed something into one of those fields, you can add the contact, and then come back and
edit the info later (see [click here]).
3.
Figure 5-26. When you click the New Contact button, Gmail gives you plenty of space to enter all
that person's info. If that person has more than one email address—work and personal, say—click
"add" (circled), and Gmail displays another text box so you can enter both. The same goes for phone
numbers, addresses, instant messaging info, and so on.

5.6.1.2. Import contacts
If you've got a bunch of contact info in a spreadsheet or another email program, you don't have to waste
precious time adding all those contacts to Gmail by hand. You can import the contact info straight into your
Gmail Contacts list. Doing so takes a few steps, but the result is worth the effort.
Mac fans, rejoice! A to G is a tool that quickly and easily exports contacts from your
Apple Address Book. A to G gathers your contacts' names, addresses, email addresses,
phone numbers, companies, job titles, and notes into a into a CSV file that's a cinch to
import into Gmail. Get A to G free at http://bborofka.com/atog.
Importing contacts involves two main steps:
Create a CSV (comma-separated value) file (explained next).
1.
Import the CSV file into Gmail.
2.
The following sections tell you how to complete each step.

5.6.1.2.1. Step 1: Create a CSV file
CSV stands for "comma-separated values," which means a file whose values (pieces of information) are set off
from each other by commas. Fortunately, that doesn't mean you have to type out all your contact info and
manually put commas between each piece of information.
Many email programs—such as Hotmail, Outlook, Yahoo Mail, and Thunderbird—can create a CSV file from your
address book for you. Instructions vary, so use your email program's Help file to export your contacts, and then
skip to Step 2 to get those contacts into Gmail.
If you use a spreadsheet program, such as Excel or Google Docs, to track your contacts, you're in luck.
Exporting a spreadsheet as a CSV file is a piece of cake:
In Excel. Open the spreadsheet that contains your contact info. If you use Excel 2003 or earlier, select
File
Save As to open the Save As box. (In Excel 2007, click the round, upper-left Microsoft Office
button, and then select Save As.) At the bottom of the Save As box, click the "Save as type" drop-down
menu. Scroll down the list that appears until you find "CSV (Comma delimited) (*.csv)". Select that, and
then click Save. Excel may ask you if you're sure you want that format; click Yes. Now you've got a CSV
file to import into Gmail.
In Google Docs. Open the spreadsheet you want to export from, and then select File
Export
.csv.
Google Docs creates a CSV file that holds your data, and opens it in a new browser window. Save the
contents of the browser window, giving it a name like contacts.csv and stashing it somewhere that'll be
easy to find.
5.6.1.2.2. Step 2: Import the CSV file into Gmail
First, make sure that you're logged into your Gmail account. Once you are, it's smooth sailing:
Click the left-hand menu's Contacts link.
Gmail opens the Contacts page, shown back in Figure 5-25.
1.
In the bottom of the first column, click Import.
Gmail displays instructions for importing contacts in the right column, as shown in Figure 5-27.
Figure 5-27. Clicking the Import link at the bottom of the left column opens this form in
the right column, where you can choose the CSV file you want to import.
2.

Click the Browse button to find the file you want to import.
The File Upload box opens.
3.
Locate the CSV file that holds your contacts. Select it, and then click Open to show the file path in the text
box on the Contacts page. Then click Import.
Gmail imports the contacts in the CSV file, and adds them to your Contacts list.
4.

Troubleshooting Moment: Help! My Contacts Won't Import
If you have trouble importing your contacts to Gmail, you can try several things. These questions
can help you zero in on the problem:
Is the file you're importing a CSV file? Make sure that the file extension is .csv, not .xls
or some other spreadsheet file extension. (If you've got the wrong file extension, Gmail tells
you it doesn't recognize that kind of file.)
Is your CSV file formatted properly? The file has to be formatted as a table, with column
headings that define the kinds of information in the file. Without column headings, Gmail
doesn't know where to put the different kinds of information for each contact (name,
address, and so on). If you're importing contacts from a spreadsheet, make sure that each
column has a heading that identifies the kind of information that's in that column.
Do your contacts contain characters from languages other than English? Currently,
Gmail handles only the English character set for imports, which means no characters with
accent marks. If you have lots of international contacts whose info contains characters from
other languages, that'll mess up the import.
Are you just too popular? Gmail can import only 3,000 contacts at a time. If you've got
more than that, break up your CSV file into smaller ones.
Are you trying to import a group? Gmail can't import groups or distribution lists. You'll
have to import contacts as individuals, and then regroup them in Gmail.
5.6.1.3. Edit a contact
After years of talking about it, your best friend finally packed up everything and moved to a cabin in Alaska—but
one with Internet access, so you can still keep in touch. To update his contact info, head to the Contacts page
(as shown in Figure 5-25) by clicking the left-hand Contacts link.
From there, find and select the contact's name in the middle column (if you have lots of contacts and need to
search for the name, see [click here]). When the person's current contact info appears in the right-hand column,
click the Edit button above the name. This step changes the column to the same form you use for adding a
contact (Figure 5-26) but with the current info already filled in. Make whatever changes you need to make, and
then click Save.
5.6.1.4. Create a group of contacts
A contact group is like a mailing list. You can add as many email addresses as you like to a contact group. When
you want to send an email to the group—a newsletter to customers, photos of your new puppy to family
members, a memo to your project team, whatever—you send one email, and Gmail makes sure everyone in
your group gets it.
The Contacts page (Figure 5-25) is the place to go to create a new group. Click the upper-left New Group button
(it looks like a + sign next to a couple of people), and Gmail opens a box asking you to name the group. Type in
a name that'll help you remember who's in the group (High School Reunion Committee is better than Group 4),

and then click OK. Gmail creates the group, and adds it to your Contacts page's left-hand column.
5.6.1.5. Add contacts to a group
When you create a new group, it starts out empty—as Figure 5-28 shows—and an empty group is a lonely party.
Gmail gives you two ways to add people to your group from the Contacts page. One way is to click inside the
"Add to this group" box at the bottom of the middle column, and then type in the name or email address of each
contact you want to add. But this can be time-consuming, because you have to add them one at a time.
Figure 5-28. You can use either of the circled buttons to add people to your new group.
The other way is to add contacts en masse. On the Contacts page, in the left column, click All Contacts to show
all your contacts in the middle column. Select the contacts you want to add to the group by turning on their
checkboxes. When you're done selecting, click the Groups button (it's above the right-hand column, next to the
Edit button). A list drops down, showing all your groups. Choose a group, and Gmail adds those contacts to it.
You can also select the contacts first, and then create a group for them. When you've
chosen a bunch of contacts (or even just one) and then clicked the Groups button, select
"New group" from the drop-down list. A box appears; type in a name for your group,
click the OK button—and you've got a pre-populated group.
5.6.1.6. Send email to a group
Once you've set up a group, you can quickly send everyone in the group email. The easiest way to email a

group is to click Compose Mail, and then, in the To line, type the first few letters of the group's name. Gmail
uses those letters to guess which group you're thinking of. Select the group from Gmail's suggestions, and
Gmail fills in the email addresses of everyone in the group. Then you can add more email addresses or delete a
few (if you want to send an email to almost everyone in the group).
You can also email a group from the Contacts page. In the left-hand column, click the name of the group you
want, and Gmail shows the group's members in the middle column. At the bottom of the middle column, click All
to select everyone in the group. (If you want to send the email to only some members of the group, turn their
checkboxes on one by one.) Then, in the right column, click Email. Gmail opens a Compose Mail page with the
appropriate email addresses already filled in.
Whichever way you got the group's email addresses into the To line, you can then type your message and send
it to everyone in the group.
5.6.1.7. Remove contacts from a group
If you need to remove someone from a group you've created, go to the Contacts page and then, from the left-
hand column, select the group. Then, in the middle column, turn on the checkbox next to the person you want
to remove from the group. Click Groups, and, in the drop-down list, under "Remove from", find the group's
name and click it. That person is out of the group.
NOTE
Removing a contact from a group doesn't delete the contact. To delete a contact, see [click here].
5.6.1.8. Find a contact
Gmail can hold thousands of contacts. When you're that popular, it can be difficult to find one contact among
your legions of fans. Fortunately, Gmail is great at searching.
To find a particular contact, start on the Contacts page and find the "Search all contacts" box (it's next to the
New Group button). Click the box, and then type something to identify the contact you want—all or part of a
name or an email address. As you type, Gmail is already searching.
Gmail creates a temporary Search Results group in the left column, with all matching contacts in the middle
column. If you know half a dozen Freds, for example, Gmail lists them all, making it much easier for you to find
the Fred you want.
5.6.1.9. Add a photo to a contact
Are you great with faces but terrible with names? If so, then this is the feature for you. You can add a photo to
any contact on your list. The photo you choose even replaces (only in your account) whatever photo the contact
may have chosen for himself. So if you're mad at your boss and an image of a horned demon matches your
current feelings about the guy, you can show the demon with his contact info. (Just make sure he's not looking
over your shoulder while the demon's on your screen.) Don't worry—the image doesn't appear on Gmail
messages you send to the big meanie.

To add a photo to a contact, click the left-hand Contacts menu to get to the Contacts page. Then follow these
steps:
In the middle column, find and select the contact you want.
To make that person easier to find, you can search for him ([click here]) or select a group ([click here]) to
which he belongs.
Gmail displays the person's contact info in the right column.
1.
If this person doesn't have a picture yet, click the "Add a picture" link in the right column. Or, if there's
already a picture associated with him, point your cursor at the picture and click "Change Picture".
Gmail opens a box that lets you find and select the picture you want. (It's just like the box for adding a
photo—see [click here].)
2.
Select the photo.
Gmail uploads the photo and shows you what it will look like.
3.
Resize and center the photo as needed ([click here] tells you how to do that). When you're done, click
Apply Changes.
Gmail opens a box like the one in Figure 5-29 that lets you suggest the photo to your contact.
4.
Click "Yes, suggest this picture" to add the photo to the person's contact info in your Gmail account AND
send her an email in your name, showing the photo and suggesting that she use it as her Google photo.
(If she wants to use it, all she has to do is click a link right inside the email.) If you don't want to share
the picture with the person (like that demon picture for your boss), click "No, keep this picture to myself".
Gmail follows your directions and associates that picture with the contact.
5.
Figure 5-29. When you add a photo to one of your contacts, you can share the photo with that
person—or not. If you think your contact might like to use the photo for her Google account,
customize Gmail's message (if you want), and then click the "Yes, suggest this picture" button. If
you want the photo just for your own Gmail account, click "No, keep this picture to myself".

5.6.1.10. Export contacts
If you want to copy your list of contacts (along with all their info) from Gmail to use them in another email
program or to create a spreadsheet, you can export all that contact info with just a few clicks:
On the Contacts page, at the bottom of the left column, click the Export button.
1.
In the right column, Gmail displays the form shown in Figure 5-30.
2.
Tell Gmail which contacts you want to export: all of them or only those in a certain group. Next, specify
the format for the exported file:
Google's CSV format. Turn on this radio button if you're exporting the contact info to another
Google account. For example, if you're transferring contacts from the Gmail account you use at work
to a personal account.
Outlook's CSV format. This format works for Outlook and some other email programs.
vCard format. vCard is like an electronic business card that lets you exchange contact info with
other programs, such as Windows Address Book and many email programs.
3.

When you've made your choices, click the Export button.
Gmail exports your contact info in the format you chose. Be sure to save it somewhere you can easily find
it later on, because you'll need to import it into the other program, such as Excel or Outlook. (Check the
Help files of the other program to find out exactly how to import into it. If you're importing into a different
Gmail account, follow the steps on [click here].)
Figure 5-30. Before you can export contacts from your Gmail account, you need to tell Gmail two
things: which contacts to export and what format to use to export them.
5.6.1.11. Delete a contact
When it's time to say, "So long" to a former contact, you can delete it. Go to the Contacts page, and then find
the contact you want to delete. Select that contact, and then click the upper-right Delete Contact button. Gmail
asks if you're sure you want to get rid of the contact. Click OK, and the contact is gone. (Waving goodbye is
optional.)

NOTE
Once you've deleted a contact, you can't get it back. Of course, you can add the contact all over again,
but you have to start from scratch—see [click here].
 

 
5.7. Customizing Gmail: Your Settings Options
Some people like tailor-made suits. Others are crazy about customized cars. And who doesn't like to create
playlists of their favorite music? Gmail is so easy to use that you can start sending and receiving emails within
mere moments of opening your account. Gmail's also easy to customize, as this section explains.
To start tweaking your settings, go to Gmail and click the upper-right Settings link. Gmail opens the Settings
page, shown in Figure 5-31, which is your customization console for Gmail. Checking out the Settings page is a
good way to get an overview of what you can do in Gmail; the remainder of this chapter fills in the details.
Figure 5-31. When you click the upper-right Settings link, Gmail takes you to this page, which shows
the general settings you can tinker with. You get to other settings by clicking the links across the top
of the page (circled).
5.7.1. General Tab
The Settings page's General tab is a catchall of options that affect your Gmail account:
Language. Gmail supports more than three dozen languages, from Arabic to Vietnamese. You even have
a choice between British and American English. This setting doesn't translate emails you receive; it sets
the language Gmail uses to communicate with you. (Not a bad way to practice your French before that
vacation to Paris, no?)

Maximum page size. This sets the number of conversations ([click here]) that appear in your inbox.
Your choices are 25, 50, and 100.
Keyboard shortcuts. If you're a fast typist who hates lifting your hands from the keyboard to fool around
with the mouse, turn on the "Keyboard shortcuts on" radio button. Then take a look at the Appendix to
see which keyboard shortcuts you can use with Gmail.
My picture. If you want, you can attach a photo to your Gmail account. To upload an image into Gmail,
click the "Select a picture" link, and then follow the steps on [click here]. If you do that, the photo appears
when another Gmailer hovers the cursor over your name in his inbox or Contacts list.
Contacts' pictures. If you want to see photos of other Gmailers, then leave the "Show all pictures" radio
button turned on. If you don't, then turn on the radio button labeled "Only show pictures that I've chosen
for my contacts", which blocks photos other Gmailers have chosen.
Hate the goofy-looking photo that appears in every email from your spouse?
Upload a better one—[click here] shows you how.
Signature. If you've got contact info, a notable quote, or a witty saying that you want to tack onto the
end of your outgoing emails, turn on the radio button next to this text box, and then type it in. If you
prefer a minimalist look, leave the "No signature" radio button turned on.
Gmail doesn't spell check your signature—it just adds what you type to the end of
your emails. So if you use a signature, make sure you proofread it carefully. You
don't want a typo to stain every email you send.
Personal level indicators. Gmail can add little arrow characters to emails you receive to show whether
the email was sent to a mailing list or to you, personally. One arrow (>) means it was sent to you and a
group of others; two arrows (>>) means it was sent only to you; and no arrows mean it was sent to a
mailing list. Turn on the "Show indicators" radio button if you want this info.
Snippets. A snippet is part of the first line of an email—it gives you a preview of the email's content. If
you want to see snippets in your inbox, leave the "Show snippets" radio button turned on. If you'd rather
see only the subject lines of emails, then turn on "No snippets".
Vacation responder. Heading for tropical shores or the bright lights of an exciting city? Lucky you. Since
all you need to check your Gmail is Internet access and a Web browser, you could keep up with email
while you're away. But who needs to think about email while they're basking on the beach or checking out
the sights? When you're going to be away from Gmail for a while (even if it's just for an all-day meeting),
type in the subject line and message you want Gmail to send to people who email you while you're gone.
Typing in these text boxes automatically turns on the "Vacation responder on" radio button, putting your
vacation email into effect as soon as you click the Save Changes button at the bottom of the page. (Don't
forget to come back to the Settings page and turn off vacation responder after you get back.)

Outgoing email encoding. Whenever you send an email, Gmail selects the character set (letters,
numbers, punctuation marks, and symbols) appropriate to the language you used. This process is called
encoding, and it tells Web browsers and email applications how to display your email. Most of the time you
can stick with Gmail's default encoding. But if people are telling you your emails look like gobbledygook,
try turning on the "Use Unicode (UTF-8) encoding for outgoing messages" radio button. Unicode is an
encoding method that encompasses all of the world's currently spoken languages, and using it can help to
ensure your emails look the way they're supposed to when they land in someone's inbox.
If you've changed any settings, click the Save Changes button at the bottom of the page to keep your new
settings, or click Cancel to ignore them.
5.7.2. Accounts Tab
If you have more than one email address (maybe you've got one for work, another for friends and family, and a
third for your work as treasurer of the Bronzed Baby Shoes Collectors Club), you can manage them from the
Accounts tab of the setting page, shown in Figure 5-32. (They don't all have to be Gmail accounts.)
Figure 5-32. You manage Gmail accounts—as well as other email accounts—from this page. You can
also get to your personal Google Account page by clicking the Google Account Settings link (circled).
(You automatically get a Google Account when you sign up for Gmail.)
The Accounts tab has the following sections:
Send mail as. You can send mail from Gmail using the From address of a different email account. This
can be handy when you don't have access to your desktop computer (and its email program). Step-by-
step instructions for pulling off this neat trick are covered back on [click here].

Add additional storage. For plain-vanilla emails, Gmail offers more storage space than you could ever
possibly need—and it's increasing all the time. But if you receive a lot of emails with attached photos or
video clips, those attachments can eat up your storage space—so Google lets you buy more. If you're
about to run out of Gmail storage (check the percentage of your storage space you're using, listed here),
click the "Upgrade your storage" link. A new window opens, telling you how much storage you're using and
letting you add to it. Currently, expanded storage plans range from 10GB to 400GB and cost between $20
and $500 per year.
NOTE
If you use Google's Picasa Web albums ([click here]) to store and share photos, any storage space
that you buy for your Gmail account gets shared between Gmail and Picasa.
Get mail from other accounts. Want Gmail to fetch your messages from another email account? Click
"Add another mail account" and follow the steps on [click here]. This is a good way to keep all your emails
in one place, so you don't have to check a bunch of different email accounts every day. Gmail keeps
fetching messages until you tell it to stop.
Google Account settings. Clicking this link takes you to your Google Account page ([click here]), which
displays your personal info and the Google offerings that currently make up your account (Gmail, Google
Docs, and so on). From there, you can change your password and security question, jump to another
Google site, or sign up for Google service you haven't tried yet, like Google Docs or Blogger.
Have your own domain? Your domain is your Web site's address, such as yourname.com or
buymyproduct.com. If you've got a Web site, you can use Gmail with it (see [click here] for details).
5.7.3. Labels Tab
As explained earlier, Gmail labels help you organize your emails. When you create a label—say, Marketing
Strategy or Family News—you can apply that label to relevant emails, making them easy to find. The Settings
page's Labels tab is where you create labels (you can also create them from your inbox). And once you've
created a few, you can see and manage them here, too. For the full scoop on label-making, see [click here].
Want a shortcut to the Labels tab? On any Gmail page, go to the left-hand menu, and
then click the "Edit labels" link. (If you don't see the link, click Labels to expand the
menu's Labels section.) Click it, and you jump straight to the Labels tab.
5.7.4. Filters Tab
Earlier in this chapter you met filters, which work like a nightclub bouncer for your inbox: Some messages get
A-list treatment, others have to wait their turn, and some don't get in at all. Using filters, you can have Gmail
automatically label, star, archive, delete, or forward messages, based on a keyword, the sender, and so on. If
you have any filters set up, then you can view and edit them here, as shown in Figure 5-33 ([click here] gives

you all the details about how to create and work with Gmail filters).
Figure 5-33. The Filters tab shows any filters you've set up. (When you first create your Gmail
account, the filters list is empty.) The first filter listed here adds a star to any email with the words
production meeting in the subject line; the second sends all emails from stalker@creepy.com straight
to the trash. To create a new filter, click the "Create a filter link" at the top or bottom of the page
(both circled)—and check out [click here].
5.7.5. Forwarding and POP/IMAP Tab
You can set up Gmail to forward your emails to another email account. You can even forward emails and keep a
copy of them in Gmail. The "Forwarding and POP/IMAP" tab of the Settings page, shown in Figure 5-34, is where
you tell Gmail how and where to forward your mail. As intimidating as those acronyms might make it sound,
your options on this tab are actually pretty straightforward:
Figure 5-34. Here's where you can tell Gmail you want your email forwarded somewhere else. It's
easy to do—the numbered steps help you keep track of exactly what you need to do.

Forwarding. If you want to forward your Gmail, turn on the "Forward a copy of incoming mail" radio
button, type in the email address you want your messages to go to, and then tell Gmail what else to do
with those messages: keep a copy in your Gmail inbox, archive a copy, or delete it from Gmail. Simple,
huh?
If you want to forward only some of your emails to another account—for example,
you want to make sure that the emails your Mom keeps sending you at work go to
your personal account—set up a filter ([click here]) to send those particular emails
on.
POP Download. POP stands for "post office protocol," and it's a way of getting your emails from a
centrally located mail server onto your computer. Best of all, you don't have to understand the nitty-gritty
of how it work to take advantage of it. You can use POP to send mail from your Gmail account to another
email program, such as Outlook or Eudora, so you can read those emails even when you aren't connected
to the Internet. Just turn on POP, and then tell Google whether you want to transfer all the mail in your
Gmail account, or just the mail that arrives from now on. For more on POP, see the box on [click here].
IMAP Access. Like POP, IMAP is a way of transferring mail to another email program, so you can see
your messages when you're offline. (In case you were wondering, it stands for "Internet message access
protocol;" see the box on [click here] for more details on why corporate types with multiple computers
tend to love IMAP). To use IMAP to transfer your email, turn on the Enable IMAP radio button.
Configuration instructions. Whether you use POP or IMAP to transfer your email, you need to set up the

email program that will receive the messages from Gmail. Click the appropriate "configuration
instructions" link to get instructions for your specific program or device, from Outlook and Apple Mail to
your iPhone or Blackberry.
If you make any changes to the settings on this tab, remember to click the Save Changes tab at the bottom of
the page.
Up to Speed: POP vs. IMAP
POP and IMAP sound a bit like Batman expletives and a mapping program from Apple. But as
explained above, they're two different ways to transfer email from Gmail to an email program on
your computer. Most email programs these days let you use either one. So what are the
differences between them, and why would you choose one over the other?
POP stands for "post office protocol," and this is the way most people get email; it's a favorite
protocol of many Internet service providers. POP is well-named, because it works kind of like a
post office. With a post-office box, your mail sits in the box until you go and pick it up. With POP, a
mail-server computer hangs on to your email until your computer picks it up.
When your email program checks your mail using POP, the program sends your password to the
mail server, along with a request for any new messages. If you've got mail waiting, the server
delivers those messages to your computer. When it delivers your messages, the mail server
deletes its own copies to make room for more mail. (Kind of like the postmaster doesn't hang on
to a copy of every letter you get.)
IMAP, or "Internet message access protocol," treats mail differently. With IMAP, after you've read
your messages, they stay on the server until you delete them. That gives you a lot of flexibility in
getting and reading your mail. For example, you can check your email at work, and then check it
again from your cellphone on the way home. Later that evening, you might check it one more time
from your home computer. IMAP lets you get your mail from any device, anywhere, any time. With
POP, once your email gets delivered to your computer, you have to read it from that computer. In
a nutshell, POP transfers email, taking it off one computer and putting it on another, while IMAP
lets you get to your email from just about anywhere. If you want ready access to your email from
work, home, your phone, your laptop, IMAP is the way to go.
5.7.6. Chat Tab
When email burst onto the scene, the old way of sending mail—you know, with paper and stamps and a mail
carrier—suddenly seemed unbearably slow. The advent of instant messaging has had the same effect on email.
Who wants to wait around for somebody to answer an email when you can communicate with them in real time
using chat, Gmail's instant messaging feature? Gmail chat lets you chat with anyone in the Google Talk network,
and you don't even have to leave Gmail to use it.
To use chat, head to the left-hand Chat box. Click somebody's name to open a chat window, type in your
message, hit Enter, and then see what they say back. (Another instant messaging option from Google is Google
Talk, which is covered in Chapter 6.)

The Chat tab of Gmail's Setting page (shown in Figure 5-35) lets you determine how you'll chat using Gmail:
Chat history. If you like to save your chats and read them again later (you are awfully witty, after all),
then turn on the "Save chat history in my Gmail account" radio button. Gmail saves your chats, filing them
(sensibly) under Chats, where you can read and search them. If you don't want to save chats, then turn
on the "Don't save chat history in my Gmail account" radio button.
If you want Gmail to stop recording part of a chat, you can take the chat off the
record. During the chat, click Options, and then select "Go off the record". Later, if
you want to start recording the chat again, click Options
"Stop chatting on the
record"; [click here] explains more about chatting off the record.
Figure 5-35. Tweak your chat settings here, from saving chats to adding sounds and emoticons.
Chat list location. Your list of fellow chatters can appear either above or below the Labels box on the left
side of Gmail pages. Specify your preferences here.
Auto-add suggested contacts. When Gmail notices you have a lot of email conversations with
somebody, it thinks that person would make a good chat partner, as well. If you want to let Gmail
automatically add certain contacts to your Chat list, so that they can see when you're online and initiate
chats, leave the "Automatically allow..." radio button turned on. If you'd prefer that only people you've
okayed get to chat with you and see when you're online, turn on the "Only allow people that I've explicitly
approved..." radio button.

Sounds. You can tell Gmail to play a sound to alert you when a new chat message arrives—or not. Set
your preference here. (Sounds are turned on unless you change this setting.)
Emoticons. If you're big on smiley faces, frowny faces, and tongue-sticking-out faces to enhance your
chats, turn emoticons on here. When you turn on the "Emoticons on" radio button, if you type :-) into a
chat message, it magically turns into  .
AIM. If you use AOL Instant Messenger to chat with friends, you can make AIM and Gmail chat work
together. Import your AIM buddy list into Gmail chat, sign into AIM right from Gmail, and then start
chatting away; [click here] gives you all the details.
Click the Save Changes button when you've got this tab's settings how you want them.
Chapter 6 is all about Google Talk. To learn more about chatting in Gmail (which uses
the Google Talk gadget), see [click here].
5.7.7. Web Clips Tab
Web clips are the messages automatically piped in by Google that appear above your Gmail inbox. They change
as you navigate Gmail or refresh your inbox. A Web clip might be a news story, an ad, or a tip about using
Gmail. In Figure 5-1, for example, you can see a Web clip that points to a Business Week article about iPhones.
When you click a Web clip, a new window opens, showing the news story or advertiser's Web site.
If you don't want Web clips cluttering up your screen, turn them off on the Settings page's Web Clips tab, shown
in Figure 5-36. Just turn off the "Show my web clips above the Inbox" checkbox. Or you can customize your
Web clips by choosing from a variety of sources related to just about every interest you could possibly imagine:
from news and finance to recipes and trivia.
Figure 5-36. Turn on the checkboxes of any interesting-looking Web clips, or browse the categories
listed on the left (News, Business, and so on).

 

 
Chapter 6. Keeping in Touch with Google Talk
Remember when email came along and pretty much killed letter writing? Memo to email: Watch your back.
Instant messaging—often called IM (pronounced "eye-em" by those in the know)—isn't just for kids anymore.
So what is IM and why would you want to use it? Say you have a question for a co-worker and need an answer
now. That's where instant messaging (emphasis on instant) comes in. If you and your colleague are both online,
you can open a chat window, ask your question, and get an answer—all in mere seconds. It's also great for
those long and otherwise tedious email exchanges that go something like: "You free at 2:30 to talk about
Jenkins?" "No. How 'bout 4?" "I can't. Maybe next week?" And so on.
Of course, chatting can be fun, too. When you see a friend or family member online, you can lob a quick hi and
exchange news, even as you work or surf the Web.
Google Talk is Google's foray into the world of instant messaging. If you've used other chat programs, like AOL
Instant Messenger (AIM) or Windows Live Messenger, you'll easily find your way around Google Talk. Even if
you're new to chatting, you'll find Google Talk simple to use. (So far, the full version of Google Talk is for
Windows users only, but Mac and Linux users aren't totally out of luck—see the box on [click here] for details.)
If you use Gmail (Chapter 5), you'll love the way Talk integrates with your Gmail account: sharing contacts,
saving chats, and more. And Talk is about way more than just chatting. You can use it to transfer files, make
free computer-to-computer voice calls, and send and receive voicemail messages. You can even listen to those
voicemail messages right in Gmail.
So what are you waiting for? Read on to become an instant IM pro and add a whole new dimension to
collaborating and staying in touch.
NOTE
You have two ways to chat using Google Talk: the Google Talk client, which you download to your
computer, and the Google Talk gadget, which lives on a Web page, so you can use it from any computer.
The box on [click here] outlines the differences between these two ways of chatting.
6.1. Getting Started with Google Talk
To use Google Talk, you need a Google Account. If you use Gmail, Google Docs, Google Calendar, or any other
Google offering that requires you to sign in, you've already got one. If you don't, Chapter 1 walks you through
the process.
You also need to make sure your computer meets these basic requirements:
Your computer's operating system is Windows 2000, XP, or Vista, or Windows Server 2003.

Your Internet connection must be at least a 56K dial-up connection. But you'll find that Google Talk works
better and faster if you have a broadband connection such as DSL or cable.
NOTE
If you have a Mac or use Linux, the Google Talk client doesn't work on your computer (as of this writing,
anyway—Google says they're working on it). But you can still use the Google Talk gadget. See the box
on [click here] for the details.
Finally, if you plan to use Google Talk to make free voice calls over the Internet ([click here]), you need one of
these:
A microphone and speakers, or
A headset that includes a microphone.
For clarity in both transmitting and receiving, a headset with a noise-canceling
microphone is your best choice. Many headsets connect to your computer via a
USB port. Logitech, Genius, and Panasonic all offer affordable headsets.
Up to Speed: The Two Flavors of Google Talk
Throughout this chapter, you'll see references to the Google Talk client and the Google Talk
gadget. What's the difference?
The Google Talk client is a program that you download to your computer so that you can send and
receive instant messages and over-the-Internet voice calls. You need a recent version of Windows
([click here]) to use Google's talk client.
On the other hand, Google Talk gadget works without having to download and install anything on
your computer. Using a fairly simple procedure (described on [click here]), you embed the Google
Talk gadget (a mini-program-within-a-window) on a Web page, such as iGoogle (Chapter 8) or
your own site. Because the gadget lives online, you can use it no matter what kind of computer
you have: Mac, Linux, Windows, whatever.
Currently, the gadget is a stripped-down version of the Google Talk client: You can chat and, if you
have a Gmail account, get chat histories and messages sent to you when you're not connected to
the Internet. Here's what the gadget can't currently do: transfer files, send messages to others
who aren't connected to the Internet, make voice calls (unless you've got the client running at the

same time), or show music status messages. (This chapter explains how to do all these things with
the client.)
Even so, the Google Talk gadget does a couple of cool things that the client can't do. The biggie is
that you can use the gadget to invite a whole group of friends to the same chat; client chats are
limited to one friend at a time. Also, you can use the gadget to show Google Video or YouTube
videos, or Picasa or Flickr slideshows, right in the chat window.
For more about using the Google Talk gadget, see [click here].
6.1.1. Using Google Talk with Other IM Programs
You can choose from a bunch of different instant messaging networks, and not all of them can talk with each
other. People pick their service based on the one most of their friends use. The great thing about Google Talk is
that it runs on the Jabber service, an open source network that also talks to these (and other) services:
Adium
iChat
Kopete
Miranda
Pidgin
Psi
Trillian Pro
If one of these programs is already your favorite instant-messaging program, you can set it up to connect to
Google Talk. So if you've already got a favorite instant-messaging program, you might prefer to use that one
instead. The steps for setting up your IM program to work with the Google Talk network vary, depending on
your program. For step-by-step instructions, visit www.google.com/talk/otherclients.html, find your IM client in
the table, and then click its name.
Why would you want to connect your IM program to the Google Talk network? Simple. Google Talk shares an
address book with your other Google applications, like Gmail, so you can easily connect with friends and
colleagues.

If you use Gmail, you can chat with your AOL Instant Messenger buddies through
Gmail's version of Google Talk; [click here] tells you how.
Frequently Asked Question: Google Talk and Privacy
Are there any privacy risks associated with using Google Talk?
Google's privacy policy (see the box on [click here]) spells out how it treats your personal
information, and what it does with that info. Here are the main points of the policy as it relates to
chatting:
As you chat, Google may record information about how you're using Talk, including the size of
your Friends list ([click here]), which contacts you communicate with, how often you transfer files,
and how big those files are. In addition, Google keeps track of how you work with Talk: the
settings you choose, the buttons you click, and so on. Finally, if you use chat history ([click here]),
your chats get logged and emailed to your Gmail account. Google doesn't, however, save chat logs
elsewhere.
How does Google use the information it collects? Some of that info is necessary to show your
online presence (whether you're online or not) and status (whether you're available or too busy to
chat right now) to your friends and colleagues. In addition, Google analyzes how you use Talk in
order to improve it. You may be comforted to know that Google says it regularly deletes the
information it collects about Talk users' activity.
You have some control over whether Google saves the contents of your chats. You can turn off
chat history by going to Settings
Chat, and then turning on the "Don't save chat history in my
Gmail account" radio button. Or, in your Gmail account, choose Settings
Chat, turn on the
"Don't save chat history in my Gmail account" radio button, and then click Save Changes. Even if
you tell Google not to save your chats, though, your chat partners can still save chats in which you
participate. To really make sure that nobody logs a chat, take it off the record ([click here]).
If you use chat history, Gmail scans incoming chats for keywords just as it does other email, so it
can display ads related to the content of your chats. (The box on [click here] explains about
targeted ads in Gmail.)
6.1.2. Downloading Google Talk
To download Google Talk and start chatting, head over to www.google.com/talk (see Figure 6-1). Click the big
blue Download Google Talk button.
Figure 6-1. You can't miss the big Download Google Talk button. Click it to start the download and
installation process, which takes less than a minute if you've got a high-speed Internet connection.

A thank-you page opens. (If your download doesn't begin automatically, click the "Click here" link to start the
download.) Your browser opens a box to ask how you want to handle the download. If you're using Internet
Explorer, click Run; in Firefox, click Save File. In Internet Explorer, the Google Talk installation starts
automatically. In Firefox, double-click the installation file on your Desktop, and then agree to Google's terms of
service (see [click here]) to start the installation. It's quick—in fact, if you blink you might miss it. Click Finish at
the end of the Installation Wizard, and Google Talk opens, ready for you sign in—head to [click here] to learn
how.
6.1.2.1. Download Google Talk to your Blackberry
If your BlackBerry is as necessary to you as oxygen, you're gonna love this. You can download Google Talk to
your BlackBerry and use it to chat while you do all those things that make your BlackBerry so indispensable:
check your email, listen to music, navigate a route, play a round of Frogger, whatever.
To get Google Talk onto your BlackBerry, download it at www.blackberry.com/googletalk. After you've installed
Google Talk, sign into your Google Account. Now you can access and add to your Google Talk contact list, see
who's online, and send and get instant messages. And your BlackBerry home screen lets you know when you've
got a new message. Pretty cool, huh?
6.1.3. Signing In
The Google Talk sign-in window, shown in Figure 6-2, is where you sign into launch Google Talk. Here's a quick
tour:
Username. If you have a Gmail account, this is the part of your address that comes before @gmail.com.
If you don't have Gmail, the user name is the nickname you provided when you created your Google Talk

account.
Password. Type your Google Account password here.
Remember password. Turn on this checkbox if you're the only one who uses this computer and you
don't want the hassle of entering your password every time you sign in. But if security is a concern, or if
you're using Google Talk on a shared computer, turn this checkbox off.
Once you've entered your user name and password, click the big Sign In button to open Google Talk.
Figure 6-2. Use your Google Account or Gmail login info to sign into Google Talk.

If you're having trouble signing in to Google Talk, the problem may be with your
firewall, the security filter that protects your computer from bad stuff on the Internet.
Google offers step-by-step help for getting your firewall to play nice with Google Talk, if
you use McAfee Personal Firewall, Norton Personal Firewall, PC-Cillin Internet Security,
Tiny Personal Firewall, or ZoneAlarm. To find out how to adjust your firewall's settings,
go to www.google.com/support/talk to get to Talk's Help page. In the Troubleshooting
section, click "Setting Up and Signing In"
"I have a firewall and can't connect to
Google Talk. Help!" From there, find your firewall, and then click its name to get specific
instructions.
6.1.4. Sending a Message
Figure 6-3 shows what you see when you sign into Google Talk: your Friends list—a roster of friends,
colleagues, and family members with whom you might want to chat. You can chat only with people who appear
on this list ([click here] tells you how to add your friends). If you use Gmail, Google Talk automatically shows
your Gmail contacts here. Contacts you've chatted with in the past (when collaborating in Google Docs, for
example) also appear as chat partners. For these people, you can see a picture (if they've chosen one) and their
status: Available, Idle, Busy, or Offline. Other contacts appear on the list, too, but you have to invite them to
use Google Talk ([click here]) before you can chat with them.
Figure 6-3. Your Google Talk Friends list shows you the status of your friends and contacts.

If you see the word "Available" below someone's name, that's tantamount to her declaring: "Hey everyone, I'm
ready to chat." Put your cursor over the person's name, and a new window with her contact info flies out, as
shown in Figure 6-4. Google calls this a profile card. In the profile card, click the Chat button to open a chat
window like the one in Figure 6-5.
Figure 6-4. When you put your cursor over someone's name, you see that person's profile card (her
email address is at the bottom of the box). Click the email address to open your email program and
send an email, or click Chat (circled), Call, or Send Files (which appears only if your friend is online
now).

To launch a chat even faster, just click a person's name in your Friends list, and Google
opens a chat window.
Figure 6-5. Google Talk's chat window is a cinch to use: Type in a message at the bottom, hit Enter,
and your message appears in the chat area.

In the chat window, type your message in the narrow text box at the bottom, and then hit Enter. Your message
appears in the chat area, above where you typed. At the same time, the message appears on your friend's
monitor in a chat window. When your friend answers, her message appears in your chat window and (depending
on your settings [[click here]]) a tone alerts you that you've got a message. And so it goes, back and forth, for
as long as you continue to chat.
6.1.5. Personalizing Google Talk
Chatting is pretty basic—you and a friend exchange witty messages back and forth. But "basic" doesn't
necessarily mean "boring." You can add flavor to Google Talk by personalizing it: add a photo, a funny (or
informative) status message, or a different theme to the chat display. You may be surprised at the ways you
can spiff up your Talk account.
6.1.5.1. Set your status
When you've installed Google Talk and signed in, Talk automatically sets your status to Available, meaning
people on your Friends list can see that you're online and ready to chat. You can tell if someone's available
because Talk displays a green-for-go circle and the word Available by his name, as Figure 6-6 shows. You can
also set your status to Busy, letting online friends know that now isn't a good time to chat, or create a custom
message.
Figure 6-6. Your current chat status (circled) shows up just below your name. To change your status,
click the down arrow and choose from the drop-down list. When you create a custom status
message, that message appears on the list the next time you click the drop arrow—it's equivalent to
hanging a note on your office door: On the Phone, In a Meeting, Hiding Under My Desk—whatever
you want to say.

To set your status, click the down arrow next to your current status at the top of your Friends list. This opens
the drop-down list shown in Figure 6-6. Select a status from the list, and it appears in the main Talk
window—and also on all your contacts' Friends lists.
The built-in status choices are pretty basic: Available, Busy, or showing whatever music you're currently
listening to. (See the box on [click here] for more about Google Music Trends.) You can write a custom message
that tells your friends and colleagues what you're actually doing right now, like On a conference call or Back at
3:30 or Moved to Rio to escape the snow. By giving a bit more info than Busy or Available, a custom message
gives other chatters a reason to contact you or leave you alone.
NOTE
If you're away from your computer for 5 minutes or so, your status changes to Idle, represented by an

orange clock icon. This icon lets your contacts know that you're not at your computer and may not
answer a chat message or voice call. When you get back to your computer, your Idle status changes
back to the most recent status you chose.
To create a custom message, click the down arrow next to your current status, and then, from the drop-down
list, choose one of the "Custom message" items. If you want to create an Available message (showing the green
Available icon), then pick the first item; if you want to create a Busy message (showing the red Busy icon, which
looks like a "Do not enter" traffic sign), then pick the second. When you make your selection, your current
status changes to a text box. Type in your message, and then hit Enter. Your current status changes, for you
and all your contacts to see.
Talk automatically creates two versions of your custom message (one for Busy and one for Available), which
both appear in the status drop-down list. So if you want to keep your custom message but switch from Available
to Busy (or vice versa), just click the down arrow and make your selection.
If you create a lot of custom messages, the status drop-down list can get pretty long. To clear custom
messages, select "Clear custom messages". (This option appears in the status menu only when you've created
at least one custom message.) When you do, Talk deletes all your custom messages.
When you set your status to Busy, your contacts can still initiate a chat. (Some people
can't take a hint, or haven't yet read this chapter.) So if you're really busy and don't
want to be distracted, pull Talk's plug by signing out. When you do so, your status
changes to Offline in your contacts' Friends lists. They can send you a voicemail ([click
here]) or offline message ([click here]), but can't try to chat with you.
Frequently Asked Question: Google Music Trends
There's an option on the Google Talk status menu called "Show current music track". What's that
about?
Lots of people listen to music on their computers as they work, chat, and surf. You can share your
musical tastes with the world by clicking the down arrow next to your current status, and then,
from your status list, selecting one of the "Show current music track" items. Talk displays the
green or red status icon, depending on which item you chose, to show whether you're busy or
ready for a chat. But instead of the usual Available or Busy status message, it shows whatever
music you're playing on your computer right now.
Music players that work with this feature include iTunes, Windows Media Player, Winamp, and the
Yahoo Music Engine. When you're not listening to music, Talk shows your status as Available or
Busy, depending on which "Show current music track" item you chose.
If you want, you can also participate in Google Music Trends, a project of Google Labs. Google
Music Trends collects (and makes anonymous) info about the music Google Talk users are listening
to, and displays the results at www.google.com/trends/music. Google Music Trends shows the
most popular tracks by genre, and you can click a song to learn more about it through Google
Music Search. So every time you play a song, it's like you're casting a vote for it.

To tell Google Music Trends about your musical tastes, click Settings
Audio, and then turn on
the checkbox labeled "Share music listening history with Google Music Trends". You can come back
to the Settings box and turn off this checkbox at any time to stop sharing.
6.1.5.2. Add a photo or picture
If you're a Gmail fan and you've added a photo to your Gmail account ([click here]), then you'll find that when
you install Google Talk, your Gmail photo appears as an thumbnail-sized picture of you for Google Talk.
Depending on your settings (explained in the next section), that picture appears next to each comment you
make during a chat. If you don't add a photo or other image, your picture is a unisex silhouette—kind of boring,
unless your online persona is The Shadow.
You can change your Google Talk avatar as often (or as seldom) as you like—from the formal portrait on your
business card to a vacation snapshot to a goofy cartoon character. To upload an image to use as your picture,
follow these steps:
Hover your cursor over your current picture at the top of the main Talk window.
A down arrow appears at the bottom of the image.
1.
Click the down arrow.
Talk displays a bunch of cartoon images and any pictures you've uploaded and used in the past. Figure 6-
7 shows an example.
2.
Figure 6-7. If you've ever wanted to be a frog or a monkey, select one of Google Talk's built-in
cartoons as your picture. Otherwise, click "More pictures" at the bottom of the box to upload your
own image.

Click "More pictures" at the bottom of the selection menu.
A box opens that lets you browse for files on your computer.
0.
Find and select the image you want to upload (it can be a .jpg, .gif, .bmp, or .png file), and then click
Open.
Talk automatically resizes your image to the right dimensions, and makes it your picture.
1.
After you've uploaded an image, it's added to the list of pictures you can choose from. So if you want to switch
from today's picture to the one you used last week, just put your cursor over your current picture, click the
down arrow that appears, and then, from the menu that appears, choose the picture you want.

If you have a Gmail account, the picture you choose for Talk also appears in Gmail.
(When your name appears on somebody's Gmail Contacts list, your picture appears with
it.) If you want a avatar in Talk but not in Gmail, open Gmail, and then click Settings. In
the "My picture" section of the General tab, turn on the "Visible only to people I can chat
with" radio button. This makes it so your picture appears only in chat sessions, not
people's Contacts lists.
6.1.5.3. Choose a theme
When you start using Google Talk, the chat window is preset to a style called Classic Picture (turn back to
Figure 6-5 to see what it looks like). This theme shows the pictures you and your chat partners use to the left of
what each person types. Text appears on a plain white background.
Talk gives you several themes to choose from. To check 'em out and pick a new theme, go to the main Talk
window (the one that shows your Friends list), and then click Settings
Appearance. In the box that opens,
click the Chat Theme drop-down list to see the various styles (Figure 6-8). Most themes have two
versions—with pictures or without. Pick a theme to see a preview of it below the drop-down menu.
Figure 6-8. Here's the current list of themes from which Google Talk lets you choose. Pick one to see
a preview of it.

6.1.6. Google Talk's Preferences
You can start chatting away within seconds of downloading Google Talk. Or, you can take a few seconds longer
and change the Google Talk settings that control things like message notifications, and whether to show or hide
friends who aren't online right now. To do that, at the top of the main Google Talk window (the one that shows
your contacts), click the Settings link, and then tweak away (Figure 6-9).
Figure 6-9. Talk's General Settings page lets you set preferences about starting up, responding to
email links, what your Friends list looks like, and the font Google Talk uses.

6.1.6.1. General
Here's where you adjust these miscellaneous settings:
Start automatically when starting Windows. If you don't want to miss a second of chat time, leave
this checkbox turned on, and Google Talk opens as soon as you start Windows. If you turn off this
checkbox, you have to start Google Talk yourself ([click here]) when you're ready to chat.
If you really want to get chatting right away, turn on the "Remember password"
checkbox when you sign in. When Google Talk starts up, you're signed in and ready
to go.
Open Gmail when I click on email links. Turning on this checkbox makes Gmail open automatically
when you click someone's email address in your Friends list.
Sort by name. Turn on this checkbox if you want the names in your Friends list to be in alphabetical
order.

Hide offline friends. To see only those friends who are currently online, turn on this checkbox.
Hide Google address book contacts not on my Google Talk friends list. If you use Gmail, Google
takes your Contacts from your address book and adds them to your Google Talk Friends list. But some of
those contacts you won't ever chat with, like subscriptions@myfavoritemagazine.com or
info@localstore.com. To see only the people you've agreed to chat with, turn on this checkbox.
Add people I communicate with often to my Friends list. This checkbox is automatically turned on to
make sure your top contacts (those people with whom you're most likely to chat because you chat or
email with them often) appear in Google Talk.
Change Font. Click this button to open the Font box, where you can change the font and size of the text
in Google Talk. What you select here affects the whole Google Talk interface—not just what you see in the
chat window. If you find yourself squinting at Google Talk, wondering if it's time to get reading glasses,
you can change the font from Google's setting (9-point Arial) to something that's easier on the eyes (like
12-point Verdana).
Account settings. Click this button to open your personal Google Account page ([click here]) in a new
browser window.
Enable diagnostic logging. Diagnostic logging means that info about your use of Google Talk gets sent
to Google so their engineers can analyze it to help people with troubleshooting. Unless you're having a
problem and somebody at Google asks you to turn it on, leave this button alone.
6.1.6.2. Chat
As [click here] explains, you can save your chats in Gmail's Chats mailbox, where you can search them just as
you search email messages ([click here]). The Chat section of the Settings box, shown in Figure 6-10, is where
you turn this feature on or off.
NOTE
If you use Google Talk but don't have a Gmail account, the Settings box doesn't have a Chat section.
Figure 6-10. In the Settings page's Chat section, you've got just two choices: turn chat history on or
off. (It's automatically turned on unless you change that here.) If you have Gmail, you can also turn
off chat history there: Click Settings
Chat, turn on "Don't save chat history in my Gmail account",
and then click Save Changes. Your Google Talk Chat settings update to match your Gmail settings.

Before you decide to turn chat history off, keep these things in mind:
You can receive offline messages (messages others send you through Google Talk when you're not
connected to the Internet; [click here]) only if you have chat history turned on.
Turning off chat history affects only your account—the people you chat with can still save a record of their
chats with you.
To keep certain conversations out of both your chat history and your chat partner's
chat history, take the exchange off the record; [click here] tells you how.
6.1.6.3. Blocked
You can block obnoxious people from contacting you through chat ([click here] tells you how). To view the
names of people you've blocked, go to Settings
Blocked to get to the box shown in Figure 6-11. From here,
you can unblock someone by clicking that person's name on the list, and then clicking Unblock. That person's

name shows up on your Friends list again.
Figure 6-11. If you've blocked people from contacting you via Google Talk ([click here]), their names
and email addresses appear here. To unblock someone, select her name, and then click Unblock.
6.1.6.4. Notifications
Most people do other things while they're chatting online. For example, you might check your email, write a
memo, scan news headlines, listen to your favorite Internet radio station, and keep an eye on an eBay
auction—all while chatting. With all that multitasking going on, it's easy to miss the details of a chat.
Fortunately, you can tell Google Talk how to notify you when something's going on. Select Settings
Notifications to get to the box shown in Figure 6-12.
Figure 6-12. Whether you like a lot of notification ("Hey, you! Pay attention! You've got a message
coming in!") or none at all, you can set your preferences here.

Google Talk offers these options for notifications:
Incoming call. If you use Google Talk to make free voice calls over the Internet ([click here]), Talk can
play a ringtone or pop up a box (or both) to let you know when a call's coming in. If you turn off both
kinds of notification, Google Talk opens the chat window (silently) to let you know when you have an
incoming call.
NOTE
All the notifications on this list (except for Friend Online) are turned on unless you turn them off.
Incoming chat. If you're doing other things—say, writing an email or Googling yourself to see if your
name gets more hits than it did yesterday—and the chat window isn't visible, Google Talk can let you
know when a new message comes in. Your choices are the same as for incoming voice calls—a tone, a
pop-up notification, or both. If you turn off both checkboxes, the Chat window button in the Windows

taskbar and the Google Talk icon (see Figure 6-15) both flash at you when a new message arrives.
Friend online. If you want to know when somebody who's on your Friends list comes online, turn on this
checkbox. A message box pops up when your friend gets online.
New email. High-volume email users, listen up: This option lets you glance at arriving email without
making a trip to your Inbox. When a new email arrives in your Gmail account, a preview window pops
showing the sender, subject, and the beginning of the message. Click the preview to open the email in a
new window. (This option appears in Settings only if you have a Gmail account.)
Disable all notifications. Want to get some work done in peace? If it drives you crazy to have sounds
going off and windows popping up while you're trying to concentrate, turn on this checkbox.
Here's a shortcut to disabling all notifications: Right-click the Google Talk icon in
Windows' lower-right System Tray. From the menu that pops up, select Disable All
Notifications. Repeat the process to turn them back on.
6.1.6.5. Connection
Some organizations that need to keep information secure—like banks, government agencies, and lots of
companies—use things called proxy servers, which create a buffer zone between the organization's computers
and the Internet. This helps protect the organization's computers malicious stuff like viruses and worms.
If your organization uses a proxy server (check with your IT department to find out), you may need to select
Settings
Connection to get to the box shown in Figure 6-13. Here, you can give Google Talk the info it needs
to play nice with the proxy.
Figure 6-13. Here's where you configure Google Talk to work with a proxy server.

Here are your options:
Detect proxy automatically. This is the default setting, which makes your life easier.
Use the following proxy. If your proxy server requires a user name and password to let Internet traffic
through, turn on this radio button and fill in the info in its section (ask an IT person for help with this):
Enter the proxy's host and port, turn on the "Proxy requires Authentication" checkbox, and then type in
the user name and password you use for the proxy. The "Start monitor" button opens the Google Talk
Connection Monitor, which keeps an eye on network traffic. (If you're not a network engineer, you'll never
have to use it.)
6.1.6.6. Audio
If you want to fine-tune the way you send and receive audio during voice calls ([click here]), head to Settings
Audio. The Audio box, shown in Figure 6-14, has these settings:
Input. This section tells Google about the device you speak into during voice calls. Use the drop-down list
to choose a microphone or headset other than the default. If you're not used to speaking into a
microphone, it's easy to speak too loudly or too quietly; leave the checkbox labeled "Automatically adjust
microphone sensitivity" turned on to help you sound your best.
Figure 6-14. These settings let you control how you sound when using Google Talk for voice calls.

You can also start participating in Google Music Trends from here.
Output. This section controls what you hear when using Google Talk. You can specify the device you want
to use to hear notifications or voice calls using the drop-down lists. If you've muted your computer's
speakers (or your headset) to keep the noise down, Talk automatically unmutes them when a call comes
in, to let you know someone's trying to reach you. But if you'd rather the speakers stay quiet when you've
muted them, turn off the "Unmute speaker for ringing" checkbox.
Unmute speaker and microphone when on a call. This setting ensures that you can hear and be heard
when you're on a voice call. If you turn off this checkbox, you might not be able to hear the other person,
and they might not be able to hear you, so it's best to leave it turned on.
Share music listening history with Google Music Trends. If you want to share your musical tastes
with friends, turn on this checkbox (and jump to the box on [click here] to read more about Google Music
Trends).

Chapter 6. Keeping in Touch with Google Talk
Remember when email came along and pretty much killed letter writing? Memo to email: Watch your back.
Instant messaging—often called IM (pronounced "eye-em" by those in the know)—isn't just for kids anymore.
So what is IM and why would you want to use it? Say you have a question for a co-worker and need an answer
now. That's where instant messaging (emphasis on instant) comes in. If you and your colleague are both online,
you can open a chat window, ask your question, and get an answer—all in mere seconds. It's also great for
those long and otherwise tedious email exchanges that go something like: "You free at 2:30 to talk about
Jenkins?" "No. How 'bout 4?" "I can't. Maybe next week?" And so on.
Of course, chatting can be fun, too. When you see a friend or family member online, you can lob a quick hi and
exchange news, even as you work or surf the Web.
Google Talk is Google's foray into the world of instant messaging. If you've used other chat programs, like AOL
Instant Messenger (AIM) or Windows Live Messenger, you'll easily find your way around Google Talk. Even if
you're new to chatting, you'll find Google Talk simple to use. (So far, the full version of Google Talk is for
Windows users only, but Mac and Linux users aren't totally out of luck—see the box on [click here] for details.)
If you use Gmail (Chapter 5), you'll love the way Talk integrates with your Gmail account: sharing contacts,
saving chats, and more. And Talk is about way more than just chatting. You can use it to transfer files, make
free computer-to-computer voice calls, and send and receive voicemail messages. You can even listen to those
voicemail messages right in Gmail.
So what are you waiting for? Read on to become an instant IM pro and add a whole new dimension to
collaborating and staying in touch.
NOTE
You have two ways to chat using Google Talk: the Google Talk client, which you download to your
computer, and the Google Talk gadget, which lives on a Web page, so you can use it from any computer.
The box on [click here] outlines the differences between these two ways of chatting.
6.1. Getting Started with Google Talk
To use Google Talk, you need a Google Account. If you use Gmail, Google Docs, Google Calendar, or any other
Google offering that requires you to sign in, you've already got one. If you don't, Chapter 1 walks you through
the process.
You also need to make sure your computer meets these basic requirements:
Your computer's operating system is Windows 2000, XP, or Vista, or Windows Server 2003.

Your Internet connection must be at least a 56K dial-up connection. But you'll find that Google Talk works
better and faster if you have a broadband connection such as DSL or cable.
NOTE
If you have a Mac or use Linux, the Google Talk client doesn't work on your computer (as of this writing,
anyway—Google says they're working on it). But you can still use the Google Talk gadget. See the box
on [click here] for the details.
Finally, if you plan to use Google Talk to make free voice calls over the Internet ([click here]), you need one of
these:
A microphone and speakers, or
A headset that includes a microphone.
For clarity in both transmitting and receiving, a headset with a noise-canceling
microphone is your best choice. Many headsets connect to your computer via a
USB port. Logitech, Genius, and Panasonic all offer affordable headsets.
Up to Speed: The Two Flavors of Google Talk
Throughout this chapter, you'll see references to the Google Talk client and the Google Talk
gadget. What's the difference?
The Google Talk client is a program that you download to your computer so that you can send and
receive instant messages and over-the-Internet voice calls. You need a recent version of Windows
([click here]) to use Google's talk client.
On the other hand, Google Talk gadget works without having to download and install anything on
your computer. Using a fairly simple procedure (described on [click here]), you embed the Google
Talk gadget (a mini-program-within-a-window) on a Web page, such as iGoogle (Chapter 8) or
your own site. Because the gadget lives online, you can use it no matter what kind of computer
you have: Mac, Linux, Windows, whatever.
Currently, the gadget is a stripped-down version of the Google Talk client: You can chat and, if you
have a Gmail account, get chat histories and messages sent to you when you're not connected to
the Internet. Here's what the gadget can't currently do: transfer files, send messages to others
who aren't connected to the Internet, make voice calls (unless you've got the client running at the

same time), or show music status messages. (This chapter explains how to do all these things with
the client.)
Even so, the Google Talk gadget does a couple of cool things that the client can't do. The biggie is
that you can use the gadget to invite a whole group of friends to the same chat; client chats are
limited to one friend at a time. Also, you can use the gadget to show Google Video or YouTube
videos, or Picasa or Flickr slideshows, right in the chat window.
For more about using the Google Talk gadget, see [click here].
6.1.1. Using Google Talk with Other IM Programs
You can choose from a bunch of different instant messaging networks, and not all of them can talk with each
other. People pick their service based on the one most of their friends use. The great thing about Google Talk is
that it runs on the Jabber service, an open source network that also talks to these (and other) services:
Adium
iChat
Kopete
Miranda
Pidgin
Psi
Trillian Pro
If one of these programs is already your favorite instant-messaging program, you can set it up to connect to
Google Talk. So if you've already got a favorite instant-messaging program, you might prefer to use that one
instead. The steps for setting up your IM program to work with the Google Talk network vary, depending on
your program. For step-by-step instructions, visit www.google.com/talk/otherclients.html, find your IM client in
the table, and then click its name.
Why would you want to connect your IM program to the Google Talk network? Simple. Google Talk shares an
address book with your other Google applications, like Gmail, so you can easily connect with friends and
colleagues.

If you use Gmail, you can chat with your AOL Instant Messenger buddies through
Gmail's version of Google Talk; [click here] tells you how.
Frequently Asked Question: Google Talk and Privacy
Are there any privacy risks associated with using Google Talk?
Google's privacy policy (see the box on [click here]) spells out how it treats your personal
information, and what it does with that info. Here are the main points of the policy as it relates to
chatting:
As you chat, Google may record information about how you're using Talk, including the size of
your Friends list ([click here]), which contacts you communicate with, how often you transfer files,
and how big those files are. In addition, Google keeps track of how you work with Talk: the
settings you choose, the buttons you click, and so on. Finally, if you use chat history ([click here]),
your chats get logged and emailed to your Gmail account. Google doesn't, however, save chat logs
elsewhere.
How does Google use the information it collects? Some of that info is necessary to show your
online presence (whether you're online or not) and status (whether you're available or too busy to
chat right now) to your friends and colleagues. In addition, Google analyzes how you use Talk in
order to improve it. You may be comforted to know that Google says it regularly deletes the
information it collects about Talk users' activity.
You have some control over whether Google saves the contents of your chats. You can turn off
chat history by going to Settings
Chat, and then turning on the "Don't save chat history in my
Gmail account" radio button. Or, in your Gmail account, choose Settings
Chat, turn on the
"Don't save chat history in my Gmail account" radio button, and then click Save Changes. Even if
you tell Google not to save your chats, though, your chat partners can still save chats in which you
participate. To really make sure that nobody logs a chat, take it off the record ([click here]).
If you use chat history, Gmail scans incoming chats for keywords just as it does other email, so it
can display ads related to the content of your chats. (The box on [click here] explains about
targeted ads in Gmail.)
6.1.2. Downloading Google Talk
To download Google Talk and start chatting, head over to www.google.com/talk (see Figure 6-1). Click the big
blue Download Google Talk button.
Figure 6-1. You can't miss the big Download Google Talk button. Click it to start the download and
installation process, which takes less than a minute if you've got a high-speed Internet connection.

A thank-you page opens. (If your download doesn't begin automatically, click the "Click here" link to start the
download.) Your browser opens a box to ask how you want to handle the download. If you're using Internet
Explorer, click Run; in Firefox, click Save File. In Internet Explorer, the Google Talk installation starts
automatically. In Firefox, double-click the installation file on your Desktop, and then agree to Google's terms of
service (see [click here]) to start the installation. It's quick—in fact, if you blink you might miss it. Click Finish at
the end of the Installation Wizard, and Google Talk opens, ready for you sign in—head to [click here] to learn
how.
6.1.2.1. Download Google Talk to your Blackberry
If your BlackBerry is as necessary to you as oxygen, you're gonna love this. You can download Google Talk to
your BlackBerry and use it to chat while you do all those things that make your BlackBerry so indispensable:
check your email, listen to music, navigate a route, play a round of Frogger, whatever.
To get Google Talk onto your BlackBerry, download it at www.blackberry.com/googletalk. After you've installed
Google Talk, sign into your Google Account. Now you can access and add to your Google Talk contact list, see
who's online, and send and get instant messages. And your BlackBerry home screen lets you know when you've
got a new message. Pretty cool, huh?
6.1.3. Signing In
The Google Talk sign-in window, shown in Figure 6-2, is where you sign into launch Google Talk. Here's a quick
tour:
Username. If you have a Gmail account, this is the part of your address that comes before @gmail.com.
If you don't have Gmail, the user name is the nickname you provided when you created your Google Talk

account.
Password. Type your Google Account password here.
Remember password. Turn on this checkbox if you're the only one who uses this computer and you
don't want the hassle of entering your password every time you sign in. But if security is a concern, or if
you're using Google Talk on a shared computer, turn this checkbox off.
Once you've entered your user name and password, click the big Sign In button to open Google Talk.
Figure 6-2. Use your Google Account or Gmail login info to sign into Google Talk.

If you're having trouble signing in to Google Talk, the problem may be with your
firewall, the security filter that protects your computer from bad stuff on the Internet.
Google offers step-by-step help for getting your firewall to play nice with Google Talk, if
you use McAfee Personal Firewall, Norton Personal Firewall, PC-Cillin Internet Security,
Tiny Personal Firewall, or ZoneAlarm. To find out how to adjust your firewall's settings,
go to www.google.com/support/talk to get to Talk's Help page. In the Troubleshooting
section, click "Setting Up and Signing In"
"I have a firewall and can't connect to
Google Talk. Help!" From there, find your firewall, and then click its name to get specific
instructions.
6.1.4. Sending a Message
Figure 6-3 shows what you see when you sign into Google Talk: your Friends list—a roster of friends,
colleagues, and family members with whom you might want to chat. You can chat only with people who appear
on this list ([click here] tells you how to add your friends). If you use Gmail, Google Talk automatically shows
your Gmail contacts here. Contacts you've chatted with in the past (when collaborating in Google Docs, for
example) also appear as chat partners. For these people, you can see a picture (if they've chosen one) and their
status: Available, Idle, Busy, or Offline. Other contacts appear on the list, too, but you have to invite them to
use Google Talk ([click here]) before you can chat with them.
Figure 6-3. Your Google Talk Friends list shows you the status of your friends and contacts.

If you see the word "Available" below someone's name, that's tantamount to her declaring: "Hey everyone, I'm
ready to chat." Put your cursor over the person's name, and a new window with her contact info flies out, as
shown in Figure 6-4. Google calls this a profile card. In the profile card, click the Chat button to open a chat
window like the one in Figure 6-5.
Figure 6-4. When you put your cursor over someone's name, you see that person's profile card (her
email address is at the bottom of the box). Click the email address to open your email program and
send an email, or click Chat (circled), Call, or Send Files (which appears only if your friend is online
now).

To launch a chat even faster, just click a person's name in your Friends list, and Google
opens a chat window.
Figure 6-5. Google Talk's chat window is a cinch to use: Type in a message at the bottom, hit Enter,
and your message appears in the chat area.

In the chat window, type your message in the narrow text box at the bottom, and then hit Enter. Your message
appears in the chat area, above where you typed. At the same time, the message appears on your friend's
monitor in a chat window. When your friend answers, her message appears in your chat window and (depending
on your settings [[click here]]) a tone alerts you that you've got a message. And so it goes, back and forth, for
as long as you continue to chat.
6.1.5. Personalizing Google Talk
Chatting is pretty basic—you and a friend exchange witty messages back and forth. But "basic" doesn't
necessarily mean "boring." You can add flavor to Google Talk by personalizing it: add a photo, a funny (or
informative) status message, or a different theme to the chat display. You may be surprised at the ways you
can spiff up your Talk account.
6.1.5.1. Set your status
When you've installed Google Talk and signed in, Talk automatically sets your status to Available, meaning
people on your Friends list can see that you're online and ready to chat. You can tell if someone's available
because Talk displays a green-for-go circle and the word Available by his name, as Figure 6-6 shows. You can
also set your status to Busy, letting online friends know that now isn't a good time to chat, or create a custom
message.
Figure 6-6. Your current chat status (circled) shows up just below your name. To change your status,
click the down arrow and choose from the drop-down list. When you create a custom status
message, that message appears on the list the next time you click the drop arrow—it's equivalent to
hanging a note on your office door: On the Phone, In a Meeting, Hiding Under My Desk—whatever
you want to say.

To set your status, click the down arrow next to your current status at the top of your Friends list. This opens
the drop-down list shown in Figure 6-6. Select a status from the list, and it appears in the main Talk
window—and also on all your contacts' Friends lists.
The built-in status choices are pretty basic: Available, Busy, or showing whatever music you're currently
listening to. (See the box on [click here] for more about Google Music Trends.) You can write a custom message
that tells your friends and colleagues what you're actually doing right now, like On a conference call or Back at
3:30 or Moved to Rio to escape the snow. By giving a bit more info than Busy or Available, a custom message
gives other chatters a reason to contact you or leave you alone.
NOTE
If you're away from your computer for 5 minutes or so, your status changes to Idle, represented by an

orange clock icon. This icon lets your contacts know that you're not at your computer and may not
answer a chat message or voice call. When you get back to your computer, your Idle status changes
back to the most recent status you chose.
To create a custom message, click the down arrow next to your current status, and then, from the drop-down
list, choose one of the "Custom message" items. If you want to create an Available message (showing the green
Available icon), then pick the first item; if you want to create a Busy message (showing the red Busy icon, which
looks like a "Do not enter" traffic sign), then pick the second. When you make your selection, your current
status changes to a text box. Type in your message, and then hit Enter. Your current status changes, for you
and all your contacts to see.
Talk automatically creates two versions of your custom message (one for Busy and one for Available), which
both appear in the status drop-down list. So if you want to keep your custom message but switch from Available
to Busy (or vice versa), just click the down arrow and make your selection.
If you create a lot of custom messages, the status drop-down list can get pretty long. To clear custom
messages, select "Clear custom messages". (This option appears in the status menu only when you've created
at least one custom message.) When you do, Talk deletes all your custom messages.
When you set your status to Busy, your contacts can still initiate a chat. (Some people
can't take a hint, or haven't yet read this chapter.) So if you're really busy and don't
want to be distracted, pull Talk's plug by signing out. When you do so, your status
changes to Offline in your contacts' Friends lists. They can send you a voicemail ([click
here]) or offline message ([click here]), but can't try to chat with you.
Frequently Asked Question: Google Music Trends
There's an option on the Google Talk status menu called "Show current music track". What's that
about?
Lots of people listen to music on their computers as they work, chat, and surf. You can share your
musical tastes with the world by clicking the down arrow next to your current status, and then,
from your status list, selecting one of the "Show current music track" items. Talk displays the
green or red status icon, depending on which item you chose, to show whether you're busy or
ready for a chat. But instead of the usual Available or Busy status message, it shows whatever
music you're playing on your computer right now.
Music players that work with this feature include iTunes, Windows Media Player, Winamp, and the
Yahoo Music Engine. When you're not listening to music, Talk shows your status as Available or
Busy, depending on which "Show current music track" item you chose.
If you want, you can also participate in Google Music Trends, a project of Google Labs. Google
Music Trends collects (and makes anonymous) info about the music Google Talk users are listening
to, and displays the results at www.google.com/trends/music. Google Music Trends shows the
most popular tracks by genre, and you can click a song to learn more about it through Google
Music Search. So every time you play a song, it's like you're casting a vote for it.

To tell Google Music Trends about your musical tastes, click Settings
Audio, and then turn on
the checkbox labeled "Share music listening history with Google Music Trends". You can come back
to the Settings box and turn off this checkbox at any time to stop sharing.
6.1.5.2. Add a photo or picture
If you're a Gmail fan and you've added a photo to your Gmail account ([click here]), then you'll find that when
you install Google Talk, your Gmail photo appears as an thumbnail-sized picture of you for Google Talk.
Depending on your settings (explained in the next section), that picture appears next to each comment you
make during a chat. If you don't add a photo or other image, your picture is a unisex silhouette—kind of boring,
unless your online persona is The Shadow.
You can change your Google Talk avatar as often (or as seldom) as you like—from the formal portrait on your
business card to a vacation snapshot to a goofy cartoon character. To upload an image to use as your picture,
follow these steps:
Hover your cursor over your current picture at the top of the main Talk window.
A down arrow appears at the bottom of the image.
1.
Click the down arrow.
Talk displays a bunch of cartoon images and any pictures you've uploaded and used in the past. Figure 6-
7 shows an example.
2.
Figure 6-7. If you've ever wanted to be a frog or a monkey, select one of Google Talk's built-in
cartoons as your picture. Otherwise, click "More pictures" at the bottom of the box to upload your
own image.

Click "More pictures" at the bottom of the selection menu.
A box opens that lets you browse for files on your computer.
0.
Find and select the image you want to upload (it can be a .jpg, .gif, .bmp, or .png file), and then click
Open.
Talk automatically resizes your image to the right dimensions, and makes it your picture.
1.
After you've uploaded an image, it's added to the list of pictures you can choose from. So if you want to switch
from today's picture to the one you used last week, just put your cursor over your current picture, click the
down arrow that appears, and then, from the menu that appears, choose the picture you want.

If you have a Gmail account, the picture you choose for Talk also appears in Gmail.
(When your name appears on somebody's Gmail Contacts list, your picture appears with
it.) If you want a avatar in Talk but not in Gmail, open Gmail, and then click Settings. In
the "My picture" section of the General tab, turn on the "Visible only to people I can chat
with" radio button. This makes it so your picture appears only in chat sessions, not
people's Contacts lists.
6.1.5.3. Choose a theme
When you start using Google Talk, the chat window is preset to a style called Classic Picture (turn back to
Figure 6-5 to see what it looks like). This theme shows the pictures you and your chat partners use to the left of
what each person types. Text appears on a plain white background.
Talk gives you several themes to choose from. To check 'em out and pick a new theme, go to the main Talk
window (the one that shows your Friends list), and then click Settings
Appearance. In the box that opens,
click the Chat Theme drop-down list to see the various styles (Figure 6-8). Most themes have two
versions—with pictures or without. Pick a theme to see a preview of it below the drop-down menu.
Figure 6-8. Here's the current list of themes from which Google Talk lets you choose. Pick one to see
a preview of it.

6.1.6. Google Talk's Preferences
You can start chatting away within seconds of downloading Google Talk. Or, you can take a few seconds longer
and change the Google Talk settings that control things like message notifications, and whether to show or hide
friends who aren't online right now. To do that, at the top of the main Google Talk window (the one that shows
your contacts), click the Settings link, and then tweak away (Figure 6-9).
Figure 6-9. Talk's General Settings page lets you set preferences about starting up, responding to
email links, what your Friends list looks like, and the font Google Talk uses.

6.1.6.1. General
Here's where you adjust these miscellaneous settings:
Start automatically when starting Windows. If you don't want to miss a second of chat time, leave
this checkbox turned on, and Google Talk opens as soon as you start Windows. If you turn off this
checkbox, you have to start Google Talk yourself ([click here]) when you're ready to chat.
If you really want to get chatting right away, turn on the "Remember password"
checkbox when you sign in. When Google Talk starts up, you're signed in and ready
to go.
Open Gmail when I click on email links. Turning on this checkbox makes Gmail open automatically
when you click someone's email address in your Friends list.
Sort by name. Turn on this checkbox if you want the names in your Friends list to be in alphabetical
order.

Hide offline friends. To see only those friends who are currently online, turn on this checkbox.
Hide Google address book contacts not on my Google Talk friends list. If you use Gmail, Google
takes your Contacts from your address book and adds them to your Google Talk Friends list. But some of
those contacts you won't ever chat with, like subscriptions@myfavoritemagazine.com or
info@localstore.com. To see only the people you've agreed to chat with, turn on this checkbox.
Add people I communicate with often to my Friends list. This checkbox is automatically turned on to
make sure your top contacts (those people with whom you're most likely to chat because you chat or
email with them often) appear in Google Talk.
Change Font. Click this button to open the Font box, where you can change the font and size of the text
in Google Talk. What you select here affects the whole Google Talk interface—not just what you see in the
chat window. If you find yourself squinting at Google Talk, wondering if it's time to get reading glasses,
you can change the font from Google's setting (9-point Arial) to something that's easier on the eyes (like
12-point Verdana).
Account settings. Click this button to open your personal Google Account page ([click here]) in a new
browser window.
Enable diagnostic logging. Diagnostic logging means that info about your use of Google Talk gets sent
to Google so their engineers can analyze it to help people with troubleshooting. Unless you're having a
problem and somebody at Google asks you to turn it on, leave this button alone.
6.1.6.2. Chat
As [click here] explains, you can save your chats in Gmail's Chats mailbox, where you can search them just as
you search email messages ([click here]). The Chat section of the Settings box, shown in Figure 6-10, is where
you turn this feature on or off.
NOTE
If you use Google Talk but don't have a Gmail account, the Settings box doesn't have a Chat section.
Figure 6-10. In the Settings page's Chat section, you've got just two choices: turn chat history on or
off. (It's automatically turned on unless you change that here.) If you have Gmail, you can also turn
off chat history there: Click Settings
Chat, turn on "Don't save chat history in my Gmail account",
and then click Save Changes. Your Google Talk Chat settings update to match your Gmail settings.

Before you decide to turn chat history off, keep these things in mind:
You can receive offline messages (messages others send you through Google Talk when you're not
connected to the Internet; [click here]) only if you have chat history turned on.
Turning off chat history affects only your account—the people you chat with can still save a record of their
chats with you.
To keep certain conversations out of both your chat history and your chat partner's
chat history, take the exchange off the record; [click here] tells you how.
6.1.6.3. Blocked
You can block obnoxious people from contacting you through chat ([click here] tells you how). To view the
names of people you've blocked, go to Settings
Blocked to get to the box shown in Figure 6-11. From here,
you can unblock someone by clicking that person's name on the list, and then clicking Unblock. That person's

name shows up on your Friends list again.
Figure 6-11. If you've blocked people from contacting you via Google Talk ([click here]), their names
and email addresses appear here. To unblock someone, select her name, and then click Unblock.
6.1.6.4. Notifications
Most people do other things while they're chatting online. For example, you might check your email, write a
memo, scan news headlines, listen to your favorite Internet radio station, and keep an eye on an eBay
auction—all while chatting. With all that multitasking going on, it's easy to miss the details of a chat.
Fortunately, you can tell Google Talk how to notify you when something's going on. Select Settings
Notifications to get to the box shown in Figure 6-12.
Figure 6-12. Whether you like a lot of notification ("Hey, you! Pay attention! You've got a message
coming in!") or none at all, you can set your preferences here.

Google Talk offers these options for notifications:
Incoming call. If you use Google Talk to make free voice calls over the Internet ([click here]), Talk can
play a ringtone or pop up a box (or both) to let you know when a call's coming in. If you turn off both
kinds of notification, Google Talk opens the chat window (silently) to let you know when you have an
incoming call.
NOTE
All the notifications on this list (except for Friend Online) are turned on unless you turn them off.
Incoming chat. If you're doing other things—say, writing an email or Googling yourself to see if your
name gets more hits than it did yesterday—and the chat window isn't visible, Google Talk can let you
know when a new message comes in. Your choices are the same as for incoming voice calls—a tone, a
pop-up notification, or both. If you turn off both checkboxes, the Chat window button in the Windows

taskbar and the Google Talk icon (see Figure 6-15) both flash at you when a new message arrives.
Friend online. If you want to know when somebody who's on your Friends list comes online, turn on this
checkbox. A message box pops up when your friend gets online.
New email. High-volume email users, listen up: This option lets you glance at arriving email without
making a trip to your Inbox. When a new email arrives in your Gmail account, a preview window pops
showing the sender, subject, and the beginning of the message. Click the preview to open the email in a
new window. (This option appears in Settings only if you have a Gmail account.)
Disable all notifications. Want to get some work done in peace? If it drives you crazy to have sounds
going off and windows popping up while you're trying to concentrate, turn on this checkbox.
Here's a shortcut to disabling all notifications: Right-click the Google Talk icon in
Windows' lower-right System Tray. From the menu that pops up, select Disable All
Notifications. Repeat the process to turn them back on.
6.1.6.5. Connection
Some organizations that need to keep information secure—like banks, government agencies, and lots of
companies—use things called proxy servers, which create a buffer zone between the organization's computers
and the Internet. This helps protect the organization's computers malicious stuff like viruses and worms.
If your organization uses a proxy server (check with your IT department to find out), you may need to select
Settings
Connection to get to the box shown in Figure 6-13. Here, you can give Google Talk the info it needs
to play nice with the proxy.
Figure 6-13. Here's where you configure Google Talk to work with a proxy server.

Here are your options:
Detect proxy automatically. This is the default setting, which makes your life easier.
Use the following proxy. If your proxy server requires a user name and password to let Internet traffic
through, turn on this radio button and fill in the info in its section (ask an IT person for help with this):
Enter the proxy's host and port, turn on the "Proxy requires Authentication" checkbox, and then type in
the user name and password you use for the proxy. The "Start monitor" button opens the Google Talk
Connection Monitor, which keeps an eye on network traffic. (If you're not a network engineer, you'll never
have to use it.)
6.1.6.6. Audio
If you want to fine-tune the way you send and receive audio during voice calls ([click here]), head to Settings
Audio. The Audio box, shown in Figure 6-14, has these settings:
Input. This section tells Google about the device you speak into during voice calls. Use the drop-down list
to choose a microphone or headset other than the default. If you're not used to speaking into a
microphone, it's easy to speak too loudly or too quietly; leave the checkbox labeled "Automatically adjust
microphone sensitivity" turned on to help you sound your best.
Figure 6-14. These settings let you control how you sound when using Google Talk for voice calls.

You can also start participating in Google Music Trends from here.
Output. This section controls what you hear when using Google Talk. You can specify the device you want
to use to hear notifications or voice calls using the drop-down lists. If you've muted your computer's
speakers (or your headset) to keep the noise down, Talk automatically unmutes them when a call comes
in, to let you know someone's trying to reach you. But if you'd rather the speakers stay quiet when you've
muted them, turn off the "Unmute speaker for ringing" checkbox.
Unmute speaker and microphone when on a call. This setting ensures that you can hear and be heard
when you're on a voice call. If you turn off this checkbox, you might not be able to hear the other person,
and they might not be able to hear you, so it's best to leave it turned on.
Share music listening history with Google Music Trends. If you want to share your musical tastes
with friends, turn on this checkbox (and jump to the box on [click here] to read more about Google Music
Trends).
6.1.6.7. Appearance

As explained on [click here], the Appearance section of the Settings box (Settings
Appearance), shown in
Figure 6-8, is where you can choose a different theme for your chat window.
 

 
6.2. Launching Google Talk Manually
When you first install Google Talk, it starts automatically whenever you turn on your computer, but you can
change that setting ([click here]). If you tell Google Talk not to start automatically, though, you need to know
how to start it up yourself. You've got two options:
From the Windows Start menu. Click Start
Programs
Google Talk
Google Talk.
From the Windows System Tray. In your computer's screen's lower-right, where the current time
shows, is the Windows System Tray. The tray holds icons you can click for quick access to programs and
preference settings. Click the Google Talk icon, shown in Figure 6-15, to launch the program.
NOTE
You don't see the Google Talk icon in the System Tray if you chose not to start up Talk
automatically when Windows starts.
Figure 6-15. If Google Talk doesn't open automatically when you start your computer, click the
Google Talk icon to sign in and start chatting.
 

 
6.3. Working with Your Friends List
Your Friends list (Figure 6-3) is where you add and manage the names of everyone you might want to chat with.
You can do a lot here: Invite people to chat, find a particular pal's name (helpful if you've got a long list), block
someone from contacting you, and more.
6.3.1. Add a Friend to Your List
Before you can chat with someone for the first time, both of you have to agree to be chat partners. You do this
by inviting a friend to chat, or accepting an invitation from them. If you've never chatted with someone before
and you'd like to invite them to join you in Google Talk, here's what you do:
Click the Add button below your Friends list.
Google Talk opens the "Invite your friends" box shown in Figure 6-16.
Figure 6-16. To invite others to chat with you, click the Add button (circled), and then
tell Google where to send the invitation(s).
1.

Type your buddy's email address in the text box (if you're inviting more than one person, put commas
between their email addresses).
You can also choose contacts from your Google address book instead of typing them in. When you've
entered email addresses for everyone you want to invite, click Next. On the page that appears, you can
customize the invitation, if you want.
2.
Once you're done with any customizing, click Next, and then click Finish to send the invitation(s).
If your buddy already has Gmail or Google Talk, Google sends him an invitation so you can add each other
to your Friends lists. If your buddy doesn't use Gmail or Google Talk, Google invites him to download
Google Talk. (If you've invited a bunch of people, Google figures out which kind of invitation to send to
each person.)
0.
After you've invited someone, Google marks that person's name as invited on your Friend's list. When he
accepts your invitation, he becomes active on your Friends list (meaning you can see his status icon [[click
here]] and status message); just click his name to start chatting.

6.3.2. Accept a Friend's Invitation
When someone sends you a Google Talk chat invitation, their request appears in your Friends list. Google tells
you who's invited you and supplies yes and no buttons so you can accept or decline. Click "yes" to add the
person to your Friends list and be added to hers. Now you can click that person's name to start a chat.
6.3.3. View a Friend's Current Status
You don't want to bug your friends and colleagues by requesting a chat when they're busy. And you don't want
to sit around waiting for a reply from someone who's just turned off her computer. Knowing what each friend is
up to keeps you from wasting your time or annoying somebody who doesn't feel like chatting right now.
You can see everyone's status at a glance on the left side of your Friends list, next to each person's name. Table
6-1 lists each status icon and what it means.
Table 6-1. Google Talk Status Icons
Icon
What It Means
Green dot
Your friend is online and willing to chat.
Red "Do not enter" sign
Your friend is online but doesn't want to chat right now.
Orange clock
Your friend is away from her computer.
Speech bubble
You're currently chatting with this friend.
Speech bubble with lines inside
Your friend has sent you a message.
Gray circle with an X inside
Your friend isn't connected to the Internet (or is signed out of Google Talk).
Besides the status icon, each friend's status message appears in light gray letters just below his name. If your
friend has written a custom status message ([click here]), it may give you more info about what he's doing.
6.3.4. Find a Friend
As your Friends list grows, it might take some hunting to zero in on a particular friend. Don't forget,
though—this is Google. They're great at helping your find what you're looking for.
To find a particular friend on your Friends list, use the Search box at the top of the list. Start typing in the first
few letters of your friend's name. Talk shows you friends whose names match the letters you've typed. Click a
name to select that person and strike up a conversation (if she uses talk already) or send her an invitation (if
she doesn't).
6.3.5. Sort Your Friends List
Google automatically arranges your Friends list to put those who you've most recently chatted with at the top.
You can't do much to change that order—you can't, for example, sort friends into folders. But you can sort your
Friends list in a few other ways. At the bottom of the Friends list, click the View button to choose from the
display options shown in Figure 6-17:

Show one page. When you've got a long list of contacts, you can display just the first page of your most
frequent contacts. If you turn off this option, Google adds a scroll bar to your Friends list that lets you
scroll down to see beyond that first page.
Sort by name. When you turn this option on, Talk shows friends' names in alphabetical order.
Show pictures. If you want to save space by not showing your buddies' pictures in your Friends list, turn
this option off.
Show offline friends. You can send messages to friends who aren't logged into Google Talk ([click here]
tells you how), but if you want to focus on just the folks who are online, then turn this option off.
Show all address book contacts. When this option's turned on, your Friends list shows all your
contacts, even those with whom you haven't agreed to chat. Turn it off if you want the list to show only
active friends and those you've invited.
You can sort your Friends list using just one of these ways, or combine several options to sort it just the way
you want.
Figure 6-17. You can reconfigure your Friends list in a couple of clicks using the View menu.

6.3.6. Send an Email
You can start an email right from your Friends list. This property can be handy if you have Talk open but not

Gmail. Just hover your cursor over the a person's name to see his profile card ([click here]). To send an email,
click the email address at the bottom of the profile card to open your preferred email program. If you use Gmail
and want to compose an email, you can also click the profile card's upper-right down arrow and select Email.
6.3.7. Block Someone from Chatting with You
As anyone who's spent time online knows, the Internet is rife with jerks, bozos, and that annoying friend of your
parents who just got his first computer. Sooner or later, one of them will probably want to chat with you. When
you get an invitation to chat with someone you either don't like or don't know, you can just say no to the
invitation ([click here]).
If someone's already on your Friends list, though, and you decide you don't want to talk to that person
anymore, you can block her from chatting with you. When you block someone, neither of you can chat with the
other. In addition, you don't see each other's online status. To someone you've blocked, you always appear to
be offline. It's like you're invisible to each other (while you're online, anyway—if you run into the person on the
street, you're on your own).
To block someone in Google Talk, find the person on your Friends list and right-click his name. From the menu
that appears, select Block. In the Block Friend confirmation box, click OK. Talk removes the person from your
Friends list and moves him to the Blocked list (go to Settings
Blocked to see it). Now you can surf the Web in
peace.
When you've blocked someone, you don't receive any offline messages ([click here]) that person tries to send
you. However, people on your Blocked list can still use Google Talk to send you email.
If someone gets obnoxious during a chat, and you want to block that person right then
and there, in the upper-right corner of the chat window, click the down arrow. Its menu
gives you the option to block your chat partner immediately.
Blocking isn't necessarily forever. To restore a blocked contact to your Friends list, go to Settings
Blocked.
Click the name of the person you want to restore, and then click the Unblock button. That person jumps from
the Blocked list back to your Friends list.
6.3.8. Remove Someone from the List
Occasionally, you may want to remove a name or two from your Friends list. You might do this if your list
includes a colleague who's moved on to a new job or a Gmail contact you know you'll never chat with (like the
address you use to email attachments into Google Docs [[click here]]—it's not a person, after all).
To remove someone from your Friends list, right-click the name you want to nix. From the menu that pops up,
select Remove. A confirmation box appears. Click OK, and the contact's gone.
 

 
6.4. Sending and Receiving Messages
As far as the basics go, sending and receiving messages couldn't be much easier: Click a name in your Friends
list, type in a message, hit Enter, and then wait for your friend to respond. (Heck, you don't even have to wait
for the response. You can do something else, and Talk lets you know when the message arrives.) This section
helps you go beyond those basics, so you can optimize your Google Talk experience.
6.4.1. Save Your Chats
Google saves your chats and delivers them to your Gmail account—as long as you have a Gmail account and
haven't told Google not to save your chats (which you can do by going to Settings
Chat; see [click here]).
This feature is called chat history, and it can be useful if you need to remember something that somebody said
during an online discussion. For example, your cousin might mention the dates she's considering for her
upcoming wedding, or a business associate might make a comment you want to refer back to later.
To see your chats, go to your Gmail account, and then click Chats on the left-hand side of the page. Your chats
are all there; click one to open it and read it again. You can also search chats, just as you search your email
messages ([click here]).
When you're chatting with someone, you can go straight to your Gmail Chats mailbox to
see previous chats you've had with this person. In the chat window, click the upper-right
down arrow, and then select "View past chats". Gmail searches your chats folder for the
person you're chatting with, and opens a new window with the results.
6.4.2. Go Off the Record
Politicians and celebrities say things off the record all the time. Even if you're not hounded by the paparazzi,
there may be times when you don't want your life (or your chat, anyway) to be an open book. Taking a chat off
the record means the chat won't be saved—not in your Gmail Chats folder, and not in the other person's Gmail
Chats folder, either. You and your partner can still chat, but no history of the talk will be preserved.
Just follow these steps:
In the chat window, click the upper-right down arrow.
A drop-down menu appears, as shown in Figure 6-18.
1.
Select "Go off the record".
Google quits recording the chat. A message appears in the chat window for both you and your friend
reminding you of this fact.
2.
Figure 6-18. To keep a chat from being saved and archived, head to this drop-down menu, and then

make the selection shown here. You can go back on the record at any time by coming back to this
menu and selecting "Stop chatting off the record".
Either person who's chatting can tell Google to turn chat history back on. The "off the record" message that
appears in both your chat windows has a Cancel link, which either of you can click. (You can also click the
upper-right down arrow again, and then select "Stop chatting off the record").
Google notifies both participants when someone flips the record switch either off or on. So you don't have to
worry that someone is secretly using Google to preserve your comments. (Of course, even if you're off the
record, your friend could always copy the chat window's contents and save it in a Word document, for example,
so beware.)
6.4.3. Collapse the Chat Window
If you're chatting in a high-traffic environment, like an office with nosy coworkers, a crowded coffee shop, or
even the family room at home, it can feel like the whole world is looking over your shoulder. To increase your
sense of privacy, minimize the Google Talk chat window, so nobody can peek at your conversation between
messages. Just click the gray bar along the top of the chat window, where your chat partner's name appears,
and the bar swallows up the rest of the chat window.

Even with the chat window minimized, you don't miss a thing. When a new message arrives, you get whatever
notifications you signed up for ([click here]). In addition, the Google Talk icon and the status icon next to your
friend's name (in the scrunched up chat window) flash until you expand the window. To expand it, just click the
gray bar again.
6.4.4. Make Text Bold or Italic
In chat, one way to emphasize a point is to use ALL CAPS. BUT BECAUSE THIS LOOKS LIKE SHOUTING, many
people find it off-putting, and even rude. You can get your point across in a more subtle, sophisticated way by
making certain words or phrases bold or italic:
To make a word or phrase bold, put an asterisk (*) before and after the text you want boldfaced, like this:
*This text is bold*.
To make a word or phrase italic, surround the word or phrase with underscores, like this: _This text is
italic_.
When you hit Enter, the text appears in the chat window with the formatting you chose.
6.4.5. Send and Receive Offline Messages
To chat, you and your friend both have to be online and signed in to Google Talk, of course. But even if your
friend is offline, you can send a quick message through Google Talk. An offline message is a chat message you
can send to someone who's not connected to the Internet. Instead of zipping right over to the other person's
chat window, an offline message gets stored in Talk, so it's ready and waiting the next time your friend comes
online and fires up Talk. Offline messages aren't a replacement for email—you don't want to use offline
messages to communicate with your business contacts—but they're handy if you want to tell a friend, "Hey, let
me know when you sign on. I've got big news!"
Sending an offline messages is easy: Find and click the person's name in your Friends list. When the chat
window opens, it shows a message telling you your friend is offline. Type your message into the chat window's
text box anyway, and then hit Enter.
When your friend gets back online and opens Google Talk, the chat window appears automatically, showing the
message you sent, along with the date and time you sent it. In addition, your message appears in your friend's
Gmail Chats folder.
NOTE
You can receive offline messages only if chat history is turned on for your Google Talk account. To see
whether chat history is on, go to Settings
Chats. You need to have a Gmail address to receive offline
messages.
6.4.6. Manage Multiple Chat Windows

Modern-day communications won't wait—people expect an answer and they expect it 30 seconds ago. So busy
people sometimes have to carry on several conversations at once: take a phone call on their headsets while
reading an email, answering an IM, and making lunch plans with colleagues who stop by their cubicles. If that
sounds familiar, you'll be happy to know you can have several chats going at once in Google Talk.
If you're already chatting with someone when you start a new chat, Talk stacks the chat windows, as shown in
Figure 6-19. Google stacks the windows, with the chat that started first at the top of the pile. The chat you're
currently viewing shows the full chat window; any others appear as bars with your friends' name and current
status: typing, available, offline, and so on. To switch from one chat to another, click the bar of the chat you
want to switch to, and the chat window for that conversation opens.
Figure 6-19. When you have several chats going simultaneously, Talk stacks the chat windows. Click
a minimized chat to expand it, or drag a minimized chat (starting at the bottom of the stack) to take
it out of the stack and open it in another part of your screen.
You can also use the Tab key to move between chat windows. Hit Enter to expand a
minimized conversation.
It's easy to mix up the different chats. You don't want to type Don't forget to do your homework. Love you! to

your kid, only to find that you sent it to a client instead—oops. If you find stacked chat windows a little hard to
manage, you can separate them. Starting with the bottom chat in the stack, you can drag to move the chat
window out of the stack and open it elsewhere on the screen. You can also restack the windows and change
their order by dragging them to the position you prefer.
Gem in the Rough: Translating Chats with Google Bots
In geek speak, a bot is a program that runs 24/7, sifting through data and automating tasks.
Google has created a number of translation bots you can use with Google Talk. When you chat
with a bot, you type in a word or phrase, and the bot translates it from the language you typed
into the language you specified. (Your kids probably already do their Spanish homework this way.)
To use a translation bot, you first have to invite ([click here]) the bot to get it on your Friends list.
For example, say you want to brush up on your Italian. First, add the English-to-Italian translation
bot to your Friends list by clicking Add, and then entering en2it@bot.talk.google.com as the email
address you're inviting. The bot accepts your invitation almost immediately. Once you have the
bot on your Friends list, you can chat with it just like you would with a real, live person: Click its
name, and then start typing in the chat window. If you type Hi, how are you?, the bot responds
with Ciao, come stai? And so on.
If you're chatting with someone who speaks a different language, you can set up a group chat
([click here]) using the Google Talk gadget or Gmail chat, and then invite two translation bots to
the conversation. For example, if you're chatting with someone in Paris and his English isn't much
better than your French, invite both the English-to-French bot (called en2fr) and the French-to-
English bot (called fr2en) to your chat. When you type something in English, en2fr translates it
into French, and when your chat partner answers in French, fr2en translates his comments into
English.
The table below shows the language bots currently available in Google Talk (you can translate
from any of the listed languages into English, but you can't currently translate English into quite all
the other languages). To add one to your chat, invite it, using the email address [language
abbreviation]2[language abbreviation]@bot.talk.google.com. So if you want to translate from
English to Japanese, for example, you'd invite en2ja@bot.talk.google.com.

Bots can also translate from French to German (fr2de) and from German to French (de2fr).
Like any automated translator, Google's bots aren't perfect. If the bot doesn't recognize a word, it
inserts the word, as is, into its translation. And, due to the nature of language, you'll occasionally
get a real howler of a translation. Even so, translation bots can be a big help when your chats go
international.
 

 
6.5. Transferring Files
Imagine you're talking to a colleague and you ask for the notes she took at yesterday's meeting. She promises
to email them, and then you wait...and wait...and wait for her to remember to send you the file. If you're
chatting in Google Talk, she can send you the file as soon as the subject comes up, without having to trudge
over to her email program. Or if you're chatting with a cousin who couldn't make it to your parents' 50th
wedding anniversary, you can send photos via Talk, so they're visible right in the chat window. And if he wants,
your cousin can download the photos as a keepsake.
Before you start sending and receiving files through Google Talk, keep these things in mind:
You can transfer files only during an active chat—you can't transfer files to someone who's offline.
There are no size limitations on the files your can transfer using Google Talk. If you're transferring a big
file, Talk shows a status bar to let you know how the transfer's proceeding. (You can keep chatting as the
file transfers.) This feature's a huge deal, especially for folks with email providers who impose attachment
size limits.
6.5.1. Send a File
The easiest way to transfer a file is to simply drop the file into the chat window—you can even transfer a whole
folder this way. So if you've got a file saved on your desktop, just drag it into the chat window and Talk starts
transferring it. Alternatively, you can follow these steps, which are almost as quick:
At the top of your active chat window, you see a Send Files button; click that.
A window opens that lets you find the file you want on your computer.
1.
Browse to the file you want to send. Select it, and then click Open.
Google sends the file to the chat window.
2.
When you share a file in a chat, two things happen:
In your talk window, Talk notifies you that you've shared a file, giving its size, type, and name. It also
displays a Cancel link that lets you take back the file, withdrawing your offer to share it.
Talk notifies your friend that you're sharing a file, and lists the file's size, type, and name. If it's an image
file, the chat window shows a preview, as in Figure 6-20. Your friend can then choose whether to
download the file.

Figure 6-20. When you transfer an image using Google Talk, the recipient sees a preview of the
image and has the option of downloading it to his computer by clicking the download link below the
picture. (The Send Files button appears only when the recipient is online.)
NOTE
Not everyone you chat with can receive files transferred through Google Talk. If you're chatting with
someone who's using Gmail's chat feature ([click here]) or with someone using Google Talk through a
different IM service ([click here]), then you can't transfer files to that person. If the person you're
chatting with is unable to receive file transfers, you don't see a Send Files button at the top of the chat
window.
6.5.2. Receive a File
When someone you're chatting with sends you a file, you can accept the file or say, "No, thanks." Talk's file
transfer notification message tells you about the file that's on offer, and has Accept and Decline links, as Figure
6-21 shows. Click Accept to download the file to your computer or Decline to cancel the transfer. Either way,
Talk reports your response to your chat partner, so she knows what you did with the file.

Figure 6-21. When someone initiates a file transfer during a chat, Talk lets you know with a
notification message like this. Here, Lily is sharing a Word document. To download the file, click
Accept; to cancel the transfer, click Decline.
When you accept a file, Google creates a folder inside your My Documents folder called Google Talk Received
Files to hold the files it transfers. After you've transferred a file, you can open the file or the folder where
Google stashed it.
As with any file, think before you download. If you're chatting with someone you don't
know well, don't accept a file transfer. You don't want to accidentally infect your
computer with a virus.
 

 
6.6. Inviting Web Site Visitors to Chat with You
If you've ever wished for an easy way to connect with your adoring fans, Google Talk chatback badges are for
you. A chatback badge lets people who visit your blog or Web site chat with you, even if they don't have Google
Accounts. The badge, shown in Figure 6-22, looks like a little word balloon, and shows your current status. If
you're online and available, visitors to your site can click the badge to launch a chat session with you.
Figure 6-22. A Google Talk chatback badge lets anyone who visits your Web page start a chat with
you. To change what the badge says, click Edit (circled), and the page expands to give you the
options shown here.
To create a chatback badge, sign into your Google Account, and then point your Web browser to
www.google.com/talk/service/badge/New. If you use Talk through your organization's Google Apps account
(Chapter 10 and Chapter 11), go to this URL: www.google.com/talk/service/a/MyOrganization/badge/New,
replacing MyOrganization with the your company's domain name. Google automatically generates the code for
your chatback badge so you can copy it and paste it into an HTML page, and then upload it to your site.
If you want, you can edit the badge (click Edit to expand the page) by tinkering with these elements:
Title. You can change the top line of the badge to text you choose, such as Let's chat! or Click to chat
with me—whatever you want. If you leave the Title field blank, the badge reads Chat with [your name].
Your nickname. This is the name Talk shows in the badge and to your chat partners.

Show your status message. The badge shows whether you're currently online, using the Available or
Offline icons shown in Table 6-1. If you want it to display your status message ([click here]), too, then
turn on this checkbox.
After you've inserted a chatback badge on your Web page or blog, anyone who clicks it can chat with you.
People who contact you this way don't automatically get added to your Friends list—if you want to add them,
you have to do so manually ([click here]). Chatback badge chats are one-on-one (you can chat with several
different people, but each chat has its own window). If you want to allow group chats, put the Google Talk
gadget ([click here]) on your Web page instead.
If you're online but don't have time to chat with visitors to your Web page, set your
status to Busy. This turns off your chatback badge, so people can't contact you that
way. In the meantime, though, you can chat with your Google Talk friends, and they can
chat with you. (You can write a custom Busy message that lets them know it's okay to
chat, like Available for important questions. To turn the badge back on, set your status
to Available.
If your fans are constantly pestering you to chat, you can delete the chatback badge. Just delete the code you
inserted to add it to your HTML page, and then re-publish the badge-free version of the page. Alternatively, you
can disable a badge, which means the badge stays on your page, but it always displays your status as Offline.
To disable a badge, go back to the page where you created the badge (the one shown in Figure 6-22), and then
click the "Disable old badges" link. On the confirmation page that opens, click Disable.
 

 
6.7. Signing Out of Google Talk
Some people never, ever sign out of Google Talk. They fire it up automatically when they start their computer
and leave it running until they shut everything down at the end of the day. From time to time, though, you
might want a little peace and quiet as you work. Just because you set your status to Busy doesn't mean your
friends will leave you alone. Your best bet is to sign out of Google Talk, so your friends see your status as
"Offline". They can still send you an offline message ([click here]), but you won't get peppered with questions
about what you thought of last night's American Idol episode or photos of a colleague's niece's baby shower.
You've got two ways to sign out of Google Talk:
From the main Talk window. Click the down arrow next to your current status, and then select "Sign
out".
From the System Tray. Right-click the Google Talk icon (Figure 6-15), and then click "Sign out".
However you sign out, Google closes any open chat windows and changes the main Talk window to the sign-in
window. Now, your friends see "Offline" for your status, and you have to sign back in if you want to chat or
make a voice call ([click here]).
 

 
6.8. The Google Talk Gadget: Taking Talk with You
If your system doesn't meet the requirements for the Google Talk program (see [click here]), or if you're on a
public computer that doesn't have the program installed, fear not: You can still use Google Talk to chat. The
Google Talk gadget embeds Google Talk into a Web page—either your iGoogle page (Chapter 8) or your own
Web site—so you can chat with Google Talk from just about any computer that's hooked up to the Internet. Just
open a Web browser, sign into the Google Talk gadget (wherever you've put it), and start chatting.
NOTE
To use the Google Talk gadget, you need to install the most recent version of Adobe Flash Player;
download it (for free) from www.adobe.com.
As the box on [click here] explains, the Google Talk gadget is a bit different from the Google Talk program. You
can use the gadget to chat and save conversations to your chat history ([click here]), and you can take a gadget
chat off the record ([click here]), but you can't transfer files using the gadget or make voice calls with it.
The Google Talk gadget has a couple of advantages over the Google Talk client beyond accessibility, though,
including multi-person chatting, showing videos and slideshows right in the chat window, and even a bunch of
cute smiley face icons to add a bit of feeling to your words. This section explains 'em all.
6.8.1. Put the Gadget on Your iGoogle Page
To put the Google Talk Gadget on your personalized iGoogle page (Chapter 8), follow these steps:
Go to www.igoogle.com, sign into your Google Account ([click here]), and then click the right-hand "Add
Stuff" link.
Google opens its Gadgets page.
1.
In the right-hand "Search for gadgets" box, type in Google Talk, and then click Search.
Google returns results for your search.
2.
You want the gadget named Google Talk, created by Google (it's probably the top search result). Find that
gadget, and then click its "Add it now" button.
Google adds the Google Talk gadget to your iGoogle page.
3.
Click the upper-left "Back to iGoogle home" link to start chatting.
Back on iGoogle, the Google Talk gadget is ready to use, as shown in Figure 6-23.
4.

Figure 6-23. With the Google Talk gadget (boxed), you can chat right on your iGoogle page.
The gadget shows your Friends list, and displays a message asking if you want to add the gadget to your
bookmarks or favorites. If you click Yes, Google adds the gadget to your list of bookmarks (in Firefox) or
Favorites (in Internet Explorer). When you click that bookmark or favorite, your Web browser opens the gadget,
so you can chat from wherever on the Web you happen to be.
iGoogle is a snap to customize. If you don't like where the Google Talk gadget is on your
iGoogle home page, then click its blue bar, and drag it to a different spot. For more
about customizing your iGoogle page, hop over to [click here].
6.8.2. Put the Gadget on Your Own Web Page
All it takes to add the Talk Gadget to your personal Web page is one little line of HTML, which you don't even

have to write yourself. Just pop over to www.google.com/support/talkgadget. From there, click "Setting up"
"How do I add the gadget to my website?" and then click the word "here" in the sentence "You can find the code
and directions for adding it here." (You can also save a few clicks by heading straight to the code via this
shortcut: http://tinyurl.com/2z3ed6.) This action takes you to the page shown in Figure 6-24, which shows what
the gadget will look like on your Web page.
Figure 6-24. Before generating the HTML code you need to add the Google Talk Gadget to your Web
page, Google previews how the gadget will look ([click here] tells you how to tweak the appearance,
if you like).
Figure 6-25 and the following list explain the appearance settings you can change:
Title. If you want to give the gadget a title, such as Chat With Me!, type the title here.

Width/Height. If parts of the gadget look cut off in the preview, increase either or both of these settings
(in pixels).
Border. Change the color and style of the box that holds the gadget to make it match your Web page's
color scheme.
Figure 6-25. If the preview doesn't look right, you can adjust the gadget's width and height, and
give it a title and a border.
Play around with the settings a bit, and then click the Preview Changes button to see how the gadget will look.
When you're satisfied, click the "Get the Code" button.
Google generates the HTML you need to put the gadget on your Web page. Copy the code, paste it into an HTML
page, and then upload that page to your site. Now you've got the gadget on your Web page, and you can chat
with your Google Talk friends from there.
6.8.3. Chat Using the Gadget
When you've added the Google Talk gadget to iGoogle or your Web page, you can see your Friends list, just as

you do when you use the regular Google Talk program. To start chatting, click someone's name. The gadget
opens the chat window on a new tab within the gadget's box, as Figure 6-26 shows. Type a comment and hit
Enter to start chatting. As you chat, if you move away from this chat's tab (by clicking another tab), the chat's
tab turns orange when you receive a new message. Click the chat's tab to see what your friend typed.
Figure 6-26. When you chat using the gadget, the chat window opens on a new tab in the gadget. To
open a new browser window for chatting, click the upper-right "Pop out" link (circled).
One of the fun things you can do with the Talk gadget is add smiley face icons (also known as emoticons) to
your chat. Click the happy-face button to the right of the text box where you type. A menu opens where you can
choose the icon that best expresses your feelings, as shown in Figure 6-27; click the one you want. Google

inserts the text version of that icon into the text box (it's made up of punctuation marks), but when you hit
Enter to send your message, Google inserts the cartoon smiley, frown, or whatever into the chat.
Figure 6-27. The Talk gadget lets you express emotions with this icon gallery. Click the lower-right
happy-face button (circled) to open the selection menu where you make your choice. You can also
choose from three different styles (also circled): round, square, or text-only characters.

NOTE

Emoticons show up as animated cartoon faces in the Talk gadget and in Gmail chat, but they appear the
old-fashioned, text-based way in chats using the Google Talk client: A happy face shows up as :), a mad
face as x-(, and so on.
If the little chat window in the gadget makes you feel a bit claustrophobic, click the upper-right "Pop out" link
(you can see it in Figure 6-26). This opens your chat in a new window, which you can resize by dragging its
border. Popping out your chat means you don't need to keep coming back to iGoogle to participate in your
chat—you can keep the chat going even as you zip around the Web.
To leave a chat, just close its tab by either clicking the X on the right side of the tab, or—if you've popped it
out—closing the chat window.
6.8.4. Chat with a Group of People
Sometimes you're in the mood for a quiet conversation; other times you want a party. A one-on-one chat can
feel like sitting down with a friend for a cup of coffee. A group chat, on the other hand, is more like getting the
whole gang together for a big, raucous bash. One of the best reasons to use the Google Talk gadget is that it
lets you chat with a whole bunch of people, as opposed to limiting your conversations to one person at a time.
As Figure 6-28 shows, the gadget's chat window has a Group Chat link at the top. When you're chatting with
somebody, click that link to invite someone else to join you. A drop-down menu opens, displaying names from
your Friends list. Click a name (or type in an email address), and Google invites that person to your chat party.
Figure 6-28. Group chats like this one look just like regular chats—there are just more people
participating. Click the Group Chat link (circled) to invite others to join the conversation.

6.8.5. Show Videos and Slideshows
The Google Talk Gadget adds some excitement to your chats by letting you show videos and slideshows right in
the chat window. This works with videos from YouTube and Google Video, as well as slideshows from Flickr or
your Picasa Web album. When you copy a Web address from one of these sites and paste it into your chat
window's text box, the window displays the video or slideshow, as Figure 6-29 illustrates. Your chat partner can
click the Play link to watch the video or slideshow right in the chat window, or open it in a new browser window
by clicking "Go to page".

Figure 6-29. To view a video or slideshow your friend sends during a chat, click either Play or "Go to
page" (both circled).
NOTE
Because the Google Talk gadget uses Flash technology, it's a little picky about how you copy and paste
into the chat window. When you copy the URL of a YouTube video, for example, you have to follow this
sequence: Press Ctrl (or 
) and hold it down while you press C. Next, take your finger off C, and then
let go of the Ctrl (or 
) key. To paste what you just copied into your chat, follow the same one-key-at-
a-time sequence, substituting V for C.
 

 
6.9. Google Talk and Gmail
One of the things that makes Google Talk so easy to use is how it works with Gmail. If you have a Gmail
account ([click here]), your Gmail Contacts list and your Google Talk Friends list automatically update each
other; when you send someone an email, Google thinks, "Hmmm...this person would also be good to chat
with"—and the person's name appears on your Friends list as a potential chat partner. If you use chat history
([click here]), then Google stores the chat transcripts in your Gmail Chats folder. Voicemail messages appear in
your Gmail inbox, and you can listen to them in Gmail ([click here]). You can even chat with any of your Google
Talk friends right from Gmail, as explained in the next section.
6.9.1. Chatting in Gmail
Gmail's left-hand menu has a section labeled Chat (click the down arrow if you can't see its contents). The Chat
section shows your Google Talk Friends list. Hover over someone's name to see her profile card ([click here]), or
click her name to launch a chat. Figure 6-30 shows what chatting in Gmail looks like.
Figure 6-30. Your Google Talk Friends list appears in Gmail under Chat (circled). You can view the
same profile cards as in Google Talk, or click a name to open a chat window. To open the chat in a
new browser window, click Pop-out (also circled).
Gmail's chat window should look familiar. Just type in the text box, and then hit Enter (Return) to send a
message. Click Options to go off the record ([click here]), block your current chat partner ([click here]), or
invite others to a group chat ([click here]). The lower-right smiley-face button lets you select and insert smiley
faces and other mood icons ([click here]). And if your chat needs more space, you can pop it out ([click here])
and resize the window. Change your status by clicking the "Set status here" link (Gmail automatically sets your
status to Available unless you change it).
6.9.1.1. Gmail Chat and AOL Instant Messenger

If you're one of the many people who use AOL Instant Messenger (AIM), rejoice: Google now lets you sign into
AIM through Gmail. You can then chat with anyone and everyone on your AIM buddy list—as well as your Gmail
chat contacts.
NOTE
If you sign into Gmail through your organization's Google Apps account (if your email address is
janedoe@mycompany.com instead of janedoe@gmail.com, for example), you can't chat with your AIM
buddies through Gmail chat.
The first time you IM one of your AIM buddies through Gmail, he'll see a brief message saying your
conversations will be saved in Gmail's chat history ([click here]); other than that, it'll look just like a normal AIM
conversation. Your AIM buddies will see your AIM screen name, and you Gmail contacts will see your actual
name (or whatever you entered as your first and last names when you signed up). Integrating Gmail chat and
AIM takes only a minute.
NOTE
To chat with your AIM buddies through Gmail, you need either Internet Explorer 7 or Firefox 2 as your
Web browser. You can upgrade by going to www.microsoft.com/windows/downloads or www.firefox.com.
To chat from Gmail using AIM, you need to be signed in to Gmail chat. (In Gmail's left-hand menu, under Chat,
click the "Sign into chat" link.) Once you're signed in to Gmail chat, follow these steps to sign into AIM through
Gmail chat:
In the left-hand Chat section, under your name, click the down arrow next to "Set status here" (under
your name)—or click the Options link at the bottom of the Chat section—and then select "Sign into AIM".
A sign-in box opens, as shown in Figure 6-31. From here, you can sign into AIM or, if you don't have an
AIM screen name, register for one.
Figure 6-31. To sign into AIM from Google chat for the first time, enter your AIM screen
name and password. If you don't have an AIM screen name, click "Get a screen name"
to sign up for an AIM account.
1.

Type your AIM screen name and password, and then click "Sign in."
Google imports your AIM buddies into Gmail chat.
2.
Click Done.
Google takes you back to Gmail, where your AIM buddies now appear on Chat list, as shown in Figure 6-
32. Click a buddy's name to start a chat.
3.
Figure 6-32. After you've signed in to AIM through Gmail, your AIM buddies appear as contacts, with
the AIM running-man logo (circled) next to their screen names. If you don't see a buddy on the list,
use the Chat search box (also circled) to find her.

After you've followed these steps, you can sign in and out of AIM from the "Set status here" or Options menu.
Just click the drop-down arrow next to either one, and then choose "Sign into AIM" to see your buddies. To sign
out of AIM, repeat the process, selecting "Sign out of AIM" instead. When you do that, your AIM buddies
disappear from the Chat contacts list—sign into AIM again to bring them back.
6.9.1.2. Sign into AIM with a different screen name
Some people have different screen names they use to chat in different contexts—with colleagues, with family,
with friends, with fellow Star Trek fanatics, and so on. If you have more than one AIM screen name, you can use
Gmail chat to chat using each of them.
To change from one AIM screen name to another, go to Gmail's Settings page (click the upper-right Settings
link), click the Chat tab, and then, at the bottom of the page, click "Change AIM settings" (this section appears
on the Chat tab only after you've signed into AIM through Gmail). This sequence opens the sign-in box shown
back in Figure 6-31. Type in the screen name and password you want to use, and then click Done. Gmail chat
signs you in using the AIM screen name you chose.
 

 
6.10. Making Free Voice Calls over the Internet
Why just chat when you can talk? Sometimes you can get your point across faster when you can tell it—not type
it—like it is. Besides, all that typing can wear out your fingers. If your computer has speakers and a microphone
(or better yet, a headset that lets you both speak and listen), you can make free computer-to-computer voice
calls over the Internet. Google Talk lets you make voice calls, leave a voicemail message, and listen to
voicemails others leave for you via Google Talk. The technology behind these calls is called VoIP, which is
pronounced just like it's spelled—"voip"—and stands for "Voice over Internet Protocol." Some people also refer
to VoIP as "Internet telephony." Whatever you call it, making voice calls online is pretty neat—and free.
Voice calls need the Google Talk client to work. (You can place a call through the Google Talk gadget, but only if
you've got the client open in the background.) And the person you call also needs to have everything in place:
microphone and speakers or a headset and the Google Talk program installed ([click here] has info about
changing your audio settings for VoIP calls).
NOTE
Because you need the Google Talk client installed to make voice calls, Mac and Linux fans can't make
voice calls using Google Talk.
6.10.1. Placing a Voice Call
When a friend is online, a little picture of a telephone appears next to her picture on your Friends list. Click a
telephone to start a voice call. (Alternatively, you can hover over the friend's name to show her profile card, and
then click the Call button.)
Google sends the call over the Internet. You hear a ringing noise that sounds just like you're making a regular
phone call; at the same time, your friend receives a notification that she has a voice call. When she clicks
Answer, the call connects.
While you're talking, your chat window looks like the one in Figure 6-33. The messages in the chat area show
the status of your call, and you see these options at the top of the window:
End Call. Click this button when you're finished speaking.
Send Files. You can transfer files during a voice call by clicking this button and following the steps for
transferring a file ([click here]).
Mute. Turn your microphone off or on by clicking this button.
Microphone. The bars here change color when you're speaking into the mic.

Speaker. These bars change color when you're receiving audio.
Call strength. On the right, just above the chat area, these little bars show whether the call is coming
through loud and clear or if it's on the weak side.
When you're done with the call, click the End Call button to disconnect.
Figure 6-33. When you make a voice call, your chat window looks like this. Use the buttons at the
top to mute your mic, send a file, or end the call. You can also type to chat in the usual way during a
voice call—helpful if you want to share a Web address or the spelling of some particularly complex
word.
6.10.2. Answering a Voice Call
When someone rings you up using Google Talk, the notifications you receive depend on your Google Talk
settings ([click here]): You can hear a ringtone, see a pop-up window, or both. In addition, your chat window
changes to look like the one in Figure 6-34. You can respond to an incoming call in two ways:
Click Answer to "pick up." When you do, your chat window changes to look like the one in Figure 6-33.
Click Ignore if you don't want to talk right now. Google Talk gives the caller the option of leaving you a

voicemail (see the next section).
Figure 6-34. When you receive a call, the chat window shows who's calling. You can answer or
ignore it and send the caller to voicemail.
Instead of clicking the Ignore button, you can also just ignore the call by doing nothing. In that case, the call
switches over to voicemail after four rings.

Troubleshooting Moment: Can You Hear Me Now?
If you can't hear your friend during a voice call—or your friend can't hear you—a few different
things might be causing the problem. Check the obvious suspects first: Are your speakers and mic
(or headset) plugged in properly? Are your speakers turned on?
If all those things are OK, in Google Talk, go to Settings
Audio. In the Input and Output
sections, are the correct speakers and mic selected? If not, choose your devices from the drop-
down lists. Is the checkbox labeled "Unmute speaker and microphone while on a call" turned off? If
it is, then turning on that checkbox may solve the problem.
Also check is to make sure that your microphone's turned on at a reasonable volume by following
these steps:
In Windows, click Start
Settings
Control Panel. The Windows Control Panel opens.
1.
Double-click "Sounds and Audio Devices" to open the Sounds and Audio Devices Properties
box.
2.
Click the Volume tab (if it's not already open), and then, in the "Device volume" section, click
Advanced. The Volume Control box opens.
3.
Look for a section labeled Microphone. (If you don't see it, click Options
Properties and, in
the volume controls list, turn on the Microphone checkbox.) If Microphone's Mute checkbox is
turned on, turn it off. Also, make sure that the microphone's Volume slider is around the
middle of the scale. When the microphone settings look good, click the upper-right X to close
the Volume Control box.
4.
Back in the Sounds and Audio Devices Properties box, click OK.
Now your friend should be able to hear you when you call her. If you can't hear her, make
sure she goes through these steps to adjust her mic.
5.
6.10.3. Leaving Voicemail Messages
People rely on voicemail so much that sometimes it can be a surprise when somebody actually picks up the
phone. So it's a good thing that Google Talk has voicemail built in, letting you leave a message when someone
is offline, busy, or just screening their calls.
You've got three ways to leave a Google Talk voicemail:
When someone doesn't answer. If a contact is online but can't talk right now, he'll either click the
Ignore button or just not answer. In either case, your call gets switched to his voicemail.

When someone is offline. You can't place a live call to someone who's not signed in to Google Talk, but
you can leave that person a voicemail. In the main Google Talk window, hover your cursor over the
person's name so her profile card appears, and then click the "Send voicemail" button to connect straight
to her voicemail.
When you want to leave a voicemail, not have a conversation. Sometimes, you'd rather not hear
the gory details about Aunt Ida's bursitis or a play-by-play of Joey's Little League game. To go straight to
an online contact's voicemail, hover your cursor over the person's name to see his profile card, and then
click the "Send voicemail" button. If you don't see that button, click the upper-right drop-down arrow, and
then choose "Send voicemail".
However you reach the voicemail system, you see a chat window like the one in Figure 6-33 and hear a "not
available" message, and then get a chance to leave your message. Voicemails, which Google saves as MP3 files,
can be up to 10 minutes long—so watch out when Aunt Ida sends you a voicemail in reply!
After you end the call, the person you left the message for gets a new-voicemail notification right away (if she's
online) or the next time she signs in to Google Talk or Gmail.
6.10.4. Listening to Your Voicemail Messages
Google sends voicemails to your registered email account (the one you used to set up your Google Account—see
[click here]), so check your inbox for a message with the subject line Voicemail from..., as shown in Figure 6-
35. If you use Gmail, then you can open the email and play its voice message immediately. If you don't have a
Gmail account, you can download the attached MP3 file, and then play it using your computer's music program.
Figure 6-35. Google sends voicemails to your email account. In Gmail, you can spot them by the
subject line and by the phone icon (circled). Click a voicemail to listen to it.
When a voicemail message arrives in your Gmail Inbox, click it to open the message. You'll see something like
the example in Figure 6-36. To listen to your voicemail, you can play it right in Gmail, open a new window to
play it, or download it to your computer.

Figure 6-36. When you open a voicemail in Gmail, you can play the message by clicking the play
button (circled), or click one of the links to open and play the message in a new window or download
the MP3 file to your computer. To respond with a voicemail of your own, click the "Google Talk" link,
or click the "Reply by chat" link to send a chat message. If you'd rather send an email response,
click "Reply" or just start typing in the text box at the bottom of the message.
As Figure 6-36 shows, Gmail gives you a bunch of different ways to respond to a voicemail: by return voicemail,
by chat, or by email. Take your pick.
 

 
Chapter 7. Tracking Schedules with Google Calendar
As you rush through your days, it can feel like the clock's always ticking. Meetings, appointments, lunches, kids'
events, deadlines, errands—are you tearing out your hair yet? Google can't make your schedule less busy, but it
can help keep track of what's going on, minimizing conflicts and giving you a heads-up when you've got to be
somewhere.
Google Calendar is an online program that tracks the events in your life. Because it's online, you can access it
from anywhere you can get on the Web. Another perk: Since your calendar is, in effect, an easily editable Web
page, it's a snap to coordinate your schedule with other people. For instance, you can share calendars, so you
can see when friends and colleagues are available, and vice versa. Similarly, when you schedule an event, you
can send out invitations, keep track of the RSVPs, and even discuss the event with your guests—all right from
your calendar. You can also synchronize your Google Calendar with BlackBerry's built-in calendar, Microsoft
Outlook Calendar, Yahoo Calendar, or Apple iCal, so you've got multiple ways of working with your schedule.
This chapter teaches you everything you need to know to get going with Google Calendar. Just be sure to pencil
in a half-hour here and there for a sanity break.
7.1. Getting Started with Google Calendar
Before you start using Google Calendar, make sure you have the right equipment. At this writing, Google
Calendar works with these Web browsers:
Microsoft Internet Explorer (IE) version 6.0 and 7.0 (for Windows)
Firefox version 1.0.7 or later (for Windows, Mac, and Linux)
Apple Safari 2.0.3 and 2.0.4 for Mac OS X 10.4
Make sure your browser also has both JavaScript and cookies enabled (the box on [click here] tells you how).
7.1.1. Signing Up and Signing In
If you already have a Google Account, go to www.google.com/accounts, sign in, and then add Calendar via your
"Try something new" section ([click here]). Or you can go straight to calendar.google.com, and then sign in
there using your Google Account login info. Either way, before Google creates your Calendar account, it asks for
a bit of info, as Figure 7-1 shows. If you need to make any adjustments to your name, location, or time zone,
do so here, and then click Continue.
Figure 7-1. You wouldn't want your calendar to be in a different time zone from you, so confirm your
name, location, and time zone here. The time zone you select comes into play when you travel, since
Google lets you modify your settings to pick your current time zone. So all those phone conferences
you scheduled for 1:00 p.m. Eastern Time now become 10:00 a.m. Pacific Time on your surprise trip
to L.A. (full details are on [click here]).

Google creates your Calendar account, and takes you to its home page, shown in Figure 7-2.
Figure 7-2. When you create a Google Calendar account, Google displays a calendar that's ready for
you to start adding events. Click Create Event or Quick Add (both circled) to do just that. You can
page through the current calendar using its upper-left navigation buttons, or switch views using the
tabs on the right (labeled Day, Week, and so on).

NOTE
If you don't yet have a Google Account and want to use Google Calendar, go to
http://calendar.google.com, and then click the blue "Create an account" button. Google asks for a valid
email address and password to set up your new Google Account; it also asks for the info shown in Figure
7-2, to create your new Calendar account. When you click "I accept. Create my account", Google sets
you up with both a Google Account and a Calendar account. To see what your new Google Account is all
about, flip back to Chapter 1.
7.1.2. The Google Calendar Home Page: A Quick Tour
When Google creates your Calendar account, it also creates your first calendar, looking very much like the one
shown in Figure 7-2. If you've ever worked with a computer-based calendar, this page should look pretty
familiar. (If your daybook has previously involved nothing more high-tech than paper and a pen, you'll still have
no trouble finding your way around.)
The calendar itself takes up the main part of the page. You can change the view to focus on a busy day or take
a longer-range look at your schedule. Click a tab on the right side of the page to switch between these views
(they're explained in detail on [click here]):

Day
Week
Month
Next 4 days
Agenda
On the left side of the screen, the Create Event and Quick Add links offer two different ways to add an
appointment, meeting, movie date, or other event ([click here] gives step-by-step instructions for creating an
event).
Below those links is a monthly mini-calendar, highlighting today's date and whichever time period matches the
view you've chosen. For example, in Figure 7-2, the calendar is in Week view, so the monthly calendar
highlights the current week. If you switch to Day view, just one day gets highlighted; in Month view, the whole
month is highlighted, and so on. Click a particular day in the mini-calendar, and the main calendar jumps to that
day.
To see what all the different views look like, flip to [click here].
Google lets you create and track multiple calendars, all of which can coexist within Google Calendar. So, for
example, you can keep track of your spouse's calendar and the kids' sports schedules, your boss's
appointments, the production schedule of the local community theater, and other events you want to track;
[click here] tells more about managing your calendar list. Below the mini-calendar is a list of all these calendars.
Just above the main calendar, you see some basic navigation buttons. Click the right and left arrows to move
the calendar forward or backward by one unit, depending on the view you've chosen. For example, if you're in
Week view, clicking the right navigation arrow moves the selected area of the calendar forward by one week.
When you're ready to get back to the present, click the Today button to show the current day in whatever view
you've chosen. (The Today button is grayed out if you can see today in the current view.)
To quickly move forward or backward to a different month, to the left of the main
calendar, use the small monthly calendar. Its right and left arrows (>> and <<) let you
jump forward or backward a month at a time.
The top of the Calendar home page has a search box, which lets you do two kinds of searches:
Search public Google Calendars.

Search your own Google Calendars.
For either kind of search, clicking the Show Search Options link to the right of the search buttons brings up
advanced options, so you can specify exactly what you're looking for ([click here] tells you how to search Google
Calendars).

7.1. Getting Started with Google Calendar
Before you start using Google Calendar, make sure you have the right equipment. At this writing, Google
Calendar works with these Web browsers:
Microsoft Internet Explorer (IE) version 6.0 and 7.0 (for Windows)
Firefox version 1.0.7 or later (for Windows, Mac, and Linux)
Apple Safari 2.0.3 and 2.0.4 for Mac OS X 10.4
Make sure your browser also has both JavaScript and cookies enabled (the box on [click here] tells you how).
7.1.1. Signing Up and Signing In
If you already have a Google Account, go to www.google.com/accounts, sign in, and then add Calendar via your
"Try something new" section ([click here]). Or you can go straight to calendar.google.com, and then sign in
there using your Google Account login info. Either way, before Google creates your Calendar account, it asks for
a bit of info, as Figure 7-1 shows. If you need to make any adjustments to your name, location, or time zone,
do so here, and then click Continue.
Figure 7-1. You wouldn't want your calendar to be in a different time zone from you, so confirm your
name, location, and time zone here. The time zone you select comes into play when you travel, since
Google lets you modify your settings to pick your current time zone. So all those phone conferences
you scheduled for 1:00 p.m. Eastern Time now become 10:00 a.m. Pacific Time on your surprise trip
to L.A. (full details are on [click here]).

Google creates your Calendar account, and takes you to its home page, shown in Figure 7-2.
Figure 7-2. When you create a Google Calendar account, Google displays a calendar that's ready for
you to start adding events. Click Create Event or Quick Add (both circled) to do just that. You can
page through the current calendar using its upper-left navigation buttons, or switch views using the
tabs on the right (labeled Day, Week, and so on).

NOTE
If you don't yet have a Google Account and want to use Google Calendar, go to
http://calendar.google.com, and then click the blue "Create an account" button. Google asks for a valid
email address and password to set up your new Google Account; it also asks for the info shown in Figure
7-2, to create your new Calendar account. When you click "I accept. Create my account", Google sets
you up with both a Google Account and a Calendar account. To see what your new Google Account is all
about, flip back to Chapter 1.
7.1.2. The Google Calendar Home Page: A Quick Tour
When Google creates your Calendar account, it also creates your first calendar, looking very much like the one
shown in Figure 7-2. If you've ever worked with a computer-based calendar, this page should look pretty
familiar. (If your daybook has previously involved nothing more high-tech than paper and a pen, you'll still have
no trouble finding your way around.)
The calendar itself takes up the main part of the page. You can change the view to focus on a busy day or take
a longer-range look at your schedule. Click a tab on the right side of the page to switch between these views
(they're explained in detail on [click here]):

Day
Week
Month
Next 4 days
Agenda
On the left side of the screen, the Create Event and Quick Add links offer two different ways to add an
appointment, meeting, movie date, or other event ([click here] gives step-by-step instructions for creating an
event).
Below those links is a monthly mini-calendar, highlighting today's date and whichever time period matches the
view you've chosen. For example, in Figure 7-2, the calendar is in Week view, so the monthly calendar
highlights the current week. If you switch to Day view, just one day gets highlighted; in Month view, the whole
month is highlighted, and so on. Click a particular day in the mini-calendar, and the main calendar jumps to that
day.
To see what all the different views look like, flip to [click here].
Google lets you create and track multiple calendars, all of which can coexist within Google Calendar. So, for
example, you can keep track of your spouse's calendar and the kids' sports schedules, your boss's
appointments, the production schedule of the local community theater, and other events you want to track;
[click here] tells more about managing your calendar list. Below the mini-calendar is a list of all these calendars.
Just above the main calendar, you see some basic navigation buttons. Click the right and left arrows to move
the calendar forward or backward by one unit, depending on the view you've chosen. For example, if you're in
Week view, clicking the right navigation arrow moves the selected area of the calendar forward by one week.
When you're ready to get back to the present, click the Today button to show the current day in whatever view
you've chosen. (The Today button is grayed out if you can see today in the current view.)
To quickly move forward or backward to a different month, to the left of the main
calendar, use the small monthly calendar. Its right and left arrows (>> and <<) let you
jump forward or backward a month at a time.
The top of the Calendar home page has a search box, which lets you do two kinds of searches:
Search public Google Calendars.

Search your own Google Calendars.
For either kind of search, clicking the Show Search Options link to the right of the search buttons brings up
advanced options, so you can specify exactly what you're looking for ([click here] tells you how to search Google
Calendars).
 

 
7.2. Creating a Calendar
There's something inspiring about a brand-new calendar, ready to be filled up with events. All that potential:
lunch dates, concerts, dinner parties—and oh yeah, staff meetings, dentist appointments, and car tune-ups, too.
In addition to the calendar that Google starts you off with, you can create other calendars. For example, maybe
you're the director of a community arts association, and want to publish a list of talks and events. Or maybe you
like to plan family dinners a week at a time, or you're starting a garden and want to keep track of planting
season. You get the idea.
To create a new calendar, go to your left-hand My Calendars list, and then click Add
"Create a new
calendar". This opens the Create New Calendar page, shown in Figure 7-3. (You can also get to this page by
selecting Settings
Calendars
"Create new calendar".)
Figure 7-3. The Create New Calendar page is where you get a new calendar up and running. Calendar
Name (circled) is the only required field on this page. When you've filled out as much of the form as
you want, at the bottom of the form, click the Create Calendar button.
The Create New Calendar page has these sections:
Calendar Name. Giving each calendar a descriptive name makes them more distinctive.

Description. If you want, write a description of your calendar, which is helpful for shared or public
calendars.
Location. This field is also useful for public calendars. If you're tracking, say, concerts in Kalamazoo or
mixers for single professionals in Boise, let the world know.
Calendar Time Zone. Select the appropriate country and time zone for your calendar.
If you're on the road, you can change your calendar's time zone to match where
you are—[click here] tells you how.
Make this calendar public. Share your calendar with the world, when you want to do things like
publicize events. That way, others can add your calendar to their account. Flip to [click here] for details.
Share with specific people. If you're managing a project at work, for example, you can create a
calendar listing meetings and deadlines, and then share it with your coworkers. Read about sharing
calendars on [click here].
7.2.1. Adding Events
An empty calendar doesn't tell you much beyond what day it is. To start filling up your calendar, you need to
add an event. (Google calls whatever's happening in your life—meetings, appointments, dinner dates, fitness
classes, and so on—events.) Start by clicking the left-hand Create Event link to open the page shown in Figure
7-4.
Figure 7-4. When you create a new event in Google Calendar, the What and the When are required
info, so Google knows what to write on your calendar and when to schedule it. Everything else is
optional.

The event scheduling page has three sections:
An event creation section in the upper left.
Options for reminders ([click here]) and privacy ([click here]) in the lower left.
A place to add guests you want to invite to the event (as explained on [click here]) on the right.
To create an event, go to the upper-left section, and then fill in this information:
What. Name the event so you know what it's all about. "Lunch with Rachel" and "Flight to Phoenix" are
good, descriptive names.
When. This includes the dates and times when the event starts and ends. So if the event is a 3-day
conference, for example, you need to create it only once, and Google fills in 3 days on the calendar. If the
event will last all day, turn on the "All day" checkbox so Google knows to devote the whole day to that
event. If it'll take only a couple of hours, make sure that checkbox is turned off, and then specify when the
event will happen.
Where (optional). Type in the event's location, so you won't waste time running up and down the
hallway trying to figure out which conference room your meeting's in. If you're adding an event that
repeats periodically, use the Repeats drop-down list to specify how often the event recurs ([click here] has
more on repeating events).

Description (optional). If you're adding Battle of the Bands to a public calendar that promotes concerts,
for example, it'd be helpful to list the names of participating bands here.
When you've filled in the info you want, click Save, and Google adds the event to your calendar.
7.2.1.1. Quick Add
You're busy and Google is all about saving you time. Check out an even faster way to add an event by clicking
the Quick Add link. The box shown in Figure 7-5 pops up and invites you to type a one-line description of the
event, along these lines: Sales meeting 7/2 noon-2:30 or Basketball game next Saturday at 7:00. Click the +
sign, and Google creates and adds the event in a flash. Then you can view ([click here]) or edit ([click here])
the event.
Figure 7-5. Use Quick Add to jot a memo to yourself about an upcoming event, and Google interprets
what you write to create the event. Click the + sign (circled) to add the event to your calendar.
Google's pretty darn good at figuring out when and how you want your event listed on your Calendar. But here
are a few tips to make sure Quick Add understands you:
At a minimum, you have to enter a name for the event and when it will happen. Otherwise, Google can't
schedule it.
If Calendar is set to the 12-hour clock ([click here]), use p or pm to distinguish events that happen after
noon. If you don't, Google may think the event takes place in the morning.

If you type in a time but no date, then Google looks ahead to the earliest day that time rolls around again,
and slots the event in there. For example, if it's currently 11:00 a.m. and you type Conference call 10:30,
Google takes that to mean 10:30 tomorrow morning.
If you type in a start time but no end time, Google assumes the event lasts 1 hour.
If you type a date but no start time, Google lists the event as lasting all day.
If you're inviting someone to the event ([click here]), then type that person's email address into Quick
Add, and Google adds that person to your Guests list.
For multi-day events, use date ranges, like so: Executive retreat 8/2-8/4.
If you want to create a recurring event, include info about how often the event recurs, like this:
Anniversary 6/22 yearly or Piano lesson every Wednesday 5:30-6:15 or Golf first Sunday of the month.
When you use Quick Add to create a recurring event, don't interrupt the time with
other info, or Google might get confused. For example, instead of writing Softball
practice every Wednesday evening at Smith Park at 6p, write Softball practice at
Smith Park every Wednesday evening at 6p.
7.2.1.2. Add an event from the calendar
When someone suggests a time for an appointment or a meeting, how often do you say, "Hang on, let me check
my calendar"? When you look at a specific date on your Google Calendar, you can add an event by clicking the
date itself. As Figure 7-6 shows, a balloon appears that lets you quickly add an event to that date. Type in the
event, and then click Create Event to add it to the selected date. When you add an event this way, Google
assumes the event will take an hour. If you want to add more details than the balloon lets you, click "edit event
details" to open a page shown in Figure 7-4. There, you can specify an event's duration, add a location and
description, and more ([click here]).
Figure 7-6. You can add an event right from the calendar by clicking the event's date, and then filling
in the details.

If you use the Google Toolbar, its Google Calendar button lets you add events to your
calendar as you find those events on the Web; [click here] gives all the details.
7.2.1.3. Add an event from Gmail
Gmail users get a super-easy way to add events to their Google Calendar. When you receive an email that has
event information in it, Gmail shows an "Add to calendar" link to the right of the message. Click that link to
open a Create an Event page like the one shown in Figure 7-4, with the event details already filled in. If the
details need tweaking, tweak away. Then click Save Changes to add the event to your calendar.
7.2.1.4. Add a recurring event
If you belong to a book club that meets on the first Tuesday of every month or a kickball league that has a
game every Thursday after work, you don't have to add these events to your Google Calendar over and over
again. Just tell Google that the event happens on a regular basis. Here's how:
Click Create Event.
The Create Event page opens.
1.
2.

Fill in the event details. In the When section, click the Repeats drop-down list and choose the event's
frequency from the list. Your choices are daily; every weekday (Mon–Fri); every Monday, Wednesday, and
Friday; every Tuesday and Thursday; weekly; monthly; and yearly.
The When section expands to show the settings for the Repeat option you chose, like the example in
Figure 7-7.
Figure 7-7. When you select a frequency from the Repeats drop-down list, the When
section expands so you can give Google more info. What you see in this section depends
on the frequency you chose. Here, someone creating events for the monthly book club
meeting can adjust the repetition schedule (every month, every other month, every
third month, and so on), choose whether to repeat by day of the month or day of the
week, and specify start and end dates.
2.
If necessary, fine-tune the settings. (The options you have depend on your Repeat frequency.) For
example, for a meeting that happens every other month, you can select Monthly, and then set the
repetition frequency to 2 months, instead of 1. When you're done, click Save.
Google creates the event and, based on your frequency settings, inserts multiple instances into your
calendar.
3.

Maybe you have a recurring event that happens a couple of times a week but
doesn't fit into a Monday/Wednesday/Friday or Tuesday/Thursday pattern, like
softball practice on Tuesdays and a game every Saturday. To create your own
pattern, click the Repeats drop-down list, and then select Weekly. When the
section expands, turn on the pertinent days' checkboxes.
7.2.2. Create Reminders
You probably set analarm clock to let you know when it's time to wake up in the morning. In the same way, you
can set Google Calendar to remind you when an important event approaches. You can create a generic reminder
that applies to all events on your calendar, or you can make a custom reminder for a particular event.
7.2.2.1. Set reminders for a whole calendar
When you create a new event by clicking Create Event ([click here]) or adding the event from your calendar
([click here]), Google automatically creates a reminder to give you a heads-up when the event's start time
approaches. Unless you specify otherwise, the default reminder is a window that pops up on your computer 10
minutes before the event is scheduled to begin. If you use Quick Add to create an event, Google fills in just the
basics—the what and the when—without setting up any kind of reminder.
Ten minutes' warning from a pop-up window isn't your only option for reminders. You might prefer to get an
email the night before, for example, or a pop-up message that gives you half an hour's notice, and then set that
reminder to apply to the whole calendar. If you want to make sure that Google always reminds you when an
event's coming up (and in the way you prefer to be reminded), you can set up a reminder that's automatically
used for every new event you add to a specific calendar. That way, if you use Quick Add or you don't set up a
reminder when you create a new event, you don't have to go in and edit the event to make sure you get a
notification as it approaches.
Here's how to set up notifications that Google uses for all the events on a particular calendar:
On your screen's left side, find the calendar you want in your My Calendars list, click the down arrow to its
right, and then select Notifications. Alternatively, you can click the upper-right Settings link, and then click
Calendars; find the calendar you want, and then click its Notifications link.
Google opens the Notifications tab of the calendar's Details page, as shown in Figure 7-8. This page has
two sections:
Event reminders. This section is where you choose how and when you want to get notified that an
event is coming up. Google gives you two choices: It can email a notification or display a reminder
box on your computer screen. If you've set up your cellphone to work with Calendar ([click here]),
you can also get text-message reminders. If you want, you can get more than one kind of reminder
for a single event. For example, you might find it helpful to get an email notification the day before
the event, and then have a reminder box pop up 10 minutes before the event starts.
Choose how you would like to be notified. This section is somewhat misleadingly named, since
on first glance it appears to give you more choices about how you want your notifications delivered.
Instead, it actually pertains to invitations ([click here]) you send and receive. This section is also
1.

where you can tell Google to send you your daily agenda; it's almost like having your own personal
secretary type up your appointment list and leave it on your desk. You can get these notifications by
email or as a text message on your cellphone ([click here]) except for the daily agenda—Google
can't send that as a text message.
Tell Google how you want to be notified, and then click Save.
Google saves your settings so it can nudge you with reminders.
NOTE
Setting a notifications for your whole calendar applies only to events you create after you've set
the notification—existing events don't change.
2.
Figure 7-8. In the top part of the Notifications tab, tell Google how and when to remind you of
events on your calendar. Absent minded professor-types can create more than one reminder for each
event by clicking the "Add another reminder" link (circled). Or, if it feels like Google's getting a little
pushy, remove any reminders by clicking the remove link (also circled). The lower part of the page
tells Google how to deal with invitations ([click here]) and whether to send you a daily agenda
([click here]).
7.2.2.2. Set reminders for a particular event

Sometimes, you might want Google to handle reminders for a particular event differently from other events on
that calendar. For example, say your standard notification is a pop-up box that appears 10 minutes before the
event starts. That's fine for getting you down the hall to a meeting, but it's not going to help much if you need
to drive 45 minutes across town for a luncheon. Or say you've got an important deadline approaching. You
might want to get a reminder a week before the deadline, another one a couple of days later, and another on
the day it's due. But you don't want that pattern of reminders for everything on your calendar—that'd be
overkill.
Fortunately, you can customize an event's reminders when you create ([click here]) or edit ([click here]) that
event. When you do that, look in the Options section, shown in Figure 7-9. The Reminder options are just like
the Event Reminders options shown in Figure 7-8. Simply tell Google how and when you want to be reminded,
and then click Save when you're done. Voilà—your event now has its own, specific reminder settings.
Figure 7-9. In the Options section (circled), you set reminder and privacy options that apply just to
this particular event. (The "Show me as Available/Busy" option applies when you share your
calendar—see [click here]).
7.2.2.3. Set privacy options for an event
Google calendars can be private (for your eyes only) or public (shared with a group of specific people or the
world at large). When you make a calendar private, Google treats all its events as private—nobody but you can

see them. On the other hand, all the events on a public calendar can be viewed by anyone who shares that
calendar (if you publish the calendar [[click here]], that means anyone on the Internet).
There are plenty of situations, though, where you might want a private calendar to display a public event, or
vice versa. For example, maybe you're having a party and you've added it as an event to your private calendar,
but you want your invited guests to be able to see its details. Or imagine you maintain a public calendar of
events at a community center. You might find it helpful to schedule the steps you need to take to prepare for
each event, but you don't want your personal to-do list to show on the public calendar.
Google lets you designate individual events as public or private when you create or edit them. To do that, either
click the Create New link or find an event, click its name, select "edit event details", and then find the Options
section (Figure 7-9) on the page that opens.
You have three choices for an event's privacy settings:
Default. Turn on this radio button if you want the event's privacy setting to be the same as the privacy
setting for the calendar it's on.
Private. If the event's calendar is public, turn on this radio button if you want to make the event visible
only to you and anyone else who's allowed to make changes to events (see [click here]). The event will be
invisible to everyone else.
Public. For a private calendar, turn on this radio button to share the details of this event with others.
NOTE
Making an event on a private calendar public doesn't mean people will see the event's details in
public search results (see [click here]).
After you've chosen a new privacy setting for an event, don't forget to click Save to make the change stick.
7.2.3. Viewing Your Calendar
Sometimes it's helpful to get a bird's-eye view of the whole forest; other times, you need to focus on the trees
right in front of you. Whether you need a big-picture overview of your schedule or today's to-do list, one of
Google Calendars views is sure to show you what you need. You can display your schedule by the day, week,
month, next four days, or in an agenda-style listing. The following sections explain each view in detail.
7.2.3.1. Day view
Day view shows you today's—or any single's day's—events at a glance, as Figure 7-10 shows. Click the Day tab
to see this hour-by-hour breakdown of what's happening on a particular day, with colored blocks to represent
each event and its duration. An event lasting all day appears at the top of the page. Click a time slot to add an

event at that time.
7.2.3.2. Week view
Take in your week at a glance with Week view, shown in Figure 7-11. When you click the Week tab, your
calendar displays a column for each day of the week; half-hour time slots make up the rows. If you're looking at
the current week, the calendar highlights today. Events appear in blocks that show how long you've scheduled
for each event. Click a day and time to create an event in that time slot.
Figure 7-10. Click the Day tab (circled) to see what's planned for a specific day.
Figure 7-11. The Week tab (circled) shows you an overview of what's happening during any given
week.

7.2.3.3. Month view
If you're trying to figure out when you can squeeze in a vacation, Month view (Figure 7-12) can help out. This
view shows an entire month in grid format, just like the kind of calendar you hang on a wall. Multi-day events
(like your vacation) show a bar stretching across the relevant days. You can add an event by clicking any day.
(When you do, Calendar assumes it's a full-day event unless you tell it otherwise by clicking "edit event
details".)
NOTE
If you have more events on a particular day than Month view can display, you see a link that says
something like "+2 more" (if there are two more events than the calendar can show, for example). Click
the link to open a little pop-up window that shows all events for that day.
Figure 7-12. Clicking the Month tab (circled) shows you an entire month's worth of events. If you're
looking at the current month, the calendar highlights today. Events that last a whole day (like a
birthday) appear in a colored bar at the top of a date. Click the bar to see the event's details.

7.2.3.4. Next 4 days view
Click the Next 4 Days tab, shown in Figure 7-13, to see more than today but less than a whole week. The Next 4
Days view is a lot like Week view, but it shows only four days.
Figure 7-13. For a quick peek into the immediate future, click the Next 4 Days tab (circled).

If 4 days ahead isn't the right amount for you, you can customize this view; [click here]
tells you how.
7.2.3.5. Agenda view
Agenda view, shown in Figure 7-14, shifts the emphasis to events, rather than days, showing a list of what
you've got coming up. This view has four columns:
Day of week
Date
Time
Event
To see the details of an event, click its name. Or you can show the details of all events on your agenda by
clicking the upper-left Expand All link.

Figure 7-14. To see a list of what you've got coming up, click the Agenda tab (circled). When you
click an event in the list, the list expands to show the event's details, such as when the event ends.
The upper-left Expand All and Collapse All links (also circled) show or hide the details of all the
events on the list.
7.2.3.6. View an event's details
Whatever view you're in, you can see an event's details by clicking the event. A balloon appears showing the
event's what, where, and when, as you can see in Figure 7-15. Alternatively, you can double-click the event to
open a page like the one in Figure 7-16. Your event's details appear in the upper-left part of the page, in a
green box.
Figure 7-15. Click an event to get a quick look at its essential details. This balloon shows the event's
name, time slot, and location. If you've entered a description of the event, click "edit event details"
to see it.

If you enter an address (or even a venue, such as Luxor Hotel or Harvard University) in
an event's Where field, Google finds that address for you. When you view the event's
details, click the "map" link to its right. This opens Google Maps in a new window,
showing the address. From there, you can click "Get directions" to get door-to-door
directions to your event.
Figure 7-16. When you double-click an event on your calendar, you see a page like this. The upper-
left corner shows the details you've entered for that event.

7.2.4. Editing an Event
Change happens—meetings get moved to a different time or venue, bad weather forces cancellations, a friend
calls to reschedule a lunch date from noon to 1 p.m. When you need to edit an event, display the event in
whatever view you like, and then do one of the following:
Double-click the event's name. This opens a page like the one in Figure 7-16. In the upper-left part of
the page, pass your cursor over the info you want to change. The info's background changes to a text box.
Click the box, and then make your changes.
Click the event to show a balloon with details, and then click "edit event details". This opens a
page similar to the one shown in Figure 7-16, except that all the details of the event appear as editable
fields: text boxes and drop-down lists.
Whichever path you take, click Save when you're done, and Google records your changes.
7.2.5. Inviting Others to an Event
No need to spend lots of money sending out engraved invitations to your next big bash—you can invite people
right from Google Calendar. Any time you create or edit an event, use the Guests section (shown in Figure 7-17)
to create your guest list and send invitations. Choose guests from your Gmail Contacts list ([click here]) by
clicking the "Choose from contacts" link, or, in the text box, type people's email addresses (put a comma
between addresses to separate them).

Figure 7-17. If you don't see a big text box in an event's Guests section, click the + sign (circled) to
expand the section. You can choose guests from your Gmail address book ([click here]), or type or
paste email addresses into the text box.
For each batch of invitations you send out, you have two options:
Guests can invite others. Leave this checkbox turned on if you want to let people you invite send out
more invitations. This works great if you're publicizing an event like a lecture, a concert, or a poetry
reading. If you have in mind something more intimate, like a formal dinner for eight, turn off this
checkbox—or who knows who might show up.
Guests can see guest list. If you want to let your guests see who is (or isn't) attending, leave this
checkbox turned on. If you turn it off, guests who view the event see this message: The guest list has
been hidden at organizer's request.
Click Save, and then confirm you want to send out your invitations, and Google does just that.
NOTE

Guests who don't have a Google Calendar account are invited to create one, or they can use the iCal file
attached to the invitation email to add your event to their calendar programs. (The box on [click here]
tells you more about iCal.)
7.2.5.1. Track responses
When you send out invitations, your guests can respond with a yes, no, or maybe ([click here] gives the details
about responding to an event). As the RSVPs start rolling in, you don't have to do anything special to keep track
of them—Google tracks 'em for you (see Figure 7-18). Just look in an event's Guests section to see who's
coming, who's not, and who hasn't made up their her mind. The section also lists folks who haven't responded
so that, if necessary, you can contact them again.
Figure 7-18. After you've invited guests to an event, Google tracks their responses. In this example,
it's okay for guests to invite other guests, and one person on the Yes list is bringing someone else
along (circled).
7.2.5.2. Email guests
If the details of your event change, then you can email all your guests at once to let them know. Or you might
want to send out a reminder as the big day approaches. To send an email to everyone on your guest list, follow
these steps:
1.

Find the event on your calendar, and then double-click its name.
Calendar shows you the event's details.
1.
In the upper-right part of the Guests section, click the "Email guests" link (you can see it in Figure 7-18).
2.
Google opens the "Send an Email to Guests" box. This box has the Subject line already filled in with the
event's name and the To line prefilled with guests' email addresses. The Message box is blank, waiting for
your message.
3.
In the Message box, type a message. You can edit the Subject and To lines if, for example, you just want
to email the folks who haven't responded yet. If you want a copy of the email, turn on the "Send copy to
myself" checkbox. Then click Send.
Google shoots off an email to everyone in the To field.
4.
7.2.5.3. Respond to an invitation
Everyone likes getting invitations. When you're invited to someone's Google Calendar event, you get an email
like the one in Figure 7-19. To respond to the invitation, click Yes, No, or Maybe. Here's what happens in each
case:
Figure 7-19. Here's what a Google Calendar invitation looks like in Gmail. Google Calendar users can
see what else they've got scheduled for that day, or click a link to go right to their calendars. To
RSVP, click Yes, No, or Maybe (circled).

Yes. When you click this link, Google adds you to the host's Yes list, and adds the event to your primary
calendar (the one Google created for you the first time you signed into Calendar). From there, you can
view the event ([click here]), discuss it with others ([click here]), or change your mind about attending
([click here]).
No. Google records your No response in the host's calendar, and adds the event to your calendar in a pale
font, to show that you're not going. If you change your mind, you can click the grayed-out event, and then
change your response ([click here]). If you're really sure that you're not going and don't want the event
cluttering up your calendar, just delete it ([click here]).
If you don't want any invitations you've declined to appear on your calendar, jump
over to [click here] to learn how to turn them off.
Maybe. Google puts you on the host's Maybe list, and adds the event to your main calendar, marked with

a question mark. When you make up your mind, you can click the event and change your response to Yes
or No (see the next section).
NOTE
Guests who don't use Gmail or Google Calendar receive an invitation that looks similar to the one
in Figure 7-19, but it doesn't contain details about their own calendars. When guests clicks the
email's "more details" link, they can view the event's details, see the guest list (if the host allowed
that), and discuss the event with other participants.
7.2.5.4. Change your response to an invitation
If you have a change of plans (or a change of heart) about an event you've been invited to, it's only common
courtesy to let the host know. To do that, find the event in your calendar, and then double-click it to see its
details. Your response is on the right side of the page and (if the host okayed it) so is the guest list so far, as
you saw back in Figure 7-18. Under your response is a link labeled "Change your response". Click that link to
expand the section, as shown in Figure 7-20, and make your change. It's good manners to include a note letting
your host know why you changed your mind, so type one in the "Add a note" text box. When you're done, click
the "Submit response" button.
Figure 7-20. If you change your mind about attending an event after you've responded, you can
change your response here.

7.2.5.5. Discuss an event
People who've been invited to an event (or who can access the event via a shared calendar [[click here]]) can
talk about the event in advance. You can easily find out if you need to bring anything, find someone to share a
ride with, or just show some enthusiasm.
The event's details page is the place to discuss events. On your calendar, find the event, and then double-click
it. The "Discuss this event" section is at the bottom of the page that opens, as Figure 7-21 shows. Google
displays previous comments in this section. To get in on the conversation, click the + sign next to "Add a
comment". This action expands the section to show a text box where you can have your say. When you're done,
click the "Post comment" button, and Google adds your comment to the top of the list.
Figure 7-21. To chime in about an event, click the + sign next to "Add a comment" (circled) to
display a nice, roomy text box where you can type your comment. Click "Post comment" when you're
done.
7.2.6. Deleting an Event

If an event gets canceled—or you just change your mind about attending—you can delete it from your calendar.
Click the event to bring up the balloon shown back in Figure 7-15. In the balloon, click Delete. Google opens a
confirmation box; click Delete again to remove the event from your calendar.
7.2.6.1. Delete a recurring event
When you delete a repeating event, like a sales meeting on the first Tuesday of every month or a twice-weekly
sports practice, Google gives you a choice of exactly what you want to delete. Click the event and, in the
balloon that appears, click Delete, and then choose from these options:
Only this instance. If you get word, for example, that your book club meeting has been canceled for this
month but will meet next month as usual, click this button.
All events in the series. If, on the other hand, your book club decides to disband, then click this button
to take all scheduled meetings off your calendar.
All following. Maybe your priorities have changed and you don't have time for your book club any more.
Click this button to keep your farewell meeting on the schedule but cancel any subsequent ones.
Cancel. If your finger slipped or you just decide not to delete the event, click this button, and Google
doesn't delete any instances of the event.
NOTE
When you select an option for deleting a recurring event, Google doesn't follow up with a
confirmation box—it deletes the event right away. You can't easily undo an event deletion, so be
sure of your choice before you click.
 

 
7.3. Working with Calendars
After you've mastered the basics—creating a calendar and adding, viewing, and changing its events—there's still
a lot more you can do with Google Calendar. This section explains how to personalize your calendar, share and
search calendars, manage your calendar list, and print out a hard copy of your calendar. Read on to learn more.
7.3.1. Adjusting Your Settings
On the Settings page of your Google Calendar account (click the upper-right Settings link to find it), you tell
Google how you want your account set up. Here, you can change how your calendars look, manage calendars,
or set up Google Calendar to work with your cellphone.
7.3.1.1. The General tab
The General tab, shown in Figure 7-22, is where you tell Google how you want to view calendars and handle
invitations. Here's what's on it:
Figure 7-22. On the Settings page's General tab (circled), you can adjust settings related to how
your calendars look and how to deal with invitations.

Language. This setting controls the language Google uses to display your calendar; take your pick of a
couple dozen different choices.
Country. You choice in this drop-down list determines the time zones Google displays in the next menu.
Choose a different country (or turn on the "Display all timezones" checkbox) to change your options.
Your current time zone. Changing your time zone as you travel can help you make sure you never miss
an appointment. From this drop-down list, pick the time zone you're in now.
Date format. Google offers you three different formats for displaying dates. You can display the date
(October 31, 2008, for example) with the month first (10/31/2008), the day first (31/10/2008), or the
year first (2008-10-31).
Time format. Choose between the 12-hour clock (5:00 p.m.) and the 24-hour clock (17:00).
Week starts on. This option sets the day your calendar shows as the first day each week. Your choices
are Sunday, Monday, and Saturday.
Show weekends. If you use Google Calendar only to track work-related events and you never work on
weekends, then turn on the No radio button in this section to show only Monday through Friday on your
calendar.
Default view. This setting controls the view ([click here]) you see when you first open Google Calendar
or create a new calendar ([click here]). Your choices are the same as the tabs above calendars: Day,
Week, Month, Custom View (preset to Next 4 Days unless you change it), and Agenda.
Custom view. Google lets you set one tab to the view that works best for you. When you first start using
Google Calendar, the custom view tab is set to Next 4 Days, but you can change it to a view that works
better for you by selecting from this drop-down list. Choices range from Next 2 Days to Next 4 Weeks.
Show current time. If you turn on the Yes radio button, Google adds a thin red line to the current date
on your calendar to show what time it is. For example, if it's 5:30 in the evening, you see the line halfway
between 5 p.m. and 6 p.m. in today's box. This can help you keep track of the amount of time you have
before an event.
NOTE
The current time doesn't display in Month or Agenda views.
Location. If you want to see a weather forecast on your calendar (see next item), you need to tell Google

where you are. Type in a city and state, a Zip code, or a city and country.
Show weather based on my location. If you're planning an outdoor event, like a neighborhood
barbecue or a cross-country ski meet, you want to know a few days in advance if the weather is likely to
cooperate. Similarly, if you're planning a trip, knowing the weather forecast for your destination helps you
pack. Turn on the °C or °F radio button to add a weather report to your calendar (based on the location
you chose in the previous setting). On your calendar, Google adds a weather-forecast icon to today and
the next 3 days, as Figure 7-23 shows. Click an icon to see a more detailed forecast.
Figure 7-23. On the Settings page's General tab, give Google a location, and then turn on the °C or °F
radio button to show a weather forecast on your calendar.
Show events you have declined. This option is automatically set to Yes, so that when you turn down an
invitation to an event, Google adds it to your calendar in pale text to distinguish it from active events.
(That way, if you change your mind, it's easy to change your response [[click here]]). But if you don't
want events you've said "No, thanks" to cluttering up your calendar, turn on the No radio button here.
Automatically add invitations to my calendar. If you want Google to put events you're invited to on
your calendar, leave this section set to Yes. If you'd rather keep events off your calendar until you've
decided whether or not you're going, turn on "No, only show invitations to which I have responded".

There are some annoying spammers out there who may try to send you junk mail
in the form of calendar invitations. To keep these spam invitations out of your
calendar, turn off the "Automatically add invitations" setting.
Google Account settings. Click the link in this section to open a new window displaying your personal
Google Account page ([click here] explains what you can do on this page).
If you make any changes to the settings on this tab, be sure to click the Save button at the bottom to make 'em
stick.
7.3.1.2. The Calendars tab
The Calendars tab of the Settings page, shown in Figure 7-24, is where you create a new calendar ([click here])
or manage existing ones ([click here]). To get there, click Settings
Calendars or, in the left-hand menu
below your My Calendars list, click the "Manage calendars" link. Here's what you can do on this tab:
Figure 7-24. The Settings page's Calendars tab (circled) is command central for working with your
calendars.
My Calendars. The calendars in this section are your primary calendar (the calendar that Google created

the first time you used Calendar), any other calendars you've created, and any shared calendars you can
edit.
Create new calendar. Click this button to create a brand-new calendar ([click here]) and add it to your
list.
View or change a calendar's details. Click any calendar's name to manage that calendar by changing
its name, giving it a location, embedding it in a Web page, and more ([click here] gives you all the details
about managing calendars).
Share this calendar. You can share calendars you've created with a specific group of people or with the
general public. Click this link to get started, and then flip to [click here] for step-by-step instructions.
Notifications. Click this link to set up notifications ([click here]) for a particular calendar on your list.
Hide. Click this link to hide a secondary calendar's events from your primary calendar ([click here]) and
also from your My Calendars list. (You can't hide your primary calendar.)
Delete. Are you done with a particular calendar? On the far right, click its trash can to remove it from
your Google Calendar account.
Other calendars. This section displays any shared calendars that you can view but not edit. Click a
calendar's name to view its details.
Add calendar. Click this button to search or browse public calendars, which you can add to your calendar
list; [click here] tells you more.
7.3.1.3. The Mobile Setup tab
One of the great things about Google Calendar is that you can get notifications, take a look at your calendar,
and add and view events using your cellphone. On [click here], you can learn all the things you can do when you
go mobile with Google Calendar, but before you can get on-the-go reminders from Calendar, you need to set up
your cellphone or other mobile device on the Settings page's Mobile Setup tab, shown in Figure 7-25. Here's
how:
Open Google Calendar, and then select Settings
Mobile Setup.
The Settings page opens to the Mobile Setup tab (Figure 7-25).
1.
Figure 7-25. Click Settings
Mobile Setup to add a cellphone number to Google Calendar or change
an existing number.

Select a country, type in your cellphone number, and choose your cellphone carrier from the drop-down
list. Then click Send Verification Code.
0.
Google sends a verification code by text message to your cellphone or mobile device. At the same time, it
displays a box on your computer's screen telling you to watch for this message.
1.
When the text message arrives on your phone, read it and find the verification code. Back on your
computer, click OK to close the notification box, type the code you received into the "Verification code"
text box, and then click "Finish setup".
Google validates the code and sets up your account for mobile access. Now you can skip to [click here] to
learn how to use Google Calendar on your mobile device.
2.
After you've set your phone, the Mobile Setup tab's Status section changes to say, "Phone number successfully
validated". In the future, if you need to change your cellphone or mobile device number, come back here and
repeat the steps in this section.
NOTE
Google Calendar supports phone carriers from all over the world. The carriers that appear in the "Phone
carrier" drop-down list depend on the country you choose. If you pick a country and the "Phone carrier"
section changes to See Help Center for supported providers, then you can click the link to see whether
your company is on the list. If it is, you don't have to change anything on the Settings
Mobile Setup
tab. Just enter your number, click Send Verification Code, and then submit the code you receive.

7.3.2. Sharing Calendars
When somebody says, "Let's do lunch," it would be helpful to have access to each other's calendars. In fact,
there are lots of reasons you might want to share a calendar: to coordinate schedules with your spouse, to
make it easy to set up meetings with your colleagues, to keep track of your kids' after-school activities, or to
publicize events. Google gives you a whole bunch of ways to share a calendar: You can share with a specific
group, make your calendar available to the public, put it on your Web site, or let others subscribe to it. This
section discusses all those options, so you can choose the one that's right for you. (Or maybe you'll decide to
keep your calendar all to yourself—this section tells you how to do that, too.)
NOTE
Calendars you create are private unless you choose to share them.
7.3.2.1. Share a calendar with a specific group
To share your calendar with other Google Calendar users, take these simple steps:
In the left-hand My Calendars list, find the calendar you want to share, click its drop-down arrow, and
then select "Share this calendar". Or you can click the "Manage calendars" link, find the calendar you
want, and then click its "Share this calendar" link.
Either way, Google opens the calendar's Details page, with the "Share this calendar" tab selected, as
shown in Figure 7-26. The middle section of this tab, labeled "Share with specific people", shows info
about who can currently see or work with your calendar.
1.
Figure 7-26. Whether you're sharing a calendar with everyone or just a select few, on the calendar's
details page, use the "Share this calendar" tab (circled) to control who can see your calendar.

In the Person text box, type the email address of the person with whom you want to share. Choose a
Permission Setting, and then click Add Person. Google offers these permission settings:
Make changes AND manage sharing. This setting effectively gives the people you're sharing with
the same privileges that you have as owner of the calendar. They can add or edit events, invite
others to see the calendar, even delete the calendar.
NOTE
You can't delete a primary calendar—yours or anyone else's.
Make changes to events. People with this permission level can add, edit, and delete events in the
calendar but can't share the calendar with anyone else or delete it (but they can remove it from their
own calendar lists).
See all event details. This setting lets people see an event's details and add the event to their own
calendars, but they can't change or delete an event on the shared calendar. If you don't choose
another permission level, Google automatically uses this setting.
See only free/busy (hide details). When you select this option, people can see that you've got
some time blocked off, but not the details of the event. This option's helpful when you need to share
a calendar with coworkers but don't want them to know that the reason you're busy on Tuesday at
4:00 is a job interview elsewhere.
When you've made your selection, Google adds that person to the list of folks who can share this calendar,
under your name. You can come back to this list at any time to adjust their permissions or remove them
from the list (see the next section). Click Save when you're done.
0.

If you want to share with more people, simply repeat this process.
NOTE
You can share a calendar with up to 75 other people per day. If your list of sharers is longer than that,
wait 24 hours and repeat the process. Or consider making your calendar public ([click here]).
7.3.2.2. Change or remove someone's sharing privileges
Maybe you'll regret your decision to share a calendar with someone. For example, say you're sick of the
coworker who always corrects your spelling, and you want to reset her privileges so she can see your events but
not edit them. Or maybe someone has left the company and you don't want him snooping on your schedule. To
change or remove someone's sharing privileges, in the left-hand My Calendars list, first find the calendar you
want, and then click its drop-down arrow. From the list that appears, choose "Share this calendar" to get to the
calendar's Details page's "Share this calendar" tab.
There, look in the "Share with specific people" section and find the person you want. To change his sharing
privileges, click the drop-down list next to his name, and then, from the list, select the new permission level. Or
to stop sharing with him altogether, click the far-right trash can for him.
Click Save, and Google makes your change.
If you can't see the far-right trash can, your browser's text-size setting may be too big.
In IE or Firefox, click View
"Text size", and then make the text smaller.
7.3.2.3. Make your calendar public
Making a calendar public is a great way to share info with anyone who needs it. When a calendar's public,
anyone can search it, view its events, and add those events to their own calendars. For example, a school
administrator can share the school calendar with the community: exam dates, parents' nights, home and away
games for sports teams—anything that people might need to know about what's going on in school. Similarly,
any organization that holds public events can share its schedule with the world.
Google makes a calendar public by publishing it on the Web, where anyone who has its address can view it.
They can add the calendar to their calendar lists ([click here]) or put individual events on their own calendars.
In addition, people can find your calendar's events through a Google search.
Making a calendar public is simple. In your Calendar's list, find the calendar you want, click its drop-down arrow,
and then select "Share this calendar". Alternatively, look below your My Calendars list for the "Manage
calendars" link, click it, find the calendar you want, and then click "Share this calendar" (or, if you've already
shared the calendar, the menu item you want is "Shared: Edit settings"). Either way, Google opens the
calendar's Share tab, shown in Figure 7-26.

At the top of the Share tab, turn on the "Make this calendar public" checkbox. If you want your calendar to show
just those blocks of time when you're busy or free, without giving event details, turn on the checkbox labeled
"Show only my free/busy information (Hide details)". Click Save, and Google publishes your calendar online.
NOTE
Public calendars that have the "Show only my free/busy information (Hide details)" checkbox turned on
don't appear in Google or Google Calendar searches. You have to share the nitty-gritty details of your
calendar if you want people to be able to search for it.
Now that you've made your calendar public, you want to let people know where to find it. Here's how:
In your My Calendars list, find the public calendar, click its dropdown arrow, and then select "Calendar
settings".
The Details page for that calendar opens, showing the Calendar Details tab.
1.
Scroll down to the "Calendar address" section, and then click the HTML button.
A box pops up, containing a URL.
2.
Copy this address, and then share it with people who don't have a Google Calendar account.
From the page that displays your public calendar, viewers can subscribe to an RSS feed to keep updated
about new events. (For more about RSS feeds, see [click here].)
The URL for your calendar is kind of big and unwieldy. You can make it easier for
others to find your calendar by displaying the calendar on your iGoogle page or
even your own Web site, if you have one—see [click here] for details.
3.
7.3.2.4. Make a public calendar private
If you want to stop sharing a public calendar, go back to that calendar's Share tab (find the calendar in your My
Calendars list, click its drop-down arrow, and then select "Share this calendar"). Turn off the "Make this
calendar public" checkbox, and then click Save. Your calendar is now back to being private.
If you want to hide just some of the events on a public calendar, leaving the rest of the
calendar public, you can make individual events private—[click here] explains how.

7.3.2.5. Put a calendar on your Web site
A convenient way to share a calendar is to publish a "live," continuously updated version right on your Web site
or blog. For example, imagine you work for a financial services company that offers frequent seminars on a
variety of topics. If you put a calendar of these seminars on your company's Web site, people who visit the site
can view the seminar schedule. And people who use Google Calendar can add a seminar to their own calendar
with a single click.
To add your calendar to a Web site:
In your My Calendars list, find the calendar you want to put on your Web site, and then click the drop-
down arrow next to its name. From the menu that appears, choose "Calendar settings".
The Calendar Details page opens.
1.
Scroll down to the "Embed this Calendar" section. If you want to customize your calendar, click the
"Customize the color, size, and other options" link. (If you don't want to customize, skip to step 4.)
A new window opens, showing the aptly named Google Embeddable Calendar Helper (shown in Figure 7-
27). Here's what you can tweak:
Calendar Title. You can give your calendar a catchy name to attract people's attention. This title
appears at the top of the calendar and in people's search results.
Show. Turn these checkboxes on or off to show or hide various elements: the title, navigation
buttons (for moving to different dates), date, tabs (for showing different views), and calendar list.
Figure 7-27. Here's where you can customize your calendar before publishing it on your
Web site or blog.
2.

Default view. Your choices are Week, Month, or Agenda view.
Width/height. If you need to make the embedded calendar bigger or more compact, adjust its
pixels here. (In case you play around with these numbers and want to go back to the original
settings later, they're 800 for width and 600 for height.)
Week starts on. Choose Sunday, Monday, or Saturday.
Language. If you want your calendar displayed in a language other than the one you use for your
calendars, choose a language from this drop-down list. This setting changes the language Google
uses to display Calendar, but it doesn't change the details of your events.
Background color. Click this box if you want to select a background color for the calendar's title
bar.
Border? Turn on this checkbox to put a border around the entire embedded calendar.
Calendars to Display. If you want to embed more than one calendar, select additional ones by
turning on their checkboxes here.
Time Zone. The calendar is automatically set to the same time zone as your Google Calendar
account, but if you want, you can change the time zone here.

As you play around with the settings, Google adjusts the preview on the right to reflect your choices.
When your calendar looks the way you want it to appear on your Web site, click the Update HTML button.
Google generates the HTML code you need to put the calendar on your Web site.
3.
Copy the HTML, and then paste it into the HTML of the Web page to which you want to add it.
Your calendar appears on your Web site for all to see.
4.
7.3.3. Searching Calendars
Google Calendar is a handy way to find events going on in your area—or even just the events on your own
calendars. You can most easily find an event by typing your search terms in the box at the top of the page, and
then clicking either Search Public Calendars or Search My Calendars. Google conducts your search and displays
the results.
7.3.3.1. Advanced search options for your personal calendars
Have you ever drawn a blank about the details of an event? Maybe you remember you've got a lunch date but
forgot whom you invited and where you're meeting. Or maybe you know you're doing something with your
friend Julie sometime soon, but don't remember what or whether you settled on a day. Luckily, Google Calendar
can come to your rescue. To find a particular event (past or future) in one of your calendars, use advanced
search options so Google can help you dig up the details.
To get to the advanced options, to the right of the two search buttons at the top of the page, click the Show
Search Options link. This displays the choices you see in Figure 7-28:
What. Type a keyword here, and Google searches events' titles, descriptions, guest lists, and every other
detail.
Doesn't have. If there's a word or phrase you want to exclude, enter it here.
Who. When you type a name in here, Google searches the guest lists of your events.
Where. If you added a location to the event, then Google can search for that location.
You can also use the info in this box to map an event's location on Google Maps.
The Tip on [click here] tells you how.
Figure 7-28. When you search the calendars in your account, you can narrow the search by telling
Google what to search for and where.

Search. Use this drop-down list to limit the search to a particular calendar in your account.
Date from/to. These fields let you search a specific period of time.
NOTE
When you're searching your personal calendars, use the exact word you want. Partial search terms
don't work. For example, if you're looking for your daughter's piano lesson, searching for les
(instead of lesson) doesn't bring up any results.
When you've filled in your search terms, click Search. Google displays the results just below the search options.
(Google creates a new tab to display the search results.)
7.3.3.2. Search public calendars and add them to your account
When you type in a search term and click the Search Public Calendars button, Google searches all the calendars
that people have made public ([click here]), and then displays the results in a list like the one shown in Figure
7-29; you can click a calendar to display it. Google opens the calendar in a new window.
Figure 7-29. In this example, someone searched public calendars for art-related events in Boston,
and Google returned these results. Click a calendar's name to open the calendar, view its events, and
add its event to your calendar. (Click the "Add to Calendar" button below a calendar's name to add
the whole calendar to your account.) You can browse public calendar categories using the links on
the left. For example, the Holidays category lists different countries' public holidays, as well as
different religions' holidays.

If you see an event you want to add to your calendar, click the event to see its details, and then select "Add to
Calendar". Google opens the event in your calendar's Create an Event page (like the one shown back in Figure
7-4). Click Save Changes to add the event. To close the public calendar you were looking at, click its OK button
at the bottom of the window.
If there's a public calendar in your search results list that you want to add to your own calendar list, click its
"Add to Calendars" button. Google imports the calendar, and all its events, into your account.
You can also browse public calendars. Above your My Calendars list, click Add
"Add a
public calendar", or select Settings
Calendars
"Add calendar". You can even click
Search Public Calendars, leaving the search box empty. However you get there, you
arrive at Google's public calendar gallery. Use the gallery's left-hand categories to find
and browse public calendars.
7.3.4. Managing Your Calendar List
As you calendar list grows—whether because of ones you create, share, or add to your account from the public
gallery—you'll probably want to manage those calendars. This section helps you do just that.
7.3.4.1. Add a friend's calendar

What are your friends up to these days? It's easy enough to find out. If a friend, colleague, or family member
uses Google Calendar, you can add any calendars they've made public to your account. Click the Add button
above your My Calendars list, and then select "Add a friend's calendar". On the page that opens, you see a text
box where you can enter your friend's email address. Type it in, and then click Add. When you do, one of these
things happens:
If your friend's calendar is public or you're on your friend's list of people who can share, Google adds the
calendar to your list.
If your friend's calendar isn't public or you're not on its shared list, Google informs you that you don't have
access—yet. If you want, Google will send a request to your friend to share the calendar with you. You can
add a personal message to Google's generic one, if you want, and then click Send Request.
If your friend doesn't have a Google Calendar account, Google tells you, and gives you the option of
sending him an email invitation to try Google Calendar. (You can customize the message if you like.) Click
Send Invite to ask your friend to try Google Calendar.
7.3.4.2. Add a calendar by URL
If you know a calendar's address on the Web (say someone sent it to you after publishing it online—see [click
here]), then you can add it to your Google Calendar account. To add it, at the top of your calendar list, click Add
"Add by URL". Google opens the Add Other Calendar page, with the "Add by URL" tab selected. Type (or
paste) the Web address of the calendar you want to add. Turn on the checkbox if you want the calendar to be
searchable in Google Calendar search, and then click Add. Google adds the calendar to your account.
7.3.4.3. Change a calendar's color
When you add a new calendar to your left-hand My Calendars list, Google assigns it a color that none of your
other calendars is using. This color coding helps you keep different calendars and their events straight. For
example, you can make events on your main calendar red, your daughter's basketball calendar navy, your
spouse's schedule yellow, and your co-workers' a whole rainbow. The left-hand My Calendars list shows which
events go with which color. Figure 7-30 shows what things look like as you add events from different calendars
to your own.
Figure 7-30. As you add new calendars and their events, Google uses color coding to make it clear
which event comes from which calendar. Colors in the My Calendars list (circled) correspond to
events in the main calendar.

If you have a hard time telling two calendars apart, you can change the color of one of them so it's easier to see
which event goes with which calendar. To change a calendar's color, find it in the Calendar's list, and then click
its drop-down arrow. A menu with a palette of 21 colors appears. Click the one you want, and Google changes
the color.
7.3.4.4. Rename a calendar
To make sure you can tell your calendars apart, give each one a clear, descriptive name. To rename any entry
on your calendar list, click its drop-down arrow, and then select "Calendar settings". Google opens the relevant
Details page, with the Calendar Details tab selected. Click the Calendar Name box to clear the current name and
enter a new one. When done, click Save.
When you come back to the Calendar Details tab of a renamed calendar, Google displays both the current name
and, beneath that, the original one. So if it's a shared calendar and someone refers to it by its old name, you
won't get confused.
7.3.4.5. Hide a calendar
Sometimes a minimalist approach is best. If your calendar is so filled up that you get tired just looking at it, it
might be helpful to hide some of the calendars, so you can focus on the important stuff. Hidden calendars
disappear from your My Calendars list and its events disappear from your main calendar, giving you a little
breathing space.
Start by clicking the "Manage calendars" link. (If you prefer the scenic route, click Settings
Calendars.) The
Calendars Settings page opens with the Calendars tab selected, as in Figure 7-31.

Figure 7-31. To hide a calendar or show a hidden one, click the appropriate link. To get rid of a
calendar altogether, click its far-right trash can.
For any calendars you want to hide, click Hide. Hidden calendars aren't gone—just hidden. (The next section
tells you how to delete calendars.) To make a hidden calendar reappear, click "Manage calendars", and then
click the calendar's Show link.
7.3.4.6. Delete a calendar
When your calendar reminds you that it's time for spring cleaning, you might find yourself in the mood to weed
out a few old calendars from your account. Start on the Google Calendar home page. Click "Manage calendars"
to get to the page shown in Figure 7-30. Find the calendar you want to delete, and then look to its far right for a
little picture of a trash can. Click the trash can, and Google pops up a confirmation box.
If you have owner-level privileges (meaning you can share the calendar and change its events), you have a
choice of removing it from your list or deleting it. Choose Remove if you share the calendar with others and still
want them to have access to it, or Delete if you want to get rid of it completely.
NOTE
If you don't have owner-level privileges, your only choice is to remove the calendar from your account.
7.3.5. Printing a Calendar

It won't have Impressionist artwork or pictures of cute puppies for you to adorn your walls, but you can print
out a Google Calendar if you need to have it handy when you're not near a computer. Just follow these steps:
Figure 7-32. Before you print a calendar, check out how it'll look on the page. Adjust the font size,
orientation, or ink color, if you want. (You can also choose to show or hide events you've been
invited to but won't attend.) Click Print to export the calendar as a PDF, so you can print it.
In your My Calendars list, select the one you want to print by turning on its checkbox. If you want to print
a different view from the one showing now (Month instead of Week, for example), then click the
1.

appropriate tab. Then, to the left of the view tabs, click the Print link.
Google opens a print preview box like the one in Figure 7-32.
Take a look at the calendar and, if you want, adjust its settings. You can tweak the font size, decide
whether to show events you've declined, and tell Google whether to print in black and white. When you're
happy with the settings, click Print.
Google converts the calendar to a PDF. Your browser opens a window asking how you want to handle the
file.
2.
Open the file in Adobe Reader. Go to File
Print, and then click OK.
The Reader sends the file to your printer.
To download the latest free copy of Adobe Reader, go to www.adobe.com.

7.4. Using Google Calendar with Other Calendar Programs
Google Calendar may be the only calendar you'll ever need, or you might decide you want it to work alongside
another calendar program. No problem (for most people at least; read on). You can import and export events
between Google and most other calendars. This section explains all.
Up to Speed: CSV and iCal
When you're importing and exporting calendar information, you've got two options for how you
pack up that data before you move it:
CSV stands for "comma-separated values." A CSV file is a text file in which pieces of
information are marked off by commas. This format's common for importing and exporting
spreadsheet data. When you're exporting and importing calendar data, this format tells the
calendar program which pieces of information go where. Google Calendar can import CSV
files.
iCal, sometimes called iCalendar, is a special format designed to make it easy to exchange
info between calendar programs. iCal lets you send events via email. When the recipient
clicks the attached iCal file, he can automatically add the event to his own calendar. (This is
a great way to invite people who don't use Google Calendar to an event.) As [click here]
explains, when you export an event from Google Calendar, you do so in iCal format. That
way, you can easily transfer events from Google Calendar to a calendar like Apple iCal,
Microsoft Outlook, Lotus Notes Calendar and Scheduling, or Mozilla Sunbird.
7.4.1. Import Other Programs' Calendars into Google
Before you can import data into Google Calendar, you first need to export the data from your other calendar
program (the sections that follow give specific instructions for different programs). When you've exported your
data to a file, here's how to import that file's data into Google Calendar:
Figure 7-33. Importing calendar data into your Google Calendar account takes three steps: Locate
the file, select the calendar you're adding the info to, and then click Import.

At the top of your My Calendars list, click Add
Import Calendar.
The Add Other Calendar page opens to the Import Calendar tab, shown in Figure 7-33.
1.
Click Browse. Find and select the other calendar's data file you just saved, and then click Open.
The file appears in the Select File box.
2.
Click the Choose Calendar drop-down list, and then select the Google calendar you want to import to.
Then click Import.
Google imports the file, adding its events to the calendar you chose.
If you're importing more than a year's worth of data, it's a good idea to split that
big calendar up into smaller, 1-year segments, and then export each file
separately. If you try to import one huge file, you're likely to run into some errors.
Using smaller bites works better.
3.
7.4.1.1. Apple iCal Calendar
To move events from your Apple's iCal program into Google:
Open iCal, and then, from the list in the iCal window, choose the calendar you want. Then select File
1.

Export.
A box opens.
Name and save your calendar.
Your calendar is now ready to import into Google. Hop over to Google Calendar, and then follow the steps
for importing a calendar in the first part of this section.
2.
7.4.1.2. Microsoft Outlook Calendar
If you use Outlook Calendar, follow these steps:
Open Outlook. Select File
Import and Export.
The Import and Export Wizard opens.
1.
Select "Export to a file", and then click Next.
Outlook asks how you want to save the file.
2.
Choose Comma Separated Values (Windows), and then click Next.
Outlook asks which folder you want to export from.
3.
Select Calendar and, if necessary, choose the particular file. Then click Next.
Outlook asks what you want to name the file and where you want to save it.
4.
Give the file a name, and then click the Browse button to tell Outlook where to store the file on your
computer.
Outlook confirms that it's going to export the file.
5.
Click Finish.
Despite the name of the button you just clicked, you're not quite finished. Outlook opens a new box,
asking you to select the range of dates whose events you want to export.
6.
Make sure the dates look good, and then click OK.
Outlook exports your selection and saves it to your computer. Now you can go to Google Calendar and
import that file ([click here]).
7.

Even easier than exporting, you can now sync Google Calendar and Microsoft
Outlook Calendar. See [click here] to find out how.
7.4.1.3. Yahoo Calendar
If you use Yahoo Calendar, you can easily export events from that program. Here's how:
Open Yahoo Calendar, and then select Options
Import/Export.
Yahoo's Import/Export page opens.
1.
Scroll down to the "Export to Outlook" section, and then click the Export button.
Yahoo converts your calendar data into a CSV file ([click here]). A box opens, asking how you want to deal
with the file: Open it or save it to your computer.
2.
Save the CSV file to your computer.
Your computer downloads the file.
3.
Now you can follow the steps listed earlier in this section to import the CSV file into Google Calendar.
NOTE
When you export from Outlook Calendar or Yahoo Calendar, the exported file doesn't support recurring
events. Instead, recurring events get treated as individual events within the date range you select.
7.4.1.4. Other Calendars
If you use a calendar program other than the ones just listed, follow your program's instructions for exporting.
Save the exported file in either ICAL or CSV format. After you've done that, import ([click here]) the file into
Google Calendar.
7.4.2. Export Google Calendar Events
To get info about your schedule out of Google Calendar and into another calendar program, follow these steps:
On the Google Calendar home page, in your My Calendars list, find the calendar you want, and then click
its down arrow. From the menu that appears, select "Calendar settings".
1.

Google opens the Details page for that calendar, with the Calendar Details tab selected.
Scroll down to the Private Address section, and then click its green ICAL button.
The Calendar Address box opens, displaying a URL and this message: "Please use the following address to
access your calendar from other applications. You can copy and paste this into any calendar product that
supports the iCal format." Click the URL to download the iCalendar file.
2.
Your browser opens a box that asks how you want to handle the iCalendar file. You can either open it with
a calendar program or save it to your computer.
If you choose to open the file, you're all set—the events hop straight into your other calendar program,
ready for you to view there. If you choose to save it, then you can open it later using your calendar
program (follow your program's instructions for importing an iCal file).
NOTE
You may see a Feed Processing Error message when you try to export events. If you get this
message, you're probably not using the calendar's private iCal address. Check to make sure you
got the address from the Private Address section of the Details page, and then try again.
3.
7.4.3. Export a Calendar as a PDF
If you want a snapshot of your calendar as it exists right now, you can export it as a PDF. This way, you can
easily create a copy of your calendar that you can email to coworkers or post on the door of your refrigerator.
The process is almost identical to printing a calendar ([click here]). Start out with step 1, as if you're going to
print the calendar. In step 2, instead of clicking Print, click Save As. When your browser opens a box asking how
you want to handle the file, save it to your computer. Google downloads the PDF to your computer. From there,
you can view, print, or email it.
7.4.4. Synching with Microsoft Outlook Calendar
As easy as it is to move information between Google Calendar and Microsoft Outlook Calendar by importing and
exporting, it would be even better if you could keep the two calendars in sync, so when you update one
calendar, the other gets updated automatically. Congratulations Outlook users—your life just got easier! You
can now sync these two programs. (Sorry, Mac fans: Google Calendar Calendar Sync works only on PCs.)
NOTE
At this writing, you can sync only your primary Google calendar ([click here]) with your primary Outlook
calendar; secondary calendars don't sync.

To get Google and Outlook calendars in sync, you need to download a program called Google Calendar Sync.
Just follow these steps:
Point your Web browser to http://dl.google.com/googlecalendarsync/GoogleCalendarSync_Installer.exe.
(That's a lot of typing. Here's a shortcut: http://tinyurl.com/22yq2m.)
Your browser opens a confirmation box.
1.
Click Save File.
Your computer downloads GoogleCalendarSybc_Installer.exe.
2.
Open the file you just downloaded to launch the installer.
A box opens, showing you the license agreement. Read the terms, and then click I Agree.
3.
The installer asks which components you want to install: Google Calendar Sync (you definitely want to
install this), and shortcuts for the Desktop and Start menu (these are optional). Make your selections, and
then click Next.
Next, the installer asks where to install the program.
4.
Accept its suggested location or browse to another location, and then click Install.
A box like the one shown in Figure 7-34 appears.
Figure 7-34. To set up synching between Google Calendar and Microsoft Outlook
Calendar, tell Google how you want to sync (between both programs [2-way] or just
from one to the other) and how often.
5.

In the text boxes, type in the user name and password you use for your Google Account (the ones you use
to sign into Google Calendar). Then select your sync options: whether you want synching to work both
ways or just one (for example, you might just want to update Outlook with information from Google
Calendar, and not the other way around), and how often you want the synching to happen (every 2 hours
is the default; every 10 minutes is the shortest interval Calendar Sync allows). When you've made all
those decisions, click Save.
Google Calendar Sync puts your two calendar programs in sync.
6.
7.4.4.1. Work with Google Calendar Sync
After you've installed Google Calendar Sync on your computer, in the lower-right part of your screen, a calendar
icon appears in your Windows System Tray ([click here]). When you right-click this icon, a menu appears,
offering these options:
Sync. This option initiates a sync right now.

Stop sync. If a sync is happening now and you want to stop it, select this option.
Options. Clicking Options opens the box shown in Figure 7-34, so you can adjust these settings:
Choose 2-way or 1-way synching.
Reset the interval between automatic syncs.
Exit. Close Google Calendar Sync for now. This means there won't be any automatic syncing until you
start Google Calendar Sync again.
 

 
7.5. Google Calendar on the Go
If you're like most people, you're not just sitting in front of the computer all day—you have places to go, things
to do, people to see. Whether you're on the road or just running around town, you can take Google Calendar
with you. All you need is a relatively modern and full-featured cellphone or other mini mobile computer (like a
PDA). If your device meets Google's requirements (see the box on [click here]), you can access your calendar
and receive event notifications on the go. To get those super-helpful reminders sent straight to your cellphone,
just verify your device with Google ([click here]), and read all about mobile Google Calendar in this section.
NOTE
From Google's side of things, using Google Calendar on your cellphone is free; Google doesn't charge
you anything to access your calendar from a mobile device. However, depending on your service plan,
your cellphone carrier may charge for Internet access and text messages. If you're not sure of your
plan's details, check with your carrier.
Frequently Asked Question: Does Your Cellphone Make the Cut?
What are the requirements for accessing Google Calendar on my cellphone?
Before you try to access Google Calendar with your cellphone or other mobile device, make sure
you're set up for success:
Your device's Web browser must work with XHTML. If you don't know, try going to this Web
site and doing a search: http://www.google.com/xhtml. If the search doesn't work, your
phone's browser may not work with XHTML.
Your device's network must allow cookies ([click here]) and secure SSL ([click here]) traffic.
If you're not sure whether your network allows these, contact your carrier and ask.
Make sure cookies are turned on in your device's Web browser (look in browser settings, and
then turn cookies on if necessary).
You also need to set up your phone with Google before you can use it for on-the-go access.
In Google Calendar, go to Settings
Mobile Setup to verify your phone with Google ([click
here] gives step-by-step directions).
7.5.1. Connect to Google Calendar via Your Cellphone
You can access Google Calendar by launching your cellphone's Web browser and pointing it to
www.google.com/calendar. Once there, sign in to see your events.

When you view Google Calendar on your cellphone, you see your events in Agenda view ([click here]). (If you've
got an Apple iPhone, you can also view your calendar in Month view.) When you go mobile, you see a maximum
of 10 events per page.
7.5.1.1. Add an event
To add an event via your cellphone or mobile device, use Quick Add. It works just like Quick Add when you
access Google Calendar from your computer ([click here]). For example, type in the essential info about your
event, like Dr. appointment Monday 2 pm or 3/24 Sales meeting in conference room C-11. Google interprets
what you wrote, and adds it to your calendar.
For tips on using Quick Add efficiently (so you won't have to edit event details later), flip
back to [click here].
7.5.1.2. Receive notifications via text message
After you've verified your cellphone with Google ([click here]), you can set up your account to send text
message notifications to your cellphone. To do that, open Google Calendar on your computer, and, in your My
Calendars list, find the calendar you want, click its drop-down arrow, and then select Notifications. (Or you can
click Settings
Calendars, find the calendar you want, and then click Notifications.)
On the calendar's Details page's Notifications tab (shown back in Figure 7-8), you see a column labeled SMS,
which stands for "short message service" and is just another way of saying "text messaging." In the SMS
column, turn on the checkboxes for any notifications you want to receive as text messages (choose from
reminders, invitation-related notifications, and your complete agenda). Click Save, and you start getting those
notifications on your cellphone.
7.5.1.3. Check your calendar and add events via GVENT
Google has set things up so that you can send a command via text message to check your calendar or add a
new event to it. You do that by sending a text command to GVENT (think "Google event")—that's 48368 if
you're good at remembering numbers.
Before you try interacting with your calendar by sending a text message to GVENT, though, you need to be
aware of two things:
Currently, texting to GVENT works only in the U.S. and only with these service providers:
Alltel
AT&T
Cellular One
Cincinnati Bell

Dobson Communications
Nextel
Qwest
Sprint
T-Mobile
US Cellular
Verizon
Virgin
You can get info for events that are happening within the next 24 hours, but not further into the future.
To check your calendar, send one of these commands to GVENT:
For the next event on your calendar: next.
For all of today's event: day.
For all of tomorrow's events (up to 24 hours away): nday.
To add an event, send a text message worded the same way you'd word Quick Add ([click here]) text, such as
Dentist 4/3 8:30 or Garden tour Saturday noon-4p.
7.5.1.4. Sync Google Calendar with your BlackBerry
Here's some good news for BlackBerry users: You can sync your BlackBerry's built-in calendar with Google
Calendar. Google Sync provides easy integration of your BlackBerry and your Google Calendar account, so you
can leave your laptop at home, and use your BlackBerry to view your calendar and work with its events.
Here's how to download and install Google Sync on your Blackberry:
1

On your BlackBerry, point your browser to http://m.google.com/sync.
A page opens, with a link that says Download Google Sync.
1.
Click your BlackBerry's jog wheel or menu button, and then select "Get link".
A download page opens.
2.
Click Download.
Your BlackBerry downloads the Google Sync installation program. When it's done, it starts installing
Google Sync right away.
3.
After you've got Google Sync on your BlackBerry, you can see the Google Sync icon (which looks like a calendar
page) on your home screen. Now you're ready to start synching:
On your BlackBerry's home screen, click the Google Sync icon.
A sign-in screen opens.
1.
Sign in, using your Google Account's full email address and password, and then press Login.
Google Sync signs into your Google Calendar account.
2.
At the bottom of the welcome screen is a Sync Now button; click it.
Google Sync synchronizes your Google and BlackBerry calendars. If you've got a lot of events in your
Google calendar, this process can take a few minutes.
3.
From now on, any events you add to either one of your calendars show up on both.
 

 
7.6. Calendar Tricks for Google Apps Users
If you signed up for a Google Account on your own, you can skip this section. But if you use Calendar as part of
your organization's Google Apps account (so your user name is something like me@mycompany.com or
me@mycollege.com—see Chapter 10 for the scoop on Google Apps for organizations), you've got a couple of
tricks up your sleeve that ordinary Calendar users don't have. When you create or edit an event, you can check
whether your guests are available, and you can reserve stuff you need for your event without leaving the
event's details page. The following sections show you how.
NOTE
Anyone who uses Calendar through a Google Apps account (Chapter 10) can check his guests'
availability. To schedule resources, your organization must subscribe to Google Apps Premier or
Education edition (see the box on [click here])—Standard Edition doesn't offer this feature.
7.6.1. Check People's Availability
Trying to schedule a meeting via phone calls and emails can be super-frustrating: Emails get ignored,
voicemails never get picked up, and the meeting never gets put on anyone's calendar. But the administrator of
your organization's Google Apps account (maybe that's you) can set things up so that everyone in the
organization has access to everyone else's calendars. So when you need to schedule a meeting, you can check
the calendars of everyone who'll attend, and schedule a time when you know everyone's free. Here's how:
In your Calendar, click Create Event (or, if you've already created the event, click the event, and then
"Edit event details").
Google opens the page shown in Figure 7-35. It's a lot like the page you saw in Figure 7-4, except for one
link (under the When boxes): "Check guest and resource availability".
1.
Click the link to see when people are booked.
Google opens the "Find a Time" box, shown in Figure 7-36.
2.
In the lower-left Add box, start typing a person's name. (Google makes suggestions as you type; click a
name to put it in the box.) Then click Add.
Google checks that person's calendar, and adds her to the guest list. If someone has an event scheduled,
Google blocks off that time segment in the calendar.
3.
Scroll through the calendar to find times when everyone's free. Adjust the times in the When box as
needed. When you've found a time that works from everyone, click OK.
Google takes you back to the event's details page, with the guests you selected added to the right-hand
Guests list.
4.

Click Save.
Google asks whether you want to send invitations to the guests.
5.
Click Send (to shoot off an email notification) or "Don't send" (to add the event to everyone's calendars
without sending an email).
Google creates the event and adds it to all the guest's calendars—and you know they have no excuse for
not showing up.
6.
Figure 7-35. Click the "Check guest and resource availability" link to see when folks are free to
meet.
Figure 7-36. As you add guests to an event, Google checks their schedules and lets you know if
there's a conflict. Here, one guest has something scheduled at 3:30 (shown by the colored block in
that time slot, circled), so a 3-o'clock meeting won't work.

7.6.2. Schedule Resources
A resource is just about anything you can reserve for an event: a conference room, a projector, a public-address
system—even a basketball court. If your organization has a Google Apps Premier or Education account (the box
on [click here] explains about those), then you can schedule resources when you create or edit an event, so
everyone knows that a particular resource is spoken for. When you reserve a resource, no one else can schedule
for the same time.
NOTE
Before you can schedule a resource, a domain administrator has to create some resources for the
domain; [click here] explains how.
After an administrator has created resources for your company's domain, here's how to reserve them:
Click Create Event or click an existing event's "edit event details" link.
The event's details page, shown in Figure 7-35, opens.
1.
Click the "Check guest and resource availability" link.
The "Find a Time" box opens, looking something like Figure 7-37. In the lower-left part of the box, you see
the Room Finder, where resources appear. (Resources don't have to be rooms, that's just what Google
calls them.)
2.
In the Room Finder, click a resource to reserve it.
The resource appears in the right-hand pane.
0.
Click Add Room. (The button says this no matter what kind of resource you're adding.)
1.

If you want, you can also check guests' schedules and add them to the event.
Google adds the resource to the guest list. (Resources are treated like guests whose time is reserved for
that slot.)
2.
Click OK to close the Find a Time box, and then click Save to create the event.
You're all set. Now no one can say they didn't know you were planning to use the PA system on
Wednesday at 4 p.m.—you've got first dibs.
3.
Figure 7-37. In the lower-left part of the "Find a Time" box, Calendar's Room Finder shows the
organization's resources. To show only certain resources, in the Filter box, type a term (like
projector or room). If a resource is already reserved, an X (circled) appears by its name. Select the
resource you want, and then click Add Room to put it on the list of guests. When a resource is on
your event's Guests list, no one else can reserve it for that time slot.
 

 
Part 3: Creating Web Pages
Chapter 8
Chapter 9
Chapter 8. iGoogle: Google Your Way
For years Google's distinctive home page—uncluttered and dead simple to use—has stood in stark contrast to
the hyperlink carnivals on display at sites like Yahoo, AOL, and MSN. Whereas those firms' design motto seemed
to be More! Louder! Colors! Google offered a noticeably leaner philosophy: less, quiet, easier. (It sure didn't
hurt that its search results were often better.)
But now, Google is beginning to let its fans dress up at least one page on its site. With the infinitely
customizable iGoogle service, you can stock your own Google welcome screen with as much (or as little) content
as you like. Want an up-to-the-minute weather report? Check. How about current national news headlines?
Check. Interested in local movie times, the hottest YouTube videos, the latest sports scores? Check, check, and
check. Whatever you want to know, you can find it out by personalizing your iGoogle page.
iGoogle also gives you centralized access to your Google apps. From your iGoogle page, you can chat with
friends, keep an eye on your Gmail inbox, see when a collaborator has updated a spreadsheet, and display your
Google Calendar.
This chapter tells you how to set up and customize your iGoogle page, putting the whole Internet right at your
fingertips.
8.1. Creating an iGoogle Page
Start by going to http://www.google.com. If you haven't created an iGoogle page yet, then you see the familiar,
minimalist Google search page. Look in the upper-right corner for the "Sign in" link; click it, and then log into
your Google Account (see Chapter 1). You can also go straight to iGoogle by typing http://www.igoogle.com or
http://www.google.com/ig into your Web browser's address bar. Once you've done that, click the upper-right
iGoogle link to transform Google into a page that looks like Figure 8-1. This page gives you an idea of what you
can do with iGoogle: Decide what you want on the page, choose a theme (a unified design style for the page),
and create tabs ([click here]) to hold related collections of content (one tab for work, one for personal stuff, and
so on).
Figure 8-1. When you first open iGoogle, the page looks something like this. You can choose a theme
(which controls how the page looks) and create tabs for iGoogle based on the categories listed here.
Or you can click the upper-right X (circled) to close the box, and then build your iGoogle page from
the ground up.

If you want, choose a theme, pick some categories from the box in the middle of the page, and then click the
"See your page" button. (You aren't stuck with the settings you choose—you can always change them later, as
explained throughout this chapter.) Or, if you want to check out more themes and content before you make any
decisions, click the upper-right X to close the box and start exploring everything iGoogle has to offer.
If you chose some categories, Google loads up your new iGoogle page with content and gadgets related to your
choices. Gadgets, as you'll read on [click here], are mini-applications that can help you with your work (such as
dictionary gadgets or gadgets related to your Google apps), provide you with the latest news headlines, and
keep you up to speed with your interests and hobbies (recipes, sports scores, travel info, gardening tips, local
movie times, and a whole lot more).
8.1.1. What's on an iGoogle Page?
The short answer is: "Just about anything you want." The rest of this chapter tells you how to customize and
work with your iGoogle page, but when you first create a new page, it's worth taking a quick tour.
Figure 8-2 shows a typical iGoogle page. Going from top to bottom, you see these sections:
Figure 8-2. A typical iGoogle page has a Google search box and links, as well as tabs (circled, left)
and customization links (circled, right). But the star of the show is the stuff that takes up most of
the page. Here, that includes horoscopes, headlines, and weather.

Google links. On the left side of the page, choose from links to popular Google services, like Google
Images and Google Maps. On the right side is the email address you're currently signed in with, along with
links to switch from iGoogle to the classic Google search page, visit your Google Account, and sign out.
Search box. The familiar Google search box appears prominently near the top of the page, where you
can't miss it.
Tabs. On the left side of the page, you see tabs that let you switch between different iGoogle pages. To
find out how to add tabs to iGoogle, see [click here].
Customization links. On the right side of the page, you see two links for customizing iGoogle: "Select
theme" for changing iGoogle's appearance ([click here]), and "Add stuff" for customizing its content ([click
here]).
Content. iGoogle devotes most of the page to the main event: The stuff you put there. Your iGoogle
gadgets—the content boxes and mini-programs—appear here. You can add new gadgets ([click here]),
rearrange what's there ([click here]), and delete stuff you don't need ([click here]).
NOTE
If you use Google Apps through work or another organization (see Chapter 10), then you have

access to a Start Page ([click here]), which is a lot like iGoogle. The Start Page has your
organization's name somewhere in its Web address—it probably looks something like
http://start.mycompany.com. Start Pages are like iGoogle, with a couple of exceptions. Although
you can customize a Start Page by adding or moving around gadgets, you can't select a theme or
create tabs. Even if you have a Start Page, though, you can still create your own iGoogle page. All
you need is a personal Google Account (Chapter 1).

Chapter 8. iGoogle: Google Your Way
For years Google's distinctive home page—uncluttered and dead simple to use—has stood in stark contrast to
the hyperlink carnivals on display at sites like Yahoo, AOL, and MSN. Whereas those firms' design motto seemed
to be More! Louder! Colors! Google offered a noticeably leaner philosophy: less, quiet, easier. (It sure didn't
hurt that its search results were often better.)
But now, Google is beginning to let its fans dress up at least one page on its site. With the infinitely
customizable iGoogle service, you can stock your own Google welcome screen with as much (or as little) content
as you like. Want an up-to-the-minute weather report? Check. How about current national news headlines?
Check. Interested in local movie times, the hottest YouTube videos, the latest sports scores? Check, check, and
check. Whatever you want to know, you can find it out by personalizing your iGoogle page.
iGoogle also gives you centralized access to your Google apps. From your iGoogle page, you can chat with
friends, keep an eye on your Gmail inbox, see when a collaborator has updated a spreadsheet, and display your
Google Calendar.
This chapter tells you how to set up and customize your iGoogle page, putting the whole Internet right at your
fingertips.
8.1. Creating an iGoogle Page
Start by going to http://www.google.com. If you haven't created an iGoogle page yet, then you see the familiar,
minimalist Google search page. Look in the upper-right corner for the "Sign in" link; click it, and then log into
your Google Account (see Chapter 1). You can also go straight to iGoogle by typing http://www.igoogle.com or
http://www.google.com/ig into your Web browser's address bar. Once you've done that, click the upper-right
iGoogle link to transform Google into a page that looks like Figure 8-1. This page gives you an idea of what you
can do with iGoogle: Decide what you want on the page, choose a theme (a unified design style for the page),
and create tabs ([click here]) to hold related collections of content (one tab for work, one for personal stuff, and
so on).
Figure 8-1. When you first open iGoogle, the page looks something like this. You can choose a theme
(which controls how the page looks) and create tabs for iGoogle based on the categories listed here.
Or you can click the upper-right X (circled) to close the box, and then build your iGoogle page from
the ground up.

If you want, choose a theme, pick some categories from the box in the middle of the page, and then click the
"See your page" button. (You aren't stuck with the settings you choose—you can always change them later, as
explained throughout this chapter.) Or, if you want to check out more themes and content before you make any
decisions, click the upper-right X to close the box and start exploring everything iGoogle has to offer.

you can customize a Start Page by adding or moving around gadgets, you can't select a theme or
create tabs. Even if you have a Start Page, though, you can still create your own iGoogle page. All
you need is a personal Google Account (Chapter 1).
 

 
8.2. Customizing iGoogle
With iGoogle, it's all about customization. It's your page, and you can make it look however you want. You get
to choose what appears on the page, select a design theme, and arrange what's there in a way that makes
sense to you.
8.2.1. Adding a Theme
A lot of people like the classic Google theme: bright colors on a white background. A page with this theme looks
clean and doesn't call a lot of attention to itself. With iGoogle, you can stick with the familiar Google theme, or
jazz up your iGoogle page by picking a different one. iGoogle themes usually include some page-top illustration
and a complementary page-wide color scheme. Figure 8-3 shows an example.
If you've ever had a hankering to hang some world-class art on your wall, iGoogle offers
the next-best thing: themes designed by internationally known artists, designers, and
celebrities. Artist themes range from album art for your favorite bands to cartoons to
fine art. On your iGoogle page, click "Get artist themes" to see what's on offer.
To add (or change) a theme, click the upper-right "Select theme" link. This action opens the page shown in
Figure 8-4. Here, you can browse themes or search for something specific:
Browse. The left-hand side of the page groups current themes in three categories: Hottest, "Most users",
and Newest. Click one of these links to see the themes in that category. Use the numbers at the bottom of
each page to keep browsing until you find a theme you like.
Search. If you've got something specific in mind, type a search term like beach or city in the upper-right
"Search for themes" box, and then click Search.
Figure 8-3. Some iGoogle themes, like this one (called Beach), change according to the time of day
or weather, showing sunrise, daylight, sunset, and nighttime colors. Type your city into the Enter
Location box (circled), click Save, and then sit back and imagine the sand between your toes.

Figure 8-4. To see the newest or most popular themes, choose one of the links on the left (circled).
To search for a specific theme, use the upper-right search box. When you find a theme you like,
apply it to iGoogle by clicking its "Add it now" button (circled for Beach).

As you look at themes, you can read a description of each theme, as well as people's
comments, by clicking the theme's name.
When you find a theme you want, click the "Add it now" button just below the image. Google applies the theme
and takes you back to your newly redesigned page. Most themes change not only the iGoogle header, but also
the footer and the overall color scheme.
8.2.2. Changing a Theme
You can change your iGoogle theme whenever you want. If the current theme doesn't match your mood, click
the "Select theme" link, and then repeat the process for adding a theme.
You can also change the theme of a particular tab ([click here]). To change the look of the Home tab, for
example, click the down arrow next to Home, and then select "Edit this tab" to open the Preferences page.
Scroll down to the Theme section, and then select "Change theme". Google opens the theme gallery shown in
Figure 8-4. From there, find a theme you like, and then click its "Add it now" button. (Following these steps
changes the look of that specific tab. If you want to change others, too, then you have to change them
individually.)
Power Users' Clinic: Make Your Own Theme
If you've got an artistic streak and know some XML—a formatting language loved by publishing
geeks worldwide—you can create your own theme. (The details of how to create a theme get a bit
technical, so if you don't know XML, save some brain cells and move on.)
From a developer's point of view, a theme is an XML file that holds key-value pairs for various
attributes of the iGoogle page, such as text color and background color. Themes have one or more
skins, or visual designs. Within the theme specification, a configuration map represents each skin,
so a theme is really a collection of configuration maps.
To create a theme, follow these steps (read about them in detail in the theme developer's guide at
http://code.google.com/apis/themes/docs/dev_guide.html):
Create your design. An iGoogle page has a header and footer, and you can also choose
colors for the content area. Headers and footers are built out of layered tiles, which combine
to look like a single image. (Google uses tiles so the image still displays properly when
someone resizes the iGoogle window.)
Fill out the theme template. All iGoogle pages share a number of common elements. For
example, whatever the theme, pages have to include the iGoogle logo, the links across the
top of the page, tabs, and certain buttons.

Submit your theme to iGoogle's theme gallery. If you want to let other people use your
theme for their own iGoogle pages, you have to submit the theme to Google for approval.
You can create the XML file that defines your theme in any text editor, such as Notepad, WordPad,
or TextWrangler. As you work on your theme, keep these iGoogle rules in mind:
All iGoogle content—logos, links, and text—must be both visible and usable.
If you include trademarks or logos, these must be within the designated attribution area.
You cannot change, remove, or make fun of iGoogle's logo. (In the theme developer's guide,
Google lists the acceptable designs for the iGoogle logo.)
Google has the final say about which themes make it into the theme gallery.
Google likes dynamic themes, which use a number of different skins to show the passage of time
(such as landscapes that change according to the time of day or current weather conditions) or tell
a story (check out the Tea House theme for a cute example). Dynamic themes use different skins
for different periods of time. Use the <Trait> tag to specify the period of time that applies to a
particular skin. For dynamic themes to work, you need to define all the attributes for each and
every skin.
After you've designed a theme, test it to see how it looks and whether it behaves the way it's
supposed to. Before you can test your theme, you need to host its XML file and its images on a
public server. (Try the Google Gadgets Editor at
http://code.google.com/apis/gadgets/docs/gs.html#GGE.) Test the theme by opening a browser
and pointing it to www.google.com?skin=<theme-url>, where <theme-url> is the actual Web
address of your hosted theme.
You can use that test URL and send it to your friends if you created the theme just for fun. But to
share your theme with the world, you need to submit it to Google for approval. Make sure your
theme is thoroughly tested and workable, and then submit it here:
www.google.com/ig/skin_submit. Google has a bunch of terms and conditions for you to read and
agree to. At the bottom of the submission page is a text box where you enter the URL of your
theme so Google can check it out.
8.2.3. Adding Gadgets (Content)
Themes make iGoogle look good, but content is king. The whole point of creating an iGoogle page is to see
useful or entertaining stuff without having to go looking for it. Google gets you off to a good start by
automatically putting popular items (like YouTube videos and CNN.com headlines) on your iGoogle page, but
you can customize your page to match your own interests and preferences by choosing from a dizzying array of
categories and topics.
iGoogle's content comes in the form of gadgets. Each gadget is a mini-program that displays information and

interacts with you. Gadgets are compact, so you can fit lots of them on a single page. And if you go gadget
crazy, you can add tabs ([click here]) to hold even more gadgets. You can also edit gadgets' settings, as [click
here] explains.
You can also add gadgets to Google Desktop (Google's tool for searching the files on
your computer) or to your own Web page. To find out more about using gadgets beyond
iGoogle, check out the gadgets info page for Webmasters:
www.google.com/webmasters/gadgets.
To find gadgets you're interested in, click the upper-right "Add stuff" link. This opens the page shown in Figure
8-5, where you can choose from a whole gaggle of Google gadgets.
Figure 8-5. This page gives you an idea of some of the gadgets available for your iGoogle page, but it
doesn't even begin to scratch the surface. To browse the hundreds of available gadgets, use the left-
hand category links or the right-hand search box.
As with themes, you can browse gadget categories or search for a particular gadget. Type Google apps into the
upper-right search box, for example, and you get dozens of results that can pull your various apps together on
your iGoogle page.
When you find a gadget you want to add, click its "Add it now" button. (If you don't like a gadget, it's easy to
remove, so go ahead and try a few of 'em.) Google adds the gadget to your iGoogle page and displays a link
that says, "You might also like". Click the link to see other gadgets popular with people who use the gadget you

just added to your page.
NOTE
There are more than 20,000 iGoogle gadgets, so you're sure to find plenty that are fun, entertaining, or
just plain useful.
After you've added a gadget, keep browsing or click the upper-right "Back to iGoogle home" link to return to
your iGoogle page.
After you've added some gadgets to iGoogle, jump to [click here] to learn more about
working with them.
8.2.4. Adding Newsfeeds
A lot of gadgets, such as those that show current headlines, work with newsfeeds, which show frequently
updated information. But you might want to read a newsfeed for a site that doesn't have its own iGoogle
gadget. For example, if you're a fan of a particular blog that you read regularly (and the blog provides a
newsfeed), you can subscribe to it on your iGoogle page. That way, when the blogger writes a new post, iGoogle
lets you know, showing the post's title and a preview of what it's about.
To add a custom newsfeed, follow these steps:
On your iGoogle page, click the "Add stuff" link.
Google opens the page shown in Figure 8-5.
1.
Look at the bottom of the left-hand menu for the "Add feed or gadget" link; click it.
A box appears, as shown in Figure 8-6.
2.
Type in the Web address of the blog or site to which you want to subscribe, and then click Add.
Google adds the feed to iGoogle.
3.
Figure 8-6. To subscribe to a site's newsfeed, type the site's Web address in the box shown here,
and then click Add. Google confirms that it's added the site to your iGoogle page.

When you return to your iGoogle page, you see a gadget with the name of the blog or site you added, as shown
in Figure 8-7.

Figure 8-7. Here's what newsfeeds look like on iGoogle. Each post is an individual link you can click
to go to the blog. To read a post without leaving iGoogle, click its + sign (circled), and the box
expands so you can read the post.
8.2.5. Changing the Layout
If you keep your phone book on the right side of your desk, you want it to be there when you reach for it. Just
as you arrange your desk so you can easily find things, you can arrange your iGoogle page so that each gadget
is where you want it.
8.2.5.1. Move a gadget
To rearrange the gadgets on your iGoogle page, all you have to do is drag them, like so:
On your iGoogle page, place your cursor on the bar at the top of the gadget.
The cursor turns into a four-way arrow.
1.
Click and drag.
2.

The gadget turns transparent, as Figure 8-8 shows, and moves with your cursor as you drag it across the
screen. Dotted rectangles show the gadget's location—first where you're moving it from, and then where
you're moving it. Other gadgets jump around to make room for the one you're moving.
When you've moved the gadget to its new location, let go of your mouse button.
The gadget drops into place. That was easy, wasn't it?
3.
Figure 8-8. The gadget you're moving turns transparent as you drag it across the screen (here, the
ToDo gadget is being moved). The dotted-line outline shown here indicates the gadget's original
location. A new dotted line outline appears as soon you drag the gadget to a new position, indicating
where the gadget will land if you let go of the mouse button.
8.2.5.2. Change the layout of your iGoogle page
When you create a new iGoogle page, its layout is three columns of equal width, but you can use another
arrangement, if you like. To change the layout of your iGoogle home page, look on the left side of the page and
click the Home tab's drop-down arrow, and then select "Edit this tab".
This opens the Preferences page. Scroll down to the Layout section, shown in Figure 8-9. Here you can see the
different layouts available. Turn on the radio button of the layout you want, and then click Save to apply the
new layout.

Figure 8-9. To change a layout, simply turn on the radio button next to the layout you like, and then
click Save.
Because gadgets are small, the three-column layout works well. However, if your gadgets are text-heavy, you
might want to give your eyes a bit more reading room, so you can experiment with other layouts. Figure 8-10
shows an example of a two-column layout.
Figure 8-10. This two-column layout makes gadgets wider and the page less crowded.

You can use a different layout for each tab of your iGoogle page. (See [click here] for more on tabs.)
8.2.6. Setting Your Search Preferences
Google offers a number of preferences you can set when conducting a search, such as how many results to
display or whether to filter out undesirable Web sites.
To set your search preferences, first sign into iGoogle. To the right of the search box, click the Search
Preferences link. Google opens a page like the one in Figure 8-11. On the Global Preferences page, you can
adjust these settings:
Interface Language. This is the language Google uses to communicate with you.
Figure 8-11. When you sign into iGoogle and set your search preferences, Google saves your
settings, so they go with you whenever and wherever you use your iGoogle account.

Search Language. Here, you can search for pages written in any language or limit your results to one or
more specific languages.
To make searches as wide as possible, leave the Search Language section set to
"Search for pages written in any language". If necessary, you can use Google
Language Tools to translate pages. Language Tools can translate any of about a
dozen languages into English. Click the Language Tools link (next to the Google
search box) to have Google translate a page for you. Or, if you get a result in a
language you don't know, click "Translate this page" next to the result.
SafeSearch Filtering. It's a common experience: You search for something innocuous (like, say, door
knockers) and unwanted porn sites turn up in your results. SafeSearch filtering keeps inappropriate sites
out of your results list. You can set filtering to strict (filters out sites that have explicit text or images),
moderate (filters out explicit images), or none. (This setting is automatically set to moderate unless you
change it.)
Number of Results. When you do a search, Google displays 10 results per page, but you can change that
here. Your options are 10, 20, 30, 50, or 100 results per page. Keep in mind, though, that the usual 10

results per page makes for the fastest searching.
Results Window. Turn on this checkbox if you want your Google search results to open in a new browser
window.
NOTE
The Global Preferences page really is global: Any settings you change here apply to whichever
Google search you use: Google Web Search, Google News, Google Blog Search, Google Video,
Google Books, and so on.
When you've set your preferences the way you like 'em, click Save Preferences. A confirmation box appears;
click OK, and your settings take effect.
8.2.6.1. Use subscribed links to target your search results
Part of Google's awe-inducing service to humanity is that you can type in a word or phrase, click Search, and in
a microsecond Google searches a gazillion Web pages and returns two or three million results. But given the
fact that pretty much anyone can post pretty much anything on the Web, how do you know which results are
trustworthy?
Subscribed links can help you sift through the dross and find the nuggets of gold in your search results. When
you subscribe to a link and search from your iGoogle page (or even classic Google, as long as you're signed in),
you're telling Google to include any relevant results from that site, which you deem especially trustworthy. For
example, if you're shopping for a used car, you can subscribe to links from the well-known car info site
Edmunds.com. Then, when you search for, say, Toyota Corolla or Hummer H3, your search results contain a link
to Edmunds.com, where you can go to read reviews, price comparisons, and so on. Subscribed links show a
special icon in your results list, shown in Figure 8-12, so you'll know that you okayed this source.
Figure 8-12. When you subscribe to links from a particular site, Google marks relevant search results
(circled) with the Subscribed Links icon. Click the "Manage my Subscribed Links" link to add or
remove subscribed links.

A few points to keep in mind about subscribed links:
Subscriptions are available only to people who have a Google Account, and they work only when you're
signed into your account.
Most subscribed link information comes from third parties, not from Google. So Google doesn't make
promises or representations about a particular site's quality. It's up to you to decide whether a site is
trustworthy and a good addition to your Subscribed Links list.
Google doesn't charge anything for including a site in its Subscribed Links directory (explained next), nor
does it accept any payment to put a site at the top of the directory.
When you've subscribed to some links, doing a search still returns all the millions of regular Google results
you've come to know and love. Google simply marks any subscribed links so you can find them easily.

To subscribe to links from particular sites, sign into iGoogle, click the Search Preferences link next to the search
box, and then follow these steps:
On the Global Preference page, scroll down to the Subscribed Links section, which shows a few examples
of subscribed links. Click the "Subscribed Links directory" link.
The Subscribed Links directory, shown in Figure 8-13, opens in a new window.
1.
Figure 8-13. Browse the Subscribed Links directory using the category links on the left. Click a site's
name to read a description of the site. When you find a site whose info you want to highlight in
search results, click its Subscribe button (circled). After you've subscribed to a link, its button
changes to read Unsubscribe (as is the case for the CalorieLab listing).
Browse through the directory, using the left-hand menu to look for Subscribed Links in categories that
interest you. When you see a site you'd like to add to your subscribed links, click the Subscribe button to
its right.
Google adds that site to your Subscribed Links list.
0.
Browse for as long as you like. When you're done adding subscriptions, close the window that shows the
Subscribed Links directory.
Google saves your preferences.
1.

8.2.6.2. Unsubscribe from a subscribed link
If a site isn't as helpful as you'd hoped or you don't need that kind of info anymore, you can unsubscribe from
its links. From your iGoogle page, click Search Preferences. On the Global Preferences page, scroll down to the
Subscribed Links section, and then click the Manage link. A new window like the one in Figure 8-14 opens,
showing your subscribed links. To unsubscribe from a site, simply click its Unsubscribe button, go back to the
Global Preferences page, click the Save Preferences button, and then click OK to confirm.
Figure 8-14. If you want to unsubscribe from a site, click its Unsubscribe button to remove it from
your My Subscriptions list.
If you've just done a search and want a shortcut to the page where you manage
Subscribed Links, in the search results list, click "Manage my Subscribed Links".
8.2.7. Saving Your Customization
As you customize your iGoogle page—adding a couple of gadgets here, moving things around there—you want
to make sure that the changes you make will stick. As with other Google apps, Google periodically saves your
iGoogle page automatically. But, as anyone who's ever used a computer knows, it's always a good idea to back
things up from time to time. For a do-it-yourself backup of your iGoogle page, look on the page's left side, and
click the down arrow next to Home. From the menu that appears, select "Edit this tab". This opens the page
shown back in Figure 8-9. Scroll all the way down the page to the Troubleshooting/Restore section.
Click the Backup button, and Google saves your current iGoogle page. Click the Save button to go back to
iGoogle.

8.2.7.1. Go back to the previous version of iGoogle
If you've done a major reorganization of iGoogle—adding new gadgets, creating new tabs, moving everything
around—but then you decide you liked things better the way they were, you can get your old page back in a
jiffy. Whether you manually created a backup of your iGoogle page or Google created one for you, you have the
option of taking your iGoogle page a step back in time, to the last saved version. In iGoogle, click the Home
tab's down arrow, and then select "Edit this tab". On the page that opens, scroll down to the
Troubleshooting/Restore section. Here, Google tells you when your iGoogle page was last saved. To go back to
that saved version, click Restore Now. Click the Save button to return to iGoogle, which now looks like the
version you just restored.
 

 
8.3. Customizing, Sharing, and Creating Gadgets
Adding gadgets ([click here]) puts info on your iGoogle page, and moving gadgets ([click here]) lets you
customize their layout. But there's more you can do with Google gadgets, from customizing them to sharing a
cool one with a friend.
8.3.1. Customizing Gadgets
Some gadgets let you customize them in various ways. For example, a weather gadget might be able to show
more than one location, or a news gadget might let you choose how many headlines you want it to display. To
see whether you can customize a gadget, on your iGoogle page, look in the gadget's upper-right corner, click
the down arrow you see there, and then, from the menu that appears, select "Edit settings". (If there's no "Edit
settings" option on the menu, you can't customize that gadget—what you see is what you get.)
The gadget expands to show what you can edit. Figure 8-15 shows some examples of different ways to edit
gadgets. You can typically edit things like your location and language, but it depends on the gadget. When
you've made your changes, click Save.
Figure 8-15. The Weather gadget on the left lets you display the temperature in Fahrenheit or
Celsius, as well as add several cities. In the center, the Google News gadget is highly customizable:
You can select a local or international edition, tell Google how many headlines to display and in what
categories, and more.

When you find a gadget you really like, you can use it to find other great gadgets. Click
the gadget's upper-right down arrow, and then click "You might also like". This opens a
page that shows other gadgets chosen by people who use this gadget.
8.3.2. Sharing Gadgets
When you discover a great gadget, you'll probably want to tell your friends. You can do that by sharing the
gadget—having Google send your friend an email with a link to the gadget you've discovered. You can share in
three ways:
From the gadget itself. In the gadget's upper-right corner, click the down arrow, and then, from the
menu that appears, select "Share this gadget".
From a tab's Edit page. Click the tab where the gadget lives, click the tab's drop-down arrow, and then
select "Edit this tab". On the page that opens, the Gadget section holds a list of gadgets on that tab.
From the gadget gallery. On your iGoogle page, click the "Add stuff" link, and then find the gadget you
like. Click its name, and a page opens describing the gadget. Click the "Share this gadget" link.
Whichever method you choose, Google opens the "Share this gadget" box, shown in Figure 8-16. If you have a
Gmail or Google Talk account, the box displays people from your Contacts list ([click here]). Just turn on the
checkbox next to anyone you want to invite. Alternatively, you can type or paste email addresses into the text
box (remember to put commas between addresses). Or, if you'd rather write your own email to send the link,
click "Or copy and paste a link to this gadget", and the box expands to show you the gadget's link. Copy it and
click the Cancel button, and then paste the link into your email to help folks find the gadget.
Figure 8-16. Your Google address book makes it a snap to share gadgets with friends, family, and
colleagues: Simply turn on the checkboxes you want, and then click Send Invites.

When you're ready to invite people to share the gadget, click Send Invites. Google sends the people you chose
an email that contains a link to the gadget. When the one of them clicks the link, he sees the gadget displayed
on a Web page, where he can click the "Add to Google" button. If he's signed into his Google Account, Google
adds the gadget to his iGoogle page. Otherwise, he's invited to sign in or create a Google Account.
Some gadgets, like sticky notes or a to-do list, let you add and edit content yourself.
When you share these gadgets with a friend, you can give that friend the ability to see
the gadget and (if you want) to edit what's in it. When people you've shared with edit a
gadget, they can change its content, so your spouse or your boss can add another item
to your to-do list, for example, or change an item's priority. Google lets you know
whether a gadget is editable when you share it: At the bottom of the "Share this
gadget" box, choose "View my content" or "View and edit my content", and then click
Send Invites.
8.3.3. Creating Your Own Gadgets
Even though you can customize many iGoogle gadgets, wouldn't it be fun to have a gadget that really expresses
you, by showing off a favorite photo or letting friends know what you're thinking? Good news: Google offers
seven do-it-yourself gadgets just waiting for a shot of your personal flair—no programming required. You can
use these custom gadgets on your iGoogle page or share them with your friends.

To create your own iGoogle gadget, start on your iGoogle page, and then click the "Add stuff" link. On the page
that opens, find the "Create your own gadget" section (it's under the search box), and then click its "Try now"
link. This action opens the "Make your own gadget" page, shown in Figure 8-17.
Figure 8-17. The "Make your own gadget" page is your starting point for creating a truly customized
gadget. For each gadget, the page shows an example. Click any "get started" link to create your own
gadget.
You can create seven different styles of gadgets:
Framed photo. This gadget holds up to seven of your favorite photos, along with captions. The photos
can change daily, or whenever the viewer refreshes iGoogle.
Google gram. A Google gram is a series of seven virtual gifts (balloons, roses, chocolates, and so on)
that change from day to day. You choose a type of gift, and then write a message to go with each one.
Daily me. This gadget shows a picture of you and lets you communicate your thoughts on a bunch of
different topics, from your current status (are you blissed out? mad at the world? rushing to meet an
impossible deadline?) to books you're reading or shows you're watching. There's also a soapbox section
where you can post a mini-rant. You can update the gadget whenever the mood strikes.

Free form. As its name implies, this gadget can be about whatever you want. You give the gadget a title
(like CD Pick of the Week or Daily Wisdom from Me), upload an image, add some text, and then arrange
the elements until you like the look.
YouTube channel. Be your own vee-jay by lining up your favorite YouTube videos to share (or watch
yourself). You can add up to 10 videos to this gadget.
Personal list. Are you one of those people who's always making lists? You can create your very own list
gadget for your iGoogle page. Whether it's a to-do list; a reminder of your goals for the week, month, or
year; a Letterman-style Top Ten list; or something entirely different is up to you. Personal lists can hold
up to 10 items.
Countdown. When you're counting the days until a big event—a holiday, a get-together, days till
retirement—this gadget counts with you. Give the gadget a title, choose an image or upload a photo, tell
it the date you're waiting for, and create an optional message for the gadget to proclaim when the big day
finally arrives.
How you create a gadget depends on the kind of gadget you select. In general, you supply text and, for most
gadgets, an image. (You can upload images from your computer, select from your Picasa Web album, or provide
a Web address for photos posted online.) You can also change the gadget's background color and make other
tweaks. To see how your creation is coming along, click Preview Changes. When you like what you see, click
Create Gadget.
Google creates your gadget, and then adds it to your iGoogle page. It also opens the page shown in Figure 8-
18, asking whether you want to share your new gadget ([click here]). This gives friends the option of putting
the gadget on their own iGoogle pages; it even gets updated on their pages when you make any changes to it.
Here are your sharing options:
If you want to share, tell Google the email addresses of the folks you want to share with, add an optional
message, and then click the "Send invitations" button.
If you don't want to share (you can always share the gadget later by following the instructions on [click
here]), then click the "Skip for now" link.
Figure 8-18. If you want to share your newly created gadget, type or paste in email addresses of
people with whom you'd like to share. (Remember to put a comma between addresses.) If you don't
want to share just yet, then click the "Skip for now" link (circled).

You've got one more decision to make: whether to publish your gadget. On the Publishing Options page (Figure
8-19), turn on one of these radio buttons:
Do not publish. Your gadget remains private, available only to you and your friends. (Friends can also
share the gadget, though.) This option's already turned on for you.
Publish my gadget to the directory. This option adds the gadget you created to the gadget gallery
([click here]). Anyone can find it and add it to their iGoogle pages.
NOTE
It takes up to 10 days for a published gadget to appear in iGoogle's gallery.
Figure 8-19. To publish or not to publish? Use this page to decide whether to include your gadget in
the iGoogle gadget directory. (You can always change your mind later.) If you decide to publish the
gadget, you need to tell Google your name and location, and write a description of your gadget.

Make your selection, and then click Save. Google returns you to your iGoogle page, with your new gadget
proudly displayed. Figure 8-20 shows some sample custom gadgets.
Figure 8-20. Gadgets you created say "my gadget" in the title bar. Use the upper-right buttons to
update, minimize/maximize, or delete the gadget.

8.3.3.1. Update a gadget you created
The fun thing about gadgets is that they're dynamic—they don't just sit there, they change. After all, there
wouldn't be much point to a "Daily Me" gadget that never changed.
When you want to make a change to a gadget you created, click its upper-right down arrow, and then, from the
menu that appears, select "Update gadget". This action takes you back to a page just like the one where you
created the gadget, but with its current images, text, and settings already filled in. Make whatever changes you
want, and then click Update Gadget. Google updates the gadget and displays the new version. If other people
are using your gadget, it gets updated on their iGoogle pages, too.
8.3.3.2. Publish a gadget you created
You can choose to publish a gadget when you first create it (as explained on [click here]), but whatever decision
you make then isn't final. You can add your gadget to the iGoogle gallery, or take it out, at any time by clicking
a gadget's upper-right down arrow, and then selecting "Publishing options". This takes you back to the
Publishing Options page you saw in Figure 8-19. Make your selection, and then click Save.
8.3.3.3. Share a gadget you created
Gadgets are meant for sharing. To invite others to put a gadget you created on their own iGoogle page, click
your gadget's drop-down arrow, and then, from its menu, choose "Invite viewers". This action opens the page
shown in Figure 8-18, where you can tell people about your gadget and invite them to see it, too.
8.3.4. Deleting a Gadget
If your iGoogle page is getting crowded, you can get rid of a few gadgets to free up some space. (You can also
add tabs, as explained in the next section.)

If you don't want to get rid of a gadget completely, you can minimize it so just its title bar appears on your
iGoogle page. Click the - sign in the gadget's title bar to minimize it. To expand a minimized gadget back to full
size, click its + sign.
To get rid of a gadget for good, you need to delete that gadget. Click the X in the gadget's upper-right corner.
Google displays a confirmation box asking if you really want to get rid of this gadget. Click OK, and it's gone.
Right after you've deleted a gadget, Google displays a message bar near the top of the page, telling you it's
deleted the gadget. If you have a sudden (and quick) change of heart, click Undo to restore the gadget.
If you don't see an Undo link at the top of the page, you can try restoring a deleted
gadget by rolling iGoogle back to its last saved version ([click here] explains how). Or,
you can always find the gadget in the gadget gallery, and add it to your page again
([click here]).
 

 
8.4. Organizing iGoogle Pages with Tabs
As you browse through all the gadgets you can add to iGoogle, you may find yourself wishing you had more
space so you could add tons of them. Turns out you do! Increase your iGoogle real estate by adding tabs. Each
tab is like a separate page within your iGoogle page. Tabs appear on the left-hand side of iGoogle, just above
the gadgets. Click a tab to display it.
Tabs are great for organizing your iGoogle content. For example, you might create a tab to hold all the gadgets
related to your Google apps. If you're a frequent traveler, create a Travel tab for gadgets related to flight info,
destination weather, hotel price comparisons, and so on. Film buffs can dedicate a tab to gadgets that show
local movie times, new DVD releases, what's on top at the box office, and more. Whatever your interest or
need, you can create a tab and fill it up with relevant gadgets.
8.4.1. Add a Tab
When you first create your iGoogle page, Google displays a box that lets you choose some categories of
interest, like News, Humor, Music, and so on. (Flip back to Figure 8-1 for a reminder of what this looks like). If
you turn on some of these checkboxes, and then click "See your page", Google automatically creates a tab for
each category you select, filling up each tab with some relevant sample content. Of course, you can customize
([click here]) each tab.
After you've got iGoogle up and running, you can add a new tab when your gadgets start overflowing the home
page or when you want to get organized by grouping related gadgets together:
Click the "Add a tab" link to the right of any existing tabs.
The "Add a tab" box shown in Figure 8-21 opens.
1.
Figure 8-21. To add a new tab, just give it a name. If you want Google to suggest content related to
that name, turn on the "I'm feeling lucky" checkbox.

In the "Tab name" text box, type a name for the new tab. If you want Google to find some gadgets related
to that name and put them on your new tab, turn on the "I'm feeling lucky" checkbox. Click OK.
Google creates your new tab, and opens it. If you turned on the "I'm feeling lucky" checkbox, you've
already got some gadgets in place.
0.
Now you add content ([click here]), delete any gadgets that don't meet your needs ([click here]), and move
stuff around ([click here]) to get your tab looking the way you want it.
8.4.2. Edit a Tab
After you've created a tab, you might want to make some changes to it. You can customize any tab in iGoogle
to your heart's delight.
To edit a tab, click the tab you want to edit, and then click the down arrow next to its name. From the menu
that appears, select "Edit this tab" to open the page shown in Figure 8-22. Here, you can edit these aspects of
the tab:
Figure 8-22. This page shows the various elements you can change on a tab (the bottom part of this

page appears in Figure 8-9).
General:
Language. Choose the language iGoogle uses to communicate with you.
Location. If this tab pertains to a different location than your default, select the country and city (or
U.S. Zip code) here.
Open links in a new tab or browser window. Turn on this checkbox if you want to keep your
current place when you click a link. The link opens in a new tab of your browser (if your browser
supports tabs) or a brand-new window.

NOTE
General settings apply to all the tabs in iGoogle. Content settings apply only to the current
tab.
Content:
Name. To rename a tab, use this text box.
Delete. Clicking this button deletes the current tab and all its contents.
Gadgets. This section lists all gadgets currently on the tab. From here, you can share ([click here])
a gadget or click "Add more gadgets" to put new content on the tab.
Theme. This section lists the name of the tab's current theme. Click "Change theme" to give the tab
a different look.
iGoogle lets you have different themes for different tabs. So, for example, you
can use the no-nonsense Classic theme for work-related tabs, a beach scene
or cityscape for a travel-related tab, and a cool design for a personal
tab—whatever appeals to you.
Layout. As [click here] explains, here's where you change a tab's layout from the standard three
columns.
Troubleshooting/Restore:
Restore your iGoogle page to the last backup. Click Restore Now to go back the last saved
version of your iGoogle page (see [click here]).
Manually back up your iGoogle page. To force Google to save a backup right now, click the
Backup button.
After you've made the edits you want to make, click Save to save your changes.
NOTE

As handy as it would be, you can't currently rearrange the tabs on your iGoogle page. Tabs appear from
left to right in the order you created them.
8.4.3. Share a Tab
Just as you can share individual gadgets ([click here]), you can share an entire tab. Your sharee gets an email
with a link featuring the gadgets and arrangement you've chosen for the tab; with just a few clicks she can add
the tab to her own iGoogle page. Sharing tabs can be helpful when, for example, someone new at work needs
help setting up an iGoogle page to work with Google apps.
Here's how you share a tab:
Click the tab you want to share. Click the drop-down arrow on the tab, and then, from the menu that pops
up, select "Share this tab".
Google opens the "Send [tab name] to a friend" box, shown in Figure 8-23. The top of the box lists the
gadgets you can share, with all their checkboxes turned on.
1.
Figure 8-23. To share a tab, let Google know which gadgets to share, where to send the invitation,
and whether you want to include an optional message. If you want a copy of the invitation email,
turn on the "Send me a copy" checkbox.

If there's a gadget on the tab that you don't want to share, turn off its checkbox. To send the gadgets
complete with your settings (like your Zip code for a weather or movie times gadget), turn on the
checkbox labeled "Send my settings for these gadgets". Type or paste in the email addresses of the
people you want to share with, using commas to separate addresses. If you want, type something in the
Message box, and then click Send.
Google sends out an email with a message that says something like this: "Your friend, [name], has sent
you the following Google Personalized Tab", along with a link.
0.
When a recipient clicks the link, she sees a page like the one in Figure 8-24. When she clicks the big blue "Add
to Google" button, she sees the gadgets as they're arranged on your tab. If she's already signed into her own
Google Account, then Google adds the tab to her iGoogle page. Otherwise, Google invites her to sign in or
create her own account.
Figure 8-24. This is the page people see when they get an invitation to share a tab, and then click
the invitation email's link.

8.4.4. Delete a Tab
To delete a tab, along with all of its content, click the tab so you can see it. Click the down arrow, and then,
from the menu that appears, select "Delete this tab". Confirm that you really want to delete the tab, and there
it goes.
If you somehow deleted the wrong tab by mistake, then you have two ways to get it
back. If you act fast, you can simply undo the deletion. After it's deleted a tab, Google
puts a message box near the top of your iGoogle page, telling you what it's just deleted.
Click Undo to restore the tab. If you don't see that message box, though, you can
restore iGoogle to its last saved version ([click here] tells you how).
 

 
8.5. Making iGoogle Your Home Page
Once you get iGoogle set up just the way you like it, it kinda feels like home. So the next step is making it your
home page. That way, iGoogle is there when you open your Web browser. And if you wander away from
iGoogle, you can get back with a single click. This section explains how to make iGoogle your home page in a
number of different browsers and operating systems.
NOTE
If you've already got classic Google as your home page, you just have to sign in to make iGoogle your
home page.
8.5.1. Safari for Mac OS X
If you use Safari to find your way through the Internet jungle, these easy steps make iGoogle your base camp:
In Safari, select Safari
Preferences.
Safari opens the Preferences window.
1.
Select General (if it's not already selected). Find the Home Page box, and then type www.google.com/ig.
Then, in the window's upper-left corner, click the red close button.
Safari closes the Preferences window, and makes iGoogle your home page.
If Safari is parked at iGoogle when you open the Preferences window, then you
don't have to type in the Web address in step 2. Instead, click the "Set to Current
Page" button. Clicking that button changes your home page to wherever you are
when you click it.
2.
8.5.2. Firefox for Mac OS X
If you're a Mac fan who uses Firefox, it's easy to set your home page:
In Firefox, select Firefox
Preferences.
Firefox opens the Preferences window.
1.
2

Select General (if it's not already selected). Find the Home Page box, and then type in
www.google.com/ig. Then, in the window's upper-left corner, click the red close button.
Firefox closes the Preferences window, and makes iGoogle your home page.
Firefox users (Mac or Windows) can use this simple shortcut to make iGoogle their
home page: Open iGoogle in a Firefox tab, and then drag the tab to the Home
button in your browser's upper left. When you let go of the mouse button, Firefox
shows a confirmation box asking if you want to make the page your new home
page. Click Yes, and you're all set.
2.
8.5.3. Firefox for Windows
In Firefox for Windows, you can use the drag-and-drop trick explained in the previous section, or follow these
steps:
In Firefox, click Tools
Options.
The Options box opens.
1.
Click Main (unless it's already selected). In the Startup section, find the Home Page text box, and then
type in www.google.com/ig. Or, if you're on iGoogle right now, click Use Current Page instead. Click OK.
Firefox closes the Options box, and sets your home page to iGoogle.
2.
8.5.4. Internet Explorer 6
Here's how to set your home page in versions of Internet Explorer up through version 6:
Open Internet Explorer, and then select Tools
Internet Options.
The Internet Options box opens.
1.
You want to be on the General tab. If another tab is selected, click General. In the "Home page" section at
the top of the Internet Options box, into the Address box, type www.google.com/ig. Alternatively, if you're
already on iGoogle, just click Use Current. Then click OK.
IE closes the Internet Options box, and sets your home page to iGoogle.
2.
8.5.5. Internet Explorer 7 and Higher
Some lucky people have second homes. It's not quite the same, but with Internet Explorer 7, you can have
multiple home pages. If you decide to do that, IE displays your different home pages on tabs, so you can easily
click the one you want. Here's how to set iGoogle as your only home page, or one of many:

In Internet Explorer, go to www.google.com/ig (or go to www.google.com, and then, if necessary, click
the upper-right iGoogle link). Once there, on the right side of the Tabs bar, look for the Home button. (Not
surprisingly, the Home button looks like a little house). Click its drop-down arrow.
IE shows the Home Page menu.
1.
Select "Add or Change Home Page".
The "Add or Change Home Page" box opens, showing the current page's Web address (it should be
www.google.com/ig).
2.
What you do in this dialog box depends on whether you want multiple home pages, or just one:
Use this Web page as your only home page. If iGoogle feels like home sweet home and you
don't want any other home page tabs, turn on this radio button.
Add this Web page to your home page tabs. If you like the idea of multiple home pages on
different tabs (or if you have a few different home pages already), turn on this radio button.
Use the current tab set as your home page. This option appears only if you have several tabs
open right now. If you turn on this radio button, then all the tabs you have open will become your
collection of home pages.
When you've turned on the option you want, click Yes.
IE closes the box, and applies the option you chose.
NOTE
Because IE 7 allows multiple home pages, you can easily end up with some home page tabs you
don't want. To remove a home page tab, click the Home button's drop-down arrow, and then
select Remove. From the submenu that flies out, click the name of the tab you want to remove. A
confirmation box appears. Click Yes, and the extra home page is gone.
3.
 

 
8.6. iGoogle and Google Applications
For people who regularly use Gmail, Google Docs, Google Calendar, and other Google offerings, one of the best
things about iGoogle is that it can serve as a control center for checking, viewing, and working with everything
Google.
Figure 8-25 shows an iGoogle page with a number of Google apps gadgets. This gives you an idea of how you
can gather up everything you need in iGoogle.
Figure 8-25. This page brings together Gmail with Google Docs, Talk, and Calendar so you can keep
an eye on all your apps from your iGoogle page.
Here are some of the specific gadgets that can help you stay on top of your Google apps, right from your
iGoogle page:
Google Docs. This gadget gives you one-click access to your active Google Docs documents.
Google Docs: Forms list. If you have any active forms ([click here]) gathering information for a Google
Docs spreadsheet, you can see responses and access forms from this gadget.

Gmail. The Gmail gadget shows recent conversations in your Inbox. Click any message to open it in a new
window, or click Inbox to see your whole inbox. If you need to send an email, click Compose Mail to open
a new window where you can write your message.
Google Talk. This lets you chat right from your iGoogle page using Google Talk. One of the Google Talk
gadget's nice features is that it lets you have group chats ([click here]). You can also pop the chat window
out, so you can keep chatting if you surf away from your iGoogle page ([click here] tells you all about
using the Google Talk gadget).
Google Calendar. Keep track of your appointments (as well as the fun stuff) right from iGoogle with this
gadget.
You can use tons of other helpful gadgets, such as Google Map Search, Google Bookmarks (to keep all your
bookmarks online, rather than on your computer), dictionary gadgets, calculator gadgets, and more. In fact,
look around your desk. Whatever you have there to help you do your job—from reference books to sticky
notes—you can probably find a virtual equivalent among iGoogle's gadgets.
 

 
Chapter 9. One-Click Web Design with Page Creator
If you've ever wanted to create your own Web page, but were intimidated by the thought of having to learn
HTML (the language of Web pages), Page Creator is for you. Google's Page Creator lets you quickly create a
professional-looking Web page and publish it to the Web with a single click—no HTML know-how required.
Page Creator is still under development, and isn't yet in a league with some other Web page creators, like the
ones offered by Yahoo, PageBreeze, and Doteasy. So why try Page Creator? For one thing, you can manage it
from your Google Account. Page Creator also has some nice features, like autosaving so you don't lose any
changes. And if you've never created a Web site before, the very simplicity of Page Creator makes it super easy
to learn. Plus, creating and publishing Web sites with Page Creator is free—it costs you nothing, zilch,
nada—and you just can't argue with that.
NOTE
Page Creator is likely to undergo many changes as Google works on it. So some of the figures and
instructions in this chapter may be out of date by the time you start working with Page Creator. The
good news is that Google wants to hear your feedback about Page Creator to help make it better. The
Tip on [click here] tells you how to add your two cents.
9.1. Getting Started with Page Creator
Before you try Page Creator, make sure that you've got the right setup. You can use Page Creator from any
computer that has an Internet connection and meets these requirements:
Windows XP or Vista. Use Internet Explorer 6 or higher, or Firefox version 1.5 or higher.
Mac OS X. Use Firefox 1.5 or higher.
Linux. Firefox 1.5 or higher.
It's always a good idea to have the latest version of your Web browser. Get the
newest edition of Firefox at www.firefox.com. For Internet Explorer, visit
www.microsoft.com/ie.
To create Web pages with Page Creator, you need a Gmail account (not just a Google Account). So if you
haven't yet signed up for Gmail, pop over to Chapter 5, which shows you how to create an account.

Once you've got all the prerequisites take care of, head to www.pages.google.com, and sign in with your Gmail
user name and password. The first time you do, you see a welcome page like the one in Figure 9-1. Near the
bottom of the page is a box containing Google's Terms and Conditions for using Page Creator. Take a minute to
read these, so you know what you're signing up for. Here are some of the highlights:
Figure 9-1. The first time you sign into Page Creator, Google welcomes you with a screen like this
one. The bottom of the page (not shown) contains Google's terms and conditions for using Page
Creator. After you've read them, turn on the checkbox to signal you agree, and then click the "I'm
ready to create my pages" link (circled) or button to get started.
You have to be old enough to agree to a contract (in the U.S., that's at least 18).
You're responsible for keeping your password confidential, and you'll let Google know immediately if your
password leaks out. This condition is important because you're responsible for everything that goes on in
your account—even if someone else is doing them. (For tips on creating a secure password, see the box
on [click here].)
You're responsible for the content of your Web pages, and you agree not to break any copyright or
decency laws.
You agree to let Google know, through your site settings ([click here]), if your site contains adult content.

If you're outside the United States, you agree to comply with your local laws and regulations.
You agree to Google's privacy policy. (The box on [click here] outlines this policy.) Note that Google may
share your account info with law enforcement agencies if required to do so.
You won't steal Google's intellectual property (that's Page Creator) in any way—you'll just use Page
Creator through this site.
You own the stuff on the Web pages you create with Page Creator; Google doesn't claim any ownership or
control of your content.
When you've read the terms, turn on the checkbox labeled "I have read and agree to these Terms and
Conditions", and then click the "I'm ready to create my pages" link or button.
Up to Speed: Web Page? Web Site? What's the Difference?
In casual conversation, you may hear people use the terms Web page and Web site
interchangeably. These terms are different, though, and as you learn to create your own Web
pages, it's helpful to keep that distinction in mind.
A Web page is a single document that people can view on the Web. Each Web page has its own
unique Web address, or URL, which tells computers where it lives within a Web site.
A Web site is a set of related Web pages collected under a higher-level Web address. For example,
your Web site will have an address like this one: http://YourSite.googlepages.com. All the pages
within your site start with that address, but each page adds a bit more info to give its specific
location within the site, such as http://YourSite.googlepages.com/home or
http://YourSite.googlepages.com/photos. The address for the Web site is like a street name, and
the addresses for individual pages are like the house numbers on that street.
Another helpful analogy: Think of the Web site as a magazine, and each Web page as a page in
that magazine. The magazine (the Web site) gathers together individual pages (the Web pages) to
present a complete package.
One more term you'll hear when you're creating a Web site is home page. This is your Web site's
main page, the page that opens when someone types in the Web address to visit your site. Often,
a site's home page introduces what the site's about, and provides a menu of links that serves as a
table of contents to the site.
 

 
Chapter 9. One-Click Web Design with Page Creator
If you've ever wanted to create your own Web page, but were intimidated by the thought of having to learn

9.2. Creating Your First Web Page
The first time you open Page Creator, Google takes you straight to Page Editor, shown in Figure 9-2, so you can
start right in on creating your Web page. For your first page, Google picks a random design template ([click
here]) from its collection, so what you see probably looks different from Figure 9-2. This helps give you an idea
of what your first page could look like, but the template Google chooses may not be what you want—maybe
that bright pink header isn't quite right for your horror movie site. Not to worry—you can change the template
(Page Creator calls it the "look"), with a couple of clicks, as [click here] explains.
Figure 9-2. Page Editor is where you work on the pages that make up your Web site. Click inside any
section to add text, using the formatting toolbar to make it look good. To change a page's template
or layout, click the Change Look or Change Layout links (circled right), respectively. As you work,
you can take a sneak peek at how the page is shaping up by clicking the Preview link (circled left). If
you're done for now, click the upper-left "Back to Site Manager" link. To publish your page on the
Web, click the Publish button.
Page Editor divides each Web page into these sections, from top to bottom:
Title. The title goes in the page's header and lets viewers know what the page is about.
Subtitle. This optional section also goes in the page's header.

Content. The meat and potatoes of your page.
Footer. Footers, which are optional, often contain copyright information, a Contact Us link, or links to
important pages within the site, like policies, Home, About Us, and so on ([click here] tells you how to add
links to your site).
You can tinker with the page's layout—[click here] tells you how.
To get started with your Web page, click any of the sections (they all invite you to "Click here"), and then start
typing. Page Creator saves your page automatically as you work, so you don't have to worry about losing any
changes. To see how your page is shaping up, click the upper-left Preview link. When the page looks good, click
the Publish button to put your page on the Web ([click here]).
Gem in the Rough: Page Creator Discussion Group
Because it's still under development, Page Creator is a work in progress. Its Help files aren't as
complete as you might hope—and some of the answers there are outdated. As you work on
creating and refining your Web page, though, you do have a resource for getting expert help: the
Page Creator Discussion Group.
To find the group, click the upper-right Discuss link (you can see it in Figure 9-2), which opens the
Page Creator Discussion Group in a new window. Anyone can browse the posts there, but to ask a
question (or answer one), you have to join the group. To do that, click the right-hand "Join this
group" link. The Join page asks you to provide a nickname for use in the group and set
subscription preferences for the different forums within the group. You can subscribe to posts (so
they arrive in your Gmail Inbox) or read the group only on the Web (the No Email option). When
you've chosen a nickname and set your preferences, click the "Join this group" button.
The Page Creator Discussion Group has seven forums:
How to for Beginners. This is a great place to ask questions when you're just getting
started with Page Creator.
How to for Advanced Users. If you've got some experience creating Web pages and want
to know how to get Page Creator to do some of your favorite tricks, check here.
Something is Broken. When Page Creator isn't working the way it's supposed to, report it
to the Google Page Creator team here.
Suggestions and Ideas. Since Google is still developing Page Creator, they want to hear
your feedback.

Experimental Features. Currently, this forum is read-only (meaning you can't post
anything to it), because Google removed certain experimental features it was trying out in
Page Creator.
Share your site. Once you've published your site, you can post in this thread and ask other
group members to give you feedback. (Don't forget to include your URL in your post, so
people can find your site!)
Pages. This forum is for posting specific questions about your page or providing help to
other Page Creator users. If your post in this forum doesn't offer or request help, Google
removes it.
Sometimes, getting help from a peer is the best way to solve a problem. Like all online
forums, though, this one can be a little hit-and-miss. You may have to wait a bit for an
answer, or ask again if your question doesn't grab anyone's attention. Still, the Page Creator
Discussion Group is the next best thing to having a Web guru looking over your shoulder as
you create your site.
 

 
9.3. Site Manager
As its name implies, Site Manager is where you oversee your Web site as it develops. And, if you create more
than one site ([click here]), you manage those sites from here, too.
To get to Site Manager from Page Editor, click the upper-left "Back to Site Manager" link. Or, if you've signed
out of Page Creator, sign in, and Google takes you directly to Site Manager. However you get there, you can
easily find your way around Site Manager (Figure 9-3). Here's a quick tour:
Site Manager. In bold at the top of the page is the Web address of your site, which looks something like
this: http://<YourGmailID>.googlepages.com, with your Gmail user name (the part of your email address
before @google.com) in place of <YourGmailID>.
Figure 9-3. As you create pages for your Web site, Site Manager helps you keep track of them.
Your site's home page shows a picture of a house (circled).
Create a new site. Google will host up to three sites for your Page Creator account. Click this link to start
a new site, and then jump over to [click here] to read about creating a site.
NOTE

If you have more than one site in your Page Creator account, the "Create a new site" link changes
to a drop-down list, labeled "Choose another site".
Publish. Select one or more pages by turning on their upper-left checkboxes, and then click this button to
put your page on the Web.
More Actions. This drop-down list has the following options, which are discussed in detail later in this
chapter:
Tell your friends ([click here])
Discard unpublished changes ([click here])
Unpublish ([click here])
Duplicate ([click here])
Delete ([click here])
All/None. Select or deselect all the pages in Site Manager by clicking one of these links.
View as. You can see your pages either in a grid (as in Figure 9-3) or a list (as in Figure 9-4).
Figure 9-4. When you display Site Manager in List view, you don't see little pictures for each
page. What you get is each page's name and status (published or unpublished), its Web
address, and when it was last edited. (Your site's home page shows the word "Homepage" after
its Web address.)

Sort. As your Web site accumulates new pages, Site Manager can get pretty full displaying them all. You
can sort pages alphabetically by name or by most recent edit. If you're in List view, you can also sort
pages by status (published or unpublished) and URL (Web address).
Create a new page. Click this link to get started on a new page for your site. (Don't confuse this link
with the upper-right "Create a new site" link, which makes a whole new site.)
Existing pages. As you create new pages for your site, they appear in the main section of Site Manager
(the middle part of Figure 9-3), listed by name. Click a page's name to open it in Page Editor (Figure 9-2).
Site settings. Click this link (and read the next section) to fine-tune Page Creator's settings.
Pages with unpublished changes. If you're editing pages on your site, this section lets you know how
many of your pages have edits that you haven't yet published online. Click the "publish all changes" link to
put all your edits on the Web ([click here] tells you more about editing pages).
Uploaded stuff. Any files you've uploaded, including image and HTML files, appear in this list, which
shows the uploaded files' names and sizes.
NOTE
Page Creator can upload only files that are 10 MB or smaller, and it can store up to 100 MB of
uploaded files total. (That includes the pages you've created.)

9.3.1. Adjust Your Site's Settings
Page Creator lets you tweak a number of settings for your Web site. In Site Manager, click the right-hand "Site
settings" link to open the Settings page, shown in Figure 9-5 and explained below:
Figure 9-5. Page Creator's Settings page is where you make adjustments that apply to your whole
site.
Site name. This is what appears in a browser's title bar (way at the very top of the browser window)
when somebody looks at your page. Google fills in this box with your Gmail user name, but you can
change it to anything you like.
If you don't want site visitors to figure out your Gmail address and email you, then
consider changing your site name. You can also protect your Gmail address by
creating a second or third site ([click here]) that doesn't include your Gmail user
name in the URL.
Site URL. The URL is your site's address on the Web. The information in this section is FYI, so you can

share it with others, create links from your blog or another site, and so on.
Home page. You can choose any page in your site to be the site's home page, the page that opens when
someone visits your site. From this drop-down list, select the page you want.
Image upload. This checkbox, which is automatically turned on (unless you turn it off), shortens the time
it takes to transfer files to Page Creator by reducing the size of images you upload. (This doesn't reduce
the image's quality.)
Adult content. If your site is inappropriate for the under-21 crowd, turn on this checkbox so Google can
help make sure that kids can't find it.
Hide this site. If your site isn't quite ready for prime time, you can hide it so that nobody but you can
see it.
After you've done your tweaking, click the "Back to Site Manager" link to save the new settings.
In Site Manager, click the Give Us Feedback link to open a page where you can share
your suggestions with Google's Page Creator team. You can also offer feedback by
joining the Page Creator Discussion Group (see the box on [click here]) and posting your
thoughts in the Suggestions and Ideas forum (a Google employee, called the Google
Page Creator Guide, monitors discussions there).
 

 
9.4. Editing and Designing Web Pages
After you've created a page, you can adjust it in various ways and create more pages to keep it company. This
section explains how to design and edit the pages that make up your Web site—from creating a new page, to
controlling how it looks, to working with text, images, and gadgets. For such a simple Web page editor, you'll be
blown away by all you can do with Page Creator.
9.4.1. Adding New Pages
Not many Web sites consist of just one page. As you work on your site, you'll think of ways to divide its
information into categories. And a good way to organize your site is to create a page for each category. For
example, your personal Web page might have a welcome page, a page with family photos, a page with info
about your profession or hobbies, and so on.
To create a new page, go to Site Manager (in Page Editor, click the upper-left "Back to Site Manager" link) and
click the left-hand "Create a New Page" link. Page Creator asks for the page's title. Type it into the text box, and
then click the "Create and Edit" button. Page Creator does what it does best—creates the page and opens it in
the Page Editor.
If you create a page in a different program, such as Front Page, you can get that page onto your site by
uploading its HTML file (see [click here]).
NOTE
Your Google-hosted Web site can have up to 500 pages. That's a lot of content!
9.4.1.1. Duplicate a page
If you want to use an existing page as the starting point for a new page—for example, say you want to copy a
menu of links instead of recreating it—go to Site Manager ([click here]). Find the page you want to copy, and
then turn on its upper-left checkbox. Then, from the More Actions drop-down, select Duplicate. Page Creator
whips up an exact copy of the page, and then adds it to the existing page list.
You can rename the copy by opening it in Page Editor, and then changing its title. The
title that appears on a page doubles as its name in Site Manager.
9.4.2. Using Templates and Layouts
As top chefs, designers, and salespeople will tell you, it's all about presentation. Page Creator's predesigned
templates and layouts let you present your Web pages' content with clarity and flair.
9.4.2.1. Choose a template

In order to help ensure that the pages on your site are professional-looking and present a unified look, Google
supplies you with templates—predesigned page blueprints that control things like background design, color
scheme, fonts, and so on. In Site Manager, when you click "Create a New Page", Google creates the page. From
there, you can apply a template. You can also change a page's existing template at any time. You can use
multiple templates for your site, or one template for all your site's pages. (If you want your site to have a
unified look, stick with a single template.)
To select a template for your Web page, open the page in Page Editor (in Site Manager, click the name of the
page you want to open), and then click the upper-right Change Look link. Page Editor opens the Choose Look
page, shown in Figure 9-6.
Figure 9-6. The Choose Look page shows Page Creator's predesigned templates. This black-and-
white image doesn't show the range of colors available, but there are lots. Click a template's
Preview link to see an example of the template in action; click a template to apply it to your page-in-
progress.
Use the Choose Look page to browse through several dozen templates. To see how a template looks as a Web
page, click its Preview link to open a Google-designed sample page, like the one shown in Figure 9-7. To apply a
template to your page, on the Choose Look page, click the template's picture. Page Creator applies the template
and returns you to Page Editor. If the template you chose isn't quite right, click Choose Look again to try
another.

Figure 9-7. Previewing a template gives you an idea of how the template looks on an actual Web
page. This is the preview for the Lines Landscape template. As you preview templates, you can learn
more than you ever wanted to know about flannel (all the previews use this content).
After you've applied a new template, click Page Editor's upper-left Preview link to see
how the template looks with your page's content.
9.4.2.2. Apply a template to all pages
The whole point of a template is to give your site's pages a unified, coherent look. In Page Creator, the template
you apply to your home page gets applied to all subsequent pages in the site. (Usually, the first page you make
in Page Creator is your site's home page, but as [click here] explains, you can make any page the home page.)
It's a good idea to get your home page set up in a way you like early on, because any new pages you create will
use the same template and layout (explained next) as your home page.

NOTE
A site's home page controls the layout of pages created after that page becomes the home page.
Designating a page a site's home page ([click here]) doesn't affect the layout of existing pages.
9.4.2.3. Choose a layout
A template determines your page's design; a layout arranges its content. Page Creator has four different layouts
from which to choose. To change a page's layout, in Page Editor, click the upper-right Change Layout link to
open the Choose Layout page, shown in Figure 9-8.
Figure 9-8. The Choose Layout page has four options for laying out your content. The current layout
of your page is highlighted (here, it's the layout called "2 Columns - Left" in the middle of the top
row).
Your layout options are:
1 Column. The main content of the page appears in a single wide column, like a page in a book.
2 Columns - Left. This layout gives you two content areas: a narrow column on the left and a wide one

on the right.
2 Columns - Right. This layout puts the wide column on the left and the narrow one on the right.
3 Columns. Your content appears in three columns. The middle column is wider than those to its left and
right.
To apply a layout to your page, just click the layout you want. Page Creator takes you back to Page Editor,
where your page appears in its new layout. If you don't like how it looks, just pick another layout.
To make your site easy to navigate, use a two-columns layout, putting links ([click
here]) in the narrow column.
9.4.3. Formatting Text
To put text on your page, you just click inside a text area—the boxes where you can put the title, subtitle, main
content, or footer—and then start typing. But as you work on your site, you probably want to spiff up your text
in various ways. To do that, head to the top of the editing area, where you see the formatting bar (Figure 9-9).
Here's a quick tour:
Undo/Redo. Standard buttons when you want to reverse the action you just took.
Figure 9-9. As in any text editor, format text by selecting it, and then clicking a button on the
Formatting toolbar.

Image. Click this button when you want to insert an image on your page. Page Creator brings up a box
where you can specify the image file you want to add; [click here] has more on adding images.
NOTE
Simply select the text you want to format, and then click any of these buttons to format the text.
Link. Select some text, and then click this button to turn text into a link to another Web page ([click
here]).
Heading. This button offers a variety of sizes and styles for your page's headings, which divide the main
content area of the page into sections and subsections:
Heading. Use this for a major section of your page. It's like a chapter title in a book.
Subheading. A subheading works like a section within a chapter.
Minor Heading. Use a minor heading for any subsections.

Normal. This is for plain ol' text, the kind you'd find in a paragraph.
Bold.
Italic.
Text color. You may be perfectly happy with a template's preset text colors. But if you want to change
the color of a particular word or phrase, click this button, and then select from the palette that appears.
Background color. Click this button to highlight text with a contrasting color.
Font. Page Creator offers a limited selection of fonts:
Times New Roman
Arial
Courier New
Georgia
Trebuchet
Verdana
You can apply a font that's not on Page Creator's list by editing the page's
HTML ([click here]).
Size. The options here are Small, Normal, Large, and Huge.
Numbered/bulleted list. Click one of these buttons to organize your text into a list.
Increase/decrease indent. Increasing the indent is useful when you want to create sub-bullets in a
bulleted list.
Alignment buttons. Your text can be left-aligned, centered, or right-aligned.

9.4.3.1. Add a link
Most Web pages contain links to other Web pages—it's what makes surfing the Web so much fun. You can link
to any of the following:
Other pages within your own site. For example, you can create a table of contents to help viewers find
their way around your site.
Other Web sites. If you know an interesting or relevant site you want to direct your readers to, then link
to its Web address.
Files you've uploaded. If you've uploaded a picture of your adorable new puppy, for example, you can
create a link that opens the picture in a new browser window.
Your email address. This option creates a mailto link. When someone clicks the link, their email program
opens a Compose Mail window, with your email address already in the To field.
To insert a link, select the text that you want to transform into a link. Then click the Link button to open the Edit
Link box, shown in Figure 9-10.
Figure 9-10. From the list on the left (circled), choose the kind of link you want to create. The Edit
Link box changes to gather the info it needs to create that kind of link.
In the Edit Link box, the "Text to display" field shows the text you've chosen to hold the link. In the "Link to"
section, choose the kind of link you want to insert: one to a page within your site, a file you've uploaded to Page
Creator, a Web address, or an email address. The kind of link you choose determines the info Page Creator asks
for:
Your pages. As you can see in Figure 9-10, the Edit Link box displays a list of all the pages in your site.
Click one to select it. Or, if you want to create a whole new page to link to, type its name in the "Create
new page" text box, and then click the Add Page button.

Your files. When you turn on this radio button, the Edit Link box lists all the files you've uploaded to Page
Creator ([click here]). If you don't see the file you want on the list, you can upload it from the Edit Link
box; click Browse to find and upload the file.
Web address. Type or paste in the URL (Web address) of the site you want to link to. (A good way to get
the URL correct is to open another browser window, surf over to the site, and then copy what's in its
address bar. Then head back to the Edit Link box, and paste it in there.) To be sure you didn't make a
typo in the URL, click "Test this link". Your browser opens a new window, showing the Web page the URL
points to. If it's the wrong page, or you get an error, check the URL, and then try again.
Email address. Type or paste in your email address so visitors to your site can contact you.
When you've told Page Creator what you want to link to, click OK. Page Creator inserts the link, and then takes
you back to Page Editor.
9.4.3.2. Change or remove a link
After you've added a link, you can edit or remove it—for example, if you've changed your pages around so the
old link doesn't work, or a site you linked to has disappeared from the Web. In Page Editor, click the link you
want to change. A box like the one in Figure 9-11 pops up, giving you several options for working with that link
(the contents of the box depend on the kind of link you clicked):
Figure 9-11. When you click a link in Page Editor, Google presents you with some options for
working with that link. The options vary according to the kind of link you click, but all of them have
Change and Remove.

Go to link. Click the link to check whether the link works the way it should. (This option doesn't appear
for mailto links.)
Change. This option opens the Edit Link box you saw in Figure 9-10, so you can make your changes.
Edit page. If you linked to a page within your site, this option opens the linked page in the Page Editor.
Remove. This option deletes the link but leaves the text that was linked.
Make a selection, or, in the box's upper-right, click the little X to close it.
9.4.4. Add an Image
To make a Web page eye-catching, add images. Graphics draw the eye and help break up long stretches of text.
Adding an image takes just a couple of steps:

In the Page Editor, open a page, and then put your cursor approximately where you want the image to
appear. Then click the Image button.
The "Add an Image" box, shown in Figure 9-12, opens. This box give you two ways of adding an image to
your page:
Uploaded images. If you've uploaded images to Page Creator, you see them here. If you want to add a
new image, click the Browse button, find and select the image on your computer, click Open, and Google
uploads the image. When the image appears in the "Add an Image" box, click it, and then click the Add
Image button to add it to your page.
Web address (URL). If your image is hosted on a Web site, enter its URL here.
Figure 9-12. In the left-hand menu (circled), choose how you're going to add an image.
When you select Uploaded Images, pictures you've uploaded appear in the main part of
the "Add an Image" box. If you don't see the image you want, click Browse to upload a
new one. Once it's done uploading, click it, and then click Add Image, and Google puts
the image on your page.
1.
Choose an uploaded image or supply a URL, and then click the Add Image button.
Page Creator inserts the image into your page.
2.
After you've added an image, drag it to move it around the page.
9.4.4.1. Edit an image
Sometimes, an image doesn't look quite the way you want it to. No problem—you can edit it. In Page Editor,

click the image you want to edit. In the little blue box that appears, click "Edit image" to bring up the Edit
Image box (Figure 9-13), which helps you get your picture looking just right.
Figure 9-13. Here's where you can change an image's size or orientation, crop it, and adjust various
settings.
In the Edit Image box, you can play around with these settings:
Size. The far-left drop-down list has different sizes to choose from: Small, Medium, Large, and Original
Size. Choose one of these, or select Custom and set the image's height and width (in pixels) yourself.
Usually, making a large image smaller doesn't hurt its quality, but it doesn't work the other way around. If
you try to make a small picture bigger, it often looks blurry or pixelated (like it's just a bunch of little
squares).
Rotate. If you need to flip an image around, click one of these buttons (they look like curly arrows) to
rotate it counterclockwise or clockwise, 90 degrees at a time.
Crop. To focus on a particular area of an image, you can cut out unnecessary or distracting stuff. Click
Crop, and the Edit Image box changes to look like the one in Figure 9-14. The edges of the image are
blacked out to show what Google will cut off, and square handles appear at the image's new border. Click
and drag a handle to resize the crop area. Or put your cursor between two handles, so the cursor becomes
a four-way arrow, and then drag the crop area to move it around on the image. When the crop area looks
good, click Crop To Selection.
Figure 9-14. To move the crop area to a different part of the image, hover your cursor over the edge

of the crop area so it becomes a four-way arrow (as shown here), and then drag to move the crop
rectangle. The little square handles around the crop area let you resize the crop. To go back to the
Edit Image box without cropping, click Cancel Crop (circled). To quit editing the image and go back
to Page Editor, click the lower-right Cancel button.
Slider. In the Edit Image box's right, the slider works in conjunction with several different settings, which
you can choose from the drop-down list to its left:
Brightness. Move the slider right to brighten the image, left to darken it.
Enhance. This setting tries to improve the overall appearance of your image. It may or may not do
much.
Grayscale. As you move the slider to the right, color images go from full color to black and white.
Sharpen. The slider doesn't make an out-of-focus image suddenly appear crystal clear, but it can
sharpen up digital images a bit. Move the slider to the right to sharpen.
Mash-up. This setting adds some fun to your photo by layering it with another image. When you
select Mash-up from the drop-down list, some images preselected by Google appear that you can
combine with the photo you're editing. Move the slider to the right to make the overlaid image more
opaque, or to the left to make it more transparent. Figure 9-15 gives you an idea of what a mashed-
up image looks like.
If you've moved the slider around, and want to go back to square one and start over, click the Reset link
to its right to put the slider back in its original position for whatever setting (Brightness, Grayscale, and so
on) you're working with now.

Figure 9-15. Use the mash-up setting to superimpose a design on your image. Here, the circled
design gets put on top of the edited photo. (The effect is more dramatic in color.) Moving the slider
makes the overlaid design more transparent or opaque.
When you're done editing your image, click OK.
9.4.4.2. Remove an image
Zapping an image from your page is easy. Just click the image and, in the blue box that appears, click Remove.
The image disappears from your page, but it's still in the list of images you've uploaded to Page Creator.
NOTE
When you edit or remove an image on a published Web page, you have to republish the page ([click
here]) for the changes to take effect on the Web.
9.4.4.3. Delete an image from Page Creator
When you remove an image from a Web page, that image stays in Page Creator's "Add an Image" box and your
"Uploaded stuff" list. To completely delete an image from Page Creator, go to Site Manager ([click here]). In the
right-hand "Uploaded stuff" list, find the image you want to delete, and then click the little picture of a trash can
to its right. Page Creator asks you to confirm that you really want to trash the file. Click OK, and it's gone.

9.4.5. Adding Gadgets
A gadget is a mini-program you can insert in a Web page. If you've created an iGoogle page (Chapter 8), you
know how fun and useful Google gadgets can be. Google gadgets can show the current time, give up-to-the-
minute sports scores, display news headlines or local weather, put games or an MP3 player on your page—and a
whole lot more. Page Creator makes it super easy to put a gadget or two in your Web pages. Here's how:
In Page Editor, click the bottom-right "add gadget" link.
The "Add a gadget to your page" box shown in Figure 9-16 opens.
1.
Figure 9-16. Search for a specific gadget using the search box, or browse through the categories on
the left. To preview a gadget, click it.
Browse for gadgets by clicking the categories in the left-hand menu or the "more" link in the lower right,
or use the search box to find something specific. When you find a gadget you like, click it.
The "Setup your gadget" box, shown in Figure 9-17, opens.
0.
Adjust the size of the gadget to fit the space you've assigned it on your page.
As you make adjustments, the gadget changes in the Preview window.
1.

If your gadget needs more info from you, fill it in.
2.
When you're done, click OK.
Page Creator adds the gadget to your page.
3.
Figure 9-17. Before you add a gadget to your page, set it up by adjusting its size. Certain gadgets
also require more information, depending on what they do. For example, a local weather gadget
needs to know your location, while a newsfeed gadget may ask how many headlines you want to
display.
Now you can drag the gadget to a new location, or click it, and then select "Edit" to reopen the "Setup your
gadget" box. To remove a gadget, click the gadget, and then, in the blue box that appears, click the Remove
Gadget link.
When you add a gadget to your page, the way the gadget looks in Page Editor isn't
necessarily how it'll look on your published page. To get a better sense of how your
gadget looks, preview the page ([click here]). If necessary, edit the gadget, and then
preview the page again.
9.4.6. Previewing Your Page
Page Editor gives you an idea of how things are shaping up, but it doesn't show you exactly what your published
page will look like. To see how your page would look if published right now, click Page Editor's upper-left
Preview link. Your page's preview opens in a new window. When you're done checking it out, you can close the
window and get back to work in Page Editor.

It's a good idea to close the preview page when you're done with it. The next time you
click Preview, another new window opens (and then another, and then another, and so
on). If you preview a lot, all those slightly different preview windows can get confusing.
It's a good idea to see how your Web page looks in a few different Web browsers—Internet Explorer, Firefox,
Safari, and so on—to make sure it looks good no matter what browser visitors are using. Enlist a friend's help if
necessary.
9.4.7. Editing a Page's HTML
Do you think in tags? Do angle brackets float through your dreams? If you're an HTML wiz, you can edit your
page's HTML (short for "hypertext markup language"). Click the section of the page you want to edit, and then
click Page Editor's bottom-right "edit html" link. Page Creator's HTML editor opens, as shown in Figure 9-18.
Figure 9-18. This is the HTML for a page header. If the text on this page looks like gobbledygook to
you, click Cancel to go back to Page Editor. But if you know some HTML, you can edit the code shown
in this box. Turn on the Preview radio button at the top of the box to switch to the Preview tab
(circled), where you can see what your page looks like after your edits. When you're done editing,
click the Update button (also circled). To discard your edits, click the Cancel button.
For a great primer on HTML—and an easy-to-follow guide to creating and editing Web
pages—check out Creating Web Sites: The Missing Manual by Matthew MacDonald
(O'Reilly, 2005).
Knowing a little HTML can really beef up the Web pages you create in Page Creator. Because Google Labs is still
developing Page Creator, it's a little basic as Web page editors go. So do-it-yourself HTML editing can take a
simple Page Creator page and give it some oomph.

If you have questions about working with HTML in Page Creator, the Page Creator
Discussion Group is a great place to ask them. Lots of friendly, knowledgeable folks are
waiting there to help you out. The box on [click here] tells you how to find and sign up
for the group.
9.4.7.1. Upload an HTML page
If you write HTML in a text editor, like Notepad or TextEdit, or if you've exported a Google Docs document as
HTML ([click here]), then you can upload the HTML page into Page Creator. In Site Manager ([click here]), click
the right-hand "upload" link, browse to the file you want to upload, and then click OK. Page Creator uploads
your file and adds it to the "Uploaded stuff" list. To add that page to your site, use Page Editor's link command
([click here]) to add a link to the file.
9.4.8. Saving a Page
If you've used other Google programs like Docs, you know that Google is fanatical about saving your work for
you. Page Creator is no different: It saves your changes every few minutes, so you don't need to worry about
losing all your hard work. When you're working in Page Editor and navigate away from it (say, to go to Site
Manager), Page Creator saves your changes before it makes the move.
To see when Page Creator last saved your page, look in the Page Editor's upper-right, next to the formatting
toolbar, as shown in Figure 9-19.
Figure 9-19. You never have to worry about saving your work—Page Creator does it for you
automatically. The time in the upper right (circled) tells you when Page Creator last saved.
9.4.8.1. Revert to the published version
Web designers like to tinker. After you've published a page on the Web, you may want to go back and play with
it—edit its layout, insert an image or gadget, try a different template, whatever. Page Creator doesn't update
the live version of your site until you publish the changes, so you can experiment to your heart's content
without messing up your published site.
As you experiment, though, Page Creator saves those edits. So when you open an edited page in Page Editor,
you don't see the current published version; you see one that includes changes you made. If you want to drop

those changes and go back to the current published version—whether to stick with the published version or start
editing again from scratch—go to Site Manager. There, find the page whose edits you want to undo, and then
turn on its upper-left checkbox to select it. From the More Actions drop-down list, select "Discard unpublished
changes". Page Creator scraps the changes you made, taking the page back to the currently published version.
If you publish changes to a page, and then decide you want to go back to the previous
published version, Page Creator can't help you. Instead, check the temporary Internet
files that your browser saves. Internet Explorer stores temporary Internet files in a
directory aptly named Temporary Internet Files. To find where Firefox puts temporary
files, open Firefox, and, in the address bar, type about:cache?device=disk, and then hit
Enter. In the page that opens, look under Cache Directory to find the file path.
9.4.9. Deleting a Page
To remove a page from your site, go to Site Manager, and then turn on the checkbox next to the page you want
to ax. From the More Actions menu, select Delete. Page Creator displays a confirmation box asking whether you
really want to delete the page. Click OK to get rid of the page.
 

 
9.5. Publishing a Web Page
It's not a Web page until it's on the Web. Whether you've just created a site or made some changes to an
existing one, you have to publish your site to make it live on the Internet.
There are two ways to publish a page from Page Creator:
From Page Editor. When you've finished creating or editing a page and you're ready to publish it, click
the upper-left Publish button. Page Creator publishes the page, and displays a box offering you two
choices:
View it on the Web. Click this link to see your newly published page.
Tell your friends. This link offers an easy way to share ([click here]) the page you just put on the
Internet.
From Site Manager. Site Manager gives you a handy way to publish a whole bunch of pages all at once.
Turn on the checkboxes of the pages you want to publish, and then click the upper-left Publish button. In
a flash, Page Creator publishes the pages you chose. In Site Manager, each published page now has a
"View on the Web" link below its name, as Figure 9-20 shows. Click the link to see your published page.
You can publish all recent changes to your site with just one click. In Site Manager,
look on the right-hand side for a section that shows how many pages in your site
have unpublished changes. (Figure 9-20 shows an example.) Click "Publish all
changes" to update your Web site with all the changes you've made.
Figure 9-20. When you've published a page on the Web, Site Manager adds a link (circled, left) you
can click to view that page on the Web. To publish all the edits you've made since the last published
version, click "Publish all changes" (circled, right).

When you publish a Web page, people can view your site on their cellphones and other
mobile devices. Cool.
9.5.1. Sharing a Web Page
So you've published a page explaining your philosophy of life or displaying your wedding photos. The next step
is to tell your friends where to find it. Page Creator offers a way to invite others to view your Web page, but at
this writing it doesn't work (and hasn't for several months). Here's how it's supposed to work: In Site Manager,
select the page you want to share by turning on its checkbox. From the More Actions list, choose "Tell your
friends". A box opens that's supposed to let you enter your friends' email addresses and an optional message,
and then send out invitations. Currently, the box shows a bunch of HTML instead. Go ahead and try this
method—by the time you read this, Google may have fixed the problem.
An alternative—which is just as easy, anyway—is to open your published Web page in a browser. From the
address bar, copy its address, and then write your own email to your friends, pasting in the page's address.

Frequently Asked Question: Traffic Jam
Google told me that my site exceeded its bandwidth limit. What does that mean, and how can I
get my site back up?
A bandwidth limit is the maximum amount of traffic a Web site can handle. (In the online world,
traffic refers to the number of people visiting a site, and how often they download its pages.)
Google sets your site's bandwidth limit (more on that in a sec). When traffic at your site goes past
that limit, your site becomes temporarily unavailable so no one can get to it. When traffic drops
below the limit, your site becomes accessible again.
So how much traffic is too much? At the moment, Google won't say. There is a bandwidth limit for
Page Creator sites, but Google isn't spilling the beans about what that limit is. The only way you
know if you've crossed it is if you get that Exceeded Bandwidth Limit message. If that happens to
you, don't feel bad—your site's just too darned popular!
9.5.2. Hiding a Published Web Page
If you've published some pages but don't want anyone to see them just yet—maybe your site is still under
construction—you can hide the site. Do so from the Settings page:
Go to Site Manager. (If you have more than one site, make sure you're in the site you want to hide by
selecting it from the upper-right drop-down list.) In the upper right, click the "Site settings" link.
The Settings page (Figure 9-5) opens.
1.
In the "Hide this site" section at the bottom of the page, turn on the checkbox labeled "Make pages in this
site unavailable to the public". Then click the upper-left "Back to Site Manager" link to head back to Site
Manager.
Site Manager now displays a message reminding you that the site's hidden, as shown in Figure 9-21.
Figure 9-21. When you've hidden a site, Site Manager lets you know (circled). Click the
"Edit site settings" link or the right-hand "Site settings" link to unhide the site.
2.

You can edit a hidden site, but nobody (including you) can view it on the Web (you can only see it in Page
Creator). If you try, you get a page displaying the dreaded "404 File Not Found" error.
Before you can publish the changes you make to a hidden site, you have to unhide it. To unhide it, go back to
the Settings page (in Site Manager, click the "Site settings" link), and then turn off the "Make pages in this site
unavailable to the public" checkbox. Your site is visible again, so you can publish your changes.
9.5.3. Unpublishing Your Page
If you need to take a page—or a whole site—off the Web, you can tell Page Creator to stop publishing it. When
you unpublish a page, the page still exists in Page Creator—it's just no longer out there on the Web for all to
see.
As with publishing a page, you have two ways to unpublish:
From Page Editor. The blue bar at the bottom of Page Editor, shown in Figure 9-22, gives the Web
address for that page. When a page is published, an "unpublish" link appears at the end of that address.
Click "unpublish", and then confirm your choice by clicking OK to take the page off the Web.
From Site Manager. When you're in Site Manager, you can unpublish a single page or a whole group of
pages all at once. Turn on the checkboxes of the pages you want to take off the Web. Then, from the More
Actions menu, choose Unpublish, and Page Creator unpublishes the page or pages you chose.
Figure 9-22. At the bottom of Page Editor, click the "unpublish" link (circled) to take your page off
the Web. You can always publish it again later.

 

 
9.6. Creating Multiple Web Sites
Once you've been bitten by the Web design bug, you may want to create more than one site. Page Creator lets
you easily create and manage up to three sites from a single account.
To create a new site, start in Site Manager and follow these steps:
In Site Manager, click the upper-right "Create a new site" link, shown back in Figure 9-3.
Google opens the Create a New Site page (Figure 9-23).
1.
In the text box under "Choose an address", give your site a name. The name you choose appears in the
URL in front of googlepages.com, like this: http://AnotherGreatSite.googlepages.com. Click the "check
availability!" button to see whether the name you want is available.
Page Creator lets you know whether you can use the name, or whether someone else has already taken it.
If the name you want is taken, try another, and then check its availability. When you find a name that's
available, move on to the next step.
2.
Choose a starting layout and look. Google displays its layouts ([click here]) and templates ([click here])
right on the Create a New Site page. Click the ones you want to select them (you can always change them
later), and then click Create Site.
Page Creator creates your new site, and adds it to the list in Site Manager.
3.
Figure 9-23. You can have up to three sites in one Page Creator account. Page Creator lets you know
how many sites you've got left in the "Choose an address" section (circled). This section is also
where you type in a site name to see if it's available. After that, you just choose an initial layout and
template, and then click the Create Site button (not shown).

Once you've created a site, you can create and edit pages for it. Keep track of which site you're working in by
using Site Manager's upper-right drop-down list.
 

 
Part 4: Google Apps for Organizations
Chapter 10
Chapter 11
Chapter 12
Chapter 13
Chapter 10. Putting Google Apps to Work
So far, you've read about individual Google programs, like Docs, Gmail, and Calendar. Wouldn't it be great if
everyone in your company or that charity you volunteer at could do more than simply use these programs in a
haphazard, use-at-your-leisure manner? Sure, it's great that Carla in accounting uses Google Doc's spreadsheet
program, Phil in sales uses the presentation app, and a few folks use Gmail. But consider what happens when
you get everyone in the organization using Google Apps (with a capital A), the whole suite of programs and
services from Google:
Avoid the "Microsoft tax." Most companies spend a whole lotta money on software, and a lot of time
keeping it up to date. Google Apps accounts range from free to not-very-expensive-when-you-think-
about-it, and Google takes care of updates for you.
Customize your apps. You can add your logo to each app, and control how people can use them (like
whether they can share documents outside your organization).
Instant intranet. You can customize your company's Start Page ([click here]), which is like an iGoogle
page for your whole organization. You can add stuff to it like news from your central office, links to
commonly downloaded files, a calendar of company events, and so on (in other words, turn Start Page
into the much vaunted intranets that are beyond the reach of most small firms).
Google Apps comes in a few different flavors, including one that's free (Standard Edition—see [click here]). But
even the version they sell—the so-called Premier Edition—costs only $50 per year per person and gives you full
access to all the apps Google has to offer: email; word processing, spreadsheet, and presentation programs;
chat; a powerful calendar application; and ways to create public Web pages and sites for project teams. And
because you're getting your software as a service from Google, hosted on Google's computers and delivered to
you over the Internet, that saves you the hassle of having to buy, install, license, configure, and support all
those programs separately. You also don't have to worry about backups when Google's got your back. And the
ability to collaborate in real time makes using Apps a no-brainer. All you need is a domain name ([click
here])—that's a name for your company's Web site—and you can sign up for a Google Apps account.

NOTE
This chapter, along with Chapters 11 and 13, is aimed at techie types who want to manage a Google
Apps domain for their organizations. If you just use the individual apps described in Chapter 2–Chapter 9
and Chapter 12, or if your organization has a Google Apps account but you're not involved in managing
it, these chapters aren't aimed at you. They get pretty technical, so unless you want to learn about
domain aliases and APIs, you can skip to Chapter 12 ([click here]) or the appendix ([click here]).
Google employees use Google Apps, all the way up to management. And it's not just great for businesses—it
works just as well for other kinds of groups. Extended families, theater groups, softball leagues, friends of the
library, kennel clubs, the class reunion committee—any group that could benefit from Google's tools for
communication and collaboration can create a Google Apps account. You can create official email accounts for
your group's members, share calendars and invitations, and chat online with other members of the group. All
the good stuff that you get with Google's separate applications are rolled into one centralized, easy-to-
administer package.
This chapter tells you how to open and set up a Google Apps account (it takes less than 5 minutes to sign up).
It also walks you through customizing your domain before you roll Google Apps out across your organization, so
you can get everything just the way you want it. After that, you can add users and migrate your company's
email over to Google Apps, and you'll have a centralized place to manage a world of productivity.
10.1. Signing Up for Google Apps
To get started with your Google Apps account, head to the main Google Apps page, www.google.com/a. To
create your account, click one of the "Learn more" links. This gets you to the sign-up page shown in Figure 10-
1. Click the big blue "Compare Editions and Sign Up" button.
Figure 10-1. On the Google Apps welcome page, read about the goodies Google offers, if you like, or
just click the Compare Editions and Sign Up button (circled) to get started.

The page in Figure 10-2 opens with side-by-side comparisons of the different editions of Google Apps. (The box
on [click here] helps you decide which edition best fits your needs.) When you know which edition you want,
click its Sign Up button.
Figure 10-2. The comparison chart shown here gives you Google's summary of the various Google
Apps editions you can sign up for. Check out the box on [click here] for the Missing Manuals guided
tour through these options. Once you've chosen an edition, click its Sign Up button.

The page shown in Figure 10-3 opens, asking for your domain name. A domain name is your organization's
address on the Web, typically ending with .com, .net, or .edu. For example, google.com is Google's domain
name.
Figure 10-3. If your organization has a domain name, enter it here, and then click Get Started. If you
don't have a domain, you can buy one through Google for $10 a year (not rock-bottom pricing, but
fairly competitive with most mainstream domain name sellers). Click "I want to buy a domain name"
(circled), and read the info on [click here] to select and register a domain name through Google.

What you do next depends on whether your group already has a domain. If it does, read the next section; if not,
skip to [click here] to learn how to buy one through Google. (Having your own domain name lets you give
everyone in your group official-sounding email addresses—marty@petluggage.com,
darlene@babiesrule.com—among other perks.) Or, if you want to register with a domain you don't own, (like
shirley@notredame.edu) then hop to [click here].
NOTE
This chapter describes the sign-up process for the free, highly popular Standard Edition and gives a
general sense of what's involved in signing up and registering your site. The exact sign-in process differs
slightly depending on the edition you choose. For example, you need a credit card number to sign up for
the Premier Edition, and you need a federal Employer or Tax ID number to sign up for the Education
Edition.
Frequently Asked Question: Decisions, Decisions
Which edition of Google Apps is right for me?
The first decision you have to make when creating a Google Apps account is which edition makes
sense for your organization. Here's a guided tour to help you decide.
All three editions offer these basics: an iGoogle-style start page, Gmail, Google Talk, Calendar,

Docs, and Sites. You also get mobile access to all that stuff, an administrator's Control Panel to
manage your account, IMAP capabilities ([click here]) for Gmail, and online Help files and user
discussion groups.
That's how the editions are alike. Here are the differences:
Standard Edition. The big advantage here is cost: This edition is free—free as that lunch
they say doesn't exist. They also say you get what you pay for, and Standard Edition offers
"only" 6.5 GB of storage per Gmail account (that's quite a bit, but videos and other big
attachments munch a lot of megabytes); no phone support; no APIs ([click here]) to help
you integrate Google Apps with your existing infrastructure; and no policy management
([click here]), routing controls ([click here]), or migration tools for email ([click here]). Also,
email messages show targeted ads ([click here]); you can't turn them off. Still, it's free.
Standard Edition can be an excellent choice for small businesses, far-flung families, clubs,
and other groups that want to offer Google Apps' tools for keeping in touch and working (or
playing) together.
Premier Edition. You should know up front that Premier Edition will cost you: The current
price is $50 per user per year. (When you do the math, that works out to four dollars and
change monthly for each user. Compare that to your organization's licensing fees for all the
software it uses now.) When you pay that price, though, you get all the advantages of the
free Standard Edition and a whole lot more: free phone support (during business hours), 25
GB of storage for each Gmail account (and the ability to turn off ads), conference room and
resource scheduling for meetings, the ability to manage email policies and recover messages
via Postini ([click here]), and tools to help you integrate Google Apps with your company's
existing IT infrastructure and migrate your current email system to Gmail. With Premier
Edition, the first 30 days are free, so you can try it out and see whether your organization
needs the increased support and flexibility. When you purchase a Premier Edition account,
you pay for a full year's use for the number of users you specify. (The first year begins after
the 30-day free trial.) You can add more user accounts, but you can't get a refund for a
partial year's use or for deleting user accounts.
Education Edition. Although this is called Education Edition, it's also available to nonprofits.
(Nonprofits must prove federal 501(c)(3) status by giving Google their federal tax ID
numbers.) For schools and colleges with a .edu domain, or any verifiable nonprofit
organization, Education Edition combines the best of the Standard and Premier editions. In
fact, the only differences between the Premier and Education editions are the price
(Education Edition is free) and a few things about email: Education offers 6.5 GB of email
storage (compared to 25 GB for Premier) and there's no Postini-based policy management
and message recovery ([click here]).
To sign up your group or organization for any of these editions, you need to own or control
your organization's domain ([click here]). If you're part of a domain but you don't control
it—in other words, if you have an email address like me@mycompany.com but you're not
one of the anointed few who actually manage the mycompany.com domain—you can still
sign up for the Google Apps Team Edition and collaborate with other Google Apps users in
the mycompany.com domain. The box on [click here] tells you about Google Apps Team
Edition and how it differs from the editions listed here.
10.1.1. Route 1: You Already Own or Control a Domain
If your organization already owns a domain, Google asks whether you control the domain or simply use it:

If you control the domain. If you're a domain administrator with the power to upload HTML files or
make changes to the domain, turn on the Administrator radio button (shown back in Figure 10-3), and
then, in the "Enter your domain name" box, fill in your domain name: myvastdomain.com or
ourfamilydomain.net or localnonprofit.org—whatever domain you're registering.
If you don't control the domain. Maybe you know that other people in your school or organization
already use Google Apps—and you want to, too—but you don't have any authority to control or manage
the domain. For example, if your email address is something like student@mycollege.edu, you use the
mycollege.edu domain to get email, but you're not the IT Administrator who manages the domain for the
college. (Same goes if you have a work email address like me@mycompany.com.) If this sounds like you,
you can sign up for the Google Apps Team Edition—skip to [click here] to find out how.
Click Get Started. Google opens the sign-up form shown in Figure 10-4. For organizations or groups that have
their own domain name, Google asks for the following info:
Number of users. Put in your best ballpark guess here. You can always add users ([click here]) later.
Account Administrator. This section asks about the person who'll manage your new Google Apps
account. The person's name, email address, phone number, and country are all required. Optionally, you
can supply the administrator's job title. You also have to turn on the checkbox that says you understand
that if you're unable to change DNS records for this domain, Google Apps may not work properly.
Figure 10-4. Here's the registration form you see if you're an administrator of an existing domain,
and you're signing up for the Google Apps Standard Edition.

NOTE
DNS, which stands for "domain name system," is what translates domain names, like google.com or
mynewdomain.com, into IP addresses. An IP address is a group of numbers, like 123.45.67.89, that
indicates a computer's address on the Internet. (IP stands for "Internet protocol.") You need to be able
to change your domain's DNS records to activate email in your Google Apps account (see [click here]). If
you own a domain, you can change its DNS records.
Organization Information. This section is optional. You can give your organization's name and type,
size, and tell Google about its current email accounts (if any).

When you've filled out all the required information, click Continue. Google opens the third and final sign-up
page, shown in Figure 10-5. Here's what's on it:
Figure 10-5. Google needs some basic info to set up the account for your organization's Google Apps
administrator.
Your administrator account. Set up your Google Apps administrator account by choosing a user name
and password. Google asks whether you want to receive Google Apps tips and news at this administrator
account, and whether you're willing to provide feedback about your Google Apps experience. Turn on the
checkboxes as you prefer.
Terms and Conditions. Read through the Terms and Conditions presented here, and then click "I accept.

Continue with set up."
Google creates your Google Apps account, and opens your account Dashboard, shown in Figure 10-6. But you've
got one more step before you're cleared for take-off: verifying your domain, so Google knows it's really yours.
Figure 10-6. You can't activate the services in your Google Apps account until Google verifies your
domain. To verify, click the "Verify domain ownership" link (circled).
10.1.1.1. Verify your domain
When you open a Google Apps account for a domain that's registered outside of Google, you need to verify it.
Until you do, your Google Apps Dashboard displays a reminder to do so (you can see it in Figure 10-6). To verify
and get going, click the "Verify domain ownership" link at the top of the page. Google opens the page shown in
Figure 10-7.
Figure 10-7. Here's where you let Google know you have control over your domain. You've got two
different ways to verify your domain: create an HTML file with the name and content Google
specifies and upload it to your domain, or change a CNAME record for a subdomain (details in the
box on [click here]). Choose a method from the drop-down list, and then click Verify to get
instructions from Google.

Choose how you want to verify your domain:
Upload an HTML file. When you choose this option, Google gives you a name for an HTML file. Upload a
file with that name to your site so Google knows the site's legit.
Change your CNAME record. A CNAME record (see the box on [click here]) lives in your Domain
Management Settings, and lets you control a subdomain of your domain (for example,
blogs.catpower.com is a subdomain of catpower.com). If you choose this method, Google specifies a
CNAME record for you to use with your domain, and then checks the domain to see if it has that CNAME
record.
Click Verify. Whichever method you choose, Google specifies what you should upload or change. When you've
uploaded the HTML file or changed a CNAME record, click Verify again.
Google verifies your Web site by checking the change you made. This process may take as little as a few
minutes or as long as 48 hours. Be patient! Once you're verified, the verification notice disappears from the top
of the administrator's Dashboard. Even better, Google starts activating your apps: Start Page ([click here]),
Chat, Docs, Calendar, and Sites. (You have to activate email yourself—see [click here].)
Now that you've created a Google Apps account for your domain, you can sign into that account and start
managing it. Jump to [click here] to learn how.

Up to Speed: What's in a CNAME?
As explained in the Note on [click here], DNS translates domain names into numbers that
computers can understand. Sometimes, you might have several domain names which you want to
point at the same IP address because they're all hosted on the same server (like if you have your
main Web site at www.yourdomain.com, a blog at http://blog.yourdomain.com, and also host your
friend's Web site at www.theirdomain.com, but keep them all on the same server). But what if that
IP address needs to change? With standard DNS "A" records (which translate domain names into
IP addresses), you'd have to go into each individual domain and update its DNS entries to point to
the new IP address, which can be time consuming. Luckily, CNAMEs can save you some hassle.
CNAME is short for "canonical name", and is the name applied to DNS records that point from one
domain name (like www.yourdomain.com) or subdomains (like http://start.yourdomain.com) to
another domain name. So if, for example, you add a CNAME entry that points from
http://start.yourdomain.com to www.ghs.google.com, your browser will look for the DNS entry for
http://start.yourdomain.com, and get the IP address for www.ghs.google.com and go there,
instead. That way, you don't have to go into http://start.yourdomain.com and change its DNS
entry—the CNAME entry does the work for you.
Google Apps lets you change the URLs for your apps ([click here]) using CNAMEs. So if you don't
like the clunky Web address Google assigns your Start Page, you can change it to something like
start.yourdomain.com. (Google wants you to use CNAMEs so they can change the IP address for
the servers hosting your services without you needing to lift a finger.)
You can use CNAMEs in two ways within Google Apps:
To verify your domain during sign-up, by creating a subdomain or renaming an existing one
with a Google-specified CNAME ([click here]).
To customize the Web addresses of the apps in your account ([click here]).
10.1.2. Route 2: You Want to Buy a Domain from Google
Say you're ready to take advantage of all Google Apps has to offer, but your organization doesn't have a
domain name. No problem: Buy a domain name through Google for $10 per year. To go this route, you do have
to choose the Standard Edition to begin your sign-up process. (You can always upgrade to Premier later—[click
here] tells you how.)
To go straight to the Standard Edition sign-up page (shown in Figure 10-3), head to this URL:
www.google.com/a/cpanel/domain/new. Once you're there, here's now to register your domain name with
Google:
Click "I want to buy a domain name".
The page changes to look like Figure 10-8. This page is where you choose your domain name.
1.

In the box, type the domain name you want. From the drop-down list to its left, choose a top-level
domain—the part of your domain name that comes after the dot, like com or net or edu. Then click "Check
availability."
A page opens to let you know whether that domain name is available. If it's taken, Google suggests
similar, available alternatives. You can choose one of these by turning on its radio button, or you can think
up a different name and check its availability. If the name is available, then Google lets you know, and
reminds you that it costs $10 a year to register the name through Google.
0.
When you've found an available domain name you like, click "Continue to registration".
Google opens the sign-up page shown in Figure 10-9. To register your domain, Google needs the following
info:
Figure 10-8. The first step in buying a domain through Google is to find an available
domain name that you like. (If the name you want is taken, Google suggests
alternatives.)
Figure 10-9. Here's the form you fill out to register your domain.
1.

Privacy options. Like a massive Internet phone book, the WHOIS directory registers information
about domain names, including stuff about a domain's owner. This info is public, so anyone who
looks up your domain can find your contact information, including your phone number and address.
But becoming part of the WHOIS directory is optional, so if you'd rather not make that info publicly
available, leave the "Keep my registration information unlisted" checkbox turned on.
Name. Provide your first and last names.
Email address. Make sure this is a current email address—one that already works, not one you plan
to use for the new domain.
Type. How would you classify the domain you're creating: business, personal, or other?
Job title/Organization name. You have to fill in these fields if you're creating a business domain.
They're optional if you selected Other as the domain type, and you don't have to fill them in for a
personal domain.
Country. Choose a country from this drop-down list.

Address. The usual info: street, city, state or province, and Zip or postal code.
Phone number. Include your area code, and separate sections with hyphens, like this: 111-222-
3333.
Fax number. This info's optional.
I have read the GoDaddy.com Universal Terms of Service. Google registers domain names
through GoDaddy.com, one of the Internet's biggest domain registrars. Click the link to read the
terms. If you agree, turn on this checkbox.
Automatically renew my registration every year. When you own a domain name, you have to
renew its registration annually. Since you probably plan on having your domain hang around for a
while (or else you wouldn't be going to all this trouble to set it up), leave this checkbox turned on for
the convenience of automatic renewal.
When you've filled out the form, click "I accept. Proceed to Google Checkout."
A Google Checkout page opens, with your order for the domain name filled in. (Google Checkout is
Google's online shopping cart service.)
Provide your credit card info, check the total, and then click "Place your order now".
Google takes a moment to run your credit card. When it's done, it shows a confirmation page like the one
in Figure 10-10.
Figure 10-10. After you've paid the $10 registration fee, Google confirms your purchase.
Click either of the circled links to finish setting up Google Apps for your new domain.
2.

Click "Return to Google Apps" or "Click here to retrieve your purchase", and Google returns you to the
domain registration process.
Congratulations! You're now the proud owner of a brand-new domain. When Google takes you back to the
registration process, it takes you to the setup stage (shown in Figure 10-5), where you choose a user name and
password for your new domain. Provide those, click "Continue with setup" and Google whisks you right to your
Google Apps Dashboard. You can get started customizing your Apps account right away: add users ([click
here]), upload a logo ([click here]), or customize the domain's Start Page ([click here]).
NOTE
It might take Google a while to process the $10 payment for your domain. Until the payment clears,
Google doesn't activate any of the services in your domain (like Google Talk, Calendar, and so on). To
check on how your payment's coming along, sign into your Google Account, and then go to
http://checkout.google.com.
10.1.3. Route 3: You Want to Register Using a Domain You Don't Own
If you use a domain but don't own it—for example, if you're a student using your school's domain for email, like
joecollege@pennstate.edu—you're not locked out of the benefits of using Google Apps. You can sign up for the

Team Edition, which lets you set up your Google Apps the way you like them, and easily share with others in the
same domain (the box on [click here] gives you the lowdown on Team Edition).
To get started with the Team Edition, sign up using the same page you'd use for Standard Edition. (You can
point your browser straight to this address: www.google.com/a/cpanel/domain/new.) On the sign-up page
shown in Figure 10-3, turn on the "End-user" radio button. The page changes to ask for your email address;
type it in. (The email address must be the one you use through a business, organization, or school you're
affiliated with: me@aol.com doesn't work, for example, but me@localnonprofit.org does.) Then click Get
Started.
The sign-up page that opens, shown in Figure 10-11, collects this information:
Account Information. In this section, create a password for your Google Apps account, and then retype
the wavy green letters to prove you're a human being, not some kind of Web bot ([click here]).
Figure 10-11. The Google Apps Team Edition lets students and employees create a personal
Google Apps account for their school or work domain, even though they don't own those
domains.

NOTE
To keep your Google Apps account secure, make up a new password just for this account—don't
recycle the password you already use to sign in at work. For tips on creating a good password, see
the box on [click here].
Contact Information. Fill in your name and location.
Terms and Conditions. Read through the Terms of Service for creating a Google Apps account. (Click
Printable Version to open the terms in a new window that's a bit easier on the eyes.)
When you've filled out the form and are ready to move forward, click "I accept. Continue to Google Apps."
10.1.3.1. Verify your email address
When you submit the form shown in Figure 10-11, Google sends a verification email to the address you
supplied. To complete your sign-up for Google Apps Team Edition, zip over to your Inbox to find that verification
email. Open it, and then click the activation link it contains. This opens a new page, confirming that Google has
verified your address. Click "Click here to continue", sign in using the email address you supplied, and Google
takes you to your Team Edition Dashboard, shown in Figure 10-12.
Figure 10-12. Google Apps Team Edition's Dashboard is slightly different from other editions. From
here, you can customize your account's appearance, invite people to open their own Team Edition
accounts, and get started with the apps on the right side of the page: Google Sites, Docs, Calendar,
Start Page, and Chat.

Frequently Asked Question: One for the Team
What's Google Apps Team Edition, and how is it different from the Standard Edition?
If you're not the owner or administrator of the domain you're registering, Google signs you up for
Team Edition. This makes sense: Since you don't control your organization's domain, you can't just
go barging in and become the administrator of a Google Apps account for that domain. (The real
domain administrator might get kinda ticked off.)
Signing up for Team Edition gets you Google Docs, Talk, Calendar, Sites, and an iGoogle-style
personalized Start Page, and with Team Edition, you can take advantage of the centralized
collaboration and communication that Google Apps offers. Signing up for Team Edition links your
account with all the other Google Apps accounts within your organization. For example, if your
email address is joecollege@stateuniversity.edu, Team Edition automatically hooks you up with
everyone else who has an @stateuniversity.edu email address and a Google Apps account:
Easy access to all other Google Apps users in your organization through your Contacts list.
One-click sharing of documents with those contacts.
Easy sharing of your Google Calendar with everyone in your organization.

The ability to create team sites (Chapter 12) to share videos, documents, and other info with
a select group or your whole organization.
If you already have a Google Account (Chapter 1) and you use the same non-Gmail email address
to sign into the Google Account and Team Edition, then signing up for Team Edition affects your
existing Google Docs and Google Calendar accounts. You'll probably want to move your documents
into your new account—which you can do by exporting the data from your other account's apps
(see the chapter that covers the specific app to learn how). And any new document and calendar
invitations you receive go to your Google Apps account, not to your Google Account's Docs and
Calendar.
Finally, you should know that first dibs on managing your Google Apps account always belong to
whoever owns or controls your organization's domain. So if the person who uses
ITAdmin@stateuniversity.com sets up a Google Apps account for the stateuniversity.com domain,
you'll see some changes. For example, only the admin (or people the admin gives administrative
privileges to) can make across-the-board changes like customizing how Google Apps looks,
inviting new users, changing default settings, or editing your organization's info. If your IT admin
takes over your organization's Google Apps account, your Team Edition account changes to
whatever edition that person choose for the domain (Google lets you know with a notification in
your Dashboard).
 

 
Part 4: Google Apps for Organizations
Chapter 10
Chapter 11
Chapter 12
Chapter 13
Chapter 10. Putting Google Apps to Work
So far, you've read about individual Google programs, like Docs, Gmail, and Calendar. Wouldn't it be great if
everyone in your company or that charity you volunteer at could do more than simply use these programs in a
haphazard, use-at-your-leisure manner? Sure, it's great that Carla in accounting uses Google Doc's spreadsheet
program, Phil in sales uses the presentation app, and a few folks use Gmail. But consider what happens when
you get everyone in the organization using Google Apps (with a capital A), the whole suite of programs and
services from Google:
Avoid the "Microsoft tax." Most companies spend a whole lotta money on software, and a lot of time
keeping it up to date. Google Apps accounts range from free to not-very-expensive-when-you-think-
about-it, and Google takes care of updates for you.
Customize your apps. You can add your logo to each app, and control how people can use them (like
whether they can share documents outside your organization).
Instant intranet. You can customize your company's Start Page ([click here]), which is like an iGoogle
page for your whole organization. You can add stuff to it like news from your central office, links to
commonly downloaded files, a calendar of company events, and so on (in other words, turn Start Page
into the much vaunted intranets that are beyond the reach of most small firms).
Google Apps comes in a few different flavors, including one that's free (Standard Edition—see [click here]). But
even the version they sell—the so-called Premier Edition—costs only $50 per year per person and gives you full
access to all the apps Google has to offer: email; word processing, spreadsheet, and presentation programs;
chat; a powerful calendar application; and ways to create public Web pages and sites for project teams. And
because you're getting your software as a service from Google, hosted on Google's computers and delivered to
you over the Internet, that saves you the hassle of having to buy, install, license, configure, and support all
those programs separately. You also don't have to worry about backups when Google's got your back. And the
ability to collaborate in real time makes using Apps a no-brainer. All you need is a domain name ([click
here])—that's a name for your company's Web site—and you can sign up for a Google Apps account.

NOTE
This chapter, along with Chapters 11 and 13, is aimed at techie types who want to manage a Google
Apps domain for their organizations. If you just use the individual apps described in Chapter 2–Chapter 9
and Chapter 12, or if your organization has a Google Apps account but you're not involved in managing
it, these chapters aren't aimed at you. They get pretty technical, so unless you want to learn about
domain aliases and APIs, you can skip to Chapter 12 ([click here]) or the appendix ([click here]).
Google employees use Google Apps, all the way up to management. And it's not just great for businesses—it
works just as well for other kinds of groups. Extended families, theater groups, softball leagues, friends of the
library, kennel clubs, the class reunion committee—any group that could benefit from Google's tools for
communication and collaboration can create a Google Apps account. You can create official email accounts for
your group's members, share calendars and invitations, and chat online with other members of the group. All
the good stuff that you get with Google's separate applications are rolled into one centralized, easy-to-
administer package.
This chapter tells you how to open and set up a Google Apps account (it takes less than 5 minutes to sign up).
It also walks you through customizing your domain before you roll Google Apps out across your organization, so
you can get everything just the way you want it. After that, you can add users and migrate your company's
email over to Google Apps, and you'll have a centralized place to manage a world of productivity.
10.1. Signing Up for Google Apps
To get started with your Google Apps account, head to the main Google Apps page, www.google.com/a. To
create your account, click one of the "Learn more" links. This gets you to the sign-up page shown in Figure 10-
1. Click the big blue "Compare Editions and Sign Up" button.
Figure 10-1. On the Google Apps welcome page, read about the goodies Google offers, if you like, or
just click the Compare Editions and Sign Up button (circled) to get started.

The page in Figure 10-2 opens with side-by-side comparisons of the different editions of Google Apps. (The box
on [click here] helps you decide which edition best fits your needs.) When you know which edition you want,
click its Sign Up button.
Figure 10-2. The comparison chart shown here gives you Google's summary of the various Google
Apps editions you can sign up for. Check out the box on [click here] for the Missing Manuals guided
tour through these options. Once you've chosen an edition, click its Sign Up button.

The page shown in Figure 10-3 opens, asking for your domain name. A domain name is your organization's
address on the Web, typically ending with .com, .net, or .edu. For example, google.com is Google's domain
name.
Figure 10-3. If your organization has a domain name, enter it here, and then click Get Started. If you
don't have a domain, you can buy one through Google for $10 a year (not rock-bottom pricing, but
fairly competitive with most mainstream domain name sellers). Click "I want to buy a domain name"
(circled), and read the info on [click here] to select and register a domain name through Google.

What you do next depends on whether your group already has a domain. If it does, read the next section; if not,
skip to [click here] to learn how to buy one through Google. (Having your own domain name lets you give
everyone in your group official-sounding email addresses—marty@petluggage.com,
darlene@babiesrule.com—among other perks.) Or, if you want to register with a domain you don't own, (like
shirley@notredame.edu) then hop to [click here].
NOTE
This chapter describes the sign-up process for the free, highly popular Standard Edition and gives a
general sense of what's involved in signing up and registering your site. The exact sign-in process differs
slightly depending on the edition you choose. For example, you need a credit card number to sign up for
the Premier Edition, and you need a federal Employer or Tax ID number to sign up for the Education
Edition.
Frequently Asked Question: Decisions, Decisions
Which edition of Google Apps is right for me?
The first decision you have to make when creating a Google Apps account is which edition makes
sense for your organization. Here's a guided tour to help you decide.
All three editions offer these basics: an iGoogle-style start page, Gmail, Google Talk, Calendar,

Docs, and Sites. You also get mobile access to all that stuff, an administrator's Control Panel to
manage your account, IMAP capabilities ([click here]) for Gmail, and online Help files and user
discussion groups.
That's how the editions are alike. Here are the differences:
Standard Edition. The big advantage here is cost: This edition is free—free as that lunch
they say doesn't exist. They also say you get what you pay for, and Standard Edition offers
"only" 6.5 GB of storage per Gmail account (that's quite a bit, but videos and other big
attachments munch a lot of megabytes); no phone support; no APIs ([click here]) to help
you integrate Google Apps with your existing infrastructure; and no policy management
([click here]), routing controls ([click here]), or migration tools for email ([click here]). Also,
email messages show targeted ads ([click here]); you can't turn them off. Still, it's free.
Standard Edition can be an excellent choice for small businesses, far-flung families, clubs,
and other groups that want to offer Google Apps' tools for keeping in touch and working (or
playing) together.
Premier Edition. You should know up front that Premier Edition will cost you: The current
price is $50 per user per year. (When you do the math, that works out to four dollars and
change monthly for each user. Compare that to your organization's licensing fees for all the
software it uses now.) When you pay that price, though, you get all the advantages of the
free Standard Edition and a whole lot more: free phone support (during business hours), 25
GB of storage for each Gmail account (and the ability to turn off ads), conference room and
resource scheduling for meetings, the ability to manage email policies and recover messages
via Postini ([click here]), and tools to help you integrate Google Apps with your company's
existing IT infrastructure and migrate your current email system to Gmail. With Premier
Edition, the first 30 days are free, so you can try it out and see whether your organization
needs the increased support and flexibility. When you purchase a Premier Edition account,
you pay for a full year's use for the number of users you specify. (The first year begins after
the 30-day free trial.) You can add more user accounts, but you can't get a refund for a
partial year's use or for deleting user accounts.
Education Edition. Although this is called Education Edition, it's also available to nonprofits.
(Nonprofits must prove federal 501(c)(3) status by giving Google their federal tax ID
numbers.) For schools and colleges with a .edu domain, or any verifiable nonprofit
organization, Education Edition combines the best of the Standard and Premier editions. In
fact, the only differences between the Premier and Education editions are the price
(Education Edition is free) and a few things about email: Education offers 6.5 GB of email
storage (compared to 25 GB for Premier) and there's no Postini-based policy management
and message recovery ([click here]).
To sign up your group or organization for any of these editions, you need to own or control
your organization's domain ([click here]). If you're part of a domain but you don't control
it—in other words, if you have an email address like me@mycompany.com but you're not
one of the anointed few who actually manage the mycompany.com domain—you can still
sign up for the Google Apps Team Edition and collaborate with other Google Apps users in
the mycompany.com domain. The box on [click here] tells you about Google Apps Team
Edition and how it differs from the editions listed here.
10.1.1. Route 1: You Already Own or Control a Domain
If your organization already owns a domain, Google asks whether you control the domain or simply use it:

If you control the domain. If you're a domain administrator with the power to upload HTML files or
make changes to the domain, turn on the Administrator radio button (shown back in Figure 10-3), and
then, in the "Enter your domain name" box, fill in your domain name: myvastdomain.com or
ourfamilydomain.net or localnonprofit.org—whatever domain you're registering.
If you don't control the domain. Maybe you know that other people in your school or organization
already use Google Apps—and you want to, too—but you don't have any authority to control or manage
the domain. For example, if your email address is something like student@mycollege.edu, you use the
mycollege.edu domain to get email, but you're not the IT Administrator who manages the domain for the
college. (Same goes if you have a work email address like me@mycompany.com.) If this sounds like you,
you can sign up for the Google Apps Team Edition—skip to [click here] to find out how.
Click Get Started. Google opens the sign-up form shown in Figure 10-4. For organizations or groups that have
their own domain name, Google asks for the following info:
Number of users. Put in your best ballpark guess here. You can always add users ([click here]) later.
Account Administrator. This section asks about the person who'll manage your new Google Apps
account. The person's name, email address, phone number, and country are all required. Optionally, you
can supply the administrator's job title. You also have to turn on the checkbox that says you understand
that if you're unable to change DNS records for this domain, Google Apps may not work properly.
Figure 10-4. Here's the registration form you see if you're an administrator of an existing domain,
and you're signing up for the Google Apps Standard Edition.

NOTE
DNS, which stands for "domain name system," is what translates domain names, like google.com or
mynewdomain.com, into IP addresses. An IP address is a group of numbers, like 123.45.67.89, that
indicates a computer's address on the Internet. (IP stands for "Internet protocol.") You need to be able
to change your domain's DNS records to activate email in your Google Apps account (see [click here]). If
you own a domain, you can change its DNS records.
Organization Information. This section is optional. You can give your organization's name and type,
size, and tell Google about its current email accounts (if any).

When you've filled out all the required information, click Continue. Google opens the third and final sign-up
page, shown in Figure 10-5. Here's what's on it:
Figure 10-5. Google needs some basic info to set up the account for your organization's Google Apps
administrator.
Your administrator account. Set up your Google Apps administrator account by choosing a user name
and password. Google asks whether you want to receive Google Apps tips and news at this administrator
account, and whether you're willing to provide feedback about your Google Apps experience. Turn on the
checkboxes as you prefer.
Terms and Conditions. Read through the Terms and Conditions presented here, and then click "I accept.

Continue with set up."
Google creates your Google Apps account, and opens your account Dashboard, shown in Figure 10-6. But you've
got one more step before you're cleared for take-off: verifying your domain, so Google knows it's really yours.
Figure 10-6. You can't activate the services in your Google Apps account until Google verifies your
domain. To verify, click the "Verify domain ownership" link (circled).
10.1.1.1. Verify your domain
When you open a Google Apps account for a domain that's registered outside of Google, you need to verify it.
Until you do, your Google Apps Dashboard displays a reminder to do so (you can see it in Figure 10-6). To verify
and get going, click the "Verify domain ownership" link at the top of the page. Google opens the page shown in
Figure 10-7.
Figure 10-7. Here's where you let Google know you have control over your domain. You've got two
different ways to verify your domain: create an HTML file with the name and content Google
specifies and upload it to your domain, or change a CNAME record for a subdomain (details in the
box on [click here]). Choose a method from the drop-down list, and then click Verify to get
instructions from Google.

Choose how you want to verify your domain:
Upload an HTML file. When you choose this option, Google gives you a name for an HTML file. Upload a
file with that name to your site so Google knows the site's legit.
Change your CNAME record. A CNAME record (see the box on [click here]) lives in your Domain
Management Settings, and lets you control a subdomain of your domain (for example,
blogs.catpower.com is a subdomain of catpower.com). If you choose this method, Google specifies a
CNAME record for you to use with your domain, and then checks the domain to see if it has that CNAME
record.
Click Verify. Whichever method you choose, Google specifies what you should upload or change. When you've
uploaded the HTML file or changed a CNAME record, click Verify again.
Google verifies your Web site by checking the change you made. This process may take as little as a few
minutes or as long as 48 hours. Be patient! Once you're verified, the verification notice disappears from the top
of the administrator's Dashboard. Even better, Google starts activating your apps: Start Page ([click here]),
Chat, Docs, Calendar, and Sites. (You have to activate email yourself—see [click here].)
Now that you've created a Google Apps account for your domain, you can sign into that account and start
managing it. Jump to [click here] to learn how.

Up to Speed: What's in a CNAME?
As explained in the Note on [click here], DNS translates domain names into numbers that
computers can understand. Sometimes, you might have several domain names which you want to
point at the same IP address because they're all hosted on the same server (like if you have your
main Web site at www.yourdomain.com, a blog at http://blog.yourdomain.com, and also host your
friend's Web site at www.theirdomain.com, but keep them all on the same server). But what if that
IP address needs to change? With standard DNS "A" records (which translate domain names into
IP addresses), you'd have to go into each individual domain and update its DNS entries to point to
the new IP address, which can be time consuming. Luckily, CNAMEs can save you some hassle.
CNAME is short for "canonical name", and is the name applied to DNS records that point from one
domain name (like www.yourdomain.com) or subdomains (like http://start.yourdomain.com) to
another domain name. So if, for example, you add a CNAME entry that points from
http://start.yourdomain.com to www.ghs.google.com, your browser will look for the DNS entry for
http://start.yourdomain.com, and get the IP address for www.ghs.google.com and go there,
instead. That way, you don't have to go into http://start.yourdomain.com and change its DNS
entry—the CNAME entry does the work for you.
Google Apps lets you change the URLs for your apps ([click here]) using CNAMEs. So if you don't
like the clunky Web address Google assigns your Start Page, you can change it to something like
start.yourdomain.com. (Google wants you to use CNAMEs so they can change the IP address for
the servers hosting your services without you needing to lift a finger.)
You can use CNAMEs in two ways within Google Apps:
To verify your domain during sign-up, by creating a subdomain or renaming an existing one
with a Google-specified CNAME ([click here]).
To customize the Web addresses of the apps in your account ([click here]).
10.1.2. Route 2: You Want to Buy a Domain from Google
Say you're ready to take advantage of all Google Apps has to offer, but your organization doesn't have a
domain name. No problem: Buy a domain name through Google for $10 per year. To go this route, you do have
to choose the Standard Edition to begin your sign-up process. (You can always upgrade to Premier later—[click
here] tells you how.)
To go straight to the Standard Edition sign-up page (shown in Figure 10-3), head to this URL:
www.google.com/a/cpanel/domain/new. Once you're there, here's now to register your domain name with
Google:
Click "I want to buy a domain name".
The page changes to look like Figure 10-8. This page is where you choose your domain name.
1.

In the box, type the domain name you want. From the drop-down list to its left, choose a top-level
domain—the part of your domain name that comes after the dot, like com or net or edu. Then click "Check
availability."
A page opens to let you know whether that domain name is available. If it's taken, Google suggests
similar, available alternatives. You can choose one of these by turning on its radio button, or you can think
up a different name and check its availability. If the name is available, then Google lets you know, and
reminds you that it costs $10 a year to register the name through Google.
0.
When you've found an available domain name you like, click "Continue to registration".
Google opens the sign-up page shown in Figure 10-9. To register your domain, Google needs the following
info:
Figure 10-8. The first step in buying a domain through Google is to find an available
domain name that you like. (If the name you want is taken, Google suggests
alternatives.)
Figure 10-9. Here's the form you fill out to register your domain.
1.

Privacy options. Like a massive Internet phone book, the WHOIS directory registers information
about domain names, including stuff about a domain's owner. This info is public, so anyone who
looks up your domain can find your contact information, including your phone number and address.
But becoming part of the WHOIS directory is optional, so if you'd rather not make that info publicly
available, leave the "Keep my registration information unlisted" checkbox turned on.
Name. Provide your first and last names.
Email address. Make sure this is a current email address—one that already works, not one you plan
to use for the new domain.
Type. How would you classify the domain you're creating: business, personal, or other?
Job title/Organization name. You have to fill in these fields if you're creating a business domain.
They're optional if you selected Other as the domain type, and you don't have to fill them in for a
personal domain.
Country. Choose a country from this drop-down list.

Address. The usual info: street, city, state or province, and Zip or postal code.
Phone number. Include your area code, and separate sections with hyphens, like this: 111-222-
3333.
Fax number. This info's optional.
I have read the GoDaddy.com Universal Terms of Service. Google registers domain names
through GoDaddy.com, one of the Internet's biggest domain registrars. Click the link to read the
terms. If you agree, turn on this checkbox.
Automatically renew my registration every year. When you own a domain name, you have to
renew its registration annually. Since you probably plan on having your domain hang around for a
while (or else you wouldn't be going to all this trouble to set it up), leave this checkbox turned on for
the convenience of automatic renewal.
When you've filled out the form, click "I accept. Proceed to Google Checkout."
A Google Checkout page opens, with your order for the domain name filled in. (Google Checkout is
Google's online shopping cart service.)
Provide your credit card info, check the total, and then click "Place your order now".
Google takes a moment to run your credit card. When it's done, it shows a confirmation page like the one
in Figure 10-10.
Figure 10-10. After you've paid the $10 registration fee, Google confirms your purchase.
Click either of the circled links to finish setting up Google Apps for your new domain.
2.

Click "Return to Google Apps" or "Click here to retrieve your purchase", and Google returns you to the
domain registration process.
Congratulations! You're now the proud owner of a brand-new domain. When Google takes you back to the
registration process, it takes you to the setup stage (shown in Figure 10-5), where you choose a user name and
password for your new domain. Provide those, click "Continue with setup" and Google whisks you right to your
Google Apps Dashboard. You can get started customizing your Apps account right away: add users ([click
here]), upload a logo ([click here]), or customize the domain's Start Page ([click here]).
NOTE
It might take Google a while to process the $10 payment for your domain. Until the payment clears,
Google doesn't activate any of the services in your domain (like Google Talk, Calendar, and so on). To
check on how your payment's coming along, sign into your Google Account, and then go to
http://checkout.google.com.
10.1.3. Route 3: You Want to Register Using a Domain You Don't Own
If you use a domain but don't own it—for example, if you're a student using your school's domain for email, like
joecollege@pennstate.edu—you're not locked out of the benefits of using Google Apps. You can sign up for the

Team Edition, which lets you set up your Google Apps the way you like them, and easily share with others in the
same domain (the box on [click here] gives you the lowdown on Team Edition).
To get started with the Team Edition, sign up using the same page you'd use for Standard Edition. (You can
point your browser straight to this address: www.google.com/a/cpanel/domain/new.) On the sign-up page
shown in Figure 10-3, turn on the "End-user" radio button. The page changes to ask for your email address;
type it in. (The email address must be the one you use through a business, organization, or school you're
affiliated with: me@aol.com doesn't work, for example, but me@localnonprofit.org does.) Then click Get
Started.
The sign-up page that opens, shown in Figure 10-11, collects this information:
Account Information. In this section, create a password for your Google Apps account, and then retype
the wavy green letters to prove you're a human being, not some kind of Web bot ([click here]).
Figure 10-11. The Google Apps Team Edition lets students and employees create a personal
Google Apps account for their school or work domain, even though they don't own those
domains.

NOTE
To keep your Google Apps account secure, make up a new password just for this account—don't
recycle the password you already use to sign in at work. For tips on creating a good password, see
the box on [click here].
Contact Information. Fill in your name and location.
Terms and Conditions. Read through the Terms of Service for creating a Google Apps account. (Click
Printable Version to open the terms in a new window that's a bit easier on the eyes.)
When you've filled out the form and are ready to move forward, click "I accept. Continue to Google Apps."
10.1.3.1. Verify your email address
When you submit the form shown in Figure 10-11, Google sends a verification email to the address you
supplied. To complete your sign-up for Google Apps Team Edition, zip over to your Inbox to find that verification
email. Open it, and then click the activation link it contains. This opens a new page, confirming that Google has
verified your address. Click "Click here to continue", sign in using the email address you supplied, and Google
takes you to your Team Edition Dashboard, shown in Figure 10-12.
Figure 10-12. Google Apps Team Edition's Dashboard is slightly different from other editions. From
here, you can customize your account's appearance, invite people to open their own Team Edition
accounts, and get started with the apps on the right side of the page: Google Sites, Docs, Calendar,
Start Page, and Chat.

Frequently Asked Question: One for the Team
What's Google Apps Team Edition, and how is it different from the Standard Edition?
If you're not the owner or administrator of the domain you're registering, Google signs you up for
Team Edition. This makes sense: Since you don't control your organization's domain, you can't just
go barging in and become the administrator of a Google Apps account for that domain. (The real
domain administrator might get kinda ticked off.)
Signing up for Team Edition gets you Google Docs, Talk, Calendar, Sites, and an iGoogle-style
personalized Start Page, and with Team Edition, you can take advantage of the centralized
collaboration and communication that Google Apps offers. Signing up for Team Edition links your
account with all the other Google Apps accounts within your organization. For example, if your
email address is joecollege@stateuniversity.edu, Team Edition automatically hooks you up with
everyone else who has an @stateuniversity.edu email address and a Google Apps account:
Easy access to all other Google Apps users in your organization through your Contacts list.
One-click sharing of documents with those contacts.
Easy sharing of your Google Calendar with everyone in your organization.

The ability to create team sites (Chapter 12) to share videos, documents, and other info with
a select group or your whole organization.
If you already have a Google Account (Chapter 1) and you use the same non-Gmail email address
to sign into the Google Account and Team Edition, then signing up for Team Edition affects your
existing Google Docs and Google Calendar accounts. You'll probably want to move your documents
into your new account—which you can do by exporting the data from your other account's apps
(see the chapter that covers the specific app to learn how). And any new document and calendar
invitations you receive go to your Google Apps account, not to your Google Account's Docs and
Calendar.
Finally, you should know that first dibs on managing your Google Apps account always belong to
whoever owns or controls your organization's domain. So if the person who uses
ITAdmin@stateuniversity.com sets up a Google Apps account for the stateuniversity.com domain,
you'll see some changes. For example, only the admin (or people the admin gives administrative
privileges to) can make across-the-board changes like customizing how Google Apps looks,
inviting new users, changing default settings, or editing your organization's info. If your IT admin
takes over your organization's Google Apps account, your Team Edition account changes to
whatever edition that person choose for the domain (Google lets you know with a notification in
your Dashboard).
 

 
Part 4: Google Apps for Organizations
Chapter 10
Chapter 11
Chapter 12
Chapter 13
Chapter 10. Putting Google Apps to Work
So far, you've read about individual Google programs, like Docs, Gmail, and Calendar. Wouldn't it be great if
everyone in your company or that charity you volunteer at could do more than simply use these programs in a
haphazard, use-at-your-leisure manner? Sure, it's great that Carla in accounting uses Google Doc's spreadsheet
program, Phil in sales uses the presentation app, and a few folks use Gmail. But consider what happens when
you get everyone in the organization using Google Apps (with a capital A), the whole suite of programs and
services from Google:
Avoid the "Microsoft tax." Most companies spend a whole lotta money on software, and a lot of time
keeping it up to date. Google Apps accounts range from free to not-very-expensive-when-you-think-
about-it, and Google takes care of updates for you.
Customize your apps. You can add your logo to each app, and control how people can use them (like
whether they can share documents outside your organization).
Instant intranet. You can customize your company's Start Page ([click here]), which is like an iGoogle
page for your whole organization. You can add stuff to it like news from your central office, links to
commonly downloaded files, a calendar of company events, and so on (in other words, turn Start Page
into the much vaunted intranets that are beyond the reach of most small firms).
Google Apps comes in a few different flavors, including one that's free (Standard Edition—see [click here]). But
even the version they sell—the so-called Premier Edition—costs only $50 per year per person and gives you full
access to all the apps Google has to offer: email; word processing, spreadsheet, and presentation programs;
chat; a powerful calendar application; and ways to create public Web pages and sites for project teams. And
because you're getting your software as a service from Google, hosted on Google's computers and delivered to
you over the Internet, that saves you the hassle of having to buy, install, license, configure, and support all
those programs separately. You also don't have to worry about backups when Google's got your back. And the
ability to collaborate in real time makes using Apps a no-brainer. All you need is a domain name ([click
here])—that's a name for your company's Web site—and you can sign up for a Google Apps account.

NOTE
This chapter, along with Chapters 11 and 13, is aimed at techie types who want to manage a Google
Apps domain for their organizations. If you just use the individual apps described in Chapter 2–Chapter 9
and Chapter 12, or if your organization has a Google Apps account but you're not involved in managing
it, these chapters aren't aimed at you. They get pretty technical, so unless you want to learn about
domain aliases and APIs, you can skip to Chapter 12 ([click here]) or the appendix ([click here]).
Google employees use Google Apps, all the way up to management. And it's not just great for businesses—it
works just as well for other kinds of groups. Extended families, theater groups, softball leagues, friends of the
library, kennel clubs, the class reunion committee—any group that could benefit from Google's tools for
communication and collaboration can create a Google Apps account. You can create official email accounts for
your group's members, share calendars and invitations, and chat online with other members of the group. All
the good stuff that you get with Google's separate applications are rolled into one centralized, easy-to-
administer package.
This chapter tells you how to open and set up a Google Apps account (it takes less than 5 minutes to sign up).
It also walks you through customizing your domain before you roll Google Apps out across your organization, so
you can get everything just the way you want it. After that, you can add users and migrate your company's
email over to Google Apps, and you'll have a centralized place to manage a world of productivity.
10.1. Signing Up for Google Apps
To get started with your Google Apps account, head to the main Google Apps page, www.google.com/a. To
create your account, click one of the "Learn more" links. This gets you to the sign-up page shown in Figure 10-
1. Click the big blue "Compare Editions and Sign Up" button.
Figure 10-1. On the Google Apps welcome page, read about the goodies Google offers, if you like, or
just click the Compare Editions and Sign Up button (circled) to get started.

The page in Figure 10-2 opens with side-by-side comparisons of the different editions of Google Apps. (The box
on [click here] helps you decide which edition best fits your needs.) When you know which edition you want,
click its Sign Up button.
Figure 10-2. The comparison chart shown here gives you Google's summary of the various Google
Apps editions you can sign up for. Check out the box on [click here] for the Missing Manuals guided
tour through these options. Once you've chosen an edition, click its Sign Up button.

The page shown in Figure 10-3 opens, asking for your domain name. A domain name is your organization's
address on the Web, typically ending with .com, .net, or .edu. For example, google.com is Google's domain
name.
Figure 10-3. If your organization has a domain name, enter it here, and then click Get Started. If you
don't have a domain, you can buy one through Google for $10 a year (not rock-bottom pricing, but
fairly competitive with most mainstream domain name sellers). Click "I want to buy a domain name"
(circled), and read the info on [click here] to select and register a domain name through Google.

What you do next depends on whether your group already has a domain. If it does, read the next section; if not,
skip to [click here] to learn how to buy one through Google. (Having your own domain name lets you give
everyone in your group official-sounding email addresses—marty@petluggage.com,
darlene@babiesrule.com—among other perks.) Or, if you want to register with a domain you don't own, (like
shirley@notredame.edu) then hop to [click here].
NOTE
This chapter describes the sign-up process for the free, highly popular Standard Edition and gives a
general sense of what's involved in signing up and registering your site. The exact sign-in process differs
slightly depending on the edition you choose. For example, you need a credit card number to sign up for
the Premier Edition, and you need a federal Employer or Tax ID number to sign up for the Education
Edition.
Frequently Asked Question: Decisions, Decisions
Which edition of Google Apps is right for me?
The first decision you have to make when creating a Google Apps account is which edition makes
sense for your organization. Here's a guided tour to help you decide.
All three editions offer these basics: an iGoogle-style start page, Gmail, Google Talk, Calendar,

Docs, and Sites. You also get mobile access to all that stuff, an administrator's Control Panel to
manage your account, IMAP capabilities ([click here]) for Gmail, and online Help files and user
discussion groups.
That's how the editions are alike. Here are the differences:
Standard Edition. The big advantage here is cost: This edition is free—free as that lunch
they say doesn't exist. They also say you get what you pay for, and Standard Edition offers
"only" 6.5 GB of storage per Gmail account (that's quite a bit, but videos and other big
attachments munch a lot of megabytes); no phone support; no APIs ([click here]) to help
you integrate Google Apps with your existing infrastructure; and no policy management
([click here]), routing controls ([click here]), or migration tools for email ([click here]). Also,
email messages show targeted ads ([click here]); you can't turn them off. Still, it's free.
Standard Edition can be an excellent choice for small businesses, far-flung families, clubs,
and other groups that want to offer Google Apps' tools for keeping in touch and working (or
playing) together.
Premier Edition. You should know up front that Premier Edition will cost you: The current
price is $50 per user per year. (When you do the math, that works out to four dollars and
change monthly for each user. Compare that to your organization's licensing fees for all the
software it uses now.) When you pay that price, though, you get all the advantages of the
free Standard Edition and a whole lot more: free phone support (during business hours), 25
GB of storage for each Gmail account (and the ability to turn off ads), conference room and
resource scheduling for meetings, the ability to manage email policies and recover messages
via Postini ([click here]), and tools to help you integrate Google Apps with your company's
existing IT infrastructure and migrate your current email system to Gmail. With Premier
Edition, the first 30 days are free, so you can try it out and see whether your organization
needs the increased support and flexibility. When you purchase a Premier Edition account,
you pay for a full year's use for the number of users you specify. (The first year begins after
the 30-day free trial.) You can add more user accounts, but you can't get a refund for a
partial year's use or for deleting user accounts.
Education Edition. Although this is called Education Edition, it's also available to nonprofits.
(Nonprofits must prove federal 501(c)(3) status by giving Google their federal tax ID
numbers.) For schools and colleges with a .edu domain, or any verifiable nonprofit
organization, Education Edition combines the best of the Standard and Premier editions. In
fact, the only differences between the Premier and Education editions are the price
(Education Edition is free) and a few things about email: Education offers 6.5 GB of email
storage (compared to 25 GB for Premier) and there's no Postini-based policy management
and message recovery ([click here]).
To sign up your group or organization for any of these editions, you need to own or control
your organization's domain ([click here]). If you're part of a domain but you don't control
it—in other words, if you have an email address like me@mycompany.com but you're not
one of the anointed few who actually manage the mycompany.com domain—you can still
sign up for the Google Apps Team Edition and collaborate with other Google Apps users in
the mycompany.com domain. The box on [click here] tells you about Google Apps Team
Edition and how it differs from the editions listed here.
10.1.1. Route 1: You Already Own or Control a Domain
If your organization already owns a domain, Google asks whether you control the domain or simply use it:

If you control the domain. If you're a domain administrator with the power to upload HTML files or
make changes to the domain, turn on the Administrator radio button (shown back in Figure 10-3), and
then, in the "Enter your domain name" box, fill in your domain name: myvastdomain.com or
ourfamilydomain.net or localnonprofit.org—whatever domain you're registering.
If you don't control the domain. Maybe you know that other people in your school or organization
already use Google Apps—and you want to, too—but you don't have any authority to control or manage
the domain. For example, if your email address is something like student@mycollege.edu, you use the
mycollege.edu domain to get email, but you're not the IT Administrator who manages the domain for the
college. (Same goes if you have a work email address like me@mycompany.com.) If this sounds like you,
you can sign up for the Google Apps Team Edition—skip to [click here] to find out how.
Click Get Started. Google opens the sign-up form shown in Figure 10-4. For organizations or groups that have
their own domain name, Google asks for the following info:
Number of users. Put in your best ballpark guess here. You can always add users ([click here]) later.
Account Administrator. This section asks about the person who'll manage your new Google Apps
account. The person's name, email address, phone number, and country are all required. Optionally, you
can supply the administrator's job title. You also have to turn on the checkbox that says you understand
that if you're unable to change DNS records for this domain, Google Apps may not work properly.
Figure 10-4. Here's the registration form you see if you're an administrator of an existing domain,
and you're signing up for the Google Apps Standard Edition.

NOTE
DNS, which stands for "domain name system," is what translates domain names, like google.com or
mynewdomain.com, into IP addresses. An IP address is a group of numbers, like 123.45.67.89, that
indicates a computer's address on the Internet. (IP stands for "Internet protocol.") You need to be able
to change your domain's DNS records to activate email in your Google Apps account (see [click here]). If
you own a domain, you can change its DNS records.
Organization Information. This section is optional. You can give your organization's name and type,
size, and tell Google about its current email accounts (if any).

When you've filled out all the required information, click Continue. Google opens the third and final sign-up
page, shown in Figure 10-5. Here's what's on it:
Figure 10-5. Google needs some basic info to set up the account for your organization's Google Apps
administrator.
Your administrator account. Set up your Google Apps administrator account by choosing a user name
and password. Google asks whether you want to receive Google Apps tips and news at this administrator
account, and whether you're willing to provide feedback about your Google Apps experience. Turn on the
checkboxes as you prefer.
Terms and Conditions. Read through the Terms and Conditions presented here, and then click "I accept.

Continue with set up."
Google creates your Google Apps account, and opens your account Dashboard, shown in Figure 10-6. But you've
got one more step before you're cleared for take-off: verifying your domain, so Google knows it's really yours.
Figure 10-6. You can't activate the services in your Google Apps account until Google verifies your
domain. To verify, click the "Verify domain ownership" link (circled).
10.1.1.1. Verify your domain
When you open a Google Apps account for a domain that's registered outside of Google, you need to verify it.
Until you do, your Google Apps Dashboard displays a reminder to do so (you can see it in Figure 10-6). To verify
and get going, click the "Verify domain ownership" link at the top of the page. Google opens the page shown in
Figure 10-7.
Figure 10-7. Here's where you let Google know you have control over your domain. You've got two
different ways to verify your domain: create an HTML file with the name and content Google
specifies and upload it to your domain, or change a CNAME record for a subdomain (details in the
box on [click here]). Choose a method from the drop-down list, and then click Verify to get
instructions from Google.

Choose how you want to verify your domain:
Upload an HTML file. When you choose this option, Google gives you a name for an HTML file. Upload a
file with that name to your site so Google knows the site's legit.
Change your CNAME record. A CNAME record (see the box on [click here]) lives in your Domain
Management Settings, and lets you control a subdomain of your domain (for example,
blogs.catpower.com is a subdomain of catpower.com). If you choose this method, Google specifies a
CNAME record for you to use with your domain, and then checks the domain to see if it has that CNAME
record.
Click Verify. Whichever method you choose, Google specifies what you should upload or change. When you've
uploaded the HTML file or changed a CNAME record, click Verify again.
Google verifies your Web site by checking the change you made. This process may take as little as a few
minutes or as long as 48 hours. Be patient! Once you're verified, the verification notice disappears from the top
of the administrator's Dashboard. Even better, Google starts activating your apps: Start Page ([click here]),
Chat, Docs, Calendar, and Sites. (You have to activate email yourself—see [click here].)
Now that you've created a Google Apps account for your domain, you can sign into that account and start
managing it. Jump to [click here] to learn how.

Up to Speed: What's in a CNAME?
As explained in the Note on [click here], DNS translates domain names into numbers that
computers can understand. Sometimes, you might have several domain names which you want to
point at the same IP address because they're all hosted on the same server (like if you have your
main Web site at www.yourdomain.com, a blog at http://blog.yourdomain.com, and also host your
friend's Web site at www.theirdomain.com, but keep them all on the same server). But what if that
IP address needs to change? With standard DNS "A" records (which translate domain names into
IP addresses), you'd have to go into each individual domain and update its DNS entries to point to
the new IP address, which can be time consuming. Luckily, CNAMEs can save you some hassle.
CNAME is short for "canonical name", and is the name applied to DNS records that point from one
domain name (like www.yourdomain.com) or subdomains (like http://start.yourdomain.com) to
another domain name. So if, for example, you add a CNAME entry that points from
http://start.yourdomain.com to www.ghs.google.com, your browser will look for the DNS entry for
http://start.yourdomain.com, and get the IP address for www.ghs.google.com and go there,
instead. That way, you don't have to go into http://start.yourdomain.com and change its DNS
entry—the CNAME entry does the work for you.
Google Apps lets you change the URLs for your apps ([click here]) using CNAMEs. So if you don't
like the clunky Web address Google assigns your Start Page, you can change it to something like
start.yourdomain.com. (Google wants you to use CNAMEs so they can change the IP address for
the servers hosting your services without you needing to lift a finger.)
You can use CNAMEs in two ways within Google Apps:
To verify your domain during sign-up, by creating a subdomain or renaming an existing one
with a Google-specified CNAME ([click here]).
To customize the Web addresses of the apps in your account ([click here]).
10.1.2. Route 2: You Want to Buy a Domain from Google
Say you're ready to take advantage of all Google Apps has to offer, but your organization doesn't have a
domain name. No problem: Buy a domain name through Google for $10 per year. To go this route, you do have
to choose the Standard Edition to begin your sign-up process. (You can always upgrade to Premier later—[click
here] tells you how.)
To go straight to the Standard Edition sign-up page (shown in Figure 10-3), head to this URL:
www.google.com/a/cpanel/domain/new. Once you're there, here's now to register your domain name with
Google:
Click "I want to buy a domain name".
The page changes to look like Figure 10-8. This page is where you choose your domain name.
1.

In the box, type the domain name you want. From the drop-down list to its left, choose a top-level
domain—the part of your domain name that comes after the dot, like com or net or edu. Then click "Check
availability."
A page opens to let you know whether that domain name is available. If it's taken, Google suggests
similar, available alternatives. You can choose one of these by turning on its radio button, or you can think
up a different name and check its availability. If the name is available, then Google lets you know, and
reminds you that it costs $10 a year to register the name through Google.
0.
When you've found an available domain name you like, click "Continue to registration".
Google opens the sign-up page shown in Figure 10-9. To register your domain, Google needs the following
info:
Figure 10-8. The first step in buying a domain through Google is to find an available
domain name that you like. (If the name you want is taken, Google suggests
alternatives.)
Figure 10-9. Here's the form you fill out to register your domain.
1.

Privacy options. Like a massive Internet phone book, the WHOIS directory registers information
about domain names, including stuff about a domain's owner. This info is public, so anyone who
looks up your domain can find your contact information, including your phone number and address.
But becoming part of the WHOIS directory is optional, so if you'd rather not make that info publicly
available, leave the "Keep my registration information unlisted" checkbox turned on.
Name. Provide your first and last names.
Email address. Make sure this is a current email address—one that already works, not one you plan
to use for the new domain.
Type. How would you classify the domain you're creating: business, personal, or other?
Job title/Organization name. You have to fill in these fields if you're creating a business domain.
They're optional if you selected Other as the domain type, and you don't have to fill them in for a
personal domain.
Country. Choose a country from this drop-down list.

Address. The usual info: street, city, state or province, and Zip or postal code.
Phone number. Include your area code, and separate sections with hyphens, like this: 111-222-
3333.
Fax number. This info's optional.
I have read the GoDaddy.com Universal Terms of Service. Google registers domain names
through GoDaddy.com, one of the Internet's biggest domain registrars. Click the link to read the
terms. If you agree, turn on this checkbox.
Automatically renew my registration every year. When you own a domain name, you have to
renew its registration annually. Since you probably plan on having your domain hang around for a
while (or else you wouldn't be going to all this trouble to set it up), leave this checkbox turned on for
the convenience of automatic renewal.
When you've filled out the form, click "I accept. Proceed to Google Checkout."
A Google Checkout page opens, with your order for the domain name filled in. (Google Checkout is
Google's online shopping cart service.)
Provide your credit card info, check the total, and then click "Place your order now".
Google takes a moment to run your credit card. When it's done, it shows a confirmation page like the one
in Figure 10-10.
Figure 10-10. After you've paid the $10 registration fee, Google confirms your purchase.
Click either of the circled links to finish setting up Google Apps for your new domain.
2.

Click "Return to Google Apps" or "Click here to retrieve your purchase", and Google returns you to the
domain registration process.
Congratulations! You're now the proud owner of a brand-new domain. When Google takes you back to the
registration process, it takes you to the setup stage (shown in Figure 10-5), where you choose a user name and
password for your new domain. Provide those, click "Continue with setup" and Google whisks you right to your
Google Apps Dashboard. You can get started customizing your Apps account right away: add users ([click
here]), upload a logo ([click here]), or customize the domain's Start Page ([click here]).
NOTE
It might take Google a while to process the $10 payment for your domain. Until the payment clears,
Google doesn't activate any of the services in your domain (like Google Talk, Calendar, and so on). To
check on how your payment's coming along, sign into your Google Account, and then go to
http://checkout.google.com.
10.1.3. Route 3: You Want to Register Using a Domain You Don't Own
If you use a domain but don't own it—for example, if you're a student using your school's domain for email, like
joecollege@pennstate.edu—you're not locked out of the benefits of using Google Apps. You can sign up for the

Team Edition, which lets you set up your Google Apps the way you like them, and easily share with others in the
same domain (the box on [click here] gives you the lowdown on Team Edition).
To get started with the Team Edition, sign up using the same page you'd use for Standard Edition. (You can
point your browser straight to this address: www.google.com/a/cpanel/domain/new.) On the sign-up page
shown in Figure 10-3, turn on the "End-user" radio button. The page changes to ask for your email address;
type it in. (The email address must be the one you use through a business, organization, or school you're
affiliated with: me@aol.com doesn't work, for example, but me@localnonprofit.org does.) Then click Get
Started.
The sign-up page that opens, shown in Figure 10-11, collects this information:
Account Information. In this section, create a password for your Google Apps account, and then retype
the wavy green letters to prove you're a human being, not some kind of Web bot ([click here]).
Figure 10-11. The Google Apps Team Edition lets students and employees create a personal
Google Apps account for their school or work domain, even though they don't own those
domains.

NOTE
To keep your Google Apps account secure, make up a new password just for this account—don't
recycle the password you already use to sign in at work. For tips on creating a good password, see
the box on [click here].
Contact Information. Fill in your name and location.
Terms and Conditions. Read through the Terms of Service for creating a Google Apps account. (Click
Printable Version to open the terms in a new window that's a bit easier on the eyes.)
When you've filled out the form and are ready to move forward, click "I accept. Continue to Google Apps."
10.1.3.1. Verify your email address
When you submit the form shown in Figure 10-11, Google sends a verification email to the address you
supplied. To complete your sign-up for Google Apps Team Edition, zip over to your Inbox to find that verification
email. Open it, and then click the activation link it contains. This opens a new page, confirming that Google has
verified your address. Click "Click here to continue", sign in using the email address you supplied, and Google
takes you to your Team Edition Dashboard, shown in Figure 10-12.
Figure 10-12. Google Apps Team Edition's Dashboard is slightly different from other editions. From
here, you can customize your account's appearance, invite people to open their own Team Edition
accounts, and get started with the apps on the right side of the page: Google Sites, Docs, Calendar,
Start Page, and Chat.

Frequently Asked Question: One for the Team
What's Google Apps Team Edition, and how is it different from the Standard Edition?
If you're not the owner or administrator of the domain you're registering, Google signs you up for
Team Edition. This makes sense: Since you don't control your organization's domain, you can't just
go barging in and become the administrator of a Google Apps account for that domain. (The real
domain administrator might get kinda ticked off.)
Signing up for Team Edition gets you Google Docs, Talk, Calendar, Sites, and an iGoogle-style
personalized Start Page, and with Team Edition, you can take advantage of the centralized
collaboration and communication that Google Apps offers. Signing up for Team Edition links your
account with all the other Google Apps accounts within your organization. For example, if your
email address is joecollege@stateuniversity.edu, Team Edition automatically hooks you up with
everyone else who has an @stateuniversity.edu email address and a Google Apps account:
Easy access to all other Google Apps users in your organization through your Contacts list.
One-click sharing of documents with those contacts.
Easy sharing of your Google Calendar with everyone in your organization.

The ability to create team sites (Chapter 12) to share videos, documents, and other info with
a select group or your whole organization.
If you already have a Google Account (Chapter 1) and you use the same non-Gmail email address
to sign into the Google Account and Team Edition, then signing up for Team Edition affects your
existing Google Docs and Google Calendar accounts. You'll probably want to move your documents
into your new account—which you can do by exporting the data from your other account's apps
(see the chapter that covers the specific app to learn how). And any new document and calendar
invitations you receive go to your Google Apps account, not to your Google Account's Docs and
Calendar.
Finally, you should know that first dibs on managing your Google Apps account always belong to
whoever owns or controls your organization's domain. So if the person who uses
ITAdmin@stateuniversity.com sets up a Google Apps account for the stateuniversity.com domain,
you'll see some changes. For example, only the admin (or people the admin gives administrative
privileges to) can make across-the-board changes like customizing how Google Apps looks,
inviting new users, changing default settings, or editing your organization's info. If your IT admin
takes over your organization's Google Apps account, your Team Edition account changes to
whatever edition that person choose for the domain (Google lets you know with a notification in
your Dashboard).
 

 
10.2. Signing In and Learning Your Way Around
After you've created your Google Apps account, sign in by going to www.google.com/a, and then clicking the
upper-right "Returning user, sign in here" link. When you click the link, the page changes as shown in Figure 10-
13. Enter your domain name in the text box, and then click the drop-down list to choose where you want to go.
Figure 10-13. To sign into Google Apps, type in your domain name, choose your destination, and
then click the Go button.
To open your Google Apps account's Control Panel (described in the next section), select "Manage this domain,"
and then click Go. This takes you to the page shows in Figure 10-14.
Figure 10-14. Here's where you sign in to manage your domain. Type in the user name and password
you entered when you set up your Google Apps account ([click here]), and then click "Sign in".

10.2.1. A Quick Tour of the Control Panel
The Control Panel (shown opened to the Dashboard in Figure 10-15) is your control center for managing your
domain's Google Apps account. You can do a ton of stuff from here. This section gives a quick overview of the
Control Panel. Later in the chapter you'll find details on specific tasks like adding users ([click here]), adding
another domain ([click here]), and adjusting settings for all the services in your domain.
10.2.1.1. Dashboard
When you sign in to manage your domain, Google opens the Dashboard, shown in Figure 10-15. The starting
point for all your administrative activities, the Dashboard has two main sections: info about your domain, and
info about its apps.
Figure 10-15. The Dashboard is the landing page for your Google Apps Control Panel. From here, you
can keep an eye on user activity and manage individual apps.

10.2.1.1.1. Your domain
The top part of the Dashboard is a blue box that contains info about your domain:
Domain name. It's at the top of the box in big black letters, so you can't miss it.
Links to common management tasks. The Dashboard has shortcuts for speedy access to frequently
used Control Panel pages:
Manage account information. This link takes you to the Domain Settings page's General tab
([click here]).
Domain names. Click this link to add a domain alias ([click here]) to this domain, which you do
from the Domain Settings page's Domain Names tab.
Number of users. This link (which reads # users, where # is the actual number) helps you keep
track of how many folks use your domain. Click the link to go to the User Accounts page's Users tab
([click here]).
Create new users. When you want to add people to your domain—whether one or a dozen at a
time—click this link for easy access to the "Create a new user" page ([click here]).
Usage stats. Once you add people to your domain and they start using your apps, Google tells you how
many people have been using them, and how many are signed in now.

NOTE
The Dashboard's usage numbers aren't always accurate, so take them with a grain of salt (or even
a whole shaker). Google's still working out the kinks.
10.2.1.1.2. Service Settings
This section of the Dashboard lists the applications in your Google Apps account (Docs, Calendar, and so on).
Google activates most of these automatically; others—like email—you may have to turn on (but if you bought
your domain name through Google, Google turns on email for you). Click an app's name to go to its Settings
page. Click the "Add more services" link to include more applications in your account. (Currently, you can only
add Web Pages—the Google Apps version of Page Creator, discussed in Chapter 9—but who knows what else
Google may decide to add in the future.) You also go to this section to turn on email for your domain ([click
here] tells you how).
For each Google tool listed in this section, you see its current status (active or not active) and the URL where
users sign in. (You can customize this address, as [click here] explains.)
10.2.1.2. User Accounts
As you might suspect from its name, you go to this page to manage people's accounts. As Figure 10-16 shows,
this page has two tabs: Users and Settings.
Figure 10-16. As you add folks to your domain, they appear in the list on the Users tab (circled).
10.2.1.2.1. Users

The main feature of the Users tab is the list of users, which takes up most of the page. As you add people to
your domain, they show up on this list. Links across the top of the page let you add new users (individually or in
bulk), find a person's email address, create an email list ([click here]), and ask Google to create more user
accounts for your domain.
10.2.1.2.2. Settings
The User Accounts page's Settings tab lets you turn contact sharing on or off for the users within your domain.
Contact sharing automatically creates a shared address book for all the people in your domain, so everyone has
everyone else's email address.
For more about contact sharing, see [click here].
10.2.1.3. Domain Settings
There's a lot you can do on the Domain Settings page, shown in Figure 10-17. This page has four tabs: General,
Account Information, Domain Names, and Appearance.
Figure 10-17. The Domain Settings page gives you the scoop on how your account's set up. You can
view and edit account-related info here.

10.2.1.3.1. General
The Domain Settings page's General tab lets you adjust these aspects of your domain:
Organization name. If your company merges and gets a new name (or if you made a typo during the
Google Apps sign up process), change its name here. Just type the new name into the text box.
User support. Is there a particular phone number, help page, or list of email addresses the people who
use your domain should look to when they run into problems? Type the necessary info here, and Google
makes it available to them.
Language. This setting determines the language Google uses to communicate with people in your
domain.
Time zone. Select a time zone for your domain.
NOTE

Individuals can adjust language and time zone settings for their own accounts.
New Services and Features. One of the cool things about Google Apps is that new services and features
appear automatically—you don't have to upgrade anything. Google lets you decide how to handle the new
stuff it offers:
Automatically add new Google services. From time to time, Google welcomes a new member
into the Google Apps family. If you want to be first kid on your block to try a new Google service,
leave this checkbox turned on. (If, on the other hand, you don't want new stuff dropping into your
domain without an invitation, turn it off.)
Turn on new features. Sometimes, Google launches a new feature to the world at large (like group
chat in Google Talk or colored labels in Gmail) before they work perfectly in Apps. If you want to add
such new features as they emerge, turn on this checkbox. If you'd rather your Apps stick with the
tried and true, leave it off.
Control Panel. Google is always fine-tuning its programs. Google tends to make improvements in English
first, and then expand those changes to other languages. If you set your domain's language to U.S.
English, then you can sign up to get new Control Panel features before Google rolls them out for the rest
of the world. Turn on the "Next generation" radio button to be first in line for new Control Panel goodies. If
your domain's default language isn't U.S. English—or if you're not in a hurry to try out new features—turn
on "Current version" (in other words, you're telling Google you're content to stick with the latest,
universally available version of a program).
NOTE
The "Next-generation" Control Panel is available only to domains using U.S. English as the default
language. If you sign up for this option, then Google prevents anyone who's been granted
administrative privileges in your domain ([click here]) from setting his own version of the Control
Panel to another language.
10.2.1.3.2. Account Information
The Domain Settings page's Account Information tab has these sections:
Account type. This lists your current edition of Google Apps. If you use Standard or Education Edition,
you can upgrade to Premier by clicking the Upgrade link. This is also where you go if you decide to delete
your Google Apps account (along with all the user accounts, documents, and data that belong to it—so
tread carefully). If you have Premier Edition, you can buy additional user accounts here.
Admin support. Google Apps offer lots of resources for getting help: a Help section for administrators,
another for regular users, and an active discussion group on a slew of topics. This section has links to the

Help center and the Google Apps Discussion Group. It also lists a support PIN (password). Standard
Edition administrators can use their PINs when they email the Google Apps team to request support.
Premier and Education edition administrators also get a support phone number they can call.
NOTE
For security reasons, Google changes your domain's support PIN from time to time. Before you
request support, make sure you have the current one.
Secondary contact. This shows the email address you provided when you set up your Google Apps
account. The secondary contact must be an email address outside the domain involved in this account.
The checkbox in this section (which is on by default) tells Google to send info about resetting your
password to the secondary address if you forget your administrator password.
Email notifications. Google occasionally sends out announcements of new Google Apps services or
features. To stay in the loop, make sure this checkbox is turned on.
Feedback. When you signed up with Google Apps, you told Google whether you wanted Google to ask for
your feedback, and this setting reflects that choice. If you have a change of heart, then use the checkbox
in this section to let Google know.
NOTE
When you makes changes to any of the tabs on the Domain Settings page, don't forget to save
your changes by clicking "Save changes" before you leave the page.
10.2.1.3.3. Domain Names
The Domain Settings page's Domain Names tab shows your account's primary domain (the one you used to sign
up) and any domain aliases you have. A domain alias is another domain name that's associated with your
primary domain and works with your primary domain's user accounts; [click here] explains domain aliases in
detail, and teaches you how to add them to your Google Apps account.
10.2.1.3.4. Appearance
Google Apps lets the domain administrator (that's you) give a standardized look to all your Google apps. If you
want to add your company's logo to everybody's apps, you can do that on the Domain Settings page's
Appearance tab, shown in Figure 10-20 ([click here] gives you step-by-step instructions for customizing your
domain's look).
10.2.1.4. Advanced Tools

What you see on this page depends on your edition. Standard Edition administrators have one advanced tool,
for bulk uploading users ([click here]). This is a little bit of a cheat, because you can also get instructions for
bulk uploading on the User Accounts page—but it wouldn't look good for Google to leave this page completely
empty in the Standard Edition.
NOTE
If you don't have Premier Edition, the rest of this section doesn't apply to you (and it gets pretty
technical), so skip ahead to [click here].
Premier Edition admins have a lot more goodies to choose from, as Figure 10-18 shows. If you pay for Premier
Edition (or take Google up on its offer of a 30-day free trial), you currently get these advanced tools (in addition
to Standard Edition's bulk-upload feature):
Single sign-on. This tool lets people in your domain sign into their Google apps through your network,
giving you full control over authenticating and authorizing your users. You control user names, passwords,
and other info that authenticates people who use Google's Web applications. See [click here] for more
about SSO.
Figure 10-18. Premier Edition administrators get these advanced tools for managing their
domains.

Email migration. This tool lets you copy email from your IMAP server and bring it into Google Apps;
[click here] tells you how to migrate email into Google from an existing email setup.
NOTE
IMAP stands for "Internet message access protocol" and is an increasingly popular method for
reading and manipulating email messages stored on a server. The box on [click here] has more
about IMAP.
API references (see Chapter 13 for more about the Google API):
Provisioning API. This tool (described in detail on [click here]) gets Google Apps and your
organization's existing user management system in sync, so you can manage user accounts
automatically.
Reporting API. Need reports on Google Apps data? This tool gets that data into your organization's
reporting system. See [click here] for more.
Email migration API. Use this tool to move email from your previous system into Google Apps
Email accounts.
User email uploads. If you (or your IT administrator) prefer do-it-yourself email migration, without
relying on Google's tools, make sure the checkbox labeled "Allow users to upload mail using the Email
Migration API" is turned off.
10.2.1.5. Service Settings
This isn't a page of its own; it's a drop-down list, like the one in Figure 10-19, which shows all your Google
services. To change the settings for a particular service, select it from the drop-down list. Chapter 11, which
focuses on administering your applications, covers the Settings page for each kind of app.
Figure 10-19. When you click the Service Settings button, you get this drop-down list of the different
services in your account. Select one to tweak its settings.

 

 
10.3. Customizing Your Domain
In Google Apps, you're the undisputed ruler of your domain, and you get to set up your domain just the way
you want it. Google Apps offers a wide array of customization options: You can put your organization's logo on
all the apps, create custom sign-in addresses that are easy to remember, and design a Start Page for everyone
in the domain to use. This section offers a look at how you can personalize your domain; Chapter 11 tells you
how to modify individual applications.
10.3.1. Customizing the Domain's Appearance
Sure, Google provides the programs, but it's your domain. So go ahead and customize its look to reflect your
organization by adding a logo or changing the color of the Google Apps sign-in box.
10.3.1.1. Add a logo
Organizations work hard to build their brands, creating logos that are eye-catching, memorable, and
immediately associated with a company. When you think of well-known companies like FedEx, Coca-Cola, Nike,
and, of course, Google, you can probably picture their logos without much effort. Displaying your firm's logo
throughout your domain brings that kind of presence to your apps. At the very least, seeing the logo reminds
employees that they're supposed to be working.
Before you add a logo to all the Google services in your domain, here are some pointers you need to know:
Your logo should be 143 x 59 pixels in size, or smaller. If the image is bigger than that, then Google crops
or resizes it, and you probably won't like the result.
Your logo should be in .png or .gif format.
Make sure you have the right to use the logo. That means you can't "borrow" a cool-looking logo from
someone else's Web site. Similarly, you can't use the words Google or Gmail anywhere in your logo—those
belong to Google.
You can, however, use the phrase "Powered by Google" in your logo, or anywhere on the pages within
your domain. But it has to be that exact phrase.
When you've got a logo that's the right size and in the right format, follow these steps to add it to your domain:
In your Google Apps Control Panel, click Domain Settings
Appearance.
The Domain Settings page's Appearance tab, shown in Figure 10-20, opens. The "Header logos" section
shows Google's familiar logos. Below them is a Custom logo box. This box is empty until you upload your
logo to your Google Apps account.
1.

Figure 10-20. You can use Google's standard logos or create your own.
Turn on the "Custom logo" radio button, and then click the Browse button. Find your logo on your
computer, click Open, and then click Upload to get a copy into your Google Apps account.
Your logo appears in the Custom logo box.
2.
Click "Save changes".
Google makes your logo the default. From now on, anyone working with Google Apps through your
domain will see your logo in place of the usual Google logo, as Figure 10-21 shows.
It may take an hour or so before you see the new logo. If you open a Google
program and don't see your new custom logo, try refreshing your browser (click its
Refresh button) or clearing its cache ([click here]).
3.
Figure 10-21. Once you add a custom logo, it appears in place of Google's in all the apps in your
domain. Here, you see what that looks like in Google Docs.

NOTE
You customize your domain's Start Page separately. To find out how to put your logo across the top of
that page (and fool around with some other design options), see [click here].
10.3.1.2. Choose a sign-in box color
You can also customize your domain's appearance by choosing a color for the box people use to sign in. Google
chose to make the sign-in box green, but maybe you'd prefer a color that complements your company's logo.
After all, corporations spend a lot of money choosing the colors they want people to associate with their firms.
You can make the sign-in box whatever color you like:
From your domain's Control Panel, select Domain Settings
Appearance.
The Domain Settings page's Appearance tab opens, as shown in Figure 10-20.
1.
Scroll down to the "Sign-in box color" section, shown in Figure 10-22. Select a color combo for the sign-in
box's border and background. You can use one of Google's suggestions or create your own, using
hexadecimal color values, which are six-character codes that tell browsers what mix of red, green, and
blue to display. For example, the hexadecimal color value for white is FFFFFF; for pure red it's FF0000,
and for cornflower blue it's 6495ED. You can find a table showing popular colors and their codes at
www.htmlhelp.com/cgi-bin/color.cgi.
2.

Figure 10-22. To change the color of the box people use to sign into the apps in your domain, make a
selection or type in your own custom colors.
Click "Save changes".
Google changes the color of the sign-in box.

10.3.2. Creating Custom Sign-in Addresses
When you create a Google Apps account for your domain, Google assigns each program in your domain a Web
address that looks something like this: http://partnerpage.google.com/yourdomain.com (for Start Page) or
http://docs.google.com/a/yourdomain.com (for Docs). These big, clunky URLs aren't easy to remember. You
could tell everyone to bookmark these pages, but there's an easier way: Change the URLs to something more
intuitive (and therefore easier to remember).
For example, instead of http://partnerpage.google.com/yourdomain.com, you can give your Start Page this
custom address: http://start.yourdomain.com. For Docs, the custom address becomes the shorter, easier-to-
remember http://docs.yourdomain.com. Makes sense, right? The URL shows the app and the domain, without a
lot of other junk thrown in.

NOTE
You need to be able to create CNAME records with your domain host to create custom URLs for your
apps. The box on [click here] tells you all about CNAME records.
You create a custom sign-in page for an app from the Control Panel's "Service settings" menu. The process is a
bit convoluted, but it's worth it to make things easier for your users. Here are the steps you need to take:
In the Control Panel, click "Service settings". From the menu that appears, select the app whose sign-in
address you want to customize.
Google opens the Settings page for the app you chose (Figure 10-23 shows an example). The Web
address section shows the current sign-in URL.
1.
Figure 10-23. Click the Change URL link to start the process for simplifying an app's sign-in address.
0.

In the Web address section, click the Change URL link.
Google opens the Change URL page for that app, as shown in Figure 10-24. This page shows two URLs.
The top one is the address Google created for you when you set up Google Apps for your domain. The
bottom one is the custom address you're creating. You get to decide what word to insert in front of your
domain name. The example in Figure 10-24 uses http://start.theconnercorp.com as the address for that
domain's Start Page. You can either go with Google's suggestion (probably the best idea) or type
something else in the text box.
0.
Figure 10-24. Turn on the radio button next to the custom URL you're creating. Google makes a good
suggestion for the URL here (in this example, it's start to indicate Start Page), but you can change it
if you like. To customize the URLs of all your apps at once, click the "Change URLs for all domain
services" link (circled), and then continue the customization process, but for multiple apps.
To change the addresses for all the applications in your domain in one fell swoop, click
"Change URLs for all domain services" near the top of any app's Change URL page. A
page opens that lets you select and change the URLs of all your apps (or any
combination of them). The process is the same as the steps for changing a single URL,
but the page lists all the apps in your domain, instead of just one.
Turn on the radio button next to the custom URL, and then click Continue.
Google opens a page that lists step-by-step instructions for changing a CNAME record, shown in Figure
10-25.
0.

Figure 10-25. If a company besides Google hosts your domain (Register.com, for example), then you
need to follow these steps to change CNAME records with your domain host before people can use
your custom URL. When you've successfully changed the CNAME record with your host, click "I've
completed these steps" (circled) so Google can verify the change.
For the next part of the process, you have to navigate away from Google. Open a new browser window
and sign into the Web page where you manage your domain settings. The steps that follow may vary
somewhat, because different Web hosting firms are set up differently. From your domain's administration
page, click the link to get to the page where you manage DNS settings ([click here]). Look for a link called
something like Manage DNS or Advanced Settings.
A management page for DNS settings opens.
0.
Find your domain's CNAME settings. You might have to poke around a bit to find them. If you see an
option such as Edit DNS Settings, try that. Once you've found the CNAME settings for your domain, type in
a CNAME alias and destination:
The CNAME alias is the new name you want to put at the beginning of the URL, such as start for
Start Page or docs for Google Docs.
1.

The CNAME destination is ghs.google.com.
Tell your domain host to update your CNAME settings.
Your domain host updates the settings. You can sign out of your domain host's site now, if you like.
Go back to the Changing CNAME Record page in Google Apps and click the "I've completed these steps"
button.
Google verifies the changes with your domain host, and creates your custom URL.
2.
Now, the sign-in pages for your apps are easier to find. When someone points a Web browser to, for example,
http://start.yourdomain.com, she'll land on your Start Page.
10.3.3. Setting up Single Sign-on (Premier and Education Editions Only)
As its name suggests, single sign-on (SSO) lets the members of your domain access all its services by signing in
just once. (Otherwise, they have to sign into each individual Google service they want to use.) For SSO, Google
uses something called SAML (short for "Security Assertion Markup Language"), which lets Web domains
exchange user authentication and authorization data (like passwords and user names) securely. That means
your organization gets complete control over how people sign into Google Apps services through your Web site.
In other words, Google provides the programs (like Docs and Calendar), and you control who can use them.
Setting up SSO is really a matter for your IT folks. (If you don't have an IT department, you probably don't need
SSO.) To get an idea of the info you need to set up SSO, sign into the Control Panel, and then select "Advanced
tools"
"Set up single sign-on (SSO)". This gets you to the page shown in Figure 10-26. Turn on the "Enable
Single Sign-on" checkbox, and then provide the following required information:
The addresses of the pages you want to use for authentication:
Sign-in page URL.
Sign-out page URL.
Change password URL.
A verification certificate, so Google can verify sign-in requests.
Figure 10-26. The Premier and Education editions offer SSO, which lets your users sign into and out
of their apps using the same username and password that your organization uses for other
applications.

But there's a lot more to setting up SSO than that, and the set-up process varies simply because different
companies do things differently. For a detailed explanation of what you need to do to set up SSO, at the top of
the setup page, click the SSO Reference link. The reference page tells you (or someone who speaks IT)
everything you need to know to get SSO working.
10.3.4. Setting Up Your Domain's Start Page
Before you start adding people to your Google Apps account, you want to make sure your apps are ready for
them. The Start Page is where most people sign into your domain, because they can easily get to all the apps
from there. Start Page is the Google Apps equivalent of iGoogle (Chapter 8), with one big difference: You get to
decide how it looks to everyone in your domain (they can't pick a theme or add tabs like in iGoogle). For
example, you can design Start Page's look and unfurl your company's logo across the top.
When you set up a Start Page, you can add stuff that everyone will see when they first use Start Page. But folks
in your domain can customize their Start Pages, selecting, removing, and rearranging content as they please.
So don't count on everyone keeping their email inboxes in the upper-left corner just because you put it there.
NOTE
Google Apps admins used to be able to lock Start Page's left column so that people couldn't move or

delete the gadgets in that column. But Google stopped offering this ability for accounts created after
November 19, 2007. No word on whether they'll reinstate locked columns.
To get started designing your domain's Start Page, go to the Control Panel, and then select Service settings
Start Page
Customize. The Start Page Editor, shown in Figure 10-27, opens. From here, Google walks you
through the process of designing your page.
Figure 10-27. This page shows the different parts of Start Page you can customize: Colors, Header
and Footer, and Content. Click the links at the top of the page (circled), and Google walks you
through the customization process.
10.3.4.1. Choose your colors
In the Start Page Editor, click the Colors link to open the page shown in Figure 10-28. In the top part of the
page is a drop-down list of all the different things you can colorize. (Some elements already have colors
selected by Google; you can change these if you like.) To the right of that list, you see a palette of available
colors. Below this section is a preview that changes as you make your selections.
Figure 10-28. To add some color to Start Page, select the page element you want (background, text,
links, and so on), and then click a color in the palette. As you make changes, the preview shows how

they'll look.
When you select something from the drop-down list, Google outlines Start Page's corresponding section in the
preview, so you can see where you're working. Click any page element in the list, and then click a color in the
palette. The preview changes to show the color you selected. Work your way through the list of page elements,
selecting the colors you want. (Don't overdo it! There's a reason people like Google's classic Search page—it's
easy on the eyes.)
Google saves your changes automatically as you work. If you want to see how your changes will look on your
actual Start Page, click the upper-right Preview link to open Start Page in a new window.
When you're pleased with the colors you've chosen, click "Header and Footer" (at the top of the page) or "Next:
Header and Footer" (at the bottom of the page) to move to the next step.
Figure 10-29. Start Page's standard header is a little plain. You can edit the text or upload an image
to make it more interesting. If you know HTML, then click the Edit HTML link to edit the header that
way.

10.3.4.2. Design a header and footer
On the Header and Footer tab, shown in Figure 10-29, you can design the top and bottom of your Start Page.
When you first create a Google Apps account, Google makes your domain name the Start Page header in a
large, bold font. You'll probably want to change that to make it look a bit more welcoming:
Change or format the header's text. To make changes to the header using this page's text editor, just
click the header section, and then start typing.
Upload an image for the header. If you've got a logo or banner that would look great on your Start
Page, click the far-left Image button to put it across the top of your Start Page. When the "Add an Image"
box opens, you can browse for a file that lives on your computer, or type in a URL where Google can find
the image. Click Add Image, and Google inserts the image into your header. Once it's there, click the
image to change its size or remove it.
The bottom part of the page controls what's in your page's footer. Google requires that your footer have the
Privacy Policy, Terms of Service, and Help links (so don't try to get rid of them). You can add other links, like
Policies, Contact Human Resources, Tech Support—anything people may need easy access to. Click "Add a link
to the footer", and the Edit Link box, shown in Figure 10-30, opens.
Figure 10-30. If you've added links in Docs or Page Creator, this box should look familiar. Use it to
add helpful links to the Start Page's footer.

In the top part of the Edit Link box, type in the text that will contain the link, like Email HR or Employee
Handbook. Choose the kind of link you want—to a Web page or to an email address—and then type or paste in
the URL or email address. (For URLs, click "Test this link" to see if it works.) Click OK, and Google adds the
linked text to your footer.
After you've added a link or two to the footer, you can edit, move or remove them. Click the link you want to
change, and a blue box opens, showing the link's target. From there, take one of these actions:
Visit the link. For links to Web pages, click the target URL to open that page in a new browser window.
Edit the link. Click Change to open the Edit Link box, and then make any necessary changes.
Remove the link. To delete the link from the footer, click Remove.
Move the link. If you want to rearrange the links in the footer, click a left or right arrow to move the link
over one place. You can move any link in the footer, including the Google-mandated ones.
When you're done working with the header and footer, click Content (at the top of the page) or "Next: Content"
(at the bottom) to select the stuff that goes in the main part of Start Page.
10.3.4.3. Select content
Start Page comes with some suggested stuff already on it, which you can see on Start Page Editor's Content
tab, shown in Figure 10-31. If you don't like Google's suggestions, you can change Start Page's built-in content
to anything you want.
Figure 10-31. Here's the default selection of gadgets ([click here]), the mini-programs that provide
content to your Start Page. Click "Add stuff" (circled) to choose your own gadgets from Google's
wide selection.

Adding content to Start Page is a lot like adding gadgets to iGoogle (Chapter 8). Click the right-hand "Add stuff"
link, find the gadget you want, and then click its "Add it now" button.
For example, say you want to add the Google Docs gadget to your domain's Start Page, so folks can have one-
click access to their documents. On the "Add stuff" page, look in the left-hand menu for Google Apps, and click
it. The page shown in Figure 10-32 opens, listing all the gadgets for Google Apps that you can put on your Start
Page. (Some might already be there.) Find Google Docs, click "Add it now", and Google adds the Docs gadget to
your Start Page. In the meantime, you're still on the "Add stuff" page so you can browse more gadgets.
Figure 10-32. Under Google Apps (circled, left), Google offers a number of gadgets designed to give
people easy, centralized access to the services in their Apps account. To see the gadgets on the Start
Page you're creating, click "Refresh default content below" (circled, right).

To see what you've added, click the right-hand "Refresh default content below" link, and any gadgets you've
selected (like Google Docs in the example) appear on Start Page. From there, you can move ([click here]), edit
([click here]), or remove ([click here]) gadgets as you like, just as you would in iGoogle.
10.3.4.4. Optional: Create custom sections
There are a lot of fun and useful gadgets you can put on your domain's Start Page. But you might have
something in mind that's specific to your organization, such as news releases, service updates, or a VP's blog
posts. To add this kind of content to Start Page, you create a custom section, and then fill it with the stuff you
want. The steps you take to create a custom section depends on the kind of content you want to add:
Static text and images. If the content changes only occasionally and doesn't need as-it-happens
updates, create this kind of custom section.
Dynamic content. If the content updates frequently (an RSS feed [[click here]], for example), this is the
kind of custom section you need.
Programmed sections. To add gadgets others have developed, create this kind of section. You can
create custom sections yourself (or have your organization's developers create them) using the Google
Gadgets API ([click here]).
The following pages describe how to create each kind of custom section. No matter which kind you want,
though, start on the Add Stuff page, and then click the right-hand "Create custom content" link shown in Figure
10-32. This step opens the Create Custom Section box shown in Figure 10-33.

Figure 10-33. To get started creating a custom section, choose the kind of content you want to add.
10.3.4.4.1. Create a custom section for static text and images
In the Create Custom Section box, when you turn on the "Static text, images, and links" radio button, the box
expands to look like the one in Figure 10-34. In the "Section title" box, type a name for the custom section. This
text will appear in the section's title bar.
Figure 10-34. You create a custom section to hold static content using the text editor Google
provides.

Below the section title is a row of formatting buttons and a tiny space for text. Click inside the text area, and
then start typing (the area expands as you type). Use the formatting buttons to format the text, and add
images and links. When you're done, click Create Section.
Later, if you want to change what you put in this section, you can edit it, just as you would an iGoogle gadget
([click here]).
10.3.4.4.2. Create a custom section for dynamic content
When you want to add content that changes frequently, like a newsfeed ([click here]), in the Create Custom
Section box, turn on the radio button labeled "Frequently updated content section". The box expands, as shown
in Figure 10-35. Give the custom section a title (which will appear in its title bar). Below that, type or paste in
the Web address of the feed you want the section to display. (Click "test URL" if you want to make sure the
address is good.) Click Create Section, and Google does just that.
Figure 10-35. To show custom newsfeeds or blog posts on your Start Page, tell Google where to get
the feed.

10.3.4.4.3. Create a custom section for a custom gadget
As Chapter 13 explains, the Google's collection of APIs (application programming interfaces) is an only-geeks-
need-apply system for letting programs communicate with each other. APIs let people who don't work for
Google build applications that work with Google's programs in various ways. The Google Gadgets API lets
developers build gadgets that work with iGoogle and Start Page.
You can find the Google APIs at http://code.google.com.
If you've got some gadgets (created by you or someone else) that aren't part of Google but live somewhere on
the Web, then you can add them to your Start Page. In the Create Custom Section box, turn on the Google
Gadget radio button. The box expands, as Figure 10-36 shows. Give the section a title (for its title bar), and
then tell Google where it can find the gadget by typing the URL for its code. Test the URL (it opens in a new
window) if you want to check it. When all looks good, click Create Section.
Figure 10-36. If you want to add a custom gadget from outside Google, in the "Enter URL of section
code" text box, type or paste its URL.

Whatever kind of custom section you chose, Google creates your section, and then returns you to the content
directory. From there, you can add your new custom Section to the Start Page by clicking its "Add it now"
button.
When you're done adding content (custom or regular), click the upper-left "Back to homepage" link. From there,
you're ready for the last step in customizing Start Page: publishing it. Click the Publish link at the top of the
page or "Next: Publish" at the bottom.
10.3.4.5. Publish your Start Page
The Start Page Editor's Publish tab, shown in Figure 10-37, is where you launch your customized Start Page into
the world. The top part of the page shows the URL for your Start Page. (If you've customized its address [[click
here]], the URL looks different from the one you see in the figure.)
Figure 10-37. Whether you've customized the Start Page for the first time or just made a minor
tweak or two, you publish it from here. You can get to this page at any point in the customization
process by clicking the upper-right Publish link (circled) from anywhere in the Start Page Editor.

If you want to view your page one last time before it goes live, click the upper-right Preview link to open the
preview in a new window. To activate your customized Start Page, click the Publish Updates button. Figure 10-
38 shows an example of a customized Start Page.
Figure 10-38. Here's a customized Start Page, with a company logo at the top, custom content, and
Google Apps gadgets.

 

 
10.4. Adding Users
Your Google Apps account isn't good to go until you've added some users to it. Google gives you two ways to
add people to your Google Apps account: one at a time or in bulk. This section walks you through both
methods.
NOTE
If you use Premier Edition, then you purchased a certain number of user accounts, so you can add only
as many users as you bought accounts for. If you need to purchase more user accounts, skip ahead to
[click here] to find out how.
10.4.1. Add Users Individually
If you've got just a person or two to add, you can easily add them one at a time:
In the Control Panel, select "User accounts"
"Create a new user". Or, if you're on the Dashboard, click
the "Create new users" link.
The "Create a new user" page, shown in Figure 10-39, opens. This page collects info about the person and
generates a random, temporary password for him until he resets it.
1.
Figure 10-39. Google asks for the basics to create a new user account: the person's name and a user
name for him. You can use Google's randomly generated password or create one of your own by
clicking "Set password" (circled).

Type in the person's name and the user name for his new Google Apps Email address. If you want to
assign a password, rather than use Google's temporary one, click "Set password"; when the section
expands, type the password twice. Then click the "Create new user" button.
Google creates a new user account and opens a confirmation page like the one in Figure 10-40.
NOTE
When you're creating an account, keep in mind that Google Apps user names can contain letters,
numbers, hyphens (-), underscores (_), and periods (.). Unlike Gmail ([click here]), Google Apps
does recognize periods in user names.
0.
Figure 10-40. After Google creates a new account, it confirms the info you submitted. To share that
info with the owner of that account, click Print instructions or Email instructions (both circled). From
this page, you can edit this person's account or create another new account.

The new account isn't much good if the user doesn't know about it. You have two options for passing on info
about the new account:
Print instructions. Click this link to print a copy of the account info, including the user name, temporary
password, email address, and Start Page URL. This link is also useful if you want to file a paper record of
the account you set up.
Email instructions. When you click this link, a new window opens like the one shown in Figure 10-41,
containing an email with account information that Google will send to the new user. Type in the recipient's
email address (don't use the one you just created, since he doesn't know how to access it yet), and then
customize the message if you like. Click Send Instructions, and the email whizzes off through cyberspace.
Click Done to close the confirmation box.
Figure 10-41. When you send an email notification to a new user, Google lets you customize the
message.

After you've created a new user account, you can edit the settings for that account ([click here]) or create
another one. Just click the "Create another user", and then repeat the process until you've added all the
accounts you need for now.
10.4.2. Add Users in Bulk
If you've got a whole group of users to add, you don't want to go through the tedium of adding them one at a
time—you'd wear out your clicking finger before you make it halfway through the list. Fortunately, Google Apps
is smart enough to let you add a bunch of users all at once by importing a CSV file.
CSV, which stands for "comma-separated values", is a file format that holds spreadsheet data, with pieces of
information marked off by commas. CSV format makes it a snap to export data from one spreadsheet program
and import it into another—and to import users into Google Apps.
The first step is to create a spreadsheet (or edit an existing one) with up-to-date user info. For a smooth
import, your spreadsheet needs to have these column headings:
username
first name

last name
password
Figure 10-42 shows an example. As you probably noticed, the column headings are the same fields that appear
on the "Create a new user" form (Figure 10-39); they represent the basic info Google needs to create a new
Apps account for your domain. When you've got everyone's info listed, save the spreadsheet as a CSV file.
Figure 10-42. Make sure the column headings in your spreadsheet match the fields Google uses to
create user accounts.
Now you're ready to add these users:
In the Google Apps Control Panel, click "User accounts"
"Upload many users at once".
Google opens the Bulk Account Update page, shown in Figure 10-43. This page has instructions for
creating a CSV file. You've already done that, so skip down to the next section of the page, where you
choose update options for the import. Google automatically creates new accounts for user names it
doesn't recognize (you can't turn this checkbox off). Optionally, you can update existing accounts with the
new info you're importing (in other words, if Google recognizes someone on your list, it'll change her
account info so it matches what's on the list) and require users to change their passwords the first time
they sign into Google Apps.
1.
Choose the update options you want.
2.
To import users, click the Browse button, find the CSV file you created, and then click Open.
3.

Click the "Upload and Continue" button.
Google uploads the data and opens a confirmation page showing your data in table form.
4.
If the table looks good—the column headings are correct and the right info is in each column—click
Confirm and Run Update. (If there's a problem, go back and edit your spreadsheet, save it as a CSV file
again, and then click "Upload a different file" to upload the revised file and try again.)
Google starts updating your account. The time it takes for the update varies—maybe a couple of minutes
if you're importing a dozen users to a day or longer if you're importing a whole boatload. When it's
completed the update, Google sends a report about the update to your Apps administrator's email
account.
5.
Figure 10-43. Google's bulk upload process involves three main steps: create a CSV file, choose your
update options, and upload the CSV file.

10.4.3. Add More Accounts
If you need more user accounts than your edition of Google Apps can currently hold, what you do depends on
your edition: You can either request (Standard and Education Editions) or purchase (Premier Edition) more
accounts to expand your domain.
10.4.3.1. Standard and Education Editions
To request more Google Apps accounts, follow these steps:
In the Control Panel, click "User accounts".
The User Account page opens (you saw it back in Figure 10-16).
1.
Click the "Request more users" link.
The "Request for More Users" page, shown in Figure 10-44, opens.
2.
Tell Google how many more user accounts you need and why you need them (such as company growth),
and then click the "Save changes" button.
Google sends your request to the Apps team, which takes a look at your request and decides whether to
give you more accounts. When the team makes a decision, it sends an email to your administrator's
account to let you know.
3.
Figure 10-44. Google doesn't grant more user accounts indiscriminately. You have to tell Google how
many more accounts you need, and why you need them.

10.4.3.2. Premier Edition
If you have Premier Edition, once you reach your user limit, you have to pony up and buy more accounts. Get
out your credit card, and then follow these steps to sign up (and pay) for more Premier Edition user accounts:
In Control Panel, click "User Accounts"
"Buy more accounts". Or, if you're on the Dashboard, just click
the "Buy more accounts" link.
1.
The "Add User Accounts for Google Apps Premier Edition" page, shown in Figure 10-45, opens. This page
is an order form where you tell Google how many accounts you want to buy.
2.
In the Quantity box, type the number of user accounts you want to buy. If you're paying in a currency
other than U.S. dollars, select the currency from the drop-down list (at this writing, Google accepts half a
dozen European currencies). Click "Recalculate Total" to see the damage, and then click the "Proceed to
Google Checkout" button.
3.
A Google Checkout page opens, summarizing your order and showing its total. If you've already used
Google Checkout, then your payment info appears here. If this is your first time using Google Checkout,
give Google your payment information. When you're all set, click "Place your order now".
4.
Figure 10-45. Here's how you add more accounts to Premier Edition. Google uses Google Checkout to

process credit card payments. If you need to pay a different way, click the "contact us" link (circled)
to set up a different payment method.
Google receives your order and starts processing it. Be patient—it may take a while for Google to process the
payment and add the new accounts.
Don't try to share one account among several users: If Google notices a bunch of
different people accessing a single email account from different locations, it'll
temporarily lock everyone out of that account.
 

 
10.5. Getting Started with Email
As soon as your Google Apps sign-up is complete, Google automatically activates all your apps—except Email.
To get email working in your domain, you need to activate it manually.
NOTE
If you bought a domain name as part of the Google Apps sign-up process ([click here])—lucky you!
Google already took care of activating your email. Take a coffee break to enjoy the time you've saved, or
skip to [click here] to learn about the next slightly headache-inducing topic: domain aliases.
If you're still reading, here's the scoop: You have to set Mail Exchange (MX) records at the site that hosts your
domain (Network Solutions, for example) to work with Gmail. If that sentence makes your head spin, read on
for some clarifying details.
NOTE
Gmail (Chapter 5) is an email service anyone can sign up for. Google Apps Email, on the other hand, is
only for people in your Google Apps domain. To the people in your domain, Google Apps Email looks,
feels, and acts exactly like Gmail, but it offers you, the administrator, centralized management of
everyone's account ([click here] spells out the differences between Gmail and Google Apps Email).
MX records tell your mail servers where to send your incoming email. Before you can get email in your Google
Apps Email accounts, you need to change those records so the host forwards incoming messages to Google
Apps. For example, say Network Solutions hosts your domain, myvastdomain.com. You need to tell Network
Solutions what to do with email sent to that domain, so when an email for me@myvastdomain.com arrives,
Network Solutions knows to send it to your Google Apps Email account.
To get started changing your MX records and activating email in Google Apps, open the Dashboard and, in the
Service Settings section, find Email. Click the "Activate email" link. Google opens the "Set up Email Delivery"
page, shown in Figure 10-46.
Figure 10-46. This page tells you how to change MX records. To get instructions specific to your
domain host, click the drop-down list (circled), and then look for your host. Here, Google lists the
steps for changing MX records in the popular host Network Solutions. If you don't see your domain
host in the drop-down list, then select "Any hosting company" to get a general overview of how to
change MX records.

If your domain already has email addresses, be very, very careful when you're changing
the domain's MX records. Before you change your MX records, use the Google Apps
Control Panel to create an identical set of user accounts ([click here]). Otherwise, you
may have to deal with a disruption in email service.
How you change MX records depends on your domain host, so there's no one set of steps that works for
everyone. Google tries to make things easier by pulling together instructions for some popular domain hosts. On
the Setup Email Delivery page, look in the "Showing instructions for" drop-down list for your domain host. If it's
there, select it, and Google guides you, step by step, through the process of changing MX records for that host.
If your domain host isn't on the list, don't panic. Select "Any hosting company" for an overview of the process
that you can apply to your own situation.
In general, here's how you change MX records:
Go to the site that hosts your domain, and then sign in.
1.
Find the page where you manage MX records. This page is probably in a section with a name like DNS
2.

Management, Mail Server Configuration, or Name Server Management. You might have to poke around to
find it. Often, the spot for managing MX records is tucked inside an Advanced Settings page for managing
or editing DNS. If you really can't find a page that lets you edit MX records, then contact your domain
host's tech support.
When you find the page for managing MX records, delete any existing MX records you find there. Then,
enter MX values from Table 10-1, which shows MX Server addresses in descending priority. Start at the
top and work down—the first address, ASPMX.L.GOOGLE.COM., is the highest priority. If your host
domain's MX records management page doesn't have slots for seven addresses, start with
ASPMX.L.GOOGLE.COM., then put ALT1.ASPMX.L.GOOGLE.COM. into the next slot, and so on, until you've
filled up the available slots.
NOTE
You may have to include the period at the end of the MX server address. If you were reading the
address out loud, it would sound like this: "ASPMX dot L dot GOOGLE dot COM period."
Table 10-1. MX Server Addresses for Google Apps Email
MX Server Address
Priority
ASPMX.L.GOOGLE.COM.
10
ALT1.ASPMX.L.GOOGLE.COM.
20
ALT2.ASPMX.L.GOOGLE.COM.
20
ASPMX2.GOOGLEMAIL.COM.
30
ASPMX3.GOOGLEMAIL.COM.
30
ASPMX4.GOOGLEMAIL.COM.
30
ASPMX5.GOOGLEMAIL.COM.
30
NOTE
The priority numbers your domain host uses may differ from those in Table 10-1. Instead of 10-
20-30, for example, the ranking may be 1-3-5 or 1-5-10. Work with your domain host's system.
The important thing is to maintain the priority ranking, rather than a specific number.
3.
Click OK or Save or whatever button lets you save the new MX records. It may take a while, even several
hours, for your domain host to update these records. Its Domain Management page should show the
status of the update, and change to Ready (or something similar) when the update is complete.
4.

After your MX records have updated, you're all set to go back over to the "Set up Email Delivery" page (Figure
10-46). Scroll down to the bottom of the page, and then click "I have completed these steps." Google verifies
the changes with your domain host, and then activates your Google Apps Email.
If you're still waiting for your domain host to update the changes you made to your domain's MX records, then
click "I will do this later." After the host has updated your domain, come back to the "Set up Email Delivery"
page by clicking the Dashboard's "Activate email" link.
10.5.1. Migrating Email into Google Apps (Premier and Education Editions Only)
Businesses and organizations that use Google Apps Premier or Education edition can bring existing email over
from their current mail servers and stash it in users' new Google Apps Email accounts. When you migrate
existing accounts to Google Apps, the email keeps its original sent/received timestamp and read/unread status,
so you don't have to comb through a bunch of falsely labeled "unread" emails looking for that message from a
client you know you read a couple of weeks ago.
After the migration, Google works its magic on the messages in the new Google Apps Email accounts, changing
folders into Gmail-style labels ([click here]) and organizing emails into threaded conversations ([click here]).
And of course, you can search all the migrated emails using Google's awesome search capability.
10.5.1.1. Getting ready
First, make sure that your current mail server will cooperate with a migration. These servers should work just
fine:
Microsoft Exchange Server 2003 (If your organization uses MAPI on Exchange Server 2003, you may
need to turn on IMAP access.)
Cyrus IMAP Server
Courier-IMAP
Dovecot
NOTE
If you use another server—including Microsoft Exchange 2007, Lotus Domino, and UW—you can try to
migrate email, but Google doesn't support those servers. So if you run into a problem, you're on your
own—Google won't help you.
Gather up all the user names and passwords for the current mail server; Google needs them to transfer the
mail. Google also needs to get through your organization's firewall (a protective electronic barrier around your

company's computer systems), so make sure that the firewall is open for access to your mail server.
Specifically, Google needs access to these IP addresses ([click here]):
216.239.56.0/23
64.233.160.0/19
66.249.80.0/20
72.14.192.0/18
209.85.128.0/17
66.102.0.0/20
Google doesn't transfer any messages that are over 20 MB in size, including attachments. So make sure that
people back up any files that may not transfer.
Before you migrate email into Google Apps, create accounts ([click here]) for everyone whose email will be
making the trip. (If you don't, Google won't know where to put the emails!) Once the user accounts are in place,
you can move your email over to Google in three simple steps.
Before you migrate everybody's email, try out a few test accounts first to make sure
everything's working the way it should.
10.5.1.2. Step 1: Set server connection
First, you need to tell Google how to connect with your mail server. In the Google Apps Control Panel, select
"Advanced tools"
"Set up email (IMAP) migration". Google opens Step 1 of the "Migrate Mail from Mail
Server" page, shown in Figure 10-47.
Figure 10-47. To start the process of moving old email into Google Apps, let Google know where to
find the old mail.

Fill out the form so Google knows how to connect to the server that currently holds your organization's email. If
you want, you can tell Google to leave certain folders out of the migration. You can also specify the maximum
number of connections to the server, and a blackout time to pause the migration during busy hours at the office
(like Monday morning when everyone checks email).
When you've filled out the form, click Continue.
10.5.1.3. Step 2: Add user accounts
Google opens the "Specify users to migrate" page, where you tell Google which users you want to migrate. Turn
on one of these two radio buttons:
Specify a few user accounts. When you choose this option, Google asks for each person's Google user
name, source user name (the user name on the server emails are migrating from), and the source
password (the password for the old email account).
Specify many user accounts via file upload. You can upload thousands of user accounts at a time
using a CSV file ([click here]). Make sure the file contains these fields for each account:
Google Apps Email address

Source user name
Source password
Click Continue to move on to the final step.
10.5.1.4. Step 3: Start migration
You've told Google what to get and where to get it. Now Google shows you the details of the transfer:
How many accounts.
The connection settings.
Any blackout times you've specified.
If these details look good, click "Start transfer", and the emails starts their migration.
10.5.1.5. How long will it take?
Google's fast, but a big migration of a lot of accounts takes time. Figure on 50 email accounts per connection
every 12 to 24 hours.
NOTE
At this writing, Google doesn't offer tech support by phone for email migration, even to Premier and
Education Edition admins.
 

 
10.6. Adding Domain Aliases
Have you ever noticed that, if you type www.goolge.com (note the misplaced g) into your browser's address
bar, you still end up on the Google Web site? (Go ahead, try it.) That's because Google has reserved that
misspelling of its name as a domain alias. Similarly, when you type www.igoogle.com into the address bar, you
end up at www.google.com/ig, the address of the actual iGoogle site, for the same reason. Google, like many
online companies, uses domain aliases to make sure you land on the right page.
A domain alias is simply a domain name that points to another domain. This means you (and other users) can
get to the same site via different addresses. Domain aliasing is a great way to manage correspondence for a
bunch of different sites. Say, for example, that you own several Web sites on various topics:
www.savethewallabies.org, www.myfavoritekites.com, and www.kazoosymphony.net. You want to be able to
send and receive email with an address that's specific to each site, but you don't want to have to sign into three
different mailboxes to check your email. By making these domains aliases that point to your Google Apps
domain, you can make sure any email that gets sent to you at @savethewallabies.org, @myfavoritekites.com,
or @kazoosymphony.net lands in your Google Apps Email inbox.
To send email using a domain alias, read about how to use a custom from address
([click here]).
Before you add a domain alias, you need to own the domain. So register any domains you want to add. (You
can't use a domain that's already registered with Google Apps as an alias for another domain.)
Adding a domain alias involves two phases: telling Google the domain name you want to add as an alias and
setting up email so it's delivered from the domain alias to your primary domain. Here are the steps for the first
phase:
From the Control Panel, click "Domain settings"
"Domain names". (If you're on the Dashboard, then
just click the "domain names" link.)
The Domain Names tab lists your primary domain and any domain aliases.
1.
Click "Add a domain alias".
The "Add a Domain Alias" page, shown in Figure 10-48, opens.
2.
In the text box, type the domain you want to add as an alias, and then click "Continue and set up email
delivery".
Google opens the "Set up Email Delivery" page, shown back in Figure 10-46.
3.
Figure 10-48. Here's where you can link another domain name that you own to your primary Google

Apps domain.
That's all there is to phase one. Phase two, setting up email delivery for your domain alias, is identical to setting
it up for your primary domain. So flip back to [click here] and walk through those steps.
 

 
10.7. Getting Support
When you've got a question, you want an answer—now if not sooner. Google offers several different ways to
find help. Premier and Education Edition admins get a phone number they can call for live support (make sure
you have your customer ID number and PIN handy when you call—to find these, along with the number to call,
go to Control Panel and click "Domain settings"
"Account information" and look in the "Admin support"
section).
Google offers live phone support from Sunday evening at 5:00 p.m. Pacific Standard Time until Friday evening
at 5:00 p.m. PST. Phone support is for what Google calls "system critical issues." That means that if you can't
get into your Google Apps account, you can't get a service activated, or one of your Google apps has suddenly
quit working, Google takes your call. If you've got an emergency so that more than half of your people can't use
email or Google Calendar, you can get through even on weekends. Otherwise, if you call during off hours, then
you can leave a message and wait for Google to call you back.
Don't share your administrator PIN with anyone besides other administrators and
Google support staff. Anyone who knows your PIN can makes changes to your Google
Apps account. That's why Google changes your PIN from time to time. Before you
contact support, make sure you've got the current PIN in hand.
If you want to contact Google with questions about billing, email migration, canceling or upgrading your
account—in short, about anything that doesn't interfere with the right-now performance of Google Apps—you
have to email Google. Standard Edition admins can get support only via email. To send an email, go to
http://google.com/support/a/bin/request.py, shown in Figure 10-49, and fill out the form. (Another route to the
Administrator Contact page is Help
"How do I contact the support team?"
"Classify your issue". Premier
and Education Edition administrators can also get there from the Control Panel by clicking "Domain settings"
"Account information"
"Contact us online"
"If your issue isn't covered above, report it via email.")
Figure 10-49. Before you email Google for support, choose the category that best describes your
problem.

Besides contacting Google directly, Google Apps administrators have these help resources:
Google Apps Help for Administrators. Administrators have to worry about all kinds of things of which
the people in their domain remain blissfully ignorant. When you're signed into your admin account and you
run into a problem, click the upper-right Help link to open a Help page that's specially designed for
administrators.
To go straight to the Help for Administrators page, point your browser to
http://www.google.com/support/a.
Google Apps Help for End Users. If you need to help someone solve a problem with a Google program,
it's helpful to know about this page, which focuses on using Google Apps, rather than managing them.
From the Administrator Help page, click the left-hand "Help Center for Users" link, or go straight to this
URL: www.google.com/support/a/users.
Google Apps Discussion Group. Often, the very best help and suggestions come from your peers,
people who've been in the same boat and figured out how to make it to shore. The Apps Discussion
Group, shown in Figure 10-50, lives at http://groups.google.com/group/apps-discuss. (You can also get
there from the Administrators Help page by clicking the right-hand Google Apps Discussion Group link.)
When you first arrive at the discussion group, you have to join if you want to post. Click the right-hand
"Join this group" link, and then take a few seconds to sign up. Once you do, you've got more than 20,000
Google Apps users eager to converse with you. Click the upper-right Discussions link to search the forums,
read discussions, or post a question.

Figure 10-50. The Google Apps Discussion Group never tires of talking about all things Google
Apps. To see the forums with the threaded conversations, click Discussions (circled right).
Before you ask a question, do a search (at the top of the page) to see if it's already been asked
and answered. If not, make sure you've signed up, and then choose the relevant forum and
click its "post your question" button (also circled).
 

 
Chapter 11. Administering Google Apps
The last chapter taught you how to set up your Google Apps domain. But life as an administrator/Grand Pooh
Bah typically involves far more than simply setting up and launching your Google Apps. As domain chief, it's up
to you to make sure your digital empire runs smoothly. Google takes care of all the hard stuff, like keeping the
servers up and running, so you can focus on making sure your Google Apps domain fits the working style of the
people in your organization. This chapter covers domain-level administrative tasks like managing users, apps,
and domain settings. If only managing people were this easy.
11.1. Managing Users
When you manage people, you've always got day-to-day tasks to keep up with: resetting forgotten passwords,
keeping an eye on email quotas, even blocking troublesome users from signing in. Google Apps makes it easy to
do all these things; the place to start is the User Accounts page, shown in Figure 11-1. (To get there, go to
Control Panel, and then click "User accounts".)
Figure 11-1. The User Accounts page' Users tab lists the people in your Google Apps domain, their
status, the last time they signed in, and how much email they're using. You can sort by any column;
just click a column's name to reorder the list.
The User Accounts page's list gives you an overview of the people in your domain:
Name. Each person's registered name.
Username. The ID you created for each user when you set up their accounts.

Status. If this column is blank, it means the person is a regular ol' user—with no problems and no special
status. Here's the info that can appear in this column:
Newly created. This means you recently created the account and the person hasn't yet signed in.
Administrator. This person can sign into your Google Apps Control Panel, and manage the domain;
[click here] clues you in on how to grant someone Administrator status.
Suspended. You've blocked this person from signing into his account; he'll stay that way until you
unblock him. (See [click here] to learn how to suspend people.)
Abusive. Google, not you, determines this status. If one of your users violates Google's Terms of
Service (by using her email account to send out spam, for example), she gets slapped with the
Abusive label, and that's it for her—Google shuts down her account. You can delete abusive
accounts, but you can't reactivate them.
Email quota. This column helps you keep an eye on how full people's mailboxes are (see the box on [click
here] for details on the various edition's storage size limits).
Last signed in. Who's been slacking off? This column shows when each person last signed in.
To edit someone's account info, click the person's name to open a page like the one shown in Figure 11-2.
Figure 11-2. Each user account has an Edit page like this, where you can manage his account.

11.1.1. Editing Users
Chapter 10 showed you how to add users ([click here]) when you set up your domain. Once you've tapped the
chosen few, you can change their accounts in various ways. This section covers the day-to-day tasks of
managing folks in your domain.
11.1.1.1. Change a user's name
When somebody gets married or reports that her name is misspelled on her account, you can set things straight
in a jiffy. From the User Accounts page's the Users tab, click the name you want to change. The person's Edit
page opens (Figure 11-2). Click the "Change name" link just below her name. The user's name changes to text
boxes, so you can edit it. Make your changes, scroll down to the bottom of the page, and then click "Save
changes".
11.1.1.2. Reset a user's password
People forget their passwords all the time. It's up to you, Super Admin, to come to the rescue. No need to
change into your cape and tights; just go to the User Accounts page, find the hapless user, and then click his
name to open her Edit page (Figure 11-2).
In the Password section, click the "Change password" link. Two text boxes appear so you can enter and re-enter

a new password. (Google evaluates the password's strength as you type it.) Be sure to write down the new
password so you can tell the user what it is!
It's a good idea to turn on the "Require a change of password in the next sign in" checkbox when you reset
someone's password. That way, when he signs in with the new password you just created, he has to come up
with a new password to complete the sign-in process. (With any luck, it'll be one he'll actually remember.)
After you've reset the password, at the bottom of the page, click "Save changes". Then tell the person his new
password, so he can sign in and get back to work.
11.1.1.3. Give a user administrative privileges
With Google Apps, you don't have to shoulder the burden of managing your domain all by yourself. You can
grant administrative privileges to anyone in your domain. Those lucky souls can then do everything you can:
Sign into the Control Panel, create new users, adjust settings and customize apps, grant administrative
privileges to others—even reset your password and remove you as an administrator or suspend your account.
Needless to say, don't hand out administrator privileges lightly.
To make someone an admin, in the Control Panel, click "User accounts", and then click the person's name in the
list of users to open her Edit page (Figure 11-2). In the Privileges section, turn on the checkbox that's labeled
something like Allow Nicole to administer myvastdomain.com. Google opens a confirmation box asking whether
you really want to bestow the godlike powers of an administrator upon this person. Click OK, and then at the
bottom of the page, click "Save changes".
After you've given someone administrative privileges, the next time she signs in, she'll sees a page asking her
to create an administrator account. This page asks her to pick a default language, enter a word verification (to
make sure she's a real person), and agree to Google's admin-level Terms of Service. Once she's done all that,
you've got company in Administrator Land.
On the User Accounts page's Users list (Figure 11-1), she'll now have the word Administrator in the Status
column by her name. To revoke her Administrator status, click her name. On the page that opens, go to the
Privileges section, and then turn off the checkbox. Click "Save changes", and she's back to mere mortal status
within your domain.
NOTE
A person can decline administrator status (not everyone can handle that kind of power) by selecting "I
decline to be an administrator" the next time she signs in to her account. In that case, she'll just remain
a regular user in your domain.
11.1.1.4. Give a user a nickname
The purpose of giving a user a nickname isn't so you can amuse yourself by calling someone Sparky or
Picklehead behind his back. Instead, nicknames are a powerful feature that let you add alternate email
addresses to your domain without having to add new accounts.

For example, say Daniel is in charge of customer service. If you set up the nickname customercare for his
account, emails sent to customercare@yourdomain.com go to Daniel's inbox. He can then filter ([click here])
and label ([click here]) mail sent to that nickname to distinguish it from his other email.
To create a nickname, start on the Control Panel's User Accounts page (Figure 11-1), and click the person's
name to open his Edit page (Figure 11-2). Scroll down to the Nicknames section, and then click the "Add a
nickname" link. The section expands, so you can enter a nickname and create a secondary email address for
him. Type the nickname in the text box, and then click "Save changes" to create it.
Now, when someone sends an email to the nickname (using an address in the format
nickname@yourdomain.com), that message goes to the person with the nickname.
NOTE
Google reserves the nicknames postmaster and abuse for itself, so it can monitor problems others report
about your domain. That means you can't use either of these nicknames within your domain. But you can
get a copy of any emails sent to postmaster@yourdomain.com or abuse@yourdomain.com by using
email lists ([click here]).
11.1.1.5. View users' email addresses
To see a list of all the email addresses in your domain, start on the Control Panel, and click "Service settings"
Email
"Email addresses". (Or, for a shorter route, click "User accounts", and then click the "Email
addresses" link.) This opens a page like the one shown in Figure 11-3, listing all the email addresses for your
domain, including nicknames and email lists ([click here]). You can sort the list by any of its column headings:
email address, type of account, or recipients' names (this last one's helpful when people forget their user
names). Make a selection from the drop-down list to show only one type of email address: user accounts,
nicknames, or email lists.
Figure 11-3. The Email Settings page's Email Addresses tab (circled) shows the email addresses in
your domain. You can sort the list by clicking a column heading, or use the drop-down list (also
circled) to display just one kind of account.

11.1.1.6. Export users' email addresses
Occasionally, you might find you want to work with your domain's users account info in a spreadsheet program
rather than in Apps. This is handy when you need to do an across-the-board change of user names or
passwords, for example. In cases like that, you can download user info in CSV (comma-separated values)
format so you can open the file in Docs or Excel, for instance.
To export a list of all your users and their email addresses, start at the Control Panel, and select "Service
settings"
Email
"Email addresses". This takes you to the Email Settings page's Email Addresses tab
(Figure 11-3). Scroll to the bottom of the page, and then click the "Download user list as CSV" link. Your
browser asks whether you want to save the file to your computer or open it in your spreadsheet program; take
your pick.
If you want to open the CSV file in Docs, save it to your computer, and then import it
([click here]) into Docs.
The spreadsheet file includes this info for everyone in your domain:
User name (the parts of their email addresses that come before the @ symbol)

First and last names
Most recent sign-in date
Original sign-in date
Email quota (this shows how much of their email quotas they've used, as a percentage)
Once you've imported the file into a spreadsheet program, you can work with it like any other spreadsheet.
If you downloaded the user info to change everyone's user names or passwords, delete
the LastLogin, FirstLogin, and Quota columns, and then add a column titled password
and fill in new passwords. That way, when you upload the file back into Apps to bulk
update user accounts ([click here]), the column headers will match the ones Google
expects: username, first name, last name, and password.
11.1.1.7. Re-invite a user
If you've created an account ([click here]) for someone and you notice she hasn't yet signed into your domain
([click here]), then you can easily reissue the invitation. On the User Accounts page's Users list (Figure 11-1),
find and click the AWOL person's name. As Figure 11-4 shows, the Edit page displays info about the not-yet-
used account. Click the "Email instructions" link to send another invitation email (it's customizable, so you can
remind her of all the stuff she's missing out on.)
Figure 11-4. To make sure a new user can sign in, click the "Print instructions" or "Email
instructions" link (both circled) to give that person his account info.

If you prefer, you can print out the new account sign-in instructions and hand them to the person so you're sure
she gets her account info, and understands how to sign in.
11.1.1.8. Turn on contact sharing
Contact sharing ensures that everyone in your domain can easily get in touch with everyone else by creating a
shared address book. So when somebody wants to send an email, share a document, or chat with someone else
in the domain, the person's address is right at his fingertips. And as you add new people to your domain, Google
automatically adds them to the shared address book.
Sharing contacts creates a domain directory that everyone in the domain can access. This directory is similar to
a Gmail Contacts list ([click here]). When you write an email in Google Apps Email, just start typing a name in
the To: line, and Google uses your Contacts list to guess whom you're writing to, saving you some typing.
(When you share contacts, your personal contacts don't get shared, so you're not giving your sister's or your
accountant's email address to everyone in your domain. Only contacts whose email addresses end in
@yourdomain.com become part of the directory.)
To create a domain-wide contact directory for everyone to share, go to the Control Panel, and then click "User
accounts"
Settings. This gets you to the page shown in Figure 11-5.
Figure 11-5. Creating an internal directory for your domain is as easy as turning on the "Enable

contact sharing" radio button, and then clicking "Save changes".
Turn on the "Enable contact sharing" radio button, and then click "Save changes". Google creates a Contacts list
for your domain, and then gives it to everyone in your domain (it automatically becomes part of their email
application). If you have a big domain, it may take Google several minutes to set up contact sharing, so have
some patience—it's worth the wait.
11.1.1.9. Turn off contact sharing
If you change your mind about contact sharing, you can easily turn it off. Just go to the Control Panel, select
"User accounts"
Settings, turn on the "Disable contact sharing" radio button, and then save your change.
Bear in mind, though, that disabling contact sharing doesn't affect existing users; they keep their Contacts lists.
But any new users you create don't get a domain-wide Contacts list and don't get added automatically to others'
Contacts lists.
11.1.1.10. Suspend a user
People do strange things. So when you manage people, you sometimes have to deal with problems. If you hear,
for example, that someone has turned her email account into Spam Central, is harassing other users in Chat, or
is trying to sabotage somebody else's work, you can suspend the troublemaker's account (blocking her access
to it) until you can straighten things out.
NOTE
Suspending someone means that person's account stops getting emails and calendar or document-
sharing invitations. So don't suspend somebody who's simply away on vacation—or he won't have any
work to do when he gets back.

To suspend someone, follow these steps:
In the Control Panel, click "User accounts", and then, on the page that appears, click the person's name.
The page for editing her account opens, as shown in Figure 11-2.
1.
Under her name, click the "Suspend user" link.
A box opens explaining the consequences of suspending someone, and asking if you want to proceed.
2.
Click the "Suspend user" button.
Google suspends the account, marking her as Suspended in the User list's Status column. Until you lift the
suspension, she can't sign into or use any of the Google apps in your domain.
3.
When someone you've suspended returns to your good graces, you can restore her account access. Click your
way back to the page shown in Figure 11-2. Beneath her name is a notice about her suspension. Click "Restore
user", and Google expands the section to get confirmation. Click the "Restore user" button to unlock her
account.
11.1.1.11. Delete a user
When you delete someone's account, he loses all access to the Google Apps in your domain. Google also gets
rid of all the data in his apps—and you can't save that info or get it back. If you're not sure whether you'll need
to restore someone's access later on, suspend the person's account instead. Save deletion for when somebody
leaves your organization.
Deleting someone's account is almost the same as suspending one: From the Control Panel, click "User
accounts", and then in the Users list, click his name. When the page in Figure 11-2 opens, look under his name,
and then click the "Delete user" link. Google displays a warning box. If you're sure you want to delete that
person and everything in his apps, click "Delete user", and Google permanently removes him from your domain.
To delete several accounts at once, click "User accounts", and then turn on the checkboxes of the accounts you
want to delete. Then click "Delete users", and Google shows you a similar warning box to the one you see when
you delete a single account. Click "Delete users and emails", and Google removes the accounts you chose.
NOTE
After you've deleted someone, you have to wait 5 days before you can create another account with the
same user name you just deleted.
11.1.2. Monitoring Users

To keep things running smoothly, you want to keep an eye on your users: when they last signed in and how
much of their email storage they've used. That way, you can avoid paying for folks who never use their
accounts, and you won't suddenly discover that someone's run out of room for her email.
11.1.2.1. View sign-in stats
If you pay for Google Apps Premier Edition, you probably don't want to shell out $50 a year for people who
hardly use their accounts. Even if you use one of the free editions, you may not want a lot of deadwood lying
around. From the Control Panel, you can find out how active your users are.
To see everyone's most recent sign-in, just click "User accounts", and then look in the Users list's far-right "Last
signed in" column (Figure 11-1). If the most recent sign-in was today, the column shows the actual sign-in time.
For older sign-ins, the column just shows the date. If someone has never signed in, Google tells you that, too,
so you can resend that person's invitation ([click here]). Click the column's name to sort the list in descending
(oldest first) or ascending (most recent first) order.
11.1.2.2. See email usage
Google Apps gives you tons of email storage space. Even in the free Standard and Education editions, each
person gets a roomy 6-plus GB mailbox. Premier Edition accounts get more than quadruple that amount: 25 GB
per user. For garden-variety emails, that's probably more than your users need. But file attachments—especially
video and MP3 files—can take up a lot of room, so those mailboxes can fill up quicker than you'd expect.
To see how much email storage people are using, from the Control Panel, click "User accounts" and check out
the Users list's Email Quota column (Figure 11-1), which shows what percentage of each user's mailbox is full.
You can also see a particular person's email usage on the page where you edit his account info (Figure 11-2).
When somebody's mailbox starts getting full, you might want to let him know that it's time to clean house and
make some room.
 

 
Chapter 11. Administering Google Apps
The last chapter taught you how to set up your Google Apps domain. But life as an administrator/Grand Pooh
Bah typically involves far more than simply setting up and launching your Google Apps. As domain chief, it's up
to you to make sure your digital empire runs smoothly. Google takes care of all the hard stuff, like keeping the
servers up and running, so you can focus on making sure your Google Apps domain fits the working style of the
people in your organization. This chapter covers domain-level administrative tasks like managing users, apps,
and domain settings. If only managing people were this easy.
11.1. Managing Users
When you manage people, you've always got day-to-day tasks to keep up with: resetting forgotten passwords,
keeping an eye on email quotas, even blocking troublesome users from signing in. Google Apps makes it easy to
do all these things; the place to start is the User Accounts page, shown in Figure 11-1. (To get there, go to
Control Panel, and then click "User accounts".)
Figure 11-1. The User Accounts page' Users tab lists the people in your Google Apps domain, their
status, the last time they signed in, and how much email they're using. You can sort by any column;
just click a column's name to reorder the list.
The User Accounts page's list gives you an overview of the people in your domain:
Name. Each person's registered name.
Username. The ID you created for each user when you set up their accounts.

Status. If this column is blank, it means the person is a regular ol' user—with no problems and no special
status. Here's the info that can appear in this column:
Newly created. This means you recently created the account and the person hasn't yet signed in.
Administrator. This person can sign into your Google Apps Control Panel, and manage the domain;
[click here] clues you in on how to grant someone Administrator status.
Suspended. You've blocked this person from signing into his account; he'll stay that way until you
unblock him. (See [click here] to learn how to suspend people.)
Abusive. Google, not you, determines this status. If one of your users violates Google's Terms of
Service (by using her email account to send out spam, for example), she gets slapped with the
Abusive label, and that's it for her—Google shuts down her account. You can delete abusive
accounts, but you can't reactivate them.
Email quota. This column helps you keep an eye on how full people's mailboxes are (see the box on [click
here] for details on the various edition's storage size limits).
Last signed in. Who's been slacking off? This column shows when each person last signed in.
To edit someone's account info, click the person's name to open a page like the one shown in Figure 11-2.
Figure 11-2. Each user account has an Edit page like this, where you can manage his account.

11.1.1. Editing Users
Chapter 10 showed you how to add users ([click here]) when you set up your domain. Once you've tapped the
chosen few, you can change their accounts in various ways. This section covers the day-to-day tasks of
managing folks in your domain.
11.1.1.1. Change a user's name
When somebody gets married or reports that her name is misspelled on her account, you can set things straight
in a jiffy. From the User Accounts page's the Users tab, click the name you want to change. The person's Edit
page opens (Figure 11-2). Click the "Change name" link just below her name. The user's name changes to text
boxes, so you can edit it. Make your changes, scroll down to the bottom of the page, and then click "Save
changes".
11.1.1.2. Reset a user's password
People forget their passwords all the time. It's up to you, Super Admin, to come to the rescue. No need to
change into your cape and tights; just go to the User Accounts page, find the hapless user, and then click his
name to open her Edit page (Figure 11-2).
In the Password section, click the "Change password" link. Two text boxes appear so you can enter and re-enter

a new password. (Google evaluates the password's strength as you type it.) Be sure to write down the new
password so you can tell the user what it is!
It's a good idea to turn on the "Require a change of password in the next sign in" checkbox when you reset
someone's password. That way, when he signs in with the new password you just created, he has to come up
with a new password to complete the sign-in process. (With any luck, it'll be one he'll actually remember.)
After you've reset the password, at the bottom of the page, click "Save changes". Then tell the person his new
password, so he can sign in and get back to work.
11.1.1.3. Give a user administrative privileges
With Google Apps, you don't have to shoulder the burden of managing your domain all by yourself. You can
grant administrative privileges to anyone in your domain. Those lucky souls can then do everything you can:
Sign into the Control Panel, create new users, adjust settings and customize apps, grant administrative
privileges to others—even reset your password and remove you as an administrator or suspend your account.
Needless to say, don't hand out administrator privileges lightly.
To make someone an admin, in the Control Panel, click "User accounts", and then click the person's name in the
list of users to open her Edit page (Figure 11-2). In the Privileges section, turn on the checkbox that's labeled
something like Allow Nicole to administer myvastdomain.com. Google opens a confirmation box asking whether
you really want to bestow the godlike powers of an administrator upon this person. Click OK, and then at the
bottom of the page, click "Save changes".
After you've given someone administrative privileges, the next time she signs in, she'll sees a page asking her
to create an administrator account. This page asks her to pick a default language, enter a word verification (to
make sure she's a real person), and agree to Google's admin-level Terms of Service. Once she's done all that,
you've got company in Administrator Land.
On the User Accounts page's Users list (Figure 11-1), she'll now have the word Administrator in the Status
column by her name. To revoke her Administrator status, click her name. On the page that opens, go to the
Privileges section, and then turn off the checkbox. Click "Save changes", and she's back to mere mortal status
within your domain.
NOTE
A person can decline administrator status (not everyone can handle that kind of power) by selecting "I
decline to be an administrator" the next time she signs in to her account. In that case, she'll just remain
a regular user in your domain.
11.1.1.4. Give a user a nickname
The purpose of giving a user a nickname isn't so you can amuse yourself by calling someone Sparky or
Picklehead behind his back. Instead, nicknames are a powerful feature that let you add alternate email
addresses to your domain without having to add new accounts.

For example, say Daniel is in charge of customer service. If you set up the nickname customercare for his
account, emails sent to customercare@yourdomain.com go to Daniel's inbox. He can then filter ([click here])
and label ([click here]) mail sent to that nickname to distinguish it from his other email.
To create a nickname, start on the Control Panel's User Accounts page (Figure 11-1), and click the person's
name to open his Edit page (Figure 11-2). Scroll down to the Nicknames section, and then click the "Add a
nickname" link. The section expands, so you can enter a nickname and create a secondary email address for
him. Type the nickname in the text box, and then click "Save changes" to create it.
Now, when someone sends an email to the nickname (using an address in the format
nickname@yourdomain.com), that message goes to the person with the nickname.
NOTE
Google reserves the nicknames postmaster and abuse for itself, so it can monitor problems others report
about your domain. That means you can't use either of these nicknames within your domain. But you can
get a copy of any emails sent to postmaster@yourdomain.com or abuse@yourdomain.com by using
email lists ([click here]).
11.1.1.5. View users' email addresses
To see a list of all the email addresses in your domain, start on the Control Panel, and click "Service settings"
Email
"Email addresses". (Or, for a shorter route, click "User accounts", and then click the "Email
addresses" link.) This opens a page like the one shown in Figure 11-3, listing all the email addresses for your
domain, including nicknames and email lists ([click here]). You can sort the list by any of its column headings:
email address, type of account, or recipients' names (this last one's helpful when people forget their user
names). Make a selection from the drop-down list to show only one type of email address: user accounts,
nicknames, or email lists.
Figure 11-3. The Email Settings page's Email Addresses tab (circled) shows the email addresses in
your domain. You can sort the list by clicking a column heading, or use the drop-down list (also
circled) to display just one kind of account.

11.1.1.6. Export users' email addresses
Occasionally, you might find you want to work with your domain's users account info in a spreadsheet program
rather than in Apps. This is handy when you need to do an across-the-board change of user names or
passwords, for example. In cases like that, you can download user info in CSV (comma-separated values)
format so you can open the file in Docs or Excel, for instance.
To export a list of all your users and their email addresses, start at the Control Panel, and select "Service
settings"
Email
"Email addresses". This takes you to the Email Settings page's Email Addresses tab
(Figure 11-3). Scroll to the bottom of the page, and then click the "Download user list as CSV" link. Your
browser asks whether you want to save the file to your computer or open it in your spreadsheet program; take
your pick.
If you want to open the CSV file in Docs, save it to your computer, and then import it
([click here]) into Docs.
The spreadsheet file includes this info for everyone in your domain:
User name (the parts of their email addresses that come before the @ symbol)

First and last names
Most recent sign-in date
Original sign-in date
Email quota (this shows how much of their email quotas they've used, as a percentage)
Once you've imported the file into a spreadsheet program, you can work with it like any other spreadsheet.
If you downloaded the user info to change everyone's user names or passwords, delete
the LastLogin, FirstLogin, and Quota columns, and then add a column titled password
and fill in new passwords. That way, when you upload the file back into Apps to bulk
update user accounts ([click here]), the column headers will match the ones Google
expects: username, first name, last name, and password.
11.1.1.7. Re-invite a user
If you've created an account ([click here]) for someone and you notice she hasn't yet signed into your domain
([click here]), then you can easily reissue the invitation. On the User Accounts page's Users list (Figure 11-1),
find and click the AWOL person's name. As Figure 11-4 shows, the Edit page displays info about the not-yet-
used account. Click the "Email instructions" link to send another invitation email (it's customizable, so you can
remind her of all the stuff she's missing out on.)
Figure 11-4. To make sure a new user can sign in, click the "Print instructions" or "Email
instructions" link (both circled) to give that person his account info.

If you prefer, you can print out the new account sign-in instructions and hand them to the person so you're sure
she gets her account info, and understands how to sign in.
11.1.1.8. Turn on contact sharing
Contact sharing ensures that everyone in your domain can easily get in touch with everyone else by creating a
shared address book. So when somebody wants to send an email, share a document, or chat with someone else
in the domain, the person's address is right at his fingertips. And as you add new people to your domain, Google
automatically adds them to the shared address book.
Sharing contacts creates a domain directory that everyone in the domain can access. This directory is similar to
a Gmail Contacts list ([click here]). When you write an email in Google Apps Email, just start typing a name in
the To: line, and Google uses your Contacts list to guess whom you're writing to, saving you some typing.
(When you share contacts, your personal contacts don't get shared, so you're not giving your sister's or your
accountant's email address to everyone in your domain. Only contacts whose email addresses end in
@yourdomain.com become part of the directory.)
To create a domain-wide contact directory for everyone to share, go to the Control Panel, and then click "User
accounts"
Settings. This gets you to the page shown in Figure 11-5.
Figure 11-5. Creating an internal directory for your domain is as easy as turning on the "Enable

contact sharing" radio button, and then clicking "Save changes".
Turn on the "Enable contact sharing" radio button, and then click "Save changes". Google creates a Contacts list
for your domain, and then gives it to everyone in your domain (it automatically becomes part of their email
application). If you have a big domain, it may take Google several minutes to set up contact sharing, so have
some patience—it's worth the wait.
11.1.1.9. Turn off contact sharing
If you change your mind about contact sharing, you can easily turn it off. Just go to the Control Panel, select
"User accounts"
Settings, turn on the "Disable contact sharing" radio button, and then save your change.
Bear in mind, though, that disabling contact sharing doesn't affect existing users; they keep their Contacts lists.
But any new users you create don't get a domain-wide Contacts list and don't get added automatically to others'
Contacts lists.
11.1.1.10. Suspend a user
People do strange things. So when you manage people, you sometimes have to deal with problems. If you hear,
for example, that someone has turned her email account into Spam Central, is harassing other users in Chat, or
is trying to sabotage somebody else's work, you can suspend the troublemaker's account (blocking her access
to it) until you can straighten things out.
NOTE
Suspending someone means that person's account stops getting emails and calendar or document-
sharing invitations. So don't suspend somebody who's simply away on vacation—or he won't have any
work to do when he gets back.

To suspend someone, follow these steps:
In the Control Panel, click "User accounts", and then, on the page that appears, click the person's name.
The page for editing her account opens, as shown in Figure 11-2.
1.
Under her name, click the "Suspend user" link.
A box opens explaining the consequences of suspending someone, and asking if you want to proceed.
2.
Click the "Suspend user" button.
Google suspends the account, marking her as Suspended in the User list's Status column. Until you lift the
suspension, she can't sign into or use any of the Google apps in your domain.
3.
When someone you've suspended returns to your good graces, you can restore her account access. Click your
way back to the page shown in Figure 11-2. Beneath her name is a notice about her suspension. Click "Restore
user", and Google expands the section to get confirmation. Click the "Restore user" button to unlock her
account.
11.1.1.11. Delete a user
When you delete someone's account, he loses all access to the Google Apps in your domain. Google also gets
rid of all the data in his apps—and you can't save that info or get it back. If you're not sure whether you'll need
to restore someone's access later on, suspend the person's account instead. Save deletion for when somebody
leaves your organization.
Deleting someone's account is almost the same as suspending one: From the Control Panel, click "User
accounts", and then in the Users list, click his name. When the page in Figure 11-2 opens, look under his name,
and then click the "Delete user" link. Google displays a warning box. If you're sure you want to delete that
person and everything in his apps, click "Delete user", and Google permanently removes him from your domain.
To delete several accounts at once, click "User accounts", and then turn on the checkboxes of the accounts you
want to delete. Then click "Delete users", and Google shows you a similar warning box to the one you see when
you delete a single account. Click "Delete users and emails", and Google removes the accounts you chose.
NOTE
After you've deleted someone, you have to wait 5 days before you can create another account with the
same user name you just deleted.
11.1.2. Monitoring Users

To keep things running smoothly, you want to keep an eye on your users: when they last signed in and how
much of their email storage they've used. That way, you can avoid paying for folks who never use their
accounts, and you won't suddenly discover that someone's run out of room for her email.
11.1.2.1. View sign-in stats
If you pay for Google Apps Premier Edition, you probably don't want to shell out $50 a year for people who
hardly use their accounts. Even if you use one of the free editions, you may not want a lot of deadwood lying
around. From the Control Panel, you can find out how active your users are.
To see everyone's most recent sign-in, just click "User accounts", and then look in the Users list's far-right "Last
signed in" column (Figure 11-1). If the most recent sign-in was today, the column shows the actual sign-in time.
For older sign-ins, the column just shows the date. If someone has never signed in, Google tells you that, too,
so you can resend that person's invitation ([click here]). Click the column's name to sort the list in descending
(oldest first) or ascending (most recent first) order.
11.1.2.2. See email usage
Google Apps gives you tons of email storage space. Even in the free Standard and Education editions, each
person gets a roomy 6-plus GB mailbox. Premier Edition accounts get more than quadruple that amount: 25 GB
per user. For garden-variety emails, that's probably more than your users need. But file attachments—especially
video and MP3 files—can take up a lot of room, so those mailboxes can fill up quicker than you'd expect.
To see how much email storage people are using, from the Control Panel, click "User accounts" and check out
the Users list's Email Quota column (Figure 11-1), which shows what percentage of each user's mailbox is full.
You can also see a particular person's email usage on the page where you edit his account info (Figure 11-2).
When somebody's mailbox starts getting full, you might want to let him know that it's time to clean house and
make some room.
 

 
11.2. Managing Apps
As you know, Google Apps offers all kinds of programs designed to bolster your organization's
productivity—that's why you signed up for Apps in the first place. This section helps you get the most out of the
individual applications by setting sharing options so your users can collaborate more effectively. You'll also learn
about some special features available only in Premier and Education editions.
To see and manage the settings for a particular Google offering, go to the Control Panel's Dashboard, and then
click the program's name. Or, from anywhere in the Control Panel, click Service Settings, and then choose a
name from the drop-down menu.
Just about all of Google's applications have these two sections on their Settings pages:
Web address. This tells you where this app lives on the Web. From here, you can customize an app's URL
([click here]).
Disable service. Flip to [click here] to learn about disabling an app, and what's at stake when you do.
NOTE
Chat (the Google Apps version of Google Talk) and Premier Edition's Policy Management and Message
Recovery (a souped-up email administrator's tool—see [click here]) don't have URLs on their Settings
pages.
11.2.1. Google Docs
Google Docs is so big and so useful that it takes three whole chapters—Chapter 2, Chapter 3, and Chapter 4—to
describe everything it can do. One of the things that makes Docs so popular is how it lets you share documents,
spreadsheets, and presentations so you can collaborate in real time.
As a Google Apps admin, you get to control whether people can share their Docs files with folks outside your
domain. In order to allow (or restrict) this kind of outside sharing, from the Control Panel, select "Service
settings"
Docs to open the Docs Settings page, shown in Figure 11-6.
Figure 11-6. To control whether people in your domain can share documents, spreadsheets, and
presentations with outsiders (people whose email addresses don't end with your domain name),
choose an option here.

The "Sharing options" section offers these options:
Users cannot share documents outside this domain. If your domain is top secret, turn on this radio
button so people in your domain can't share insider documents with outsiders. Optionally, you can turn on
the checkbox that lets your users receive documents from Docs accounts beyond your domain. (Either
way, of course, users can always receive email attachments; this setting just controls the documents
they're exposed to within Google Docs.)
Users can share documents outside this domain, but will receive a warning each time. Google
uses this setting unless you tell it otherwise. Leave this option turned on if you don't want to prevent
outside sharing altogether, but you do want users to stop and think before they share outside your
organization.
NOTE
In case you're wondering what kind of warning Google slaps onto sharing invitations, here's what it
says: "The following users are from outside your domain. Are you sure you would like to invite
them?" The person sending the invite has to click OK to continue. This kind of warning can help
make sure that, if someone's inviting a long list of collaborators, she doesn't accidentally invite
someone she shouldn't.

Users can share documents outside this domain (without any warning). Turning on this radio
button makes sharing free and easy—people can share any document with anyone, anywhere.
After you've made your selection, click "Save changes" to put your sharing policy into action.
11.2.2. Google Apps Email
To the people in your domain, Google Apps Email looks and acts just like Gmail—so why doesn't Google just call
it Gmail? Because there are a few differences between regular Gmail (the kind anyone can sign up for) and
Google Apps Email (the kind that belongs to your domain):
Google Apps Email uses your domain name, not gmail.com, in its addresses. This is good, because it links
users' email addresses to your organization, not to Google.
Gmail doesn't recognize periods in email addresses ([click here]); Google Apps Email does. So if Josh
Ingle has a Google Apps Email address like j.ingle@yourdomain.com, messages sent to
jingle@yourdomain.com don't reach him. (Where do such messages go? That depends on your catch-all
address. Read on to learn what that is.)
As an administrator, you can reset people's Google Apps Email passwords.
NOTE
For organizations that use Premier Edition, a big advantage of Google Apps Email is its spacious 25 GB
mailboxes for everyone in your domain.
This section tells you the things you can do to manage Google Apps Email.
11.2.2.1. Create a catch-all address
Ever wonder what happens to all that email floating around cyberspace that never found its target? (There's no
dead letter office for email.) If you set up a catch-all address, then you won't have to wonder about email sent
to your domain that misses its mark. A catch-all address is just what it sounds like: an inbox for stray messages
that don't match any of the addresses in your domain. Catch-all accounts tend to catch more spam than
anything else, so a lot of organizations don't bother with them. But you might want to create a catch-all address
to capture valid emails with typos in the address, snag emails sent to someone who's left your organization
(whose account you've deleted), or keep an eye on email sent to a suspended user.
NOTE

These instructions tell you how to create a catch-all address in Standard Edition. To learn how to create
one in Premier or Education edition, check out the section on email routing ([click here]).
Before you designate an address as a catch-all, it has to exist. So create an email address ([click here]) like
catchall@yourdomain.com, or choose one of your existing accounts.
Then, on the Control Panel, click "Service settings"
Email to get to the Email Settings page's General tab,
shown in Figure 11-7. This tab's "Catch-all address" section offers these options for dealing with undeliverable
mail:
Figure 11-7. Here's where you tell Google the catch-all address for errant emails that arrive at your
domain.
Discard the email. Nobody gets it.
Forward the email to. Type the name of the catch-all address in this text box.

When you're done, click "Save changes", and you've got yourself a safety net for stray emails.
11.2.2.2. Create an email list
One email, one click, many recipients—that's the beauty of email lists. In Google Apps, you get to the "Create a
New Email List" page in the Control Panel by clicking either "User accounts"
"Create an email list" or "Service
settings"
Email
"Email addresses"
"Create an email list". Whether you take the short road or the long
one, you land on the page shown in Figure 11-8.
Figure 11-8. The name you give your email list is the address you use to send email to everyone on
the list. You can add anyone to an email list, not just people in your domain. This example is for the
Standard Edition; Premier and Education editions also let you add all users in a domain with one
click.
On the "Create a New Email List" page, give your list a name, and then type in a recipient's address. (If you
have Premier or Education edition, then you can add the whole gang at once by clicking the "Add everyone in
my domain" button. Sorry, Standard Edition admins—you have to add recipients one by one.) Recipients don't
have to be part of your domain—you can add anyone with an email address.
NOTE
If you have Premier or Education edition, and you click "Add everyone in my domain," then you can't
tack on any extra recipients, like people outside the domain. Also, to cut back on spam, only an admin
can send email to a list that was created using this feature.

Click "Add recipient" and Google creates the list (Figure 11-9). From here, you can add more people to the list.
When you want to send out an email to everyone on the list, use the list's name as the To address; for example,
newsletter@yourdomain.com or campusevents@statecollege.edu.
Figure 11-9. As you add recipients to your email list, they appear at the bottom of the page.
11.2.2.3. Manage an email list
After you've created an email list, you can add or remove people. To do that, on the Control Panel, select
"Service settings"
Email
"Email addresses". The Email Settings page's Email Addresses tab shows a list of
all the email addresses in your domain, including nicknames ([click here]) and email lists. If the list is long, click
the "show" drop-down list, and then select "Email lists" to filter out the other stuff.
NOTE
If you created an email list by clicking the "Add everyone in my domain" button, then you can't edit that
list.
Find the list you want to edit, and then click its name. This opens the recipient list, which looks similar to Figure
11-9. From this page, you have these options:
Add a new recipient. In the "Add a recipient" box at the top of the page, type an email address, and
then click the "Add recipient" button.
Remove a recipient. Turn on the checkbox next to the person's name (you can select more than one),
and then click the "Remove from this list" button.

Delete the email list. At the top of the page is a "Delete email list" link. Click it, and then confirm your
decision by clicking "Delete list."
11.2.2.4. Turn off targeted ads (Premier and Education editions only)
Regular Gmail accounts deliver advertising along with email messages ([click here]). Some people (okay, the
bean counters at Google) like this targeted advertising, but your users probably have enough distractions
already. They don't need ads vying for their attention with every email they receive.
In Standard Edition, your users are stuck with those ads. But in Premier and Education editions, you can turn
them off. Here's how:
In Control Panel, select "Domain settings".
The Domain Settings page's General tab opens.
1.
Scroll down to the "Advertisement option" section. Here, you find a checkbox labeled "Hide all ads for this
domain". Turn on this checkbox, and then click the "Save changes" button to banish all ads from your
domain.
2.
11.2.2.5. Create an email whitelist (Premier Edition only)
In the old spaghetti westerns, the good guys wore white hats. In Google Apps Email, you put the good guys on
a whitelist. An email whitelist is a list of IP addresses of trusted senders, so their email always gets through,
and doesn't end up stuck in some spam filter somewhere.
To create a whitelist, you need to know the IP addresses whose email you want to let through. An IP address
specifies a computer's location on the Internet, and is made up of four numbers separated by periods, like this:
123.45.67.123.
If you don't know your senders' IP addresses and you have Premier Edition, you can use
Postini ([click here]) to create an approved senders list. Postini Policy Management and
Message Recovery is free with your account.
When you have a list of IP addresses to give the green light to, in the Control Panel, select "Service settings"
Email. In the Email Whitelist section, shown in Figure 11-10, type or paste in the IP addresses you want to
okay, separating them with commas. Click "Save changes", and chalk one up for the good guys.
Figure 11-10. Here's where you tell Google which IP addresses are okay to let through.

How about a blacklist of IP addresses that Google Apps Email should always block? At
the moment, Google doesn't offer this feature at the domain level, but individual users
can create a filter ([click here]) to dump unwanted messages straight into the Trash.
Premier Edition admins can use Postini ([click here]) to block undesirable senders across
the domain ([click here]).
11.2.2.6. Set up email routing (Premier and Education editions only)
Email routing, as its name suggests, lets you create rules for delivering inbound email. It serves as a kind of
virtual traffic cop, directing incoming email where you tell it to. This is handy when you want to create a catch-
all address ([click here]) or set up one of your own servers to store copies of incoming email as a backup. Email
routing can apply to your whole domain or to individual accounts. Sound good?
If you're interested in domain-wide email backup options, then don't forget to check out
some of the backup features you get with the Postini administrative service; more
details on [click here].

To set up email routing, you need to:
Be an admin for a Premier or Education edition Google Apps account, and
Activate Google Apps Email ([click here]), which means your domain's mail exchange (MX) records have
to point to Google ([click here]). If you're using Postini Policy Management and Mail Recovery ([click
here]), then your MX records need to point to Postini. (Email routing works for the messages that Postini
delivers to your Google Apps account.)
NOTE
Google can't route email intended for your domain to Gmail or other Google Apps accounts. So if that's
what you were planning, stop right here.
11.2.2.6.1. Set up email routing for your domain
To get email routing going for your whole domain, follow these steps:
From the Control Panel, select "Service settings"
Email.
The Email Settings page's General tab opens.
1.
Find the "Email routing" section, shown in Figure 11-10. If you're setting up a catch-all address ([click
here]), turn on the "Route to catch-all address" radio button, and then type a name for the catch-all
mailbox. To add more routing addresses, click "Add another address".
2.
The section expands to look like Figure 11-11. This is where you tell Google where to route mail:
Figure 11-11. To route email for your entire domain, tell Google where you want it to send
messages.

Destination. Type the name of a server where you want mail addressed to your domain to go, such as
smtp.yourdomain.com.
Change SMTP envelope. Just like a written letter that you drop in a mailbox, an email message's
"envelope" contains two pieces of info: where it came from (the sender's address) and where it's going
(the recipient's address). Turning on this checkbox instructs Google to rewrite the recipient's address for
routed emails, and send it somewhere else.
For example, if the mail server you're adding (to store backup copies of your firm's incoming emails)
recognizes only addresses belonging to a particular domain or subdomain ([click here]), you have to
change the SMTP envelope so the newly added server can get the mail. That way, when a message
addressed to somebody@yourdomain.com arrives, Google rewrites the email address to
somebody@somewhere-else.com, and then dispatches the email to the additional destination. If you leave
this checkbox turned off, on the other hand, Google routes the email to the additional destination without
rewriting its To address.
Deliver email for. You've got three choices here for the kind of email you want to route:
Unknown accounts only. This setting (selected automatically unless you pick something else)
routes emails whose addresses don't match any of the user names in your domain.

Provisioned accounts only. This option routes email addressed to accounts in your domain.
(Provisioned just means that the account already exists.)
All accounts. This option tells Google to route all email addressed to your domain.
Send bounce notifications. Turn on this checkbox if you want to let senders know when their email
doesn't reach its destination. It's a good idea to turn on bounce notification so people don't think emails
have gotten through when they actually had typos in their To addresses.
If you want, add another destination by clicking the "Add another destination" link at the bottom of the "Email
routing" section, and adjust these same settings over again. When you're all done, click "Save changes."
Google puts your routing instructions into effect (it may take an hour or so).
11.2.2.6.2. Set up email routing for an individual user
You can also set up email routing for just one person's account. You might do this, for example, if someone's
away for a month and you need somebody else to handle his email. Here's how:
In the Control Panel, click "User accounts", and then, on the page that appears, click the person's name.
Google opens his account info page.
1.
Scroll down to the Email Routing section at the bottom of the page and click "Add another destination."
The section expands to look like Figure 11-12. The "Inherit routes from domain" checkbox, already turned
on, means that any email routing changes you make at the domain level ([click here]) affect him. To route
his email to a new destination, you need to tell Google:
Destination. Type in the email address you want email routed to, such as
you@smtp.yourdomain.com.
Change SMTP envelope. If you want Google to rewrite the To address on routed email, turn on
this checkbox. (See [click here] for more info about SMTP envelopes.) Google turns this setting on
automatically unless you change it.
Figure 11-12. The Email Routing section shown here is where you set up email
routing for a particular account.
2.

Fill out the destination (and turn on its checkbox), and then turn the "Change SMTP envelope" checkbox
off, if you want. Then click "Save changes."
Google starts routing that person's email.
3.
After you've set up email routing for someone, you can suspend routing by coming back to his info page, and
then turning off the checkbox next to the destination you added. To delete a destination you've set up, click its
far-right Remove link. Don't forget to click "Save changes" to apply any changes you made.
11.2.3. Chat
Chapter 6 is all about Google Talk and how to use it. Chat is the version of Google Talk that comes with Google
Apps, and it's pretty much the same, with these differences:
With Chat, you have some control (though not a lot) over how the people in your domain communicate.
You can also hide your users' status from chatters outside your domain, and have Google warn people in
your domain when they start to chat with someone outside the domain.
Chat uses domain-specific accounts. That means, to send and receive instant messages through Chat,
people have to sign into their accounts in your domain, as opposed to signing into their personal Google
Accounts.
As with any app, you can disable Chat ([click here]), removing it from your domain altogether.

Instead of you, the admin, having to activate Chat, Google puts a notice on the Dashboard that tells people they
have to download the Google Talk client to sign in ([click here] tells you how to do that). That notice is
potentially a bit misleading, because the folks in your domain are probably already chatting right now from
Email or by using the Google Talk gadget on their Start Pages. (To get an overview of the differences between
the Google Talk client—which you have to download—and the Google Talk gadget—which you don't—see the
box on [click here].)
Google gives you just a few settings you can adjust for people who chat in your domain. Start by going to the
Chat Settings page (Control Panel
"Service settings"
Chat), shown in Figure 11-13. Here's what you'll find
there:
Display users' chat status outside this domain. This checkbox, on by default, means that any contacts
someone has added to Google Talk—whether those contacts are inside or outside your domain—can see
that person's status ([click here]). Turning off the checkbox cuts down on possible distractions by showing
her status only to other folks within your domain. That way, Mark in Marketing can tell when Sally in Sales
is online, but Sally's kids, friends, neighbors, and so on, can't—so she can get more work done.
Figure 11-13. Google Apps gives you limited control over how (and with whom) your users can
chat.
Warn users when chatting outside this domain. Unless you disable Chat entirely, you can't prevent
people from chatting outside your domain. (And, frankly, it'd be kind of silly to try, given all the chat
options available to anyone working on a computer with a Web connection.) You can, however, have
Google display a message box that lets folks know they're starting a chat with someone outside the
domain. It probably won't stop anyone, but it may remind them that they're supposed to be working.

The next part of the "Sharing options" section, which relates to chatting outside the Google Talk network, is
pretty complex; it's probably best left to your IT department or resident tech guru. To let users chat outside the
Google Talk network (with people who use instant messaging services offered by EarthLink, other Internet
service providers, or their universities, for example), you have to adjust your domain's SRV records; the box on
[click here] explains what those are.
Power Users' Clinic: Are You Being SRV'd?
With Chat, everyone in your domain can exchange instant messages with everyone else in your
domain. Additionally, they can talk to anyone in the Google Talk network—and that's a great start.
If you want to let people chat beyond the Google Talk network, you've got to tweak your SRV
records. SRV records (short for "service records") tell computers about a particular service in a
domain. If you don't know how to add or edit SRV records in your domain, you probably shouldn't
try to add other chat networks to Google Chat. But if you're comfortable changing DNS records
([click here]), then go to your domain host and enter these SRV records, replacing mydomain.com
with the actual name of your domain (don't replace google.com, though):
_xmpp-server._tcp.mydomain.com. IN SRV 5 0 5269 xmpp-server.l.google.com.
_xmpp-server._tcp.mydomain.com. IN SRV 20 0 5269 xmpp-server1.l.google.com.
_xmpp-server._tcp.mydomain.com. IN SRV 20 0 5269 xmpp-server2.l.google.com.
_xmpp-server._tcp.mydomain.com. IN SRV 20 0 5269 xmpp-server3.l.google.com.
_xmpp-server._tcp.mydomain.com. IN SRV 20 0 5269 xmpp-server4.l.google.com.
_jabber._tcp.mydomain.com. IN SRV 5 0 5269 xmpp-server.l.google.com.
_jabber._tcp.mydomain.com. IN SRV 20 0 5269 xmpp-server1.l.google.com.
_jabber._tcp.mydomain.com. IN SRV 20 0 5269 xmpp-server2.l.google.com.
_jabber._tcp.mydomain.com. IN SRV 20 0 5269 xmpp-server3.l.google.com.
_jabber._tcp.mydomain.com. IN SRV 20 0 5269 xmpp-server4.l.google.com.
After your domain has updated these records, your users can chat beyond the Google Talk
network. For more info, read the instructions at
http://code.google.com/apis/talk/open_communications.html, and check out Chapter 13.

11.2.3.1. Install Google Talk for Windows Vista
If your organization's computers run Windows Vista, you may discover an annoying quirk about trying to
download and install the Google Talk client: the installation works only for the person who's currently signed in
to Vista. When that person signs out of Visa and someone else signs in, Talk isn't there. Vista treats the Talk
installation as though it's for the individual user, rather than anyone who logs into the computer. This isn't a
problem, of course, if each person has his own computer, but it can be really annoying if some of your
computers are shared.
To get Google Talk on a Windows Vista computer so anyone can use it, follow these steps:
On the computer where you're installing Talk, open a Web browser, and then go to www.google.com/talk.
The Google Talk download page opens.
1.
Click the Download Google Talk button. (To get an overview of the download process, flip back to [click
here].)
The computer downloads the file, googletalk-setup.exe.
2.
Now here's the trick: Right-click googletalk-setup.exe, and then select "Run as administrator".
The installation program installs Talk, and anyone can now use Talk on this computer. (Each user still has
to sign into Talk with her user name.)
3.
Later, if there's a whole lotta chattin' goin' on, and productivity dictates that you uninstall Google Talk, click
Start, find the Uninstall Google Talk shortcut, and then right-click it. Choose "Run as administrator" from the
menu that appears, and then proceed with the uninstall.
11.2.4. Google Calendar
As Chapter 7 explains, Google Calendar lets you schedule events and share them with others, check other
people's calendars to see when they're available, and post public calendars on the Web. In an organization, it's
great for coordinating people's schedules and, if you use Google Apps Premier or Education edition, reserving
resources like conference rooms and audio-visual equipment ([click here]).
When you select "Service settings"
Calendar from the Control Panel (or, from the Dashboard, just click
Calendar), you get to the page shown in Figure 11-14. Here you can set sharing options for all the calendars in
your domain. These sharing options limit what people can do with their calendars within your domain. For
example, if you set calendars to "Share all information", it does not mean that all information automatically gets
shared; instead, it means that people have the option to share all information if they wish. The Calendar
Settings page presents two kinds of sharing options:
Outside this domain. Google assumes you don't want to share people's event details outside the
domain, but you can set outside sharing to any of the following:

Only free/busy information (hide event details). This option means that, on shared calendars,
people outside your domain can see whether someone is busy or available during a certain time slot,
but not the details of the event.
Share all information, but outsiders cannot change calendars. This option lets people outside
the domain view the details of events on shared calendars, but doesn't let them add or edit events.
Share all information, and outsiders can change calendars. This lets anyone, inside the
domain or out, view the details of events on shared calendars and add or edit events.
Figure 11-14. Here's where you choose sharing options for calendars created within your
domain.
Within this domain. The choices in this section let you set a sharing option for how everyone in your
domain shares calendar info with each other. Keep in mind that the setting you choose is just a starting
point for when someone creates a calendar—people can change this setting for their own calendars. Here
are the options:
No sharing. Calendars don't get shared unless people specifically choose to share theirs.

Only free/busy information (hide details). People can see when their colleagues are busy or
available, but not the event details.
Share all information. Google chooses this setting unless you change it. It lets people set their
calendars to share all event information with others in the domain.
When you've selected the sharing options you want, click "Save changes".
11.2.4.1. Create a resource (Premier and Education editions only)
If you're the administrator of a Premier or Education edition account, you can designate and manage
"resources" (conference rooms, projectors, podiums—you get the idea) that people can reserve when they
schedule an event ([click here]).
To create or manage a resource, select "Service settings"
Calendar, and then click Resources to open the
Resources tab, shown in Figure 11-15. (If you don't see a Resources link on your Calendar Settings page, you
have Standard Edition, which doesn't let you create resources; [click here] tells you how to upgrade to Premier
if you want to be able to schedule resources.)
Figure 11-15. Resources you've created appear on the Calendar Settings page's Resources tab
(circled). This "reservation service" feature is available only in Premier and Education editions.
On the Resources tab, click "Create a new resource" to open the page shown in Figure 11-16. Here, fill in the
following info:

Resource name. This is the only field you have to fill in to create a resource.
Resource type. If your organization has a lot of commonly sought after items, it's helpful to categorize
them, so they're easy to find.
Description. Detailed descriptions make it easier for people to reserve the right resource: describe
meeting rooms' capacity, layout, and built-in equipment; give equipment's technical specs; and so on.
When you're done filling out the form, click "Create resource" to add it to your domain's resource list. Now,
people can reserve resources ([click here]) for the events they put on their calendars.
Figure 11-16. You have to name your resources, but it's also helpful to add a type and a description.
11.2.4.1.1. Edit a resource
If you need to modify a resource's record—maybe your organization has reconfigured conference rooms and
names or capacities have changed—make your way to the Resources list (Control Panel
"Service settings"
Calendar
Resources), and then click the resource's name. This opens the Edit Resource page, which
looks just like Figure 11-16, except that the resource's details are already filled in. Click "Save changes" to save
your updates.
11.2.4.2. Delete a resource
When a resource is no longer available, you don't want users trying to reserve it. To get rid of a resource, select

Service settings
Calendar
Resources. Find the obsolete resource and turn on its checkbox. Click the
"Delete resource(s)" button. Google asks you to confirm; click "Delete resource(s)", and it's gone.
11.2.4.3. Manage users' calendars
As an administrator, you have complete access to all the calendars in your domain—even ones that aren't
shared. You can view, add, and edit events in any calendar within your domain. Consider it the end of anyone
being able to say, "But I didn't know about that meeting." Not anymore.
First, though, you need to add the calendar you want to control to your own in Google Calendar. To do so, open
Google Calendar, and then go to the left-hand Calendars list. In the text box under Other Calendars, start
typing the name of the person whose calendar you want to add. If you've turned on contact sharing ([click
here]), then Google suggests possible names as you type. Select the person whose calendar you want, and
Google adds it to your Calendars list. Select the calendar, and you can work with it just like a regular calendar
(see Chapter 7).
When you add domain users' calendars to yours, your My Calendars list can get awfully
long. You can hide some of the calendars ([click here]) to keep the list from getting
unwieldy.
11.2.5. Start Page
After you create a Google Apps account, one of the first things you'll probably do is give your domain's Start
Page a look and feel that represents your organization. That's why customizing your Start Page is covered in
Chapter 10 ([click here]). But you can edit your custom Start Page at any time—from the Control Panel, just
click "Service settings"
Start Page—Customize. Then flip back to the instructions for whatever part of your
Start Page you want to edit:
Colors ([click here])
Header and Footer ([click here])
Content ([click here])
Click Preview to see how your changes look. When you're ready to publish the changes, click Publish, and then
"Publish updates" to update Start Page across your domain.
11.2.5.1. Edit a custom section
When customizing your Start Page's content, you may have created a custom section or two ([click here]) to
hold stuff like notices from Human Resources, a hand-picked newsfeed, or whatever you thought would be
helpful to people in your domain. After you've set up a custom section, you might need to edit it. For example,
if you have a custom section called Weekly Reminders or Notice Board, you (or another admin) will want to
update it periodically.
To edit a custom section, go to the Start Page Editor's Content tab (from Control Panel, choose "Service

settings"
Start Page
Customize
Content), and then click "Add stuff". The Organize Default Content
page opens, looking something like Figure 11-17 (this page is also called the content directory). Find the
custom gadget you created, and then click its Edit link. The Update Custom Section box, shown in Figure 11-18,
opens. Edit the gadget, and when you're done, click Update Section. Google updates your content, and then
returns you to Start Page Editor. Publish your revised Start Page ([click here]) so the edited content appears on
everyone's Start Page.
Figure 11-17. After you've created a custom section, you can edit or remove it by clicking one of the
links beneath it (circled) on the Organize Default Content page.
NOTE
When you publish your updated Start Page, the results can be a little unpredictable—the updates might
take a long time to publish, or they might not publish at all. So when you edit a custom section, give
yourself lots of lead time and check the results by signing out and visiting Start Page.

Figure 11-18. The Update Custom Section box looks just like the box you used to create the custom
section (Figure 10-36).
11.2.5.2. Delete a custom section
When a custom section has outlived its usefulness—maybe it contained progress reports related to the now-
completed food drive, for example—you can remove it from Start Page. Make your way to the Start Page
Editor's Content tab (Control Panel
"Service settings"
Start Page
Customize
Content), and then
click "Add stuff" to open the content directory (Figure 11-17). Find the custom section you want to delete, and
then click its Remove link. Google asks you to confirm your decision. Click OK, and Google deletes the custom
section from Start Page and the content directory.
If you want to take a custom section off of the Start Page without deleting it from the
content directory, go to Start Page Editor's Content tab, click the section's upper-right X,
and then publish Start Page ([click here]). This removes the section from Start Page but
not from the content directory, so you can add it again later if you want.
11.2.6. Web Pages
The generically named Web Pages is the Google Apps equivalent of Page Creator (Chapter 9), which you can use
to create and publish Web pages for your organization. A big difference between the two is that in Google Apps,
only administrators can create, edit, and publish Web pages. To work on a Web page, start from the Control
Panel, and select "Service settings"
Web Pages
"Edit your Web pages". From there, you can work with
Web pages the same way you would in Page Creator (Chapter 9).
When you publish a Web page through Google Apps, Google gives the page a long, clunky URL like
www.yourdomain.com-a.googlepages.com/home. Not exactly easy for visitors to your site to guess at or

remember, is it? Fortunately, you can change the URL to something that's easier on the old brain cells. The
process is identical to customizing the address of any other app ([click here]). Note that you have to be able to
change CNAME records with your domain host (see the box on [click here] to find out what that means) to
customize URLs.
11.2.7. Google Sites
Unlike most of Google's offerings, Google Sites is available only to organizations with Google Apps accounts.
Chapter 12 tells you all about using Sites, Google's challenge to Microsoft SharePoint. Sites lets you a create a
Web site for a project, bringing together documents, calendars, presentations, and more in one place where
people can easily see, edit, and share everything.
As an administrator, you may want to adjust Sites' sharing options to control whom people share their sites with
([click here]). To set sharing options, from the Control Panel, select "Service settings"
Sites. Google opens
the Sites settings page, shown in Figure 11-19. Here are the sharing options you can tweak:
Users cannot share sites outside this domain. If your projects are for employees' eyes only, this is
the option to choose, so folks can't share a site with anyone who has an email address outside your
domain.
Figure 11-19. Google Sites are meant for sharing, but you can decide whether or not people can
share the sites beyond your domain.
Users can share outside this domain but will receive a warning each time. If it's okay to share

sites with trusted partners or independent contractors, but you want people to use a little caution when
sharing, turn on this radio button. That way, when someone goes to share a site with somebody who's not
part of your domain, Google reminds him of that fact, and he has to click OK to continue.
Users can share sites outside this domain (without any warning). This option allows free and open
sharing of sites with anyone who as an email address.
Users can make sites public. Turn on this checkbox if you want to let people create sites and share
them with the world by publishing them on the Web. As [click here] explains, anyone on the Internet can
view a published site without having to sign in, and people can find published sites using search engines
(like Google or Yahoo).
NOTE
When you allow users to share sites outside your domain, it doesn't mean that all sites have to be
shared. Instead, people get to choose whether they want to share specific sites outside of your domain
([click here]).
Set your sharing options, and then click "Save changes" to apply your sharing policy to Sites.
11.2.8. Postini (Premier Edition Only)
Premier Edition administrators get to use some spiffy tools provided by Postini, an email security company that
Google bought in 2007. Postini's Policy Management and Message Recovery (PMMR) package stops spam,
viruses, and undesirable attachments before they reach your domain. Postini estimates that it blocks about 1
billion undesirable messages daily. PMMR also lets you recover accidentally deleted messages, a great way to
keep your sanity when somebody says, "Oops!"
Before you can use Postini's services, you need to activate Email in your domain's Google Apps account. So if
you haven't done that yet, flip back to [click here] and get cracking; then come back here.
11.2.8.1. Activate Postini
After you've activated Email ([click here]), you can enlist Postini's help. It's a rather long and complex process,
but the results are worth it: You get fine-tunable control over your domain's email policies ([click here]) and a
90-day archive that backs up all incoming and outgoing email.
In the Control Panel, select "Service settings"
"Policy Management and Message Recovery" to open the
PMMR Settings page. Click the Activate Postini link. A new window opens, containing the form shown in Figure
11-20.
Figure 11-20. Postini needs some information about you and your organization to set up your
service.

11.2.8.1.1. Step 1: Register
You've got to register with Postini before you can use its service in Google Apps. So fill out the form, which has
these sections:
Company Information. Postini asks for some basic info about your organization. Company name and
address are required; your industry is optional.
Contact Information. Type in your name, email address, and phone number. If you want, you can also
include your job title.
Product. You're signing up for Postini's Policy Management and Recovery Service, so that's already filled
in here. The number of users (based on how many licenses you bought when signing up for Google Apps)
also appears in this section.
Terms and Conditions. Highlights of this section include agreeing that you won't resell Postini's service
or use it for anything besides normal business email, and acknowledging that your Postini service ends if
you close your Premier Edition Google Apps account or downgrade to Standard Edition. Turn on the Accept
radio button to agree to the terms.

After you've filled out the form, click Review Registration.
Postini displays the information you're submitting. Click Edit Registration if you need to make changes.
Otherwise, click Register Now. Postini sends you an email to confirm that you submitted the registration form.
After that, prepare to wait. Eventually, Postini sends you an email containing an activation key—but it can take
up to 2 business days for them to send it. They may send it sooner, but don't hold your breath. Mark this page,
and come back in a couple of days.
11.2.8.1.2. Step 2: Use the Postini Setup Wizard
When Postini's activation email shows up, you can move forward. Follow these steps to activate service:
In the email you got from Postini, copy the activation key, and then click the link to the Postini Setup &
Activation page.
The Email Protection Service Setup & Activation page opens, with a single text box for your activation key.
1.
Paste the activation key into the Activation Key box, and then click the Log In button.
A page opens like the one shown in Figure 11-21. Here, Postini asks for your domain's name, an admin's
email address, a password for accessing Postini, and a time zone.
2.
Figure 11-21. Postini needs some more info before it starts working for you.

Fill out the form, and then click the Set Up Account button.
Postini opens the page shown in Figure 11-22, telling you the next step: changing the mail exchange (MX)
records for your domain. Postini also sends you an email describing how to do that. (The email goes to the
address you just gave Postini.)
0.
Figure 11-22. Don't click that Log In button yet! Before Postini can activate your account, you've got
to make some edits to your domain's DNS settings. Postini emails you all the information so you
make these changes smoothly.

11.2.8.1.3. Step 3: Change your MX records
Now it's back to your inbox to check for another confirmation email (this one doesn't take 2 days to arrive,
though). The email contains the following sections, which have info you need to complete the setup:
Section 1: Your Postini Login Information tells you where to log into Postini (you can do this through
the Google Apps Control Panel) and your user name.
Section 2: Your Domain and Email Host is FYI—you don't need this info to activate Postini.
Section 3: Your DNS MX Records gives you info you need to route your inbound email through Postini.
Section 4: Your Outbound SMTP Records has info you need to give Google to make sure your outgoing
email goes through Postini, too.
The email also has a link to a Web site that gives step-by-step instructions for the setup process. Click the link
to get to the page shown in Figure 11-23, which explains how to change your MX records. You need to change
these records to route your email through Postini.
Figure 11-23. Postini gives you step-by-step instructions for changing MX records in your domain.
Scroll down this page to find specific instructions for a whole bunch of popular domain hosts,
including GoDaddy (relevant for folks who registered domain names through Google—[click here]).

When you activated Google Apps Email ([click here]), you changed your domain's MX records with your domain
host. The process here is exactly the same, except that you use the MX records that Postini sent you instead. So
either flip back to [click here] and go through the steps for changing your MX records again, or follow Postini's
instructions.
NOTE
If you bought your domain name through Google when you signed up for Google Apps, you didn't need
to tinker with any MX records to get Google Apps Email working. But you will need to change these
records to activate Postini. Your domain host is GoDaddy. To find out how to sign in so you can change
your MX records there, see [click here].
You have to wait for your domain host to update your account before you can test whether your Postini setup
worked. This can take anywhere from several minutes to a day. Time to mark the page again so you can come
back here when your domain hosts catches up to your new settings. (Your host will probably mark your domain
as Updating or Pending while the changes are being processed, and Ready when the update is complete.)

You don't have to delete current MX records when you add the ones Postini sent you.
Just make sure that the Postini MX records have higher priority. Once you get Postini
working with Google Apps Email, you can go back and delete the older MX records.
11.2.8.1.4. Step 4: Set Your Outbound Gateway
Changing your domain's MX addresses makes sure that incoming emails go through Postini, for policy checking
([click here] tells you how to set email policies) and archiving (so you can recover deleted messages). To make
sure that outbound emails also take the Postini route, you need to change the gateway for emails sent from
your domain. You do this in Google Apps itself:
In your domain's Control Panel, select "Service settings"
Email.
The Email Settings page's General tab opens.
1.
Scroll down the page to the "Outbound gateway" section shown in Figure 11-24. In the text box there,
type or paste the Outbound SMTP record that Postini sent in Section 4 of its confirmation email. (It looks
something like this: outbounds7.ga.obsmtp.com.) Then click "Save changes."
Google uses that gateway for outbound emails, routing them through Postini.
2.
Figure 11-24. In your Email Settings page's Outbound Gateway section, paste in the outbound SMTP
record that Postini lists in Section 4 of the setup email it sent you.

11.2.8.1.5. Step 5: Test
Good carpenters live by the rule "Measure twice, cut once" to prevent costly mistakes. In the tech world, that
rule is more like "Test a dozen times, deploy once." To make sure you set everything up correctly, you need to
check that the email you send is flowing into and out of Google Apps Email through Postini. You do this by
sending several test emails to and from Google Apps accounts. Include some test emails sent to addresses
outside your domain. Wait an hour or so, then sign into your Postini Administration Console, shown in Figure
11-25 (and explained in the next section), and see whether Postini archived the test messages you sent.
Figure 11-25. The Postini Administration Console's Email Activity section (circled) shows whether
your Postini setup worked: The spikes in email activity show that the test emails went through
Postini, as they're supposed to. The console gives you an at-a-glance view of email activity in your
domain.
If you ever need to restore the MX records that send incoming messages straight to
Google Apps Email (if you downgrade from Premier to Standard Edition, for example),
you can find them in the table on [click here].
11.2.8.2. Sign into Postini

To sign into Postini, start in your Google Apps Control Panel. Select "Service settings"
"Policy Management
and Message Recovery", and then click "Customize your email policies" to open Postini's sign-in page in a new
window. (Or, to go straight to the sign-in page, head to http://login.postini.com/exec/login.) Type in the
administrator login and password you created when you signed up for Postini ([click here]), and then click Log
in. On the page that opens, click System Administration to go to Postini's Administration Console, shown in
Figure 11-25.
The Console gives you an overview of your domain's email activity—one that's much more detailed than the
email quota info that Google Apps offers:
Email Activity. In the center of the Console is a graph that shows email activity during the last hour.
Message Composition. The lower-right pie chart gives a sense of how much of the mail that Postini
processes is good mail, and how much is junk (prepare to be amazed).
Current Activity. This upper-right section tells you what's going on with your domain's email right now.
Customer Care. If you need help using Postini, then click the "Postini Support for Google Apps" link in
this section for a helpful and comprehensive guide.
The following sections will get you started using Postini's features.
11.2.8.3. Set Email Policies
From the moment you activate Postini, it starts scanning your email to protect your domain against spam,
viruses, and potentially harmful attachments—you don't have to do a thing to set that up. But you can fine-tune
Postini by setting email policies for your domain. These policies give you a say in what email gets delivered and
what gets blocked.
To set email policies, sign into Postini, and then Click Message Center
Settings to get to Postini's Message
Center, shown in Figure 11-26. This page is the launch pad for setting the following policies:
Approve Senders. Click this link to open a page where you can create a whitelist ([click here]) of
approved senders. You can approve individual senders, domains, and mailing lists.
Block Senders. If you want to block email from individual addresses or from whole domains, click this
link to create a list of senders you don't want to hear from. Postini stores messages from blocked senders
in its Junk Mail quarantine.
Manage Junk Filters. Click this link to tweak the filters that trap suspicious mail and malicious
attachments. The Junk Email Blocking page, shown in Figure 11-27, lets you adjust how stringently Postini
guards against certain kinds of content, from the sexually explicit to hate mail. Adjust the filter the way
you want it, and then click Save Settings.

Figure 11-26. You can set email policies in Postini's Message Center. You can whitelist or block all
email from certain sources or adjust your junk filters. This is also the place to go to change your
password or other account info.
Figure 11-27. You can adjust Postini's junk filter by making it more or less stringent on several types
of junk.

The stricter you make your junk filter settings, the more messages Postini filters into the
Junk quarantine. If you tighten up your junk filter, check the Junk quarantine often for a
few days. If a lot of legit emails end up there, loosen up the Junk filter a bit.
11.2.8.4. Recover an archived message
One of the big reasons to use Postini is its ability to recover email that a user accidentally trashed. Postini
archives all incoming and outgoing email for 90 days, so you can recover anything sent during that time frame.
To search Postini's archives and recover deleted email, sign into the Postini Administration Console (Figure 11-
25), and then click the upper-right Message Archiving link. The page shown in Figure 11-28 opens. Enter your
search criteria, and then click Search Archive. Postini searches its archives (it may chug along for a few
minutes), and then displays the results.
Figure 11-28. As you can see here, Postini offers a lot of search parameters, so you can pinpoint
specific messages.

In the results list, clicking the title of any email opens it. If you want to print out a copy of an email, then click
its lower-right Printer-Friendly link to open it in a new browser window, ready to print.
You can have Postini archive messages for longer than 90 days—up to 9 years, in
fact—but it'll cost you. To find out more, call Postini at 1-888-584-315 (within the U.S.)
or +1 512-343-5272 (outside the U.S.).
11.2.9. Disabling an App
If one of Google's tools isn't serving your organization's needs, you can disable it. Disabling an app means that
Google packs the application (and all its data) away where people can't access it. That way, you can reactivate
it later if you change your mind ([click here]). (You can't actually delete apps from your domain—disabling is the
closest you can get.)
You disable an app from its Settings page. To get there from the Dashboard, click the app's name. Or you can
select "Service settings", and then, from the drop-down menu, choose the app you want to disable.
On the app's Settings page, click the "Disable [app]" link (the link includes the app's actual name, like Disable
Calendar or Disable Chat). Google opens a warning page, like the one in Figure 11-29, to let you know the
consequences of disabling the app. Read this page carefully—it may warn you about a consequence you hadn't

thought of. For example, disabling Google Apps Email means that you have to change the MX records ([click
here]) in your host domain, or nobody will get any email at all.
Figure 11-29. Before you disable an app, Google warns you of the consequences. If you disable
Calendar, for example, no one in your domain can sign into or check her calendar, but Google hangs
on to calendar data.
If you're still sure you want to disable the service, then click the "Yes, disable App" button. It can take up to half
an hour for Google to put your order into effect, but when it does, none of the users in your domain will have
access to that service (or the data it holds) any more.
NOTE
When you disable an app, Google keeps its data. So later, if you decide to turn the service back on, your
users will once again have access their events or documents or contacts (depending, of course, on the
app).
11.2.9.1. Re-enable an app
If you've disabled an application and you want to restore it to your domain, start at the Control Panel's
Dashboard. In the Service Settings section, click "Add more services". The Google Services page opens, and
shows any apps that aren't currently part of your account. Find the app you want, click its "Add it now" button,
and Google restores it to your domain. Now people can use the app again—they even have access to their old
info, like Calendar events, emails, documents, whatever.
 

 
11.3. Managing Your Domain
Chapter 10 tells you all about the Google Apps Domain Settings page ([click here]), where you view and
manage the settings for your Google Apps account. This section covers a few more domain-wide changes you
might want to make from the Domain Settings page.
11.3.1. Upgrading to Premier Edition
If you administer a Standard Edition account, you may be envious of all the cool tools and perks available to
Premier Edition admins. If you're ready to take Google Apps to the next level, sign into the Control Panel, and
then select "Domain settings"
"Account information." This opens the Domain Settings page's Account
Information tab.
The top section of the Account Information tab, Account Type, tells you which edition of Google Apps you have.
Click "Upgrade to Google Apps Premier Edition" to open a page like the one in Figure 11-30.
Figure 11-30. When you upgrade to Premier Edition, Google calculates the cost based on the current
number of users in your domain. You can buy more accounts than that, but you can't buy fewer. If
you need fewer, go back and delete some, and then come back to this page.

The "Upgrade to Google Apps Premier Edition page" tells you how much it would cost per year to upgrade to
Premier Edition based your current number of users. If you want to buy more accounts than that, type the
number you want in the "additional user accounts," and then click "Recalculate total" to tally the damage.
If you're not sure whether you'll need more user accounts in the future, stick with the
current number for now. You can buy more accounts later—[click here] tells you how.
The Upgrade page also lists terms and conditions for upgrading. These are pretty similar to what you've already
agreed to by signing up for the Standard Edition. Read through 'em and, when you're ready to commit, click "I
accept. Proceed to Google Checkout." As soon as Google validates your card (it doesn't charge you until your
30-day free trial is up), you can take advantage of everything Premier Edition has to offer.
11.3.2. Renewing Your Premier Subscription Automatically
You don't have to lift a finger if you want Google to automatically renew your subscription when it's about to
expire—Google selects this option for you when creating your account.

To find out when your account is up for renewal, sign into Control Panel, and then choose "Domain settings"
"Account information." In the page's Automatic Renewal section is a checkbox, already turned on, labeled
something like "Automatically renew my subscription on 6/17/09"—with the date your account is up for renewal.
Automatic Renewal means that Google charges you for another year when the renewal date rolls around. You
can turn off the checkbox if you want, but it's so convenient to have Google keep track of the renewal date, it's
best to leave it on. If, on the other hand, you don't want to auto-renew because you've decided to switch from
Premier to Standard, turn off the checkbox and read the next section.
11.3.3. Downgrading to Standard Edition
Maybe you've tried out all the features of the Premier Edition and decided your organization can get along just
fine without all those bells and whistles. If that's the case, you can downgrade from Premier Edition to Standard.
You won't lose any data, and users will still have all their apps—and it won't cost you anything.
Before you downgrade, check users' email quotas ([click here]). Standard Edition offers about 6.5 GB of mail
storage per user, as opposed to Premier's 25 GB. If anyone's using more than 6 or so GB, tell him to clean out
his mailbox (emptying the Trash is a good place to start—messages in the Trash count toward the overall email
quota). When he's done, you can proceed.
11.3.3.1. Downgrading during the Premier Edition free trial period
If you're still in the 30-day free trial period, in the Control Panel, go to "Domain settings"
"Account
information", and then click "Cancel Google Apps Premier Edition free trial". On the confirmation page that
appears, click "Yes, cancel free trial".
11.3.3.2. Downgrading after the trial period is up
Google charges for Premier Edition by the year, so there are no refunds if you want to downgrade. (No refunds,
either, if you reduce the number of user accounts.) To make sure that Google doesn't automatically renew your
subscription and charge you for another year, go to "Domain settings"
"Account information", and then, in
the Automatic Renewal section, turn off the "Automatically renew my subscription" checkbox. That way, Google
can't catch you snoozing and lock you in for another year. When your contract is up, you can downgrade to the
Standard Edition.
11.3.4. Managing Your GoDaddy Account
If you bought your domain name through Google when you signed up for Google Apps ([click here]), your
domain is hosted by the massively popular domain host GoDaddy. But it's your domain. If you need to manage
its settings (to activate Postini, for example), you can sign in and adjust whatever settings you need to.
You can sign into your GoDaddy domain right from the Google Apps Control Panel: Select "Domain settings"
"Domain names". The Primary Domain section has an "Advanced DNS settings" link. Click that, and a page
opens telling you your GoDaddy sign-in name and a password. (These are different from the user name and
password you use in Google Apps.) As a bonus, you also get a customer service email address and PIN in case
you need some tech support from the folks at GoDaddy.
To sign into GoDaddy and manage your domain, click the "Sign in to DNS console" link. This opens a sign-in
page where you can type or paste in your GoDaddy customer number and password. Signing in whisks you off
to GoDaddy's Domain Manager, shown in Figure 11-31. From here, you can update your domain's WHOIS
information ([click here]), change MX ([click here]) or CNAME records ([click here]), and work with other
advanced DNS settings.

Figure 11-31. If you bought your domain name through Google, you can manage your domain using
GoDaddy's Domain Manager.
 

 
Chapter 12. Bring Your Team Together with Google Sites
Google Sites takes collaboration to a whole new level. Sure, you can work with others on individual files in
Google Docs or share calendars in Google Calendar, but Sites provides a common staging ground for all those
activities and more. It's not just a Web site where people can work together—it's a Web site that people can
work on together. In geekspeak, that's called a wiki—a site that lets anyone add, edit, or delete content using
nothing more than a Web browser. (Well, maybe not anyone. Don't worry, you can set access permissions.) This
means that people in your organization can work as a team to quickly build specialized sites: for a project, a
training program, a personalized company directory, and way, way more.
In a sense, Google Sites unifies all the Google apps. Embed a spreadsheet on one page, attach files to another,
display a calendar, insert view-on-demand videos and presentations, sprinkle Google gadgets throughout the
pages—the possibilities are limited only by what your team thinks up. Then, invite others to come over and view
or, even better, work on all this stuff together. Sites gives you a central place to share the work you've been
cooking up in all the other apps.
Unlike the other flagship Google apps (Gmail, Calendar, and so on), though, Sites is available only to those with
a Google Apps account. That means you have to be part of a Google Apps domain to use Sites. (If you're not
sure what that means, flip back to Chapter 10.)
Google Sites went live in February 2008, and is still a work in progress. Even so, you'll find it a powerful tool for
bringing your team together.
12.1. Signing In and Creating a Site
When you're ready to get started, follow any of these paths:
If you're already signed into your Google Apps account, open one of your apps, and then click the upper-
left Sites link. Sites opens in a new window.
If you're an administrator, then you can sign in from the Control Panel's Dashboard; look in the Service
Settings section, find Sites, and then click its URL.
Anyone can open a Web browser and go straight to the previous bullet point's URL and sign in: The
address probably looks like sites.yourdomain.com or sites.google.com/a/yourdomain.com.
Finally, you can go to sites.google.com, shown in Figure 12-1. Don't click the blue Get Started button.
Instead, click the upper-right "Returning user, sign in here" link. Google replaces the link with a text box.
Type in your domain name, and then click Go. The familiar Google Apps sign-in page opens. Enter your
Google Apps user name and password, and then click the "Sign in" button.
Figure 12-1. If you're signing into Sites from this page, don't use the big Get Started button; that's
for creating a Google Apps account. Instead, click the upper-right sign-in link (circled).

12.1.1. Create Your First Site
The first time you sign into Sites, a window like the one in Figure 12-2 opens. Click the big blue Create a Site
button; Google gets you started right away, opening the Create New Site page, shown in Figure 12-3.
Figure 12-2. This page welcomes you to Google Sites. At the bottom of the page, click the "Browse
sites" link to take a look at existing sites within your domain. Or click the oversized "Create a Site"
button to get started cooking up a fresh site.

Creating a new site is pretty quick work, and you need only a little bit of information:
Site name. What do you want to call your site? You need to give your site a name for Google to create it.
(It'd be tough to find your site again without a name, anyway.)
Google uses the name you give your site to create the site's URL. If, for example,
your company's Google Sites address is sites.fantasticcorp.com, and you name
your site Training, your site's URL will be sites.fantasticcorp.com/Training. If you
want an easy-to-remember URL, give your site a short name. After Google has
created the site, you can always change its name ([click here]) later; its URL
remains the same.
Figure 12-3. Provide some basic information about your site, and Google creates it.

Site categories. What kind of site are you creating? Associating it with one or more categories of your
choice lets others in the organization easily find it when they're browsing sites ([click here]). Categories
might describe departments in your organization (sales, marketing, IT, research, training), the site's
content or purpose (annual meeting, charity fund drive, Physics 101), or simply feature the name of a
project.
Site description. What's your site about? If you want, enter a short description of your site here. As with
categories, a description can make your site easier to find for those browsing sites. For example, a
professor's site for a class could be one of hundreds at the university. A description helps students find the
right one.
Collaborate with. Who gets access to your site? Some sites are restricted to a chosen few; others let
everybody in the world in for a peek. In deciding whom to collaborate with, you have these options:
Everybody at your domain. This makes your site visible to anyone who signs into Sites through
your domain. People in your domain can find the site by browsing ([click here]), view and edit it
(depending on the permissions you set, [click here]), and subscribe to change notifications ([click
here]).

Only people I specify. If you turn on this option, then you get to choose the people you want to
share with later ([click here] covers how to share a site). No one besides those you invite can find,
view, or work with the site.
Also let anyone in the world view this site. To make the site public to the unwashed masses,
turn on this checkbox. When you open a site in this manner, anybody on the Internet can see it (but
only those you share with can change it).
Site theme. How do you want your site to look? Google offers different themes to customize a site's
appearance. The themes come in various color schemes, and range from the plain and serious to the silly
and glittery. If you want to see more choices, click "More themes", and the section expands to show the
whole gamut. Turn on a theme's radio button to select it (you can always change it later [[click here]]).
When you've configured your new site (for now, anyway), click "Create site". Google obeys your command, and
opens your new Home page, as shown in Figure 12-4.
Figure 12-4. Once it has created a new site, Google opens the home page so you can start adding
content and other pages.

12.1.2. Create Additional Sites
After you've created a site, Google adds it to a list of all the sites you own or share. The next time you sign into
Sites, Google takes you straight to the Your Sites page, shown in Figure 12-5. Go to this list of all your sites
when you want to create a new site. (If you're already signed in, then click the upper-right "My sites" link to get
there.) At the top of your site list you see a "Create new site" button; click that to open the Create New Site
page (Figure 12-4) and add another site to your list.
Figure 12-5. Any sites you've created or collaborate on appears in the Your Sites list. From left to
right, each site shows its name (click to open the site), category (if any), information about who
shares the site, and a description (if any).
12.1.3. Work with Your Sites List
You can always get to a list of all your sites by clicking the upper-right "My sites" link. As Figure 12-5 shows, the
Your Sites page has these sections:
Create new site. Click this button to get started on a fresh, new site.
Sites list. All the sites you own or share, as well as information about how many people share the site
and any categories or description applied to the site. To open a site, just click its name.
Browse sites. Click this link to see a list of sites, organized by category, that exist within your domain.
NOTE

You can browse only those sites that you own, that the owner has chosen to share with you or with
everyone in your domain, or that are public.

share with later ([click here] covers how to share a site). No one besides those you invite can find,
view, or work with the site.
Also let anyone in the world view this site. To make the site public to the unwashed masses,
turn on this checkbox. When you open a site in this manner, anybody on the Internet can see it (but
only those you share with can change it).
Site theme. How do you want your site to look? Google offers different themes to customize a site's
appearance. The themes come in various color schemes, and range from the plain and serious to the silly
and glittery. If you want to see more choices, click "More themes", and the section expands to show the
whole gamut. Turn on a theme's radio button to select it (you can always change it later [[click here]]).
When you've configured your new site (for now, anyway), click "Create site". Google obeys your command, and
opens your new Home page, as shown in Figure 12-4.
Figure 12-4. Once it has created a new site, Google opens the home page so you can start adding
content and other pages.

12.1.2. Create Additional Sites
After you've created a site, Google adds it to a list of all the sites you own or share. The next time you sign into
Sites, Google takes you straight to the Your Sites page, shown in Figure 12-5. Go to this list of all your sites
when you want to create a new site. (If you're already signed in, then click the upper-right "My sites" link to get
there.) At the top of your site list you see a "Create new site" button; click that to open the Create New Site
page (Figure 12-4) and add another site to your list.
Figure 12-5. Any sites you've created or collaborate on appears in the Your Sites list. From left to
right, each site shows its name (click to open the site), category (if any), information about who
shares the site, and a description (if any).
12.1.3. Work with Your Sites List
You can always get to a list of all your sites by clicking the upper-right "My sites" link. As Figure 12-5 shows, the
Your Sites page has these sections:
Create new site. Click this button to get started on a fresh, new site.
Sites list. All the sites you own or share, as well as information about how many people share the site
and any categories or description applied to the site. To open a site, just click its name.
Browse sites. Click this link to see a list of sites, organized by category, that exist within your domain.
NOTE

You can browse only those sites that you own, that the owner has chosen to share with you or with
everyone in your domain, or that are public.
 

 
12.2. Adding Content to Your Pages
As Figure 12-4 shows, when you create a new site, Google presents you with an empty page named Home. But
a home isn't Home, of course, until you fill it up with your stuff. So the first thing you'll probably want to do is
add some text—to welcome people to your site and tell them what it's about. In the pages that follow, you'll
learn how to add everything you might want to mix into your Web site: links, images, videos, tables, and so on.
For now, to get started adding some simple text, click the "Edit page" button; the page changes to look like the
one in Figure 12-6.
Figure 12-6. The page editor lets you add and format text on a Google Sites page.
You can edit two text areas: the title (where it says "Home") and the larger area for content below it. To add or
edit text, just click inside either text area, and start typing. Google automatically gives the first page in a new
site the default title of Home—you can change it if you like, but it's a good idea to have a clear home page so
that, as your site grows, the people who work with you will always know which page is the primary one.
When you're in Edit mode, a toolbar appears above the text areas. Use the buttons here to format your text and

do a few other things:
Save. When you're done adding or editing content, click Save to hang onto your changes, and then exit
Edit mode.
Cancel. This tosses out any changes you made since the last save and takes you out of Edit mode. Think
of Cancel less like an Undo button (described next) and more as a "Revert to the last version of this page
since I clicked Save" button.
When you click the Cancel button, there's no confirmation box to check whether
you really want to leave Edit mode without saving your changes. So be careful not
to hit Cancel by mistake.
Undo/Redo. Clicking Undo reverses your last action. If you want to reverse the Undo, click Redo.
Format. This button gathers a bunch of common formatting actions into a single menu. Some of these
options are also listed separately on the toolbar, and it's probably easier to click them there. Here's what's
on the Format menu:
Clear formatting. If you don't like the way your text looks after you've formatted it, select the text,
and then click this option, which looks like an italic letter T with an x at the bottom. This option can
remove lots of formatting with one click: If you've gotten a little overemphatic by making a word
bold, italic, underlined, and bright red, choosing this option gets rid of all that formatting.
Heading size. If a page is long, split into sections and subsections, use these different heading
sizes to create titles and subtitles to make the page easier to read. Your choices are Heading (H2),
which is big and bold and the same size as the page's title; Sub-heading (H3), which is a little
smaller and works like a section title; Minor heading (H4), which is a bit smaller still and is good for
subsection titles; and Normal paragraph text.
Font family. Choose from six different fonts: Sans Serif (which looks like Arial), Serif (which looks a
lot like Times New Roman), Courier New, Georgia, Trebuchet, and Verdana.
Font size. Font sizes range from 8 points to 24 points
Bulleted list. This option adds bullets in front of the text you've selected (or are about to type).
Numbered list. If you want each list item to start with a number, choose this option.
Indent more.
Indent less.

Align. These three options tell Sites how to arrange your text on the page—left-justified (a straight
margin on the left), centered, or right-justified (a straight margin on the right).
Bold.
Italic.
Underline.
Text color. Select the text whose color you want to change, click this button, and then pick the color you
want (Sites offers 64 colors to choose from).
Text background color. To highlight text for emphasis, select the text, click this button, and then choose
a highlight color.
Link. Click this button (and take a look at [click here]) to insert a link to a Web site or another page
within your site.
Insert. There's a lot you can do with this button. Click it to get a menu of all the things you can insert
into your page:
An image.
A table of contents ([click here]).
Content from your other Google Apps, such as a calendar; a document, presentation,
spreadsheet, or form from Docs; a Picasa slideshow; even a video from YouTube or Google Videos
([click here] tells you how to get content from another Google app into a page in Google Sites.
A gadget. You can choose from Google's extensive gadget gallery ([click here]) or create your own;
[click here] walks you through the steps for inserting a gadget into a page in your site.
Table. Insert or edit a table.
Bulleted list.
Numbered list.
One column. This button makes text stretch across the page in an unbroken line, like a page in a book.

Two column. This button creates two columns for your page's content.
Edit HTML. As with Page Creator (Chapter 9), you can edit a page's HTML—if you know what you're
doing. Clicking this button opens an HTML editor just like the one in Page Creator ([click here]).
Sites doesn't have a spell check for pages. You can check your spelling through the
Google Toolbar ([click here]). Or, if you use Firefox 2 or later as your Web browser,
right-click inside a text area. From the context menu, select "Spell check this field".
Firefox even watches for spelling oopses as you type.
12.2.1. Create a Link
As you add to or edit a page's content, you can create links to other pages within the site or to any site on the
Web. The process is very similar to inserting a link in a document ([click here]) or a Web page ([click here]).
Select the text that will hold the link, such as Click here for the schedule or Our competitor's latest sales figures.
In the formatting toolbar, click Link.
The Create Link box, shown in Figure 12-7, opens. Use the box to insert one of these two kinds of links:
Existing page. When selected, this option shows a list of all the pages currently in your site. Click a page,
and a green checkmark appears beside it. Click OK to create the link.
Figure 12-7. On the left side of the Create Link box, choose the kind of link you want to insert. The
right side changes so you can insert that kind of link. This example links to another page within the
site.

Web address. To link to another page outside your site, click "Web address" on the left side of the Create
Link box. The right side changes to show a text box labeled "Link to this URL". Type or paste in the URL
you want to link to, and then click OK.
Sites transforms the text you selected into a link. When you're done working on the page, click Save.
NOTE
If you don't select any text when creating a link, Sites inserts either the linked page name or the URL
(depending on what you've selected) wherever the cursor is currently positioned.
12.2.1.1. Edit a link
You can pretty easily edit existing links. Open the page you want, and then click its "Edit page" button. With the
page in Edit mode, click the link. A blue box appears like the one circled in Figure 12-8. The box shows the link's
address (click it to open the link in a new window), along with Change and Remove links. Click Change.
Figure 12-8. When you click a link in Edit mode, this box appears, letting you work with the link.
The Create Link box opens (this is the same box you used to create the link, as shown in Figure 12-7). If the
link you're editing is to another page in your site, you may be surprised to see an actual URL (Web address)
instead of the page's name. If you think about it, though, that makes sense: Every file within the Google Apps
kingdom is a Web page. So when you select a page by name, Google translates that name into a URL.

In the Create Link box, either choose a page in the site or enter a URL, as you did when you created the link.
Click OK to change the link. Back in Edit mode, click Save to save your edit.
12.2.1.2. Remove a link
If a link is broken or no longer relevant, you can remove it from the page, so viewers aren't chasing down a
blind alley trying to click it. In Edit mode, click the link to summon the blue box shown in Figure 12-7. Click
Remove, and Google erases the link for the text, without removing the text itself.
If you remove a link by mistake, clicking the Undo button won't bring it back. But if you
click Undo three times in a row, Google reinserts the link.
12.2.2. Insert an Image
To add an image to your page, position the cursor where you want the picture to appear, and then click Add
Image. This opens the Add an Image box, shown in Figure 12-9. If you've uploaded any images in the past, they
appear here. If you see the image you want, click it to select it, and then click Add Image to place the image in
your page.
Figure 12-9. Any images that you (or a collaborator) have uploaded to your site's content warehouse
appear in the Add an Image box. Select an existing image or click Browse to upload a new one.
As with other apps, you can get an image into Sites by uploading it from your computer or by telling Google
where to find the image on the Web.
12.2.2.1. Upload an image from your computer
Click Add
Image to open the Add an Image box shown in Figure 12-9. The Upload Images radio button
should already be selected. Click the Browse button to open a box where you can find the image on your
computer. Select the image you want, and then click Open. Your computer uploads the image, and Google
displays it in the Add an Image box. Click Add Image to insert the image into the page you're editing.
12.2.2.2. Link to an image on the Web

If the image you're adding lives somewhere out there on the Web—for example, if you store it at a photo-
hosting site like Snapfish, Flickr, or Google's own Picasa Web Albums—all you need to do is tell Google where to
find the picture. Google takes care of the rest, displaying the image on your page.
In Edit mode, Click Add
Image to open the Add an Image box. Turn on the "Web address" radio button, and
the box changes to look like the one in Figure 12-10. In the Image URL box, type or paste the URL where
Google can find the image. Google shows a preview of the image to confirm that the URL is correct. Click Add
Image to put the image in your page.
Figure 12-10. When you insert an image into a page by linking to the image's address on the Web,
Google shows you a preview. Click the Add Image button to insert the image.
To move an image once you've inserted it onto a page, simply drag and reposition it.
12.2.2.3. Edit an image
Chances are an image won't look exactly perfect when you first insert it. You may have to move or resize it, for
example. If an image doesn't look quite the way you want it, open the page in Edit mode, and then click the
image. A long, narrow blue box appears underneath it, as Figure 12-11 shows. This box holds your editing
options for adjusting the image:

Align. You can line up the image along the left or right side of the column in which it appears. You can
also center it within the column.
Figure 12-11. When you click a picture or other image in Edit mode, your editing options appear. For
more precise resizing options than what you get with the small, medium, and large choices, drag one
of the image's handles (circled).
Size. The options are small, medium, large, and original (the size of the image as Google uploaded it).

You can also resize an image using one of the size-tweaking handles that appear
(see Figure 12-11). Put your cursor over one of the handles; when the cursor
becomes a two-way arrow, click and drag the image to change its size.
Wrap. Click "on" if you want text to wrap around an image that appears next to it (in Figure 12-11 the
text to the right of the lower image wraps around the image). Click "off", and text won't wrap.
Remove. Click this link to delete the image from your page.
12.2.3. Insert Content from Another App
Easy collaboration is one of the big reasons people sign up for Google Apps: You can easily speed up the
workflow by sharing documents, calendars, and more. Google Sites offers another way to share and collaborate:
by gathering together related files, calendars, photos—even Web-based forms to feed data into a
spreadsheet—all in one place.
12.2.3.1. Insert a Calendar
You might want to insert a company calendar, a project calendar showing meetings and deadlines, or a Human
Resources calendar showing holidays, timesheet due dates, and paydays. Whether your calendar is specific to a
certain group or shows the world what your organization is doing (and when), you can insert any calendar
you've created in Google Calendar.
When you insert a calendar into a page on your site, changes you make to it in Google Calendar automatically
update in Sites, as well.
First, of course, the calendar has to exist. So hop over to Google Calendar and set one up. (Chapter 7 gets you
going with creating calendars and filling them up with events.) Make sure that everyone who has permission to
view your Google Site also has permission to view the calendar. Embedding a calendar in a site doesn't change
the permissions for the calendar; you have to set those in Google Calendar itself ([click here]).
Next, you have to copy the calendar's URL. While you're still in Google Calendar, go to the bottom of the left-
hand Calendars list, and then click "Manage calendars". Click the name of the calendar you're adding to Sites.
On the Details page that opens, scroll down to the Calendar Address section, and then click its HTML button. A
box opens, showing the URL for this file; copy the URL.
If you want to make sure that viewers can see your Google Calendar without having to
sign into Calendar separately, use its private address. In Calendar, you can find the
private address by clicking "Manage calendars", clicking the calendar's name, and then
scrolling down to the very bottom of the calendar's Details page, to the Private Address
section. Click the HTML button, and then copy the calendar's Private Address URL. Keep
in mind, though, that if your site is public ([click here]), anyone can view your calendar.
Now you're ready to go back to Sites and insert the calendar. Open the page where you'll insert it, and then

click "Edit page" to go into Edit mode. Click to place the cursor where you want the calendar to appear, and
then select Insert
Calendar. Sites responds with the Insert Calendar box, shown in Figure 12-12.
Figure 12-12. To insert a calendar into a Google Sites page, you need to provide Google with the
Calendar's address on the Web. If you want, you can adjust the calendar's size and display options.
Here's the info Google needs:
Web address. Paste the URL you just copied into the text box. (If Google can't find the calendar at this
address, it tells you right away. Go back to Calendar, and then try again, making sure you click the HTML
button.)
Height. Google presets this dimension at 600 pixels, which is probably what you want, but you can adjust
the setting if necessary.

Width. To make the calendar take up the full width of the column in which it appears, leave this blank.
Otherwise, you can specify the width in pixels.
View. How do you want the page to display the calendar? Choices are Week, Month, and Agenda.
Show. You can turn these checkboxes off or on, as you like, to display or hide these elements of the
calendar:
View tabs. If you don't want others to be able to switch from, say, Month view to Week view, turn
off this checkbox.
Calendar title. You can show or hide the title as you prefer.
Navigation buttons. These buttons let viewers move ahead or back in the displayed calendar. If
you want them to see only the current view (for example, just this month), then turn off this
checkbox.
Date. Usually, the date shows just above the calendar on the left. The date displayed matches the
view: for example, November 2008 for Month view, November 2–8 2008 for Week view, and Monday
November 3 2008 for Agenda view ([click here]). Viewers can click the date to navigate through the
calendar. If you don't want the date and navigation drop-down list to show, turn off this checkbox.
When you've filled out the information in the Insert Calendar box, click Save. Back in the page editor, click Save
again, and you can see how the calendar looks on your page.
NOTE
Administrators can restrict users' ability to let people outside the domain view or work with calendars;
[click here] explains how.
12.2.3.2. Insert a Google Docs document or spreadsheet
When you embed a document or spreadsheet, the Sites page displays it on the page. The version people see on
Sites is read-only; to edit it, you (and your collaborators) have to go to Google Docs. As you update a document
or spreadsheet in Docs, the version embedded in Sites updates, as well.
The steps for embedding a file in a Google Sites page are the same for documents and spreadsheets. First, get
the URL of the document or spreadsheet you want: Open Google Docs, and then open the actual document.
Make sure that the document is either shared ([click here]) or published ([click here]). Copy the URL that
appears in your browser's address bar.
Back in Google Sites, open the page where you want to embed the file, making sure you're in Edit mode (click

its Edit page button). Click Insert
Document or Insert
Spreadsheet, depending on the kind of document
you want to insert. A box like the one in Figure 12-13 opens.
Figure 12-13. Whether you're inserting a word processing document or a spreadsheet, tell Google
where to find the file by entering the URL in the top field, and (if you want) set its dimensions.
The box is called Insert Document or Insert Spreadsheet, depending on what you're inserting, but the process is
the same. Paste in the document's URL and, if you want, adjust its height and width for display on the page.
Click Save. Google inserts the document, and then takes you to the page editor. Click Save to exit the editor
and see the document.
12.2.3.3. Insert a spreadsheet form
Google Docs lets you create a form from a spreadsheet, and post the form live on the Web; when people fill out
the form, the information they supply gets piped straight into the spreadsheet. If you've created a spreadsheet
form in Google Docs ([click here] tells you how), then you can put the form in a Sites page to gather whatever
information you want to collect.
First things first. Go to Google Docs, and then create a spreadsheet form. Copy the spreadsheet's URL (the text
in your browser's address bar when the spreadsheet is open). Back in Google Sites, open (in Edit mode) the
page that will hold the form. Click Insert
"Spreadsheet form" to open the box shown in Figure 12-14. Paste
in the spreadsheet URL, and then, if you want, tweak its dimensions. Click Save to insert the form, and then
Save again to see it on the page.
Figure 12-14. If you've created a spreadsheet that has an associated form for collecting data, you
can insert that form into a page. Paste the spreadsheet's address into the "Insert Spreadsheet form"
box.

12.2.3.4. Insert a Google Docs presentation
You can insert a slideshow-style presentation into a Google Sites page, for others to view whenever they want.
All you need is the presentation's URL. Start by opening the presentation in Google Docs and copying its URL.
Open the page where you want the presentation to appear, and then switch to Edit mode. Put your cursor in the
spot where you'd like Google to insert the presentation, and then select Insert
Presentation. The Insert
Presentation box opens, as shown in Figure 12-15. Paste the presentation's URL into the text box, and then click
Save. Back in the page editor, click Save again. Figure 12-16 shows what an embedded presentation looks like.
Figure 12-15. Google needs a presentation's address on the Web to insert it on a Sites page.
Figure 12-16. Embedded presentations appear in a mini-slideshow viewer. People looking at the
presentation can move to the next or previous slide (circled left) or click the "menu" button (circled

right) to get the code to embed this presentation on their own Web pages.
12.2.3.5. Edit the appearance of content inserted from another Google app
Whether you inserted a calendar, a document, or a form, Google gives you the ability to tweak the appearance
of these items in Sites. Open the relevant page in the Sites' page editor, then click the box representing the
inserted content—for example, a calendar. The blue edit box pops up, as Figure 12-17 shows. From that box,
you can work with these options:
Properties. Click this to open the Properties box. It looks just like the Insert box you used to insert the
content, with its current info already filled in. Make any changes you want, then click Save.
Figure 12-17. If you've inserted some kind of content from another Google app, click the inserted
item in Edit mode to make changes.

Align. Move the calendar (or document, presentation, or any other content) to the left, right, or center of
the column that holds it.
Wrap. Choose "on" to let text wrap around the calendar (or whatever), "off" to prevent wrapping.
Remove. Click Remove to delete the calendar or other inserted object from the page.
When you've finished editing, click Save to exit the page editor and save your changes.
12.2.4. Insert a Video
Videos can be a great addition to a site. Consider the possibilities: a welcome message, on-demand training,
inspirational clips of Herculean feats. You can insert videos from YouTube or Google Videos. So the first order of
business is to head to one of those sites, find a video to insert, and then copy its URL. (When you play a video,
that video has a unique URL that appears in your browser's address bar, something like
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qr-KA8bjAY—that's what you want to copy.)
NOTE

You can, of course, upload your own videos to YouTube; the site's Help center has an easy-to-follow
collection of tutorials on posting (and making private) your own videos.
Back in Sites, open the page where you want the video to appear, and then click "Edit page". Position the cursor
wherever you want to place the video. Then click either Insert
Video
Google Video or Insert
Video
YouTube Video; the Insert Video box opens. Paste in the URL you copied to tell Google where to find the video.
Click Save, and Google inserts the video. Now people who visit the page can click the Play button and watch the
video.
YouTube and Google Video use slightly different players to show videos. Figure 12-18 gives you an idea of the
differences: The Google Video player is slightly smaller and its lower-right Google Video button has only one
option, which is to go to the Google Video site. When a viewer clicks the lower-right menu button in the
YouTube player, she can copy code to embed the video in her own site, or grab a copy of the video's URL. After
a video has finished playing, the YouTube player also offers related videos that the viewer can click and watch
right from the page.
Figure 12-18. When you click the YouTube player's lower-right "menu" button (circled), the video
shrinks to reveal code for viewers who want to embed the video in a Web site or copy its URL.
(Normally, the video takes up the whole player.) When you click the Google Video player's lower-
right Google Video button (also circled), the only choice is to go to Google Video.
12.2.5. Insert a Picasa Web Slideshow
Picasa Web Albums is a Google site for storing, organizing, and sharing digital photos. With Picasa, you can
upload a bunch of photos, organize them into an album, and then view that album as a slideshow. You can also

show a Picasa photo slideshow on a Google Sites page: candid shots from the company picnic, a rogue's gallery
of executives, an overview of products—whatever would add a little visual pizzazz to your site.
Start at Picasa (http://picasaweb.google.com). Open the album you want, and then, from your browser's
address bar, copy its URL. Then zip back over to Google Sites. Navigate to the page where you want the
slideshow to appear; click the page wherever you want to position the slideshow, and then select Insert
"Picasa Web slideshow". The box shown in Figure 12-19 opens. Here's what it contains:
Web address. Paste your Picasa album's URL here.
Figure 12-19. Besides telling Google where to find your Picasa Web album, select a size for the
images in the slideshow. You can show captions (if your photos have them in Picasa) and set the
slideshow to start automatically when someone opens the page.
Select slideshow options. How big do you want the slideshow to be on your page? These are your
choices:
Small (144 pixels).
Medium (288 pixels).
Large (400 pixels).

Extra large (600 pixels).
Extra extra large (800 pixels).
Show captions. If you've added captions to your Picasa photos, and want to include them on your Sites
page, then turn on this checkbox.
Autoplay. Turning on this checkbox means that the slideshow begins automatically when someone opens
the page. If you turn off the checkbox, viewers must start the show themselves.
Click Save, and then Save again. You can see the slideshow in your page, just as others will when they visit
your site.
12.2.6. Insert a Gadget
Chapter 8 takes you on a tour through the wonderful world of Google gadgets, mini-applications that you can
embed in iGoogle or Page Creator, as well as other Google apps. Gadgets can give you current local weather,
the latest news headlines, a self-contained place to chat using Google Talk, a peek at your Gmail Inbox, and a
whole lot more. When you insert a gadget into a Google Sites page, it updates automatically, keeping track of
the current time, for example, or posting new content from an announcements page ([click here]) as soon as
the author saves that content.
You can insert two kinds of gadgets into a Google Sites page:
Custom gadgets that relate only to this site.
Prewritten gadgets, which you can easily find and add from an ever-growing public library that Google
provides.
This section gives you the lowdown on getting both these kinds of gadgets into Google Sites.
12.2.6.1. Insert a custom Google Sites gadget
Sites lets you create several kinds of specially formatted gadgets for specific purposes, including these:
Announcements. A blog-style page that's perfect for short notices and announcements. The most recent
posts (you choose how many) appear here, where they're sure to get people's attention ([click here] tells
how to create an Announcements page).
File Cabinet. As its name suggests, this kind of page holds files (the five most recent) that users have
uploaded to the site. These gadgets are great for sharing commonly used documents among team
members. To see how to create a File Cabinet page, jump ahead to [click here].

Text gadget. A handy little doodad of a gadget, perfect for posting snippets of text.
To insert a custom Sites gadget, open the page in the page editor, and then, in the formatting toolbar, click
(you guessed it) the Insert button. From its menu, choose one of these options:
Recent Posts. To insert this kind of gadget, you need to have an Announcements-type page somewhere
in the site. Google opens the box shown in Figure 12-20, which asks for this info:
Gadget title. The name that appears in the title bar at the top of the gadget.
Pull posts from. Choose the Announcements page that will provide the gadget with its content.
Show___ entries. Specify how many posts to show (they'll display from most recent to earliest).
Figure 12-20. You can create your own gadget to display content drawn from another page within
the site. Here, the gadget displays posts from a blog-style Announcements page.
Recently Uploaded Files. If you or someone else has created a File Cabinet page in the site, this gadget
shows the most recently uploaded files. Its Insert box is almost identical to the one in Figure 12-20, with
these sections:
Gadget title. Name your gadget so people will know what kind of files it's holding.
Show files from. Use the drop-down list to select the File Cabinet page the gadget will track.

Show___ entries. How many files do you want the gadget to display at one time (starting with the
most recent and working back in time)?
Text. A text gadget presents text that stays the same until you change it. When you choose this option,
the Insert Text box, shown in Figure 12-21, opens. Give the gadget a title, go into the mini–text editor,
and then type your content.
Figure 12-21. To create a gadget that holds static text (it doesn't change until you go back and edit
it), give the gadget a name, and then type the content into the text editor.
Whichever kind of custom gadget you choose, click Save to insert the gadget, and then Save again to exit the
page editor. Your newly gadgeted page looks something like the one in Figure 12-22.
Figure 12-22. The right side of the page shows two custom gadgets: The top one features
announcements, and the bottom one shows files that have been uploaded to the site most recently.
Both gadgets update their content automatically.

12.2.6.2. Select a gadget from the gallery
Besides gadgets you create yourself, you can choose from dozens and dozens of gadgets that Google makes
available for your page-designing convenience. To select one for your page, open the page in Edit mode, and
then select Insert
More. This opens the "Add a gadget to your page" box, shown in Figure 12-23. From this
box, you can view and choose predesigned gadgets, from the silly to the interesting to the productive. Search
for a particular gadget using the Search box at the top, or use the left-hand categories to browse. When you
find a gadget you like, click it for a preview, and then set it up for display on your page.
Figure 12-23. This box doesn't even scratch the surface of all the gadgets Google makes available for
your pages. Browse the left-hand categories to see more.

The "Set up your gadget" box, shown in Figure 12-24, shows the gadget you chose, and lets you adjust its
settings, so it looks the way you want it to on the page. (If you don't get the settings right the first time, you
can come back and edit them later.) As you adjust settings on the left, the gadget preview on the right changes
to reflect your adjustments. When the gadget looks good, click OK to insert it. If you want to move the gadget,
then you can drag it into a new position. Click Save when you're ready to leave the page editor.
Figure 12-24. As you make adjustments to the gadget in the box's left side, the preview on the right
side changes in response.

Figure 12-25 shows an example of a gadget on a page.
Figure 12-25. Here's the Date & Time gadget inserted into the upper-right part of the page.
If you know of a gadget (or widget, as the world beyond Google calls these mini-
applications) out there on the Web that you'd like to add to a page, then you can add it
by grabbing its URL. First copy the URL. Then, in Sites, open the page in Edit mode, and
then click Insert
More. When the "Add a gadget box" opens, click "Add by URL" (it's
to the right of the Search button). The box expands so you can paste in the URL. When
you've done that, click Add to place the widget on your page.

Workaround Workshop: Add a Gadget from a Spreadsheet
If you added a gadget or two to your Google Docs spreadsheets ([click here]), like a pivot table or
an organization chart, you might want to display those gadgets in Google Sites, too, so that the
gadget can show up-to-the minute info as the spreadsheet changes. But Sites doesn't yet have a
Spreadsheet Gadget on its Insert menu.
You can still put a spreadsheet gadget on a Google Sites page. To do that, you first need to find
and copy the gadget's address within your spreadsheet. Open the spreadsheet. In the gadget's
upper-right corner, you see a drop-down arrow. Click that, and then select "Get query data source
url". The box that opens shows a URL that starts with
http://spreadsheets.google.com/a/yourdomain.com and goes on from there with a lot more
characters. Copy this URL.
Back in Sites, open the page (the one where you want to insert the gadget) in Edit mode. Select
Insert
More. In the box that opens, click "Add by URL", and paste in the gadget URL you copied
from the spreadsheet. From there, preview and insert the gadget.
12.2.7. Work with Tables
As you create pages, you'll probably want to insert a table now and then. The page editor makes it easy to do
so.
12.2.7.1. Insert a table
To put a blank table in a page, click Table
"Insert table." A flyout menu appears, as Figure 12-26 shows,
where you choose the number of columns and rows with which to start. Move your cursor over the grid to
choose the size of the table, and then click to insert it.
Figure 12-26. Use the grid to determine the size of your table. (At first glance this figure might look
a little confusing: The flyout menu showing the grid is actually a "child" of the "Insert table" menu
option; the grid flies out to the left because there's not enough room on the right side.)

If you want to create a table that's bigger than the five-by-five grid, move your cursor
outside the grid to make it expand.
Once you've got the table in the page editor, click any cell, and then start typing. The Tab key or the arrow keys
move you from one cell to another.
12.2.7.2. Edit a table
When you need to make changes to a table you've inserted, use the Table menu. Click the Table button, and
then choose from these options:
Add Row. Choose whether you want the new row to appear before or after the currently selected cell or
row.
Add Column. You can insert a new column before or after the current selection.
To select a range of cells in your table, click a cell, and then hold down the mouse
button as you move the mouse to define the range. Let go of the button when
you're done. Adding a column or row when you've selected multiple cells uses the
first cell to position the column or row you're adding
Remove Row(s).
Remove Column(s).
Remove Table.
12.2.7.3. Resize a table
If your table's cells are looking a bit cramped—or if they're so big that the data's getting lost inside them—you
can make the table bigger or smaller. Click the table, and handles appear around its borders. Click and drag a
handle to resize the table.
12.2.8. Attach and View Files
If you know how to browse for files on your computer, you already know how to add an attachment to a Google
Sites page. Attachments appear as links below the main content area of the page; scroll down to find a section
called Attachments. That section holds a box labeled "Attach a file". Click its Browse button, and then find the
file you want to attach. Select the file, click Open, and Google attaches the document.

Attachments appear in a list of file names, as shown in Figure 12-27. Viewers simply click a file to open it.
Figure 12-27. Most Sites pages have an Attachments area at the bottom, where you can attach and
view files, and a Comments area, where you can read and leave comments.
If you have a lot of attachments that you want to keep together, create a File Cabinet
page ([click here]).
12.2.9. Add a Comment to a Page
When you're working on a site, you may have a question that you want to toss out or applause to offer someone
for a job well done. The bottom of most pages have a place for comments, where you can chime in with your
thoughts, questions, and ideas.
Open a page, and then scroll down to the bottom to find the Comments section. Comments appear below
attachments, as Figure 12-27 shows. Read comments, and then respond by typing in the big text box. When
you've had your say, click Add comment, and your comment gets added to the list.
If you have a change of mind (or a change of heart), you can remove any comment you contributed by clicking
its Remove link. To keep the peace, administrators ([click here]) can remove any comment from the list, no
matter who made it.

If you accidentally remove a comment, scroll up, and then, in the yellow bar at the top
of the page, click the Undo link.
12.2.10. Create a New Page
Pages within a site are like chapters in a book—related, but each containing a different kind of information. As
you build your site, you'll want to add new pages to keep things streamlined. From any page in the site, click
the upper-left "Create new page" button; the page shown in Figure 12-28 opens. From here, you have five
different page types to choose from (each one's described in the following sections). Once you've made your
pick, give the page a title. Now you need to decide where to place the newly created page within your site's Site
Map:
Figure 12-28. Click "Create new page" (circled), and then pick the kind of page you want to create.
See [click here] for advice on picking where in your overall site to place your new page.
Put page at the top level. Top-level pages are the main pages of your site. They don't belong to other
pages as subpages. For example, a site's home page is always a top-level page. When you look at the Site
Map in Hierarchy view ([click here]), top-level pages are those farthest to the left.
Put page under current page. You have the option to make the new page a subpage of whatever page
you're on when you click "Create new page". A subpage belongs to the page it's under—when you delete a

page ([click here]), you also delete all its subpages. Subpages let you group pages with related
information. For example, if you're working on a page called Document Library, you might want to add a
related subpage listing related books in the corporate library.
Finally, click "Create page" to open it in Edit mode.
12.2.10.1. Create a Web page
When you click "Create new page", Google preselects Web Page as the type of page you probably want to
create. This page style should be familiar; it's the type of page that opened when you first created the site. It
has a title, space for content, and, below that, sections for attachments and comments.
12.2.10.2. Create a Dashboard page
A Dashboard page is basically a collection of gadgets ([click here]). As such, a Dashboard is a great place to pull
together different apps and gadgets relevant to your site: a calendar to keep track of project deadlines, your
Gmail Inbox, a list of files that have recently changed in Google Docs, and so on.
When you first create a new Dashboard, it opens in Edit mode and looks like the page in Figure 12-29. Google
starts you off with spaces for four gadgets (you can have as many or as few as you want). Click a box's Gadgets
button to see the Insert menu ([click here]), where you can choose the kind of content, file, or gadget you want
to insert in this space. Whatever you choose, the process is exactly the same as if you were adding the item to
a Web page–style page, so flip back to the relevant section of this chapter if you want a reminder of how that
works.
Figure 12-29. Fill up a Dashboard page with as many gadgets as you like. Click a Gadgets button to
see the Insert menu, and then start putting gadgets where the placeholders are. You're not limited
to just four gadgets, either. When you're ready to add more, click the Insert button in the formatting
toolbar, and keep on going with gadgets.

12.2.10.3. Create an Announcements page
Turn on Announcements to create a blog-style page where team members can write and publish short posts.
When you first create an Announcements page, the page is empty except for its title and a "New post" button.
Click "New post" to open a text editor where you can name and write your announcement or other post. When
you're done, click "Create post" to add your entry to the page.
As an Announcements page accumulates posts, it looks like the one shown in Figure 12-30. The most recent
post is at the top of the list. Click "New post" to open the text editor and write a new announcement. Each post
you write creates its own page as a subpage ([click here]) to the Announcements page. You can edit these
subpages like any other Google Sites page.
Figure 12-30. An Announcements page looks like a blog. Each post has a title and some text, with
the most recent one at the top. You can edit posts that you wrote; administrators can edit any post.

12.2.10.4. Create a File Cabinet page
People use file cabinets to store and organize important documents—or they did, back in the Age of Paper.
Google Sites has a kind of virtual file cabinet, a page where you can collect documents (and other files) all in
one place, so you can easily find them. A File Cabinet page looks like the page in Figure 12-31.
To add a new file to the File Cabinet, click Upload. In the Upload File box that opens, browse to the file you want
to add, select it, and then click Open. Add a description of the file if you want. Click Upload to add the file.
Figure 12-31. A File Cabinet page is a list of attached files that site users can open. Click Upload to
add a new file.

To remove a file from the list, turn on its checkbox, and then click the Delete button.
Google doesn't ask for confirmation before it deletes—and there's no Undo button—so
make sure you've got the right file.
12.2.10.4.1. Create a folder
If a physical file cabinet doesn't have folders to keep stuff organized, the papers that fill its drawers get
crammed in any old which way. A virtual file cabinet is no different. Folders help you organize the documents
and other files stored inside a File Cabinet page. To create a folder, open the File Cabinet page, and then, above
the list of files, click the "Move to" button. (You can see this button in Figure 12-31; it has a picture of a folder
on it.) From the menu that appears, select "New folder". Google opens a "New folder" box for you to give the
folder a name. Do so, click OK, and Google adds the folder to the list.
12.2.10.4.2. Move files to a folder
After you've created a folder, Google adds it to the "Move to" menu. To get some files into that folder, turn on
the checkboxes of the files you want to move. Click "Move to", and, from its menu, select the folder you want.
Click OK, and Google whisks them into that folder for you.
You can create a folder and move files into it at the same time. Select the files, and then click "Move to"
"New folder". Name the folder, click OK, and Google creates the folder and fills it with files, all in one step.
NOTE
At this time, you can take a file out of a folder only when you move it to a different folder. You can't
move a file out of a folder and back to the top level of the files list.
12.2.10.5. Create a List page

Organized people make lists for everything: to-do lists, grocery lists, top 10 lists, and so on. Google wants you
to be organized, too—so you can create four different kinds of List pages for your site. A List page organizes
information in table form: Each record, or unit of information, is made up of several different fields, or types of
information. For example, if you were going to create a customer list, each customer would be one record,
taking up one row of the list. And each record would be made up of several different types of information (think
of these as columns): customer name, customer number, street address, city/town, state, Zip code, and so on.
Read across a row to get a complete picture of one customer; read down a column to find one customer name
among many.
12.2.10.5.1. Use a template
Google's predesigned templates come with ready-made categories, or fields, so you can easily pull together the
information you need for each list item. When you create a new List page, you can select one of these
templates, as Figure 12-32 shows:
Figure 12-32. If you're looking to track projects containing things like action items or open issues,
try one of Google Sites' prebuilt templates to organize your information (you can also customize
each template). If you want to create a truly unique list, click "Create a custom list".
Action Items. This list template helps you track what needs to be done and who's doing it. Choosing this
template creates a page with these ready-to-use categories: Owner, Description, Resolution, Complete.
Issue List. Have you ever completed a project where everything went smoothly and no problems came
up? Neither has anyone else. Use this template to keep track of "issues" (aka problems) as they arise, and
follow them through to the solution. Categories are Raised by, Owner, Priority, Issue, and Resolution.
Unit Status. This is an all-purpose template that helps you keep track of how a feature's status changes
during a project's lifetime. Categories for each record include Status, Owner, Feature, and Design (URL). If
your company makes handcrafted furniture, for example, this page could track the progress of custom
orders: the Feature might be a dresser, Status could show whether the dresser is being built or has
shipped, the Owner could be the craftsman who's building it, and the Design could link to the plans for the
dresser. Units don't have to be physical items, though—you can use this template to track design

specifications or bug fixes in a software development project. Anything that moves through a process is a
good candidate.
Is one of these lists close, but not exactly what you want? You don't have to settle
for almost. Select a template to create your List page. When Google creates the
page, click its "Customize this list" link to open a box like the one in Figure 12-33.
And read on to find out how to customize the List page you've created.
12.2.10.5.2. Customize a list
If Google's prebuilt templates aren't what you have in mind, you have another option: Design your own List
page. Google gives you a lot of flexibility to create precisely the list you want. On the page that shows the
templates, click "Create a custom list" to open the box shown in Figure 12-33. This box lets you define your own
categories of information, so each item on your list tracks exactly what you need to follow. (It's the same box
that opens if you click "Customize this list" on an existing List page.)
Use the "Customize your list" box to set up your form: Create the categories of information that will make up
each item in the list. For each column in the soon-to-be-created table that will hold your list (see Figure 12-34
for a glimpse of a finished example), type a name into the box's right side. As you type, the column's name
appears on the left side of the box, in the Columns/Fields to Collect list. Each column—a field if you speak
database—can be one of these types:
Checkbox. Use for yes/no or true/false responses.
Date. For this field type, when someone adds a new item to the list, Google presents a calendar so she
can choose a date from it.
Dropdown. When you choose this field type, the "Customize your list" box expands so you can enter the
choices that appear on the drop-down list—in Figure 12-33, the choices for the Location field when
someone adds a new record are New York, Boston, London, and Austin.
Figure 12-33. As you create fields on the right, Google adds them to the list on the left.

Text. This field type uses a text box to collect whatever someone types into the field.
If you've got another column to put in the list, click "Add another column", and then type another name. In the
list, columns display from left to right, with the top name in the list becoming the leftmost column. You can
rearrange the columns by clicking the up and down arrows in the "Columns/Fields to Collect" list.
Here's an example of a customized list in action: Say you're creating a list of contact information for everyone
involved in your project. You want columns like Name, Extension, Email Address, and so on, to hold the
information for each team member. For each column you want to create, type its name into the "Column name"
box and choose its field type: Text for Name, Extension, Email, and Cell Phone; Dropdown for Location; and
Date for Birthday. Figure 12-34 shows the results.
Figure 12-34. The column names from the "Customize your list" box become the column headers in
the list. For each member of the project team, the record displays the information defined by each
column. To add more people to the list, click the "Add record" button (circled).

12.2.10.5.3. Add records
You can create the greatest column headers ever, but your list doesn't come to life until somebody puts some
data in it. You add items to the list via a form you created when you named and defined columns in the
"Customize your list" box. Click the "Add record" button, and the Add a record box, shown in Figure 12-35,
opens, showing the data collection form. The figure shows different kinds of field types, and how you enter that
kind of data into a form: Type into a text box, choose from a drop-down list, click Choose date, and then select
from a pop-up calendar.
Figure 12-35. The form that collects data for your list results from the way you designed the list in
the "Customize your list" box, using the names and field types you assigned.

When you've filled out the form, click Save, and Google adds the record to the list.
12.2.10.5.4. Delete records
You can delete records from a List page by opening the page, finding the record you want, and then clicking its
far-right Trash can. Google deletes the record immediately, with no confirmation first, so make sure you're
trashing the right record.
12.2.11. Add a Table of Contents
A Web page can be as long as you like. You can put a whole document—complete with chapters and
sections—onto a single page in your site. If you do that, though, you'd better make it easy for readers to find
their way. A table of contents at the start of the page gives readers an at-a-glance overview of what follows.
When you're creating a table of contents for a page, first make sure your page is well organized into sections.
Each section needs a heading that says what the section's about, and you need to use section levels
consistently. The Google Sites page editor offers three heading levels, called H2, H3, and H4. Here's an example
of how you might use them:
Heading (H2): Chapter titles.
Subheading (H3): Major sections within a chapter.
Minor heading (H4): Subsections inside a section.
When you've set up the page with consistent headings throughout, you're ready to create a table of contents.
(Well, you're ready to tell Google to do it for you.) Open the page in Edit mode (click its "Edit page" button),
and then click Insert
"Table of contents". Google does its thing and inserts the table of contents. Click Save,
and Google shows you the results, which look something like Figure 12-36.
Since Google automates the table of contents creation process, you can't edit a table of contents directly. If you
need to make a change, open the page in Edit mode, and then edit the actual heading within the page's text.
After you've edited the heading, you don't need to insert the table of contents again. Just click Save, and
Google updates the table of contents for you, reflecting any edits.
Figure 12-36. This table of contents, generated automatically, shows the different levels of headings
you can use in a page.

Occasionally, some text that doesn't belong in the table of contents might show up
there, anyway. If that happens, it means the text somehow got formatted as a heading,
subheading, or minor heading. Open the page in Edit mode, and then find and select the
text that doesn't belong in the table of contents. With the text highlighted, click Format
"Clear formatting". Click Save, and then check the table of contents again. The
trespassing text should be gone.
12.2.12. Put a Page Link in the Sidebar
To help people navigate your site, in the sidebar (the left-hand menu of links), you can add links to specific
pages. That way, people don't have to hunt around the Site Map ([click here]) to find a page. As your site
grows, you may not want all its pages to appear in the sidebar, but it's a good idea to create easy-to-find links
to important pages.

Open the page you want to add to the sidebar. Click "More actions"
"Page settings" to open the Page
Settings box shown in Figure 12-37. Turn on the checkbox labeled "Show this in 'Navigation' in the sidebar".
Click Save, and then watch the sidebar. A link appears that takes people straight to this page.
Figure 12-37. You can adjust the settings of any individual page within your site.
 

 
12.3. Moving a Page Within the Site
When it's time to do some reorganizing, you can move pages around within your site, making one page a
subpage of another, for example. You can't move or delete a site's home page, but all the other pages are fair
game. Open the page you want to move, and then click "More actions"
Move. The "Move page" box, shown
in Figure 12-38, opens. This box displays a map of your site in hierarchical, or tree, form. To make this page a
subpage of another, click the page you want to put it under. To make a subpage a top-level page, click the site's
name at the top of the tree. When you've indicated where you want to move the page, click Move. Google
rearranges the pages for you. Subpages appear as a link on the "parent" page, between the content and the
Attachments area.
Figure 12-38. You have two options when you're moving a page: Make it a subpage (by selecting the
page you want it subordinate to) or move it to the site's top level (select the name of the site at the
very top of the tree). In this example, the Team Contact Info page will become a subpage of Home.
When you delete a page, you also delete all its subpages. So if you plan to delete a page
but want to hang on to its subpage, then move the subpage up to the top level before
doing any deleting. If you accidentally delete a page that has subpages, then you can
recover that page, along with its subpages ([click here]).

 

 
12.4. Change Notifications: Finding Out What's New
When you've got a million and one things to do, it's tough staying on top of them all. Google Sites can't do your
work for you, but it can make it easier to keep an eye on all the changes happening to any site to which you
have access. When you subscribe to a page, Google sends you an email whenever someone makes a change to
the page. Just open the page you want to monitor, and then, to the right of the "Edit page" button, click its
"More actions" button (you can see it in Figure 12-39). From the "More actions" drop-down menu, select
"Subscribe to page changes". That's it—Google signs you up.
Figure 12-39. The More Actions menu lets you work with the page as a whole in various ways: Sign
up for notification when the page changes; adjust various settings; and print, move, or delete the
page.
Later, if you want to unsubscribe, come back to the page, and then select "More actions"
"Unsubscribe from
page changes".
 

 
12.5. Printing a Page
Nobody's online all the time (not until they invent some kind of wireless-chip brain implant, anyway). Once in a
while, some text printed on a piece of paper still comes in handy. You might want to look over a page on the
bus or train ride home, for example, or pass it around the conference table at a meeting. Printing a page from a
Google Site is simple. Open the page, and then select "More actions"
Print. Google opens the page in a new
browser window, in printer-friendly format. (It may not be as pretty as a page on your actual site, but it's
perfectly easy to read in black and white.) From the new browser window, follow your browser's procedure for
printing a Web page.
 

 
12.6. Adjusting a Page's Settings
When you create a new page, it comes with some default settings that Google applies automatically. But you're
not stuck with those settings. For example, you might not want attachments or comments on an FYI-only page.
To tweak the settings of a page, open the page, and then click "More actions"
"Page settings" to bring up the
Page Settings box shown back in Figure 12-37. The box holds a number of checkboxes you can turn on or off
(there may be fewer checkboxes than the figure shows, depending on the kind of page you're working with):
Show page title.
Show links to subpages ([click here]).
Allow attachments.
Allow comments.
Turn these checkboxes on or off as suits your fancy, and then click Save to apply the new page settings.
NOTE
People with collaborator status ([click here]) or higher can edit page settings, as can Google Apps
administrators, who have unrestricted access to any level of the site. Viewers who aren't administrators
can't change any page settings. For detailed info about site sharing, jump over to [click here].
 

 
12.7. Deleting a Page
When it's time to say so long to a page in your site, open the page, and then click "More actions"
Delete.
Google opens a box that shows you what else will disappear if you delete this page: When you give a page the
ax, you also chop away any attachments and subpages associated with it. So the confirmation box spells out
what else gets deleted if you delete the current page. If you're okay with that, then click Delete.
If you deleted a page and then found out later that you still need the page, after all,
don't panic. Flip ahead to [click here] to learn how to recover a page.
 

 
12.8. Customizing Your Site
You probably wouldn't move into a house in which all the furniture, drapes, carpets, and art was exactly as the
previous owner left it. You'd want to make the place your own. When you create a new site and move in (so to
speak), you want to make that your own, too. Google does a great job of setting everything up for you; it's up
to you to get your site looking just the way you want it. Earlier in the chapter you learned all the things you can
do to customizes individual pages; this section covers how to customize your site as a whole.
12.8.1. Add a Custom Logo
If a site administrator adds a custom logo to the entire Google Apps account ([click here]), then that logo
appears on each of the pages in your Google site. For some sites, you might want to add a different logo. For
example, a project or a university department might have its own logo. Similarly, a site that organizes a student
or employee club or a sports league might want a logo that reflects its own identity. If you're a site owner, you
can add a logo that's specific to your site.
To brand your site with a custom logo, first make sure that you have a logo that fits. Google recommends a
maximum size of 142 pixels wide by 52 pixels high. If your logo is bigger than that, you can try uploading it, but
it may not display right because Google scales it down to fit.
When your logo's all set, click the upper-right Site settings link. On the page that opens, click the Appearance
tab, and then click Site Elements (see Figure 12-40).
Figure 12-40. On the Appearance page's Site Elements tab (circled), you view and edit the different
parts that compose a page. To add a custom logo to your site, click "change logo" (also circled). You
can also edit the sidebar, as [click here] explains.

The Site Elements tab shows the different parts of each page in your site: the header, sidebar, main page
content area, and footer. The header section is where you add a logo. To do so, click the "change logo" link, and
the "Configure site logo" box, shown in Figure 12-41, opens. The box shows these options:
Default logo. If a Google Apps administrator has applied a custom logo to the entire Google Apps
account, then that logo appears here. If not, you see Google's logo.
Figure 12-41. You have three options when you apply a logo to your site: the default logo for your
Google Apps account, a custom logo for just this site, or none at all.

Custom logo. Choose this option to upload a custom logo just for this site. Turn on the radio button, click
Browse, select the logo file on your computer, and then click Open to upload it.
No logo. If you prefer the zen of a minimalist look, turn on this radio button.
When you've chosen a logo option, click OK, and Google applies your choice to all the pages throughout the site.
If you give your site a custom logo, you may want to hide the site's title. If the logo says
CHAOS Project and the title says CHAOS Project, your users may think they're seeing
double. To hide the site title from pages within the site, select "Site settings"
Appearance
 "Colors and Fonts". This opens the page shown in Figure 12-43. In the
list of page elements, select "Site title color", and then set it to white or a color that
matches the header's background.
12.8.2. Change a Site's Theme
To give your sites a unified look and feel, Google has designed some templates, which it calls themes. Themes
range from the whimsical to the no-nonsense, and let you create a sharp-looking site without hiring somebody
to design it for you.

When you create a site ([click here]), you can select a theme for it, but you can change a site's theme at any
time. To do so, click "Site settings"
Appearance. The Appearance page opens with the Themes tab already
selected, as Figure 12-42 shows. This page shows the site's current theme (the one with a blue box around it),
as well as your other options.
Figure 12-42. This book's black-and-white illustrations make it hard to get a sense of the spectrum
of colors different themes offer, so be sure to take a live look at the Appearance page's Themes tab
(circled).
When you see a theme you like, click "preview", just below it. A new window opens, showing how the home
page will look if you switch to this theme. Click around a bit to try on a few different themes. When you find one
that looks good, turn on its radio button, and then click the upper-right "Save changes" button. Google applies
the theme. Click "Return to site" to go back to the site and admire its new look.
12.8.3. Change a Site's Colors
When you choose a site theme (as described in the previous section), Google picks out the color scheme for
you. And those colors look great. But you may want to change the colors of different parts of the pages in your
site: to emphasize the title, perhaps, or highlight the links on a page.
To pick your own colors for various elements in your site, select "Site settings"
Appearance
"Colors and
Fonts" to open the tab shown in Figure 12-43. At the top of the page is a drop-down list of the different page
elements you can change. Select an element, and then click a color from the palette or enter a hexadecimal
color code ([click here] explains about those).

Figure 12-43. The Appearance page has a Colors and Fonts tab (circled) that lets you change the
color of different elements in your site's pages. On this tab, you can also change the font of text that
appears in the sidebar or the body of the page.
As you make your selections, the page preview in the lower part of the page changes, so you can see whether
your text color clashes with its background color. When you like the way the preview looks, click "Save changes"
to apply your new color scheme.
12.8.4. Change a Site's Fonts
While you're playing around with your site's colors, you can try out different fonts, as well. Google lets you
choose a font for text that appears in the site's sidebar or in the body of its pages. Click your way to the Colors
and Fonts tab shown in Figure 12-43 ("Site settings"
Appearance
"Colors and Fonts"). In the page
element list, scroll down to the bottom, and then select "Body font" or "Sidebar font" (you have to make your
selections one at a time).
The color palette disappears, replaced by six different fonts you can choose from: Arial, Georgia, Trebuchet MS,
Courier, Times New Roman, and Verdana.
Turn on the radio button next to a font, and the preview shows how it looks. To apply the new font, click "Save
changes".
12.8.5. Change the Sidebar
Your site's sidebar, which appears on each page's left side, helps people find their way through your site and see
what's been happening there—who's uploaded a file, added some records, or edited a page. When you create a
site, Google sets you up with two sidebar sections: Navigation and "Recent site activity". But you can change
what's in the sidebar: Add a welcome message, site instructions, a countdown to a project milestone or other
big day, and more. You can also edit or delete sidebar sections.

To customize your site's sidebar, head to the Appearance page's Site Elements tab ("Site settings"
Appearance
Site Elements). You can see this page back in Figure 12-40. The Sidebar section appears
beneath the Header and to the left of Page Content. The sections that follow describe the different ways you can
customize the sidebar using the options in the Site Elements tab's Sidebar settings.
12.8.5.1. Move the sidebar
By default, the sidebar shows up on the left side of the pages in your site. To make it jump over to the other
side of each page, click "on right side". To move it back, click "on left side".
12.8.5.2. Add a section
You've got a bunch of choices besides the sidebar's built-in Navigation and "Recent site activity" sections. Click
"Add a sidebar item" to open the box shown in Figure 12-44, and then pick and choose from these options:
Navigation. You've probably already got this in the sidebar. This section provides links to help people find
their way through the site.
Figure 12-44. This box lets you add new elements to your site's sidebar. Scroll down to see all
the options.
Text. If you've got something to say to site users—and want to make sure it appears on every page in the
site—add this section to say it in the sidebar.
Recent site activity. Google automatically adds this section for you, although you can delete it ([click

here]) if you don't find it helpful. It keeps track of a specified number of recent changes to the site.
My recent activity. This item also tracks recent changes, but it does so just for the person who's
currently signed in.
Countdown. This section keeps the team on track by reminding everyone that the clock's ticking as a
deadline approaches.
To get a section into your sidebar, click its Add button. When you add a section, you may have to edit it to give
it some content (keep reading to find out how).
12.8.5.3. Edit a section
When you add a new Text or Countdown section, it arrives without any content; you have to edit the section to
tell it what to say. You can also, of course, edit existing sections to change what they display in the sidebar.
On the Site Elements tab, each item in the sidebar has an edit link to its right. Click "edit" to open a box where
you can make changes to that section. The changes you can make depend on the section you're editing:
Navigation. When you edit the sidebar's Navigation section, the Navigation Configuration box, shown in
Figure 12-45, opens. Here, you can move page links up or down, delete a page from the Navigation list, or
add a new page. When you click "Add page to sidebar navigation", the box changes to show the site map.
Select a page to add, and then click OK.
You can also add a page to the sidebar's Navigation section from the page itself. If
you're on a page and want to quickly add it to the Navigation list, then click "More
actions"
"Page settings". In the Page Settings box, turn on the "Show this in
Navigation in the sidebar" checkbox, and then click Save.
Text. When you want to edit a Text section in the sidebar, Google opens a text editor. Give the section a
title, write and format your content, and then click OK to put your message on the sidebar.
Recent site activity/My recent site activity. Editing either of these sections brings up a box where you
can specify how many activities you want the section to show. The default is five.
Figure 12-45. Set up your Navigation section the way you want it. On the right side of the box, use
the arrows (circled) to move a page link or the X to delete it from the sidebar. You can also add
pages to this section of the sidebar; click "Add page to sidebar navigation" and choose the page you
want to add.

Countdown. Editing a Countdown section opens the box shown in Figure 12-46. Name the event that
everyone's looking forward to (or dreading), and then click "Choose date". A calendar appears. Pick the
date, and then click OK.
Figure 12-46. To pick a date to count down to, click "Choose date" to see a calendar from which you
can select the big day.

12.8.5.4. Rearrange sections
When you add a new section to the sidebar, Google tosses it in at the bottom of the list—and that's probably
not where you want it. To rearrange the order of a sidebar's sections, hover your cursor over the blue bar at the
top of the section you want to move. As you do, the cursor changes to a four-way arrow. Click and drag the
section to its new location.
12.8.5.5. Delete a section
As Figure 12-40 shows, each section of the sidebar has a delete link to its right. To get rid of a section—for
example, a countdown that's expired—click its delete link. Google deletes the section immediately (no
confirmation box to check that you know what you're doing).
NOTE
If you delete a section by mistake, then you can add that type of section to the sidebar again by
following the steps described starting on [click here]. When you delete a section, though, you lose any
edits you've made to that section, so you have to reconfigure the section from scratch: choosing which
pages to show in the Navigation section, recreating the text from a deleted Text section, and so on.

 

 
12.9. Managing Your Sites
An organization can have hundreds of sites: people's About Me sites, sites for project teams, department
sites—the possibilities are endless. As your list of sites grows, whether you own or share those sites, you need
to work with them in various ways: Find one site out of many, share your site with others, track site activity,
and so on. This section explains how to do all that and more.
12.9.1. Find a Particular Site
After you've created or joined at least one site, Google opens the Your Sites page whenever you sign into
Google Sites. The page lists all the sites (in alphabetical order by name) that you own or that you've been
invited to share as a collaborator or viewer. Click any site to open it.
You can reach the Your Sites page from anywhere in Sites by clicking the upper-right
"My sites" link.
Some sites can be viewed or edited by anyone within your organization, but if you haven't been specifically
added to the list of sharers, that site doesn't appear on your Your Sites page. To find such sites, you can browse
all the sites available to people in your organization. At the bottom of the Your Sites list, click the "Browse sites
within mydomain.com" link (mydomain.com is your organization's actual domain name). This click opens a page
where you can select various categories (including "uncategorized") to see sites within that category. Click any
site's name to go to it.
Don't you hate it when you know you saw some text or a document on a site, but can't for the life of you
remember where it was? Luckily, you can search the contents of sites in your domain. From your Your Sites
page (click the upper-right "My sites" link to get there), type a word or phrase in the upper-right search box,
and then click Search Sites. Google rummages through all the sites, and then returns a list of results. From that
list, you can click the name of the page (or the site that contains it) to open the one you want.
NOTE
You can search for page content or page titles, but Google doesn't search site names.
12.9.2. Use the Site Map
Sites can grow to be hundreds of pages. A site map makes sure that nobody ever gets lost wandering around a
site. When you click a Site Map link (if there's not one in the sidebar, then there's a link at the bottom of any
page), you open the page shown in Figure 12-47. The Site Map page has two different tabs to let surfers find a
site's pages in two different ways:
Hierarchy View. This shows the site in a tree that describes the site's hierarchical structure. At the top,
you see the name of the site itself. Beneath that are top-level pages, listed in alphabetical order.
Subpages appear under the pages to which they belong. You can expand or collapse the tree by clicking +

and - signs next to pages with subpages, or by using the "Expand all" and "Collapse all" links at the top of
the page.
List View. Figure 12-48 shows this view. List View arranges all the pages in alphabetical order. You can
jump to any letter of the alphabet by clicking the letter you want at the top of the page. List View gives
more information about pages than Hierarchy View—it tells you who created each page and when, as well
as who last edited the page and when.
Figure 12-47. The Site Map in Hierarchy View shows a "tree" diagram of pages, with subpages
tucked below the pages the belong to. Click a page's - sign (circled) to collapse a section or its +
sign (not shown here) to expand it.

Figure 12-48. In List View, the Site Map shows pages listed alphabetically by title. Here, you get info
about who created a page, who last changed it, and when.

Whether you're looking at the Site Map in Hierarchy View or List View, click the name of any page, and Google
whisks you straight to it.
12.9.3. Share a Site
The whole point of creating a site is to share it with other people: folks on your project team, classmates,
business prospects, and so on. You can even create a site for family members who want to keep up with
everyone's news.
Sharing a Google Site is a lot like sharing other Google apps. So if you've worked with Docs or Calendar, you're
already an old hand at sharing. In Sites, you get to the Sharing page by clicking Site settings in the upper-right
part of any page. If you prefer, you can click "More actions"
"Site sharing". Either way, you zip over to the
Sharing page, shown in Figure 12-49. The Sharing page is your control center for who has access to your site
and what they can do with it.
Figure 12-49. On the Sharing page's left side, you invite people to share your site. The right side
shows whom you've invited, as well as their permission levels.

NOTE
Your Google Apps administrator may restrict your ability to share with people from outside your domain
([click here]).
12.9.3.1. Invite others to share your site
On the Sharing page, find the left-hand Invite people section, and then turn on the radio button of the level of
sharing you want to grant: owner, collaborator, or viewer.
The box on [click here] breaks down owning, collaborating, and sharing privileges.
In the text box, type in the email addresses of people to invite. (Put commas between addresses.) Or, click
"Choose from contacts" to select the invitees from your Contacts list. When you've selected all the people you
want to invite (for now, anyway), click "Invite these people". Google opens the box shown in Figure 12-50. At
the top of the box, you see a list of people you're inviting, along with their email addresses. If you want, you
can add a message and tell Google to send invitations (including a link to the site) to everyone on the list. Or, if
the people you're adding already know about the site, then you can skip sending invitations, and just add these
people to the access list on the right side of the Sharing page.

Figure 12-50. When you share your site with someone, you can send out a formal (or not-so-formal)
invitation to come on over and check it out. Type in an optional message, and then click Send. Or
just click "Skip sending invitation", which gives her access without sending her a notification email.
12.9.3.2. Share with everyone in your domain
Some sites are intended for everyone in an organization, such as an employee handbook or company
newsletter. If you want to grant access to everyone within your domain without having to keep track of who's
coming, who's going, who has access, who doesn't, then go to the Sharing page's Advanced Permissions
section.
The first checkbox in Advanced Permissions section lets you grant viewer- or collaborator-level access to anyone
who has an email address ending in @yourdomain.com (using your actual domain name, of course). Select the
level of permission you want to grant—view or edit—and turn on the checkbox. So, for example, if your domain
name is myvastdomain.com and you want everybody else in the domain to read, but not mess around with your
site, the checkbox label would look like this: Anyone at myvastdomain.com may view this site.

12.9.3.3. Make your site public
Sites are a handy way to share information with people outside your organization. You might, for example,
create a site that lists services or products, trumpets company news, contains employee profiles, and displays a
calendar of events open to the public. Or a university department can create a site that lists courses and links to
faculty sites. In cases like this, you want people to be able to explore your site.
On the Sharing page, go to Advanced Permissions, and then turn on the checkbox labeled "Anyone in the world
may view this site (make it public)". Prepare to welcome the world.
NOTE
Google Apps administrators can prevent other (non-admin) users from making sites in the domain
public.
Frequently Asked Question: Sharing and Privilege Levels
When I share a site, what do the different privilege levels mean?
As with other Google apps, Google Sites have three levels of participants. Each level has different
privileges and can do different things with the site:
Owner. If you create the site, you own it. You can change settings for the whole site, as well
as view, edit, and delete its pages. You can also delete the site. You can grant owner-level
privileges to people when you invite them.
Collaborator. Collaborators can view, edit, and delete pages. But they can't change site
settings or delete the site itself. In Sites, collaborators can't invite others to share the
site—only owners can do that.
Viewer. This permission level lets people look around the site but not change anything—not
in pages, not in the site itself.
Google Apps administrators who share a site have owner-level permissions for the site, even
if you invite them as viewers.
12.9.3.4. Working with others
Most of the time, you keep track of what others are doing on the site by checking out recent site activity in the
sidebar or subscribing to page changes ([click here]). But what happens if you and somebody else both try to
edit the same page at the same time?

When it comes to editing pages, Google takes a first-come-first-served approach. Whoever's editing a page
already gets priority. If someone else is editing a page and you try to edit it, too, you get a message like the
one shown in Figure 12-51, telling you that someone else is working on the page. In this situation, you've got
two options:
Wait for the other person to finish. To get a heads-up when they're done, you can keep an eye on
recent activity or sign up for a page subscription.
Figure 12-51. When you try to edit a page that someone else is working on right now, Google gives
you this message.
Break the lock on the page. Sounds violent, doesn't it? But it just means that you can work on the page
at the same time as someone else. If you want to go this route, click "break their lock".
When you break a locked page, Google opens the page editor, and you can edit the page as you normally
would. But things get tricky when it's time to save. If you make your edits, and then click Save, the save may
be only temporary. If the person whose lock you broke saves after you do, that person's save wipes out your
changes. It's like you never did the work at all.
When you're working on a page and somebody else breaks your lock, you get an Edit Conflict warning like the
one shown in Figure 12-52 when you try to save. This Edit Conflict box represents a lose–lose proposition. If
you click Yes, then you erase the changes the other person made. If you click No, though, you stay in the page
editor forever. Somebody's changes are gonna get lost. Should they be yours or the other person's? Hmmm...
Figure 12-52. When somebody breaks your lock, and then saves her changes, Google warns you that
your save will wipe out the changes the other person made.

Instead of breaking a lock, it's probably better to wait until the other person has finished
editing. That way, no changes get lost. And if somebody breaks your lock and you
overwrite his changes, at least send a quick email to let him know.
12.9.4. Turn Back Time: Your Site's Revision History
If you've worked with any of the other Google apps, you know that Google is fanatical about saving your
work—probably even more so than you are. To see exactly how fanatical, click "Recent site activity" at the
bottom of any page in the site. The Recent Site Activity page, shown in Figure 12-55, is a miles-long list of
additions, changes, and deletions that have been going on around the site.
To find an earlier version of a page, open the page, and then click the upper-right "See earlier versions" link.
You see a page like the one shown in Figure 12-53. The Version History page shows all previous saved versions
of a page. Click a version number to open that earlier version. If you want to change back to this version, make
a note of the version number you're looking at. Click "Back to version history", and then "Revert to this version"
for the version number you want.
Figure 12-53. This page, recently created, has already gone through several versions of changes. The
most recent version of a page appears at the top of the list. To see an earlier version, click its
version number. To replace the current version of the page with an earlier one, click "Revert to this
version".

If you're still not sure which version you want, then you can compare two versions of a page. From the Version
History page, click the number of a version that you think is close to the one you want. When that version
opens, at the top of the page, click "Compare two versions". The page changes to look like the one in Figure 12-
54, with two drop-down lists: "Select first" and "Select second". The version you're currently viewing appears in
the "Select first" box. Use the "Select second" drop-down list to choose the version with which you want to
compare. You can keep selecting different versions from each drop-down list until you're done with your
comparison.
Figure 12-54. This version comparison shows text ("For questions about...") that didn't appear in
Version 5 but was added in Version 6.
When you compare two different versions of a page, Google shows additions to the page as highlighted text and
deletions from the page as strikethrough text.

If you (or somebody else) accidentally deleted a page and you need it back, find the
deleted page in the Recent Site Activity list. Click its name, and Google opens a page
that tells you the page has been deleted. Click "Recover page", and Google restores the
page to your site. Recovering a page also recovers any subpages.
12.9.5. Monitor Site Activity
If your sidebar shows a "Recent site activity" section ([click here]), then you have an idea about what's been
happening on the site in the recent past. If you've got a lot of people all working together at once, though,
activity notifications can come and go in the sidebar faster than you can blink.
To get an overview of what people are doing on the site, go to the footer of any page, and then click "Recent
site activity". You see a page like the one shown in Figure 12-55. For each activity, Google tells you what the
activity was, who did it and when, and which page in the site it affects. Click any page name to go to the page
and see the changes for yourself.
Figure 12-55. The Recent Site Activity page is a list of all the new pages, uploads, deletions, edits,
and other activities that have been happening around the site.
You can receive email notification of changes to the site by clicking "Subscribe to changes" at the top of the
page. When you subscribe to changes, Google notifies you each and every time someone makes a change. For a
busy site, that means a blizzard of notification emails. You can filter ([click here]) and label ([click here]) the
emails so they're not overwhelming, or you could subscribe to changes for a particular page or two that you
want to keep an eye on. To learn how to subscribe to page changes, see [click here].

12.9.6. Edit Site Information
At some point you may want to change the basic information associated with your site. For example, maybe you
want to make the site easier to find in the directory ([click here]), which you can do by assigning it to a
category. Start by going to "Site settings"
Other Stuff to open the page shown in Figure 12-56. On this page,
you can make these changes:
Site name
Site category
Site description
Figure 12-56. To change your site's name, or add or edit a category or description, head to the Other
Stuff page. You can also delete a site from here.

Add or edit text to any of these text boxes. When you're done with your changes, click the upper-right "Save
changes" button.
NOTE
You can also delete a site from this page, as the next section describes.
12.9.7. Delete a Site
The project's over, and you've moved on to other things. Or the club's disbanded. Or you're an administrator
who's learned of a user-created site that's inappropriate for your organization. There are many reasons why a
site should become a thing of the past. If you own a site or you're an administrator of the Google Apps account
the site belongs to, then you have the power to delete it.
When you delete a site, you also delete all its contents—pages, attachments, pictures, gadgets, everything. So
be extra certain that you back up elsewhere anything you want to save. Then, open the site, and select "Site
settings"
Other Stuff. As Figure 12-56 shows, the bottom of the page has a link that says "Delete this Site";
click it. A confirmation box opens, reminding you that deletion means everything goes, and stays gone forever.
If you're sure you want to delete the whole site, then click Delete. Google puts up a notice that says, "Site
deletion in progress. Please wait...". When the notice is gone, so is the site.
 

 
Chapter 13. Beefing Up Google Apps
Google Apps has a lot of nifty features, as you saw in the past three chapters. But that doesn't mean Google's
thought of everything you could possibly need the apps to do. The folks at Google know this, and that's why
they let outside programmers create add-on features. You can find add-ons that let you sync Google Calendar
and Apple's iCal, help you migrate from your organization's current systems to Google Apps, and all kinds of
other neat stuff (people are always coming up with new ones). You can find all kinds of third-party products and
services like these in the Google Solutions Marketplace. Some of the stuff you'll find there is free, while some
costs big bucks. If you don't see what you need in the Marketplace—or can't afford the price tag—you can create
your own add-ons using Google's APIs, a not-so-easy way to customize how Google Apps works. This chapter
covers both the Marketplace and the APIs.
NOTE
This chapter—especially the part about APIs—isn't for the faint of heart. It gets pretty technical, so if
you're not a developer, you can probably skip the second half of this chapter.
13.1. The Google Solutions Marketplace
When you're ready to check out the Marketplace, head over to http://www.google.com/enterprise/marketplace
(Figure 13-1).
Figure 13-1. The Marketplace features Google Apps products and services on the left-hand side of
the page. Browse the categories there, or use the upper-right Search box to find solutions for a
particular app, like Gmail or Docs. If you've created a Google Apps–related product and you'd like to
become part of the Marketplace, then click the upper-right Become a Vendor link (circled).

Although the Marketplace home page changes frequently as new stuff gets added or given top billing, it has
these main sections:
Categories. This section, on the left side of the page, is the place to go to find what you need. Click one
of the categories listed under Google Apps to browse available offerings.
Too busy to browse? To find solutions that address your current need, use the
Search box to look for something specific: Enter the name of an app, like Calendar,
or an issue, like email migration or single sign-on.
Featured Solutions. The right side of the page shines a spotlight on selected solution providers.
Recently Added. This section, in the lower left, shows the newest products and services.
If you like to keep an eye out for the latest solutions, you can subscribe to a
newsfeed that lets you know when the Marketplace adds a new solution. Click the
orange button next to Recently Added to subscribe.
Top Rated. Customers can review third-party solutions; this section features the favorites.

Recently Reviewed. When customers write reviews, the items they've reviewed appear here.
So what kinds of solutions do you find in the Marketplace? Google sorts them into two main categories:
products and professional services. The next two sections give you an overview of each category.
The Marketplace is always changing, as new vendors create profiles and offer their
services and products. Check back from time to time to see what's new.
13.1.1. Products
The products offered in the Marketplace are programs that work with Google Apps to make your life easier.
Costs vary, ranging from good ol' free to "call us to discuss your organization's needs." Some third-party
vendors charge a one-time fee, while others work on a subscription basis.
The Marketplace organizes products into these categories:
Applications and gadgets. This category includes gadgets ([click here]) built to work in Google Apps, as
well as applications that expand the things you can do with Apps, such as a travel booking tool, a tool for
managing customer relations, and a time-tracking and invoicing tool.
Ever wonder who created that handy gadget you use so often? Google's put
together a Hall of Fame to showcase its top gadget developers from around the
world. Check it out at www.google.com/ig/authors. Maybe you'll find the face
behind the gadget.
Identity management. Solutions in this category give you different ways of authenticating the people in
your Google Apps domain. For example, some solutions let you manage Google Apps accounts inside your
own firewall, and enable single sign-on ([click here]).
Migration and sync. Need help moving email or calendar data from your current server into Google
Apps? How about synching an app like Calendar or Google Apps Email with an application or mobile device
Google doesn't currently support? Check out this category.
Click a category to browse it in a page like the one shown in Figure 13-2.
Figure 13-2. When you browse a Product category (like applications and gadgets, shown here), you
see a list of goodies to consider. To read more about a product, click "View full overview" to open
the product's page. To see a vendor's profile, including a list of other products from that vendor,
click the vendor's name.

As you browse a category, click any product's "View full overview" link to open a page with more info about
it—who makes it, what it does, how much it costs. Figure 13-3 shows an example.
Figure 13-3. All the product pages in the Google Marketplace show the product's name, vendor info,
a sample screenshot, an overview (including the price), and a detailed description. Use the left-hand
links (circled) to find out more or download the product.

When you find something that looks intriguing, use the two left-hand links found on most product pages:
Try it! This opens a new window where you can download the product from the vendor's Web site.
Listing homepage. This opens a page on the vendor's Web site, giving you more info about the product.
13.1.2. Professional Services
The Marketplace's Professional Service category is like a yellow pages of companies that can help you customize
your applications, integrate them with your existing IT infrastructure, create custom gadgets, and get your
employees up to speed using Apps. Some specialize in working with small businesses or in deploying Google
Apps within large enterprises.
Here are the Professional Services categories you can browse:
Custom development. If you need a custom solution, like a special gadget, check this category.
Medium/large deployment. If you want an experienced Google Apps specialist to install and configure
Google Apps for your enterprise, take a look through this category. Companies listed here can help you
seamlessly integrate Google Apps with your current infrastructure.
Security and compliance. These providers help you comply with email archiving regulatory
requirements, and keep unwanted or harmful messages away from users' accounts.

Small business setup and support. Don't have an IT department? This category lists companies that
can help you set up Google Apps and make it work for you. Some offer ongoing support, as well.
Training. Whether you need to train users or admins, you'll find a variety of training programs and
courses here.
13.1.3. Creating a Vendor Profile
If you specialize—or even just dabble—in coming up with great products or services that help organizations get
the most out of Google Apps, you can create a vendor profile and get your stuff listed in the Marketplace.
Before you can create the profile, you need a Google Account. If you've been creating Google-related products,
you probably already have one. (Just in case you don't, though, Chapter 1 tells you how to sign up.) Next, make
sure that:
Your solution uses one or more Google APIs or products. After all, that's what the Google Solutions
Marketplace is all about.
Your listing conforms to Google's branding policy and Terms of Service. The box on [click here]
gives the highlights of Google's Terms of Service, but what's the branding policy about? Here it is in a
nutshell:
You have to respect Google's trademarks (that also goes for any other trademark you don't own). So
you can't mess around with the names Google owns: no abbreviating, making acronyms, shortening,
or making up new words like Googletopia or Googlerrific.
You can't imply that your product was created by Google itself, or that you have a special
relationship with, or endorsement from, Google.
Google suggests naming your product like this: Company Name Product Name for Google Product
Name. So if your company, SummerKnights, Inc., has developed an authentication product called
Armor, you might call it SummerKnights Armor for Google Apps, and list it in the directory that way.
Google doesn't guarantee it will approve names in this format, but it gives you a good shot.
Refer to Google Apps in the Google-approved way; don't call it just Apps in your listing—it's Google
Apps, thank you very much. It's also a good idea for your listing to say which edition of Google Apps
your product is for—such as Google Apps Premier Edition.
For Google's full trademark policy—including lists of official Google
trademarks, slogans, and logos—check out
www.google.com/permissions/guidelines.html.

When you're all set, here's how to submit your solution to the Marketplace:
Sign into your Google Account (www.google.com/accounts), and then go to the Marketplace at
www.google.com/enterprise/marketplace.
Google opens the page shown in Figure 13-1.
1.
Click the upper-right "Become a Vendor" link. (You may have to sign in again.)
Google takes you to the Your Vendor Profile page, shown in Figure 13-4. The form on this page requires
basic info about your business: its name, physical address, and Web site. Optionally, you can include your
logo, and a description of your company and what it does.
2.
Fill out the Vendor Profile form, and then click Save.
Google saves your profile and submits it for approval.
3.
Figure 13-4. Before you can list your Google Apps–related products and services in the Marketplace,
you have to create a vendor profile by filling out this form. Asterisks mark required information.
Once your vendor profile has been approved, you can create listings and submit them to the Marketplace to
advertise your product or service. Google has to approve your listings, which usually takes between 24 and 72

hours. If for some reason Google turns down a listing, then you get an email explaining why, so you can fix the
problem and try again.
 

 
Chapter 13. Beefing Up Google Apps
Google Apps has a lot of nifty features, as you saw in the past three chapters. But that doesn't mean Google's
thought of everything you could possibly need the apps to do. The folks at Google know this, and that's why
they let outside programmers create add-on features. You can find add-ons that let you sync Google Calendar
and Apple's iCal, help you migrate from your organization's current systems to Google Apps, and all kinds of
other neat stuff (people are always coming up with new ones). You can find all kinds of third-party products and
services like these in the Google Solutions Marketplace. Some of the stuff you'll find there is free, while some
costs big bucks. If you don't see what you need in the Marketplace—or can't afford the price tag—you can create
your own add-ons using Google's APIs, a not-so-easy way to customize how Google Apps works. This chapter
covers both the Marketplace and the APIs.
NOTE
This chapter—especially the part about APIs—isn't for the faint of heart. It gets pretty technical, so if
you're not a developer, you can probably skip the second half of this chapter.
13.1. The Google Solutions Marketplace
When you're ready to check out the Marketplace, head over to http://www.google.com/enterprise/marketplace
(Figure 13-1).
Figure 13-1. The Marketplace features Google Apps products and services on the left-hand side of
the page. Browse the categories there, or use the upper-right Search box to find solutions for a
particular app, like Gmail or Docs. If you've created a Google Apps–related product and you'd like to
become part of the Marketplace, then click the upper-right Become a Vendor link (circled).

Although the Marketplace home page changes frequently as new stuff gets added or given top billing, it has
these main sections:
Categories. This section, on the left side of the page, is the place to go to find what you need. Click one
of the categories listed under Google Apps to browse available offerings.
Too busy to browse? To find solutions that address your current need, use the
Search box to look for something specific: Enter the name of an app, like Calendar,
or an issue, like email migration or single sign-on.
Featured Solutions. The right side of the page shines a spotlight on selected solution providers.
Recently Added. This section, in the lower left, shows the newest products and services.
If you like to keep an eye out for the latest solutions, you can subscribe to a
newsfeed that lets you know when the Marketplace adds a new solution. Click the
orange button next to Recently Added to subscribe.
Top Rated. Customers can review third-party solutions; this section features the favorites.

Recently Reviewed. When customers write reviews, the items they've reviewed appear here.
So what kinds of solutions do you find in the Marketplace? Google sorts them into two main categories:
products and professional services. The next two sections give you an overview of each category.
The Marketplace is always changing, as new vendors create profiles and offer their
services and products. Check back from time to time to see what's new.
13.1.1. Products
The products offered in the Marketplace are programs that work with Google Apps to make your life easier.
Costs vary, ranging from good ol' free to "call us to discuss your organization's needs." Some third-party
vendors charge a one-time fee, while others work on a subscription basis.
The Marketplace organizes products into these categories:
Applications and gadgets. This category includes gadgets ([click here]) built to work in Google Apps, as
well as applications that expand the things you can do with Apps, such as a travel booking tool, a tool for
managing customer relations, and a time-tracking and invoicing tool.
Ever wonder who created that handy gadget you use so often? Google's put
together a Hall of Fame to showcase its top gadget developers from around the
world. Check it out at www.google.com/ig/authors. Maybe you'll find the face
behind the gadget.
Identity management. Solutions in this category give you different ways of authenticating the people in
your Google Apps domain. For example, some solutions let you manage Google Apps accounts inside your
own firewall, and enable single sign-on ([click here]).
Migration and sync. Need help moving email or calendar data from your current server into Google
Apps? How about synching an app like Calendar or Google Apps Email with an application or mobile device
Google doesn't currently support? Check out this category.
Click a category to browse it in a page like the one shown in Figure 13-2.
Figure 13-2. When you browse a Product category (like applications and gadgets, shown here), you
see a list of goodies to consider. To read more about a product, click "View full overview" to open
the product's page. To see a vendor's profile, including a list of other products from that vendor,
click the vendor's name.

As you browse a category, click any product's "View full overview" link to open a page with more info about
it—who makes it, what it does, how much it costs. Figure 13-3 shows an example.
Figure 13-3. All the product pages in the Google Marketplace show the product's name, vendor info,
a sample screenshot, an overview (including the price), and a detailed description. Use the left-hand
links (circled) to find out more or download the product.

When you find something that looks intriguing, use the two left-hand links found on most product pages:
Try it! This opens a new window where you can download the product from the vendor's Web site.
Listing homepage. This opens a page on the vendor's Web site, giving you more info about the product.
13.1.2. Professional Services

13.2. Google Apps APIs
Google has a Web site designed specifically for developers and programming enthusiasts who want to develop
programs that work with Google products. This site, called Google Code, lives at http://code.google.com. There,
you'll find a variety of APIs for both Web and desktop developers, covering Google Apps and a lot of other
Google services, as well. (If you've never heard of an API before, take a look at the box on [click here]—then
feel free to skip the rest of this chapter.)
To get started with Google APIs, go to the Google Code home page, and then click the "APIs & Developer Tools"
link. The Directory page shown in Figure 13-5 opens. (You can also get there by going straight to
http://code.google.com/more.)
Figure 13-5. From the left-hand menu, select a category, and Google displays it in the Products list.
Click a product to read about it in the right-hand pane. The description contains links where you can
go for more info or to start working with the API.
You can search the Directory using the Search box at the top of the page. Or pick a category from the left-hand
menu to see its products. When you click a product, the Details pane shows information about it. From there,
you can click a link to get started with that API.

Up to Speed: What's an API?
Here's a quick quiz. API stands for:
Aardvark Protection Institute.
a.
Apple Picking Initiative.
b.
Application Programming Interface.
c.
If you guessed a or b, you definitely need to read this box. (On the plus side, you can probably
skip the rest of this chapter.) If you picked c, congratulations! Head straight to [click here] and
start reading about the APIs for Google Apps.
Simply put, an application programming interface, or API, lets one program talk to another
program. An API gives programmers the building blocks they need to create programs to
communicate and work with the applications that make up Google Apps.
An API is a set of programming rules that let one program use features of another. So if you're a
developer (or you play one on TV), you can use an API to build programs that work within a
particular operating environment—in this case, Google Apps. The folks at Google have made it
easy for developers—or anyone with an interest in programming—to write their own programs that
work with Google Apps by creating a series of Google Apps APIs. These APIs let you extend and
customize Google Apps.
The rest of this chapter describes specific Google APIs. This book can offer only a high-level overview—a view of
the Google Apps APIs from 40,000 feet. For more detailed info, visit the Google Code site, and check out the
API you're interested in.
13.2.1. Google Data APIs
The Google Data APIs (http://code.google.com/apis/gdata/index.html) use a standard protocol for reading and
writing data on the Web, using RSS or Atom, which are both standard XML-based syndication formats (XML
stands for "Extensible Markup Language"). Many Web sites use RSS and Atom to send people the latest
headlines, blog posts, and so on. Of these two, RSS is older, but Atom has more features. These APIs also have
a feed-publishing system that comprises the Atom publishing protocol and extensions for handling queries.
Some also use Ajax and JSON (JavaScript Object Notation).
Lots of Google applications and services support the Google Data API protocol, including these APIs, so it's a
good idea to get familiar with the protocol:
Google Apps API

Google Calendar Data API
Google Spreadsheets Data API
Google Documents List data API
Google's written up the basics of the Google Data APIs protocol and published them
(along with code examples) here: http://code.google.com/apis/gdata/basics.html
13.2.2. Gmail Atom Feeds
You can set up an Atom feed to find out what's arriving in your Gmail inbox. For the feed to work, you need an
newsreader that supports the Atom XML feed format. When you get a new email in Gmail, the newsreader lets
you know the message is waiting, complete with a preview of the message and a link to Gmail. To learn more
about Atom, check out http://gmail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=13465.
13.2.3. Account Authentication API
If you're developing a program to communicate with a Google application, you need some way to authenticate
users. Enter Google's Account Authentication API (http://code.google.com/apis/accounts/). It validates access
requests and issues authentication tokens. You can use it to access regular Google Accounts or organizations'
Google Apps user accounts.
Google Account Authentication offers two libraries for developers:
ClientLogin API. If you're dealing with installed applications, such as programs on a desktop computer or
cellphone, which need to access Google applications, then use this library. The ClientLogin API can let a
program sign users in.
AuthSub API. For Web-based applications, use this library, which offers both a standard and a secure
mode. It lets your application gain access to a user's Google data without handling the user's sign-in info.
NOTE
Google services based on the Google Data API ([click here]) support Google Account
Authentication.
13.2.4. Google Apps API
On this page (http://code.google.com/apis/apps), you can find all the Google Apps–related APIs. Several are of
special interest to Google Apps domain administrators:

Provisioning API. This API provides functions that let developers create and manage Google Apps user
accounts. You can synchronize user data between Google Apps and whatever user-management system
you use, so you can manage Google Apps user accounts, nicknames, and email lists.
Email Migration API. This API lets you move your organization's email into Google Apps from wherever
it lives now, preserving messages' date info, read/unread status, and folder info (as Gmail labels).
Reporting API. The API helps you keep track of your domain's Google Apps usage by letting you receive
reports about user activity, status, email storage, and more.
NOTE
The Provisioning, Email Migration, and Reporting APIs are available only in the Google Apps
Premier and Education editions.
13.2.5. Google Calendar Data API
Using the Google Calendar Data API (http://code.google.com/apis/calendar/), your application can create and
manage Google Calendar event info. Google Calendar lets other applications view and update calendar events in
the form of Google Data API feeds. So your application can create, edit, and delete existing events, and search
for events matching certain criteria.
Here are just some of the things you can do with this API:
Migrate scheduled events from your existing system to Google Apps.
Embed Google Calendar event details in your own custom application.
Create a browser page where people view their Google Calendar info from inside your site.
Build an application to sync Google Calendar with mobile devices.
13.2.6. Google Documents List Data API
You can use this API (found at http://code.google.com/apis/documents/overview.html) to build an application
that lets people view, update, and search their Google Docs documents, using Google Data API feeds. The
Google Documents List Data API also lets your application upload documents into Google Docs.
13.2.7. Google Gadgets API

Google invites developers to create gadgets ([click here]) and make them available to the world through
Google's directory. Besides working in iGoogle, Start Page, and any Web page, gadgets can also run in all these
places:
Google Desktop
Google Maps
Google Toolbar
Orkut
Blogger
Google Calendar
Google Sites
Google Docs spreadsheets
MyAOL
IBM websphere portal
RedHat JBoss portal
SUN portal
BEA weblogic portal
The Google Gadgets API (http://code.google.com/apis/gadgets/index.html) uses XML, HTML, and JavaScript to
build all kinds of gadgets, from the simple to the sophisticated. Gadgets get delivered inside an iframe, short for
"inline frame." An iframe is an HTML element that lets you embed an object, including an HTML document,
inside another HTML document. Google offers JavaScript libraries so your gadget can have tabs, display Flash
content, resize itself, and more.
In addition, Google offers these extensions to the Google Gadgets API:
Ads. Create gadgets that double as ads for your organization.

Calendar. This extension, available for gadgets on Google Calendar, runs inside calendars and shows
time-based information like calendar events.
Finance API. Build a gadget to show stock info from Google Finance.
Maps. For Google Maps gadgets (which Google calls "Mapplets"), you can put your own data over maps.
Open Social. Create social gadgets and use them on Orkut, Google's social networking site. Other social
networking sites that support OpenSocial include MySpace, Friendster, hi5, Engage, LinkedIn, Ning, and a
whole bunch more.
Try the Google Gadgets Editor to edit and preview your gadget. It's at
http://code.google.com/apis/gadgets/docs/gs.html#GGE.
13.2.8. Google Gears
Google Gears (http://gears.google.com/) is an open-source browser extension that allows offline access to
applications that usually run only online. Gears lets you work in Google Docs when you're offline ([click here]).
You can use Gears to create Web applications that run offline. Google Reader uses Google Gears, as do third-
party products like Buxfer (a personal-finance application) and the Dojo Offline Toolkit (a set of open-source
tools that let developers create offline Web applications).
Google Gears has three main API parts:
LocalServer caches and serves the application's resources (HTML, images, JavaScript, and so on) locally,
without being connected to a network.
Database is based on the open source SQLite database system, lets you store data offline, and is fully
searchable.
WorkerPool synchronizes data by creating a worker thread pool, running JavaScript code in the
background.
13.2.9. Google Spreadsheets Data API
Like the Google Documents List Data API, the Google Spreadsheets Data API
(http://code.google.com/apis/spreadsheets/overview.html) lets you create applications that can view and
update the content of Google Docs spreadsheets using Google Data API feeds. Your application can request a
list of a person's spreadsheets, and work with or search content in an existing spreadsheet. Through this API,
you can even use a spreadsheet as a database, and access data for another application.
13.2.10. Google Talk XMPP

Chapter 6 tells you how to use Google Talk to send instant messages and chat with other people. Google's
documentation for Talk developers (http://code.google.com/apis/talk/talk_developers_home.html) tells you
how to make your client talk with Google Talk.
Google Talk uses the XMPP open (that is, non-proprietary) protocol. XMPP stands for "extensible messaging and
presence protocol," and it's an open XML technology for communicating in real time, including messaging, voice
calls, file transfers, and getting info about who's online. XMPP means that other services that use the same
standard can work with Google Talk—so all your users have the benefits of real-time communication that Talk
offers.
Here's what you can do with Google Talk using XMPP:
Build a client that connects to the Google Talk service.
Connect your service with Google Talk.
Customize the appearance of the Google Talk gadget.
Create a chatback badge ([click here]) so you can chat with visitors to your Web site.
Jabber, the community that developed XMPP, has a bunch of libraries to help you
write XMPP applications. You'll find them at www.jabber.org/libraries.
13.2.11. Google Themes API
Google Themes, discussed in Chapter 8, let people personalize their iGoogle pages with header art and a color
scheme. If you're both a bit of an artist and a bit of a geek, then you can create your own theme and submit it
to Google's directory. The box on [click here] gets you started creating your own theme. This page takes you
the rest of the way: http://code.google.com/apis/themes.
13.2.12. Google Toolbar API
If you're a Webmaster, you can create custom buttons for the Google Toolbar ([click here]) using XML. You can
create buttons using the Google Toolbar API (http://toolbar.google.com/buttons/apis/), so Toolbar users can
click a button to go to your Web site, search your site, or show an RSS feed in a menu, for example. After
you've created a custom button, people can put it on their Google Toolbars by clicking a link on your Web site or
by finding it in the Google Toolbar Button Gallery (go to http://toolbar.google.com and click the "View button
gallery" link).
 

 
Part 5: Appendix
Appendix A
Appendix A. Keyboard Shortcuts
People are always looking for ways to get work done in less time, and keyboard shortcuts can help you do just
that. Learning them can be kind of tedious, but once you've mastered the shortcuts in this chapter, you'll get
your work done at lightning speed, freeing up more time for fun stuff.
NOTE
As is the style throughout this book, the Windows keyboard shortcut is listed first, followed by the Mac
shortcut (if there is one) in parentheses. Safari users beware: Many of these shortcuts don't work with
your browser—try Firefox if you're a true keyboard junkie.
A.1. Google Docs
There's nothing more frustrating than when you're busy writing your great American novel, fingers flying a mile
a minute on the keyboard—and you have to stop typing and grope around for the mouse to click some button.
Fortunately, you can keep your fingers on the keys and get just about anything done using the keyboard
shortcuts listed in Table A-1.

Appendix A. Keyboard Shortcuts
People are always looking for ways to get work done in less time, and keyboard shortcuts can help you do just
that. Learning them can be kind of tedious, but once you've mastered the shortcuts in this chapter, you'll get
your work done at lightning speed, freeing up more time for fun stuff.
NOTE
As is the style throughout this book, the Windows keyboard shortcut is listed first, followed by the Mac
shortcut (if there is one) in parentheses. Safari users beware: Many of these shortcuts don't work with
your browser—try Firefox if you're a true keyboard junkie.
A.1. Google Docs
There's nothing more frustrating than when you're busy writing your great American novel, fingers flying a mile
a minute on the keyboard—and you have to stop typing and grope around for the mouse to click some button.
Fortunately, you can keep your fingers on the keys and get just about anything done using the keyboard
shortcuts listed in Table A-1.

A.2. Gmail
Before you can use Gmail's keyboard shortcuts (Table A-2), you have to turn them on, but that takes only a few
seconds. Sign into Gmail, and then click the upper-right Settings link to get to the Settings page's General tab.
There, find the "Keyboard shortcuts" section, and then turn on the "Keyboard shortcuts on" radio button. Then
click Save Changes at the bottom of the page, and you're all set.
Before you try to use a shortcut in Gmail, make sure that your cursor isn't in a text box. If you notice you're
typing instead of taking a shortcut, click to move the cursor outside the text box (or hit Esc), and then try the
shortcut again.
Once you turn on keyboard shortcuts, Google displays an arrow next to the currently
selected message so you can tell which message your keyboard shortcuts will apply to.
